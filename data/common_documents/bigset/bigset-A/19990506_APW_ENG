<HEADLINE> Beer Ad in Gay Mag Draws Response </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A Budweiser advertisement showing two men  
holding hands in a free magazine for gays and lesbians has drawn so 
much response that Anheuser-Busch Inc. set up special hotlines to 
handle calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad for Bud Light in the April 22 issue of EXP magazine says  
``Be Yourself and Make It a Bud Light,'' and carries a tagline 
saying ``Proud Sponsor of the St. Louis PrideFest '99.'' PrideFest 
is a gay and lesbian festival held in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the ad ran, leaders in the gay community began  
distributing e-mail, urging people to call Anheuser-Busch in 
support of the ad. The St. Louis brewer was so overwhelmed with 
calls that it set up a hotline for supporters to use. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative Christian leader Jerry Falwell subsequently urged  
his followers to call Anheuser-Busch, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's keep the heat on Anheuser-Busch so that they understand  
that pro-family Americans are terribly concerned about homosexual 
images coming into our homes through reckless advertising 
campaigns,'' Falwell wrote in his Falwell Confidential. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's surprising to us that one print ad placed in select  
gay-oriented magazines has attracted attention,'' the St. Louis 
brewer said in a written statement. ``Today's consumer is not one 
of a specific gender, race, geography or orientation. We appreciate 
and respect the views of all our customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anheuser-Busch officials declined to comment about the results  
of the calls or whether they will have any effect on further plans 
for the advertisement. 
</P>
<P>
	Falwell was unavailable for comment Thursday, his spokesman  
said.

<HEADLINE> Fewer criminals paying restitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The percentage of criminals being ordered to  
pay restitution has dropped despite the 1996 passage of a law 
requiring restitution in certain federal cases, congressional 
auditors said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's counterintuitive. It's puzzling,'' Richard Stana, the  
General Accounting Office's associate director for administration 
of justice issues, told a House subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first seven months of the 1997 fiscal year -- before the  
law took effect at the end of April -- 26 percent of federal 
offenders were ordered to pay restitution, the GAO found. For the 
rest of that fiscal year, ending Sept. 30, only 12 percent of the 
offenders got such orders. 
</P>
<P>
	For robbers, the likelihood of being ordered to pay restitution  
increased by almost half, but it decreased by almost half for 
larceny offenders, and decreased slightly for those convicted of 
fraud, Stana told the House Judiciary Committee's crime panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, a convict's chances of getting slapped with a fine  
or a restitution order varied widely depending on which judicial 
district heard the case, the report said. The range for fines was 1 
percent to 84 percent, and for restitution, 3 percent to 49 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``For example, offenders convicted of fraud in the Eastern  
District of Pennsylvania, which includes Philadelphia, were 13 more 
times likely to be ordered to pay a fine and three times more 
likely to be ordered to pay restitution than fraud offenders in the 
Eastern District of New York, which includes Brooklyn,'' Stana 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	People convicted of drug trafficking crimes in the Western  
District of Texas were 99 times more likely to be fined than people 
convicted of the same offense in the Central District of 
California, which includes Los Angeles, the GAO study found. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, while only 1 percent of drug offenders overall were  
ordered to pay restitution, nearly 66 percent of fraud offenders 
were ordered to pay it, the GAO report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other factors affecting the numbers were the offender's sex,  
race and citizenship, as well as educational levels, length of 
sentence and whether the sentence involved a prison term, probation 
or an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO study did not examine whether fines or restitution  
ordered actually were paid. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors and court administrators told the GAO that some of  
the differences can be attributed to the type and nature of the 
offenses and differing court management cultures. They also said it 
was probably too early to gauge the effect of the law, since 
officials and prosecutors likely still need time to become familiar 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
	People convicted of a federal crime can be ordered to pay a fine  
or restitution at sentencing. Criminal fines, which are punitive, 
are given to the Justice Department's Crime Victims Fund. A judge 
can waive them if an offender cannot pay. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mandatory Victims Restitution Act changed restitution law by  
requiring judges to order full restitution to each victim in 
certain cases -- those involving crimes of violence, some property 
offenses, tampering with consumers products, and offenses involving 
fraud or deceit, for example. Previously, judges could waive 
restitution in those cases based on an offender's ability to pay.

<HEADLINE> Four Killed in Tennessee Storms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINDEN, Tenn. (AP) -- It may take days to restore power to areas  
hard hit by storms that littered roads with fallen trees and left 
four dead, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	This tiny town of 1,300 about 70 miles southwest of Nashville  
suffered the worst, with three killed by Wednesday night's storms -- 
a county trustee, a local schoolteacher and a 14-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
	``This morning we realized this isn't just something on TV in  
some other city. It hit home this time,'' said Capt. Gary Rogers of 
the county rescue squad. 
</P>
<P>
	Homes were darkened overnight from Memphis to Nashville, with at  
least 60,000 without power, though many areas had power returned by 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The storms crumpled houses, splintered trees and left at least  
53 injured. In all, 30 counties were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen-year-old Brandi Mathis was the only family member  
killed when her home was destroyed. Perry County Trustee Hollis 
Hinson, 47, and schoolteacher Patti Haston, 47, died when his home 
was turned to rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm mad but I don't know who to be mad at,'' said Debbie  
Chandler, looking at the concrete steps which were the only things 
left of Hinson's house. 
</P>
<P>
	A man in Madison County was killed when his pickup truck hit a  
tree that had fallen across a road. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, heavy storms tore roofs off buildings in South  
Carolina and knocked over trees and power lines in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	The storms followed Monday's deadly wave of tornadoes in the  
Plains that killed 46. There were also damaging storms Wednesday in 
North Carolina and Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tennessee, shelter for the homeless was provided by the  
American Red Cross, the Salvation Army and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Some areas would probably wait five days before power was  
restored, and cleanup might take longer, said Cecil Whaley, 
director of natural hazards for the Tennessee Emergency Management 
Agency. Some crews might have to be flown in because fallen trees 
blocked roads.

<HEADLINE> Auburn Player Innocent on Harassment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN, Ala. (AP) -- Auburn running back Demontray Carter was  
found innocent of misdemeanor harassment charges in Municipal 
Court, while a teammate was granted youthful offender status on 
similar charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Tigers receiver Reggie Worthy, 20, received youthful offender  
status, and his file was sealed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges stemmed from an off-campus party last month. Auburn  
student Canisha Freeman said the two players poured beer on her and 
that Worthy pushed her and struck her in the face. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter, a 21-year-old junior, started six games last season, and  
was the Tigers' second-leading rusher. 
</P>
<P>
	Worthy, a sophomore, sat out last season for academic reasons.  
He emerged from spring practices as a starting wide receiver.

<HEADLINE> Oregon Town Misses Keiko the Whale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT, Ore. (AP) -- The tank where Keiko the killer whale once  
swam at the Oregon Coast Aquarium has been drained and filled with 
a crane and construction workers transforming it into a new 
exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	Keiko T-shirts are 25 percent off at the gift shop. A brewery  
next door has shipped its last case of Keiko Root Beer. 
</P>
<P>
	And Deb Clark's fifth-graders at Sam Chase Elementary School no  
longer feel like visiting the aquarium, now that their favorite 
attraction is thousands of miles away in Iceland. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was almost like a person, another friend,'' said  
10-year-old Yuanbo Liu. ``I don't think I'll ever forget him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though he was here for less than three years to recover from the  
ills of warm-water captivity in a Mexican amusement park, the star 
of the 1993 movie ``Free Willy'' worked his way into Newport's 
hearts and pocketbooks. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven months since he flew to Iceland, the next stop in his  
odyssey to cold-water freedom, even people who had been cynical 
about what the whale came to mean to this small coastal town 
confess to missing him. 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting in his Big Guy's Diner, Mayor Mark Jones said things  
have slowed on the tourism side of Newport's economy, but not all 
was lost with the whale. A new Burger King opened. A beachside 
hotel is under construction. The academic and government labs 
connected with the Hatfield Marine Science Center are thriving. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whale was like being a star,'' he said. ``Right now, we  
don't have the leading part. But we're getting a lot of bit parts 
and keeping busy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During Keiko's first year in town, aquarium attendance doubled  
to 1.3 million. But it gradually tapered off as everyone expected 
it would. Projections for this year are 725,750 people, still 22 
percent more than before Keiko arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction workers are pouring concrete that will divide  
Keiko's tank into three ocean habitats. When the attraction opens 
in summer 2000, visitors will walk through an underwater acrylic 
tunnel as sharks swim by. Aquarium President Phyllis Bell expects 
attendance to return to Keiko levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Keiko left town, the organization dedicated to his care,  
the Free Willy Keiko Foundation, has vacated its offices and is 
merging with the Jean-Michel Cousteau Institute of Santa Barbara, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Keiko's departure did not leave Newport without whales. On the  
waterfront, tourists can view an orca mural on the side of a fish 
plant or board a tour boat to watch gray whales spouting in the 
ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, a pod of killer whales regularly swims right into  
Yaquina Bay, reminding people that life in the wild and life in a 
tank are different. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are fairly graphic displays, coming up with a sea lion  
sideways in their mouths in front of the Abbey Street pier, going 
crunch and spewing blood and people getting physically ill,'' said 
Bruce Mate, an Oregon State University professor at the Hatfield 
Marine Science Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Yuanbo Liu will remember Keiko not as a killer, but as a  
playmate. Appearing in a Jean-Michel Cousteau documentary after 
winning an essay contest, she became the envy of her classmates by 
playing tag with Keiko in Newport and watching him splash down in 
his Iceland sea pen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he'll be happier there than in some small tank here,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Folding sweatshirts at the Wind Drift Gallery on the bayfront,  
Kevin Sandbo recalled that his cynical heart was won over when he 
and his wife went to see Keiko on his last night in town. When the 
lights dimmed to signal people it was closing time, Keiko took a 
last turn by each of the three underwater windows. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like he was saying, `Goodbye, I'm going home,''' Sandbo  
said.

<HEADLINE> GOP Tries for Tax Relief in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Facing a money crunch, Republican senators  
Thursday began sorting through options for a phased-in package of 
targeted tax cuts as prospects dimmed for significant reductions in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike last year's ``April surprise,'' the Congressional Budget  
Office will not raise projections for this year's budget surplus 
until July 1 at the earliest, a spokesman said. That dashes GOP 
hopes for an immediate infusion of cash for election-year tax cuts, 
particularly important as Yugoslavia war costs rise. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's zip for 2000,'' said Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., a  
member of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Senate Republicans met behind closed doors  
Thursday to discuss proposals ranging from cuts in capital gains 
taxes to relief from the so-called marriage penalty in which many 
two-earner couples pay more income taxes than if single. 
</P>
<P>
	No final decisions were expected, but Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla.,  
said it was a chance for Republicans to ``share their views ... 
about what the plan ought to look like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., chairman of the Senate Budget  
Committee, said he told the group that tax relief totaling about 
$15 billion was possible for 2000. But others said it would be a 
mistake to concentrate on small-bore cuts and to push hard for a 
huge 10-year cut of nearly $800 billion, even if its full impact is 
delayed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to focus on the total amount, not a token tax cut,''  
said Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans began the year touting broad tax relief such as a 10  
percent across-the-board income tax cut, but there are now 
obstacles even to modest cuts. First, the budget surplus for the 
next few years is driven by Social Security funds, money both 
parties have promised not to touch. 
</P>
<P>
	There is also a reluctance to cut government programs already  
strapped by caps on spending and the unknown future costs of the 
conflict over Kosovo. But the GOP is determined not to give up on 
its signature political issue, even if a major tax cut must be 
phased in slowly over the next decade as the non-Social Security 
budget surplus grows. 
</P>
<P>
	They are scouring the budget for ways to offset the costs of tax  
relief in the early years, including serious consideration of 
President Clinton's proposals to close several corporate tax 
shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking to see where there are opportunities to raise  
revenues so we can give the working people a tax cut,'' said Sen. 
William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. 
``We want to give as large a tax cut as we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer,  
R-Texas, has asked the committee's members to each submit three tax 
relief ideas to lay groundwork for a tax bill likely to move 
through the panel in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Most lawmakers believe it will include several items that appeal  
to specific groups as well as extend popular expiring business 
provisions. Clinton took a similar approach in his tax plan with 
proposals such as credits for stay-at-home parents, breaks for the 
steel industry and credits for buyers of fuel-efficient cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Mack unveiled a bill Thursday that embraces several GOP  
priorities: phasing out estate taxes, cutting capital gains tax 
rates, increasing the standard income tax deduction for married 
couples and singles and making the soon-to-expire business research 
and development tax credit permanent. 
</P>
<P>
	Total cost over five years is roughly $140 billion -- partly  
because capital gains tax cuts actually raise money as investors 
sell more securities -- but it balloons to about $750 billion over 
10 years once all the provisions kick in. This will enable 
Republicans to say they are passing a monumental tax cut before the 
2000 elections, even if voters won't see all the results for years. 
</P>
<P>
	But it doesn't appear there will be much Democratic help in  
passing a GOP-crafted bill. ``I frankly doubt that we are likely to 
support what they're going to produce,'' said House Minority Leader 
Dick Gephardt, D-Mo.

<HEADLINE> Networks Nix Forbes' Kickoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Steve Forbes has scuttled secret plans to  
broadcast the kickoff of his Republican presidential campaign live 
on national television, according to an adviser who said TV 
networks would not sell the wealthy businessman air time for the 
Waldorf-Astoria gala. 
</P>
<P>
	The posh and pricey New York hotel will still be the site of his  
first fund-raiser, a June 16 event scheduled to raise $1 million. 
But don't look for it on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes originally hoped to broadcast the June 16 event as part  
of a 30-minute campaign kickoff, according to a senior adviser. The 
aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said plans included: 
</P>
<P>
	--A famous actor introducing a video biography of Forbes.  
</P>
<P>
	--Using satellites to broadcast cheering crowds at Forbes  
fund-raisers in New Hampshire, California and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	--Forbes, his family in tow, delivering a scene-setting campaign  
speech from the Waldorf. 
</P>
<P>
	But the TV networks refused to sell time to the campaign,  
apparently worried about complicated equal-time election laws, the 
adviser said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This being a live infomercial, it wouldn't be something  
national networks do. National networks don't do infomercials,'' 
said CBS News spokesman Kevin Tedesco. ``We have never broadcast an 
infomercial. That's the province of local stations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of other networks were not immediately available for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Unable to broadcast the show, Forbes dropped the idea of  
producing a formal kickoff; he has already announced his campaign 
on the Internet. The June 16 event will be strictly a fund-raiser, 
though Forbes will speak and it will be open to the press. 
</P>
<P>
	The adviser said Forbes may produce a nationally televised show  
later in the campaign, if he is allowed to purchase the time. 
</P>
<P>
	He will travel to Iowa on June 17 and New Hampshire on June 18  
to open campaign offices in the two critical presidential states -- 
a sign that his campaign is heading into a new stage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be the kickoff fund-raiser, the first of more than 200  
fund-raising events between June and February of next year,'' 
campaign spokeswoman Juleanna Glover Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the symbolism of beginning a new chapter of his campaign  
at the Waldorf, she said, ``This is a kickoff fund-raiser and 
nothing else. Holding a fund-raiser at the Waldorf-Astoria is not 
unusual when you're looking at raising upwards of $1 million. It's 
a hotel rich in political history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and other Democrats have held fund-raisers at  
the hotel. A Forbes official said President Reagan once broadcast a 
Waldorf-Astoria fund-raiser to a few cities.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Hears Refugees' Stories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGELHEIM, Germany (AP) -- Listening to chilling stories of  
murder, rape and terror, President Clinton promised refugees 
Thursday, ``You will go home again in safety and in freedom.'' He 
said that with Russian agreement on a common approach in Kosovo ``a 
real peace process'' has begun. 
</P>
<P>
	A refugee driven from her village of Dervar told Clinton that  
ethnic Albanian women dared not have their babies at state-run 
hospitals. ``They would kill the babies, especially the baby 
boys,'' she said. Her own son was born at home on the night NATO 
airstrikes began, March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Women also told of putting mud on their faces to repel would-be  
Serb rapists. ``They killed my brother and his son, two of my 
nephews,'' an elderly woman told the president, whose eyes grew 
moist. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton declared, ``The world will hear your stories.''  
</P>
<P>
	The president concluded a fast-paced trip to NATO's headquarters  
and Germany as Western allies and Russia agreed on the outlines of 
a peace formula for Kosovo. Moscow, for the first time, endorsed 
deployment of an international security force to oversee the 
peaceful return of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a significant step forward,'' Clinton said during a  
stop in Bonn for talks with Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, whose 
center-left governing coalition has been shaken by Germany's first 
combat since World War II. Schroeder called the agreement with 
Russia ``truly substantial progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there is a real peace process under way,'' Clinton  
said, ``but it has no chance of reaching a satisfactory conclusion 
unless we maintain allied unity and firmness. I don't think the 
process is long, but I don't think we can afford to be discouraged 
or be impatient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, the accord with Russia was not specific about the type  
of security presence and did not embrace the West's insistence that 
NATO troops play the dominant role, National Security Adviser Sandy 
Berger acknowledged. Even so, Berger said, ``We're a lot closer 
than we were.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians coming on board -- after weeks of their siding with  
Yugoslavia in opposition to an international military force -- was 
an important step, Clinton said, ``and I was personally very 
pleased by it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even as the diplomacy accelerated, the Pentagon announced that  
NATO is expanding its attack range. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you'll find when it's together and announced that we  
will have basically a 360-degree attack capability against 
Yugoslavia,'' spokesman Kenneth Bacon said. He added that even as 
the diplomacy progresses, NATO's air campaign will intensify. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen ordered as many as 176 more Air  
Force and Marine planes to join the Yugoslav effort. The deployment 
includes 18 more A-10 attack planes, 18 more F-16 jets, 36 more 
F-15 jets, 24 more F-18 jets and up to 80 additional tanker planes. 
</P>
<P>
	The planes are part of more than 300 additional planes requested  
by U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's top commander in the air 
campaign, and bring the number of U.S. planes participating in the 
Yugoslav campaign to more than 800. The Pentagon did not specify 
which U.S. bases will supply the planes, when they will depart or 
how many military personnel will accompany them. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Clinton visited Ingelheim -- a town known for its red  
wine -- to visit 334 Kosovo refugees housed in wood-frame barracks 
at a facility originally built for juvenile delinquents. In 
interviews, some refugees said they were bored, spending their days 
listening to the radio and television, reading newspapers and 
playing table tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	They said they hope NATO stages a ground invasion, and they  
looked forward to returning home -- but not under Serb rule. 
</P>
<P>
	On a chilly afternoon under gray skies, the president spoke to  
refugees on a grassy plot between buildings. He pledged that allied 
forces would prevail over Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and 
force Serb troops from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``You must know that you have not been forgotten or abandoned,''  
the president said. ``Mr. Milosevic has not succeeded in erasing 
your identity from the pages of history, and he will not succeed in 
erasing your presence from the land of your parents and 
grandparents. You will go home again in safety and in freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He visited the dormitory quarters of a family of seven adults  
and two children whose room was equipped with black metal bunk beds 
and metal lockers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were chased from our homes,'' said Sabit Salihu, 60, a  
compact man with facial stubble and a beret. ``My home was burned. 
We were beaten. Everything was stolen from us.'' As he spoke to 
Clinton, Salihu began to cry. His nephew told of young people being 
shot and girls being raped. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the refugees at Ingelheim lived in Kosovo's capital,  
Pristina, and appeared to have come from comfortable backgrounds. 
They said they were driven from their homes by Serb police who 
demanded money and gold and forced them onto trains that took them 
across the border to Blace, Macedonia.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Hears Refugees' Stories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGELHEIM, Germany (AP) -- Listening to chilling stories of  
murder, rape and terror, President Clinton promised refugees 
Thursday, ``You will go home again in safety and in freedom.'' He 
said that with Russian agreement on a common approach in Kosovo ``a 
real peace process'' has begun. 
</P>
<P>
	A refugee driven from her village of Dervar told Clinton that  
ethnic Albanian women dared not have their babies at state-run 
hospitals. ``They would kill the babies, especially the baby 
boys,'' she said. Her own son was born at home on the night NATO 
airstrikes began, March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Women also told of putting mud on their faces to repel would-be  
Serb rapists. ``They killed my brother and his son, two of my 
nephews,'' an elderly woman told the president, whose eyes grew 
moist. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton declared, ``The world will hear your stories.''  
</P>
<P>
	The president concluded a fast-paced trip to NATO's headquarters  
and Germany as Western allies and Russia agreed on the outlines of 
a peace formula for Kosovo. Moscow, for the first time, endorsed 
deployment of an international security force to oversee the 
peaceful return of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a significant step forward,'' Clinton said during a  
stop in Bonn for talks with Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, whose 
center-left governing coalition has been shaken by Germany's first 
combat since World War II. Schroeder called the agreement with 
Russia ``truly substantial progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there is a real peace process under way,'' Clinton  
said, ``but it has no chance of reaching a satisfactory conclusion 
unless we maintain allied unity and firmness. I don't think the 
process is long, but I don't think we can afford to be discouraged 
or be impatient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, the accord with Russia was not specific about the type  
of security presence and did not embrace the West's insistence that 
NATO troops play the dominant role, National Security Adviser Sandy 
Berger acknowledged. Even so, Berger said, ``We're a lot closer 
than we were.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians coming on board -- after weeks of their siding with  
Yugoslavia in opposition to an international military force -- was 
an important step, Clinton said, ``and I was personally very 
pleased by it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even as the diplomacy accelerated, the Pentagon announced that  
NATO is expanding its attack range. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you'll find when it's together and announced that we  
will have basically a 360-degree attack capability against 
Yugoslavia,'' spokesman Kenneth Bacon said. He added that even as 
the diplomacy progresses, NATO's air campaign will intensify. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen ordered as many as 176 more Air  
Force and Marine planes to join the Yugoslav effort. The deployment 
includes 18 more A-10 attack planes, 18 more F-16 jets, 36 more 
F-15 jets, 24 more F-18 jets and up to 80 additional tanker planes. 
</P>
<P>
	The planes are part of more than 300 additional planes requested  
by U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's top commander in the air 
campaign, and bring the number of U.S. planes participating in the 
Yugoslav campaign to more than 800. The Pentagon did not specify 
which U.S. bases will supply the planes, when they will depart or 
how many military personnel will accompany them. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Clinton visited Ingelheim -- a town known for its red  
wine -- to visit 334 Kosovo refugees housed in wood-frame barracks 
at a facility originally built for juvenile delinquents. In 
interviews, some refugees said they were bored, spending their days 
listening to the radio and television, reading newspapers and 
playing table tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	They said they hope NATO stages a ground invasion, and they  
looked forward to returning home -- but not under Serb rule. 
</P>
<P>
	On a chilly afternoon under gray skies, the president spoke to  
refugees on a grassy plot between buildings. He pledged that allied 
forces would prevail over Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and 
force Serb troops from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``You must know that you have not been forgotten or abandoned,''  
the president said. ``Mr. Milosevic has not succeeded in erasing 
your identity from the pages of history, and he will not succeed in 
erasing your presence from the land of your parents and 
grandparents. You will go home again in safety and in freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He visited the dormitory quarters of a family of seven adults  
and two children whose room was equipped with black metal bunk beds 
and metal lockers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were chased from our homes,'' said Sabit Salihu, 60, a  
compact man with facial stubble and a beret. ``My home was burned. 
We were beaten. Everything was stolen from us.'' As he spoke to 
Clinton, Salihu began to cry. His nephew told of young people being 
shot and girls being raped. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the refugees at Ingelheim lived in Kosovo's capital,  
Pristina, and appeared to have come from comfortable backgrounds. 
They said they were driven from their homes by Serb police who 
demanded money and gold and forced them onto trains that took them 
across the border to Blace, Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm young but my life is broken from what I've seen in  
Blace,'' a refugee said. ``The first day I arrived I heard that 24 
children, infants, had died in the camp of exposure, of 
starvation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting on folding chairs in a corridor outside their cafeteria,  
refugees spoke bitterly of centuries-old Serb hatred.

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales Strong in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Most national retailers enjoyed robust sales for  
a third straight month in April, many topping expectations, as 
shoppers remained confident about the economic backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the strong showing should translate into healthy  
profits for the recently ended quarter -- Limited and Ann Taylor, 
among others, have said they will exceed analyst forecasts -- retail 
shares fell sharply on Wall Street Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts noted that because April's sales increases weren't as  
strong as those in preceeding months, investors grew worried that a 
slowdown may be setting in. 
</P>
<P>
	Gap shares tumbled $5.12 1/2 to $64.25 and Wal-Mart fell $2.18 3/4 to  
$42.87 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the underlying tone of business is good,'' said Wayne  
Hood, a retail analyst at Prudential Securities in Atlanta. ``But 
Wall Street doesn't measure things in terms of good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A surprisingly resilient U.S. economy, with low unemployment and  
tame inflation, has kept consumers confident about their personal 
finances and their ability to spend. 
</P>
<P>
	The mood has also been bolstered by the stock market, which  
continued its record-setting pace this week with the Dow Jones 
industrial average crossing the 11,000 mark just amonth after it 
breached 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most Americans are working and feeling pretty good, and that  
is driving traffic into the stores,'' said Steve Paspal, senior 
retail analyst at Sovereign Asset Management, a subsidiary of John 
Hancock Funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The big winners in April were specialty clothing chains, while  
department stores also fared well, especially discounters such as 
Wal-Mart and Kmart. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest sales data shined despite comparisons with the  
stunning performance of April 1998, when sales jumped 9.5 percent 
from year-earlier levels, according to the Merrill Lynch retail 
index. 
</P>
<P>
	The index, the investment firm's barometer of sales performance  
at department stores and discount chains, was up 2.9 percent in 
April compared with the same month last year. The index rose 8.4 
percent in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Some merchants, including Dayton Hudson and the Gap, were hurt  
by the early Easter holiday this year, which shifted most of the 
holiday buying into March. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite some hints of a slowdown, analysts remained confident  
that retailers would report healthy profit gains for the first 
quarter. Most will begin to release their earnings in the coming 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most retailers have had to make minimum markdowns to push out  
merchandise,'' said Walter Loeb, who runs the retail consulting 
firm Loeb Associates. ``I am very optimistic about this quarter and 
about the spring into summer season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, reported that sales  
from stores open at least a year rose 4.6 percent from a year 
earlier, while total sales rose 11.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales from stores open at least a year, known as same-store  
sales, are considered the most accurate measure of a retailer's 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Other retailers' reports:  
</P>
<P>
	--Sears: Same-store sales down 0.9 percent, total sales down 4.3  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Kmart: Same-store sales up 5.7 percent, total sales up 7.3  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--J.C. Penney: Same-store department store sales fell 0.2  
percent, same-store sales at Eckerd drugstores rose 7.7 percent, 
total sales rose 6.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dayton Hudson: Same-store sales down 1.3 percent, total sales  
up 2.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Federated: Same-store sales rose 1.5 percent, total sales up  
12.9 percent. Federated's total sales included revenues from the 
Internet and catalog seller Fingerhut, which it acquired in March. 
</P>
<P>
	--May Department Stores: Same-store sales up 7.7 percent, total  
sales up 12.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Limited: Same-store sales up 5 percent, total sales were flat.  
</P>
<P>
	--Gap: Same-store sales up 1 percent, total sales up 21 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Ann Taylor: Same-store sales up 10.3 percent, total sales up  
17.5 percent.

<HEADLINE>  Death Toll Rises After Tornadoes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Wearing hand-me-down clothes and driving  
borrowed cars, residents struggled to put their lives back together 
Thursday from the ruins of this week's twisters. The death toll, 
meanwhile, rose to 46 in Oklahoma and Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimberly Taylor wore a plaid overshirt, striped T-shirt and blue  
sweatpants as she collected clothes for her six children at a Del 
City church. She laughed at her mismatched outfit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our house was destroyed,'' she said. ``I don't have a car to  
even drive around in. Everything is just borrowed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 3,000 homes and businesses were destroyed in  
Oklahoma. About 1,500 buildings were destroyed in Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	The smell of hamburgers and sauteed onions wafted down one  
ravaged street in Moore, where volunteers served up free meals to 
residents picking through the ruins of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Bulmer, a pastor at Oakcrest Church of Christ, handed out  
sandwiches, water and gloves to people with nothing left. Some were 
so grateful, they were speechless, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of times we have to insist they take things,'' he said.  
``These are proud people. They're not used to being on the 
receiving end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Incredible stories of survival came from hospital beds Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	Angie Todd, her face swollen and bruised, had a broken shoulder,  
a shattered hand and a finger that will probably have to be 
amputated. The 29-year-old woman, her boyfriend and young son 
survived after being pulled from their bathroom and tossed four or 
five houses down the street. 
</P>
<P>
	``I actually remember being in the funnel of the tornado,'' Ms.  
Todd said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the injured died overnight, bringing the number of dead  
from Monday's tornadoes in Oklahoma to 41. Five people died in 
Kansas. About 750 people in Oklahoma and 150 in Kansas were 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The phone at the Oklahoma Medical Examiner's Office continued to  
ring with calls from people worried about relatives unaccounted for 
since the storms. Fifty-four people were on the missing person's 
list Thursday morning, but the number dropped as loved ones were 
located safe and sound during the day, spokesman Ray Blakeney said. 
Searchers have combed devastated neighborhoods with dogs and 
infrared devices. 
</P>
<P>
	James Scarberry, 30, driving a pickup truck lent by a co-worker,  
felt lucky to have found his wallet and ATM card under the bed in 
what was left of his bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess you don't realize everything you're missing until you  
have to look for it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Masteller stood on top of her house, now 2 feet tall, in a  
T-shirt, jeans and shoes that were obviously too big for her. She 
wore an old pair of flowered-rimmed glasses that her son pulled 
from the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is all I've got,'' she said, tugging at the shirt. ``I  
don't have credit cards. I don't have a checking book. Not even my 
wedding ring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The school system in the suburb of Moore, which lost an  
elementary school and a high school, said classes will resume on 
Monday. The 2,200 displaced students will finish the last two weeks 
of school at a nearby college, another elementary school and an old 
administration building. 
</P>
<P>
	The storms damaged or destroyed the homes of at least 1,500  
students and those of nearly 100 teachers and administrators, 
district spokeswoman Susan Pierce said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel strongly that in a time of crisis, one thing the  
school can offer is routine, stability and structure in the school 
day,'' she said. ``It's important for those students who have 
suffered a great loss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Vice President Al Gore toured the tornado damage in  
Haysville, Kan., and hugged people who lost their homes. He said 
the Labor Department will spend $5.7 million to help clean up the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	Victims of the storm were remembered Thursday during a ceremony  
at the Oklahoma Capitol to observe the National Day of Prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been through many devastating things,'' Lt. Gov. Mary  
Fallin said. ``This is a time Oklahoma can be revived. It's a time 
when Oklahoma can be renewed.''

<HEADLINE> Steele's Defense Calls No Witnesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- In a surprise move, Julie Hiatt Steele's  
lawyers rested their case today without calling any witnesses, 
saying prosecutors failed to prove that she had hindered Kenneth 
Starr's investigation of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele is charged with lying to investigators to undercut  
former White House employee Kathleen Willey's allegation that 
Clinton made an unwanted sexual advance. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers asked U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton to  
dismiss all four charges of obstructing Starr's investigation and 
making a false statement to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	When Hilton said the case would continue, Steele lawyer Nancy  
Luque told him, ``Your honor, the defense rests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In opening statements, the defense team had told jurors that Ms.  
Steele would take the witness stand in her own behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele testified before two grand juries that her onetime  
close friend, Mrs. Willey, didn't take her into her confidence 
about the 1993 encounter. Ms. Steele says she first heard about the 
alleged incident in 1997, when Mrs. Willey asked her to lie to a 
Newsweek reporter to corroborate the story. 
</P>
<P>
	The contradiction between the two women's stories was one factor  
that prevented Starr from including the Willey matter in his 
impeachment referral to the House in the Monica Lewinsky 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele is the only person indicted by the independent  
counsel's office in the Lewinsky investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Out of the presence of jurors, Steele lawyer Andrew Hurst had  
argued that even if Ms. Steele had told lies to investigators, 
Starr's prosecutors failed to show the statements were material to 
either the independent counsel's investigation or Paula Jones' 
sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	In arguing for dismissal, Hurst said the affidavit that Ms.  
Steele signed for the Jones lawsuit was deemed unimportant by 
Clinton lawyer Mitch Ettinger, whose testimony for the prosecution 
Tuesday was contentious. 
</P>
<P>
	Declaring that Ms. Steele's statements were not material to  
either the Jones case or Starr's investigation, Hurst said ``I 
would submit, judge, they are trying to blow this one by you'' by 
seeking to convict Ms. Steele for alleged lies that are not tied to 
any official proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hilton said he found ``sufficient evidence'' to go forward  
on all the counts. ``This defendant knew of the Jones case and knew 
of these grand jury investigations,'' the judge said of Ms. Steele. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, prosecutors rested their case after three days of  
testimony, including Mrs. Willey's account of what she described as 
a ``very forceful'' sexual advance by Clinton in a hallway next to 
the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey confided the encounter to at least five other  
people, while Ms. Steele related it to at least three people, 
according to evidence presented to jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	With so many witnesses saying they were told about a  
Clinton-Willey encounter, Ms. Steele's lawyers faced a tough 
argument -- that Mrs. Willey never took her onetime close friend, 
Ms. Steele, into her confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	On the third day of the trial Wednesday, prosecution witness Amy  
Horan testified that she initially refrained from telling Starr's 
grand jury some information because Ms. Steele was so insistent 
that she'd never confided the Clinton-Willey encounter to Mrs. 
Horan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think she was trying to change my story,'' Mrs. Horan  
said of Ms. Steele. But before Mrs. Horan testified in Starr's 
probe, Ms. Steele insisted ``we have never discussed this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Horan testified that ``due to our conversation, I couldn't  
be sure'' that she'd been told of the alleged incident as early as 
1993. The uncertainty made her hold back telling that to the grand 
jury. But Mrs. Horan testified she is positive Ms. Steele told her 
of the alleged advance in September 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Horan said Ms. Steele's legal team made her feel ``awful''  
before the trial in the course of ``four or five'' phone calls and 
four face-to-face meetings. They reminded Mrs. Horan that her 
friend Ms. Steele ``was facing 20 to life'' if convicted, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Mrs. Horan, two other witnesses -- longtime friend Mary  
Highsmith and Richmond, Va., TV producer William Poveromo -- said 
Ms. Steele informed them of the alleged incident. 
</P>
<P>
	There was testimony at the trial that Mrs. Willey told at least  
five other people besides Ms. Steele: Ruthie Eisen, Linda Tripp, 
Marlene MacDonald, Betsy Pond, all of whom are former White House 
staffers; and a Virginia woman, Diane Martin.

<HEADLINE> Man Sentenced for Hot Tub Drowning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A man serving a life sentence for suffocating  
his first wife in a bathtub was given the death penalty Thursday 
for strangling his second wife in a hot tub. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentence was handed out by the same jury that found Timothy  
Boczkowski, 43, guilty of murder in the 1994 death of Maryann 
Boczkowski, 35, at the couple's Pittsburgh home. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said he killed her because he did not want children  
and she was about to leave him. The defense argued that she drowned 
after sudden heart or liver failure brought on by years of heavy 
drinking. 
</P>
<P>
	Her death prompted authorities to reopen an investigation into  
the death of Boczkowski's first wife, Elaine, 34, four years 
earlier in Greensboro, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Boczkowski said his first wife had drowned after drinking, but  
an autopsy concluded the cause of death was chest compression. He 
was convicted of her death in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Tagliabue Urges Support for Patriots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue urged area  
business leaders to purchase high-end seats and suites in order to 
help the New England Patriots build a new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody knows it's going to be difficult,'' Tagliabue told  
about 500 people today at the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce 
annual meeting and dinner. ``There will be suites that need to be 
purchased. There will be premium seats that need to be purchased.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue said a partnership between the NFL, state government  
and private investors is needed to make the stadium work. He cited 
stadium ventures in Buffalo, Detroit and Seattle as successful 
examples. 
</P>
<P>
	Apart from encouraging teamwork, Tagliabue mentioned no specific  
locations or deadlines for a new Patriots stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Meetings last month between Tagliabue, Gov. Paul Cellucci and  
legislative and business leaders preceded the collapse of a $380 
million stadium proposal in Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL has supported keeping the team in the Boston area, which  
has the nation's sixth largest television market; Hartford has the 
27th. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts lawmakers have proposed paying $70 million for  
infrastructure supporting a new stadium in Foxboro, the team's 
current home. But Patriots owner Robert Kraft would have to pay for 
the stadium, though it would be partly financed through favorable

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Pitcher Injured Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Often-injured St. Louis Cardinals pitcher  
Donovan Osborne may be headed for the disabled list again. 
</P>
<P>
	Osborne, who missed most of the last two seasons due to assorted  
injuries, left Thursday night's 13-3 loss to Pittsburgh after four 
innings with tightness in his shoulder. He's already been on the 
disabled list six times and missed the entire 1994 season after 
reconstructive shoulder surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Osborne (1-3) wasn't sure when he was hurt. He threw 75 pitches  
and allowed four runs on seven hits. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're in the heat of the battle, you try to do what you  
can out there,'' Osborne said. ``It just really tightened up that 
last inning. That's it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Osborne, 29, has started only 14 games each of the last two  
seasons because of a hernia, two groin injuries and a shoulder 
injury. He wasn't optimistic about making his next start on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure,'' he said. ``I'll just pray.''  
</P>
<P>
	Manager Tony La Russa already has a game plan for doing without  
him, with Manny Aybar replacing him in the rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was in the heat of the moment in the game and he said, `I  
couldn't go any longer,''' La Russa said. ``He indicated he had 
some problems, so we'll get a doctor in to check him and see what 
it all means.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aybar, who has thrown 11 consecutive scoreless innings of  
relief, actually is a good bet to fill in for Kent Mercker on 
Sunday. Mercker threw 3 2-3 innings of relief on Thursday and 
allowed four earned runs, but would likely stay in the rotation 
despite a 7.48 ERA.

<HEADLINE> Bacteria-Control Gene Identified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a discovery that could lead to powerful new  
vaccines and antibiotics, researchers have isolated a key gene that 
bacteria use to launch killer infections. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara, have  
demonstrated in laboratory studies that removing or inactivating a 
gene called DAM can disarm a strain of salmonella, bacteria that 
cause food poisoning in humans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've uncovered a genetic master switch that controls  
bacterial infection,'' said Dr. Michael J. Mahan, the study's lead 
author and a UCSB professor. ``When we knock out this switch, the 
bacterium is completely disabled in its ability to cause disease.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study is to be published Friday in the journal Science.  
</P>
<P>
	Mahan said the DAM gene was found through a five-year process of  
examining bacterial genes that are turned on at the start of an 
infection in a host animal. Often these genes are quiet in 
laboratory dishes and go into action only when the pathogen is 
starting an infection inside an animal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bacterial pathogens act like a Trojan horse -- they hide their  
weapons until they are within an animal,'' said Mahan. As a result, 
some bacterial genes that cause infection ``are turned on inside a 
mouse and off outside a mouse,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The UCSB researchers, using salmonella, found that the DAM gene  
made a protein that turned on other genes that started the 
infection process. 
</P>
<P>
	When strains of salmonella were created that permanently  
disabled the DAM gene, the microbe could not cause disease in mice. 
</P>
<P>
	The altered bacteria also acted like a vaccine, causing the  
mouse's immune system to make antibodies that would attack 
salmonella, said Mahan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mice immunized with this crippled strain of salmonella were  
completely protected from infection,'' he said. Some of the mice 
were injected with a salmonella dose 10,000 times more powerful 
than a dose that is lethal to half of all mice. None of the animals 
developed disease, said Mahan. 
</P>
<P>
	There are 2,500 strains of salmonella that cause diseases  
ranging from food poisoning to typhoid fever. Poorly cooked poultry 
and eggs are a common source of salmonella food poisoning, and some 
experts have estimated that up to 4 million Americans are affected 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
	A variety of other bacteria pathogens, including cholera, plague  
and Shigella dysentery, also have DAM genes, raising the 
possibility that those diseases could also be disabled by blocking 
DAM. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahan said it may be possible to make an antibiotic based on the  
DAM gene. If a chemical could be found that blocks the action of 
the protein made by DAM, then it might prevent bacteria from 
continuing the infection process, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a breakthrough discovery,'' said Dr. Philip Hanna, a  
microbiologist at Duke University Medical Center. ``They have found 
a master switch that turns on virulence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If further study proves that disabling the DAM genes will  
protect humans from bacterial infection, it could lead to a new 
class of antibiotics and to a new type of vaccine, Hanna said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dr. Regina Rabinovich, a scientist at the National Institute  
of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a part of the National 
Institutes of Health, cautioned that the value of the DAM research 
will not be known until it is tested and proven to work in humans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mouse has not been a very good model for what will happen  
with salmonella in humans,'' said Rabinovich. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical researchers are scrambling to find new ways of combating  
infections that now claim about 17 million lives annually worldwide 
-- almost three times the death toll of cancer. Many antibiotics 
that once worked are no longer effective against evolving strains 
of bacteria. Even vancomycin, the ``last hope'' antibiotic that 
once was invariably effective, has recently encountered germs it 
cannot control. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are about to re-enter the pre-antibiotic era because there  
are pathogen strains now that are resistant to every available 
antibiotic,'' said Mahan. ``This (altering the DAM gene) may buy us 
some time.''

<HEADLINE> Cleaves To Stay at Michigan State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- All-America point guard Mateen Cleaves  
will remain at Michigan State for another year rather than make 
himself available for the NBA draft, the Lansing State Journal 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy with the decision,'' Cleaves told the newspaper.  
``I'd been leaning that way all along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-2, 190-pound Cleaves was to discuss his decision at a  
news conference scheduled for 4 p.m. EDT today. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves met for about two hours Wednesday with his mother, Fran  
Cleaves, basketball coach Tom Izzo, and longtime friend and adviser 
Charles Tucker, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	During that meeting, Cleaves and his advisers discussed all  
options, including his NBA opportunities and the Spartans' 
prospects for a third consecutive Big Ten title and their bid for 
an NCAA championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a good meeting,'' Cleaves told the State Journal.  
``Everyone heard what the others were thinking. And I'll talk about 
all the factors in my decision at the press conference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves had refused to indicate what his decision would be,  
although his mother has said she would like her son to return to 
Michigan State next season in pursuit of his degree.

<HEADLINE>  Oklahomans Return to Tornado Scene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- When John and Sheryl Molsbee were allowed  
back to their brick-and-frame home Wednesday, the roof was gone but 
Monday's macaroni dinner was still in a pot on the stove. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's worse than I thought,'' said John Molsbee, who wasn't  
home when extraordinarily massive twisters leveled 3,000 homes and 
killed 38 people in Oklahoma. Five people were killed by tornadoes 
in Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told you it was,'' said his wife, who hid with their  
19-year-old daughter, Kristy, under a blue flowered mattress in the 
master bedroom, then helped pull injured people from the wreckage 
left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	The Molsbees were among hundreds of people left homeless by the  
tornadoes who were allowed to return Wednesday to assess the 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials had received about 100 missing persons reports, but  
they were uncertain how many were duplicates. A master list of 
those unaccounted for was expected by Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelters were made available throughout the area for short-term  
housing, while officials made long-term arrangements for the 
suddenly homeless. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not talking tent cities,'' said Ben Frizzell of the  
state Office of Civil Emergency Management. ``There is a disaster 
housing program through FEMA that will provide rental assistance 
for up to 18 months if needed. Some people may even use this to 
rent travel trailers to put on their property.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American Red Cross also passed out vouchers for people to  
stay in motels until other provisions could be made. Churches 
distributed food and clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	Bucky Kilbourne, who was running a shelter at the Midwest City  
Community Center, said 220 people took refuge there Monday night, 
but the number had dwindled to 60 by Wednesday. He said hearing the 
stories of the displaced was almost more than he could bear. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything they hold dear, things they need -- from medicine to  
books to personal belongings -- all gone,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said nearly 700 people were injured in the deadliest  
tornado to hit Oklahoma since 1947. The damage estimate has been 
placed at more than $225 million in Oklahoma and more than $140 
million in Kansas, where 1,129 buildings were destroyed in Monday's 
storms. 
</P>
<P>
	More twisters swarmed across parts of Texas and Arkansas on  
Tuesday, killing one person. And late Wednesday, strong winds were 
blamed for three deaths in Tennessee and for closing the Nashville 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Two people were killed in a home in Linden, 70 miles southwest  
of Nashville, said Capt. Gary Rogers of the Perry County rescue 
squad. Rescue crews were also searching for a 14-year-old girl near 
the community. 
</P>
<P>
	In western Tennessee, a motorist was killed when his car hit a  
downed tree, Madison County Sheriff David Woolfork said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has authorized emergency disaster declarations  
for Oklahoma and Kansas, paving the way for federal emergency funds 
for home and business owners. The Federal Emergency Management 
Agency had 300 staff members on hand to assist victims and 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	All around Oklahoma City, cars -- some with smashed windows --  
formed grim processions as those lucky enough to have survived 
passed through police and National Guard checkpoints to view what 
was left of their homes before curfews resumed at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Oakcrest Church of Christ, Jean Clemence of Moore was  
walking around in a daze as her children gathered canned goods and 
other non-perishables from a food pantry hastily set up in a Sunday 
school class. 
</P>
<P>
	She and her boyfriend had ordered a storm cellar back in  
November, but the man who was supposed to install it dug the hole 
and just left it. Ms. Clemence said she had asked for the down 
payment back, and the man promised to come back Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's six months too late,'' she said. ``We're going to get our  
money back, I don't care. I think he owes us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Haysville, Kan., sheet metal worker Calvin Waters called  
himself fortunate, even as he spent a second day trying to clear 
debris, patch holes in his house's roof and mop up water damage. He 
was shaken by the deaths of a woman and 1-month-old baby near his 
home, even though he did not know them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always think a child should get a chance to grow up,'' he  
said. ``If you have to take two people, don't take a baby child. 
Take me, I'm 44 years old.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Molsbees' neighborhood in Oklahoma City, Shirley and  
Bennie Johnson's house was serving as a restroom retreat. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got running water. If you've got to go, then come on  
in,'' Mrs. Johnson said. The house escaped with just shattered 
windows and cracked sheet rock. The 21 pictures of Southwestern art 
still hung in the living room. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Johnson held up real estate fliers on the kitchen counter.  
</P>
<P>
	``We had this house for sale. A couple even checked it out  
Monday afternoon,'' Mrs. Johnson said. ``Now, it's real cheap.''

<HEADLINE> NBC Extends Breeders' Cup Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- NBC has extended its contract to broadcast  
the Breeders' Cup championship through 2001, the Breeders' Cup said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The network's five-year deal to broadcast the championship races  
was to have expired after this year's Breeders' Cup on Nov. 6 at 
Gulfstream Park in Hallandale, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC has broadcast every Breeders' Cup since the event's  
inception in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very pleased to continue broadcasting one of the great  
days in American sport,'' NBC Sports president Ken Schanzer said. 
``The Breeders' Cup is one of a select few events created within 
the past 30 years that has become a major championship. We look 
forward to further strengthening our association with the Breeders' 
Cup through this extension.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC recently announced it will broadcast four one-hour ``Road to  
the Breeders' Cup'' programs this fall. Those broadcasts will 
feature major stakes races leading up to the day of championship 
races. 
</P>

	Officials declined to discuss financial terms of the contract  
extension.

<HEADLINE> UN Gets Sizable Role in Kosovo Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The new peacekeeping plan for Kosovo approved  
by the United States, Russia and six other nations is designed to 
win over Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic while ensuring the 
tormented ethnic Albanian refugees can return to their homes in 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
	It assigns a prominent role to the United Nations, which could  
have an impact on the troops' mission if Russia, China or other 
Security Council members that opposed NATO's air campaign are able 
to limit the weapons the troops carry or the force they can apply 
to protect returned refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said after a  
briefing by State Department and Pentagon officials Thursday that 
the force ``could well not include Americans,'' there seems to be 
little doubt there will be a sizable U.S. contingent, as there is 
helping to keep the peace next door in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	The 28,000-member force initially planned for Kosovo is now  
considered too small to monitor the postwar resentment that could 
boil over into violence even after most of the Serb troops and 
paramilitary units depart the province. 
</P>
<P>
	The force could expand to 60,000, with a proportionally larger  
U.S. share than the 4,000 considered at the outset. 
</P>
<P>
	That guarantees the Clinton administration will not budge from  
its insistence that the American troops be under the control of 
American commanders. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor is the United States apt to replicate U.N.-run operations in  
Bosnia-Herzegovina that failed to deter civilian atrocities before 
a combination of NATO attacks on the Serbs and a Croatian offensive 
produced the Dayton accords in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	That ``dual-key'' arrangement in which the United Nations shared  
power with NATO slowed and in some cases blocked the troops from 
intervening to stop mayhem against civilians. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger,  
described the security force approved Thursday by the Group of 
Eight foreign ministers as a ``robust presence that would not only 
be able to defend itself but maintain civil order.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The communique issued at the meeting in Bonn, Germany, referred  
merely to ``effective international civilian and security 
presences,'' without any direct reference to NATO itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Troops from Russia, Ukraine and other countries friendly to  
Yugoslavia are likely to be included, and possibly from such NATO 
nations as Greece and Portugal, which have not actively engaged in 
the 6-week-old NATO attacks on the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States gave ground, as Clinton signaled he was  
willing to do when he declared before going to Germany that he was 
open to negotiate the composition of the force. So did Russia, 
which had opposed armed peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials depicted the agreement reached by the United  
States, Russia, Germany, Britain, France, Canada, Italy and Japan 
as one in which Moscow mostly moved closer to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian line is otherwise.  
</P>
<P>
	Sergey Lavrov, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, said  
the agreement reflected Russia's long-held call for an 
international presence for Kosovo authorized by the Security 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am glad that this is now accepted by our Western partners,''  
he told reporters in New York. ``I am sorry that it took them one 
and a half months of bombing to come to the same solution which we 
were offering. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not to say that we are already there. We would still  
have to see how the details of those arrangements could be 
negotiated, and this would require good will on both sides as was 
repeatedly stressed by Russian leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the outset, the Clinton administration spoke in terms of a  
NATO force, then called it a NATO-led force, and then the term 
evolved to a force with NATO at its core. The communique omitted 
even that construction. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic, meanwhile, has moved from outright opposition to any  
peacekeeping force in Kosovo. His negotiators refused even to 
discuss the concept at talks in Rambouillet, France, in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Under relentless NATO hammering, the Yugoslav president has  
backed down and said he would consider a peackeeeping contingent 
that was unarmed or carried only light weapons. He also insisted on 
keeping 11,000 Serb troops in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has flatly rejected both proposals,  
and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Thursday security 
for ethnic Albanians ``must mean a strong military force with NATO 
at its core.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But with the United States and Russia beginning to close ranks  
on peacekeeping operations, the stage is set for a new diplomatic 
overture to Belgrade. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is due here 
on Friday to meet with Albright and keep the diplomatic wheels 
turning. 
</P>
<P>
	Still to be heard from is Milosevic, who in a preliminary  
reaction Thursday said through state-run media that a political 
settlement was possible after NATO halted its bombing campaign.

<HEADLINE> Smoltz Best in Majors Since 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- It was a little more than three years ago that  
John Smoltz decided he needed a change. 
</P>
<P>
	So he came up with an offspeed pitch to go along with his 90  
mph-plus fastball and his nasty breaking pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, he's been dominating. Smoltz has won 61 games -- more  
than any other pitcher in the major leagues -- since 1996, the year 
he won the NL Cy Young Award. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Braves right-hander, who turns 32 next week, won his  
ninth straight decision Wednesday in a 12-3 victory over the St. 
Louis Cardinals. He allowed three runs -- two earned -- and five hits 
in seven innings. He also had two of Atlanta's hits and raised his 
batting average to .375. 
</P>
<P>
	``That might have been his worst game of the year. If it was,  
I'll take that the rest of the year,'' manager Bobby Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that I have a changeup, I have a way of slowing the  
hitters down,'' said Smoltz, who is 5-0 and leads the NL with a 
1.69 ERA. ``Everything used to be hard, hard, hard. Now they can't 
look one way. It's been a weapon since I started throwing it, and 
will continue to be a weapon for me,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, coming off elbow surgery, Smoltz went 17-3. He is  
17-1 since the 1998 All-Star break, losing only to Houston, 4-3 on 
Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like he's in the hitters' head,'' Atlanta third baseman  
Chipper Jones said. ``Whatever they are looking for, he's throwing 
something else and making them look bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smoltz sometimes seeks out Tom Glavine, who won Cy Young Awards  
in 1991 and 1998, and Greg Maddux, who won the award for four 
straight times from 1992-95. Both have relied heavily on changeups. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pick Glavine's and Maddux's brain about how to throw it,  
when to throw it and how to fix it when I'm throwing it badly,'' 
Smoltz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoltz has a 151-105 career record. Prior to 1996, he was 90-82;  
since then, he's 61-23. 
</P>
<P>
	``I try not to think about my numbers. I honestly haven't looked  
at my stats this year,'' Smoltz said. ``I just don't want to get 
carried away with what's happening. Right now I feel like I'm in a 
pretty good groove and can't wait for my next start.''

<HEADLINE> Lobbyists Push Banking Overhaul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As a March snowstorm paralyzed the capital,  
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm gathered 40 lobbyists 
for the banking, insurance and securities industries to deliver a 
blunt message. 
</P>
<P>
	If they wanted to eliminate Depression-era barriers prohibiting  
banks, securities firms and insurance companies from delving into 
each other's business, they were ``going to have to do some work,'' 
declared Gramm, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months later, a final vote was near on Thursday in the  
Senate, where the same legislation died just six months earlier. 
The measure is the product of a furious lobbying effort that paired 
a powerful committee chairman with cash-flush industries in the 
battle to reverse doubts among lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the legislation was doomed both by concerns it would  
create financial superstores unfriendly to consumers and squabbles 
over whether to repeal requirements that financial institutions 
demonstrate they have made loans to minorities and low-income 
people in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing was left to chance this time.  
</P>
<P>
	The American Bankers Association flew in 200 bankers from around  
the country this week to meet with senators. The Securities 
Industry Association's Web site flashed ``Urgent!'' and asked 
visitors to send a form letter to their senators. 
</P>
<P>
	And Merrill Lynch, the brokerage firm, ran weekly newspaper ads  
directed at lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	But what set this lobbying effort apart from the many each year  
in Washington was the extensive role Gramm played in organizing it. 
Since the March gathering, he has continued to meet regularly with 
the lobbyists to discuss their strategy and get progress reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm's office said he got the idea from watching Sen. Robert  
Byrd, D-W.Va., mobilize interest groups in the last Congress to 
successfully amend the surface transportation bill to ensure 
gasoline taxes were spent on highways. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking nothing for chance, the Texas Republican has done plenty  
of lobbying of his own, buttonholing more than half of his 99 
colleagues to make his own pitch. ``I find that in talking to 
people face-to-face, you tend to get their attention,'' Gramm said. 
</P>
<P>
	Observed Sen. Spence Abraham, R-Mich: ``He's been briefing  
everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm, a longtime supporter of the financial industry, has  
received $1.8 million in campaign contributions between 1993 and 
1998 from banks, savings and loans, insurers and securities firms. 
That's more than any other member of the Senate, according to the 
Center for Responsive Politics. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry has much invested in Congress, doling out $23.3  
million to congressional candidates in the 1998 election cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm's bill would make it easier for banks, securities firms  
and insurance companies to enter each other's business. 
</P>
<P>
	A bank, for example, could write insurance and sell stocks in  
addition to offering savings and checking accounts. A firm that 
sells stocks could also sell insurance and set up its own bank. 
Consumers would shop at, in Gramm's words, ``a supermarket for 
financial services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the bill are not nearly as well-heeled. Three  
consumer groups opposing the legislation -- Consumers Union, the 
Consumer Federation of America, and the U.S. Public Interest 
Research Group -- spent $540,000 to lobby during the last six months 
of 1998. Three industry groups lobbying for the bill -- the American 
Bankers Association, the Securities Industry Association and the 
American Council of Life Insurance -- spent 12 times that, or $6.7 
million, during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the opponents are making their position known. Some are  
lobbying against a provision in the legislation that exempts small 
banks from the Community Redevelopment Act, which requires 
financial institutions to document how they invest money in all 
communities that they receive deposits from. 
</P>
<P>
	Community development organizations have sent letters telling  
real-life success stories, like that of the New York City 
businesswoman who received a loan to start her company and the 
Mississippi resident who got a home mortgage, all because banks had 
to provide money under the CRA. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's one of the things local groups can talk to their  
senators about, these kinds of details about what's happening in 
their communities,'' said Debby Goldberg, a neighborhood 
reinvestment specialist with the Center for Community Change. The 
nonprofit organization works with community groups in low-income 
and minority neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports, asked two  
Democratic senators to sponsor an amendment requiring banks to 
offer basic, low-cost accounts to consumers, known as lifeline 
banking.

<HEADLINE> Senate Passes Banking Overhaul Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate on Thursday passed sweeping  
legislation that would lift Depression-era barriers and let banks, 
securities firms and insurance companies get more deeply into each 
other's businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The mostly party-line vote was 54-44 on the bill, which faces a  
likely presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration supports such legislation in  
principle. But in a showdown with Senate Banking Committee Chairman 
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, it has threatened a presidential veto of the 
bill unless there are major changes. They include the removal of 
provisions that Democrats view as an attack on the 1977 Community 
Reinvestment Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think in the end, the president's going to have to decide,  
is he for a financial modernization bill,'' Gramm told reporters 
during the evening vote, which followed 2 1/2 days of debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm said he believed it was possible to work out a compromise  
on the issues of contention. 
</P>
<P>
	Proponents of the financial overhaul legislation, led by Wall  
Street and the insurance industry, maintain it is needed to keep 
the U.S. financial industry competitive in global markets and that 
it would save consumers billions by providing one-stop financial 
shopping. The financial industries have spent millions in recent 
years lobbying for the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The banking industry already has won permission from federal  
regulators in recent years to skirt some of barriers separating 
financial industries that were erected by the 1933 Glass-Steagall 
Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The chances of a presidential veto also were increased Thursday  
when the Senate rebuffed an effort by Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., 
and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., to steer the 
legislation toward the view of Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and 
the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	An amendment proposed by Shelby and Daschle brought to the  
Senate floor a long-simmering debate between the administration and 
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, supported by most 
Republicans, over the best bank corporate structure to allow in 
revamping the financial services laws. It was killed on a 53-46 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin and the administration want to let banks get into new  
kinds of financial activities through subsidiaries of the banks 
themselves, not just through affiliated companies within the same 
parent holding company. That arrangement would increase the power 
of the Treasury's Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, 
regulator of nationally chartered banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan and most Republican lawmakers, on the other hand, want  
to let banks diversify through a holding company. That would expand 
the independent Federal Reserve's role as a regulator. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar financial overhaul bill recently cleared the House  
Banking Committee and is being reviewed by the House Commerce 
Committee, which has given it a lukewarm reception. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, aiming to protect consumers' privacy, the Senate  
overwhelmingly adopted a measure that would make it a federal crime 
for anyone to misrepresent himself to obtain someone's private 
financial data. The vote was 95-2. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure responded to Americans' growing concern over privacy  
in an era of consolidations creating huge financial institutions 
selling everything from checking accounts to mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The action on Gramm's proposal followed a request to Congress by  
President Clinton earlier this week to bolster consumers' financial 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans have become increasingly concerned about the issue''  
of privacy, said Sen. Paul Sarbanes of Maryland, the banking 
panel's senior Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer protection measure doesn't go nearly as far as many  
privacy advocates wish. 
</P>
<P>
	Edmund Mierzwinski, consumer program director for the U.S.  
Public Interest Research Group, called it ``a scam and a sham'' and 
a ``substitute for true privacy reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are extremely disappointed in the Senate for calling that  
privacy,'' said Mierzwinski. Among other things, he said, the 
lawmakers should have addressed the issue of affiliated financial 
companies sharing their customers' data with each other. For 
example, in some large financial concerns, insurance operations 
might share customer information with the company's brokerage unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Although almost all senators backed the privacy provision, the  
broader bill was the subject of extensive debate Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., called it ``exactly the wrong bill at  
exactly the wrong time. ... This is moving this country in the 
wrong direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Removing the Depression-era barriers separating banks, brokerage  
firms and insurers would increase the likelihood of future taxpayer 
bailouts of big institutions that fail, Dorgan warned. 
</P>
<P>
	``This orgy of big bank mergers in our country moves now at an  
accelerated pace, unabated.'' he said. He cited recent 
consolidations including those in which banking giant Citicorp 
merged with brokerage-insurer Travelers Group in a deal valued at 
$36.9 billion, NationsBank Corp. and BankAmerica Corp. combined in 
a $41.5 billion marriage, and Banc One Corp. and First Chicago NBD 
Corp. united in a $18.7 billion deal. 
</P>
<P>
	In a setback for the administration Wednesday, the Senate  
defeated, 52-45, an amendment that would have removed the 
provisions related to the community lending law that are opposed by 
the administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill exempts small rural banks from the community-lending  
law and makes it harder for the government to use satisfactory 
community-lending ratings as a requirement for banks being allowed 
to expand.

<HEADLINE> Pornography Prosecutions Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Stepping up prosecutions of  
pornography-related offenses could reduce crime, say lawmakers and 
anti-pornography activists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Research has shown that pornography contributes to sexual  
assault, including rape and molestation of children,'' Rep. Joe 
Pitts, R-Pa., said Wednesday at a news conference called to observe 
May as Victims of Pornography Month. 
</P>
<P>
	A study of child molesters revealed that 87 percent of those who  
molested girls and 77 percent of those who molested boys admitted 
using hard-core pornography regularly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The laws are already in place,'' said Rep. John Hostettler,  
R-Ind. ``We need the Justice Department to enforce the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gene McConnell, who lives in Cincinnati, said he started looking  
at pornography at age 12. Although he wasn't proud of it, he didn't 
think he was hurting anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	But he gradually became obsessed with it, he told reporters. And  
he thinks that played a role in his impulsive decision to jump into 
a woman's car and try to rape her years later. 
</P>
<P>
	McConnell, now vice president of victim assistance for the  
National Coalition for the Protection of Children &AMP; Families, said 
he broke away from pornography for a while at age 16 after becoming 
overwhelmed with shame for having molested a 14-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
	But he returned to it years later after he began having trouble  
in his marriage. Soon afterwards, he began frequenting strip clubs 
and massage parlors and paying prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 17 years ago, he forced his way into the woman's car  
and grabbed her by the throat. But then he realized he was about to 
damage another person's life. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fear in her eyes was like being hit with a baseball bat,''  
McConnell said. ``I said, `I'm sorry, I've made a serious mistake,' 
got out of the car and walked away.'' The woman wrote down his 
license plate number and turned him in to police, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard thousands of stories from men ... who have similar  
stories to my own,'' he said. ``They may not have taken it to the 
extent that I did, but pornography played a significant role in 
their dysfunctional relationships.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Removes Trustee From Trust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- A judge has removed from a wealthy trust one of  
the five trustees who was accused of mismanagement and abuse of 
power while overseeing a school for Hawaiian children. 
</P>
<P>
	The ouster of trustee Lokelani Lindsey on Thursday could mark  
the first step toward the complete dismantling of the 
once-untouchable board for the Bishop Estate trust. 
</P>
<P>
	Another state court hearing was scheduled for today concerning  
the fates of all the trustees. The Internal Revenue Service has 
threatened to cancel the estate's nonprofit status if the trustees 
do not resign. 
</P>
<P>
	The trust, created by the 1884 will of Princess Bernice Pauahi  
Bishop to educate ``the children of Hawaii,'' has assets valued at 
up to $10 billion and is the state's largest private landowner. 
</P>
<P>
	The trustees are paid commissions based on the estate's  
investment performance. They now earn more than $1 million each. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Circuit Court Judge Bambi Weil granted a request by  
two other trustees to remove Lindsey. She had no immediate comment 
and her attorney said he would appeal the ouster. 
</P>
<P>
	``The standards to remove a trustee are very high and certainly,  
in our view, the other side never came close to meeting that 
standard,'' attorney David Gierlach said. ``This case is not going 
to go away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lindsey was appointed in 1993 to oversee the Kamehameha Schools,  
the estate's sole beneficiary. But she relinquished that authority 
in December 1997 after coming under fire for releasing her own 
report criticizing the test scores of Kamehameha's 3,100 students 
of Hawaiian ancestry. 
</P>
<P>
	That same month, trustees Oswald Stender and Gerard Jervis  
accused Lindsey of being unfit to sit on the board of trustees. 
They claimed she misused trust resources, abused her power and 
mismanaged the schools.

<HEADLINE> Dell Opening Nashville Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Dell Computer Corp. plans to construct a  
plant and an office building near Nashville International Airport 
which could bring 3,000 new jobs to the area within the next five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell will open a temporary plant in nearby Lebanon in August and  
start making Dimension computers while the permanent plant is under 
construction, vice chairman Kevin Rollins said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell will have a technical support office in Nashville by  
mid-September and employ 1,000 workers before the end of the year, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to comment on speculation the job tally eventually  
could reach 10,000, except to say ``there's plenty of room to 
grow'' on the 700-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at our trajectory and the growth rates of our  
business, you can see we are going to need a lot of people and a 
lot of help,'' Rollins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell was created 15 years ago by Michael Dell in a University of  
Texas-Austin dorm room. It is now the world's No. 3 computer 
manufacturer, reporting profits last year of $1.5 billion and sales 
of $18.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell employs 24,000 people in 33 countries, including 17,000 at  
its headquarters in Round Rock, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell's Nashville campus, its first U.S. operation outside Texas,  
will house a 300,000-square-foot plant and a 250,000-square-foot 
office building. Most of the jobs will be for factory, customer 
service and technical work, with salaries ranging from $24,400 for 
entry-level workers to $45,000 for middle managers.

<HEADLINE> Do Video Games Trigger Violence? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Duke Nukem slips into a burger joint,  
shotgun at the ready. Suddenly, from behind a table, out lurches a 
hulking beast with the fanged face of a warthog, LAPD scrawled 
across his jacket. 
</P>
<P>
	With a quick move, Duke's shotgun is triggered once, twice, then  
again. The porcine foe crumples to the floor, oozing cartoon blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Video games like ``Duke Nukem'' and ``Doom'' have  
``first-person'' or ``corridor'' shooters, with the player 
controlling an unseen character. Instead, the muzzle of a gun pokes 
up from the bottom of the screen, leading the way through streets 
and buildings as the player, in constant danger, tries to shoot 
everything that moves. 
</P>
<P>
	Rarely are the opponents human. Most are bizarre creatures, the  
stuff of nightmares -- flaming disembodied heads, giant beasts with 
slavering jaws. They are obviously evil and deserve to die. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think they're really dangerous,'' said Bryan Siepert,  
17, a fan of the games and a junior at San Francisco's Lowell High 
School. ``I've never felt the urge to go out and shoot someone 
because I've been playing `Quake' for an hour or so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in the wake of the Columbine High School massacre, questions  
are being raised about whether the fantasy games contribute to 
real-life violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a brutalizing experience,'' said George Gerbner, a  
telecommunications professor at Temple University. ``The result of 
exposure is not imitation, but a sense of normality, an acceptance 
of brutality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Littleton, Colo., case, two teen-agers, Eric Harris and  
Dylan Klebold, killed themselves April 20 after shooting to death a 
dozen classmates and a teacher. Harris was a devotee of an online 
version of ``Doom,'' and Klebold also played. 
</P>
<P>
	The games are relatively cheap, tumbling from $50 as each new  
issue hits the market. At some stores, older ``Doom'' and ``Duke 
Nukem'' games sell for $10 to $15. 
</P>
<P>
	While millions of copies have been sold, violence like what  
happened in Littleton is rare. But some experts feel the games have 
a negative effect -- and they want something done. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Vice President Gore announced that Internet  
companies have agreed to give parents new tools to restrict and 
monitor online material. And video games are sure to be discussed 
at President Clinton's strategy session on school violence. He's 
invited clergy and gun makers, and leaders from government, the 
entertainment and Internet industries to Monday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody has any evidence proving any correlation between  
violent images and violent behavior,'' contended Aaron John Loeb, 
editor of Next Generation Online, the Internet edition of a monthly 
magazine dedicated to video games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it has much correlation,'' agreed Justin Chuan,  
an 18-year-old student at Gallileo Academy of Science and 
Technology, a public high school in San Francisco. ``It's more 
about neglect and being an outcast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But David Grossman, a retired Army lieutenant colonel who heads  
the Arkansas-based Killology Research Group, said the games are 
sophisticated simulators, similar to those used in military 
training. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's learning to kill and learning to like it,'' said  
Grossman, who testified on the subject Tuesday before the Senate 
Commerce Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why does a child need that device?'' he asked. ``They don't.  
Society helps parents with such things as a child's access to 
tobacco, guns, drugs, alcohol. We have laws that say anybody who 
gives your kids this stuff is a criminal. Why on this one subject 
do we say, ``You're on your own?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Grossman said children should be barred from violent games until  
at least the age of 13, and he thinks 18 is about right for games 
which use simulated weapons instead of handheld controllers. 
</P>
<P>
	But such claims are based more on popular wisdom than any  
scientific evidence, said Jeanne Funk, a clinical psychiatry 
professor at the University of Toledo in Ohio who has published 
articles on the impact of video games on children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scientifically, we don't have a lot of studies at this point  
on the subject,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The most recent studies, done in the 1980s, indicate that  
children playing violent games seemed more aggressive right after 
playing than those playing more benign games. But for violence on a 
Littleton scale, ``it takes, I believe, a child who is already 
troubled,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very concerned about First Amendment issues,'' she added.  
``I'm not a supporter of violent video games, but we need to go 
about this carefully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Loeb, the magazine editor, said the games are being made a  
scapegoat. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have had a very strong reaction to what's happened and  
they want somebody to blame,'' said Loeb. ``You can understand 
their motive -- but the people who are to blame are Eric Harris and 
Dylan Klebold.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Dip; Dow Falls 8.59 Points / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices fluctuated Thursday but ended lower  
as cautionary remarks by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan 
fed investors' increasing worries about inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 8.59 at 10,946.82.  
The Dow fell as much as 103 points during the day, then tried but 
failed to recover ground just before the close. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader market indicators also were mostly lower. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was down 15.26 at 1,332.05, and the Nasdaq 
composite index was down 62.16 at 2,472.28. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors are increasingly concerned that the robust economy  
will reawaken inflation and prompt the Fed to push rates higher 
when its policy writers meet in two weeks. Higher rates are the 
market's nemesis because they can quickly eat into corporate 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	In remarks to bankers in Chicago, Greenspan praised the  
performance of the U.S. economy in recent years, but warned that 
gains in productivity cannot keep inflation at bay forever. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I have said on previous occasions, there are imbalances in  
our expansion that, unless redressed, will bring this long run of 
strong growth and low inflation to a close,'' he said. He said 
tight labor markets, for example, could ultimately threaten the 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	As he has in the past, Greenspan also expressed concern that the  
high-flying stock market could suddenly come back to earth, causing 
a reversal of the wealth effect that has powered consumer spending 
</P>
<P>
	His morning speech caused already jittery stock and bond markets  
to fall throughout the day. The Treasury's 30-year bond carried a 
yield of 5.78 percent, its highest level since June. The bond had 
closed late Wednesday with a yield of 5.70 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hawkish tone from Greenspan is shaking the trees of growth  
stocks and, as a result, continuing to put downward pressure on 
growth and financial stocks,'' said Tom Galvin, chief equity 
strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial services stocks were particularly hard hit by the  
interest rate worries. The discount broker Schwab Corp. fell 4 1/8 to 
103 3/8, while Chase Manhattan was down 2 5/8 to 77 9/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail stocks also felt the pinch, despite the announcement  
Thursday that many big storeowners had better-than-expected sales 
in April. Gap Inc. fell 5 1/4 to 64 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T rose 5 to 61 15/16 after announcing that Microsoft will  
invest $5 billion in the telecommunications company. In return, 
AT&AMP;T said it will increase its use of Microsoft's software. 
Microsoft fell 1 3/16 to 77 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, AT&AMP;T negotiated its victory in a bidding war with  
Comcast over MediaOne Group Inc., the nation's fourth-largest cable 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Internet stocks fell Thursday, perhaps at the threat from  
the Microsoft-AT&AMP;T communications alliance. Intel fell 4 5/16 to 59 
11/16, while Amazon.com slipped 9 1/8 to 137 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancers outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the New  
York Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume came to 1.056 
billion shares, down from Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 4.32 at 636.22, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was up 2.32 at 787.81. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index, which reflects the performance of  
smaller-company stocks, fell 0.89 at 433.38. 
</P>
<P>
	European stocks were little changed. The CAC 40 in Paris ended  
0.79 percent lower, London's FTSE 100 index closed down 0.07 
percent, and the DAX in Frankfurt dropped 0.61 percent. In Tokyo, 
the Nikkei rose 3.58 percent.

<HEADLINE> Dickerson Shooting Hot for Rockets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- While the Big Three of Charles Barkley, Hakeem  
Olajuwon and Scottie Pipen have contributed their share, the 
Houston Rockets have been energized by the sizzling shooting of 
rookie guard Michael Dickerson. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickerson hit 58 combined points in the final two regular-season  
games, benefiting from the Rockets recent decision to open up their 
running game and they'll need it beginning Sunday in Game 1 of a 
best-of-5, first-round playoff series with the Los Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael got the quietest 58 points over the last two nights,''  
coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``That kid's potential is unlimited 
and it happened just at the right time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dickerson hit a career-high 31 against Minnesota and closed with  
27 against Denver. He hit 11-of-14 3-point shots over the final two 
games and ranks No. 6 in the NBA in 3-point accuracy. In those two 
games he was 21-for-34 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``We finally realized that we had the capabilities to run,''  
Dickerson said. ``We've been able to get some easy points on the 
transition. It's really easier because you are warm from running 
and you get in a rhythm. You don't have to set up on the perimeter 
and wait to get a shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Barkley has been pushing for more emphasis on the  
running game with Dickerson and the Rockets' other rookie starting 
guard, Cuttino Mobley. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to utilize the young legs of Michael and Cuttino,''  
Barkley said. ``The Rockets can't play like they did five years 
ago. Hakeem can't do it all by himself now. We haven't utilized 
Michael or Scottie well this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went to Scottie and told him if we don't win the  
championship they're going to blame us so let's go out playing the 
way we want,'' Barkley said. 
</P>
<P>
	It might be that the Rockets are just now blending their talents  
to the point that the transition game will work. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys are running more. That's what we've been trying to  
get done all season,'' Tomjanovich said. ``We're pushing and trying 
to create something and that will continue. I'm glad those guys 
made a commitment to it. It's just going to get better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen struggled to get into the flow of the offense much of the  
season but he's adapted to the running. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been into the up-tempo game and that's something I'd  
been hoping to put in earlier in the season,'' Pippen said. ``I 
think it's easier for us on offense. It allows the guys to get open 
looks instead of having the big guys pound it inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dickerson started getting the ball in his hands more as the  
regular season wound down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't been shooting like I'm capable of shooting,''  
Dickerson said. ``I think I lost my confidence for a while but 
Eddie (Johnson) told me if I missed five shots in a row or if I 
missed eight to come back and shoot the next shot with 
confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dickerson took the veteran's advice, although he didn't miss  
much after that conversation. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickerson's season average is 10.2 points per game in his first  
season with the Rockets. He was a career 13.8 scorer at Arizona and 
was the Wildcats' leading scorer his junior and senior seasons at 
18.9 and 18.0 per game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really starting to feel comfortable out there,'' Dickerson  
said. ``I just don't know if I'm this is the real me scoring all 
these points.''

<HEADLINE> April, Year-to-Date Retail Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	April sales and sales for the fiscal year to date reported by  
leading retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	The sales compare the current year's sales with those of the  
previous year. Retailers are ranked according to results at the end 
of April. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporting periods vary slightly. Most retailers' fiscal years  
end in late January or early February.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Fall; Dow Down 96.50 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices fell today as investors, reacting  
to more signs of a robust economy, grew increasingly concerned 
about interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 96.50 at 10,858.91. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was down 20.85 at 1,326.46, and the Nasdaq 
composite index was down 44.24 at 2,490.21. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors are increasingly worried that the strong economy will  
reawaken inflation and prompt the Federal Reserve to push rates 
higher. They were especially anxious today to see whether April 
employment figures, to be released Friday, will signal increased 
inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	Remarks by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan didn't help  
the markets much. Although he praised the performance of the U.S. 
economy in recent years, he warned that gains in productivity 
cannot keep inflation at bay forever. 
</P>
<P>
	He warned that the nation's longest peacetime expansion will be  
threatened at some point down the road by the tight labor markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is falling because the few people that are playing  
right now are looking at the risks of higher interest rates,'' said 
Charles White, portfolio manager at Avatar Associates in New York. 
``On the margin, there's a little bit of profit-taking going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Financial services stocks were particularly hard hit by the  
nervousness over interest rates. The discount broker Schwab Corp. 
was down 6 1/8 at 101 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	A jump in bond market yields only added to the uncertainty. The  
Treasury's 30-year bond carried a yield of 5.77 percent, up sharply 
from late Wednesday's 5.70 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of the strong economy, many big retailers reported  
their sales soared to better-than-expected levels in April. But 
their stocks were mostly lower, with Wal-Mart falling 2 15/16 to 
42 1/8 and Dayton Hudson slipping 2 5/16 to 62 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a margin of nearly 4  
to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 591.1 
million shares, down from Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 7.53 at 633.01, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was up 4.15 at 789.64.

<HEADLINE> Jefferson Reunion Adds Slave's Kin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- Guess who's coming to dinner at the  
Thomas Jefferson family reunion this year? 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, descendants of Jefferson's slave Sally  
Hemings will attend the annual gathering, which has been held at 
Monticello for the past 86 years. But a battle looms over whether 
the Hemingses will be fully accepted as Jefferson's kin. 
</P>
<P>
	The reunion will be the first one held since DNA test results  
last fall found that the author of the Declaration of Independence 
may have fathered at least one of Hemings' children. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of those findings, a white, sixth-generation scion of  
Jefferson plans to challenge his cousins to formally admit the 
Hemings descendants into their family organization, the Monticello 
Association, during their private meeting May 16. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see what the big deal is unless the big deal is  
racism,'' said Lucian K. Truscott IV, a best-selling author and 
member of the Monticello Association. ``They take my word that I'm 
a descendant and they don't take their word, despite the oral 
histories and DNA tests that back their claim. That's racist on its 
face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, it looks racist, but it's a genealogical question,''  
Monticello Association President Robert Gillespie countered. 
``We've got historical records. We need to go over some gaps in 
their genealogy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not ready to say yes, but we're definitely not saying  
no,'' said Gillespie, a lawyer from Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, Truscott urged Hemings descendants to crash the  
reunion. Then, last week, the Monticello Association sent the 
descendants invitations to the reunion dinner, which will be held 
at a historic tavern May 15, and a tour of Monticello, Jefferson's 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	Truscott said Thursday that 34 members of the Hemings family are  
coming. 
</P>
<P>
	``That really cracks open the door,'' Truscott said of the  
official invitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Truscott and some of the Hemings descendants said that a vote to  
unite Jefferson's presumed white and black descendants would help 
heal racial rifts in America. It was Jefferson who wrote that ``all 
men are created equal,'' yet he owned slaves and ignored 
accusations that he fathered a biracial child. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just our story -- it resonates for the whole  
country,'' said Dr. Michelle Cooley-Quille, a Hemings descendant 
and clinical psychologist at John Hopkins University who plans to 
attend the reunion. Her father was denied entry into the Monticello 
Association and denied burial at Monticello, a privilege accorded 
to all members, after he died last year. ``It's symbolic of what 
we've been denied but where we belong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 150 members of the Monticello Association are expected at  
the reunion, which is about normal attendance. Gillespie said a 
mail survey of all 700 members may be needed to decide whether to 
admit the Hemings kin into the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the DNA tests, the story of Jefferson and his slave had  
been passed down orally through the Hemings generations. Hemings 
was said to have become Jefferson's lover when he was ambassador to 
France in the late 1780s. In an interview in 1873, Madison Hemings 
claimed to be Jefferson's son. 
</P>
<P>
	William Dalton, a great-great-great-great-great-great-grandson  
of Madison Hemings, said he is coming to the reunion so the 
Jefferson family can see what he sees every time he looks in the 
mirror and every time he looks at Jefferson's profile on the 
nickel. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can see the mix in me,'' said Dalton, 34, of Columbus,  
Ohio. ``The way our bottom jaws stick out, the pouty bottom lip. 
I'd like them to see my face when they make their decision on 
letting any Hemingses in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dalton said he is not angry at Jefferson for owning slaves and  
not acknowledging his paternity because ``he was a product of his 
own society.'' But he said the founding father's descendants ought 
to know better. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here's a good chance to heal a multicolored family,'' Dalton  
said. ``If they accept us as family, they will show America we can 
get along and it's not about color.''

<HEADLINE> Coles Linked to Atlanta Olympic Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Australian Olympic official Phil Coles,  
a prominent figure in the Salt Lake City Games bribes scandal, also 
may have played a role in Atlanta's successful bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles was officially thanked for ``help and advice'' given to  
the Atlanta bid team before the IOC chose the city for the 1996 
Summer Games, a Sydney newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Coles was a member of the bid team for Atlanta's  
Australian rival, Melbourne. 
</P>
<P>
	Among documents released by Atlanta last week was a letter from  
the Atlanta Organizing Committee to Coles thanking him for making 
time to meet the team in Seoul in 1988, The Sydney Morning Herald 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``On behalf of Billy Payne, Charlie Battle and the rest of our  
Atlanta group, thanks again for your help and advice,'' Atlanta 
executive board member Horace Sibley wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Walker, a member of Melbourne's bid, said that the ``heat''  
Coles is feeling is justice for his ``dalliance with Atlanta.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a pity that so many of us spent so much time  
pursuing the games for 1996 for Melbourne and we find that one of 
our number chose to help the other side,'' Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
	His Melbourne critics previously cited telephone records which  
showed that Coles made 44 private calls to the Atlanta bid 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, one of two Australian IOC members, has resisted against  
calls he should resign from the Sydney Organizing Committee for the 
Olympic Games (SOCOG) for links to scandals that organizers say are 
seriously damaging sponsorship and threaten to hurt the pending 
ticket sales campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG chief executive Sandy Hollway said today that many  
existing games sponsors had been ``treading water'' while the 
controversies continued, but they now want ``the decks cleared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the person charged with bringing off the biggest peacetime  
event on earth, I'm trying to raise $160 million in additional 
sponsorships, I've got tickets going on sale at the end of this 
month, I've got volunteers around the country being recruited,'' 
Hollway told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't need day after day of front page and other news  
stories that are clouding what we should be thinking about, which 
is the sport, the athletes, the magnificence of this event for 
Sydney.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG has blamed the IOC votes-for-bribes scandal in part for a  
sponsorship shortfall of around $110 million. 
</P>
<P>
	David D'Alessandro, chief of major Olympics sponsor John  
Hancock, renewed calls for Coles to resign and said the IOC was 
allowing the Sydney games to be damaged by not bringing the crisis 
to an end. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apparently the IOC doesn't care ... they seem to say, this man  
is part of our inner circle, we stand with him and he stands for 
what we expect out of our IOC members and if you can't raise the 
money because of it, too bad,'' D'Allessandro told ABC radio. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC executive board, the organization's highest body, this  
week deferred a decision on allegations Coles accepted excessive 
gifts from someone associated with the 1996 Athens bid. New 
allegations surfaced Tuesday that dossiers on IOC members compiled 
by Coles for Sydney bidders were given to members of the bidding 
team for the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The board is expected to decide Coles's fate in mid-June.  
</P>
<P>
	Coles received the most severe reprimand short of expulsion from  
the IOC after its investigation into the votes-for-bribes scandal 
surrounding the Salt Lake bid found he accepted hospitality beyond 
IOC rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles claims there is a conspiracy against him and vowed not to  
quit. He has previously said some disenchanted members of 
Melbourne's failed 1996 bid might be plotting to bring him down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to walk away until I look my accusers in the  
face and say you were wrong,'' Coles told commercial TV. ``If I'm 
wrong, then I will have to go, but I'm not wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Herald also reported that Dick Ebersol, head of NBC Sports,  
one of the biggest underwriters of the games, added his voice to 
calls for Coles' resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He should certainly leave SOCOG,'' Ebersol was quoted as  
saying. ``This issue clearly slows sponsorship sales.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But senior IOC member Jacques Rogge said Coles should be able to  
defend himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``His rights as a defendant is to explain his defense. We'll  
make a judgment and I'll comment only after that,'' Rogge said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Atlanta, the group that initiated the city's bid for the 1996  
Olympics is suing to stop the state from forcing it to open 
thousands of additional boxes of records to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	The Georgia Amateur Athletic Foundation filed suit late  
Wednesday after receiving a letter from Georgia Attorney General 
Thurbert Baker, who threatened legal action if the files were not 
opened. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker's letter said the files should be made public because of  
the ``overwhelmingly public nature of the 1996 Olympics (and) the 
inextricable link between private interests and government entities 
in the pursuit'' of the games.

<HEADLINE> Litton Offering To Buy Shipbuilders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Litton Industries Inc. offered today to buy  
Newport News Shipbuilding and Avondale Industries in a package 
buyout valued at $1.76 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The unsolicited bid came less than a month after the Pentagon  
rejected General Dynamics' effort to acquire the Virginia company 
in a deal worth an estimated $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company would create an international shipbuilding  
giant with annual revenue of $7.4 billion and more than 58,000 
employees 
</P>
<P>
	Woodland Hills, Calif.-based Litton offered a tax-free,  
stock-for-stock deal for Newport News Shipbuilding. Each share of 
the Virginia company would be converted to .55 Litton shares. The 
value of the deal would be $1.26 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avondale offer is for $38 per share, or $503.6 million, in  
cash. The combined offer also includes another $600 million in 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``When combined with our highly efficient Ingalls Shipbuilding  
business, this triumvirate would create a world-class leader in 
shipbuilding,'' said Michael R. Brown, chairman and CEO of Litton. 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans-based Avondale and Newport News Shipbuilding already  
were preparing to merge when General Dynamics made its offer for 
the Virginia yard in February. 
</P>
<P>
	But on April 14, Defense Secretary William Cohen scuttled the  
General Dynamics proposal, saying any cost savings to taxpayers 
would not justify the loss of competition for designing and 
building Navy ships. 
</P>
<P>
	The Litton proposal is expected to require a Pentagon review as  
well. Brown said the company has had preliminary discussions with 
the Department of Defense about the offer, and claimed the 
acquisitions would enhance competition within the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	William P. Fricks, chairman and chief executive officer of  
Newport News Shipbuilding, said the company's board of directors 
agreed to ``preliminary discussions'' with Litton ``to fully 
evaluate the terms of the offer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to emphasize, however, that our board has not made any  
determination as to the adequacy of Litton's present proposal, and 
there can be no assurance that any transaction proposed by Litton 
will be acceptable to our board,'' Fricks said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert L. Bossier Jr., chairman and CEO of Avondale, said the  
company had Litton's offer under review and would comment further 
when the review is complete. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Rear Adm. Eugene Carroll, deputy director of the  
Washington-based Center for Defense Information, a Pentagon 
watchdog group, said the Litton proposal is another indication of 
consolidation pressures in the defense industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``The drive in the whole military complex is for consolidation  
and so-called economies of scale, where they cut costs and overhead 
-- in theory, to the advantage of the Department of Defense,'' 
Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
	Litton controls a number of aerospace, defense and electronics  
businesses, including Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Miss., a 
builder of Navy destroyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport News Shipbuilding, where the Steelworkers union has been  
on strike since April 5 over wages and other benefits, is the only 
builder of Navy aircraft carriers and shares submarine work with 
General Dynamics' Electric Boat division in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	Avondale designs, builds and overhauls Navy surface ships as  
well as commercial vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	The Litton offer was disclosed after the stock market closed  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Newport News Shipbuilding rose 12 1/2 cents to $27 in  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while shares of Avondale 
fell 75 cents to $31.37 1/2 in trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
Shares of Litton rose 18 3/4 cents to $64.75 on the NYSE.

<HEADLINE> The Derby Is the Derby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Once again, there's a hue and cry about reducing the Kentucky  
Derby to 14 starters from the present 20-horse limit. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been written that as many as nine of 19 starters in the  
125th Derby didn't get a fair shot at winning. 
</P>
<P>
	The loudest complaints, however, seemed to come from  
professional handicappers, who want to brag about picking the Derby 
winner. There also have been some yelps from losing trainers. 
</P>
<P>
	How the big bettors feel about big Derby fields is not known,  
but it can be assumed that if they feel the situation is not 
favorable, they lay off. 
</P>
<P>
	As for most of the people who show up at Churchill Downs on the  
first Saturday in May (151,051 this year), and for those who play 
office pools and attend parties, the size of the field is not 
important, nor is picking the right horse. Many of them, for 
various reasons, don't even get a glimpse of the wrong horse. 
</P>
<P>
	The manager of a bar-restaurant in midtown New York City drew  
Charismatic in a pool. So he sent a bartender to a nearby off-track 
betting parlor to wager $20 on the colt, whose on-track payoff of 
$64.60 was the third largest in Derby history. 
</P>
<P>
	To many people, the Derby is much more than a horse race. It's  
an event. 
</P>
<P>
	Do only motor racing fans follow the Indy 500? Are parties a big  
reason to watch the Super Bowl? 
</P>
<P>
	So it was with Kentucky Derby CXXV.  
</P>
<P>
	``They call it a roller Derby. It's rough,'' trainer D. Wayne  
Lukas said. ``But that's what makes it unique.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas, of course, was the winning trainer on Saturday for the  
fourth time, but he's also been in 15 other Derbies in which he 
lost and in which the smallest fields were 13 twice and the largest 
were 20 twice and 21 once. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about reducing the size of the field, trainer Nick Zito  
said you shouldn't narrow the dream of running in and winning the 
Derby. Zito, who has won two Derbies, finished 14th with Stephen 
Got Even, the second betting favorite, and 17th with Adonis. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Elliott Walden, whose Menifee was beaten by a neck by  
Charismatic, after being far back and being checked by traffic on 
the final turn, said he thought about reducing the size of the 
field, but he also said, ``I might win it some day because another 
horse gets into trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One reason for this year's big field was that it was the 125th  
anniversary of America's Race. On the 100th anniversary, there were 
23 starters. There were 21 starters in 1981, after litigation. 
Since then, however, the 20-limit rule has been made court-proof. 
</P>
<P>
	Safety, of course, is a concern, but while the Derby is often  
roughly run, it seems the rough tactics aren't necessarily a result 
of rough riding. After, all, jockeys have to be aware of the 
consequences of a spill. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the problems Saturday was that the filly Three Ring (post  
No. 2), who was expected to get out and set the pace, allowing the 
field to string out a bit, was bumped at the start and then had her 
saddle slip. No rider on any other starter was especially anxious 
to take the lead, and so the field reached the first turn almost as 
one. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps a certain number of front runners should be required.  
Just kidding. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the Derby. Let it alone, unless the risks can be proven to  
be unacceptable. And reducing risk doesn't seem to be a main reason 
behind the calls for change.

<HEADLINE> Seagram Loses $199M in 3rd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Seagram Co., the media and liquor company, lost  
$199 million in its third quarter as more disappointments at the 
box office wiped out profits in other divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The company blamed the loss on several poorly performing movies,  
incluing ``EdTV'' and ``Virus.'' Another poor set of movie releases 
in the quarter before that also resulted in lower revenues from 
home video rentals, which kick in several months after theater 
releases. 
</P>
<P>
	The $199 million net loss, which translated to 50 cents per  
share, compared to net profits of $461 million, or $1.32 per share, 
in the same period a year ago. The 1998 results were boosted by a 
one-time $433 million gain on the sale of Time Warner stock and a 
one-time $360 million gain from selling TV properties. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss was not as wide as the 54 cents per share estimated by  
Wall Street analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. Seagram shares 
rose 81 1/4 cents or 1.4 percent to $59.75 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's operating loss, which does not reflect one-time  
gains or charges, came to $163 million, compared with operating 
income of $47 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Not counting the effect of those one-time gains and other  
non-operating factors, the company's cash flow -- a commonly used 
measure for media companies -- declined 20 percent to $135 million 
in the three months ending in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite several hit movies such as ``Shakespeare in Love,'' the  
overall bad box office showing was the latest sign of trouble at 
Seagram's Universal Pictures, which shook up its top management 
late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagram president and CEO Edgar Bronfman, Jr. said the company  
expects its film operations to post another loss in the next 
quarter, ``and it will be several quarters before our film business 
returns to profitability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other parts of Seagram's operations did well. Cash flow at its  
music business jumped 25 percent as Universal Music Group artists 
garnered 27 Grammy awards. UMG became the world's largest music 
company after acquiring PolyGram last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagram's liquor business, which now makes up about a third of  
the company's revenues, also posted a 25 percent gain in earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Net revenues for the quarter jumped to $3.22 billion from $1.99  
billion. The increase was largely due to the addition of PolyGram. 
If PolyGram had been included in the results a year ago, the 
company would have had revenues of $2.99 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Seagram earned  
$739 million, or $2 per share, a rise of 19 percent compared to 
$622 million, or $1.76 per share in the same period a year ago. 
Revenues also rose 19 percent to $8.79 billion from $7.37 billion.

<HEADLINE> Financial Privacy Included in Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Aiming to protect consumers' privacy, the  
Senate on Thursday overwhelmingly adopted a measure that would make 
it a federal crime for anyone to misrepresent himself to obtain 
someone's private financial data. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 95-2 for the amendment to sweeping legislation the  
Senate is crafting that would let banks, securities firms and 
insurance companies get more deeply into each other's businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure responded to Americans' growing concern over privacy  
in an era of consolidations creating huge financial institutions 
selling everything from checking accounts to mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The action on the proposal of Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, chairman  
of the Senate Banking Committee, followed a request to Congress by 
President Clinton earlier this week to bolster consumers' financial 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans have become increasingly concerned about the issue''  
of privacy, said Sen. Paul Sarbanes of Maryland, the banking 
panel's senior Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm also rebuffed an effort by Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala.,  
and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., to steer the 
financial overhaul legislation toward the view of Treasury 
Secretary Robert Rubin and the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	An amendment proposed by Shelby and Daschle brought to the  
Senate floor a long-simmering debate between the administration and 
Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, supported by most Republicans, over 
the best bank corporate structure to allow in revamping the 
financial services laws. It was killed on a 53-46 vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate action increased the chances of a presidential veto.  
</P>
<P>
	The consumer protection measure doesn't go nearly as far as many  
privacy advocates wish. 
</P>
<P>
	Edmund Mierzwinski, consumer program director for the U.S.  
Public Interest Research Group, called it ``a scam and a sham'' and 
a ``substitute for true privacy reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are extremely disappointed in the Senate for calling that  
privacy,'' said Mierzwinski. Among other things, he said, the 
lawmakers should have addressed the issue of affiliated financial 
companies sharing their customers' data with each other. For 
example, in some large financial concerns, insurance operations 
might share customer information with the company's brokerage unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Although almost all senators backed the privacy provision, the  
broader bill was the subject of extensive debate Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., called it ``exactly the wrong bill at  
exactly the wrong time. ... This is moving this country in the 
wrong direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Removing the Depression-era barriers separating banks, brokerage  
firms and insurers would increase the likelihood of future taxpayer 
bailouts of big institutions that fail, Dorgan warned. 
</P>
<P>
	``This orgy of big bank mergers in our country moves now at an  
accelerated pace, unabated.'' he said. He cited recent 
consolidations including those in which banking giant Citicorp 
merged with brokerage-insurer Travelers Group in a deal valued at 
$36.9 billion, NationsBank Corp. and BankAmerica Corp. combined in 
a $41.5 billion marriage, and Banc One Corp. and First Chicago NBD 
Corp. united in a $18.7 billion deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Proponents of the financial overhaul legislation maintain it is  
needed to keep the U.S. financial industry competitive in global 
markets and that it would save consumers millions by providing 
one-stop financial shopping. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration supports such legislation in  
principle. But in a showdown with Gramm, it has threatened to veto 
the Senate bill unless there are major changes, notably the removal 
of provisions that Democrats view as an attack on the 1977 
Community Reinvestment Act. 
</P>
<P>
	In a setback for the administration Wednesday, the Senate  
defeated, 52-45, an amendment that would have removed the 
provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm wants to exempt small rural banks from the  
community-lending law and make it harder for the government to use 
satisfactory community-lending ratings as a requirement for banks 
being allowed to expand. 
</P>
<P>
	The privacy amendment takes aim at the practice of pretext  
calling, in which people call employees at banks and other 
businesses and use Social Security numbers to get information about 
bank accounts and other financial data. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Clinton urged Congress to bolster consumer's  
rights when banks and other financial companies seek to share or 
sell information about them. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's proposals include requiring banks and other financial  
institutions to tell consumers when they plan to share or sell 
their personal financial information, and giving consumers the 
power to stop such a transfer. He also wants to restrict any 
sharing of customers' medical information by affiliated companies 
within a financial conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Sens. Connie Mack of Florida and Don Nickles of  
Oklahoma voted against the financial privacy amendment. Freshman 
Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, R-Ill., is refraining from voting on the 
financial services legislation to avoid a conflict of interest: he 
owns a large stake in the Bank of Montreal, which previously bought 
his family's Illinois bank. He voted present.

	DENVER (AP) -- At the very least, the Colorado Avalanche were  
sending mixed signals. 
</P>
<P>
	On the one hand, coach Bob Hartley and several players insisted  
it was vital to avoid thuggery and unnecessary penalties in their 
second-round playoff series with the Detroit Red Wings, which opens 
here Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, the Avalanche added to their roster a pair of enforcer  
types, Scott Parker and Chris Dingman. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have some injuries with (Stephane) Yelle and (Valeri)  
Kamensky, and we wanted to have depth,'' Hartley said Thursday. ``I 
haven't decided how much they will play and in what situations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit coach Scotty Bowman, whose team is seeking a third  
straight Stanley Cup, said he was unaware of the roster moves until 
informed by the media. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first I've heard of it,'' Bowman said  
diplomatically. ``Teams recall players to get depth. With injuries, 
you've got to have enough players. We don't concern ourselves with 
what the other team does, because we have nothing to do about it, 
really.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chances are, neither Parker nor Dingman will see significant  
action. The Avalanche sounded sincere when talking about the 
importance of playing disciplined hockey throughout the series with 
their hated Western Conference rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a team is willing to throw a game away to prove that  
they're tougher than the other team, well, that's their choice,'' 
Hartley said. ``We're not going out there to run after people or to 
be stupid, and I'm fairly certain they're talking the same way in 
the other locker room. Neither team can afford to take stupid 
penalties. Neither team can let the game look like a circus. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to remember with the two-man referee system right  
now, that changes the entire game. This is a series where 
discipline will be a key factor. I don't think we can afford them 
going 5-on-3 against us, and it's the same thing for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Avs defenseman Aaron Miller agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``You can't take bad penalties in the playoffs,'' he said. ``You  
can't run around with your head cut off. You've got to be composed. 
I know there have been a lot of things that have happened in this 
series in the past, but it's very simple now: We've got to win four 
games. We're not worried about who has more hits at the end of the 
series. It's the four wins that matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we have to get run over and run through the glass to do it,  
we don't care. The more I get hit, the better. That means the less 
they are worried about our other players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Discipline hasn't been an appropriate word to describe recent  
games in this series, which is one of the bitterest rivalries in 
all of sports. 
</P>
<P>
	The nastiness began in the 1996 playoffs during Colorado's drive  
toward a Stanley Cup championship. Detroit's Slava Kozlov pushed 
Colorado's Adam Foote's face into the glass, causing a gash that 
needed 20 stitches to close. Then Colorado's Claude Lemieux 
sucker-punched Kozlov in retaliation, drawing a one-game 
suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux subsequently drew a two-game suspension for shoving Kris  
Draper into the boards, causing a facial injury that required 
plastic surgery to repair. 
</P>
<P>
	Avalanche goalie Patrick Roy had on-ice fights with Detroit  
goalie Mike Vernon in 1997 and with Chris Osgood in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In retaliation for the attack on Draper, Detroit's Darren  
McCarty pummeled Lemieux in a 1997 regular-season game. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, in their most recent meeting on March 14, Detroit's  
Kirk Maltby received a four-game suspension for breaking Kamensky's 
forearm with a slash. 
</P>
<P>
	Often obscured by the bad blood is the fact that  
Detroit-Colorado games tend to feature outstanding hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time Detroit plays Colorado, there is a very  
entertaining game,'' Red Wings center Steve Yzerman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Osgood is troubled by a knee injury and Bowman said Thursday his  
availability in goal would probably be a game-time decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's improved,'' Bowman said, ``but a goalie has to be 100  
percent to play. Right now, I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Osgood said he ``felt a lot better. I will come in (Friday) and  
go from there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Osgood can't play, Bill Ranford, who went 3-0-1 since being  
acquired from Tampa Bay on March 23, would replace him.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Players Return Home Day Late </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Normally it's no big deal if you oversleep and  
miss your plane. But this week such an incident caused a ruffling 
of diplomatic feathers in the United States and Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	When more than 300 Cubans, including an all-star baseball team,  
took off from Baltimore-Washington International Airport Tuesday 
morning, six of their compatriots missed the flight, allegedly 
because they overslept. 
</P>
<P>
	The six are now back in Cuba, having assured U.S. immigration  
agents on Wednesday that they were eager to go back and were not 
would-be defectors. They arrived 24 hours late and missed the 
celebration in Havana of the Cuban team's 12-6 triumph over the 
Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	What troubled the Cuban side was that the immigration officials  
interviewed the Cubans without first communicating with Cuban 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Luis Fernandez, spokesman for the Cuban diplomatic mission here,  
said he first learned of the interviews when a reporter called to 
ask about them hours after the Jamaica Air jet departed. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez, who was at BWI for the departure of the flight, said  
it would be a ``provocation'' for the interviews to have taken 
place without prior communication with Cuban officials. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Cuba would find it ``offensive'' if the six were asked  
whether they were leaving voluntarily. It was not clear, he added, 
whether Cuba would lodge a protest with the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., said in a telephone interview it was  
entirely appropriate that Cuban officials were not notified in 
advance. He noted that Cuba is on a list of countries alleged by 
the State Department to be sponsors of terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	Menendez said the six were interviewed on the jetway before they  
boarded. He said the Immigration and Naturalization Service should 
have found a site more neutral than one where Cuban security agents 
who escorted the group to the airport were nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	All six answered ``no'' to the following questions: Were they  
leaving involuntarily, were they fearful of returning to Cuba and 
was their return forced by coercion, Menendez said. He added that 
he was skeptical about the Cuban claim that the six overslept. 
</P>
<P>
	State and Justice Department officials accept the Cuban  
explanation. 
</P>
<P>
	They are also in agreement with Cuba on another issue: Both  
sides will work to facilitate communications between Rigoberto 
Herrera, the Cuban pitching coach who defected Tuesday morning, and 
his family back in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Herrera, 54, turned up at a Baltimore police station Tuesday  
morning and asked for political asylum. Officials said they expect 
the request to be granted.

<HEADLINE> Monk Charged With Coffin Vandalism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALMER, Mass. (AP) -- A monk has been charged with vandalism for  
scratching a cross on the coffin of a 17-year-old boy who died in 
his arms after being struck by a hit-and-run driver. 
</P>
<P>
	The abbot of the small monastic community, which draws its  
traditions from the Eastern Orthodox Church, called it a 
misunderstanding. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Christopher Martel's family said they were appalled  
at what they considered to be the desecration of the boy's casket 
just before it was lowered into his grave. The Martels are Roman 
Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't right,'' said Joshua Martel, 19, a brother. ``I  
don't know in his religion if it's bad or good, but I don't think 
it was right at all to carve on the casket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dell Scott Goodwin, 41, who goes by the name Father Lazarus,  
pleaded innocent Tuesday to vandalism and wanton destruction of 
property. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't do it to deface or offend at all,'' said William  
Saulnier, Goodwin's abbot. Saulnier said Goodwin also scratched 
``ICXC'' and ``NIKA'' -- Greek letters for ``Jesus Christ 
conquers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goodwin's lawyer, Gregory Hession, said that Goodwin had known  
Christopher Martel and was walking back to his monastery in 
Brimfield when he heard the car strike the boy nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	``The boy literally died in his arms,'' Hession said.  
</P>
<P>
	Goodwin waited until the family members were escorted to their  
vehicles following the graveside service and then used a stone and 
dirt to mark the casket, said Elaine Sansoucy, director of the 
funeral home. 
</P>
<P>
	``It all happened so fast,'' Sansoucy said. ``I yelled, `Stop!'  
and it was over.''

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stock Prices Surge / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Growing expectations that Japan may intensify  
efforts to repair its economy propelled the main Tokyo stock index 
3.59 percent higher today. The dollar rose against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.48 yen in late afternoon, up 0.90 yen from  
late last Friday in Tokyo but below its late New York level 
Wednesday of 120.65 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 599.08 points,  
or 3.59 percent, to 17,300.61 points -- its highest close since 
17,363.74 on Oct. 24, 1997. On Friday, the index lost 240.71 
points, or 1.42 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's rally came on the same day the Tokyo Stock Exchange  
began fully-computerized trading. The 120-year history of floor 
trading ended on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets in Japan were closed Monday through Wednesday  
for the nation's ``Golden Week'' holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said in Washington on Monday that he  
was determined to ensure a successful revitalization of the 
Japanese economy, which remains mired in its worst recession since 
World War II. Obuchi also held talks with U.S. President Bill 
Clinton at the White House on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are expecting more spending,'' said Tsuyoshi Nomaguchi,  
a strategist at Daiwa Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoshiro Mori, secretary-general of the ruling Liberal Democratic  
Party, has reportedly hinted at the need to increase public 
spending to boost growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must consider holding a session of parliament this autumn  
to handle substantial economic stimulus measures,'' Kyodo News 
service quoted Mori as saying on Monday. Mori is currently on a 
trip to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said buying from public funds also helped to lead the  
Tokyo market higher in the afternoon session. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 788  
million shares, up from Friday's turnover of 535 million shares. 
Advancing issues outnumbered retreaters 1,069 to 189, with 66 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 44.00 points, or 3.29 percent, to 1,381.12 
points. The TOPIX fell 10.52 points, or 0.78 percent, Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the dollar moved lower slightly from its level on  
Wednesday in New York on lingering expectation that any new 
economic stimulus steps from Japan could help boost its currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said, however, the dollar's losses were pared on  
short-covering after a spokesman for the prime minister expressed 
skepticism about reports on the new public spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Akitaka Saiki, spokesman for Prime Minister Obuchi told  
reporters that he was not sure if the news reports quoting Mori 
were accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 119.83 yen and 120.73 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 130.26 yen, up from  
126.86 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 212 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.330 percent from 1.420 percent late Friday, pushing 
its price up to 103.81 yen from 103.35 yen.

<HEADLINE> Nuggets Improve, but Disappoint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- With only one winning season in the '90s, maybe a  
change in scenery will help the Denver Nuggets change their 
misfortune. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nuggets rounded out a dismal decade with a 14-36 record in  
their final season in McNichols Arena, which will be torn down in 
favor of the $160 million Pepsi Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Denver improved its victory total in a lockout-shortened  
season, the Nuggets struggled to jell under first-year head coach 
Mike D'Antoni. They beat just three playoff-bound teams, never won 
more than two in a row and finished with seven straight losses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite frankly, I think we need a break,'' guard Chauncey  
Billups said. ``It was a long 90 days ... a long 90 days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The toll of playing four and sometimes five games a week was  
particularly difficult on the young Nuggets as they tried to find 
chemistry with several new players such as Billups, Nick Van Exel 
and Antonio McDyess. 
</P>
<P>
	Also hampering their progress was the loss of first-round draft  
pick Raef LaFrentz, who averaged 13.8 points and 7.6 rebounds in 12 
games before suffering season-ending knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Raef was healthy, we beat the Lakers and Utah at home,''  
forward Danny Fortson said. ``You need to have an extra big guy out 
there. Once he went down, it was hard to recover.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LaFrentz's absence forced the Nuggets to play the 6-foot-7  
Fortson in the middle, where he often gave up five inches to 
opposing centers. He responded gamely, however, finishing fourth in 
the NBA in rebounding with 11.6 boards per game. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's other main highlight was the successful return of  
McDyess, who spent a mediocre season in Phoenix before the Nuggets 
lured him back with a six-year, $67.5 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess, originally acquired by Denver in a draft-day trade in  
1995, averaged a career-best 21 points and 10.7 rebounds, but was 
clearly drained after fighting constant double teams while playing 
nearly 39 minutes a night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wears on your body and makes your legs tired,'' McDyess  
said. ``At the end, I didn't have any legs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finding someone to complement McDyess is one of several key  
issues for Denver in the offseason. Owner Bill Laurie, who bought 
the Nuggets last month, also must decide whether to bring back Van 
Exel and D'Antoni. 
</P>
<P>
	Laurie has remained noncommittal about D'Antoni, a coaching star  
in Italy before his move to the NBA. The players believe D'Antoni 
deserves at least one more season to prove himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a rookie coach taking over a team that had won 11  
games,'' Billups said. ``You've got to give the man a chance. 
Everybody in this locker room knows how good he is. We're all 
behind him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Van Exel, the petulant point guard is a free agent this  
summer but says his top priority is re-signing with the Nuggets. 
General manager Dan Issel has defended Van Exel against critics who 
say he is moody and has a shoot-first, pass-later mentality. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dan's pretty much told me that he would love to re-sign me, so  
he's given me all the confidence in the world,'' Van Exel said. ``I 
think I can really trust him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Exel, who stands to make more money by staying in Denver,  
also said he also feels obligated to McDyess after lobbying his 
friend to turn down more money in Phoenix and sign with the 
Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
	``After begging him to come here and telling him we would make  
the playoffs, it really didn't happen this year,'' Van Exel said. 
``To beg him to come here and then to just abandon him, I don't 
think that'd be being a friend.''

<HEADLINE> Bacteria-Control Gene Identified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers in California have shown that  
removing or inactivating a key gene can disarm bacteria and prevent 
it from starting an infection. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery, reported today in the journal Science, could lead  
to powerful new vaccines and antibiotics, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Michael J. Mahan of the University of California, Santa  
Barbara, leader of the team that made the discovery, said the work 
shows how salmonella bacteria, a major source of food poisoning in 
humans, causes illness. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've uncovered a genetic master switch that controls  
bacterial infection,'' said Mahan. ``When we knock out this switch, 
the bacterium is completely disabled in its ability to cause 
disease.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mahan said the DAM gene was found after a five-year process of  
examining bacterial genes that are turned on at the start of an 
infection in a host animal. Often these genes are quiet in 
laboratory dishes and go into action only when the pathogen is 
starting an infection inside an animal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bacterial pathogens act like a Trojan horse -- they hide their  
weapons until they are within an animal,'' said Mahan. As a result, 
some bacterial genes that cause infection ``are turned on inside a 
mouse and off outside a mouse,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The UCSB researchers found that the salmonella DAM gene makes a  
protein that activates other genes to start a biological cascade 
that leads to infection. 
</P>
<P>
	When strains of salmonella were created that contained a  
permanently disabled DAM gene, the microbe could not cause disease 
in mice. 
</P>
<P>
	The altered bacteria also acted like a vaccine, causing the  
mouse's immune system to make antibodies that would attack 
salmonella, said Mahan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mice immunized with this crippled strain of salmonella were  
completely protected from infection,'' he said. Some of the mice 
were injected with a salmonella dose 10,000 times more powerful 
than a dose that is lethal to half of all mice. None of the animals 
developed disease, said Mahan. 
</P>
<P>
	There are 2,500 strains of salmonella that cause diseases  
ranging from food poisoning to typhoid fever. Poorly cooked poultry 
and eggs are a common source of salmonella food poisoning, and some 
experts have estimated that up to 4 million Americans are affected 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
	A variety of other bacteria pathogens, including cholera, plague  
and Shigella dysentery, also have DAM genes, raising the 
possibility that those diseases could also be disabled by blocking 
DAM. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahan said it may be possible to make an antibiotic based on the  
DAM gene. If a chemical could be found that blocks the action of 
the protein made by DAM, then it might prevent bacteria from 
continuing the infection process, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a breakthrough discovery,'' said Dr. Philip Hanna, a  
microbiologist at Duke University Medical Center. ``They have found 
a master switch that turns on virulence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If further study proves that disabling the DAM genes will  
protect humans from bacterial infection, it could lead to a new 
class of antibiotics and to a new type of vaccine, Hanna said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dr. Regina Rabinovich, a scientist at the National Institute  
of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a part of the National 
Institutes of Health, cautioned that the value of the DAM research 
will not be known until it is tested and proven to work in humans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mouse has not been a very good model for what will happen  
with salmonella in humans,'' said Rabinovich. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical researchers are scrambling to find new ways of combating  
infections that now claim about 17 million lives annually worldwide 
-- almost three times the death toll of cancer. Many antibiotics 
that once worked are no longer effective against evolving strains 
of bacteria. Even vancomycin, the ``last hope'' antibiotic that 
once was invariably effective, has recently encountered germs it 
cannot control. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are about to reenter the pre-antibiotic era because there  
are pathogen strains now that are resistant to every available 
antibiotic,'' said Mahan. ``This (altering the DAM gene) may buy us 
some time.''

<HEADLINE> Seagram Loses $199M in 3rd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Seagram Co., the media and liquor company, lost  
$199 million in its third quarter as more disappointments at the 
box office wiped out profits in other divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The company blamed the loss on several poorly performing movies,  
incluing ``EdTV'' and ``Virus.'' Another poor set of movie releases 
in the quarter before that also resulted in lower revenues from 
home video rentals, which kick in several months after theater 
releases. 
</P>
<P>
	The $199 million net loss, which translated to 50 cents per  
share, compared to net profits of $461 million, or $1.32 per share, 
in the same period a year ago. The 1998 results were boosted by a 
one-time $433 million gain on the sale of Time Warner stock and a 
one-time $360 million gain from selling TV properties. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss was not as wide as the 54 cents per share estimated by  
Wall Street analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. Seagram shares 
rose 81 1/4 cents or 1.4 percent to $59.75 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's operating loss, which does not reflect one-time  
gains or charges, came to $163 million, compared with operating 
income of $47 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Not counting the effect of those one-time gains and other  
non-operating factors, the company's cash flow -- a commonly used 
measure for media companies -- declined 20 percent to $135 million 
in the three months ending in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite several hit movies such as ``Shakespeare in Love,'' the  
overall bad box office showing was the latest sign of trouble at 
Seagram's Universal Pictures, which shook up its top management 
late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagram president and CEO Edgar Bronfman, Jr. said the company  
expects its film operations to post another loss in the next 
quarter, ``and it will be several quarters before our film business 
returns to profitability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other parts of Seagram's operations did well. Cash flow at its  
music business jumped 25 percent as Universal Music Group artists 
garnered 27 Grammy awards. UMG became the world's largest music 
company after acquiring PolyGram last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagram's liquor business, which now makes up about a third of  
the company's revenues, also posted a 25 percent gain in earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Net revenues for the quarter jumped to $3.22 billion from $1.99  
billion. The increase was largely due to the addition of PolyGram. 
If PolyGram had been included in the results a year ago, the 
company would have had revenues of $2.99 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Seagram earned  
$739 million, or $2 per share, a rise of 19 percent compared to 
$622 million, or $1.76 per share in the same period a year ago. 
Revenues also rose 19 percent to $8.79 billion from $7.37 billion.

<HEADLINE> Most Oklahomans Don't Have Cellars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- You know the image -- the tornado comes and  
Midwesterners head for the root cellar, closing the door over their 
heads and safely riding out the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	In real life, most of the people in the path of the killer  
twisters that swept through ``Tornado Alley'' this week didn't even 
have a basement to hide in. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's deadly tornadoes hit Oklahoma City the hardest, killing  
at least 38. Others died in Kansas, Texas and Tennessee, making 
this the nation's deadliest tornado outbreak since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	For many parts of Tornado Alley, which stretches from north  
Texas to the Dakotas, safe cellars are from days gone by. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 23 years of building, I've only done one,'' said Tom  
Vorderlandwehr, an Oklahoma City-area home builder. ``It's not 
something that's typical to the area any more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many say the reasons are simple: soil conditions and cost.  
</P>
<P>
	In Oklahoma City much of the soil is red clay, which expands  
when wet and contracts when it dries. Because of the clay, a 
builder constructing a basement must remove twice as much dirt as 
normal and surround the home's concrete walls with more stable 
material. A finished basement can add $30,000 to $40,000 to a 
home's cost, builder Mark Dale said. 
</P>
<P>
	In northern Texas, the soil is a black ``gumbo'' with a wildly  
fluctuating moisture content. Most homes are built above ground, 
either on pier-and-beam foundations or concrete slabs. Storm 
cellars, few and far between, were found in older, rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kansas, the stable soil means most homes have basements.  
Wichita home builder Quentin Moeder said he never builds a home 
without one. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis George said that even in Oklahoma City's red clay, he can  
dig a cellar for as little as $20 a square foot, though it won't be 
pretty. ``Actually, a basement's about as cheap as putting a garage 
on,'' said George, who runs a backhoe service and builds homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Despain, a home builder and director of the Oklahoma City  
Board of Realtors, said that complacency, not cost, is the issue. 
Oklahoma City has been lulled into a false sense of security, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You see, we haven't had very many of these massive storms that  
just swipe everything away,'' Despain said. ``People think they can 
just get in a closet and be safe, and we found out last night that 
you can't. When we have a storm like last night, you've just got to 
be underground to be safe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His office manager was left in critical condition after she was  
swept from the bathtub where she was hiding under a mattress and 
was thrown two blocks. Several of the dead from Monday's storms 
were found huddled in bathtubs or under heavy furniture -- the 
places experts say you should go if you don't have a basement. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale said he's installing a lot of storm rooms above ground  
inside new homes, using concrete walls with a steel-reinforced 
ceiling. Texas Tech University in Lubbock has a research center 
looking to make buildings more storm resistant and provides plans 
for reinforcing a bathroom to make it a stronger shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes an extraordinary event like Monday's tornado --  
classified F5, the most powerful -- to change people's habits, 
Despain said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm kind of guessing that if today we advertised basements  
that we'd be busy for the next year building them,'' he said. ``I 
think I'm going to build me one after last night.''

<HEADLINE> Northwest Flight Attendants Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAGAN, Minn. (AP) -- After going nearly three years without a new  
contract, the union representing flight attendants at Northwest 
Airlines is mailing strike authorization ballots to members. 
</P>
<P>
	Lack of movement on pension issues in the latest round of talks  
forced the union to seek rank-and-file authorization to order a 
strike against the nation's fourth-largest airline, said Teamsters 
Local 2000 President Billie Davenport. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's just no movement on their part on the pension issue,  
which is our members' number one issue,'' Davenport said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballots will be mailed next week to the union's 11,000 members.  
The flight attendants will vote during a 30-day period. 
</P>
<P>
	No strike could take place at Northwest unless the National  
Mediation Board declares an impasse in the contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight attendants would then be barred from striking for 30 days  
and the sides could continue to negotiate during the cooling-off 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest round of talks ended Monday. They are scheduled to  
resume in early June. 
</P>
<P>
	If talks aren't productive, Davenport believes mediator Maggie  
Jacobsen will ask the National Mediation Board to release the sides 
from negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest spokesman Jon Austin had no comment on the flight  
attendants' move to distribute strike ballots. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest flight attendants with 30 years experience receive  
$1,000 a month in retirement benefits, far below other major 
airlines deals, Davenport said.

<HEADLINE> Senators Mull $4.3 Bil. in Farm Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators anxious to help farmers through their  
financial crisis are weighing whether to add $4.3 billion in 
emergency aid to a supplemental package moving through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers said after an hour-long meeting Wednesday that while  
there is consensus that action is needed to deal with the low 
prices plaguing the farm economy, there are concerns about putting 
additional money in a supplemental spending bill that has already 
been delayed for several months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something has got to be done this year,'' said Sen. Charles  
Grassley, R-Iowa, one of 14 senators who met privately for more 
than an hour. ``I think there is a consensus on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is timing and how much,'' said Sen. Larry Craig,  
R-Idaho. ``The feeling is this could be bad timing unless this is 
the only train leaving the station.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., ``This may be the only bite at  
the apple. There may only be one supplemental this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The money, if the group is successful, would be included with  
$152 million for farm loans already moving through Congress. That 
money is attached to an overall supplemental package, which also 
contains money for Central American disaster victims. Lawmakers 
have also indicated they will add about $9 billion for the 
confrontation in Kosovo to the package. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the money would come out of this year's $111 billion  
surplus, which many lawmakers have pushed to save for Social 
Security. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal being considered for farmers has $1.5 billion to  
make up for a shortfall in last year's disaster package and $2.8 
billion in additional market transition payments to compensate for 
low prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the quickest way of getting funds out there,'' Sen. Tom  
Harkin, D-Iowa, said of the market transition payments. Farmers 
already get the payments each year as part of the 1996 farm law. 
The money being discussed by senators would amount to about a 50 
percent increase in the annual payment to farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's emergency package also included $2.8 billion in  
market transition payments, as well as $2.3 billion in disaster 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
	The market payments were disbursed not long after the bill was  
passed last fall, but Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman has 
complained about the burdensome process required to distribute the 
disaster payments. Because of the problems, the disaster payments 
are not expected to be delivered to farmers until June. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the problem, lawmakers said Wednesday USDA told them  
recently that an additional $1.5 billion is needed to accommodate 
the large numbers of eligible farmers who signed up for disaster 
aid. Sign-up was only completed last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those people are not going to get what they thought they were  
going to get, because there's not sufficient money,'' Conrad said. 
</P>
<P>
	The supplemental process has already been contentious and it is  
unclear whether House budgeters would be receptive to the Senate 
idea. The farm loan money has been on hold since March while 
lawmakers fought over offsets. Glickman has said that many state 
farm offices are already out of money to authorize loans for 
farmers.

<HEADLINE> Honda Plans Eastern Alabama Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- American Honda Motor Co. Inc. has picked  
eastern Alabama for the site of its third U.S. auto production 
plant and said today it will hire up to 1,500 people to build 
either minivans, sport utility vehicles or both. 
</P>
<P>
	American Honda executive vice president Tom Elliott said the  
plant was vital because sales of light trucks, such as minivans and 
sport utility vehicles, are expected to exceed half of all U.S. 
auto sales by next year. Honda's Odyssey minivan and SUVs are 
strong sellers, Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Government and private groups have committed $102.7 million in  
incentives to purchase the land and get the site ready for 
construction as well as putting together training programs for 
employees. In addition, Honda will receive $55.6 million in tax 
breaks, according to the governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
	The $400 million, 1.7 million-square-foot plant is being built  
at the Talladega County community of Lincoln, about 35 miles east 
of Birmingham. Illinois, Georgia and Virginia were reported to also 
have been in the running. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction is to begin in mid-2000 and production is scheduled  
to begin in the spring of 2002. Full capacity is expected to be 
reached in 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to vehicle production, the Alabama plant will make  
V6 engines. Honda already makes cars at two plants in Ohio, where 
the company also has an engine plant. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second international automaker to pick Alabama for  
production. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, Alabama offered $253 million in tax breaks and other  
incentives to lure what is now DaimlerChrysler AG to Vance, a 
community about 30 miles west of Birmingham. The first 
Mercedes-Benz plant in the United States now has 1,700 employees 
and makes the M-Class sport utility vehicle.

<HEADLINE> Teen Hits 3 HRs, Throws No-Hitter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAYLORVILLE, Ill. (AP) -- Bill Clayton felt like Nolan Ryan and  
Fernando Tatis rolled into one. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chatham Glenwood High junior hit three homers in the second  
inning and threw a no-hitter in the Redskins' 27-2 victory Tuesday 
over Taylorville High. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the National High School Sports Record Book,  
Clayton is the third high school player to hit three homers in one 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Tramer Ray, a senior at Medicine Lodge, Kan., broke a national  
RBIs record by driving in 11 runs with two grand slams and a 
three-run homer in an inning last month. Danny Kimura of Honolulu 
hit three homers in an inning in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Clayton drove in eight of Glenwood's 22 runs in the second.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just thought, two in one inning, that's something I'll  
probably never do again,'' said Clayton, who had three homers 
coming in. ``But I got all of that one, too. They were calling me 
Tatis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tatis, a St. Louis Cardinals third baseman, hit two grand slams  
in one inning April 23, becoming the first major leaguer to 
accomplish the feat. 
</P>
<P>
	Clayton (6-0) struck out five and gave up two unearned runs in  
five innings.

<HEADLINE> Puerto Rico Seeks More U.S. Input </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Puerto Rico's governor and other political  
leaders gave different interpretations of an inconclusive statehood 
referendum last December and said Congress shares the blame for the 
confusion over the island's future. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sometimes heated Senate Energy Committee hearing Thursday,  
several senators demanded that Puerto Ricans take more initiative 
in defining their future options. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing before a packed audience considered the Dec. 13  
referendum on Puerto Rico's future, when 46.6 percent supported 
statehood, 2.8 percent were for either independence or free 
association and a majority 50.3 percent cast their votes for ``none 
of the above.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current commonwealth arrangement, the 3.8 million  
residents of Puerto Rico are U.S. citizens, but they pay no federal 
taxes and cannot vote for president. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of an enhanced commonwealth status, under which the  
island would receive more political and economic independence, 
claimed that most of the ``none of the above'' voters backed their 
position, which was not on the ballot. ``The people of Puerto Rico 
were unambiguous in their rejection of statehood,'' said Anibal 
Acevedo Vila, president of the Popular Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	He was questioned sharply by Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., who said  
a status that would allow Puerto Rico to keep such benefits as $10 
billion a year in federal funding while not accepting new 
responsibilities is ``a false choice because there are no free 
lunches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Pedro Rossello, who supports statehood, said one clear  
conclusion was that the referendum was a rejection of the status 
quo. He said it was up to Congress to draw up a road map that would 
finally give Puerto Ricans a chance to choose their future course. 
</P>
<P>
	Rossello said only Oklahoma was a U.S. territory longer than  
Puerto Rico, which came under U.S. control after the 1898 
Spanish-American War. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruben Berrios Martinez, president of the Puerto Rican  
Independence Party, said Puerto Ricans had rejected statehood in 
referendums in 1993 and 1998 and Congress ``should take 'no' for a 
final answer'' and ``formally declare its willingness to decolonize 
Puerto Rico.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House last year by a one-vote margin passed a bill  
authorizing a Puerto Rican statehood referendum, but the Senate 
never acted, and the December vote was nonbinding. 
</P>
<P>
	There's little momentum in Congress for action this year. Some  
lawmakers are wary of promoting statehood for a Spanish-speaking 
island that is poorer than any of the 50 states, and -- to the 
disadvantage of Republicans -- would probably send Democrats to 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Craig Thomas, R-Wyo., told Rossello that it was up to the  
Puerto Ricans, not Congress, to define their future goals.

<HEADLINE> Puerto Rico Seeks More U.S. Input </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Puerto Rican leaders faulted Congress Thursday  
for failing to lay out a road map for the territory's future. 
Senators shot back that some Puerto Ricans are seeking a ``free 
lunch'' status giving them the benefits but not the 
responsibilities of federal union. 
</P>
<P>
	In a packed hearing of the Senate Energy Committee, Puerto Rican  
Gov. Pedro Rossello said a plebiscite last December on Puerto 
Rico's future proved inconclusive in part because Congress has yet 
to define the options -- from statehood to independence -- that are 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	``After 100 years of waiting, we would expect Congress to act on  
its responsibilities,'' said Rossello, who supports statehood. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year the House passed, by a single vote, a bill authorizing  
a Puerto Rico statehood referendum. When the Senate failed to move 
on the legislation, the island went ahead with its own plebiscite 
in which 46 percent supported statehood but a majority 50.3 percent 
cast ballots for a ``none of the above'' option. The rest voted for 
independence or free association. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current commonwealth arrangement, the 3.8 million  
residents of Puerto Rico are U.S. citizens and the island receives 
more than $10 billion a year in federal funds. Puerto Ricans, 
however, pay no federal taxes and cannot vote for president. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of an enhanced commonwealth status under which Puerto  
Ricans would receive more political and economic independence 
claimed that most of the ``none of the above'' voters backed their 
position, which was not on the ballot. ``The people of Puerto Rico 
were unambiguous in their rejection of statehood,'' said Anibal 
Acevedo Vila, president of the Popular Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Others said the protest vote was associated more with other  
frustrations with the system. Ruben Berrios Martinez, president of 
the Puerto Rican Independence Party, said that for the past decade 
``Congress has repeatedly failed to authorize a federally sponsored 
referendum, even when all Puerto Rican political parties have 
unanimously endorsed such a petition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prospects for congressional action this year are slim, with  
little enthusiasm about promoting statehood for an island that is 
Spanish-speaking, poorer than the other 50 states and -- to the 
disadvantage of Republicans -- would probably send Democrats to 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Craig Thomas, R-Wyo., in a heated exchange with Rossello,  
complained that ``you constantly come here and shift the blame to 
the Congress. ... I'm getting a little impatient with it always 
being our responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., also grilled Acevedo Vila about the  
commonwealth option, demanding that his party put in writing its 
stance on such issues as allowing Puerto Rico to enter trade 
agreements with other countries or override acts of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who would have Puerto Ricans keep their U.S. citizenship  
and income tax-free access to federal funding while giving them 
economic sovereignty are offering a ``false choice because there 
are no free lunches,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., called it the ``free beer and  
barbecue option.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Puerto Rican speakers also used the hearing to protest an  
incident last month where one man was killed and four injured 
during U.S. Navy live ammunition firing on the island of Vieques.

<HEADLINE> Businesses Reel From Tornadoes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The deadly tornadoes and storms that hit parts of the Midwest  
and South have had little impact on most national business 
operations, despite disrupting the lives of many employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Several companies with sites in Oklahoma City, the hardest-hit  
region, said it had been business as usual for the most part, with 
employees in other parts of the country able to fill in for local 
interruptions. 
</P>
<P>
	The tornadoes and storms, which began to descend upon the area  
on Monday and continued through the week, left dozens of people 
dead and thousands of homes and businesses destroyed in Oklahoma, 
Kansas, Texas and Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors, America Online and Southwest Airlines are among  
the companies with large operations in Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
	Southwest Airlines employs 1,200 people at its Oklahoma City  
reservation center and was forced to shut down that unit all day 
Tuesday so employees could take care of their homes and families. 
</P>
<P>
	``But our eight other reservation centers around the country  
were able to handle the calls,'' said Kristie Kerr, a spokeswoman 
for the Dallas-based airline. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerr said about 26 employees had homes destroyed by the  
tornadoes, and a number of others missed work due to the weather, 
which also forced the cancelation or delay of numerous flights in 
the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Southwest was collecting food and supplies to send to displaced  
employees and relief organizations. It also was setting up a 
special fund through the company credit union to help raise money, 
Kerr said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other major companies with ties to the area also were  
donating much-needed supplies and money to victims and relief 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just trying to answer whatever calls come in,'' said  
Shane Boyd, a spokesman for Fleming Cos., a food distribution 
company based in Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has been contacting grocery vendors to help with the  
relief effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking about truckloads of products, ultimately dozens  
of truckloads from vendors,'' Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 10 percent of the 1,200 people who wok at Fleming's  
Oklahoma City headquarters were personally affected by the 
tornadoes, he said. ``We had 20 that lost everything,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, General Motors Corp. said its Oklahoma City assembly  
plant, which manufactures the Chevrolet Malibu and Oldsmobile 
Cutlass, was spared from damage and production would not be 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
	About 110 of its 3,500 employees lost everything, and another 40  
suffered some property losses, according to Frank Lee, president of 
United Auto Workers Local 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW and plant management are providing assistance to the  
victims, and have even taken out full-page newspaper ads to 
advertise a special hotline for affected workers. Both are helping 
find temporary housing for displaced families and have organized a 
``gate drive'' to donate clothing and supplies. On Wednesday, they 
announced a $300,000 donation to the American Red Cross, Salvation 
Army and Feed the Children. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online, which employees 1,200 people at a call center in  
Oklahoma City, said operations weren't affected by the storms. But 
20 employees had homes damaged or destroyed, said Andrew Weinstein, 
a spokesman for the Dulles, Va., company. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're working with those employees to help them rebuild,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Premier Parks Inc. of Oklahoma City, which operates 34 theme  
parks around the world, including Six Flags, said neither its 
operations nor employees were affected by the storms. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lucked out. No one was impacted,'' said Jane Braden, a  
spokeswoman.

<HEADLINE> Corn, Soybeans Down; Wheat Up / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Corn and soybean futures retreated Thursday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade, while wheat edged higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans faced continued pressure from forecasts for  
more favorable planting weather over the next week and on 
increasing deliveries of crops stored from last year's harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans were finding some support, however, on talk that corn  
plantings actually may be higher than previously estimated. That 
would mean fewer acres planted to soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures were pressured by expectations for a large winter  
wheat crop that would increase already ample inventories, but 
finished slightly higher in a late round of position-covering. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery rose 1/4 cent to $2.62 1/4 a bushel; July  
corn fell 2 cents to $2.19 3/4 a bushel; July oats rose 3/4 cent to 
$1.19 1/2 a bushel; July soybeans fell 1 1/4 cents to $4.83 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle were mixed, while feeder cattle were lower on the  
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Pork futures advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle fell 0.50 cent to 61.40 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell 0.32 cent to 72.15 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
rose 1.02 cents to 58.92 cents a pound; July pork bellies rose 1.95 
cents to 59.25 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Dallas Cowboy Mark Tuinei Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLANO, Texas (AP) -- Mark Tuinei, a former Dallas Cowboys  
offensive lineman who helped them win three Super Bowl titles and 
was considered the team's toughest player during his 15 seasons, 
was found dead in his car Thursday morning. He was 39. 
</P>
<P>
	Plano police chief Bruce Glasscock said an unidentified friend  
who had been told to go to Tuinei's house to check on him found 
Tuinei unconscious in a vehicle. Efforts to revive him failed, and 
he was pronounced dead upon arriving at Medical Center of Plano, a 
north Dallas suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of death was not immediately known. Glasscock said  
foul play, alcohol or drugs were not believed to be involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing in the investigation at this time that would  
indicate that,'' Glasscock said. 
</P>
<P>
	A preliminary report from medical examiners was expected by  
midafternoon Thursday. However, Glasscock said it could take 
several days for any definitive information from an autopsy or 
toxicology reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief said he wasn't sure how long Tuinei had been passed  
out. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only information we have at this point is that it was a  
good portion of the morning,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Tuinei didn't have as high a profile as teammates such  
as Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith or even fellow offensive lineman Nate 
Newton, ``Tui'' (TWO-ey) was extremely popular in the locker room 
and the community. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was just a good person, always had a smile on his face and  
always would take time to talk to any individual,'' Cowboys 
defensive line coach Jim Bates said. ``He was just a good team 
guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team canceled a voluntary workout scheduled for Thursday.  
Several players and coaches who had arrived for the practice left 
in a solemn mood. Many said they were too shook up to talk to 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sad moment, not just for players but for the whole  
organization,'' said linebacker Randall Godfrey, a teammate for one 
season. ``It's sad for his family, but you also hurt for guys like 
Troy Aikman, Moose (Daryl) Johnston, Charles Haley -- those guys who 
had memories with him. That's who really feels it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glasscock said he didn't know whether the unidentified friend  
was a member of the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuinei's wife, Pono, was in their home state of Hawaii, where  
she was notified by family members, police said. The couple did not 
have children. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuinei's career ended following the 1997 season because of  
lingering problems in both knees. The two-time Pro Bowler was 
released in April 1998 with hopes that he'd return in the fall, but 
he couldn't make it back. 
</P>
<P>
	All the years of taking on 300-pound defenders had finally  
caught up to the 6-foot-5, 320-pound Tuinei, leaving him tied for 
the club record for longevity. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a record was an unlikely achievement for a player who came  
to the Cowboys in 1983 as an undrafted defensive lineman after 
playing just seven games his senior year at Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tuinei caught the attention of then-coach Tom Landry and  
played 10 games that season. In 1985, Tuinei was moved to offense 
and he became a full-time starter in 1987. He saw action at several 
spots on the line before settling in at left tackle, where he was 
responsible for blocking the quarterback's back. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite various injuries, tough-guy Tuinei played all but nine  
games from 1989 to 1996. Over that span, the Cowboys went from 1-15 
in Aikman's rookie year to three-time Super Bowl champs (1993, '94, 
'96). 
</P>
<P>
	One of the highlights of Tuinei's career was playing in the Pro  
Bowl after the 1994 and 1995 seasons. He savored the appreciation 
of his peers, but he especially enjoyed getting to play in front of 
friends and family in his native Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuinei's tough side came from being raised in Nanakuli, a town  
of about 10,000 on the coast of Oahu. Fighting was part of growing 
up and Tuinei excelled at it, even though it often got him in 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends said Tuinei planned to move back to Hawaii next week to  
become the offensive line coach at Punahou High School, which he 
attended. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never seemed healthier or happier about going home,'' said  
friend Will Morris, who also attended the private school and met 
Tuinei at a Texas reunion of Punahou alumni about five years ago. 
``He was happy as can be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bates said Tuinei worked out in the team's weight room last  
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looked in great shape,'' Bates said. ``He was jovial.''  
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate word on memorial or funeral services.

<HEADLINE> Tipper Addresses Hollywood Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Citizen action, not government  
regulation, is the way to force Hollywood to curb violence in its 
products, Tipper Gore said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're only going to respond if they hear from the  
larger community,'' the wife of Vice President Al Gore said. ``If 
we decrease our appetite for this violence ... and if we say no, 
that is kind of voting with your pocketbook.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore, author of the 1987 book ``Raising PG Kids in an  
X-Rated Society,'' pressed the music industry to label sexually 
explicit records in the 1980s. The industry began voluntary 
labeling in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore, appearing at the 100th annual California State  
Parent-Teacher Association Convention, spoke about the school 
shooting in Littleton, Colo., that left 15 dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Violent video games and movies are only part of a ``toxic  
culture.'' Easy access to guns and lack of structured activities 
for young people play a role in that culture, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't point the finger of blame only at the entertainment  
industry that markets violent entertainment to kids,'' she said in 
the speech.

<HEADLINE> Scientists May Learn From Tornadoes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) -- Amid the rubble of Oklahoma, scientists  
hope to find clues to unlock the mysteries of deadly tornadoes. 
</P>
<P>
	The system that tore through the state might be especially  
revealing because it produced so many twisters and was tracked for 
so long by radar, researchers said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many things that are special and even historic about  
this storm,'' said Texas Tech meteorologist Steve Weinbeck. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers from Texas Tech hope to find the Holy Grail of  
tornado research -- the key to using radar to predict the path of 
the twisters. 
</P>
<P>
	While storm chasers traditionally are interested with what  
causes one storm to produce a tornado while another fizzles, 
``rubble rooters'' in Oklahoma are trying to find better ways to 
warn people which tornadoes are going to pose a serious threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``We try to learn from looking at the path of the tornado, with  
the goal of being able to look at a radar and know how powerful it 
is and where it's going,'' Weinbeck said. ``Right now, people have 
to rely on reports from the ground. If you could get that from 
radar, you'd get more emergency personnel where it's needed, as 
it's happening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other Texas Tech teams are combing through the rubble to learn  
which rooms in a house are most likely to survive twisters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Among all the devastation there is usually a safe area in  
homes,'' said researcher Larry Tanner. ``We seem to find that many 
times a small interior space towards the middle of the home can 
withstand incredible devastation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That may be because rooms in the center of the house benefit  
from all of the house's structural support, Tanner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the destroyed homes in Oklahoma seem to support the theory  
that a tornado strips a house in layers, working toward the center.

<HEADLINE> Ex-POWs Celebrate Geneva Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two former POWs who have risen to high office  
-- Sen. John McCain and Rep. Sam Johnson -- celebrated the 50th 
anniversary of the Geneva Conventions on Thursday, but both said 
the human rights accords were largely ignored by their North 
Vietnamese captors. 
</P>
<P>
	At ceremonies sponsored by the American Red Cross, Johnson,  
R-Texas, said even Yugoslavia has adhered to the conventions' 
requirement for humane treatment of prisoners during wartime more 
than North Vietnam did during its war with America. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia released three American soldiers this week after  
belatedly allowing a Red Cross visit, and NATO was expected to 
release two Yugoslav soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think our friends in Europe are more attuned to our  
humanitarian ideals than perhaps the Asian nations are,'' Johnson 
said. He did not address the concerns NATO has for Yugoslav 
treatment of civilians, who are also protected by the Geneva 
Conventions. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said neither he nor McCain saw legitimate Red Cross  
workers during their years of captivity, and neither was treated 
according to the Geneva Conventions. 
</P>
<P>
	The accords, adopted by 188 countries since 1949, aim to protect  
human life and dignity in wartime. They require that soldiers be 
relieved of suffering from wounds and illness, that prisoners of 
war be treated humanely and not tortured, and that civilians be 
protected by all sides in war. They also provide for Red Cross and 
Red Crescent access to military and nonmilitary victims of war, 
including prisoners and refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson and McCain both were prisoners of the North Vietnamese  
for several years and were together in the prison known as the 
Hanoi Hilton, playing bridge with toilet paper for cards. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said that although North Vietnam ``at one time or another  
violated most of the conventions,'' the international accords put 
meaningful pressure on his captors. 
</P>
<P>
	``War is wretched beyond description, and only a fool or a fraud  
could sentimentalize its cruel reality,'' said McCain. He said the 
North Vietnamese worried that their cruelties might be discovered. 
</P>
<P>
	``When word of torture and mistreatment began to slip out to the  
American press in the summer of 1969, our public relations-minded 
captors began to treat us better,'' McCain said. ``I'm certain we 
would have been a lot worse off it there had not been the Geneva 
Conventions around, which an international consensus formed about 
some very basic standards of decency that should apply even amid 
the cruel excess of war.''

<HEADLINE> Jagr Leading Penguins Into Round Two </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Fun-loving. Charismatic. Immature. Gifted.  
Emotional. 
</P>
<P>
	Many words have been used to describe Jaromir Jagr, hockey's  
most creative scorer and recognizable face now that Wayne Gretzky 
and Mario Lemieux are retired. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's a word never used until now: Courageous.  
</P>
<P>
	That changed Sunday, when the badly injured Jagr dragged himself  
off a trainer's table and onto the ice for a game he wasn't 
supposed to play, indelibly etching an unforgettable image of 
fearlessness. 
</P>
<P>
	Remember Willis Reed limping onto the court to help win Game 7  
of the 1970 NBA Finals for the New York Knicks? Many hockey fans 
will relive Jagr's performance in pain with the same mix of 
wonderment and respect. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was unbelievable what he did,'' said Pittsburgh teammate  
Martin Straka, invoking another adjective as synonymous with Jagr 
as his first name. 
</P>
<P>
	Barely able to skate because of a groin injury that sidelined  
him for four games, Jagr scored the tying goal late in the third 
period and the game-winner in overtime against top-seeded New 
Jersey. By doing so, he saved the Penguins not only from 
elimination, but possible extinction as the franchise's future is 
played out to an uncertain fate in bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr was almost as good in Game 7, drawing so much attention  
from the snare drum-tight Devils that it changed the tempo of the 
game. He set up the final two goals as the last-seeded Penguins 
upset the top-seeded Devils, finishing off the greatest upset in 
franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with a second-round series against Toronto set to begin  
Friday, what possibly could be left for Jagr to do? 
</P>
<P>
	As it turns out, quite a lot.  
</P>
<P>
	``I went into it to win the Stanley Cup. I'm not going for  
anything else,'' said Jagr, who is not close to 100 percent but 
still expects to play. ``I know that sounds very confident, but 
that is the way I am. I think we have the chance to beat anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Preposterous? So was beating the Devils.  
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky passed the torch, and the title of ``hockey's greatest  
player,'' to Jagr during teary-eyed ceremonies last month, spoiled 
only a little when Jagr sent Gretzky out a loser by scoring the 
game-winning goal in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Jagr -- once derided as being too self-centered,  
ingenuous and childlike to be the leader of men, much less of an 
entire sport -- has been a fitting replacement for hockey's one 
irreplaceable player. 
</P>
<P>
	``The greatest player leaves the game and the next greatest  
player scores in overtime, just to announce who the next guy is,'' 
Penguins coach Kevin Constantine said. 
</P>
<P>
	Constantine got his share of grief for overseeing Jagr's  
appointment last fall as the Penguins' captain. Jagr always was 
more of a follower of former captains Lemieux and Ron Francis than 
a leader, and his penchant for speaking his mind -- especially in 
disagreement with his coach -- is not a quality sought in a captain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jaromir not only is the best player on this team, he is the  
best player in the world,'' Constantine said. ``He needs to be the 
captain of this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Constantine's faith in Jagr as a leader was justified by the  
Jersey series. Jagr's valorous effort likely would be the talk of 
the sports world if the NHL had the high national profile of the 
NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could not watch,'' Jagr said. ``I had to play.''  
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, Jagr no longer is the impressionable 18-year-old who  
was fascinated by fast cars and fast skating when he came into the 
league in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	He is 27, more worldly and adult. He doesn't frequent night  
clubs or casinos as much as before. He talks privately of a 
personal spiritual reawakening that took place back in his native 
Czech Republic last summer, though he will not expound on it. 
</P>
<P>
	Even more remarkably, Jagr's play has come against the backdrop  
of the Penguins' uncertain fate as the NHL presses for a resolution 
of bankruptcy proceedings. It is possible the Penguins will know 
definitely they are headed for another city even before the 
playoffs are over. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux saved hockey in Pittsburgh. Jagr is trying to do it  
again, by taking the Penguins so deep into the playoffs that it 
rallies civic and business leaders to help preserve them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think my goal is going to save the team in Pittsburgh.  
It has nothing to do with that, but I think the city and everybody 
should support Mario,'' Jagr said. ``We're just trying to win the 
Cup.''

<HEADLINE> Pilot Takes Stand in Cable Car Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A Marine pilot charged with  
obstruction of justice said he regrets helping destroy a videotape 
of the training flight that caused 20 deaths at an Italian ski 
resort. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish we would have left the tape there,'' said Capt. Richard  
Ashby, 32, of Mission Viejo, Calif. ``If we had taken the tape, we 
should have turned it over to somebody to watch. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to get out of the aircraft. I was shaking. I wanted  
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A rebuttal prosecution witness, Bernard Coogan, an aircraft  
accident expert, testified today that the videotape would have 
given investigators images to compare with flight recorder data. 
</P>
<P>
	Closing arguments were scheduled for this afternoon before the  
case goes to the seven-man military jury. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense rested Wednesday after Ashby testified for more than  
two hours at his obstruction of justice and conspiracy trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby faces 10 years in prison or dismissal from the service if  
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Feb. 3, 1998, training flight, the right wing of  
Ashby's four-man EA-6B Prowler cut a gondola cable at Cavalese, 
Italy. Twenty people plunged 370 feet to their deaths. A separate 
jury acquitted Ashby in March of 20 manslaughter charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby had testified that he handed the videotape to his  
navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, who later threw the tape into a 
bonfire. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer ``wanted it gone. I wanted to look at it. That's all  
I've ever said,'' Ashby said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no conversation that went as far as, `This is why I  
want to do this.' There was no time,'' Ashby said. ``I took the 
tape out and put in my G-suit pocket and he handed me another tape 
and I put it in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby maintains that he did not intend to obstruct justice.  
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, N.Y., pleaded guilty to the same  
obstruction charges Ashby faces and was sentenced to dismissal from 
the service.

<HEADLINE> Tornado Hits Neighborhood Twice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOORE, Okla. (AP) -- Doug and Dee Powers' house was damaged by a  
tornado in October, and they had barely finished repairing it when 
another, more destructive twister roared through the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Their house may be a total loss this time.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's like lightning never strikes twice. You never think it  
will happen, but it did,'' said Mrs. Powers, who grew up in the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
	Harold Brooks, a researcher at the National Severe Storms  
Laboratory in Norman, said the chances of a tornado hitting a given 
location even just once are small. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kind of wind speeds we're looking at from Monday will  
probably occur at that location maybe once in a million years,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tornado in October did about $3,000 in damage to the Powers  
home. This time, the couple were just two houses away from a direct 
hit. One wall was stripped away and there was other structural 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the couple were on the front lawn, along with the  
belongings they have salvaged, waiting for an insurance adjuster. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we're back past square one. We're further back than we  
were last time,'' Mrs. Powers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Kelleher, a National Weather Service meteorologist, said:  
``Is this an area that's conducive to tornado paths? I don't think 
so. It's just bad luck.''

<HEADLINE> Lobbyists Succeed With Banking Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As a March snowstorm paralyzed the capital,  
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm gathered 40 lobbyists 
for the banking, insurance and securities industries to deliver a 
blunt message. 
</P>
<P>
	If they wanted to eliminate Depression-era barriers prohibiting  
banks, securities firms and insurance companies from delving into 
each other's business, they were ``going to have to do some work,'' 
declared Gramm, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months later, on Thursday, the bill passed the Senate, where  
similar legislation had died just six months earlier. The measure 
is the product of a furious lobbying effort that paired a powerful 
committee chairman with cash-flush industries in the battle to 
reverse doubts among lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the legislation was doomed both by concerns it would  
create financial superstores unfriendly to consumers and squabbles 
over whether to repeal requirements that financial institutions 
demonstrate they have made loans to minorities and low-income 
people in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing was left to chance this time.  
</P>
<P>
	The American Bankers Association flew in 200 bankers from around  
the country this week to meet with senators. The Securities 
Industry Association's Web site flashed ``Urgent!'' and asked 
visitors to send a form letter to their senators. 
</P>
<P>
	And Merrill Lynch, the brokerage firm, ran weekly newspaper ads  
directed at lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	But what set this lobbying effort apart from the many each year  
in Washington was the extensive role Gramm played in organizing it. 
Since the March gathering, he has continued to meet regularly with 
the lobbyists to discuss their strategy and get progress reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm's office said he got the idea from watching Sen. Robert  
Byrd, D-W.Va., mobilize interest groups in the last Congress to 
successfully amend the surface transportation bill to ensure 
gasoline taxes were spent on highways. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaving nothing to chance, the Texas Republican has done plenty  
of lobbying of his own, buttonholing more than half of his 99 
colleagues to make his own pitch. ``I find that in talking to 
people face-to-face, you tend to get their attention,'' Gramm said. 
</P>
<P>
	Observed Sen. Spence Abraham, R-Mich: ``He's been briefing  
everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm, a longtime supporter of the financial industry, received  
$1.8 million in campaign contributions between 1993 and 1998 from 
banks, savings and loans, insurers and securities firms. That's 
more than any other member of the Senate, according to the Center 
for Responsive Politics. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry has much invested in Congress, doling out $23.3  
million to congressional candidates in the 1998 election cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm's bill would make it easier for banks, securities firms  
and insurance companies to enter each other's business. 
</P>
<P>
	A bank, for example, could write insurance and sell stocks in  
addition to offering savings and checking accounts. A firm that 
sells stocks could also sell insurance and set up its own bank. 
Consumers would shop at, in Gramm's words, ``a supermarket for 
financial services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the bill are not nearly as well-heeled. Three  
consumer groups opposing the legislation -- Consumers Union, the 
Consumer Federation of America, and the U.S. Public Interest 
Research Group -- spent $540,000 to lobby during the last six months 
of 1998. Three industry groups lobbying for the bill -- the American 
Bankers Association, the Securities Industry Association and the 
American Council of Life Insurance -- spent 12 times that, or $6.7 
million, during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the opponents are making their position known. Some are  
lobbying against a provision in the legislation that exempts small 
banks from the Community Reinvestment Act, which requires financial 
institutions to document how they invest money in all communities 
that they receive deposits from. 
</P>
<P>
	Community development organizations have sent letters telling  
real-life success stories, like that of the New York City 
businesswoman who received a loan to start her company and the 
Mississippi resident who got a home mortgage, all because banks had 
to provide money under the CRA. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's one of the things local groups can talk to their  
senators about, these kinds of details about what's happening in 
their communities,'' said Debby Goldberg, a neighborhood 
reinvestment specialist with the Center for Community Change. The

<HEADLINE> Glitches Delay Flights for 2nd Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A computer problem at the air traffic control  
center delayed departures from airports in New York, Newark, N.J., 
and Philadelphia on Thursday, the second day such glitches have 
affected a major travel corridor. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before 6:30 a.m. EDT, the air traffic control center in  
Ronkonkoma, N.Y., on Long Island went out for unexplained reasons, 
forcing a switch to a backup system, said FAA spokesman Jim Peters. 
That prompted controllers to increase the separation between 
departing flights from 10 to 20 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	At Newark, 146 departures were delayed an average of 41 minutes,  
with the maximum delay lasting 73 minutes. Normal service resumed 
at 11:26 a.m., Peters said. 
</P>
<P>
	At New York's LaGuardia Airport, 80 departures were delayed an  
average of 41 minutes, the maximum delay lasting 61 minutes. 
Flights got back on schedule at 9:36 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	In Philadelphia, 48 flights were delayed an average of 28  
minutes, with the maximum wait lasting 51 minutes. Normal service 
resumed at 9:17 a.m., Peters said. 
</P>
<P>
	Flights in and out of John F. Kennedy International Airport were  
not affected. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, computer problems at the main air traffic control  
center for Chicago's O'Hare International and Midway airports 
caused numerous flight delays and cancellations for passengers 
traveling into and out of the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Takeoffs and landings were delayed for an hour or more, said  
Chicago Aviation Department spokeswoman Monique Bond. 
</P>
<P>
	The trouble started when the Tracon Center in Elgin tested new  
software that displays a plane's size on radar screens, said Tony 
Molinaro, a spokesman at the Federal Aviation Administration's 
Great Lakes office. 
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines canceled 25 percent -- 164 -- of its afternoon  
flights into and out of O'Hare, said spokeswoman Kristina Price. 
American Airlines canceled 42 of its 337 flights, said spokeswoman 
Mary Frances Fagan.

<HEADLINE> Four Killed in Nightclub Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL MONTE, Calif. (AP) -- A gunman shot a man to death today at a  
nightclub after an argument, then sprayed the booth where the 
victim was sitting with bullets and killed three of the five others 
seated there. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting happened about 1:45 a.m. in the International Club  
in El Monte, about 12 miles east of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman had argued with one of the victims and returned with  
a semiautomatic handgun, said Los Angeles County sheriff's Lt. Ray 
Peavy. 
</P>
<P>
	The man with whom he had argued was shot in the head, while two  
men and a woman sitting nearby were sprayed with gunfire, Peavy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as he shot him, he reportedly just continued firing  
the gun at will and hit the other three victims, who just happened 
to be sitting there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two women also seated in the booth were not injured.  
</P>
<P>
	Peavy said it's not uncommon for patrons to share one of the  
club's large horseshoe-shaped booths even if they don't know each 
another. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 15 other patrons were inside the club when the shooting  
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman fled after the shooting and remained free hours  
later, but he may have been videotaped by a surveillance camera. 
Sheriff's technicians worked this morning to enhance the video in 
hopes of getting a better image of the suspect, Peavy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators compiled a description of the gunman from  
witnesses, who did not know the man's name, Peavy said. The cause 
of the argument that led to the shooting was unknown.

<HEADLINE> Beckett's 'Molloy' Has US Premiere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``Molloy'' is, finally, an accessible, really  
funny Samuel Beckett theater piece. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of a nearly wordless man feeling the inside of the  
invisible box that holds him, or some other Beckett staging that 
mystifies much of the audience, ``Molloy'' tells a story. Much of 
it is hilarious. 
</P>
<P>
	Compiled from Beckett's 1951 novel, ``Molloy,'' which is the  
first in a trilogy, the play opened Thursday in its American 
premiere at the Irish Arts Center. Irish actor Conor Lovett 
performed Molloy with a gentle speaking voice and skillful timing. 
</P>
<P>
	The theme of ``Molloy'' is stated in the third book in the  
trilogy, ``The Unnamable'': ``You must go on. I can't go on. I'll 
go on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Molloy, an old Irishman, is obviously in terrible physical  
shape, which he describes with sardonic wit. He's even funnier 
relating anecdotes about mishaps that befall him. It is easy to 
recognize yourself or someone you know in some of Molloy's 
experiences. 
</P>
<P>
	First, he talks about visiting his blind, ancient mother; he  
knocks on her skull when he wants her to give him money. 
</P>
<P>
	On the way to see her one day, he rested, leaning forward on his  
bicycle handlebars, which gets him arrested for doing something 
against public decency. He's told that his short, stiff leg is no 
excuse -- there aren't two sets of laws, one for the crippled. 
Having no papers, domicile or occupation and not being sure of his 
name or his mother's address doesn't help his case at the police 
station. 
</P>
<P>
	Released the next afternoon, Molloy gets on his bicycle and  
almost immediately runs over a dog on a leash. A crowd is ready to 
beat him up but the owner, who talks nonstop, says she was taking 
the dog to the veterinarian to be put down. He helps her bury the 
dog and meets her parrot, which, from its language, previously 
belonged to a French sailor and an American sailor. 
</P>
<P>
	As Beckett was wont to write, Molloy also describes his private  
parts and bodily functions. 
</P>
<P>
	Lovett and director Judy Hegarty compiled the one-act play,  
which is presented by the Gare St. Lazare Players. After an 
intermission, the Irish Arts Center shows a film, ``Waiting for 
Beckett.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Molloy'' has been on tour since its debut in London in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Baltimore Set To Demolish Stadium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Baltimore has settled on a plan to demolish  
Memorial Stadium next year to make way for a 446-unit senior 
housing development and a recreation center. 
</P>
<P>
	City Housing Commissioner Daniel P. Henson III announced the  
decision on Wednesday, ending some three years of debate about the 
fate of the abandoned, 46-year-old stadium and its 30 acres of 
prime real estate. 
</P>
<P>
	Completed in 1953, the northeast Baltimore stadium has been  
vacant since Dec. 14, 1997, when the Baltimore Ravens played their 
last football game there. The team moved across town to a $223 
million stadium south of the baseball park at Camden Yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Memorial Stadium was once the heart of Baltimore's sports  
universe. John Unitas threw his final touchdown pass for the 
Baltimore Colts there. It's where the Orioles clinched their second 
World Series championship, and Frank Robinson ripped a home run 
completely out of the ballpark -- the only player to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember the first time I went to watch a football game at  
Memorial Stadium, when I was 12 or 13 years old,'' Henson told The 
(Baltimore) Sun. ``But all of us recognize that this is a building 
that is going to fall down on us at some point, and we need to let 
it go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plans for the senior citizens' housing project, which Mayor  
Kurt L. Schmoke talked about during his weekly news conference 
Thursday, represent a victory for community groups that lobbied for 
the recreation center and housing. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents opposed two alternative developments -- a high-tech  
center and a retail complex -- fearing they would bring traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	The nonprofit Govans Ecumenical Development Corp. (GEDCO) will  
have until Nov. 8 to obtain financing for the $43 million project 
and conduct a study to convince the city that there is enough 
demand among senior citizens for housing, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	No city money will be used for the project.  
</P>
<P>
	If the developer clears these hurdles, the city will sell some  
of the land to the developer and demolish the stadium in early 
2000. The state has committed $10 million to help tear down the 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
	State Comptroller William Donald Schaefer said Thursday the  
decision should have been put on hold. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not fair for the current administration to saddle the  
state or the next mayor with decisions as important as these,'' he 
said.

	NATO Strikes Yugoslavia Fuel Depots  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO jets struck fuel depots  
throughout Yugoslavia as diplomats from the United States, Russia 
and major European powers gathered today to try to agree on the 
outlines of a Kosovo peace accord. Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright joined European foreign ministers today in Bonn, Germany, 
to discuss an interim administration for Kosovo and the creation of 
a military force to protect ethnic Albanian refugees returning to 
the Yugoslav province. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Meets Kosovo Refugees  
</P>
<P>
	INGELHEIM, Germany (AP) -- President Clinton commiserated today  
with ethnic Albanian refugees and said Russia is nearing agreement 
with G-8 nations on a military force ``so you can go home again and 
be safe and free'' once the fighting stops in Kosovo. At a refugee 
processing center, Clinton sat on metal chairs with about a dozen 
refugees and heard their gratitude for NATO's efforts to stop 
ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. Today's visit to Ingelheim and a later 
call on German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder in Bonn cap Clinton's 
two-day swing through this part of Europe.

	Powerful Storms Strike Tennessee  
</P>
<P>
	LINDEN, Tenn. (AP) -- A line of powerful storms blew through  
western Tennessee early today, closing schools, damaging buildings 
in 30 counties and killing at least four people. Two of the 
victims, a man and woman, died in a Linden home that was destroyed 
by straight-line winds, said Capt. Gary Rogers of the Perry County 
rescue service. A 14-year-old girl who was missing last night was 
found early today and taken to a hospital where she died on 
arrival. The fourth victim was killed when his car hit a tree that 
had been blown across a highway about 80 miles northeast of 
Memphis.

	U.S. To Inspect North Korean Site

	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- A U.S. team will begin inspecting a  
possible nuclear weapons site in North Korea on May 18, South 
Korean officials said today. About 15 American officials and 
nuclear experts will spend several days inspecting the site at 
Kumchang-ri, northwest of the North's capital of Pyongyang, they 
said. At least two inspections are planned to clear U.S. suspicions 
that the communist country may be reactivating a nuclear weapons 
program frozen under a 1994 agreement with Washington.

condition of anonymity. A Division of Parole spokesman would say

president of the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, apparently killed 
himself late last night or early this morning, a Tokyo police

injured Carlos Perez, held the Expos hitless until Orlando Cabrera 
singled leading off the sixth. Sheffield hit a three-run homer off 
Javier Vazquez in the third for a 3-0 lead. He hit his seventh home 
run, a solo shot, in the ninth off Guierrmo Mota.

<HEADLINE> La Nina-Tornado Link Eyed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Oklahoma's catastrophic tornadoes were influenced by La Nina,  
the weather phenomenon 5,000 miles west of the prairie in the 
Pacific Ocean, scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
	It's part of the same widespread weather trend that dumped a  
record 91 feet of snow on Mount Baker in Washington this winter and 
triggered severe drought and wildfires in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``The signal is there,'' said Steve Byrd, science officer for  
the National Weather Service in Omaha, Neb. ``The incidence of 
tornadoes on the central Plains is slightly higher during La 
Nina.'' 
</P>
<P>
	La Nina refers to a large, unusually cold pool of water in the  
equatorial Pacific Ocean that develops every several years, and 
influences weather patterns around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	It works in reverse of the more common and better-understood El  
Nino, which is a warming of Pacific waters. 
</P>
<P>
	La Nina has generated a stronger, colder jet stream in the upper  
atmosphere, while warm, wet air at lower levels has been pulled 
from the Gulf of Mexico into the Plains states. 
</P>
<P>
	This combination generated the ferocious thunderstorms that  
spawned dozens of twisters, including a historic F-5 tornado in 
Oklahoma City. An F-5 is the most powerful tornado there is. At 
least 41 people have died in Oklahoma alone as the result of the 
severe weather. 
</P>
<P>
	The current La Nina has persisted for nearly a year. Most La  
Ninas last only several months, and there are signs that this one 
is beginning to wane. 
</P>
<P>
	The weather pattern comes on the heels of an El Nino that  
dissipated in 1998. Studies suggest tornadoes were reduced by as 
much as 24 percent in some regions during the most recent El Nino. 
</P>
<P>
	El Ninos increase storm activity in California and South America  
while calming things down in the Atlantic and Caribbean. La Ninas, 
by contrast, reduce storms in California but stir up trouble in 
other parts of the country as well as in India and southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	This spring, meteorologists in Nebraska and Iowa already have  
tallied 17 tornadoes -- five more than normal by early May. ``We're 
already living up to predictions,'' Byrd said.

<HEADLINE> Kawasaki To Cut Work Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Kawasaki Steel Corp., a major Japanese steelmaker,  
said Thursday it will cut about 1,500 jobs, or more than 10 percent 
of its work force, as part of a restructuring plan designed to trim 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's No. 3 steel producer plans to shed the jobs through  
attrition to bring its payroll down to 9,500 employees by the 
spring of 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Kawasaki said the move was prompted by concern about falling  
steel prices due to a worldwide production glut, something it does 
not expect to end soon. 
</P>
<P>
	It estimates total Japanese steel output will likely drop to 97  
million tons in the current business year, down from a 27-year low 
of 100.3 million tons last year. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its restructuring, Kawasaki said it hopes to bolster  
profitability by merging some operations of affiliates with those 
of its parent company to increase efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
	It also plans to sell unused land and other assets, along with  
slashing its stockpiles of products and raw materials. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost-cutting will help pair its interest-bearing debt by a  
third to $10.8 billion, the company said.

<HEADLINE> Jury Gets Steele Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- Julie Hiatt Steele's trial on charges of  
obstructing the independent counsel's investigation of the 
president moved swiftly to the jury Thursday after her lawyers 
declined to call any witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The three days of prosecution witnesses were dominated by the  
testimony of Kathleen Willey, a former White House employee whose 
allegation of an unwanted sexual advance by President Clinton was 
broadcast nationally last year. Ms. Steele is charged with making 
false statements to Kenneth Starr's investigators that did not 
corroborate Mrs. Willey's story. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton denied Mrs. Willey's account under oath when it was  
raised in a deposition in the Paula Jones sexual harassment 
lawsuit. A spokesman said the White House would have no comment on 
the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele's lawyers presented the case as one woman's word  
against another's. They accused Mrs. Willey of past lies and 
assailed her failure to remember clearly what she contends was her 
first conversation with Ms. Steele about the alleged incident, just 
hours after it happened in November 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele told investigators that Mrs. Willey first told her  
about the encounter with Clinton more than three years afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are only two people who know what happened between  
Kathleen Willey and Julie Hiatt Steele,'' defense attorney Nancy 
Luque said in closing arguments. ``You heard from Kathleen Willey. 
She doesn't remember.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the trial opened, Ms. Steele's defense team told jurors she  
would testify on her own behalf, but that plan was scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
	After the prosecution rested Thursday, defense lawyers asked  
U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton to dismiss all four charges 
against her -- three counts of obstruction of justice and one of 
making false statements in an FBI interview. They argued that her 
statements, true or not, weren't material to either Starr's 
investigation or the Jones sexual harassment lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	When Hilton declined, Luque announced she would rest her case.  
Jury deliberations began at 2 p.m. EDT. At one point jurors sent a 
question to the judge; he did not disclose publicly what it asked. 
Jurors quit for the day after 3 1/2 hours of deliberation. 
</P>
<P>
	Closing arguments began with prosecutor Stephen Binhak reminding  
jurors that Ms. Steele told investigators she first heard about the 
1993 Clinton-Willey encounter when Mrs. Willey called in March 1997 
and asked her to lie to a Newsweek reporter to back up her story. 
</P>
<P>
	Binhak said records show that call from Mrs. Willey's car phone  
lasted ``one measly minute.'' It would have been impossible for 
Mrs. Willey to relate the story of the alleged sexual advance and 
convince Ms. Steele to lie in that amount of time, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My grandmother didn't go to college, but she had a word for  
that: baloney,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Binhak also emphasized that three one-time friends of Ms. Steele  
testified that she said she had learned of Mrs. Willey's story 
before 1997 -- and that as investigators closed in Ms. Steele tried 
to persuade each of these people that she had not told them the 
story. Two of the witnesses said they were told about the incident 
before 1997. The third, a local TV producer, said Ms. Steele told 
him in 1997 she had learned about it shortly after it happened in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Luque said that Ms. Steele simply had a ``disagreement'' in  
recollection with the three witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Mrs. Willey who ``didn't tell the truth,'' she argued.  
</P>
<P>
	``She didn't tell the truth to the independent counsel. She  
didn't tell the truth to the FBI,'' Luque said. ``So ... why is 
Julie Hiatt Steele here?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Luque said it ``defies logic, defies common sense'' that Ms.  
Steele would lie since she stood to make more money by supporting 
Mrs. Willey's headline-grabbing account. Ms. Steele sold 
photographs of Mrs. Willey and Clinton to three media companies for 
a total of $15,500. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was sitting on a gold mine ... simply for corroborating  
Mrs. Willey,'' Luque said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor David Barger opened the trial by saying Ms. Steele  
had betrayed a friend and violated the rule of law. 
</P>
<P>
	In closing, Luque told the jury that the opposite was the case,  
that Mrs. Willey ``betrayed her friends'' and that ``Ken Starr 
betrayed the rule of law'' by bringing the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Barger countered that Ms. Steele had been given the opportunity  
to tell the truth three different times and ``she could have come 
clean'' to avoid prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors ``want to be fair,'' he told the jury.  
</P>
<P>
	In Richmond, Va., a three-judge appeals court panel ordered  
Hilton to reconsider his decision to keep some documents in the 
Steele case secret -- including, apparently, the results of a lie 
detector test for Mrs. Willey. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilton denied a request by news organizations, including The  
Associated Press, to unseal documents submitted in secret by 
Starr's office. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyer for Susan McDougal, in whose recent criminal trial  
Ms. Steele testified, said that Mrs. Willey flunked a polygraph 
examination. Steele's lawyers have said only that lie detector 
results are an issue for one of Starr's witnesses in the Steele 
case.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a May 3 story about .50-caliber sniper  
rifles, The Associated Press reported erroneously that such weapons 
are capable of penetrating a tank's armor from a mile away and were 
used against Iraqi tanks during the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
	Such rifles were used against Iraqi armored personnel carriers,  
bunkers and other military vehicles but would not normally be 
effective against modern tanks.

<HEADLINE> Store Puts Cigarette Ads On Own Sign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Tobacco companies agreed to quit putting the  
Marlboro man and other cigarette advertising on billboards last 
month as part of a settlement with the states, but that isn't 
stopping a convenience store chain from promoting Marlboros on its 
own highway signs. 
</P>
<P>
	A bright red pack of Marlboros being sold for ``$2.19 for  
limited time only'' is prominently featured on Wawa Food Markets 
billboards on I-76 and other major expressways. 
</P>
<P>
	As a retailer, the five-state chain said it is not affected by  
the tobacco settlement between the cigarette makers and the states. 
</P>
<P>
	But a leading anti-smoking advocate said the billboards run  
counter to the spirit of the agreement that called on tobacco 
companies to stop targeting youths with advertising images like the 
Marlboro man and Joe Camel. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not only any cigarette, but the brand of cigarette that  
is by far used the most by teen-agers. And it is advertising low 
prices, which would be particularly attractive to kids, who have 
the least disposable income,'' said Jeff Barg of Wayne, a medical 
newsletter publisher who heads the anti-smoking group Tobacco Free 
Education and Action Coalition for Health. 
</P>
<P>
	State Attorney General Mike Fisher is eying the Wawa billboards  
and considering what limitations the tobacco settlement imposes on 
retailers, spokesman Sean Connolly said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an issue that attorneys general in other states are  
dealing with, also. In Pennsylvania, Wawa is the only retailer we 
know of. We've had reports of others in other states,'' Connolly 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris, which makes Marlboros, is aware of the Wawa  
billboards and told the chain that it was ``committed to the letter 
and spirit of the settlement agreement we signed,'' said spokesman 
Brendan McCormick. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly had nothing to do with having these boards  
placed, and we would not encourage or condone anyone taking action 
that we could not take on our own,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But McCormick said Philip Morris cannot compel Wawa to take the  
boards down. He said Philip Morris asked the chain's owners ``to 
carefully consider their position'' on advertising cigarettes and 
``to consider the concerns raised by the attorney general's 
office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco companies agreed that cigarette billboards would come  
down by April 23 under their $206 billion settlement with 46 states 
over smoking-related health costs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wawa, a privately-held chain of nearly 500 stores in  
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia, said 
that as a retailer, it does not consider itself a participant in 
the tobacco settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, based in Middletown Township, 15 miles west of  
Philadelphia, issued a statement saying it intends to continue 
advertising low-priced cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wawa regularly advertises on billboards a variety of products,  
including hoagies, coffee, and ATMs,'' the company said, adding 
that the cigarette ads are ``general in nature ... not thematic or 
image-based advertisements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ads include the Surgeon General's warning and a commitment  
to prohibit sales to minors, said the statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Wawa spokeswoman Mandy Lain said they have gotten no monetary  
compensation from tobacco companies for the billboard 
advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an example of one of the loopholes. That's why I'm  
attacking the agreement. It was basically created to do as little 
as possible,'' said Dr. Robert Sklaroff, a Philadelphia cancer 
specialist who has an appeal pending in Commonwealth Court 
challenging Pennsylvania's participation in the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Other anti-smoking advocates disputed the argument that  
retailers could disregard the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those billboards should have been down two weeks ago and they  
are in violation of the settlement,'' said William T. Godshall of 
Pittsburgh, executive director of SmokeFree Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	Connolly said Fisher discusses such issues in a weekly  
conference call as a member of a billboard enforcement committee of 
attorneys general from several of the tobacco-settlement states. 
``It is distressing that some retailers may look at the settlement 
as an opportunity to fill an advertising void,'' said Connolly.

<HEADLINE>  Israeli Candidates Moving to Middle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUVLAN, West Bank (AP) -- Standing on sandbags at an Israeli army  
lookout, Ehud Barak talked tough about Mideast peace. 
</P>
<P>
	As prime minister, he said Thursday, he would keep most West  
Bank settlements under Israeli rule and sign a peace treaty with 
the Palestinians only if it was approved in a referendum. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak, leader of the dovish Labor Party, knows he needs to win  
over voters skeptical about land-for-peace agreements with the 
Palestinians if he wants to defeat Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu on May 17. 
</P>
<P>
	But with both candidates promising peace with security, their  
views are becoming increasingly indistinguishable. 
</P>
<P>
	Against a backdrop of the West Bank's sunbaked hillsides, Barak  
pledged that he would not abandon the settlements of the Jordan 
Valley, an area the Palestinians claim for their future state. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will have security and settlement (in) this area. This is  
going to be the security border of Israel,'' said Barak, a former 
armed forces chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite being Israel's most decorated soldier, Barak has  
struggled to define himself as security-minded opposite the 
hard-line Netanyahu. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Party negotiated autonomy agreements with the  
Palestinians when it was last in power, and Netanyahu has tried to 
portray Barak as unable to stand up to Palestinian demands. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu has tried to engage Barak in debate on peace issues,  
but the opposition leader has largely avoided him and instead has 
presented his own four-point plan in TV commercials. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak proposes that the Palestinians and Israelis live in  
separate entities. The West Bank, however, would be dotted with 
blocs of Jewish settlement under Israeli sovereignty. Jerusalem 
would remain united under Israeli rule. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would not agree to a (peace) agreement unless it has  
strengthened, not weakened the security of Israel,'' Barak said 
Thursday, balancing on the sloping roof of the Tuvlan outpost, 
surrounded by rolls of barbed wire and flanked by former generals. 
</P>
<P>
	Settler leaders smiled and nodded with satisfaction. Barak's  
words seemed to echo those of Netanyahu, who made a similar 
campaign swing through the Jordan Valley less than two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The prime minister promised to develop the isolated region,  
calling for expansion of the settler communities and the 
establishment of a high-tech industrial park. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu charged Thursday that Barak was vague in declaring the  
Jordan Valley the security border and was hiding his real intention 
of uprooting settlements. ``He didn't say what will be the future 
of the communities,'' Netanyahu said. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu won the 1996 election in part by presenting himself as  
a spokesman for the middle ground, an advocate of peace who would 
negotiate hard and not risk Israel's security. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years later, however, Netanyahu has found himself  
increasingly associated with hard-line settlers and right-wing 
politicians. Negotiations have made little progress and he 
suspended the Wye River interim peace agreement in December after 
hard-liners threatened to topple his government. 
</P>
<P>
	In the valley's settlements, some erstwhile Netanyahu backers  
disappointed by his zigzag course said they would switch to Barak, 
who has gained a slight lead in the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	At Maale Ephraim, the valley's largest settlement, 38-year-old  
Asher Emaliah spoke of his dissatisfaction with Netanyahu, whose 
earlier promises to bolster settlements have not materialized for 
this isolated community. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm for peace, even if it means having to leave Maaleh  
Ephraim,'' Emaliah said. ``And I'm not the only one. This place is 
just not developing. There is just no industry or development 
here.''

<HEADLINE> Cholesterol-Lowering Margarine Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two margarines that actually cut cholesterol  
will soon appear on supermarket shelves nationwide at a price tag 
four times the regular spread. 
</P>
<P>
	Market analysts suggest that many health-conscious Americans  
will be ready to try them anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Take Control, made by Unilever's Lipton unit began hitting the  
market last week, and Benecol, by the drug maker Johnson &AMP; Johnson, 
is nearing approval by the Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	They're among the first major foods that are designed to act  
like drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the companies plan to market them on two levels --  
the traditional way through advertising, and also by convincing 
doctors to suggest them to patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be an easy sell,'' said Roland Rust, a marketing  
professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn. ``It sounds 
like a winner to me, because there are a lot of people looking for 
a magic bullet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Connie Diekman, a registered dietitian in St. Louis, Mo. and  
spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association, stresses the 
margarines won't replace a careful diet and exercise. ``But it 
appears these products are one more way to lower your blood 
cholesterol level,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Take Control sells for about $3.70 for a 10 ounce package.  
Benecol is expected to sell in the same range, though J&AMP;J has yet 
to release a price. 
</P>
<P>
	Al Ries, a marketing consultant with Ries &AMP; Ries in Roswell,  
Ga., suggested the price may limit sales somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
	``A margarine that tastes good and has a cholesterol lowering  
ability is a very good combo and could touch a nerve with high-end 
folks,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies say consumers will pay the premium prices because  
of the growing awareness among Americans to control their 
cholesterol. More than one in three Americans have moderate to high 
cholesterol levels, a major risk factor for heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Lipton says Take Control is more expensive than regular  
margarine because of the high cost of extracting and processing the 
product's main ingredient, a natural soybean extract called plant 
sterols. 
</P>
<P>
	J&AMP;J spokesman Ron Schmid said Benecol's novel health benefits  
justify the higher price. Benecol's main ingredient, stanol ester, 
is derived from a substance found in pine trees. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Benecol and Take Control work by blocking the body from  
absorbing LDL, or bad cholesterol. Benecol will eventually also be 
available in cream cheese spreads and in salad dressing, J&AMP;J said. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for dietary supplements and herbals remedies has soared  
in the past few years as many Americans have looked for cheaper and 
safer alternatives to prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans are snapping up those supplements even without major  
scientific studies supporting the bold health claims of the 
manufacturers. With Benecol and Take Control, the companies already 
have the supporting scientific evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	One study showed regular use of Benecol could reduce cholesterol  
levels by 14 percent. Take Control was found to cut cholesterol by 
7 to 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Lipton says its experience selling butter and margarine will  
give it a boost over J&AMP;J which is primarily a medical device and 
health products company. Lipton makes Promise margarine and ``I 
Can't Believe It's Not Butter!'' 
</P>
<P>
	J&AMP;J contends its close relationship with doctors will give it an  
edge in selling them -- and their patients -- on Benecol. 
</P>
<P>
	Benecol was created the Raisio Group, a Finnish food and  
chemicals company, which introduced it in Finland in 1995 and is 
now partnering with J&AMP;J to sell it in Great Britain and the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	It was initially so popular that Finland stores could not keep  
shelves stocked even at prices six times more than regular 
margarine. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first, people went really crazy. It was the curiosity  
factor,'' said Veli-Pekka Nummelin, managing director of City 
Market, Finland's largest supermarket in Turku. 
</P>
<P>
	Buying has subsided since then, he said. Benecol now accounts  
for 10 percent of margarine sales in Finland. 
</P>
<P>
	Benecol was launched in Great Britain in March,

<HEADLINE> Bill Would Pressure FCC on Mergers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bill that would speed up the Federal  
Communications Commission's review of telecommunications and media 
mergers was approved today by a Senate panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee on a  
voice vote sent the measure to the full committee for 
consideration. The bill would set deadlines for the FCC to decide 
merger applications. 
</P>
<P>
	For mergers valued at more than $15 million, the FCC would have  
180 days after an application is filed to issue a decision. The 
application is deemed approved without conditions if the FCC 
doesn't act by the end of that period. 
</P>
<P>
	A majority of the FCC's five commissioners, however, can extend  
that deadline by 60 days. But they can seek an extension only once 
per merger. 
</P>
<P>
	For smaller mergers, the FCC would have 90 days to act, or the  
application is approved. The FCC, with majority approval, could get 
another 30 days to issue a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	To become law, the measure still would have to be approved by  
the Senate and House, and signed by the president. 
</P>
<P>

	The bill is S. 467

<HEADLINE> WTO Still Seeks Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The World Trade Organization tried to break a  
deadlock today on whether a former prime minister from New Zealand 
or his rival from Thailand should be its new director-general. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the two rivals met for the fourth time since  
Italy's Renato Ruggiero vacated the post last Friday, a year after 
he announced his intention to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	A prolonged leadership vacuum could damage the WTO's efforts to  
mediate high-profile trade disputes and prepare for a November 
summit in Seattle to lower barriers to exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Former New Zealand Premier Mike Moore looked set to win last  
week after the diplomat conducting the selection process ruled out 
Thai Deputy Premier Supachai Panitchpakdi. 
</P>
<P>
	But Supachai's supporters, led by Japan and the Association of  
Southeast Asian Nations, refused to concede defeat. Saying the 
consultation process was flawed, they questioned the authority of 
Tanzanian Ambassador Ali Mchumo to exclude a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Supachai supporters say more than 50 members of the 134-nation  
WTO are holding out for the Thai candidate. Kenya has proposed that 
Mchumo try to reach a consensus around Supachai. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore's supporters, which include the United States and many  
Latin American countries, said they still believe consensus around 
their candidate is possible and called for Supachai to withdraw 
with dignity. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know that any time with 134 members, it takes time to  
build consensus, and we are on our way,'' U.S. trade ambassador 
Rita Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO has appointed David Hartridge, head of its services  
division, as acting director, but only to handle routine matters.

<HEADLINE> House Nears Bankruptcy Bill Passage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House, seeking to stem rising personal  
bankruptcies, on Wednesday moved toward passing legislation pushed 
by credit card companies that would make it tougher for people to 
erase their debts. 
</P>
<P>
	The bipartisan bill has solid Republican support but has split  
the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House has objected to the bill without specifically  
threatening a veto. The administration especially has criticized 
the measure's creation of a ``means test,'' based on debtors' 
income, to determine whether they must gradually repay their debts 
or erase them entirely while under Bankruptcy Court protection from 
creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and Rep.  
John Conyers of Michigan, the panel's senior Democrat, tried to 
soften the means test provision, which uses the Internal Revenue 
Service's living expense standards to help determine how much 
debtors can repay. But their efforts were rebuffed in a 184-238 
vote against their amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting the massive lobbying push of the credit card companies,  
Hyde quipped during debate on the House floor, ``Let me pay my 
respects to the creditor lobby: They are awesome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conyers said the bill ``is bad for women, children, working  
Americans ... it is good for the credit card industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Big bank-owned credit card networks, notably Visa and  
MasterCard, and retail-business groups say their losses from 
forgiven debts in bankruptcy have forced them to raise interest 
rates for consumers who handle credit responsibly. 
</P>
<P>
	But consumer groups, unions, civil rights groups and bankruptcy  
attorneys maintain the legislation favors corporate profits over 
the needs of families struggling with debt who need a fresh start. 
They insist that the credit card companies share the blame by 
flooding consumers with mailed solicitations to entice them into 
easy credit. 
</P>
<P>
	By voice vote, the lawmakers adopted an amendment requiring  
credit card companies to clearly disclose their fees for late 
payments and how long it would take customers to pay off balances 
by making only minimum monthly payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies also would have to clearly reveal the expiration  
dates of introductory ``teaser rates'' and the higher interest 
rates replacing them. And the same disclosures would have to be 
made in offers for credit card accounts made over the Internet, 
which have attracted an estimated 7.8 million people in the last 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents also maintain that the bill, by barring certain credit  
card debts from being erased in bankruptcy, would force single 
mothers and children owed support by bankrupt fathers to compete 
with credit card companies in collecting debts. 
</P>
<P>
	But the measure's sponsors, led by Reps. George Gekas, R-Pa.,  
and Jim Moran, D-Va., say it gives highest priority among debts to 
child support and alimony payments, putting them ahead of credit 
card debt and other obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, bankruptcy overhaul legislation cleared the  
Banking Committee last month and went to the full chamber, but the 
key issue of providing information to credit card users remained 
unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers are responding to a rising tide of personal  
bankruptcies, which reached a record 1.4 million last year despite 
the strong economy, up more than 300 percent since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase is being driven by ``bankruptcies of convenience,''  
said Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va., a sponsor of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second straight year the House enacted bankruptcy  
overhaul legislation. Last year, the administration threatened to 
veto a House-passed bill and the Senate adjourned without voting on 
the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislative action has come amid an ongoing lobbying blitz  
by credit card companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Visa USA Inc. increased its lobbying bill to $3.6  
million from $900,000 in 1997, according to recent disclosure 
reports. MasterCard International's lobbying expenses rose to $1.8 
million from $430,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, people must repay  
their debts according to a court-ordered plan. Credit card 
companies complain that too many people take shelter under the more 
lenient Chapter 7, which erases debts, when they could afford to 
restructure debts under Chapter 13.

<HEADLINE> Hearing Set in NHL-Penguins Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A judge scheduled an emergency hearing for  
Tuesday morning on the NHL's request to fold, sell and move the 
financially troubled Pittsburgh Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	The league is using the prospect of losing the team as leverage  
to force its sale to its preferred buyer, former Penguins center 
Mario Lemieux. Broadcast.com founder Mark Cuban also is interested 
in buying the team. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz will review the league's  
plan and could send it to Penguins creditors for a vote, said Greg 
Cribbs, a team lawyer. That night, the Penguins will play Toronto 
at home in the third game of a best-of-7 playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
	During the hearing, Markovitz also could schedule votes on  
Lemieux's $50 million buyout and the NHL's plan for the same day, 
Cribbs said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The next full hearing in the case is June 24. But the NHL has  
asked for an earlier date, saying it needs to schedule the team for 
1999-2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Markovitz told lawyers on Friday, however, that the Penguins'  
case deserves no special attention and is just as important as 
about 1,000 other cases in Bankruptcy Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Penguins officials say they need resolution in the case so they  
can begin marketing season tickets, preparing for the draft and 
signing free agents. The team expects to lose $10 million this 
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- All-Americans Ossie Antonetti and Ryan Millar  
overcame intestinal illness to lead Brigham Young to a 10-15, 15-4, 
15-11, 15-4 victory over Penn State in the opening semifinal of the 
NCAA men's volleyball championship Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	In the oxther semifinal at UCLA's Pauley Pavilion, Long Beach  
State played Indiana-Purdue of Fort Wayne. The winners meet 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Top-seeded BYU (29-1) was led by Antonetti's 24 kills and  
Millar's 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Brigham Young coach Carl McGown said both players had been  
suffering Wednesday from ``intense intestinal distress'' and it was 
questionable whether they would play. 
</P>
<P>
	Brad Miller led Penn State (22-13) with 20 kills.  
</P>
<P>
	BYU's loss in the opening game of the match was only its third  
in its past 33 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cougars broke out to an 8-1 lead in the second game and an  
8-4 advantage in the third. The Nittany Lions responded with five 
consecutive points. After Millar's kill gave the serve back to 
Brigham Young, the Cougars regained the lead on Rich Lambourne's 
kill, eventually increasing their advantage to 12-9. Penn State won 
the next two points, but the Cougars closed the game with the final 
three points. 
</P>
<P>
	Brigham Young also got off to a fast start in the fourth game,  
8-1. Following two Nittany Lions points, the Cougars scored the 
next four for a commanding 12-3 lead, and closed it out.

<HEADLINE> Oriole Bird Mascot Injured by Fan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- One of the Baltimore Orioles' mascots is out of  
action after a run-in with a fan, a team spokesman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	John Crownapple, one of three people who dress up as The Bird,  
was injured when he was pushed off an outfield wall Tuesday night 
during the game against the Chicago White Sox, team spokesman John 
Maroon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore police said he suffered a broken ankle and had bone  
chips loosened in the other. 
</P>
<P>
	Louis Vitaglyano, 43, of Philadelphia was arrested and charged  
with second-degree assault and reckless endangerment, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses told officers that Vitaglyano shoved The Bird off the  
roof of the groundskeeper's shed at Oriole Park in the ninth inning 
as he was leading cheers in front of the stands. Crownapple fell 
onto the field, about 10 feet below. Maroon said Crownapple did not 
provoke the attack. He said the mascot's pranks against opposing 
players and mascots are nonviolent. 
</P>
<P>
	Crownapple is recovering at home. Maroon said the team is  
waiting to find out when he will be able to work again, but he 
cannot be replaced because of his specialized training and the 
difficulty of his routines. 
</P>
<P>
	Maroon said the other two people trained to portray the Orioles'  
mascot were filling in for Crownapple at games. But the team has 
canceled other public appearances by The Bird.

<HEADLINE> Source: Amy Fisher Granted Parole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- After spending nearly seven years in prison,  
the ``Long Island Lolita'' is being liberated. 
</P>
<P>
	A parole board has voted 2-1 to release Amy Fisher after nearly  
seven years in prison for shooting her lover's wife in the face, 
The Associated Press has learned. She is expected to be freed next 
week, according to a state official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fisher, 24, was interviewed by the panel Tuesday at Albion  
Correctional Facility in western New York. Division of Parole 
spokesman Tom Grant would say only that Ms. Fisher would be 
notified of the panel's decision today. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fisher was 16 when she shot Mary Jo Buttafuoco in the head  
at her home on New York's Long Island in 1992. Nicknamed the ``Long 
Island Lolita,'' Ms. Fisher was sentenced to five to 15 years in 
prison for first-degree assault. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge last month agreed to give her a shorter prison sentence,  
making her eligible for release. During a court appearance, Ms. 
Fisher took responsibility for the shooting and apologized to Mrs. 
Buttafuoco. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened to you -- it wasn't your husband's fault ... it  
wasn't my father's fault. It was my fault and I'm sorry,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Buttafuoco, whose husband, Joey, served six months in jail  
for statutory rape after the affair, said her faith in God allowed 
her to forgive the woman who seriously wounded her. The two 
corresponded for several months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buttafuocos now live in Los Angeles, where Joey Buttafuoco  
has been a cable television talk show host. The case inspired 
several television movies.

<TEXT>
<P>
	CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) -- Two brothers convicted of  
second-degree murder in a 1995 shooting will get a new trial 
because the judge held court on a Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Criminal Court Judge Doug Meyer ignored state law prohibiting  
courtroom proceedings on Sunday, the state Court of Criminal 
Appeals ruled unanimously, dismissing the brothers' convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers, Debiasi and Dewayne King, remained in custody  
after the appeals court April 30 ruling. An attorney for one of the 
brothers said he had no immediate plans to seek release. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1996 trial, the sequestered jury indicated they would  
like to continue through the weekend instead of taking a break, the 
appeals court wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Meyer said he was aware of the Sunday court prohibition but  
noted ``society had become much more tolerant of nonessential 
functions being performed on that day and decided to proceed,'' the 
court wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban must be obeyed unless the General Assembly or the state  
Supreme Court change the law, the appeals court wrote.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Ministers Meet Over Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- On the sidelines of President Clinton's  
visit, foreign ministers from western powers and Russia met today 
seeking agreement on the outline of a Kosovo peace plan that could 
be endorsed by the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting Russia, which opposes NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia,  
into such a common front could increase diplomatic pressure on 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to settle on NATO's terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow, a traditional Serb ally, appears to be moving toward  
supporting a key alliance demand: a NATO-led international force to 
secure the return of Kosovo refugees. Milosevic has so far refused 
to accept such an armed international force. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he was optimistic there will be an accord at the  
Group of Eight meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're getting closer,'' he said in an interview with  
European television correspondents in Frankfurt. ``I wouldn't be 
surprised if it happens today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic has shown no sign of giving in, but some of his  
maneuvers prompted speculation of a Yugoslav diplomatic offensive. 
</P>
<P>
	With Belgrade's permission, Kosovo's most prominent ethnic  
Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova, flew to Rome on Wednesday. Last 
weekend, Milosevic allowed three captured U.S. soldiers to be 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's meeting of G-8 foreign ministers at a government guest  
house outside Bonn is the first since NATO's assault began March 
24. 
</P>
<P>
	Represented are the United States, Britain, France, Germany,  
Italy, Japan and Canada -- the world's leading industrial countries 
-- and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met separately before the  
main session with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and his 
German counterpart, Joschka Fischer. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the talks, Western leaders praised mediation efforts by  
Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin, who has met twice with Milosevic 
since airstrikes began March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not least because of Chernomyrdin's mission, the key political  
positions have come closer together,'' German Chancellor Gerhard 
Schroeder said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Russia ``has shown an  
increased interest'' in helping solve the Kosovo crisis over the 
past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Ivanov said before leaving Moscow that no quick  
solution was in sight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not optimistic about a breakthrough,'' the ITAR-Tass news  
agency quoted him as saying. ``But if there is the slightest 
progress, this will be important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An aim of the talks is a U.N. mandate for any military force to  
protect ethnic Albanian refugees returning to Kosovo and to 
establish an interim administration for the Yugoslav province, Cook 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some European governments, including Germany's, are also under  
pressure to pursue diplomacy to head off growing antiwar sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The military means we are using are not an end in themselves,  
they are the means for a single purpose: ending the killing in 
Kosovo,'' Schroeder said in a speech to parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, on a two-day trip to Germany to meet U.S. military  
personnel involved in the airstrikes on Yugoslavia, stressed that 
the bombing will continue until Milosevic gives in. 
</P>
<P>
	But he softened his rhetoric this week after meeting  
Chernomyrdin, offering both a pause in NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia 
and negotiations on a U.N.-backed peace force for Kosovo if 
Milosevic starts pulling out his forces.

<HEADLINE> Track Reopens With NASCAR Testing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- With flags at half staff, Lowe's Motor  
Speedway returned to the business of racing, this time without any 
spectators in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	More than two dozen Winston Cup teams showed up for a test  
session Wednesday, four days after three spectators were killed and 
eight injured when struck by debris from a crash in an Indy Racing 
League event at the track. 
</P>
<P>
	The track had remained silent following Saturday night's  
accident, and speedway officials said they discussed calling off 
the two-day Winston Cup test booked by General Motors for its 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``We considered a variety of factors and decided to go ahead  
with the test, primarily because it is a non-spectator event,'' 
track spokesman Jerry Gappens said. ``We felt it was in everybody's 
best interests to move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With no fans sitting in the seats during the private test  
session, the Winston Cup drivers went out on the track early in the 
afternoon and began turning laps at about 180 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRL drivers were going about 35 mph faster than that  
Saturday night when a three-car crash sent a tire and suspension 
parts flying into the stands above the 1.5-mile, high-banked 
trioval. 
</P>
<P>
	The fatal wreck occurred near the exit of the fourth turn, and  
20 minutes into Wednesday's practice, Michael Waltrip crashed in 
almost the same spot. His Chevrolet spun violently through the 
third turn and slammed off the fourth-turn retaining wall, about 
200 yards from the site of the deadly crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip wasn't injured, but it served as an eerie reminder of  
recent events. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our hearts go out to the folks who lost their lives and their  
families and the people who were injured,'' three-time Winston Cup 
champion Jeff Gordon said as he prepared to go out for his first 
test run. ``But we know that Charlotte Motor Speedway, the IRL and 
really everybody in motorsports is going to come together and do 
whatever they can to improve the situation to make sure that 
doesn't happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday night's accident was the second in nine months  
involving multiple fan fatalities in U.S. racing. Both crashes 
occurred during Indy-car races when wheels and suspension parts 
snapped off cars and flew into stands. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel pretty fortunate in Winston Cup,'' Gordon said. ``With  
NASCAR rules, the way our cars are built, things like that are a 
little less likely to happen. But still we want to prevent anything 
like that. We want to keep the fans safe, we want to keep the 
drivers safe and make it a fun event for everybody to enjoy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only one of the eight injured people still hospitalized,  
Haley McGee, 9, of Conover, N.C., remained in critical condition at 
Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte with brain and lung injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second day in a row, speedway president H.A. ``Humpy''  
Wheeler attended a funeral for one of the victims, this time going 
to a service for Randy Pyatte, 21, of Connelly Springs, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Back at the track, engineers and architects moved closer to  
finalizing plans to modify the catch fence that surrounds the 
speedway. The fence now rises 15 feet above the track and is topped 
by a 35-inch-long canopy positioned at a 45-degree angle. Gappens 
said the speedway is looking at adding to both the height of the 
fence and the length of the canopy.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Slip Early / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar edged higher by late morning Friday  
despite some selling pressure following comments from U.S. Federal 
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. Japanese stocks slipped. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.56 yen at midday trading, up 0.08 yen from  
late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level 
Wednesday of 120.50 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average fell 122.45 points, or 0.71 percent, to  
17,178.16 points at the end of the morning session. On Thursday, 
the index rose 599.08 points, or 3.59 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On the foreign exchange market, the dollar initially inched down  
on Greenspan's comments Thursday that the U.S. jobless rate 
couldn't continue without leading to inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	That started a selloff in the U.S. bond market as investors  
demanded higher rates of return as protection against inflation. 
This in turn pushed down the dollar by raising concern that it 
could signal a trend away from U.S. assets, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dollar later drifted higher, although there was no major  
market-moving news ahead of the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 129.98 yen, down  
slightly from 130.00 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, investors took profits after Thursday's big  
jump in which the market registered its highest close since Oct. 
24, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoshihiko Kuroichi, a general manager at Meiko Securities said  
the Tokyo market ``went too high Thursday, this morning we are 
seeing some market correction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 0.96 points, or 0.07 percent, to 1,380.16 
points. The TOPIX rose 44.00 points, or 3.29 percent, Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average closed  
down 8.59 at 10,946.82 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.335  
percent from 1.330 percent late Thursday, pushing its price down to 
104.13 yen from 104.18 yen.

	Plan Drafted To End Kosovo Conflict  
</P>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- Russia and the major Western powers set  
aside their differences over NATO airstrikes today and drafted a 
joint plan to end the Kosovo conflict. The plan includes the 
deployment of an international force to keep the peace after the 
withdrawal of Yugoslav forces. Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic responded by reiterating his demand that Western powers 
stop airstrikes as a first step toward reaching any settlement. 
Milosevic did not reject the plan outright or refer to the call for 
foreign troops.

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Round-the-clock NATO bombing  
continued in Yugoslavia today. According to local reports, a NATO 
missile slammed into a residential area in Serbia's second largest 
city and allied jets struck a chemical plant. NATO also struck 
across Kosovo, where Serb forces continue to battle the ethnic 
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army. The attacks came as foreign 
ministers from Russia and the major Western powers, meeting in 
Germany, agreed on a draft plan for ending the Kosovo conflict, 
including the deployment of an international force to keep the 
peace after the withdrawal of Yugoslav forces.

	Bank Overhaul Bill Passes Senate  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate tonight passed legislation that  
would lift Depression-era barriers and let banks, securities firms 
and insurance companies get more deeply into each other's 
businesses. The mostly party-line vote was 54-44 on the bill, which 
faces a likely presidential veto. Proponents of the financial 
overhaul legislation, led by Wall Street and the insurance 
industry, maintain it is needed to keep the U.S. financial industry 
competitive in global markets and that it would save consumers 
billions by providing one-stop financial shopping.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House tonight approved $13.1 billion for

globe. The measure would more than double the $6.05 billion 
President Clinton requested last month to back the NATO air war 
through September and care for hundreds of thousands of refugees 
who have fled Kosovo. The additions include $1.1 billion to buy 
missiles and bombs, $1.3 billion for spare parts, $1.8 billion to 
improve troops' pay and pensions, and $1.1 billion to modernize 
military bases, mostly in Europe.

<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Two hundred state police swarmed through the  
hills of southern Chiapas state today in search of dozens of 
prisoners who staged a mass escape. The mass escape began Tuesday 
after rioting broke out at the 245-inmate prison. Escapees 
overpowered guards, stole firearms and used two female prison 
employees as hostages. They were later released. Local reports say 
five of the 77 escapees have been recaptured. The prison reopened 
in 1998 after being partially destroyed by leftist rebels. The 
rebels freed 180 inmates from the facility in that attack.

<HEADLINE> Cholesterol-Lowering Margarine Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Americans will soon be able to spread their food  
with two margarines that actually cut cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite costing four times the price of regular margarine,  
market analysts suggest many health-conscious Americans will bite. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be an easy sell,'' said Roland Rust, a marketing  
professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn. ``It sounds 
like a winner to me, because there are a lot of people looking for 
a magic bullet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, not quite.  
</P>
<P>
	``It can't do magic,'' said Connie Diekman, a registered  
dietitian in St. Louis and spokeswoman for the American Dietetic 
Association, stressing that they won't replace a careful diet and 
exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it appears these products are one more way to lower your  
blood cholesterol level,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Take Control, made by Unilever's Lipton unit, began hitting the  
market last week. Benecol, made by Johnson &AMP; Johnson, is nearing 
approval by the Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	They're among the first major foods that are designed to act  
like drugs. As a result, the companies plan to market them on two 
levels -- the traditional way through advertising, and also by 
convincing doctors to suggest them to patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Take Control sells for about $3.70 for a 10 ounce package.  
Benecol is expected to sell in the same range, though J&AMP;J has yet 
to release a price. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies say consumers will pay top dollar because of the  
growing awareness among Americans to control their cholesterol. 
More than one in three Americans have moderate to high cholesterol 
levels, a major risk factor for heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Lipton says Take Control is more expensive than regular  
margarine because of the high cost of extracting and processing the 
product's main ingredient, a natural soybean extract called plant 
sterols. 
</P>
<P>
	J&AMP;J spokesman Ron Schmid said Benecol's novel health benefits  
justify the higher price. Benecol's main ingredient, stanol ester, 
is derived from a substance found in pine trees. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Benecol and Take Control work by blocking the body from  
absorbing LDL, or bad cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
	A New England Journal of Medicine article last year showed  
regular use of Benecol could reduce cholesterol levels by 14 
percent. An article in European Journal of Clinical Nutrition 
earlier this year found Take Control could cut cholesterol level by 
7 percent to 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for dietary supplements and herbals remedies has soared  
in the past few years as many Americans have looked for cheaper and 
safer alternatives to prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans are snapping up those supplements even without major  
scientific studies supporting the bold health claims of the 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	Benecol will eventually also be available in cream cheese  
spreads and in salad dressing. Lipton won't disclose its plans.

<HEADLINE> Trainer: Kelly Kip Is Recovering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Kelly Kip, one of thoroughbred racing's top  
sprinters, was on his way to a full recovery from a serious leg 
joint infection, trainer H. Allen Jerkens said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The infection was considered career and perhaps life-threatening  
only a week ago. Kelly Kip was scratched from last Sunday's Carter 
Handicap because of the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Treatment at Dr. Dennis Milne's veterinary clinic has been  
successful, Jerkens said, adding the horse ``is OK. They had him 
out grazing and walking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No date has been set for Kelly Kip's return to his barn at  
Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
	In his last race, on April 10, the 5-year-old Kelly Kip broke  
his own Aqueduct record for six furlongs in winning the $100,000 
Bold Ruler Stakes by 2 1/2 lengths over Artax. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly Kip's time of 1:07 2-5 clipped 1-5 of a second off the  
mark he set on April 11, 1998.

<HEADLINE>  Okla., Kansas Assess Tornado Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- In her debris-littered front yard,  
7-year-old Megan Varva leaped across chunks of concrete and wood 
like a gazelle on an obstacle course. 
</P>
<P>
	``My outfit is new,'' she said proudly, tugging at her  
pink-and-white striped shorts set. ``My mom said I'm going to be 
getting about a new outfit a day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Megan's new wardrobe isn't a luxury. Her old clothes, like much  
of her neighborhood, lay twisted in the dirt after Monday's deadly 
tornadoes in Oklahoma and Kansas. The toll in the two states rose 
to 46 today with the deaths of three people overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to go in there,'' the first-grader said of what  
little was left of her house. ``It isn't nice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many in the twister-scarred southern Plains would agree. Their  
homes are now nothing more than a jagged nest of splintered wood, 
mangled furniture, shattered glass -- and broken dreams. 
</P>
<P>
	The big orange ``U'' spray painted along a wall of 9-year-old  
Sara and 5-year-old Rebecca Johnson's home in Haysville, Kan., said 
it all: Uninhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 3 inches of rain have poured in through the roof. The  
house must be inspected for structural damage before Dave Johnson 
and his daughters can even think of returning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just picking up the pieces,'' Johnson said Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Clifford Cunningham, 24, seemed to see a silver lining today as  
he surveyed the damage to the home where he lived with his mother 
and sister. ``This house was old anyway. At least I don't have to 
mow the yard now,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	All around Oklahoma City, cars -- some with smashed windows --  
lined up at police and National Guard checkpoints as families came 
to dig through the debris before an 8 p.m. curfew. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheryl and John Molsbee drove slowly past mounds of debris that  
obliterated neighborhood landmarks before finally pulling up to 
their brick-and-frame home. It no longer had a roof. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's worse than I thought,'' said John Molsbee.  
</P>
<P>
	Three injured people died overnight in hospitals, raising the  
death count to 41 in the deadliest tornado to hit Oklahoma since 
1947, said Ray Blakeney of the state Medical Examiner's Office. At 
least 748 people were injured. Blakeney said his office had 55 
missing person reports today, down from the 100 that were 
unaccounted-for Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the dozens of missing persons reports, John Long, chief  
of the public education office for the Oklahoma City Fire 
Department, said he didn't expect the fatality count to grow by 
that much. Rescuers have made at least three searches of each 
damaged home. 
</P>
<P>
	The tornadoes Monday also killed five in Kansas and injured  
nearly 150 people there. 
</P>
<P>
	More twisters swarmed across parts of Texas and Arkansas on  
Tuesday, killing one person. And late Wednesday, strong winds were 
blamed for several deaths in Tennessee as storms destroyed homes in 
dozens of counties and temporarily shut down Nashville 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	The damage estimate has been placed at more than $500 million in  
Oklahoma and more than $140 million in Kansas, where 1,129 
buildings were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	A disaster housing program through the Federal Emergency  
Management Agency will provide rental assistance for up to 18 
months, said Ben Frizzell of the Oklahoma Office of Civil Emergency 
Management. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those trying to get their lives together was Calvin  
Waters, a sheet metal worker in Haysville whose home was heavily 
damaged. He spent a second day trying to clear the debris, patch 
holes in the roof and mop up. 
</P>
<P>
	Waters called himself fortunate. He was shaken by the deaths of  
a woman and her month-old baby near his home -- two people he didn't 
know. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always think a child should get a chance to grow up,'' he  
said. ``If you have to take two people, don't take a baby child. 
Take me, I'm 44 years old.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has authorized emergency disaster declarations  
for both Oklahoma and Kansas, paving the way for federal emergency 
funds for home and business owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Anderson will likely need both forms of aid. Before a  
tornado destroyed his used motorcycle shop in Midwest City -- just 
outside Oklahoma City -- it stopped first in Moore, sucking up his 
home and leaving it a shattered pile of glass and metal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it hasn't sunk in yet,'' he said. ``Yesterday,  
I woke up and said it has to be a dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For hundreds of regional business owners, the nightmare has  
begun. 
</P>
<P>
	They must negotiate with insurance companies, hope for a fair  
and quick settlement, and eventually -- if they can manage it -- get 
back to business. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Silsby, an owner of a destroyed surplus store in Midwest  
City, tried to put a positive spin on things as he surveyed the 
wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday was the shock of, `I've lost everything,''' he said.  
``Now it doesn't matter. We can replace it.''

<HEADLINE> INS `Hubbing' Plan Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Immigration and Naturalization Service has  
proposed grouping illegal immigrants by nationality and shipping 
them to detention ``hubs'' in Texas and Chicago to await 
deportation hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say the proposal is racist and would demoralize  
immigrants, leaving them hundreds of miles from their families and 
support services they will need if they choose to fight 
deportation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost like the INS has forgotten they're people and not  
packages,'' said Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	The INS says the plan would be a cost-effective and efficient  
way to process detainees. Currently, illegal immigrants awaiting 
deportation are generally jailed in whatever part of the country 
they are arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan would encompass the 18 states in the agency's central  
region, relocating illegal Mexican, Central American and Caribbean 
immigrants to separate facilities in Texas. All other immigrants -- 
those from Europe, Asia and Africa -- would be shipped to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The INS says the plan is open to revision, although the agency  
would like to implement it early this summer. Detractors -- 
including the Congressional Hispanic Caucus -- believe the plan 
should be scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
	Gutierrez said he's concerned about immigrants' due process  
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do they ship your lawyer with you? Your witnesses? Your  
documents? All of your support network so you can have a fair 
hearing?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, an illegal immigrant from Honduras who is picked  
up in a workplace raid in Indiana would be sent to Dallas to await 
deportation or a hearing before an immigration judge. Today, such a 
case would be handled at the nearest INS facility, with the 
immigrant most likely detained at a county jail that contracts with 
the INS. 
</P>
<P>
	The INS says many detainees -- there are about 4,300 in the  
central region -- are convicted criminals who already have their 
deportation orders. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want these people near where we can quickly move them to  
their home country,'' said Brian Perryman, the director of the 
INS's district office in Chicago. ``A very small percentage of them 
are going to prevail even on appeal. Most of them are going out.''

Waters, a sheet metal worker in Haysville whose home was heavily

	Waters called himself fortunate. He was shaken by the deaths of  
a woman and her month-old baby near his home -- two people he didn't 
know. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always think a child should get a chance to grow up,'' he  
said. ``If you have to take two people, don't take a baby child.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Assembly Democrats Back Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- All California Assembly Democrats but  
one are endorsing Vice President Al Gore's White House bid, 
snubbing his chief rival for the nomination, Bill Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	The 46 Assembly members cited the attention Gore has lavished on  
California and Clinton administration policies. Since taking office 
in 1993, Gore has made nearly 60 visits to California. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, no other candidate has your experience nor your  
record of achievements,'' Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa 
wrote in a letter to Gore released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter listed the booming economy, falling crime and stiffer  
air and water quality standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The only Democratic Assembly member who did not back Gore was  
Dick Floyd. His office did not immediately respond to a request for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Wally Knox was not on the list of Assembly backers faxed out by  
the Gore campaign, but he said by telephone that he, too, likes 
Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's endorsements, which came 10 months before the  
primary, mirrored a similar gesture made in January by 25 
California Republican lawmakers on behalf of Texas Gov. George W. 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``With seven years of vice presidency, certainly the vice  
president is going to have major institutional advantages,'' 
Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser said. ``It would be surprising if it 
didn't, but it doesn't really change the way we go about our 
campaign.''

<HEADLINE> Oklahomans Return to Tornado Scene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- In her debris-littered front yard,  
7-year-old Megan Varva leaped across chunks of concrete and wood 
like a gazelle on an obstacle course. 
</P>
<P>
	``My outfit is new,'' she said proudly, tugging at her  
pink-and-white striped shorts set. ``My mom said I'm going to be 
getting about a new outfit a day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Megan's new wardrobe isn't a luxury. Her old clothes, like much  
of her neighborhood, lay twisted in the dirt after Monday's deadly 
tornadoes in Oklahoma and Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to go in there,'' the first-grader said of what  
little was left of her house. ``It isn't nice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many in the twister-scarred southern Plains would agree. Their  
homes are now nothing more than a jagged nest of splintered wood, 
mangled furniture, shattered glass -- and broken dreams. 
</P>
<P>
	The big orange ``U'' spray painted along a wall of 9-year-old  
Sara and 5-year-old Rebecca Johnson's home in Haysville, Kan., said 
it all: Uninhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 3 inches of rain have poured in through the roof. The  
house must be inspected for structural damage before Dave Johnson 
and his daughters can even think of returning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just picking up the pieces,'' Johnson said Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	All around Oklahoma City, cars -- some with smashed windows --  
lined up at police and National Guard checkpoints as families came 
to dig through the debris before an 8 p.m. curfew. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheryl and John Molsbee drove slowly past mounds of debris that  
obliterated neighborhood landmarks before finally pulling up to 
their brick-and-frame home. It no longer had a roof. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's worse than I thought,'' said John Molsbee.  
</P>
<P>
	Officials said 38 people died and more than 751 people were  
injured in the deadliest tornado to hit Oklahoma since 1947. The 
twisters killed five in Kansas and injured nearly 150 people. 
</P>
<P>
	More twisters swarmed across parts of Texas and Arkansas on  
Tuesday, killing one person. And late Wednesday, strong winds were 
blamed for several deaths in Tennessee as storms destroyed homes in 
dozens of counties and temporarily shut down the Nashville 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials had received about 100 missing persons reports in  
Oklahoma, but they were uncertain how many were duplicates. A 
master list of the missing was expected to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
	John Long, chief of the public education office for the Oklahoma  
City Fire Department, said he didn't expect the fatality count to 
grow by much. Rescuers have made at least three searches of each 
damaged home. 
</P>
<P>
	The damage estimate has been placed at more than $225 million in  
Oklahoma and more than $140 million in Kansas, where 1,129 
buildings were destroyed in Monday's storms. 
</P>
<P>
	A disaster housing program through the Federal Emergency  
Management Agency will provide rental assistance for up to 18 
months, said Ben Frizzell of the Oklahoma Office of Civil Emergency 
Management. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those trying to get their lives together was Calvin  
Waters, a sheet metal worker in Haysville whose home was heavily 
damaged. He spent a second day trying to clear the debris, patch 
holes in the roof and mop up. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Veggie Libel Law Stays in Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN (AP) -- The Texas House rejected an attempt Thursday to  
repeal the state's ``veggie libel'' law -- the law cattlemen used to 
sue television talk-show host Oprah Winfrey in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The repeal bill by Rep. Ruth Jones McClendon, a Democrat, was  
voted down 80-57. 
</P>
<P>
	While Ms. McClendon said the current law encouraged frivolous  
lawsuits and discouraged free speech, opponents said the law is 
needed to protect the state's agricultural industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Even dubbing it the ``veggie libel'' law trivializes a serious  
issue to agricultural producers, said Republican Rep. David 
Swinford. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes it sound silly. It's not silly,'' Swinford said.  
</P>
<P>
	The law allows producers to sue those who knowingly make false,  
disparaging statements about perishable agriculture products. 
</P>
<P>
	During an April 16, 1996 program on dangerous foods, Ms. Winfrey  
said England's bout with mad cow disease stopped her from eating 
another hamburger. Winfrey was quickly hit with a lawsuit that cost 
her up to $5 million to defend. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal jury ruled in Ms. Winfrey's favor.  
</P>
<P>
	Keeping the law will continue to have a chilling effect on free  
speech, said Republican Rep. Brian McCall. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't talk about broccoli without the fear that you'll  
have to defend yourself in a courtroom,'' McCall said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Dallas Cowboy Mark Tuinei Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLANO, Texas (AP) -- Mark Tuinei, a star offensive lineman for  
the Dallas Cowboys in the mid-1990s, has died, a spokeswoman for 
the Collin County medical examiner said today. Tuinei was 39. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of death was unknown, the spokeswoman said.  
</P>
<P>
	Tuinei, a two-time Pro-Bowler at left tackle, played 15 years  
for the Cowboys before he was released in April 1998 in a 
cost-cutting move. 
</P>
<P>
	He had played only six games in the 1997 season because of a  
sprained left knee and surgery to repair degenerating bone in his 
right knee. He had knee problems for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuinei came to the Cowboys in 1983 as a free agent from Hawaii,  
caught the attention of then-coach Tom Landry and played 10 games 
on defense. He moved to offense in 1985 and became a full-time 
starter in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	He played in the Pro Bowl after the 1994 and 1995 seasons.  
</P>
<P>
	Tuinei, 6-foot-5, played left tackle for more than a decade -- a  
crucial position, keeping opposing defensive lineman from sacking 
Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman. He played on three Super Bowl 
championship teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuinei was a major cog in an offensive line generally considered  
the best in the NFL in the mid-'90s, during the Cowboys' 
most-recent Super Bowl years. The line was among the best in 
allowing fewest sacks, and it also opened holes for Pro Bowl 
running back Emmitt Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mark has been an example to everybody on this team,'' Cowboys  
owner Jerry Jones said at the time Tuinei was released. ``He's 
played hurt at a really superhuman level, and obviously, we've had 
some great success during his career. He's been a remarkable 
player, a remarkable athlete. I don't know of anybody tougher, 
physically tougher, that I've ever been around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In college, Tuinei played his first two seasons at UCLA, where  
he was a starting defensive tackle his sophomore season. He 
transferred to Hawaii but due to injuries played only seven games 
his senior season.

<HEADLINE> Jefferson Reunion Adds Slave's Kin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- Guess who's coming to dinner at the  
Thomas Jefferson family reunion this year? 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, descendants of Jefferson's slave Sally  
Hemings will attend the annual gathering, which has been held at 
Monticello for the past 86 years. But a battle looms over whether 
the Hemingses will be fully accepted as Jefferson's kin. 
</P>
<P>
	The reunion will be the first one held since DNA test results  
last fall found that the author of the Declaration of Independence 
may have fathered at least one of Hemings' children. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of those findings, a white, sixth-generation scion of  
Jefferson plans to challenge his cousins to formally admit the 
Hemings descendants into their family organization, the Monticello 
Association, during their private meeting May 16. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see what the big deal is unless the big deal is  
racism,'' said Lucian K. Truscott IV, a best-selling author and 
member of the Monticello Association. ``They take my word that I'm 
a descendant and they don't take their word, despite the oral 
histories and DNA tests that back their claim. That's racist on its 
face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, it looks racist, but it's a genealogical question,''  
Monticello Association President Robert Gillespie countered. 
``We've got historical records. We need to go over some gaps in 
their genealogy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The genetic tests prove not that Jefferson was the father, but  
that a member of the Jefferson male line fathered a Hemings son. 
That leaves open the possibility that Jefferson's brother, 
Randolph, or one of Randolph's six sons, fathered a Hemings child. 
</P>
<P>
	Historians are using records of the whereabouts of the  
Jeffersons at the time of Hemings' pregnancies to determine 
paternity. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not ready to say yes, but we're definitely not saying  
no,'' said Gillespie, a lawyer from Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, Truscott urged Hemings descendants to crash the  
reunion. Then, last week, the Monticello Association sent the 
descendants invitations to the reunion dinner, which will be held 
at a historic tavern May 15, and a tour of Monticello, Jefferson's 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	Truscott said Thursday that 34 members of the Hemings family are  
coming. 
</P>
<P>
	``That really cracks open the door,'' Truscott said of the  
official invitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Truscott and some of the Hemings descendants said that a vote to  
unite Jefferson's presumed white and black descendants would help 
heal racial rifts in America. It was Jefferson who wrote that ``all 
men are created equal,'' yet he owned slaves and ignored 
accusations that he fathered a biracial child. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just our story -- it resonates for the whole  
country,'' said Dr. Michelle Cooley-Quille, a Hemings descendant 
and clinical psychologist at John Hopkins University who plans to 
attend the reunion. Her father was denied entry into the Monticello 
Association and denied burial at Monticello, a privilege accorded 
to all members, after he died last year. ``It's symbolic of what 
we've been denied but where we belong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 150 members of the Monticello Association are expected at  
the reunion, which is about normal attendance. Gillespie said a 
mail survey of all 700 members may be needed to decide whether to 
admit the Hemings kin into the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the DNA tests, the story of Jefferson and his slave had  
been passed down orally through the Hemings generations. Hemings 
was said to have become Jefferson's lover when he was ambassador to 
France in the late 1780s. In an interview in 1873, Hemings' son 
Madison claimed Jefferson was his father. 
</P>
<P>
	William Dalton, a great-great-great-great-great-great-grandson  
of Madison Hemings, said he is coming to the reunion so the 
Jefferson family can see what he sees every time he looks in the 
mirror and every time he looks at Jefferson's profile on the 
nickel. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can see the mix in me,'' said Dalton, a 34-year-old  
employee of a box company from Columbus, Ohio. ``The way our bottom 
jaws stick out, the pouty bottom lip. I'd like them to see my face 
when they make their decision on letting any Hemingses in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dalton said he is not angry at Jefferson for owning slaves and  
not acknowledging his paternity because ``he was a product of his 
own society.'' But he said the founding father's descendants ought 
to know better. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here's a good chance to heal a multicolored family,'' Dalton  
said. ``If they accept us as family, they will show America we can 
get along and it's not about color.''

<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- USA Today plans to begin running ads along  
the bottom of page one. 
</P>
<P>
	The one-inch tall ads will run the width of the page, the  
newspaper said Wednesday. The first will appear Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The space was recently offered to advertisers in one-year  
contracts. AT&AMP;T, Marriott and Northwest Airlines are among the 
clients that have committed to placing ads, the newspaper said. The 
ads for each company will run on one designated day of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	USA Today has an average daily circulation of 2.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	European newspapers often run advertising on their front pages.  
But American papers have not adopted the practice, although The New 
York Times has long run classified advertising of up to four lines 
on its front page.

<HEADLINE> Farmland, Cenex Plan To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Farmland Industries Inc. and Cenex  
Harvest States Cooperatives plan to combine the two agricultural 
cooperatives, creating an agricultural giant with $20 billion in 
annual revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Resolutions supporting the merger were approved by Farmland  
directors in Kansas City and by the Cenex board in St. Paul, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see complete consolidation as an important step for our  
member-owners in the rapidly changing global marketplace,'' 
Farmland chairman Albert Shivley and Cenex co-chairmen Gerald 
Kuster and Elroy Webster said in a joint statement Thursday. 
``Bringing Cenex Harvest States and Farmland together should 
provide greater opportunities for future growth and cost benefits 
that will position our farmer-owned system for success. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies hope to complete a study on the feasibility of  
the merger and receive required governmental approval by late this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Member information meetings would take place in early 2000,  
followed by a vote of the memberships of both cooperatives. The 
companies have tentatively set June 1, 2000, as a goal for 
completing the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said they hope to combine the two companies with  
minimal effect on employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmland and Cenex have been involved in separate discussions on  
combining their grain operations and their petroleum refining and 
pipeline businesses. The companies already have an alliance in the 
sales, distribution and marketing of petroleum and related products 
and another joint venture involving the manufacture of pet foods. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmland is the largest farmer-owned cooperative in North  
America with 1998 revenue of $8.8 billion in all 50 states and 90 
countries. When including Farmland's share of the sales of its 
affiliated businesses, sales were $11.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmland's business lines include crop production and crop  
protection products, livestock feeds, petroleum, grain processing 
and marketing, and the processing and marketing of pork and beef 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	Cenex is a cooperative system owned by farmers, ranchers and  
local co-ops from the Great Lakes to the Pacific Northwest and from 
the Canadian border to Texas. 1998 revenue was $8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Cenex also operates oil refineries and pipelines and provides a  
wide variety of products and services ranging from grain marketing 
to food processing.

<HEADLINE> Widow of Celtics Star Testifies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- After days of tests prompted by Reggie Lewis'  
collapse during a playoff game, team doctors broke the news to the 
Boston Celtics captain and his wife: The basketball star had a 
life-threatening heart condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was devastating,'' Lewis' widow recalled as she testified  
Thursday during the malpractice trial stemming from the player's 
death in 1993. ``Reggie had experienced excellent health up to that 
point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donna Harris-Lewis detailed the subsequent search for a second  
opinion that led her to Dr. Gilbert Mudge, a highly respected 
Boston cardiologist. Mudge eventually discounted the potentially 
career-ending diagnosis of heart arrhythmia and told Lewis he had a 
less serious neurological condition that causes fainting spells. 
</P>
<P>
	Three months later, Lewis collapsed and died while practicing  
jump shots at Brandeis University. He was 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis sued Mudge and two doctors who consulted on the  
case, Mark Creager and Peter Friedman, claiming they misdiagnosed 
and mistreated Lewis' condition. A third consultant settled with 
Harris-Lewis for an undisclosed amount. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge has said he was unable to diagnose Lewis properly because  
he lied about cocaine use. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, under questioning by her lawyer, Robert Harley,  
Harris-Lewis denied her late husband ever used illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was totally against it,'' she said, adding that having  
grown up in rough neighborhoods -- she in Bridgeport, Conn., and 
Lewis in Baltimore -- both had seen lives destroyed by drugs. ``It 
wasn't part of our lifestyle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After collasping during a playoff game against Charlotte in  
1993, Lewis was diagnosed with arrhythmia and told he might need to 
wear a pacemaker. 
</P>
<P>
	The unexpectedly dire news, along with Harris-Lewis' displeasure  
at the way the doctors seemed to be keeping the couple in the dark 
while releasing information to the media, led her to seek advice 
from a friend at Brigham and Women's Hospital. He recommended 
Mudge. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis recalled how after getting the referral, Lewis  
stripped off the heart monitors attached to his chest and left New 
England Baptist in the middle of the night for a meeting with 
Mudge. 
</P>
<P>
	The cardiologist initially agreed with the arrhythmia diagnosis,  
Harris-Lewis said. But after ordering further tests, he revised his 
opinion and told Lewis he suffered from neurocardiogenic syncope -- 
and could, in all likelihood, return to professional basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were obviously happy,'' Harris-Lewis recalled. Her lawyer  
then asked if she believed the advice and trusted Mudge. She 
answered yes to both questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis, who met Lewis when both were students at  
Northeastern University, is suing to recover money he would have 
made had he lived, estimates of which have ranged from $40 million 
to more than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the doctors have suggested the Lewises had incentive  
to lie about drug use, including the Celtics' contract and 
insurance policy that would have been nullified by such activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis, who lives in the Boston area with her 6-year-old  
son and 5-year-old daughter, is scheduled to resume her testimony 
Friday morning in Suffolk Superior Court.

	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- American Honda Motor Co. Inc. has picked  
eastern Alabama for the site of its third U.S. auto production 
plant and said today it will hire up to 1,500 people to build 
either minivans, sport utility vehicles or both. 
</P>
<P>
	American Honda executive vice president Tom Elliott said the  
plant was vital because sales of light trucks, such as minivans and 
sport utility vehicles, are expected to exceed half of all U.S. 
auto sales by next year. Honda's Odyssey minivan and SUVs are 
strong sellers, Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Government and private groups have committed $102.7 million in  
incentives to purchase the land and get the site ready for 
construction as well as putting together training programs for 
employees. In addition, Honda will receive $55.6 million in tax 
breaks, according to the governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
	The $400 million, 1.7 million-square-foot plant is being built  
at the Talladega County community of Lincoln, about 35 miles east 
of Birmingham. Illinois, Georgia and Virginia were reported to also 
have been in the running. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction is to begin in mid-2000 and production is scheduled  
to begin in the spring of 2002. Full capacity is expected to be 
reached in 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to vehicle production, the Alabama plant will make  
V6 engines. Honda already makes cars at two plants in Ohio, where 
the company also has an engine plant. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second international automaker to pick Alabama for  
production. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, Alabama offered $253 million in tax breaks and other  
incentives to lure what is now DaimlerChrysler AG to Vance, a 
community about 30 miles west of Birmingham. The first 
Mercedes-Benz plant in the United States now has 1,700 employees 
and makes the M-Class sport utility vehicle.

<HEADLINE> New Africa Investments Execs Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- One of South Africa's largest  
publicly traded companies managed by blacks, New Africa Investments 
Ltd., has been rocked by the resignation of its two co-founders. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman Nthato Motlana and Jonathan Sandler, the executive  
director, said late Wednesday they would leave May 11. 
</P>
<P>
	The departures, following turmoil over attempts to grant share  
options to the executives, were a setback to South Africa's efforts 
to give blacks more economic control. 
</P>
<P>
	The exit of Motlana and Sandler -- high profile proponents of  
encouraging black entrepreneurship -- followed increasing 
dissatisfaction among New Africa's shareholders with the company's 
management style and its efforts to boost the group's flagging 
stock price. 
</P>
<P>
	Matters came to a head two weeks ago when Motlana, Sandler and  
fellow executive directors Dikgang Moseneke and Zwelakhe Sisulu 
tried to give themselves share options worth 130 million rand 
($21.3 million) in subsidiary African Merchant Bank Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Minority shareholders rebelled at what they saw as an  
unjustified equity grab, and a proposed resolution granting the 
shares was jettisoned just before to a general meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	New Africa said late Wednesday that it ``made changes to its  
executive committee to better focus the company's resources on its 
current and future business interests, while improving its 
relationships with its shareholders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from the resignations of Motlana, a one-time physician to  
President Nelson Mandela, and Sandler, New Africa said Moseneke and 
Sisulu, the remaining executive directors, have agreed to 
renegotiate their salary packages. 
</P>
<P>
	The move appeared to be an attempt to correct the impression  
that black enrichment was overshadowing efforts to build black 
empowerment. 
</P>
<P>
	In a further attempt to distance itself from accusations of  
greed, Motlana's and Sandler's indirect equity interests in New 
Africa will be taken over by separate trusts to be established with 
funding from subsidiary Hollard Insurance Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair founded New Africa in 1993 and listed it on the  
Johannesburg Stock Exchange a year later. It currently commands a 
market capitalization of almost 10.5 billion rand ($1.72 billion) 
and has substantial interests in insurance and retail and merchant 
banking. 
</P>
<P>
	In The Sowetan newspaper Thursday, Motlana blamed ``the white  
media'' for his downfall. 
</P>
<P>
	New Africa ``is a black-owned company has been a success story,  
and this is the reason why some white establishments do not like 
it,'' he was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Barnesandnoble.com Plans IPO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Barnesandnoble.com is going ahead with plans for  
an initial public offering of stock despite signs that Wall 
Street's frenzy for Internet-related businesses may be waning. 
</P>
<P>
	The online retailer -- jointly owned by bookseller Barnes &AMP; Noble  
and German media conglomerate Bertelsmann -- said Thursday that it 
hopes to raise about $300 million in the IPO, selling 25 million 
shares, or about 18 percent of the company, for about $12 each. A 
date for the offering hasn't been set. 
</P>
<P>
	The money will help the New York-based company in the fierce  
battle for market share against Amazon.com and the swarms of 
smaller outfits vying for a piece of the burgeoning online 
retailing business. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks, especially IPOs, have been the darling of Wall  
Street for the past year, with investors embracing just about any 
company with online operations or even online plans. Many IPOs have 
doubled in the first days of trading and kept on going. 
</P>
<P>
	But this may not be the right time to take an Internet company  
public. For example, the online real estate firm Comps.com sold 
shares earlier this week for $15 each, but had fallen to $13.50 by 
Thursday afternoon on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Internet ``stalwarts'' such as Amazon.com and eBay  
have slumped recently as investors shifted away from high-flying 
technology issues in favor of long-neglected industrial companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, the euphoria for Internet stocks is a little  
overdone,'' said Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at 
George K. Baum &AMP; Co., in Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, it is safe to say that barnesandnoble.com has a better  
name than an unknown xyz.com company,'' he said. ``But this market 
is still oversaturated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some analysts say that barnesandnoble.com's IPO may do  
well merely because it is a well-known name and investors have long 
liked the online-bookselling concept. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the last week, we've seen some lower quality IPOs,'' said  
Linda R. Killian, who evaluates IPOs for Renaissance Capital Corp. 
``These companies aren't unique in any way. Barnesandnoble.com is 
not like those.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like many online companies, barnesandnoble.com is a  
fast-growing, but money-losing business. 
</P>
<P>
	In reporting its IPO plans to the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, the company said it lost $20.2 million in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales, however, rose to $32.3 million, an increase of 25 percent  
from the fourth quarter of 1998 and up 259 percent from year-ago 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The online bookseller also said it now has 1.7 million  
customers, with more than 450,000 shopping for the first time 
during the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	But barnesandnoble.com still lags behind Amazon.com, which is  
quickly building itself into an online shopping hub with a broad 
array of books, music, video, gifts and auctions. Amazon's customer 
tally was 8 million customer at the end of the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnesandnoble.com stock will trade under the symbol ``BNBN'' on  
the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second time in a year that plans have been announced  
to sell shares of barnesandnoble.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Last August, Barnes &AMP; Noble announced its intention to take its  
online operation public, but decided to postpone the offering after 
Bertelsmann purchased a 50 percent stake in the company.

<HEADLINE> Senate Hears About IOC Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The senior Olympic official in the United  
States made her first monthly report to Congress today on reform 
efforts triggered by the Salt Lake City scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Anita DeFrantz, an International Olympic Committee vice  
president from Los Angeles, briefed members of the staff of Sen. 
John McCain, who had requested the regular reports following a 
contentious Commerce Committee hearing last month. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz explained the organization of IOC 2000, an 80-member  
task force that will recommend changes in the Olympic committee's 
membership and rules, and on plans for the IOC's next general 
assembly in June, according to Commerce Committee spokeswoman Pia 
Pialorsi. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senator McCain still has grave concerns about the reform  
process,'' Pialorsi said. ``But we do not want to prejudge the 
IOC's actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said the committee staff ``greatly appreciated'' the  
information DeFrantz supplied. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain has requested similar updates from IOC president Juan  
Antonio Samaranch and U.S. Olympic Committee president Bill Hybl. 
It was not known if they had submitted their first reports to the 
senator as well. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain has threatened to press legislation affecting the IOC's  
rich American sponsorships unless the panel takes strong action to 
change from the clubby culture that led to the Salt Lake scandal, 
the worst in Olympic history. He had grilled DeFrantz and another 
American IOC member, James Easton, at a Capitol Hill hearing last 
month, and said he did not feel the IOC took the need to reform 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	The senator was quoted in Thursday's Washington Post as saying  
recent IOC moves were ``not encouraging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC this week closed the case against the highest ranking  
official implicated in the scandal, executive board member Kim 
Un-yong of South Korea, and ordered further investigation of 
allegations against another top-level member, Phil Coles of 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Samaranch filled the IOC 2000 panel with 80 people  
-- four times the number originally planned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure how an organization can function effectively with  
that large a number of people,'' McCain told the Post. ``It's not a 
reason to have a lot of confidence.''

<HEADLINE> Payton Tapes PSA on Organ Donations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Former Chicago Bears tailback Walter Payton, who  
is suffering from a rare liver disease and needs a transplant, 
taped a public service announcement today promoting organ donation. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad will run during CBS's ``Touched By an Angel'' on May 16,  
said Pam Gorode, a spokeswoman for CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the theme of that night's show will be organ donation.  
</P>
<P>
	``Walter didn't want to do something that came off sounding  
self-serving,'' said Ginny Quirk, vice president of Walter Payton 
Inc. ``This gave him the opportunity to talk about the need for 
organ donation in a more general way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quirk said a CBS crew taped the spot at Payton's suburban  
Chicago offices because he does not feel good enough to travel. 
</P>
<P>
	In the brief ad Payton discusses the importance of organ  
donation and provides the number to an organ donation organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Payton, 44, announced in February that he needed a liver  
transplant because he had primary sclerosing cholangitis. He was 
placed on the transplant list at Mayo Clinic a few weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
	Payton said Thursday he will undergo a battery of tests at Mayo  
in the next few weeks that he hopes will move him up on the donor 
list. 
</P>
<P>
	In terms of his physical condition, Payton said, ``Some days are  
better than others. You wake up every morning and it's sort of like 
life -- you don't know how you are going to feel.''

	Severe storms pounded across the Southeast today, while clear  
and dry conditions prevailed over the far West. 
</P>
<P>
	A line of deadly storms struck western Tennessee early today,  
destroying homes, grounding flights and damaging buildings in 
several counties. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain and thunderstorms were expected through the day from the  
upper Ohio Valley down through the Tennessee Valley and central 
Gulf Coast states. Some of the storms could pack 70 mph winds, 
large hail and possibly tornadoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Steady rain and scattered storms were also forecast for the  
Great Lakes, western Pennsylvania and mid-Atlantic states. 
</P>
<P>
	Look for variably cloudy skies in New England, with a chance of  
showers in the southern part of the region by evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Skies should be mostly cloudy from the Dakotas and Minnesota  
down to Arkansas, with clouds decreasing from the west towards 
evening. Scattered showers were possible. 
</P>
<P>
	A system moving into the Pacific Northwest should spread clouds  
and rain into Washington, Oregon and northern California. Up to six 
inches of mountain snow could accumulate in Washington. The rest of 
the West should be fair and dry.

<HEADLINE> Religion in the News  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- Jews in the U.S. military have faced  
bigotry and anti-Semitic remarks, but a rabbi who is a longtime 
naval chaplain concludes in a new book that such intolerance in the 
ranks is the exception. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Albert Isaac Slomovitz says he is not trying to hide  
anything in ``The Fighting Rabbis.'' The book recounts examples of 
prejudice, such as a rabbi withdrawing as the main speaker for a 
World War II cemetery dedication when other chaplains threatened to 
tell Christian troops to stay away. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Slomovitz said in an interview: ``What I found was that  
quite often the military was ahead of society in terms of 
recognizing people on merit as opposed to race, religion, or creed, 
or something else. I suggest that the military, as an institution, 
was a counterbalance to societal hatred.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The image of an anti-Semitic military is one of two major  
stereotypes Slomovitz challenges in his book. The other is that 
Jews shunned military service. 
</P>
<P>
	He cites records showing about 250,000 Jewish-Americans served  
in World War I and 550,000 in World War II. Many who fought in 
World War I emigrated from Russia where the Czarist army made 
military service unpopular by conscripting 12-year-olds. In the 
U.S. military, a disproportionate number of Jewish members were not 
conscripted, but enlisted. 
</P>
<P>
	``They go back across the Atlantic, end up in France,'' he said.  
``I just found that amazingly fascinating, showing really their 
allegiance to this land of opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slomovitz, 48, chief chaplain at Pensacola Naval Air Station,  
said few people, including Jews, are aware of Jewish Americans' 
military heritage. The book, published this year by the New York 
University Press, began as his dissertation for a Ph.D. in ethnic 
history from Loyola University in Chicago, a Roman Catholic 
institution. 
</P>
<P>
	Slomovitz grew up in North Miami Beach and earned a bachelor's  
degree from Columbia University. He took night classes for his 
master's and doctorate at Loyola while stationed at Great Lakes 
Naval Training Center through 1995. He plans to retire this summer 
in Atlanta and wants to write another book focusing on 
Jewish-Christian relations. 
</P>
<P>
	Books about the experiences of Jewish chaplains have been  
published before, but Slomovitz is the first to write a 
comprehensive history. 
</P>
<P>
	He traces Jewish-American military history to 1655, when Jews  
demanded the right to join the New Amsterdam militia, to recent 
years, when Christian as well as Jewish clergy stationed in Saudi 
Arabia were called ``morale officers,'' not chaplains, to avoid 
offending their Muslim hosts. 
</P>
<P>
	Jews served in the American Revolution but had no chaplains  
until the Civil War when Congress changed a law that permitted only 
Christians to serve in that capacity. The South had no chaplains, 
but civilian clergy, Christian and Jewish, ministered to 
Confederate troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-four rabbis served in the Army and one in the Navy during  
World War I. They included Chaplain Elkan Voorsanger, who was 
called ``The Fighting Rabbi.'' He enlisted as a medic and remained 
in the trenches as a chaplain when Congress authorized additional 
positions for military clergy. 
</P>
<P>
	In World War II, 311 rabbis served, and six lost their lives.  
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Alexander Goode and three other chaplains -- two Protestant  
and one Catholic -- died when they gave their life jackets to other 
soldiers after a German submarine torpedoed a troop ship. 
</P>
<P>
	Jewish chaplains and soldiers also helped save thousands of  
Holocaust survivors. They moved them to safe areas and in one 
instance forced farmers at gunpoint to slaughter cattle so victims 
could be fed. 
</P>
<P>
	The rabbis, however, could not have accomplished their work  
without the cooperation of their Christian colleagues, Slomovitz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That epitomizes what the chaplaincy, and what the book, is  
about: That people of varying faith orientations could get along, 
help each other, not only without losing their faith but maybe 
enhancing it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said chaplains of all faiths fight for everyone's religious  
needs and help troops with personal problems regardless of creed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's ironic in a way,'' Slomovitz said, ``that in the midst of  
an institution whose purpose is to fight war, you have people who 
really are making peace with each other and cooperating.''

<HEADLINE> Alleged Cop Torture Victim on Stand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Haitian immigrant Abner Louima told a jury  
Thursday that police officers who arrested him in 1997 took turns 
beating him before one sexually brutalized him with a stick in a 
police station bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	The enraged officer rammed the stick up Louima's rectum and then  
jammed it in Louima's mouth, he said in a halting voice at the 
federal trial of five white officers charged with violating his 
civil rights. The incident prompted demonstrations against police 
brutality and inflamed racial tensions in the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking the stand on the third day of the trial, Louima at one  
point was asked to rise and identify the officer. He slowly scanned 
the courtroom before pointing at Officer Justin Volpe. Louima's 
finger shook visibly; Volpe sat expressionless. 
</P>
<P>
	After the attack, Louima testified, Volpe warned Louima that if  
he ``ever talked to anyone about what they did to me, he'd kill me 
and my family and he was not joking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe is one of four officers charged with beating Louima after  
mistakenly thinking he had sucker-punched Volpe as police tried to 
disperse a rowdy crowd outside a Brooklyn nightclub on Aug. 9, 
1997; a fifth officer is charged with covering up the assault. 
Prosecutors revealed this week that Louima's cousin was the man who 
punched Volpe. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe also is accused of sodomizing Louima in a fit of rage.  
Louima was hospitalized with severe internal injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Louima, 32, the government's star witness, slipped  
into the courtroom unobtrusively, wearing an oversized, dark blue 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Under questioning by Assistant U.S. Attorney Alan Vinegrad,  
Louima said his night began quietly. He described leaving his 
security guard job early, stopping at his parents' house and then 
joining his brother, cousin and friends for an outing to a popular 
nightspot, Club Rendezvous. 
</P>
<P>
	As the club closed and a large crowd spilled onto the street at  
about 4 a.m., Louima said, he noticed an injured man surrounded by 
police. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was one guy who had some blood on his face and was  
complaining that he got hit by a cop,'' Louima testified. 
Bystanders grew angry, he continued, and ``I was very angry, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Louima said he commented that police are ``not supposed to hit  
the person because they have rights.'' After that, he heard someone 
behind him say, ``Shut up,'' then felt himself being knocked to the 
ground and handcuffed. 
</P>
<P>
	Louima described being taken away in a patrol car to a nearby  
intersection where four white police officers -- identified earlier 
by prosecutors as Volpe, Thomas Bruder, Thomas Wiese and Charles 
Schwarz -- began pummeling him. One, he said, taunted him: ``Stupid 
nigger. I'm going to give you a lesson on how to respect a cop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following a second beating by two of the officers, Louima said,  
he was taken into the stationhouse, where one officer -- identified 
by Schwarz by prosecutors -- removed Louima's belt, the witness 
said. With his pants down at his knees and his hands still cuffed, 
the officer led him into the bathroom with Volpe following behind, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Louima said he noticed Volpe grab something near a trash can  
before being tossed face down near a toilet. Volpe kicked him in 
the groin, and then the mouth when he started to yell, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Louima also testified that he lied to reporters when he said  
that an officer had said ``It's Giuliani time,'' a reference to the 
law-and-order policies of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. He said two men 
who visited him at the hospital had told him to make the statement 
to attract attention. 
</P>
<P>
	In opening statements earlier in the week, Volpe's attorney,  
Marvyn Kornberg, said Louima had 150 million reasons to lie about 
the entire incident -- one for every dollar in his civil claim 
against the city.

<HEADLINE> Star Wars Buzz Hits Warp Speed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Now that a few people have actually seen the  
new ``Star Wars'' movie in special screenings, the hype has yielded 
to the buzz. And the buzz is ... well, don't expect a masterpiece, 
just a really good movie with cool special effects. 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, a certain summer blockbuster.  
</P>
<P>
	``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' was screened  
Tuesday night in eight North American cities for movie theater 
executives, their families, and -- apparently -- a bundle of ``Star 
Wars'' fans who somehow finagled some of the prized tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost immediately, early reviews hit cyberspace, followed by  
the reactions to the reviews, then the reactions to the reactions, 
along with all manner of claims, counterclaims, insults and 
soul-searching over the film, which opens nationwide May 19. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys, it's a movie!'' responded Tom Sherak, distribution head  
of 20th Century Fox, which is releasing the film for George Lucas. 
``It isn't the Bible! It's fun, it's enjoyable, it's escapism. But 
it's a movie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Uh huh.  
</P>
<P>
	In what was titled, ``What I believe to be the FIRST review  
anywhere on the Internet,'' Ronald Epstein wrote on his Home 
Theater Forum Web site (www.hometheaterforum.com) that while he was 
impressed, the movie may not satisfy hard-core ``Star Wars'' fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like 'Star Wars,' it smells like 'Star Wars' and it  
feels like 'Star Wars.' However, is it a 'Star Wars' that we are 
going to walk away satisfied with? Well ... perhaps, but not for 
everyone,'' Epstein wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	While the early amateur critics loved the action sequences and  
most of the effects, including what they found to be an incredible 
underwater sequence, some reviewers thought the 2-hour-plus movie 
dragged a bit in places, that it was a little too kid-oriented and 
that one of the computer-generated characters, Jar Jar Binks, was 
annoying. 
</P>
<P>
	Such views, however, were quickly countered by those who, like  
Jerry Rhoades on Home Theater Forum, found the movie to be 
``PHENOMENAL!!!!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't watch it to analyze and match other people's reviews and  
thoughts to the film, just sit back, relax and enjoy the ride,'' he 
said. ``I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a leading ``Star Wars'' Web site, www.theforce.net, a writer  
using the nickname BetterJedi wrote, ``Wow! What a film. I'm going 
to have to see it about 10 or 15 times to take it all in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But another writer, going by Job21, wasn't as impressed. ``It  
was a dream come true at first but quickly turned into a 
nightmare,'' Job21 said. 
</P>
<P>
	That was countered by a fuselage of reaction from fans, many of  
whom raised doubts about whether Job even saw the movie, pointing 
out his review noticeably lacked the kinds of details that would 
suggest he was there. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the theater operators themselves, they gave their usual  
tempered thumbs-up -- they praised the movie just enough to avoid 
losing any customers but not so much that Lucas could extract 
higher fees for showing the film. 
</P>
<P>
	The bottom line, financially, is the early buzz -- or for that  
matter the reactions from the professional critics who see 
``Phantom'' Friday night -- won't mean a thing initially, said Paul 
Dergarabedian, of box office tracker Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``This movie is critic-proof,'' he said. ``I think it doesn't  
matter what anybody says, good, bad or indifferent. The film is 
going to play big in those first two weeks without question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After that ... the Force only knows.

	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- A newly discovered audiotape  
suggests that someone tried to cover up key facts in the 1992 
bombing of the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires, the Israeli 
diplomat who was ambassador at the time of the blast said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The tape purportedly contains an order from a police officer  
redirecting a patrol car away from the embassy area just before the 
explosion, which killed 29 people. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with Israeli radio, Yitzhak Shefi alleged that  
the tape proved some Argentinian police officers tried to ``cover 
the facts'' and keep suspicion away from themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Interior Minister Carlos Corach said he has asked police to  
determine the authenticity of the tape, which was handed over by an 
officer to a congressional committee investigating the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	No suspects have been detained following the 1992 bombing.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- President Ernesto Zedillo has announced a  
$978 million anti-poverty program aimed at the 91 poorest regions 
in Mexico, to be implemented over the next three months. 
</P>
<P>
	The money is to be spent in providing health services, food and  
education to millions of Mexicans living in extreme poverty, news 
media reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico's economy has withstood international economic crises and  
continues to grow at rate exceeding that of more developed nations. 
But 40 percent of the country remains in poverty, never recovering 
from the economic crisis that broke out shortly after Zedillo took 
office in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1994-95 crisis, in which the peso lost half its value and  
interest rates soared, left millions jobless and unable to pay back 
loans

	Churches and parishes, mostly in rural parts of the country,  
have been affected, with altars stripped of religious images, said 
Monsignor Roberto Torruella, rector of La Merced Church in the 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the items stolen have been priceless objects dating  
backing back to colonial times. 
</P>

	Crime has surged in the Central American country since a 1992  
peace agreement ended its 12-year civil war.

<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Growing expectations that Japan may intensify  
efforts to repair its economy propelled the main Tokyo stock index 
3.59 percent higher today. The dollar rose against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.48 yen in late afternoon, up 0.90 yen from  
late last Friday in Tokyo but below its late New York level 
Wednesday of 120.65 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 599.08 points,  
or 3.59 percent, to 17,300.61 points -- its highest close since 
17,363.74 on Oct. 24, 1997. On Friday, the index lost 240.71 
points, or 1.42 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's rally came on the same day the Tokyo Stock Exchange  
began fully-computerized trading. The 120-year history of floor 
trading ended on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets in Japan were closed Monday through Wednesday  
for the nation's ``Golden Week'' holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said in Washington on Monday that he  
was determined to ensure a successful revitalization of the 
Japanese economy, which remains mired in its worst recession since 
World War II. Obuchi also held talks with U.S. President Bill 
Clinton at the White House on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are expecting more spending,'' said Tsuyoshi Nomaguchi,  
a strategist at Daiwa Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoshiro Mori, secretary-general of the ruling Liberal Democratic  
Party, has reportedly hinted at the need to increase public 
spending to boost growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must consider holding a session of parliament this autumn  
to handle substantial economic stimulus measures,'' Kyodo News 
service quoted Mori as saying on Monday. Mori is currently on a 
trip to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said buying from public funds also helped to lead the  
Tokyo market higher in the afternoon session. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 788  
million shares, up from Friday's turnover of 535 million shares. 
Advancing issues outnumbered retreaters 1,069 to 189, with 66 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 44.00 points, or 3.29 percent, to 1,381.12 
points. The TOPIX fell 10.52 points, or 0.78 percent, Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the dollar moved lower slightly from its level on  
Wednesday in New York on lingering expectation that any new 
economic stimulus steps from Japan could help boost its currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said, however, the dollar's losses were pared on  
short-covering after a spokesman for the prime minister expressed 
skepticism about reports on the new public spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Akitaka Saiki, spokesman for Prime Minister Obuchi told  
reporters that he was not sure if the news reports quoting Mori 
were accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 119.83 yen and 120.73 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 130.26 yen, up from  
126.86 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 212 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.330 percent from 1.420 percent late Friday, pushing 
its price up to 103.81 yen from 103.35 yen.

<HEADLINE>  Tagliabue Urges Support for Patriots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue urged area  
business leaders to purchase high-end seats and suites in order to 
help the New England Patriots build a new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody knows it's going to be difficult,'' Tagliabue told  
about 500 people today at the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce 
annual meeting and dinner. ``There will be suites that need to be 
purchased. There will be premium seats that need to be purchased.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue said a partnership between the NFL, state government  
and private investors is needed to make the stadium work. He cited 
stadium ventures in Buffalo, Detroit and Seattle as successful 
examples. 
</P>
<P>
	Apart from encouraging teamwork, Tagliabue mentioned no specific  
locations or deadlines for a new Patriots stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Meetings last month between Tagliabue, Gov. Paul Cellucci and  
legislative and business leaders preceded the collapse of a $380 
million stadium proposal in Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL has supported keeping the team in the Boston area, which  
has the nation's sixth largest television market; Hartford has the 
27th. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts lawmakers have proposed paying $70 million for  
infrastructure supporting a new stadium in Foxboro, the team's 
current home. But Patriots owner Robert Kraft would have to pay for 
the stadium, though it would be partly financed through favorable 
loans from the NFL.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Buys MediaOne for $54 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Now that AT&AMP;T Corp. has won a takeover fight to  
become the nation's largest cable TV company, a debate has begun 
over whether consumers also win. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T plans to offer its 16 million cable TV customers a broad  
array of telephone, Internet and TV services. It announced a deeper 
alliance today with computer software leader Microsoft Corp. to 
increase its orders for devices used to enable delivery of Internet 
and interactive TV via cable. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers will only need one cable into their homes, and will  
receive just one, lower-priced bill, AT&AMP;T says. 
</P>
<P>
	The ambitious strategy, however, is being criticized by consumer  
groups, lawmakers and competitors. AT&AMP;T, already the largest 
long-distance phone company, will stifle competition with its 
dominance of cable TV and high-speed, ``broadband'' Internet 
access, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	At the heart of the debate is AT&AMP;T's plan to spend $54 billion  
to acquire MediaOne Group Inc., the nation's fourth-largest cable 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	After weeks of high-stakes jousting, AT&AMP;T struck a truce late  
Tuesday with Comcast Corp., the No. 3 cable company, which had also 
sought to buy Denver-based MediaOne. Under terms of the pact, AT&AMP;T 
and Philadelphia-based Comcast will divvy up the cable TV customers 
of MediaOne. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Cooper, research director for the Consumer Federation of  
America, said the costs of the deal for consumers outweigh any 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``The costs are humongous in terms of the anti-competitive  
effects on cable and broadband services and the benefits of local 
phone competition are minuscule,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T's competitors aren't mincing words either.  
</P>
<P>
	Keep America Connected, a coalition backed by regional phone  
monopolies, took out a three-quarter page advertisement Wednesday 
in The New York Times calling AT&AMP;T's acquisition of MediaOne a 
``dangerous and aggressive plan to dominate the way Americans 
communicate to an extent no force, institution, company or person 
has ever been allowed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, for its part, claims it can save consumers 20 percent to  
25 percent off their cable and telephone bills. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based company plans to offer MediaOne customers  
combined cable, phone and Internet service early next year. The 
expanded service will include local, intrastate and long-distance 
phone calls, cable, and Internet access for a flat, monthly fee. 
Extra services, like call waiting and caller I.D., may also be 
included. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T said it may only charge customers between $4 to $6 for an  
extra line for a fax or computer, compared with the $17 charged by 
some phone companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more you buy from AT&AMP;T, the less it's going to cost you,''  
said C. Michael Armstrong, chairman and chief executive of AT&AMP;T. 
</P>
<P>
	But Armstrong will have to convince lawmakers that's a good  
thing. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., chairman of the House Commerce  
Committee's telecommunications subcommittee, which oversees 
telephone and television policies, is also concerned the planned 
merger would stifle cable TV competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Tauzin hasn't decide whether he will oppose the deal, but ``he's  
leaning against it at this point,'' said spokesman Ken Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Tauzin intends to ask the Federal Communications Commission and  
either the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission ``to 
take a hard look at this,' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Worries also have been voiced about the growing role of  
Microsoft, which is investing $5 billion in AT&AMP;T as it widens its 
Internet and telecommunications presence. AT&AMP;T stressed today that 
it still will deal with other software providers. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, AT&AMP;T's investors are betting that the company's  
chairman, who has proved a savvy negotiator in his deals with 
Comcast and MediaOne, will again prevail. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T's shares were rising further this morning after climbing  
more than 10 percent Wednesday. In early trading today, AT&AMP;T was up 
$2.81 1/4 at $59.75 a share on the New York Stock Exchange, where 
MediaOne's shares were up $2.50 at $79.37 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Comcast's common shares, which rose about 14 percent, on  
Wednesday, added 62 1/2 cents this morning to $37.25 a share on the 
Nasdaq Stock Market following a previously announced stock split 
that took effect today. Microsoft was up $1.50 at $80.62 1/2 in early 
Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Under AT&AMP;T's pact with Comcast, the two companies plan to  
exchange 2.7 million customers, giving each company a stronger 
presence in markets they have targeted for growth. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T will get 700,000 subscribers in seven markets, including  
Atlanta, Sacramento, Chicago and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Comcast will get 2 million subscribers in seven markets,  
including Michigan, New Jersey, Pennyslvania and Washington.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines To Fight Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Philippine Airlines will fight an  
attempt by the U.S. Export-Import Bank to seize Boeing jets used by 
the ailing flag carrier on its long-distance flights, a company 
lawyer said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Philippine Airlines lawyer Estelito Mendoza said the carrier  
will oppose the Ex-Im Bank's petition with a U.S. Bankruptcy Court 
to allow the seizure of the four Boeing 747-400 jumbo jets it 
helped the airline acquire. 
</P>
<P>
	PAL, Asia's oldest airline, has been unable to repay more than  
$2.2 billion in debt, owed largely to U.S. and European creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter Wednesday to Manila's Securities and Exchange  
Commission, the Ex-Im Bank said it began the recovery move after 
deciding PAL's financial rehabilitation process ``lacks fundamental 
attributes of transparency, fairness and predictability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a response Thursday to the Ex-Im Bank, SEC chairman Perfecto  
Yasay said the move violates the bank's earlier commitment to 
follow the SEC's jurisdiction in the airline's rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Yasay told reporters the Ex-Im Bank approved PAL's  
rehabilitation plan in March, thereby submitting itself to the 
SEC's jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Ex-Im Bank has complaints about PAL's rehabilitation  
process, it should bring a case to a court in the Philippines, not 
the United States, Yasay said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They should not act like a bully,'' Yasay said.  
</P>
<P>
	The four Boeing aircraft are used daily for PAL's long-haul  
flights, mainly to U.S. destinations, and their seizure would 
jeopardize the company's international flight operations, 
Philippine officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the Ex-Im Bank sought a U.S. court's help in  
recovering the aircraft after PAL failed to make payments on its 
debt. U.S. authorities subsequently seized two of the planes in Los 
Angeles and Hong Kong but returned them after airline officials 
appealed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ex-Im Bank and other major PAL creditors were displeased  
last week when businessman Lucio Tan, the airline's majority 
stockholder, reassumed active management control. 
</P>
<P>
	Tan, which holds a 70 percent stake, has had strained  
relationships with PAL's unions, and the creditors say they want 
the airline to be run by professional managers. 
</P>
<P>
	Yasay, however, said the Ex-Im Bank could not object to Tan's  
return to PAL's management helm because he has a right under 
Philippine laws to assume control of a company he owns. 
</P>
<P>
	Yasay said the Philippine government may temporarily take over  
PAL's management if Tan is unable to raise $200 million in new 
funds for PAL required under the rehabilitation plan by a June 4 
deadline.

	MIAMI (AP) -- Gloria Estefan will be the sole performer at the  
American Airlines Arena grand opening on New Year's Eve, and she 
promises to give a show ``the likes of which you've never seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a blowout,'' Ms. Estefan said Wednesday.  
``We're bringing unique things that haven't been seen before in a

<HEADLINE> Instinet Wants E-Trades Made Easy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Promising faster and cheaper stock trades,  
Instinet Corp.'s chief executive confirmed Wednesday the company is 
in talks seeking a partnership with a brokerage to allow ordinary 
investors to trade on the service. 
</P>
<P>
	Instinet would get a piece of the booming online trading market,  
while individual investors would gain benefits now almost exclusive 
to mutual funds, pension plans and other giant institutional 
investors -- more direct access to overseas and after-hours U.S. 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``A U.S. investor cannot get a trade execution in a foreign  
stock in anywhere near real time,'' Doug Atkin, chief executive 
officer of Instinet, said in a conference call from London. ``Even 
in the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq can sometimes take a 
long time,'' which can be expensive considering how the price of 
volatile stock can move 3 percent or more in just a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Atkin said the company is in talks with four or five ``blue chip  
players'' and hopes to work out a deal by yearend. 
</P>
<P>
	A report of Instinet's interest in such a partnership first  
appeared Wednesday in The Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	Faster, more direct execution of trades would get investors  
better prices, and would allow them to bypass more costly 
middlemen. Such ``captive'' market makers often are affiliated with 
or owned by a brokerage and may pay a brokerage to channel trades 
their way. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerns over such relationships and hidden fees have drawn  
criticism from the Securities and Exchange Commission about the 
quality of service Internet brokers give clients in carrying out 
trades. 
</P>
<P>
	While commissions paid to Instinet would be higher than the  
$9.95 charged by some discount brokerages -- perhaps up to $50 -- the 
total cost of trading through the Instinet service would actually 
be cheaper, Atkin said. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, he said, Instinet saved an eighth of a point, or  
12 1/2 cents, in the price of a share, a trade of 1,000 shares of 
stock would cost $125 less. Even if the commission was $40 more 
expensive than a competing online service, the Instinet investor 
still would come out $85 ahead in such a deal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The investor has to understand what goes on in the sausage  
factory,'' Atkin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instinet also would bring to the table the ability to give  
investors the ability ``with the touch of two or three keys'' to 
send orders to 43 foreign stock exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	Instinet is a New York-based unit of Reuters Group that  
pioneered after-hours trading, a field it still dominates. It also 
is the leader in handling institutional trading of shares listed on 
the Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> Recruiting of Census Workers Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Goodwill Industries will help the Census  
Bureau recruit temporary workers to count the nation next year. 
</P>
<P>
	A partnership with the national nonprofit organization was  
announced Wednesday by Census Director Kenneth Prewitt and Fred 
Grandy, president of Goodwill. 
</P>
<P>
	Among its programs, Goodwill conducts job training for people  
needing work and will now recruit these workers for Census jobs. It 
trained some 320,000 people last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This program will tap an underutilized pool of eager  
employees,'' Grandy said. ``Our graduates are skilled, reliable and 
ambitious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prewitt said he was ``thrilled this community-based agency will  
help us find some of the 850,000-plus workers we will need to 
conduct the census.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goodwill Industries helps people with disabilities and other  
needs by providing job training and placement assistance through a 
network of 185 local centers in the United States and Canada.

<HEADLINE> Australian Olympic Official Responds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- An Australian Olympic official, accused of  
helping Atlanta beat Melbourne in bidding for the 1996 Games, gave 
no extraordinary assistance to Atlanta organizers, a spokesman said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics in Australia want Phil Coles, a member of the  
International Olympic Committee and the Sydney Organizing Committee 
for the Olympic Games (SOCOG), to resign because of links to 
scandals that organizers say are damaging sponsorship and 
threatening ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta bid documents released last week included a letter from  
Atlanta board member Horace Sibley to Coles thanking him for ``your 
time and your advice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When reports of the letter hit Australia, criticism of Coles  
increased. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Walker, a member of Melbourne's bid, said that the ``heat''  
Coles is feeling is justice for his ``dalliance with Atlanta.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a pity that so many of us spent so much time  
pursuing the games for 1996 for Melbourne and we find that one of 
our number chose to help the other side,'' Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta officials say several IOC members received similar  
thanks after meeting with the bid team in 1988, two years before 
Atlanta was announced as the site of the 1996 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's safe to say all the IOC members provided good  
advice and counsel to all the candidate cities who were bidding for 
the 1996 Games,'' said Lee Echols, spokesman for the athletics 
foundation. ``Did he (Coles) give extraordinary help? Absolutely 
not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles says there's a conspiracy against him, possibly by members  
of Melbourne's failed bid. 
</P>
<P>
	In nine boxes of Atlanta Olympic documents released last week,  
The Associated Press found five similar letters Sibley wrote on the 
same day to other IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	All the letters contained similar thanks, and one other --  
written to Venezuelan IOC member Flor Isava-Fonseca -- mentions 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
	``You gave us some good advice and we will follow it,'' the  
letter to Ms. Isava-Fonseca said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sibley and former Atlanta Olympics chief Billy Payne did not  
immediately return calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the private group holding thousands of boxes of  
records detailing Atlanta's Olympic has gone to court rather than 
bend to pressure from Georgia's governor and attorney general to 
make the documents public. 
</P>
<P>
	The Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation filed suit asking for a  
ruling that the documents do not fall under the state's Open 
Records Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has been fighting to open the  
4,000 boxes of records. The newspaper says the public has a right 
to know if they contain evidence that Atlanta officials engaged in 
bribery akin to the scandal that has tainted Salt Lake City's bid 
for the 2002 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	In Atlanta, the athletics foundation sued Wednesday after  
Georgia Attorney General Thurbert Baker demanded the bid documents 
be made public. 
</P>
<P>
	``GAAF's steadfast refusal to make the documents available to  
the public ... lends credence to the belief that GAAF has something 
to hide,'' Baker wrote to Joseph Bankoff, the foundation's 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to Baker, Bankoff wrote, ``There is no shadow over  
the Games other than one manufactured'' by the 
Journal-Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	The athletics foundation, created by Payne in 1987 to bid for  
the Olympics, says the documents are the property of a group of 
private citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	But Baker says the records must be opened because Atlanta's  
Olympic efforts involved a partnership between government and 
private interests. 
</P>
<P>
	No evidence of wrongdoing was found in the nine boxes out of  
4,000 the foundation has voluntarily opened. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta officials have admitted to routinely exceeding the  
International Olympic Committee's $200 spending limit on gifts, but 
insist they did nothing wrong.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft, AT&AMP;T Form Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Deepening an alliance of titans of  
communications and technology, Microsoft Corp. said today it will 
invest $5 billion in AT&AMP;T Corp. and AT&AMP;T said it will increase its 
use of Microsoft's software. 
</P>
<P>
	The pact is designed to offer customers interactive TV, with  
phone service, e-mail and other Internet features -- all through one 
cable TV with one bill. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, which is becoming the nation's largest cable company, and  
Microsoft, the largest software company, will test the new service 
in three cities next year to find out what works and what consumers 
want. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to go to three cities and make it real and learn  
from it,'' said C. Michael Armstrong, chairman and chief executive 
of AT&AMP;T, who did not name the trial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement today follows AT&AMP;T's truce late Tuesday with  
Comcast Corp., which stopped a bidding war and paved the way for 
AT&AMP;T to acquire MediaOne Group Inc., the nation's fourth-largest 
cable company. 
</P>
<P>
	With the addition of MediaOne's cable subscribers, AT&AMP;T will  
control the cable connections to 25 million homes. AT&AMP;T has an 
existing agreement with Microsoft to buy software to power the 
set-top boxes that will control the new packages of services. 
</P>
<P>
	Under today's agreement, AT&AMP;T could double its purchases of  
Microsoft software to 10 million copies, giving Microsoft up to 40 
percent of AT&AMP;T's cable business. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies plan to deploy Microsoft's TV software, based  
on Windows CE, in one large city, and one suburban community. AT&AMP;T 
also plans a test in a third city that would use Microsoft's 
software for set-top boxes with another company's software for 
larger computers known as servers, which deliver services such as 
interactive entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	As speculation about such a deal has grown in recent days,  
worries have been voiced about the clout such an alliance could 
wield over basic communications services for consumers. But AT&AMP;T 
stressed that it is not ruling out similar agreements with other 
technology businesses, saying its arrangement with Microsoft is a 
``nonexclusive agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I've said 150 times, when you're in the networking  
business, the only way to make money is to carry the most 
traffic,'' Armstrong said. He added that AT&AMP;T doesn't want to get 
into the business of providing Internet directories, chat rooms, 
and home pages, saying ``We are open and welcome to commercial 
relationships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street cheered the deal. In early afternoon trading today,  
AT&AMP;T was up more than 9 percent on the New York Stock Exchange, 
rising $5.18 3/4 to $62.12 1/2 a share. Microsoft was up 43 3/4 cents at 
$79.56 1/4 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said it would buy $5 billion in AT&AMP;T securities that  
will be convertible into 66.7 million shares of AT&AMP;T stock. It also 
purchased the right to acquire an additional 40 million shares in 
three years. If it exercises all its options and winds up with 
106.7 million shares, it would own about 3.4 percent of AT&AMP;T.

<HEADLINE> Litton Offering To Buy Shipbuilders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Another defense industry mega-merger is on  
the table -- and Newport News Shipbuilding and Avondale Industries 
Inc. are in the thick of it yet again. 
</P>
<P>
	Litton Industries Inc. on Thursday offered to buy the two  
companies in a package deal valued at $1.76 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The unsolicited bid came less than a month after the Pentagon  
rejected General Dynamics' effort to acquire Newport News 
</P>
<P>
	Litton said the combination ``would create a worldwide leader in  
the shipbuilding industry and a full-service contractor with the 
ability to compete across the spectrum of the U.S. Navy's 
shipbuilding needs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company would have revenues of about $7.4 billion  
and more than 58,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodland Hills, Calif.-based Litton offered a tax-free,  
stock-for-stock deal for Newport News Shipbuilding. Each share of 
the Newport News, Va-based company would be converted to .55 Litton 
shares, valuing the deal at $1.26 billion based on Thursday's 
closing stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avondale offer is for $38 per share, or $504 million, in  
cash. The combined offer also includes another $600 million in 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans-based Avondale and Newport News Shipbuilding already  
were preparing to merge when General Dynamics made its offer for 
the Virginia yard in February. 
</P>
<P>
	But on April 14, Defense Secretary William Cohen scuttled the  
General Dynamics proposal, saying any cost savings to taxpayers 
would not justify the loss of competition for designing and 
building Navy ships. 
</P>
<P>
	The Litton proposal is expected to require a Pentagon review as  
well. Michael R. Brown, chairman and CEO of Litton, said the 
company has had preliminary discussions with the Department of 
Defense about the offer, and claimed the acquisitions would enhance 
competition within the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	William P. Fricks, chairman and chief executive officer of  
Newport News Shipbuilding, said the company's board of directors 
agreed to ``preliminary discussions'' with Litton ``to fully 
evaluate the terms of the offer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to emphasize, however, that our board has not made any  
determination as to the adequacy of Litton's present proposal, and 
there can be no assurance that any transaction proposed by Litton 
will be acceptable to our board,'' Fricks said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert L. Bossier Jr., chairman and CEO of Avondale, said the  
company had Litton's offer under review and would comment further 
when the review is complete. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Rear Adm. Eugene Carroll, deputy director of the  
Washington-based Center for Defense Information, a Pentagon 
watchdog group, said the Litton proposal is another indication of 
consolidation pressures in the defense industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``The drive in the whole military complex is for consolidation  
and so-called economies of scale, where they cut costs and overhead 
-- in theory, to the advantage of the Department of Defense,'' 
Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
	Litton controls a number of aerospace, defense and electronics  
businesses, including Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Miss., a 
builder of Navy destroyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport News Shipbuilding, where the Steelworkers union has been  
on strike since April 5 over wages and other benefits, is the only 
builder of Navy aircraft carriers and shares submarine work with 
General Dynamics' Electric Boat division in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	Avondale designs, builds and overhauls Navy surface ships as  
well as commercial vessels.

<HEADLINE>  Indonesia Signs East Timor Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Now that a historic accord has given the  
people of East Timor a vote on their future, the next hurdle is to 
stop escalating violence so voters can decide whether to remain 
part of Indonesia or seek independence. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement signed Wednesday by the foreign ministers of  
Portugal and Indonesia and witnessed by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi 
Annan states clearly that ending violence and intimidation ``is a 
prerequisite'' for holding a free and fair ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed the former  
Portuguese colony in 1976. It has refused to allow U.N. 
peacekeeping troops to oversee the Aug. 8 ballot -- and the 
agreement states that Jakarta is responsible for ensuring that 
voting is held ``in an atmosphere free of intimidation, violence or 
interference from any side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stressing that ending violence is ``crucial,'' Annan noted that  
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie had given his word that he would 
do his utmost to maintain law and order. 
</P>
<P>
	In a memo, Annan says the first step is to bring armed civilian  
groups under control. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro-independence rebel groups and pro-Indonesian militiamen  
blame each other for the surge in fighting following Indonesia's 
surprise announcement in January that it would offer the 800,000 
East Timorese independence if they rejected wide-ranging autonomy. 
Both sides signed a peace pledge on April 21, along with top 
Indonesian military leaders, but the violence has continued. 
</P>
<P>
	Annan said all armed groups must disarm before the vote and  
Indonesian military forces must also be redeployed. 
</P>
<P>
	There must also be an immediate ban on rallies by armed groups  
as well as freedom for both sides to hold peaceful political 
activities and have access to the media, his memo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Independence activists have demanded a major reduction of  
Indonesian troops in East Timor and disarmament of the militias. 
Pro-Indonesian militia leaders oppose the U.N.-supervised ballot 
and have warned that they will fight for their cause. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement says the parties should ``take the necessary steps  
to achieve disarmament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, while insisting his  
government was determined to demilitarize East Timor, said his 
country could not promise to disarm the militias immediately 
because of difficulties in getting pro-independence rebels down 
from the mountains. He also stressed that disarmament requires 
cooperation of both groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement states that Indonesian police will be ``solely  
responsible'' for maintaining law and order, and that Annan will 
make some unarmed U.N. civilian police available to serve as 
advisers and to supervise ballot boxes as they travel to and from 
polling stations. 
</P>
<P>
	A 600-strong U.N. mission will oversee voting and a U.N. advance  
team has already arrived in East Timor, U.N. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama handed over a $10 million  
check from the Portuguese government to help finance the U.N. 
mission.

<HEADLINE> Poll Finds Support for New Gun Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Support for gun control jumped in the week  
after the high school shootings in Colorado, according to an 
Associated Press poll, and people said reducing violence in TV 
shows and the movies were key to avoiding future school violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The 51 percent who think tougher gun laws are more effective  
than tighter enforcement of current laws is up 9 percentage points 
from just before the deaths at the school in Littleton, Colo. Also, 
40 percent of adults said parents should face charges if a child 
younger than 18 commits a crime with a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	ICR of Media, Pa., conducted one poll in the four days before  
the April 20 rampage. Some of the questions were repeated in an 
April 28-May 2 poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the school shootings, 47 percent said better enforcement  
of existing laws was the way to limit gun violence, while 42 
percent said tougher gun laws would be more effective. After the 
shootings, 51 percent said tougher gun laws would be more 
effective, while 39 percent said better enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar increase was found when people were asked whether they  
favored or opposed stricter gun-control laws. In the first poll, 55 
percent were in favor and 34 percent were opposed. The second poll 
found 63 percent in favor and 31 percent opposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether President Clinton and others who are calling for tougher  
gun laws succeed may depend, in part, on whether the increased 
public support is permanent or merely a short-lived reaction to the 
Littleton tragedy, where two heavily armed teen-age gunmen killed 
12 students and a teacher before killing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's proposals include raising the legal age for handgun  
possession from 18 to 21 and holding negligent parents responsible 
when their children commit crimes with guns. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just seems it's too easy for minors to get guns, not just  
off the street but from within the household,'' said Maria Vigil, a 
26-year-old mother of four from Fort Collins, Colo. ``I like the 
idea of waiting until you're 21 to buy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charlton Heston, president of the National Rifle Association,  
argues that better enforcement of current gun laws is the answer. 
</P>
<P>
	Those most likely to shift positions after the Colorado  
shootings were senior citizens and women. Just over half of older 
Americans supported tougher gun controls before the shooting, 
compared with more than two-thirds afterward. Among women, 
two-thirds supported tougher gun laws in the first poll; about 
three-quarters favored them after the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	When people were asked after the shootings what one step would  
be most effective in stopping school violence, 27 percent said 
reducing violence in TV shows and movies, 23 percent favored using 
metal detectors in schools and 21 percent chose increased 
counseling for teens. 
</P>
<P>
	It stands to reason that having more violent images in movies,  
TV shows and video games would affect people's behavior, said Gary 
MacTavish, a 54-year-old engineer and father of three grown 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	``American private industry spends billions of dollars on  
advertising because it works,'' said MacTavish of St. Croix Falls, 
Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	The error margin in the most recent AP poll of 1,006 adults was  
plus or minus 3 percentage points. The error margin in the earlier 
poll of 765 adults was plus or minus 4 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Given a choice of five factors as most to blame for the Colorado  
shootings -- school officials, availability of guns, the boys' 
parents, TV and movies or the Internet -- about four out of 10 
pointed to the shooters' parents. Other top factors cited were 
availability of guns, 24 percent, and TV and movies, 14 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The shootings made many reflect on the responsibilities of  
parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I saw the Colorado thing, it scared me a lot,'' said Mati  
Nixon, a 28-year-old legal assistant and mother of two from Dallas. 
``They were breaking glass in the garage,'' she said, suggesting 
that should have raised questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why is my son dressing in black? What's going on in the  
garage? I do blame their parents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tess Salcedo, a 32-year-old mother of three from Lakewood,  
Calif., agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's harder to hassle with your kids, easier to just say 'do  
what you want.' That's not the right thing to do -- it's not being a 
parent,'' she said. ``But if a kid is old enough to do an adult 
crime, the kid should pay.''

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Consumer Privacy Measure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate today overwhelmingly adopted a  
measure aimed at protecting consumers' privacy by making it a 
federal crime for anyone to misrepresent himself to obtain 
someone's private financial data. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 95-2 for the amendment to sweeping legislation the  
Senate is considering that would let banks, securities firms and 
insurance companies get more deeply into each other's businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, proposed by Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, chairman of  
the Senate Banking Committee, responded to Americans' growing 
concern over privacy in an era of consolidations creating huge 
financial institutions selling everything from checking accounts to 
mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans have become increasingly concerned about the issue''  
of privacy, said Sen. Paul Sarbanes of Maryland, the banking 
panel's senior Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	The amendment takes aim at the practice of pretext calling, in  
which people call employees at banks and other businesses and use 
Social Security numbers to get information about bank accounts and 
other financial data. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Sens. Connie Mack of Florida and Don Nickles of  
Oklahoma voted against the amendment. Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, 
R-Ill., voted ``present''; he owns a large stake in the Bank of 
Montreal, which previously bought his family's Illinois bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote came a day after the Senate, in a setback for the  
Clinton administration, defeated an amendment that would have 
removed provisions in a financial services overhaul bill that 
Democrats saw as an attack on the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act. 
The vote was 52-45. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm wants to exempt small rural banks from the  
community-lending law and make it harder for the government to use 
satisfactory community-lending ratings as a requirement for banks 
being allowed to expand. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate on Wednesday also rejected, on a party-line 54-43  
vote, a Democratic version of the financial services legislation, 
which would lift Depression-era barriers separating banks, 
securities firms and insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The House, meanwhile, overwhelmingly passed legislation  
Wednesday that would make it harder for people to sweep away their 
debts in bankruptcy, despite the threat of a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	House members, seeking to stem the rising tide of personal  
bankruptcies, gave the bipartisan bill a 313-108 veto-proof vote. 
The legislation, sought by credit card companies, got solid 
Republican support but split the Democrats. The Senate hasn't yet 
voted on a parallel measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House threatened a veto. The administration especially  
criticized the measure's creation of a ``means test'' based on 
debtors' income to determine whether they must gradually repay 
their debts or erase them entirely while under bankruptcy court 
protection from creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the White House called the means test  
``inflexible and arbitrary,'' while reaffirming its support in 
principle for rewriting the bankruptcy laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the House vote on the bankruptcy bill, Rep. Henry Hyde,  
R-Ill., the Judiciary Committee chairman, and Rep. John Conyers of 
Michigan, the panel's senior Democrat, tried to soften the 
means-test provision, which uses the Internal Revenue Service's 
living expense standards to help determine how much debtors can 
repay. But their effort was rebuffed in a 238-184 vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Big bank-owned credit card networks, notably Visa and  
MasterCard, and retail-business groups say their losses from debts 
forgiven in bankruptcy have forced them to raise interest rates for 
consumers who handle credit responsibly. 
</P>
<P>
	But consumer groups, unions, civil rights groups and bankruptcy  
attorneys maintain the legislation favors corporate profits over 
the needs of families struggling with debt who need a fresh start. 
They insist that the credit card companies share the blame by 
flooding consumers with mailed solicitations to entice them into 
easy credit. 
</P>
<P>
	By voice vote, the lawmakers adopted an amendment requiring  
credit card companies to clearly disclose their late-payment fees 
and how long it would take customers to pay off balances if they 
make only minimum monthly payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies also would have to clearly reveal the expiration  
dates of introductory ``teaser rates'' and the higher interest 
rates replacing them. The same disclosures would have to be made in 
offers for credit card accounts made over the Internet, which have 
attracted an estimated 7.8 million people in the last five years.

<HEADLINE>  Death Toll Rises After Tornadoes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Wearing hand-me-down clothes and driving  
borrowed cars, residents struggled to put their lives back together 
Thursday from the ruins of this week's twisters. The death toll, 
meanwhile, rose to 46 in Oklahoma and Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimberly Taylor wore a plaid overshirt, striped T-shirt and blue  
sweatpants as she collected clothes for her six children at a Del 
City church. She laughed at her mismatched outfit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our house was destroyed,'' she said. ``I don't have a car to  
even drive around in. Everything is just borrowed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 3,000 homes and businesses were destroyed in  
Oklahoma. About 1,500 buildings were destroyed in Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	The smell of hamburgers and sauteed onions wafted down one  
ravaged street in Moore, where volunteers served up free meals to 
residents picking through the ruins of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Bulmer, a pastor at Oakcrest Church of Christ, handed out  
sandwiches, water and gloves to people with nothing left. Some were 
so grateful, they were speechless, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of times we have to insist they take things,'' he said.  
``These are proud people. They're not used to being on the 
receiving end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Incredible stories of survival came from hospital beds Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	Angie Todd, her face swollen and bruised, had a broken shoulder,  
a shattered hand and a finger that will probably have to be 
amputated. The 29-year-old woman, her boyfriend and young son 
survived after being pulled from their bathroom and tossed four or 
five houses down the street. 
</P>
<P>
	``I actually remember being in the funnel of the tornado,'' Ms.  
Todd said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the injured died overnight, bringing the number of dead  
from Monday's tornadoes in Oklahoma to 41. Five people died in 
Kansas. About 750 people in Oklahoma and 150 in Kansas were 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The phone at the Oklahoma Medical Examiner's Office continued to  
ring with calls from people worried about relatives unaccounted for 
since the storms. Fifty-four people were on the missing person's 
list Thursday morning, but the number dropped as loved ones were 
located safe and sound during the day, spokesman Ray Blakeney said. 
Searchers have combed devastated neighborhoods with dogs and 
infrared devices. 
</P>
<P>
	James Scarberry, 30, driving a pickup truck lent by a co-worker,  
felt lucky to have found his wallet and ATM card under the bed in 
what was left of his bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess you don't realize everything you're missing until you  
have to look for it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Masteller stood on top of her house, now 2 feet tall, in a  
T-shirt, jeans and shoes that were obviously too big for her. She 
wore an old pair of flowered-rimmed glasses that her son pulled 
from the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is all I've got,'' she said, tugging at the shirt. ``I  
don't have credit cards. I don't have a checking book. Not even my 
wedding ring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The school system in the suburb of Moore, which lost an  
elementary school and a high school, said classes will resume on 
Monday. The 2,200 displaced students will finish the last two weeks 
of school at a nearby college, another elementary school and an old 
administration building. 
</P>
<P>
	The storms damaged or destroyed the homes of at least 1,500  
students and those of nearly 100 teachers and administrators, 
district spokeswoman Susan Pierce said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel strongly that in a time of crisis, one thing the  
school can offer is routine, stability and structure in the school 
day,'' she said. ``It's important for those students who have 
suffered a great loss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Vice President Al Gore toured the tornado damage in  
Haysville, Kan., and hugged people who lost their homes. He said 
the Labor Department will spend $5.7 million to help clean up the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	Victims of the storm were remembered Thursday during a ceremony  
at the Oklahoma Capitol to observe the National Day of Prayer. 
</P>

	SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- A jury awarded Priscilla Presley  
$1.74 million in damages against film producers and publicists who 
used her name to promote a proposed film based on an unauthorized

<HEADLINE> N.D. Canola Crop Expected To Rise / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FARGO, N.D. (AP) -- Bill Mickelson grew his first acre of canola  
more than 20 years ago as an experiment. This spring, his canola 
crop will rival that of his spring wheat fields. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rolla farmer is among a growing number expected to push  
North Dakota's combined canola crop above 1.2 million acres this 
spring -- the first canola crop of more than 1 million acres in the 
state. Canola is a grain, often used to make cooking oil. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been our most profitable crop for the last five years,''  
said Mickelson, who farms with his brother. ``And even with prices 
down a little right now, we'll make more on it than anything 
else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canola has quickly become the fastest growing crop in North  
Dakota. In 1991, farmers planted just 30,000 acres. In 1997, the 
crop had grown to 456,000 acres, and it nearly doubled last year to 
800,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	It has become so popular, in fact, that the previously  
loose-knit Northern Canola Growers Association recently hired a 
full-time director to oversee marketing and production efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It got to the point where it became too demanding for the  
board of directors to handle it all in the little free time they 
had,'' said Barry Coleman, who began his duties as executive 
director March 1. ``So they hired me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The association has about 150 producers as members. They pay a  
$40 annual membership fee and checkoff fees of 3 cents per 
hundredweight of canola. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman said there has been a surge in new membership requests  
this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think farmers looked around and saw that this is one of the  
few crops where producers are making any money,'' he said. ``It's 
kept a lot of folks in business these past years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canola's success as a rotational crop for wheat, along with  
stable prices for raw canola and growing consumer demand for 
healthier oils, has helped increase canola production, Coleman and 
Mickelson say. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only are individual farmers like Mickelson planting more of  
it, but farmers who have never grown the crop are now including it 
in their rotations. Canola currently is grown in every county of 
North Dakota, which continues to be the largest producer of the 
crop in the nation. 
</P>

	IDAHO FALLS, Idaho (AP) -- If there is one thing that keeps  
potato growers in the field, it is the prospect of winning big, 
says Bruce Huffaker, publisher of the North American Potato Market 
News. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite poor prices, he said, there are no signs eastern Idaho  
farmers are cutting back on acreage this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	They tend to look at potatoes as a cure-all, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	After a rainy week that slowed things down, growers are  
returning to the fields. And after three years of depressed prices, 
many are looking at 1999 as their last shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Another bad year will finish a lot of guys off,'' said Mark  
Mickelsen, who farms 7,000 acres and owns Rigby Produce.

<HEADLINE> Russia, NATO Agree on Kosovo Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- Russia and the major Western powers set  
aside their differences over NATO airstrikes Thursday and drafted a 
joint plan to end the Kosovo conflict, including the deployment of 
an international force to keep the peace after the withdrawal of 
Yugoslav forces. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and other Western officials welcomed Russia's  
backing for ``effective international civil and security 
presences'' in Kosovo, where a NATO campaign has failed to halt the 
expulsions of one-third of the ethnic Albanians in the southern 
Serb province since March. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo's most prominent ethnic Albanian leader told a news  
conference in Rome a day after he and his family were allowed to 
leave Yugoslavia that he favored an international peacekeeping 
force -- including NATO -- in his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need above all to create security in Kosovo so people can  
return,'' said Ibrahim Rugova, who was a negotiator for the ethnic 
Albanian delegation at the failed peace talks in Rambouillet, 
France, that preceded the 6-week-old NATO air campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton described the draft agreed to in Germany as ``a  
significant step forward ... increasing the likelihood that there 
will ultimately be a resolution of this that will actually work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He made his remarks after meeting a grateful crowd of Kosovo  
refugees housed at a German facility and greeting three U.S. 
soldiers freed last week by Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO hopes getting Moscow on board in a common front will  
increase the diplomatic pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic to drop his resistance to an international military 
presence in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	To bring in Russia, the Western powers agreed on a statement  
that makes no reference to any NATO role in Kosovo peacekeeping and 
stresses the importance of U.N. backing for the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	However, NATO ministers insisted they had not dropped demands  
for an international force that is strongly armed, equipped with a 
mandate to use force and spearheaded by alliance troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``This must mean a strong military force with NATO at its  
core,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said after the 
meeting of foreign ministers from Russia and the G-7 group of 
leading industrialized nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without robust military presence, nothing will be achieved,''  
added German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, who chaired the 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministers issued seven ``general principles'' for a  
political solution to the crisis that they said will be proposed as 
the basis for a U.N. resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Apart from the international force, they include a verifiable  
end to violence in Kosovo; withdrawal of military, police and 
paramilitary forces; establishment of an interim administration in 
the province; the ``safe and free'' return of refugees; economic 
aid to the region; and a political settlement granting 
``substantial self-government for Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said ``it would be  
premature to speak of a breakthrough, but progress has been made,'' 
the Interfax news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Fischer acknowledged NATO and Moscow, which has religious and  
cultural ties with the Serbs, remain at odds over Russian calls for 
suspending the bombing and over the strength and composition of the 
international force. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic's refusal to accept an armed international force in  
Kosovo has been the main sticking point of previous peace attempts. 
Western ministers said Russia's backing and the possibility of a 
U.N. resolution would crank up pressure to accept. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a unity of purpose, including the Russians, so there  
is increasing pressure being applied,'' Canadian Foreign Minister 
Lloyd Axworthy said after the 2 1/2-hour meeting in a government guest 
house overlooking the Rhine River outside Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
	Axworthy said senior diplomats from the G-8 nations will meet  
within days to draw up the text of a U.N. resolution to back the 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said no peace deal would  
work without a forceful international presence led by NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	``The refugees are not going to return to Kosovo unless there is  
a credible protection,'' Cook said. ``If it is going to be 
credible, if it is going to work, it must have real teeth and those 
teeth will need to be provided by the NATO countries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said the force will include troops from the United  
States and probably Russia. NATO officials said Britain and France 
would also participate, rejecting suggestions that allied nations 
taking part in the bombing campaign be excluded. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO, meanwhile, said that despite the intensified diplomatic  
efforts there would be no letup in the air raids on Yugoslavia. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Schools Struggle With Colo Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANTIOCH, Ill. (AP) -- Andrew Eisen is a bookish 15-year-old who  
likes to write stories and poems, an honors student who says he's 
never been in trouble at school. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the sophomore at Antioch Community High School says he can't  
set foot on campus because administrators fear he may be capable of 
killing a classmate. 
</P>
<P>
	In the days after two students unleashed a deadly attack at a  
Colorado school, Eisen's story is becoming increasingly familiar. 
Across the country, students carrying weapons, overheard making 
threats or found scribbling something deemed threatening on a piece 
of paper are being kicked out of school. Bomb threats have kept 
thousands more at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a tough situation because administrators charged with  
keeping schools safe are not taking any chances,'' said Doug 
Bruenlin of the Family Institute at Northwestern University. ``But 
they are doing a fair amount of damage to kids who had no intention 
of doing any harm to anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The day after the Columbine High School shooting, an Antioch  
teacher urged students to report any problems they were having with 
other students. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Eisen's attorney, Jed Stone, another student told  
the teacher that he had overheard Eisen say he didn't like him and 
that he had gone shooting with his father. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone said that report triggered a chain of events that included  
a call to police and a search of Eisen's locker, where officials 
found papers and poems he'd written. On one sheet of paper, beneath 
the words ``The Absurdity of Violence,'' he had written that a 
student ``walked into a cafeteria and opened fire with a .22 
carbine rifle, witnesses said.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When I found out (the other teen) was scared of me, I thought  
it was funny,'' Eisen said. So, the next time he saw the other 
student, he said he told him, ``I hate you.''' 
</P>
<P>
	On April 22, Eisen was summoned to see the principal. He was  
taken to the police station, where he said he was fingerprinted and 
charged with disorderly conduct. He then spent a week in juvenile 
hall. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials and the police department would not discuss the  
case. The Lake County state's attorney's office did not return 
phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	But Nancy Krent, an attorney representing the school district,  
defended how the case has been handled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the facts of this case any school district that acted  
the way this school district did would have acted properly,'' Krent 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisen said he fears he may be expelled for the remainder of this  
school year and all of the next school year. Sheila Eisen worries 
about what his arrest will do to her son's goal of going to a top 
college or to his recent acceptance to a prestigious exchange 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has the potential to ruin his life,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Cavs Lead League in Injuries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- If someone had accidentally stumbled into the  
Cavaliers' news conference today, they might have thought it was a 
symposium on orthopedics or a college Anatomy 101 lecture. 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting next to the microphones and water glasses on the front  
table were two skeleton models,one of a large human right foot, the 
other of a right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	The props were all you needed to know about the Cavs' 1999  
season, 50 games in which Cleveland's players and fans got a crash 
course on metacarpals, meniscus and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Crazy,'' said guard Derek Anderson, who missed 10 games with  
an injured right knee, and the season finale in Toronto with the 
flu. ``It's amazing what we had to go through. It's just hard to 
believe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cavs redefined the overused ``day-to-day'' sports cliche  
this season en route to a 22-28 finish. Cleveland's players were 
sometimes hour-to-hour and minute-to-minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Injuries ravaged the young team, turning a year which started  
with promise and playoff hopes into one of survival. When the 
season ended Wednesday night with a 96-87 loss to the Raptors -- 
Cleveland's 10th loss in 11 games -- the Cavs had seven healthy 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess you could say we had seven survivors,'' said Mitchell  
Butler, who was waived early in the year and brought back as the 
injured list filled up. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cavs players who didn't survive until the finish included  
center Zydrunas Ilgauskas (broken left foot), forward Shawn Kemp 
(sprained left mid-foot), guard Brevin Knight (broken left hand) 
and forward Corie Blount (torn knee cartilage). 
</P>
<P>
	After Anderson got sick earlier this week and Wesley Person went  
down with a turned ankle, coach Mike Fratello had to use assistant 
coaches Marc Iavaroni, Sidney Lowe and former Cavs guard and 
current broadcaster Austin Carr just to get through a pregame 
shootaround. 
</P>
<P>
	It was that kind of season.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a tough, tough year for our organization, our players,  
and our fans,'' said Fratello. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cavs hoped to build on the momentum created last season when  
they qualified for the playoffs with three rookie starters. 
However, the NBA lockout took care of that. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, in their fifth game, the Cavs lost Ilgauskas, the 7-foot-3  
center they signed during the offseason to a seven-year contract, 
for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got the double whammy,'' said Anderson. ``We had two weeks  
to get ready for the season and then just when we got going, `Z' 
went down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Ilgauskas out, the Cavs were forced to start forward Vitaly  
Potapenko -- since traded to Boston for Andrew DeClercq -- at center, 
leaving Kemp with little help inside and prone to constant 
double-teams in the post. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were never able to evaluate our team as a team,'' said  
general manager Wayne Embry. ``We had the abbreviated training camp 
and then Z's injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ilgauskas' injury was the season's most devastating, and the one  
the Cavs will watch closest this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. John Bergfeld, the team doctor, spent nearly 25 minutes  
reviewing the team's medical dossier during Thursday's news 
conference. Bergfeld said he expected Ilgauskas to make a full 
recovery and he should be ready for training camp this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``We anticipate it should heal itself up well,'' said Bergfeld.  
</P>
<P>
	In a season of gloom and doom there were some positives.  
</P>
<P>
	Kemp, who became the butt of jokes and a poster boy for the NBA  
lockout when he arrived at training camp weighing more than 300 
pounds, slimmed down and carried the team by himself for much of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing with his back to the basket more than at any time in his  
10-year career, Kemp led Cleveland in scoring (a career-high 20.5 
points per game) and rebounds (9.2 per game). He was also an 
inspirational leader, and would frequently pull aside teammates on 
the floor to point out what they should be doing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He showed a maturity this year that I hadn't seen in him  
before,'' Fratello said. ``He was amazing night in and night out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kemp is convinced that a healthy Cavs squad with a few new  
pieces can compete for the NBA title. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got five starters who can hang with any starting five in  
the league,'' he said. ``We need to improve our bench and score 
more consistently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cavs aren't planning any major changes for the offseason,  
but CEO Jim Boland said the team was concerned about attendance 
figures that dropped 17 percent. A new uniform could be in the 
works, too, Boland said. 
</P>
<P>
	In acquiring DeClercq from Boston, the Cavs also got a  
first-round draft pick from the Celtics. Cleveland can use the pick 
-- it can not be one of the top three -- this year or in 2000 or 
2001. With that pick and the one they already own, the Cavaliers 
could have two top 10 selections. 
</P>
<P>
	After seeing what the Cavs just went through, Jim Paxson, the  
club's vice president of basketball operations, joked about what 
they might do in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe one of our picks ought to be part of the Cleveland  
Clinic,'' he said.

	Foreign Ministers Meet Over Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- On the sidelines of President Clinton's  
visit, foreign ministers from western powers and Russia met today 
seeking agreement on the outline of a Kosovo peace plan that could 
be endorsed by the United Nations. Getting Russia, which opposes 
NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia, into such a common front could 
increase diplomatic pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic to settle on NATO's terms. Moscow, a traditional Serb 
ally, appears to be moving toward supporting a key alliance demand: 
a NATO-led international force to secure the return of Kosovo 
refugees.

	BLACE, Macedonia (AP) -- Thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees  
trying to cross into Macedonia were stranded at a town inside 
Kosovo today after being turned back overnight by Macedonian 
authorities. A handful who were allowed to enter said a packed 
trainload of refugees was waiting near the border today, its 
occupants ordered to remain on board. The U.N. refugee agency said 
Serb police had beaten back some Kosovo Albanians at the border the 
previous day.

15 in eastern China, state media reported Thursday. The bus was 
carrying 43 middle-school students, two teachers and four other 
people when it crashed yesterday into the Changting Reservoir near 
the city of Hangzhou, the Xinhua News Agency said. Ten people were

	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- A U.S. team will begin inspecting a

Korean officials said today. About 15 American officials and 
nuclear experts will spend several days inspecting the site at 
Kumchang-ri, northwest of the North's capital of Pyongyang, they 
said. At least two inspections are planned to clear U.S. suspicions 
that the communist country may be reactivating a nuclear weapons

	LINDEN, Tenn. (AP) -- A line of powerful storms blew through  
western Tennessee early today, destroying homes, closing schools 
and damaging buildings in 30 counties. At least four people were 
killed. Two of the victims, a man and woman, died in a Linden home 
that was destroyed last night by straight-line winds, said Capt. 
Gary Rogers of the Perry County rescue service. A 14-year-old girl 
who was missing Wednesday night was found early today and taken to 
a hospital where she died on arrival, according to officials. The 
fourth victim was killed when his car hit a tree that had been 
blown across the highway in Madison County, about 80 miles 
northeast of Memphis.

to be freed next week, according to a state official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. A Division of Parole spokesman would say

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales Strong in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sales at many of nation's biggest retailers  
soared to better-than-expected levels in April as the continued 
strength of the U.S. economy encouraged Americans to do lots of 
shopping last month. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third straight month of surprisingly strong sales,  
boding well for first-quarter earnings. A number of chains -- 
including the Limited and Ann Taylor -- have said they will top 
forecasts for the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most Americans are working and feeling pretty good, and that  
is driving traffic into the stores,'' said Steve Paspal, senior 
retail analyst at Sovereign Asset Management, a subsidiary of John 
Hancock Funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The raging U.S. economy, combined with low unemployment and  
inflation levels has made consumers confident about their personal 
finances and has raised their eagerness to spend. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the stock market continues its record-setting pace,  
with the Dow Jones industrial average crossing the 11,000 mark 
earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The big winners in April were specialty clothing chains, while  
department stores also fared well. Discounters were strong, as 
shoppers turned to stores like Wal-Mart and Target for their wide 
selection and affordable prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the recent past, the discounters have been doing so much  
better than the department stores, but now I think that the 
department stores might be closing that gap a little thanks to 
strong demand for fashionable apparel,'' Paspal said. 
</P>
<P>
	The strength in sales came despite being compared with the  
stunning performance of April 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Some merchants -- including Dayton Hudson and the Gap -- were hurt  
by the early Easter holiday this year, which shifted most of the 
holiday buying into March rather than April. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite some hints of weakness, analysts remained confident that  
retailers would report healthy profit gains for the first quarter. 
Most will begin to release their earnings in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most retailers have had to make minimum markdowns to push out  
merchandise,'' said Walter Loeb, who runs the retail consulting 
firm Loeb Associates. ``I am very optimistic about this quarter and 
about the spring into summer season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, reported sales from  
stores open at least a year rose 4.6 percent from a year earlier, 
while total sales were up 11.5 percent. Sales from stores open at 
least a year, known as same-store sales, are considered the most 
accurate measure of a retailer's strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Other retailers' reports:  
</P>
<P>
	--Sears: Same-store sales down 0.9 percent, total sales down 4.3  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Kmart: Same-store sales up 5.7 percent, total sales up 7.3  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--J.C. Penney: Same-store department store sales fell 0.2  
percent, same-store sales at Eckerd drugstores rose 7.7 percent, 
total sales rose 6.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dayton Hudson: Same-store sales down 1.3 percent, total sales  
up 2.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Federated: Same-store sales rose 1.5 percent, total sales up  
12.9 percent. Federated's total sales included revenues from the 
Internet and catalog seller Fingerhut, which it acquired in March. 
</P>
<P>
	--May Department Stores: Same-store sales up 7.7 percent, total  
sales up 12.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Limited: Same-store sales up 5 percent, total sales were flat.  
</P>
<P>
	--Gap: Same-store sales up 1 percent, total sales up 21 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Ann Taylor: Same-store sales up 10.3 percent, total sales up  
17.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Widow of Celtics Star Testifies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- After days of tests prompted by Reggie Lewis'  
collapse during a playoff game, team doctors broke the news to the 
Boston Celtics captain and his wife: The basketball star had a 
life-threatening heart condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was devastating,'' Lewis' widow recalled as she testified  
Thursday during the malpractice trial stemming from the player's 
death in 1993. ``Reggie had experienced excellent health up to that 
point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donna Harris-Lewis detailed the subsequent search for a second  
opinion that led her to Dr. Gilbert Mudge, a highly respected 
Boston cardiologist. Mudge eventually discounted the potentially 
career-ending diagnosis of heart arrhythmia and told Lewis he had a 
less serious neurological condition that causes fainting spells. 
</P>
<P>
	Three months later, Lewis collapsed and died while practicing  
jump shots at Brandeis University. He was 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis sued Mudge and two doctors who consulted on the  
case, Mark Creager and Peter Friedman, claiming they misdiagnosed 
and mistreated Lewis' condition. A third consultant settled with 
Harris-Lewis for an undisclosed amount. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge has said he was unable to diagnose Lewis properly because  
he lied about cocaine use. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, under questioning by her lawyer, Robert Harley,  
Harris-Lewis denied her late husband ever used illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was totally against it,'' she said, adding that having  
grown up in rough neighborhoods -- she in Bridgeport, Conn., and 
Lewis in Baltimore -- both had seen lives destroyed by drugs. ``It 
wasn't part of our lifestyle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After collasping during a playoff game against Charlotte in  
1993, Lewis was diagnosed with arrhythmia and told he might need to 
wear a pacemaker. 
</P>
<P>
	The unexpectedly dire news, along with Harris-Lewis' displeasure  
at the way the doctors seemed to be keeping the couple in the dark 
while releasing information to the media, led her to seek advice 
from a friend at Brigham and Women's Hospital. He recommended 
Mudge. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis recalled how after getting the referral, Lewis  
stripped off the heart monitors attached to his chest and left New 
England Baptist in the middle of the night for a meeting with 
Mudge. 
</P>
<P>
	The cardiologist initially agreed with the arrhythmia diagnosis,  
Harris-Lewis said. But after ordering further tests, he revised his 
opinion and told Lewis he suffered from neurocardiogenic syncope -- 
and could, in all likelihood, return to professional basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were obviously happy,'' Harris-Lewis recalled. Her lawyer  
then asked if she believed the advice and trusted Mudge. She 
answered yes to both questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis, who met Lewis when both were students at  
Northeastern University, is suing to recover money he would have 
made had he lived, estimates of which have ranged from $40 million 
to more than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the doctors have suggested the Lewises had incentive  
to lie about drug use, including the Celtics' contract and 
insurance policy that would have been nullified by such activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis, who lives in the Boston area with her 6-year-old  
son and 5-year-old daughter, is scheduled to resume her testimony 
Friday morning in Suffolk Superior Court.

<HEADLINE> Cholesterol-Lowering Margarine Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two margarines that actually cut cholesterol  
will soon appear on supermarket shelves nationwide at a price tag 
four times the regular spread. 
</P>
<P>
	Market analysts suggest that many health-conscious Americans  
will be ready to try them anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Take Control, made by Unilever's Lipton unit began hitting the  
market last week, and Benecol, by the drug maker Johnson &AMP; Johnson, 
is nearing approval by the Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	They're among the first major foods that are designed to act  
like drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the companies plan to market them on two levels --  
the traditional way through advertising, and also by convincing 
doctors to suggest them to patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be an easy sell,'' said Roland Rust, a marketing  
professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn. ``It sounds 
like a winner to me, because there are a lot of people looking for 
a magic bullet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Connie Diekman, a registered dietitian in St. Louis, Mo. and  
spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association, stresses the 
margarines won't replace a careful diet and exercise. ``But it 
appears these products are one more way to lower your blood 
cholesterol level,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Take Control sells for about $3.70 for a 10 ounce package.  
Benecol is expected to sell in the same range, though J&AMP;J has yet 
to release a price. 
</P>
<P>
	Al Ries, a marketing consultant with Ries &AMP; Ries in Roswell,  
Ga., suggested the price may limit sales somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
	``A margarine that tastes good and has a cholesterol lowering  
ability is a very good combo and could touch a nerve with high-end 
folks,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies say consumers will pay the premium prices because  
of the growing awareness among Americans to control their 
cholesterol. More than one in three Americans have moderate to high 
cholesterol levels, a major risk factor for heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Lipton says Take Control is more expensive than regular  
margarine because of the high cost of extracting and processing the 
product's main ingredient, a natural soybean extract called plant 
sterols. 
</P>
<P>
	J&AMP;J spokesman Ron Schmid said Benecol's novel health benefits  
justify the higher price. Benecol's main ingredient, stanol ester, 
is derived from a substance found in pine trees. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Benecol and Take Control work by blocking the body from  
absorbing LDL, or bad cholesterol. Benecol will eventually also be 
available in cream cheese spreads and in salad dressing, J&AMP;J said. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for dietary supplements and herbals remedies has soared  
in the past few years as many Americans have looked for cheaper and 
safer alternatives to prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans are snapping up those supplements even without major  
scientific studies supporting the bold health claims of the 
manufacturers. With Benecol and Take Control, the companies already 
have the supporting scientific evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	One study showed regular use of Benecol could reduce cholesterol  
levels by 14 percent. Take Control was found to cut cholesterol by 
7 to 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Lipton says its experience selling butter and margarine will  
give it a boost over J&AMP;J which is primarily a medical device and 
health products company. Lipton makes Promise margarine and ``I 
Can't Believe It's Not Butter!'' 
</P>
<P>
	J&AMP;J contends its close relationship with doctors will give it an  
edge in selling them -- and their patients -- on Benecol. 
</P>
<P>
	Benecol was created the Raisio Group, a Finnish food and  
chemicals company, which introduced it in Finland in 1995 and is 
now partnering with J&AMP;J to sell it in Great Britain and the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	It was initially so popular that Finland stores could not keep  
shelves stocked even at prices six times more than regular 
margarine. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first, people went really crazy. It was the curiosity  
factor,'' said Veli-Pekka Nummelin, managing director of City 
Market, Finland's largest supermarket in Turku. 
</P>
<P>
	Buying has subsided since then, he said. Benecol now accounts  
for 10 percent of margarine sales in Finland. 
</P>
<P>
	Benecol was launched in Great Britain in March,  
</P>
<P>
	Michael Garratt spotted the margarine in a London supermarket  
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Garratt, 62, who had a heart attack a decade ago, was intrigued,  
though initially put off by the $4 price. ``Psychologically, it 
might do me a bit of good,'' he said. Still, he added: ``I'm a bit 
skeptical of their claims.''

<HEADLINE> Pilot Takes Stand in Cable Car Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A Marine pilot charged with  
obstruction of justice said he regrets helping destroy a videotape 
of the training flight that caused 20 deaths at an Italian ski 
resort. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish we would have left the tape there,'' said Capt. Richard  
Ashby, 32, of Mission Viejo, Calif. ``If we had taken the tape, we 
should have turned it over to somebody to watch. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to get out of the aircraft. I was shaking. I wanted  
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A rebuttal prosecution witness, Bernard Coogan, an aircraft  
accident expert, testified today that the videotape would have 
given investigators images to compare with flight recorder data. 
</P>
<P>
	Closing arguments were scheduled for this afternoon before the  
case goes to the seven-man military jury. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense rested Wednesday after Ashby testified for more than  
two hours at his obstruction of justice and conspiracy trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby faces 10 years in prison or dismissal from the service if  
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Feb. 3, 1998, training flight, the right wing of  
Ashby's four-man EA-6B Prowler cut a gondola cable at Cavalese, 
Italy. Twenty people plunged 370 feet to their deaths. A separate 
jury acquitted Ashby in March of 20 manslaughter charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby had testified that he handed the videotape to his  
navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, who later threw the tape into a 
bonfire. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer ``wanted it gone. I wanted to look at it. That's all  
I've ever said,'' Ashby said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no conversation that went as far as, `This is why I  
want to do this.' There was no time,'' Ashby said. ``I took the 
tape out and put in my G-suit pocket and he handed me another tape 
and I put it in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby maintains that he did not intend to obstruct justice.  
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, N.Y., pleaded guilty to the same  
obstruction charges Ashby faces and was sentenced to dismissal from 
the service.

<HEADLINE> Steele About To Start Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- As Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's  
office wraps up its case dealing with an alleged sexual advance by 
President Clinton, prosecutors now have a wide circle of Kathleen 
Willey's friends who say they were told early-on about an 
encounter. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathleen Willey confided to at least five people what she  
testified this week was a ``very forceful'' sexual advance by 
Clinton, while defendant Julie Hiatt Steele related it to at least 
three people, according to evidence presented at Ms. Steele's 
federal jury trial. 
</P>
<P>
	With Ms. Steele's defense about to begin and with so many  
witnesses saying they were told about a Clinton-Willey encounter, 
Ms. Steele's lawyers face the task of convincing the jury that Mrs. 
Willey never took her onetime close friend, Ms. Steele, into her 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele is accused of obstructing Starr's probe of the  
president by falsely denying she wasn't told about the alleged 1993 
advance until March 1997 when she says Mrs. Willey asked her to lie 
about it to Newsweek magazine reporter Michael Isikoff. Ms. Steele 
has contended she lied to Isikoff at the request of Mrs. Willey, 
telling him that Mrs. Willey had confided to her the alleged 
episode with Clinton. She later told Isikoff she had lied. 
</P>
<P>
	On the third day of Ms. Steele's trial Wednesday, prosecution  
witness Amy Horan testified that she initially refrained from 
telling Starr's grand jury some information because Ms. Steele was 
so insistent that she'd never confided the Clinton-Willey encounter 
to Mrs. Horan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think she was trying to change my story,'' Mrs. Horan  
said of Ms. Steele. But before Mrs. Horan testified in Starr's 
probe, Ms. Steele insisted ``we have never discussed this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Horan testified that ``due to our conversation, I couldn't  
be sure'' that she'd been told of the alleged incident as early as 
1993. The uncertainty made her hold back telling that to the grand 
jury. But Mrs. Horan testified she is positive Ms. Steele told her 
of the alleged advance in September 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ms. Steele did influence your recollection ... didn't she?''  
prosecutor David Barger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Horan conceded that Ms. Steele may have done so.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Horan said Ms. Steele's legal team made her feel ``awful''  
before the trial in the course of ``four or five'' phone calls and 
``four'' face-to-face meetings. They reminded Mrs. Horan that her 
friend Ms. Steele ``was facing 20 to life'' if convicted, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Mrs. Horan, two other witnesses -- long-time friend Mary  
Highsmith and Richmond, Va., TV producer William Poveromo -- said 
Ms. Steele informed them of the alleged incident. Poveromo said Ms. 
Steele said she'd been told of it soon after it happened in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	There is testimony at the trial that Mrs. Willey told at least  
five other people besides Ms. Steele: Ruthie Eisen, Linda Tripp, 
Marlene MacDonald, Betsy Pond, all of whom are former White House 
staffers; and a Virginia woman, Diane Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of her testimony Wednesday, Mrs. Willey testified she  
felt threatened when Clinton lawyers Robert Bennett suggested she 
assert her Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination rather 
than answer questions about an alleged sexual advance by the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like that was a threat coming from the president,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barger elicited that testimony from Mrs. Willey after Ms.  
Steele's lawyers zeroed in on the discrepancy between her January 
1998 deposition in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case against 
Clinton and her statements to Starr's office two months later. 
</P>
<P>
	She answered 63 times to Mrs. Jones' attorneys that she could  
not recall key facts about the encounter with Clinton or subsequent 
conversations about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to explain her memory lapses, Mrs. Willey said the Fifth  
Amendment reference and other ``badgering'' by Bennett affected her 
state of mind during the deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett called her testimony ``an absolutely bald-faced lie.''

<HEADLINE> Bombing Continues in Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A NATO missile slammed into a  
residential area in Serbia's second largest city and allied jets 
struck a chemical plant in round-the-clock bombings on Yugoslav 
targets Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Four people were injured Thursday afternoon when a bomb fell  
between a school and a residential building in battered Novi Sad, 
local Studio B TV reported. The bomb smashed windows in surrounding 
buildings and left behind a huge crater. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO struck Novi Sad again hours later, before dawn Friday.  
Powerful detonations were also heard in the southern city of Nis, 
the private Beta news agency reported, without giving details on 
the possible targets at eitehr site. Yugoslav media also reported a 
raid early Friday near Sremska Mitrovica, 45 miles west of 
Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	During the day, NATO struck across Kosovo, where Serb forces  
continue to battle the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army. Four 
civilians were wounded when the allies targeted Lipljan, about 10 
miles south of the provincial capital, Pristina, state-run media 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in Serbia, NATO missiles struck a chemical factory  
near the Danube River port of Prahovo in eastern Serbia on the 
border with Romania, the state-run Tanjug news agency said. One 
person was reported injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Another raid just before midnight Thursday destroyed a railway  
bridge northeast of Belgrade near the Romanian border, Beta said. 
</P>
<P>
	Predawn strikes Thursday morning hit two fuel depots in a major  
industrial center near Nis. A bridge near Novi Pazar in 
southwestern Serbia and a military airfield nearby in central 
Serbia were also destroyed late Wednesday, Montenegrin radio 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	In the capital, where power supplies were still patchy following  
Sunday's bombings of two power plants, air raid warnings sounded 
several times but there no reports of any strikes on the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's attacks came as foreign ministers from Russia and the  
major Western powers, meeting in Germany, agreed on a draft plan 
for ending the Kosovo conflict, including the deployment of an 
international force to keep the peace after the withdrawal of 
Yugoslav forces. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO launched airstrikes against Yugoslavia on March 24 in an  
attempt to stop atrocities against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. 
Since then, more than one-third of Kosovo's 2 million population 
have fled the province, mostly into Macedonia and Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	As the foreign ministers gathered in Bonn, Yugoslavian President  
Slobodan Milosevic met with Greek envoy Carolos Papaouillas, 
presumably to discuss the outline of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, state-run media quoted Milosevic as saying NATO must stop  
its air campaign before any peace efforts can go ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic said a ``just solution on all open issues can be  
reached through the political process of direct talks, which is 
predicated upon an end of the aggression and return of peace and 
return of Yugoslav citizens to their homes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Serbian President Milan Milutinovic, who also attended the  
meeting, was quoted saying NATO ``aggression must stop 
immediately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic has refused NATO demands that an armed NATO-led force  
be allowed into Kosovo to protect returning refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview published Thursday by the Austrian daily Kurier,  
Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic said his country would 
agree to a U.N.-led force. 
</P>
<P>
	``We accept an international presence, a U.N. mission,'' he told  
the paper. ``The mandate, structure and number of troops should be 
agreed upon between Yugoslavia and U.N. Secretary General Kofi 
Annan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jovanovic refused to comment on whether or not the force would  
be armed. He insisted a U.N. force could not include NATO members 
participating in the bombing.

<HEADLINE> Marlins May Be Worse Than Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Matt Mantei is the closer for the Florida Marlins,  
which is a lot like being their third-base coach or director of 
ticket operations, because he has plenty of idle time. 
</P>
<P>
	One month and 28 games into the season, Mantei still awaits his  
first save opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Isn't that weird?'' he said. ``Every night in the fifth  
inning, I get ready. But ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	But when your team is losing, there's no chance for a save. And  
Florida is losing at a record pace. 
</P>
<P>
	It's an appalling prospect: The Marlins may be even worse than  
last year, when they lost 108 games, the most in the National 
League since 1969. Florida goes into a weekend series at Los 
Angeles with an eight-game losing streak and a 6-22 record. 
</P>
<P>
	For the entire season, the Marlins' won-loss percentage of .214  
projects to a major-league record 127 defeats. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's frustrating to come in every day and see the loss column  
keeps getting worse,'' Mantei said. ``I go places and hope people 
don't recognize me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's rarely a problem in a city that has lost interest in  
baseball. The Marlins sold a franchise-low 9,500 season tickets, 
and this week they drew the two smallest home crowds in their 
seven-year history on back-to-back nights. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's to be expected,'' new owner John Henry said. ``We're not  
winning any games. The only thing that bothers me about having 
small crowds is for the players. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the players' fault. It's not management's fault. This  
is all the result of decisions that were made a long time ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Marlins' misery began when Henry's predecessor, Wayne  
Huizenga, dismantled the 1997 World Series champions. Florida 
started to rebuild with youth last season, and this spring's 
horrible start is distressing because the players and management 
thought the worst was over. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course it's harder this year,'' second-year right fielder  
Mark Kotsay said. ``You lose 108 games, and you come in here 
expecting to do better, and then you do this crummy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Crummy'' is not the exact word Kotsay used, but it'll do. At  
midweek Florida ranked last in the NL in seven offensive 
categories, including runs, home runs, slugging percentage and 
on-base percentage. Pitching ranked last in five categories, and 
the Marlins' defense had allowed the most unearned runs. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Florida is 3-20 against right-handers, 1-8 in day  
games, 0-5 in one-run games, 0-4 in two-run games and 0-1 in extra 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
	New manager John Boles, who prepared for the season by reading  
articles about patience, described his team's record as bitterly 
disappointing. But he remains relentlessly upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys in the clubhouse are going to keep battling,'' Boles  
said. ``If there are people who are not of that mindset, then we 
change those people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boles' problem -- aside from hitting, pitching and defense -- is  
that his team is simply too young. Kevin Orie is the oldest 
infielder and Cliff Floyd the oldest outfielder. Both are 26. With 
Alex Fernandez struggling to recover from rotator cuff surgery and 
back on the disabled list, the 12 active pitchers have a total of 
77 career victories. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe if we got a couple of older guys, they would help us win  
some games, but why do that?'' said Mantei, 25. ``Just let these 
guys play. We're going to be a good team once everybody starts 
clicking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Don't look for that to happen this weekend, when Florida's  
feeble bats go against Darren Dreifort, Kevin Brown and Chan Ho 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Dodgers can't do anything more to us than what's been  
done,'' Boles said. ``It's not like their pitching is going to 
stymie us more than we've been stymied. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I can tell you is that we're going to keep fighting -- end  
of story.''

<HEADLINE> Saberhagen Leaves Game With Pain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Boston Red Sox right-hander Bret Saberhagen, who  
returned after missing his last start with stiffness in his 
shoulder, left tonight's game against Texas with tightness in his 
right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Saberhagen, who left his start April 24 against Cleveland with  
stiffness in his shoulder, allowed just three hits, while striking 
out five and not walking a batter in a scoreless, 43-pitch effort. 
After taking the mound in the top of the fourth, he spoke with 
plate umpire Rick Reed before walking off the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	The club announced during the fourth inning that he left due to  
``tightness in his shoulder.'' No further information was 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	Derek Lowe replaced him.  
</P>
<P>
	Saberhagen, who missed most of the 1996 and '97 seasons  
following shoulder surgery, was 15-8 last year. He won the Cy Young 
Award with Kansas City in 1985 and '89.

<HEADLINE> NHL Sets Draft Drawing for May 16 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NHL will conduct its draft drawing on  
Sunday, May 16 to determine the order of selection for the first 12 
picks in the Entry Draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11 teams who missed the Stanley Cup playoffs -- or the clubs  
that acquired first-round picks from those teams -- will participate 
in the drawing along with the expansion Atlanta Thrashers. 
</P>
<P>
	The drawing is a weighted lottery system that limits teams from  
moving up more than four positions in the draft order. That would 
restrict the top pick to the four clubs with the fewest 
regular-season points -- the New York Islanders, Tampa Bay, 
Vancouver and Nashville -- or Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the weighted lottery system, Tampa Bay, whose 47 points  
was the lowest total in the league this season, has the greatest 
chance at the top pick with 26 percent. Atlanta and Vancouver both 
have a 16.9 percent chance, the Islanders a 10.8 percent chance and 
Nashville an 8.3 percent chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Other teams participating in the drawing and their chances for  
advancing are Washington (6.4), Los Angeles (4.8), Chicago (3.7), 
Calgary (2.7), Montreal (1.9), the New York Rangers (1.1) and 
Florida (0.5). As part of the Pavel Bure trade, Florida has the 
option to give Vancouver its No. 1 pick this year or next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Entry Draft is scheduled for Saturday, June 26 at Boston.

<HEADLINE> Teachers Try To Explain Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most of Les Gambee's students at East  
Rochester High School barely remember the 1991 Persian Gulf War. 
They may know something of Vietnam from their parents or textbooks. 
They regard the Civil War as ancient history. 
</P>
<P>
	But the current conflict in Kosovo is real -- it's on television,  
in the newspapers, on the Internet. And Gambee is determined that 
his students achieve a good understanding of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their biggest question was why are we there, why are we  
bombing?'' said Gambee, who has designed a Web site on the Balkan 
fighting for his 25 government students at the suburban Rochester, 
N.Y., school. ``There was not a simple answer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. educators, often lacking background on the Balkan region's  
underlying ethnic, political and religious differences, find they 
must try new ways of educating their students about a part of the 
world they know little about. They are using Internet pages or 
building their own, and seeking the expertise of community leaders 
and scholars, as well as news reports. Some are simply shying away 
from what can be an emotional topic, but those who take on the task 
say it's worth it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Civil War is very long in the past,'' said Gambee. ``It's  
very hard for some students to realize the depth of destruction and 
despair in an event that happened over 100 years ago. Students tend 
to view this as more reality based.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Along with a seven-page briefing book he created, Gambee's  
students study with the Web site, which features maps, news 
articles and a history of the conflict that has led the United 
States and other NATO allied countries to launch air strikes 
against Yugoslav forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo is a Serbian province in Yugoslavia that is heavily  
populated by ethnic Albanians. Serbian leaders in Belgrade are 
trying to reassert their authority over the formerly autonomous 
region. The nations that united in the World War II era have joined 
the conflict, siding with the Kosovo Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	For such a story, the news media, especially print, have always  
helped classroom teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Textbooks and many other educational materials are not very  
timely,'' said David Goddy, editor in chief of Scholastic's 
classroom magazines. ``There are teachers who want to be able to 
get kids to talk about what is happening today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet is creating even more resources beyond having  
students clip articles from newspapers and magazines. Gambee admits 
his Web site is a chance to supervise what students are reading. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to tell them what to believe,'' he said. ``But  
with the Internet, they can get into trouble faster with bad 
information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The wealth of information deserves careful scrutiny from  
teachers too, said Anna Pavichevich, a spokeswoman for the Serbian 
National Defense Council of America in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Her third-grade son has come home crying, believing he is a bad  
person because his class discussed reported atrocities being 
committed by Serbs against the Kosovo Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything comes down to good and bad,'' said Pavichevich, who  
is a teacher at a Chicago high school. ``There are lot of levels. 
It's human rights; it's economic rights. Teachers don't have enough 
time to educate themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's difficult to shield children from violence in this  
particular topic, Gambee said. Newscasts often show images of 
Albanian children who are hungry and scared as they wait at a 
refugee mission; those photos can start the discussion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes adults don't think children can handle it but they  
can,'' he said. ``There's a gentleness you have to use. You can't 
slam them in the face with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scholars can be a resource for teachers, said Judy Breck,  
content master of homeworkcentral.com, an educational Web site that 
uses graduate students in relevant fields to glean the Internet for 
information on Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Their expertise helps educators focus on history, she said,  
adding that news sources tend to feature current events over 
historical background. 
</P>
<P>
	Emmanuel Skoulas, an adjunct instructor at Queens College who  
teaches Western civilization, said teachers must review history 
before using terms such as ``ethnic cleansing,'' which is NATO's 
description of what Serbs are doing to the ethnic Albanians of 
Kosovo, generally meaning driving out, killing or otherwise 
nullifying the influence or presence of an ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the region's boundaries have been redefined repeatedly,  
leading to ethnic groups living within the national borders of 
other groups they might be hostile to, and students of the subject 
need to understand that. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a simple war,'' said Skoulas. ``It's a war that goes  
back to the 14th and 15th centuries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pavichevich added that community groups can help by lecturing  
schools. But many teachers, she adds, just as soon avoid the issue 
in Chicago, where they are large number of Eastern European 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	``They take the position we're not going to bring that into the  
school,'' she said. ``Even some small child with an 
American-sounding last name might have a close family member who is 
involved in this conflict.''

<HEADLINE> FCC Staff Mulls SBC-Ameritech Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumers and competition must be protected  
before SBC Communications and Ameritech are allowed to merge into 
the nation's largest local phone company, a top FCC official said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Communications Commission staff opened a two-day hearing  
Thursday on what possible conditions could be placed on the $57 
billion merger to satisfy their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Krattenmaker, who is leading the staff review, believes  
that the companies, whose local phone territories abut, -- probably 
would eliminate their biggest potential competitor -- each other -- 
by merging. 
</P>
<P>
	Staff members also raised concerns that an SBC-Ameritech would  
be so powerful it would discourage other companies from invading 
the merged companies 13-state local phone territory to provide 
competing services. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC and Ameritech attorneys rejected both concerns, contending  
that the merger would benefit consumers and competition. The 
companies, they said, must merge to become more efficient and 
financially able to do business in markets outside their region, 
which they said the companies cannot do separately. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies also need to merge to become major players in the  
global telecommunications market, the attorneys said. AT&AMP;T and 
other rivals are merging for the same reasons, they added. 
</P>
<P>
	``This merger is about growth,'' said Ameritech's counsel,  
Richard Hetke. 
</P>
<P>
	But Krattenmaker said FCC staff members are looking into  
possible conditions because they had tentatively concluded that the 
merger ``flunks the public interest test.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The current mission ... is to devise conditions that can  
transform the merger to one that is on balance beneficial,'' 
Krattenmaker added. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC's five commissioners hope to make a decision this summer  
on the $57 billion merger, which has been approved by the Justice 
Department. The merger must be supported by at least three FCC 
commissioners to be approved. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman Bill Kennard indicated he would like to see the deal  
move forward, saying he has asked the agency's staff to continue 
work on ``a set of conditions designed to address the public 
interest concerns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for SBC and Ameritech said their companies don't  
believe any conditions are warranted but indicated they are willing 
to make some concessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Atkinson, another key figure in the FCC's review, said  
the commission staff had three goals to guide possible conditions: 
</P>
<P>
	--Ensure a combined SBC-Ameritech aggressively competes outside  
its 13-state local region, particularly for residential and small 
business customers, who now have little choice of local providers. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ensure other companies that own their own telecommunications  
networks can compete inside the combined company's 13-state region. 
</P>
<P>
	--Hold SBC and Ameritech to any commitments they make.  
</P>
<P>
	SBC and Ameritech, supported by major telephone unions, say the  
merger will spur local phone competition and possibly lower prices, 
accelerate the roll-out of high-speed Internet access and data 
services and create jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups, AT&AMP;T, MCI WorldCom, Sprint and others want the  
FCC to block the merger, contending it would thwart local phone 
competition and the prospect of lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13 states involved in the proposed merger are Arkansas,  
California, Connecticut, Kansas, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, 
Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> Shell Earns Smaller Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Lower prices for crude oil and reduced profit  
margins in petrochemicals and refining caused a 17 percent drop in 
first-quarter earnings for the Royal Dutch-Shell Group of Cos. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income, adjusted for current inventory values, slipped to  
$1.61 billion in the January-March period from $1.95 billion in the 
same period last year, the Anglo-Dutch company reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales fell 13 percent to $31.4 billion from $36 billion a year  
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the recent recovery in global crude prices and continued  
efforts to cut costs helped Shell beat the earnings forecasts of 
its quarterly results. Analysts had expected earnings to be between 
$975 million and $1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	At midday in London, Shell shares were up 6.5 percent from  
Wednesday's close in heavy trading. In Amsterdam, Royal Dutch 
shares rose 3.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	A mid-March pledge by oil-exporting countries to trim crude  
production by 2 million barrels a day helped push the benchmark 
Brent oil price above $14.50 by the end of the quarter. Spot prices 
have continued rising, with Brent reaching $16.38 per barrel 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Shell warned that this tighter supply might not last.  
</P>
<P>
	``Production discipline may be difficult to maintain if prices  
do rise, and a new phase of price weakness could be triggered,'' 
the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil sales, Shell's biggest business segment, fell 6  
percent in volume compared to the same January-March period of 
1998. Domestic problems in Nigeria, a major supply source, and 
reduced production levels in Australia, Gabon and Norway were 
contributing factors. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas volumes increased by 10 percent, due largely to  
higher output in the United States and a colder winter in Europe 
that boosted demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of refined petroleum products fell 15 percent because of  
greater competition. Chemical sales plunged 66 percent, due partly 
to increased industry capacity and the lingering effects of 
recession in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Shell said that some chemical markets have improved amid signs  
of tightening supply in some regions.

<HEADLINE> Abortion Foe Charged in Slaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- An abortion foe who is the subject of an  
international manhunt was charged with murder Thursday in the 
slaying of a doctor who was cut down in his kitchen by a sniper's 
bullet. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal and state arrest warrants were issued for James C. Kopp,  
44, of St. Albans, Vt. His whereabouts are unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have probable cause to believe this man, James Kopp, is  
responsible for the death of Dr. Barnett Slepian,'' FBI agent 
Bernard Tolbert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have been searching for Kopp since shortly after  
the Oct. 23 slaying. Up until Thursday, however, they had described 
him only as a material witness wanted for questioning -- not a 
suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to a state charge of murder, Kopp faces a federal  
charge of violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act 
by using deadly force against an abortion doctor. Both charges 
carry up to life in prison. The federal charge also carries a fine 
of up to $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The newly filed charges will intensify the ongoing international  
manhunt, Tolbert said. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to the new charges, Canadian officials confirmed  
that Kopp is a suspect in sniper shootings that injured abortion 
doctors in November in Vancouver, British Columbia; Winnipeg, 
Manitoba; and Hamilton, Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators would not divulge the evidence against Kopp but  
said last month's discovery of a scope-equipped rifle buried near 
the Slepian home represented a major breakthrough. Slepian, 52, was 
shot with a rifle. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have said they believe the weapon may have been  
buried in advance of the shooting, with the killer digging it up to 
fire the shot, then reburying it and fleeing. 
</P>
<P>
	Kopp also has been linked, through DNA testing, to a strand of  
hair found near where the sniper fired, law enforcement sources 
have said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicknamed the ``Atomic Dog'' in anti-abortion circles, Kopp had  
been arrested in several states since 1990 for protesting abortion. 
His car was spotted in Slepian's suburban Amherst neighborhood in 
the weeks before the shooting, and was found abandoned at New 
Jersey's Newark International Airport in December, investigators 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kopp's stepmother, who married Kopp's father when Kopp was in  
his 30s, said Thursday from her home in Irving, Texas: ``I would 
like to see him come forward and clear his name if he's not guilty, 
and if he's guilty, to contact a priest and make his amends with 
society, face what he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kopp is now the second anti-abortion activist being sought by  
the FBI as a suspect in a fatal attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Rudolph has been on the run since the January 1998 bombing  
of a Birmingham, Ala., abortion clinic that killed an off-duty 
police officer and maimed a nurse. He also is charged in three 
Atlanta attacks, including the 1996 Olympic bombing that killed one 
person.

<HEADLINE> Nuggets Improve, but Disappoint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- With only one winning season in the '90s, maybe a  
change in scenery will help the Denver Nuggets change their 
misfortune. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nuggets rounded out a dismal decade with a 14-36 record in  
their final season in McNichols Arena, which will be torn down in 
favor of the $160 million Pepsi Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Denver improved its victory total in a lockout-shortened  
season, the Nuggets struggled to jell under first-year head coach 
Mike D'Antoni. They beat just three playoff-bound teams, never won 
more than two in a row and finished with seven straight losses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite frankly, I think we need a break,'' guard Chauncey  
Billups said. ``It was a long 90 days ... a long 90 days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The toll of playing four and sometimes five games a week was  
particularly difficult on the young Nuggets as they tried to find 
chemistry with several new players such as Billups, Nick Van Exel 
and Antonio McDyess. 
</P>
<P>
	Also hampering their progress was the loss of first-round draft  
pick Raef LaFrentz, who averaged 13.8 points and 7.6 rebounds in 12 
games before suffering season-ending knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Raef was healthy, we beat the Lakers and Utah at home,''  
forward Danny Fortson said. ``You need to have an extra big guy out 
there. Once he went down, it was hard to recover.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LaFrentz's absence forced the Nuggets to play the 6-foot-7  
Fortson in the middle, where he often gave up five inches to 
opposing centers. He responded gamely, however, finishing fourth in 
the NBA in rebounding with 11.6 boards per game. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's other main highlight was the successful return of  
McDyess, who spent a mediocre season in Phoenix before the Nuggets 
lured him back with a six-year, $67.5 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess, originally acquired by Denver in a draft-day trade in  
1995, averaged a career-best 21 points and 10.7 rebounds, but was 
clearly drained after fighting constant double teams while playing 
nearly 39 minutes a night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wears on your body and makes your legs tired,'' McDyess  
said. ``At the end, I didn't have any legs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finding someone to complement McDyess is one of several key  
issues for Denver in the offseason. Owner Bill Laurie, who bought 
the Nuggets last month, also must decide whether to bring back Van 
Exel and D'Antoni. 
</P>
<P>
	Laurie has remained noncommittal about D'Antoni, a coaching star  
in Italy before his move to the NBA. The players believe D'Antoni 
deserves at least one more season to prove himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a rookie coach taking over a team that had won 11  
games,'' Billups said. ``You've got to give the man a chance. 
Everybody in this locker room knows how good he is. We're all 
behind him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Van Exel, the petulant point guard is a free agent this  
summer but says his top priority is re-signing with the Nuggets. 
General manager Dan Issel has defended Van Exel against critics who 
say he is moody and has a shoot-first, pass-later mentality. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dan's pretty much told me that he would love to re-sign me, so  
he's given me all the confidence in the world,'' Van Exel said. ``I 
think I can really trust him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Exel, who stands to make more money by staying in Denver,  
also said he also feels obligated to McDyess after lobbying his 
friend to turn down more money in Phoenix and sign with the 
Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
	``After begging him to come here and telling him we would make  
the playoffs, it really didn't happen this year,'' Van Exel said. 
``To beg him to come here and then to just abandon him, I don't 
think that'd be being a friend.''

<HEADLINE> Big Plans for Star Wars Opening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Come May 19, Seth Miller and his staff hope to  
be far, far away from work, kicking back with popcorn, a soda and a 
big screen full of the return of ``Star Wars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Don't look for many ``Star Wars'' buffs at work on the day the  
latest installment in the galactic epic is released. They're 
closing down offices, renting out theaters and taking weeks of 
vacation to stand in line for tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	By one estimate, more than 2 million workers could skip work for  
the movie's opening. A national holiday is taking shape. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing's that important that we can't skip work for the  
day,'' says Miller, president of Boston-based Miller Systems, an 
Internet consulting company with a staff of seven. ``As soon as the 
date was announced for the movie, I decided that had to be a 
company holiday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon Herman told his parents that he won't be working at his  
family's video production company most of this month because of the 
movie, the first release of a ``Star Wars'' film since 1983. 
Tickets go on sale May 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've waited 16 years,'' he says, standing his ground in the  
ticket line outside a New York theater as fellow fans around him 
dueled with light-sabers. ``I can't wait any longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baby boomers grew up with the Jedi and are now calling the shots  
in many offices. The ``Star Wars'' lexicon is already part of the 
workplace culture in many places, particularly in high-tech fields. 
``May the Force be with you!'' co-workers say. ``Try not. Do ... or 
do not. There is no try.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ric Edelman, head of Edelman Financial Services in Fairfax, Va.,  
is having the three earlier ``Star Wars'' films shown at his firm -- 
twice -- having discovered that 7 percent of his 90 employees hadn't 
seen any of them. He also hopes to take his entire staff to see the 
new movie. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those of us who've seen them find it hard to believe there's  
anybody in America who hasn't,'' Edelman says. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheree Franklin, a human resources director at GoldMine Software  
of Pacific Palisades, Calif., watches the trilogy at least twice a 
month. During opening week, she and her co-workers will see the 
movie when their boss rents a theater. 
</P>
<P>
	When Wil Schroter heard the movie was coming, he quickly rented  
a 500-seat theater in Columbus, Ohio, for employees at his Internet 
consulting firm, NGDA Interactive Communications, and their guests. 
But their enthusiasm surprised even Schroter, a diehard fan. 
</P>
<P>
	He got requests for 100 tickets in 10 minutes -- the biggest  
response he has ever gotten to a company e-mail. To complete the 
May 21 festivities, he is throwing a pre-screening office party and 
encouraging the staff to work in costume that day. 
</P>
<P>
	Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas Inc., an employment agency,  
estimates 2.2 million employees could skip work to see the movie on 
opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	Won't that hurt productivity? Economist Sung Won Sohn of Wells  
Fargo in Minneapolis says any dip will be offset by a boost in 
spending on things such as tickets, toys or popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, you won't catch him taking the day off or standing in  
line to see the movie. He's a ``Star Wars'' fan but says he will 
wait a week or two. 
</P>
<P>
	``My time is more valuable,'' he says with a chuckle.

<HEADLINE> Barnesandnoble.com Plans IPO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Barnesandnoble.com is going ahead with plans for  
an initial public offering of stock despite signs that Wall 
Street's frenzy for Internet-related businesses may be waning. 
</P>
<P>
	The online retailer -- jointly owned by bookseller Barnes &AMP; Noble  
and German media conglomerate Bertelsmann -- said Thursday that it 
hopes to raise about $300 million in the IPO, selling 25 million 
shares, or about 18 percent of the company, for about $12 each. A 
date for the offering hasn't been set. 
</P>
<P>
	The money will help the New York-based company in the fierce  
battle for market share against Amazon.com and the swarms of 
smaller outfits vying for a piece of the burgeoning online 
retailing business. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks, especially IPOs, have been the darling of Wall  
Street for the past year, with investors embracing just about any 
company with online operations or even online plans. Many IPOs have 
doubled in the first days of trading and kept on going. 
</P>
<P>
	But this may not be the right time to take an Internet company  
public. For example, the online real estate firm Comps.com sold 
shares earlier this week for $15 each, but had fallen to $13.50 by 
Thursday afternoon on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Internet ``stalwarts'' such as Amazon.com and eBay  
have slumped recently as investors shifted away from high-flying 
technology issues in favor of long-neglected industrial companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, the euphoria for Internet stocks is a little  
overdone,'' said Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at 
George K. Baum &AMP; Co., in Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, it is safe to say that barnesandnoble.com has a better  
name than an unknown xyz.com company,'' he said. ``But this market 
is still oversaturated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some analysts say that barnesandnoble.com's IPO may do  
well merely because it is a well-known name and investors have long 
liked the online-bookselling concept. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the last week, we've seen some lower quality IPOs,'' said  
Linda R. Killian, who evaluates IPOs for Renaissance Capital Corp. 
``These companies aren't unique in any way. Barnesandnoble.com is 
not like those.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like many online companies, barnesandnoble.com is a  
fast-growing, but money-losing business. 
</P>
<P>
	In reporting its IPO plans to the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, the company said it lost $20.2 million in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales, however, rose to $32.3 million, an increase of 25 percent  
from the fourth quarter of 1998 and up 259 percent from year-ago 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The online bookseller also said it now has 1.7 million  
customers, with more than 450,000 shopping for the first time 
during the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	But barnesandnoble.com still lags behind Amazon.com, which is  
quickly building itself into an online shopping hub with a broad 
array of books, music, video, gifts and auctions. Amazon's customer 
tally was 8 million customer at the end of the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnesandnoble.com stock will trade under the symbol ``BNBN'' on  
the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second time in a year that plans have been announced  
to sell shares of barnesandnoble.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Last August, Barnes &AMP; Noble announced its intention to take its  
online operation public, but decided to postpone the offering after 
Bertelsmann purchased a 50 percent stake in the company.

<HEADLINE> Gov. Ventura Refuses Prayer Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Gov. Jesse Ventura, who once used his  
office to proclaim Rolling Stones Day in Minnesota, refused to sign 
a proclamation making Thursday a day of prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura broke with the practice of his predecessors, who  
typically proclaimed a prayer day in conjunction with the National 
Day of Prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe in the separation of church and state,'' Ventura  
said. ``We all have our own religious beliefs. There are people out 
there who are atheists, who don't believe at all. ... They are all 
citizens of Minnesota and I have to respect that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Minnesota Family Council criticized Ventura's decision,  
saying that the prayer proclamation dates to 1795, when President 
George Washington declared a day of public thanksgiving and prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would think the governor at the very least would give equal  
recognition to a day of prayer as he gave to Mick Jagger and the 
Rolling Stones,'' said Tom Prichard, the group's president. 
</P>
<P>
	Rolling Stones Day was Feb. 15.

of MediaOne Group, the nation's fourth-largest cable company.

<HEADLINE> Bush Criticizes Clinton on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Republican presidential prospect George W.  
Bush said Thursday that the United States must ``ferociously'' seek 
victory in Yugoslavia, and criticized President Clinton for his 
decision ruling out the use of ground troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it said, `We're coming to fight you with one hand',''  
the early GOP front-runner said in an interview with The Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The standoff with Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic has become  
an early touchstone of the 2000 presidential race, with a large 
field of GOP candidates trying to stake out positions on the 
headline-grabbing conflict. Arizona Sen. John McCain drew attention 
to his campaign by being the first to criticize Clinton for ruling 
out ground troops. Rep. John Kasich of Ohio urged mediation. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush first moved cautiously to react to the crisis, but  
eventually said he supported the mission and questioned Clinton's 
decision to rule out ground troops. Sitting in his office at the 
pink granite capitol building Thursday, the Texas governor offered 
what may be his most detailed and critical assessment of the 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke as the United States, its Western allies and Russia  
agreed on the outlines of a peace formula for Kosovo. Moscow 
endorsed deployment of an international security force to oversee 
the peaceful return of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, son of the president who formed the Persian Gulf War  
coalition, said Clinton failed to clearly define the mission early 
on and questioned whether he has followed the exit-strategy 
doctrine established by President Bush and Gen. Colin Powell, then 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any commander-in-chief has got to understand the true  
principles of the Powell Doctrine, which are: What are the 
objectives? How do you achieve the objective? And how do you 
end?,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers are ``frustrated and concerned'' about the mission and  
those issues, he said, and that explains why a divided House failed 
to support the U.S.-led NATO mission in votes last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Congress is sending some mixed signals and I think there  
appears to be concerns by congressional leaders as to mission, 
objectives and the exit strategy,'' Bush said. ``I happen to think 
it's important for Milosevic to hear one voice, and that we're 
serious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said he would have voted to support the mission if he had  
been in Congress, if only to send a signal that the United States 
stands united behind its troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to have one objective in mind and that is to achieve  
the goals and to do so ferociously,'' Bush said. Like Clinton, he 
says the goals are to remove the Serbs from Kosovo, return the 
ethnic Albanians to their homes and insert a peacekeeping force. 
``It's important that NATO be involved'' with the peacekeeping 
effort, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an awesome responsibility to be commander-in-chief ...  
but the commander-in-chief has a responsibility, once the troops 
are committed, to win. To win,'' he said, putting added emphasis on 
the final two words. ``Once people's lives are at risk, once a 
decision has been made, then the plans have to be such as to 
minimize the loss by force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Has Clinton done that?  
</P>
<P>
	``Time will tell,'' Bush said. ``I thought saying right off the  
bat that we won't use land troops was a mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was pleased that Jesse Jackson gained the release of  
three American POWs, including two with ties to Texas. But he 
suggested that Milosevic used the mission to undermine U.S. 
resolve. ``Mr. Milosevic (is) a public relations master,'' Bush 
said. ``The fact that he's on CNN smiling with these POWs should 
not lessen the resolve of the United States.''

<HEADLINE> Alleged Cop Torture Victim on Stand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Haitian immigrant Abner Louima told a jury  
Thursday that police officers who arrested him in 1997 took turns 
beating him before one sexually brutalized him with a stick in a 
police station bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	The enraged officer rammed the stick up Louima's rectum and then  
jammed it in Louima's mouth, he said in a halting voice at the 
federal trial of five white officers charged with violating his 
civil rights. The incident prompted demonstrations against police 
brutality and inflamed racial tensions in the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking the stand on the third day of the trial, Louima at one  
point was asked to rise and identify the officer. He slowly scanned 
the courtroom before pointing at Officer Justin Volpe. Louima's 
finger shook visibly; Volpe sat expressionless. 
</P>
<P>
	After the attack, Louima testified, Volpe warned Louima that if  
he ``ever talked to anyone about what they did to me, he'd kill me 
and my family and he was not joking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe is one of four officers charged with beating Louima after  
mistakenly thinking he had sucker-punched Volpe as police tried to 
disperse a rowdy crowd outside a Brooklyn nightclub on Aug. 9, 
1997; a fifth officer is charged with covering up the assault. 
Prosecutors revealed this week that Louima's cousin was the man who 
punched Volpe. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe also is accused of sodomizing Louima in a fit of rage.  
Louima was hospitalized with severe internal injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Louima, 32, the government's star witness, slipped  
into the courtroom unobtrusively, wearing an oversized, dark blue 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Under questioning by Assistant U.S. Attorney Alan Vinegrad,  
Louima said his night began quietly. He described leaving his 
security guard job early, stopping at his parents' house and then 
joining his brother, cousin and friends for an outing to a popular 
nightspot, Club Rendezvous. 
</P>
<P>
	As the club closed and a large crowd spilled onto the street at  
about 4 a.m., Louima said, he noticed an injured man surrounded by 
police. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was one guy who had some blood on his face and was  
complaining that he got hit by a cop,'' Louima testified. 
Bystanders grew angry, he continued, and ``I was very angry, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Louima said he commented that police are ``not supposed to hit  
the person because they have rights.'' After that, he heard someone 
behind him say, ``Shut up,'' then felt himself being knocked to the 
ground and handcuffed. 
</P>
<P>
	Louima described being taken away in a patrol car to a nearby  
intersection where four white police officers -- identified earlier 
by prosecutors as Volpe, Thomas Bruder, Thomas Wiese and Charles 
Schwarz -- began pummeling him. One, he said, taunted him: ``Stupid 
nigger. I'm going to give you a lesson on how to respect a cop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following a second beating by two of the officers, Louima said,  
he was taken into the stationhouse, where one officer -- identified 
by Schwarz by prosecutors -- removed Louima's belt, the witness 
said. With his pants down at his knees and his hands still cuffed, 
the officer led him into the bathroom with Volpe following behind, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Louima said he noticed Volpe grab something near a trash can  
before being tossed face down near a toilet. Volpe kicked him in 
the groin, and then the mouth when he started to yell, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Louima also testified that he lied to reporters when he said  
that an officer had said ``It's Giuliani time,'' a reference to the 
law-and-order policies of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. He said two men 
who visited him at the hospital had told him to make the statement 
to attract attention. 
</P>
<P>
	In opening statements earlier in the week, Volpe's attorney,  
Marvyn Kornberg, said Louima had 150 million reasons to lie about 
the entire incident -- one for every dollar in his civil claim 
against the city.

<HEADLINE> EU: China Pulls Back on Trade Terms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Domestic resistance to opening China's markets  
has caused Chinese leaders to retreat from trade concessions the 
United States thought it won last month, a senior EU official said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The assessment by European Commission Vice President Leon  
Brittan confirms that momentum for getting China into the World 
Trade Organization has slowed since U.S. President Bill Clinton 
rejected broad market-opening offers Premier Zhu Rongji made in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Zhu's return to China two weeks ago, opposition among  
protectionist officials has coalesced. A U.S. negotiating team 
came, but left after running into new obstacles. The powerful 
telecommunications minister tendered his resignation, partly in 
protest over the Washington concessions, Western diplomats and 
industry insiders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brittan reported that an EU trade negotiating team ``made no new  
progress'' in 10 days of talks with the Chinese. Brittan, who is 
the EU's acting trade minister, spent two days presenting EU 
demands to Chinese leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was not expecting dramatic results now, and of course I am  
very well aware of the domestic pressures on the Chinese 
government,'' Brittan told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	In Geneva, meanwhile, the WTO was trying anew on Thursday to  
break a deadlock over selection of a new director-general. The 
meeting -- the fourth since last Friday -- comes nearly a week after 
Renato Ruggiero left office and a year after he announced his 
intention to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Brittan said that in a meeting Wednesday, ``Premier Zhu stressed  
the major concessions made by China in Washington and indicated 
that he had a limited room for maneuver.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During Zhu's April 8 meeting with Clinton, the two sides came as  
close as they have to striking a deal in 13 years of fitful 
bargaining by China to enter world trade's rule-making body. 
Afterwards, the United States released a list of stunning 
concessions by China, throwing open previously closed sectors such 
as agriculture, telecommunications and insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Trade Minister Shi Guangsheng, who spent 3 1/2 hours with  
Brittan on Thursday, afterwards told Chinese reporters that the 
U.S. list included issues still under negotiation and American 
demands China has never agreed to, the official Xinhua News Agency 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Brittan and his negotiating team found Chinese negotiators  
balking over the 51 percent foreign ownership in telecommunications 
and insurance ventures the United States believed China agreed to 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
	China's offer now stands ``somewhat short'' of the ``high-water  
mark'' claimed by Washington, Brittan said. ``We too would like to 
get back to where the U.S. thought it was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. negotiators who left Beijing last week had a similar  
experience. Chinese negotiators backpedaled on reinsurance and 
brought up new restrictions on access to the telecommunications 
services, said a Western diplomat familiar with the talks. The 
diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no doubt at all there has been criticism in China on  
the extent to which they have gone with the Americans,'' Brittan 
said. He added that China may need ``a period of consolidation, 
reflection and consultation'' before it can begin serious 
bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the setbacks, the EU wants China in WTO by year's end,  
Brittan said. U.S. negotiators, who return to China in 10 days, had 
hoped to reach an agreement by June. 
</P>
<P>
	In talks Thursday, Foreign Trade Minister Shi Guangsheng  
provisionally offered to lower tariffs on some goods Brittan did 
not identify. If agreed to by Zhu, the lower tariffs would be 
progress, but there was a ``considerable way to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was inconceivable'' a final deal will be struck in time for  
the visit next week by German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who 
holds the EU's rotating presidency, Brittan added.

<HEADLINE> Big Plans for Star Wars Opening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Seth Miller has been preparing his clients for a  
month. Come May 19, he and his staff hope to be in a galaxy far, 
far away, soaking in the return of Star Wars. 
</P>
<P>
	Call 'em geeks. Call 'em hip. Just don't look for many Star Wars  
buffs at work on The Big Day, the Wednesday release of the latest 
episode in the galactic epic. 
</P>
<P>
	They're closing down offices, renting out theaters, taking weeks  
of vacation to stand in line for tickets. By one estimate, more 
than 2 million workers could skip work for the opening. An informal 
national holiday is brewing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing's that important that we can't skip work for the  
day,'' said Miller, president of Boston-based Miller Systems, an 
Internet consulting company with a staff of seven. ``As soon as the 
date was announced for the movie, I decided that had to be a 
company holiday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Brandon Herman, May is a self-declared holiday. He told his  
parents that he won't be working at his family's video production 
company most of the month due to the movie -- the first release of a 
Star Wars film since 1983. Tickets go on sale May 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've waited 16 years,'' he said earnestly, standing his ground  
in the ticket line outside a New York cinema as fellow fans around 
him dueled with light-sabers. ``I can't wait any longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once in a while, news, sports or scandals intrude on work life.  
Before the World Series began night games in 1971, fans kept radios 
on at work during games. O.J. Simpson's murder trial distracted 
workers for months; the verdict stopped work nationwide in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``They tend to be events that feel close to home, that feel  
apocalyptic in nature, overwhelming,'' said Talmadge Wright, an 
associate professor of sociology at Loyola University in Chicago 
and a follower of pop culture. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks partly to a service economy that venerates creativity,  
the Star Wars lexicon is already part of many workplaces' culture, 
particularly in high-tech fields. ``May the Force be with you!'', 
co-workers say. ``Try not. Do... or do not. There is no try.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Especially for Baby Boomers, who've grown up with the Jedi and  
now call the shots in many offices, it's a no-brainer to decide to 
shut down the company for the long-awaited movie. 
</P>
<P>
	Ric Edelman, head of Edelman Financial Services in Fairfax, Va.,  
is having the three earlier Star Wars films shown at his firm -- 
twice -- having discovered 7 percent of his 90 employees hadn't seen 
any. He also hopes to take his entire staff to see the new film. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those of us who've seen them find it hard to believe there's  
anybody in America who hasn't,'' roars Edelman. 
</P>
<P>
	Lesley Roberts, Edelman's human resources director and one of  
the 7 percent, is taking her education good-naturedly. She 
describes the excitement as ``interesting.'' Star Wars talk has 
``become more a part of my daily routine,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheree Franklin also finds it hard to concentrate on her work  
these days -- but she's ecstatic. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Franklin, a human resources director who watches the trilogy  
at least twice a month, has been taking a daily break for months to 
look at Web sites devoted to the movie. During opening week, she 
and other employees at GoldMine Software of Pacific Palisades, 
Calif., will see the movie when their boss rents a theater. 
</P>
<P>
	When Wil Schroter heard that the movie was coming, he quickly  
rented a 500-seat theater in Columbus, Ohio, for employees at his 
Internet consulting firm, NGDA Interactive Communications, and 
their guests. But their enthusiasm surprised even Schroter, a 
die-hard fan. 
</P>
<P>
	When he announced his coup, he got requests for 100 tickets in  
10 minutes -- the biggest response he'd ever gotten to a company 
e-mail. To complete the May 21 festivities, he's throwing a 
pre-screening office party and encouraging the staff to work in 
costume that day. 
</P>
<P>
	Office costumes, playing hooky? Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas  
Inc., an employment agency, estimates 2.2 million employees could 
skip work to see the movie on opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	Some might ask if all the hoopla won't hurt productivity. But  
economist Sung Won Sohn, of Wells Fargo in Minneapolis, says any 
dip in labor will be offset by a boost in spending, be it on 
tickets, toys or popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, you won't catch him taking the day off or standing in  
line to see the movie. He's a Star Wars fan but says he'll wait a 
week or two. 
</P>
<P>
	``My time is more valuable,'' he chuckled.

<HEADLINE> 'Cider House' Staged Off-Broadway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In ``The Cider House Rules,'' orphan Homer Wells  
wonders if he can be the hero of his own life. It's a personal and 
moral dilemma audiences should find intriguing -- and more than a 
little moving. 
</P>
<P>
	The wide-eyed, innocent lad has plenty of opportunity to test  
his mettle in this ambitious stage adaptation of John Irving's 
sprawling novel that has made its way to New York after productions 
by the Seattle Repertory Company and the Mark Taper Forum in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	New Yorkers are seeing only part one of the show at  
off-Broadway's Atlantic Theater Company. Production of part two 
depends on the first half's reception. Judging from this terrific 
initial effort, the Atlantic should proceed immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Subtitled ``Here at St. Cloud's,'' the three-hour-plus  
production is story theater at its crowd-pleasing best. In fact, it 
takes the form a step further, artfully blending narrative and 
dialogue lifted directly from the book within adapter Peter 
Parnell's careful condensation of the voluminous plot. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort, directed by Tom Hulce and Jane Jones, is seamless,  
with 19 performers slipping in and out of multiple roles as quickly 
as they can change costumes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cider House'' is a big novel with big themes, told in an  
expansive, leisurely style that would do Charles Dickens proud. In 
fact, young Homer reveres David Copperfield, another orphan who 
makes his way in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Irving populates his novel with a parade of memorable characters  
who span more than half a century, from the 1880s into the days 
following World War II. Central to his tale is the relationship 
between Homer and Dr. Wilbur Larch, a man who does what he calls 
the Lord's work and the devil's work at St. Cloud's, an orphanage 
in rural Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Larch delivers unwanted babies -- and also aborts them, depending  
on the wishes of the mother. ``Here at St. Cloud's, I try to 
consider, with each rule I make or break, that my first priority is 
an orphan's future,'' Larch says. 
</P>
<P>
	Homer is the one true orphan at St. Cloud's, adopted and then  
returned by three different families. Larch, his two adoring nurses 
and an equally unadoptable female orphan named Melony become his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the three leads from the Los Angeles production have come  
with the show to New York -- and deservedly so. Josh Hamilton could 
not be better as the bewildered, sweet-tempered Homer, a young man 
whose convictions are tested daily by what he learns of Larch's 
doings at St. Cloud's. 
</P>
<P>
	Irving's novel doesn't take the easy way out in dealing with the  
question of abortion. The author clearly -- and clinically -- 
presents both sides of the argument, something Parnell also does in 
his stage version. 
</P>
<P>
	Jillian Armenante is nothing less than astonishing as the  
snarling, tomboyish Melony, who instructs Homer in the mysteries of 
sex. Armenante, a solidly built woman, barrels through the role 
with audacious authority. It is a brazen, career-defining 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	A ruddy Colm Meaney, a fine new addition, displays a determined  
yet kind manner that gives Larch moral weight, the authority to 
make life-and-death decisions at St. Cloud's. 
</P>
<P>
	What's curious about this ``Cider House Rules'' is that it  
leaves the audience hanging. The ``rules'' of the title are never 
introduced. They await explanation in the second half, which 
apparently Parnell, Hulce and Jones are revising extensively. Let's 
hope they work quickly. There is an audience eager to know what 
happens to Homer and his dealings with ``The Cider House Rules.''

<HEADLINE> Popes Romania Tour Seen As Historic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Pope John Paul II will break through another  
iron curtain Friday when he begins a three-day trip to Romania, the 
first visit by a pope to a country where Orthodox Christians 
predominate. 
</P>
<P>
	Not since the Great Schism of 1054, when the Eastern church  
definitively split from Rome, has a pope made such a trip. The 
Vatican is attaching particular symbolic importance to it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are talking centuries here,'' said papal spokesman Joaquin  
Navarro-Valls. ``The overused word 'historic' certainly applies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vatican, with bigger things in mind, has made a considerable  
concession. John Paul's stay will be limited to Bucharest, the 
capital, keeping him from Transylvania in the north, where a most 
of Romania's Catholics live. Romanian authorities feared a stop 
there could stir up religious passions. 
</P>
<P>
	But hundreds of thousands of Catholics, made up largely of  
Romania's Hungarian minority, were expected to reach the capital on 
special trains and buses to greet the pope during his three-day 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip is part of John Paul's drive for reconciliation among  
the various Christian denominations with the nearing of 2000, the 
start of Christianity's third millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	As John Paul has put it on several occasions, the church ``must  
learn to breathe again with its two lungs -- the Eastern one and the 
Western one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vatican also hopes the trip can open the way to a meeting  
with Russian Patriarch Alexy II and a possible trip to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 5 percent of Romania's 22 million people are Catholic while  
87 percent are at least nominally Orthodox. 
</P>
<P>
	Tensions between Catholics and Orthodox have come out into the  
open since the fall of communism, particularly with the 
re-emergence of Eastern-rite Catholic churches, which retain 
Orthodox-style liturgy but are loyal to the pope. 
</P>
<P>
	In Romania, as elsewhere in the Orthodox world, Eastern-rite  
Catholics are seeking the return of churches and other property 
that had been given to the Orthodox by the communists. 
</P>
<P>
	In turn, the Orthodox accuse the Catholics of poaching for  
converts. 
</P>
<P>
	Two ecumenical services underline efforts by both sides to show  
their good will. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul will attend a Divine Liturgy Sunday morning presided  
over by Orthodox Patriarch Teoctist. That afternoon, before 
returning to Rome, the pope will celebrate Mass in a Bucharest park 
with the patriarch attending the service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Romania trip, John Paul's 86th foreign tour, opens up a busy  
travel season for the pope, who will turn 79 on May 18. He will 
return to his native Poland for two weeks in June and then make a 
three-day trip to Armenia in July. 
</P>
<P>
	An Asian trip is also in the works later this year. Most foreign  
travel is expected to be put on hold next year, when John Paul will 
preside over yearlong millennium celebrations in Rome.

<HEADLINE> Jury Gets Marine Pilot Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- Prosecutors accused a Marine pilot  
Thursday of knowing full well that a tape he helped get rid of was 
going to be destroyed to impede an investigation into an air 
accident that killed 20 people in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who in this situation had the most to gain to make sure there  
wasn't any information about this flight?'' said prosecutor Maj. 
Daniel Daugherty in his closing statement at Capt. Richard Ashby's 
trial. ``He handed over that tape knowing it was going to be 
destroyed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby's lawyer, Frank Spinner, said Ashby had no criminal intent  
but had ``exercised poor judgment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the judge, Col. Alvin Keller, spent an hour instructing  
jurors, who will begin deliberating Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury must decide whether Ashby, 32, of Mission Viejo,  
Calif., is guilty of obstruction of justice and conspiracy. If 
convicted, he could be sent to prison for up to 10 years or 
dismissed from the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby was acquitted of manslaughter charges by a separate jury  
in March. If acquitted of these charges, he would start F-18 
fighter jet training. 
</P>
<P>
	After the jet hit the cable and landed, Ashby put the tape in  
his flight suit pocket. He retrieved it a few days later, wanting 
to see what was on it, he testified, but couldn't find a video 
player and handed it over to the navigator, Capt. Joseph 
Schweitzer, 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer, who was convicted of the charges Ashby faces and was  
kicked out of the Marines, said he threw the tape into a bonfire. 
Schweitzer said he feared that the tape, which included images of 
his face, would be played in the Italian media with scenes of the 
carnage.

<HEADLINE> Tipper Addresses Hollywood Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO (AP) -- Citizen action, not government regulation, is  
the way to force Hollywood to curb violence in its products, Tipper 
Gore said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're only going to respond if they hear from the  
larger community,'' the wife of Vice President Al Gore said. ``If 
we decrease our appetite for this violence ... and if we say no, 
that is kind of voting with your pocketbook.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore, author of the 1987 book ``Raising PG Kids in an  
X-Rated Society,'' pressed the music industry to label sexually 
explicit records in the 1980s. The industry began voluntary 
labeling in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore, appearing at the 100th annual California State  
Parent-Teacher Association Convention, spoke about the school 
shooting in Littleton, Colo., that left 15 dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Violent video games and movies are only part of a ``toxic  
culture.'' Easy access to guns and lack of structured activities 
for young people play a role in that culture, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't point the finger of blame only at the entertainment  
industry that markets violent entertainment to kids,'' she said in 
the speech.

<HEADLINE> Disney-Katzenberg Feud Very Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- After months of often tense negotiations,  
Jeffrey Katzenberg was comfortably back in the Disney family. His 
1988 contract to run the movie studio guaranteed him not just 
riches but the opportunity to continue working with a longtime 
friend, Michael Eisner. 
</P>
<P>
	In a handwritten note to the Walt Disney Co. chairman,  
Katzenberg thanked him for his ``extraordinary patience and care 
and understanding,'' and signed off, ``I'm deeply appreciative and 
do love you for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The love affair didn't last.  
</P>
<P>
	In makeshift courtrooms before a retired judge, divorce  
proceedings are under way, the messy aftermath of the 
disintegration of a Hollywood power marriage. It's the kind of feud 
the movie business rarely sees, one that breaks a sacred industry 
taboo: Never air grievances publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	Emotions have flared in what should have been a dry contract  
dispute. Katzenberg is suing Disney, alleging he's owed at least 
$250 million in an incentive bonus due to him after he left his job 
as head of the movie division in 1994, having overseen its 
triumphant return to animated-film supremacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney counters that Katzenberg forfeited that bonus because he  
resigned two years before the end of his six-year contract. 
Katzenberg went on to help Steven Spielberg and David Geffen form 
DreamWorks SKG, where he oversees animation. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides reached a partial settlement, which was sealed by the  
court but was said by the Hollywood Reporter to be a $77 million 
Disney check to Katzenberg. The case went to phase two April 26 -- 
arbitration by a retired Superior Court judge -- to decide how big 
Katzenberg's bonus should be. 
</P>
<P>
	It is there, in a lawyers' office on Avenue of Stars, that the  
drama and incongruity of the case is emerging -- from nasty memos on 
Disney stationery featuring a smiling Mickey Mouse, to bitter 
exchanges about ``personal animosity'' and ``the little midget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In opening statements, Katzenberg's attorney Bert Fields said  
this case of a mouse house divided boiled down to one thing: ``The 
personal animosity of one man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That would be Eisner, who became Disney's chairman in 1984 after  
resigning as president of Paramount Pictures when he wasn't 
promoted to chairman. One his first moves that year was to hire 
Katzenberg, his former Paramount movie chief, as chairman of 
Disney's film division. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Eisner and Katzenberg, Disney underwent a dramatic  
transition from a moribund film and theme park company to the 
entertainment behemoth of today. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, Katzenberg renegotiated his contract, getting a  
boatload of goodies, including $5 million for a Malibu beach house, 
a $750,000 annual salary, generous bonuses and, most importantly, 
what he says was the 2 percent incentive bonus on future income, 
payable when he left the company. 
</P>
<P>
	This, Katzenberg believes, would be a lump-sum estimate of a  
percentage of all the future rental income and theatrical 
re-release ticket sales of some of the biggest animation films of 
all time, including ``The Lion King'' and ``Aladdin,'' as well as a 
piece of every T-shirt, doll, game, mug and what-not sold in Disney 
Stores around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time the deal was completed, Disney was on the brink of  
great success in animation. Though slow to recognize the potential 
of animation, Katzenberg embraced it and got credit for its rebirth 
at Disney. 
</P>
<P>
	The warm feelings of the times were reflected in Katzenberg's  
1988 happy note to Eisner, recalling the negotiations as ``very 
difficult on all of us'' but thanking Eisner for his support. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been together a very long time,'' Katzenberg wrote. ``In  
fact, in terms of Hollywood timekeeping, about three lifetimes so 
far. I not only hope but I'm counting on us staying together 
forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forever lasted five years. By 1993, their relationship soured.  
</P>
<P>
	Eisner felt that Katzenberg was taking too much credit for  
animation and not enough responsibility for the lackluster 
live-action films. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, after company President Frank Wells died in a helicopter  
crash in 1994, Katzenberg approached Eisner about assuming Wells' 
position. Eisner says in his 1998 autobiography, ``Work in 
Progress,'' that the request came just 36 hours after Wells' death, 
leaving him ``stunned'' at Katzenberg's insensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisner has said he and key members of the Disney board didn't  
see Katzenberg as presidential material. Eisner considered him a 
fine movie executive but didn't think he had the maturity or 
big-picture focus for the more important job. Eisner complained 
that Katzenberg focused on his own agenda and wasn't concerned 
enough about the company as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenberg, in turn, was shocked that he wasn't being considered  
for the post, since he had dutifully served Disney for a decade. In 
parting ways with Disney, Katzenberg says, he made only two 
requests of Eisner: that he get his fat incentive bonus and that 
the separation be amicable. 
</P>
<P>
	Forget it.  
</P>
<P>
	Disney nixed the incentive bonus, because, Disney says,  
Katzenberg was never entitled to it in the first place. But 
Katzenberg testified that at a meeting at his house Eisner 
condescendingly told him, ``If I behaved myself, in a couple of 
weeks he would revisit'' the issue. Eisner was angry the divorce 
proceeding was being played out in the press, and he blamed 
Katzenberg for the leaks. 
</P>
<P>
	In unusually blunt language, Eisner testified: ``If he's going  
to play this media game, this deceptive game, this disingenuous 
game ... I was simply not going to pay his money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This media game, as Eisner saw it, was part of what he called  
Katzenberg's ``dark side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eisner vented much of his anger to Tony Schwartz, the  
collaborator on his autobiography. Schwartz's notes included this 
quotation from Eisner about Katzenberg: ``I think I hate the little 
midget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The remark about the 5-foot-4-inch executive never made it into  
the book. But Eisner was confronted with the notes by Katzenberg's 
lawyer, Bert Fields. Eisner said he probably was joking or 
temporarily angry. Then Eisner issued what many saw as a thinly 
veiled threat to Fields and Katzenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	The line of questioning was ``ill-advised,'' an icy Eisner told  
the lawyer. He further said, the questioning was ``not in your 
client's best interest or mine, but particularly your client's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trial continues next week.

<HEADLINE> Fee Cut for Texas Tobacco Lawyer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEXARKANA, Texas (AP) -- A lawyer whose request for a  
half-billion dollars in legal fees for working on the state's 
tobacco settlement has led to an FBI investigation of Texas' former 
attorney general agreed today to accept only $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyer, Mark Murr of Houston, is a longtime friend and  
former law partner of Dan Morales, who was Texas attorney general 
when the state reached a $17.3 billion settlement with the tobacco 
industry in early 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	When Murr submitted his request for legal fees, other private  
attorneys who worked on the tobacco case for the state said that 
Murr had done little or nothing to achieve the settlement. Some 
said they hadn't even heard of him. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal investigators and Morales' successor as attorney general  
are now looking into whether Morales falsified paperwork to make it 
look as if his friend contributed more than he really did. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, a state arbitration panel decided Murr deserved only  
$260 million. Later, a national arbitration panel recommended he 
get just $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Murr's attorney, Roy Minton, and Texas Attorney  
General John Cornyn announced that Murr would give up the fight for 
the $260 million and accept the $1 million. Cornyn has accused 
Morales of fraudulently trying to help his friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Murr gave up in the face of what we believe was  
overwhelming evidence,'' Cornyn said. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was announced just before a federal judge was to  
hear arguments on whether the three members of the state 
arbitration panel were illegally selected -- they were chosen by 
Murr and Morales. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have not suggested that Morales profited  
personally. And Morales has denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Morales has said Murr provided ``critical'' legal assistance.  
Murr has said he contributed 2,000 hours to craft strategy and 
draft part of the settlement of the state's lawsuit against the 
tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources speaking on condition of anonymity have told The  
Associated Press that the FBI has been comparing computer 
hard-drive data to papers to determine whether Morales backdated 
four contracts and letters to make it appear that Murr was involved 
in the case longer than he really was. 
</P>
<P>
	Morales did not run for re-election and left office in January.  
</P>
<P>
	Texas was one of four states that reached independent deals with  
the tobacco industry. The 46 other states reached a separate $206 
billion settlement last November.

<HEADLINE> Bulls Fall From First To Worst </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Bulls should have known on the very  
first day of practice they were in for a rough year. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't just that Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Dennis  
Rodman were gone. Or that there were so many new people milling 
about the practice facility it looked like a Welcome Wagon 
get-together. 
</P>
<P>
	Nope, the omen came when rookie coach Tim Floyd met his players  
-- and told them to go home because they didn't have enough players 
signed to practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know this much, there were a lot of different situations we  
had to deal with,'' Floyd said. ``All I know is that next year is 
going to look like Palm Beach with three days in between games, 
time to prepare. I'm saying that now and you'll probably remind me 
of that in April of next season, but there are a lot of things 
about next year that I'm looking forward to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like winning a few more games, maybe. The Bulls went 13-37 in  
this lockout-shortened season, the worst record in the Eastern 
Conference and third worst in the NBA. They finished 20 games 
behind Indiana -- the same Pacers team that Chicago beat last year 
in the Eastern finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Their .260 winning percentage was the lowest in franchise  
history, beating out the 1975-76 squad, which finished 24-58 with a 
.293 winning percentage. That team was 15-35 after 50 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Their average of 81.9 points was the lowest scoring average in  
NBA history since the inception of the shot clock. Entering this 
season, the lowest average was 87.4 points in 72 games by the 
Milwaukee Hawks in 1954-55, the season the clock was adopted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew it was going to be tough, I knew we were going to lose  
some games,'' Dickey Simpkins said Thursday after cleaning out his 
locker. ``I didn't know we were going to lose some games by as many 
points as we did. I didn't know we were going to set some records 
like we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That the Bulls were going to be bad this season was a given.  
When Jordan retired in January, management decided it was best to 
gut the team and start over rather than throw a bunch of money at 
Pippen, Rodman, Luc Longley and Steve Kerr for one last go-around. 
</P>
<P>
	That left the Bulls with Toni Kukoc, Ron Harper, a few backups  
and a bunch of anonymous players they picked up in the 
sign-and-trade deals for Pippen, Longley and Kerr. They barely knew 
each other's names, let alone the triangle offense, when the season 
began. With 50 games packed into a three-month span, there was time 
to play and travel and that was about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Forget rest, forget practice, forget anything but marginal  
improvement. And it showed in the box scores. Chicago won its 
second game -- OK, so it was against the Clippers, one of the few 
teams lowlier than the Bulls -- and then lost the next seven. 
</P>
<P>
	There were blowouts, awful, one-sided games throughout the  
season that are better off forgotten. There was a 49-point game 
against Miami, the lowest output since the shot clock, and a 
47-point loss to Orlando in early April, the most lopsided defeated 
in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a hard year,'' said Bill Wennington, one of the few  
veterans left. ``We really didn't have a lot of practice time, 
which made it difficult for us to get in an offensive flow and 
learn this offense because this is an offense of recognition. The 
only way you can get better at it is to run it and go over it in 
practice. We just didn't have that time this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls will get more time next year, but the road won't be  
much easier. Kukoc and Brent Barry are among just a handful of 
players under contract, and most of the free agents who could make 
a difference have already re-signed with their current teams. There 
are some good prospects in the draft, but not a Tim Duncan-like 
player who can come in and make a difference right away. 
</P>
<P>
	Give it time, Floyd said.  
</P>
<P>
	``This was a first step in what I hope will be a championship  
process,'' he said. ``If I didn't feel like that's what I wanted to 
accomplish personally when I came, then I wouldn't have come 
here.''

<HEADLINE> Big Plans for Star Wars Opening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Seth Miller has been preparing his clients for a  
month. Come May 19, he and his staff hope to be in a galaxy far, 
far away, soaking in the return of Star Wars. 
</P>
<P>
	Call 'em geeks. Call 'em hip. Just don't look for many Star Wars  
buffs at work on The Big Day, the Wednesday release of the latest 
episode in the galactic epic. 
</P>
<P>
	They're closing down offices, renting out theaters, taking weeks  
of vacation to stand in line for tickets. By one estimate, more 
than 2 million workers could skip work for the opening. An informal 
national holiday is brewing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing's that important that we can't skip work for the  
day,'' said Miller, president of Boston-based Miller Systems, an 
Internet consulting company with a staff of seven. ``As soon as the 
date was announced for the movie, I decided that had to be a 
company holiday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Brandon Herman, May is a self-declared holiday. He told his  
parents that he won't be working at his family's video production 
company most of the month due to the movie -- the first release of a 
Star Wars film since 1983. Tickets go on sale May 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've waited 16 years,'' he said earnestly, standing his ground  
in the ticket line outside a New York cinema as fellow fans around 
him dueled with light-sabers. ``I can't wait any longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once in a while, news, sports or scandals intrude on work life.  
Before the World Series began night games in 1971, fans kept radios 
on at work during games. O.J. Simpson's murder trial distracted 
workers for months; the verdict stopped work nationwide in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``They tend to be events that feel close to home, that feel  
apocalyptic in nature, overwhelming,'' said Talmadge Wright, an 
associate professor of sociology at Loyola University in Chicago 
and a follower of pop culture. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks partly to a service economy that venerates creativity,  
the Star Wars lexicon is already part of many workplaces' culture, 
particularly in high-tech fields. ``May the Force be with you!'', 
co-workers say. ``Try not. Do... or do not. There is no try.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Especially for Baby Boomers, who've grown up with the Jedi and  
now call the shots in many offices, it's a no-brainer to decide to 
shut down the company for the long-awaited movie. 
</P>
<P>
	Ric Edelman, head of Edelman Financial Services in Fairfax, Va.,  
is having the three earlier Star Wars films shown at his firm -- 
twice -- having discovered 7 percent of his 90 employees hadn't seen 
any. He also hopes to take his entire staff to see the new film. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those of us who've seen them find it hard to believe there's  
anybody in America who hasn't,'' roars Edelman. 
</P>
<P>
	Lesley Roberts, Edelman's human resources director and one of  
the 7 percent, is taking her education good-naturedly. She 
describes the excitement as ``interesting.'' Star Wars talk has 
``become more a part of my daily routine,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheree Franklin also finds it hard to concentrate on her work  
these days -- but she's ecstatic. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Franklin, a human resources director who watches the trilogy  
at least twice a month, has been taking a daily break for months to 
look at Web sites devoted to the movie. During opening week, she 
and other employees at GoldMine Software of Pacific Palisades, 
Calif., will see the movie when their boss rents a theater. 
</P>
<P>
	When Wil Schroter heard that the movie was coming, he quickly  
rented a 500-seat theater in Columbus, Ohio, for employees at his 
Internet consulting firm, NGDA Interactive Communications, and 
their guests. But their enthusiasm surprised even Schroter, a 
die-hard fan. 
</P>
<P>
	When he announced his coup, he got requests for 100 tickets in  
10 minutes -- the biggest response he'd ever gotten to a company 
e-mail. To complete the May 21 festivities, he's throwing a 
pre-screening office party and encouraging the staff to work in 
costume that day. 
</P>
<P>
	Office costumes, playing hooky? Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas  
Inc., an employment agency, estimates 2.2 million employees could 
skip work to see the movie on opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	Some might ask if all the hoopla won't hurt productivity. But  
economist Sung Won Sohn, of Wells Fargo in Minneapolis, says any 
dip in labor will be offset by a boost in spending, be it on 
tickets, toys or popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, you won't catch him taking the day off or standing in  
line to see the movie. He's a Star Wars fan but says he'll wait a 
week or two. 
</P>
<P>
	``My time is more valuable,'' he chuckled.

<HEADLINE>  Scots Are Voting for Own Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) -- Scots voted today for their first  
separate Parliament in three centuries, torn between enthusiasm and 
trepidation about the prospects of having independence-seeking 
nationalists as their main opposition party. 
</P>
<P>
	The three million Welsh also voted for a separate, but less  
powerful assembly under the constitutional shake-up that Prime 
Minister Tony Blair's two-year-old government sees as 
decentralizing the United Kingdom, not breaking it up. 
</P>
<P>
	Northern Ireland has already elected an assembly.  
</P>
<P>
	For 25 million English voters, nothing has changed. Today was  
simply a polling day for local authorities. The balloting is a test 
of Blair's record popularity ratings, although fewer than 
one-in-four eligible Britons are likely to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	In Edinburgh, retiree David Barber was among the first to turn  
out in drizzling rain at an elementary school in the Marchmont 
district. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm voting tactically. I don't want the Scottish National  
Party to get anywhere near Parliament,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bedraggled posters of Britain's governing Labor Party, and the  
black thistle of the Scottish National Party flapped on street 
corners as widespread rain poured down from the remote Orkney 
Islands in the north to the big cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won't get independence this time, but we are on our way,''  
said Karen Morgan, 33, after voting nationalist in Edinburgh's 
inner-city South Side district. 
</P>
<P>
	With Labor and the nationalists battling for control of the  
129-member Parliament, opinion polls at the end of a five-week 
campaign indicated that Labor will win the largest bloc of seats 
but fall short of overall control. 
</P>
<P>
	The nationalists were set for transformation from a fringe party  
in the House of Commons in London to the official opposition in 
Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the very least we should make sure that this Parliament is  
controlled from Scotland, not by Labor in London,'' SNP leader Alex 
Salmond declared late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Blair's Scottish Secretary, Donald Dewar, who is almost sure to  
become Scotland's new leader, argues that England and Scotland both 
benefit from the 300-year union. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea that we go in for the destruction and dismantling of  
all our common endeavors ... I just don't think it makes sense,'' 
added Dewar, a 60-year-old Glasgow lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Parliament will control a swath of domestic affairs,  
including health, education, transport and sport, and -- unlike the 
60-member Welsh assembly in Cardiff -- have powers to legislate and 
raise taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The nationalists, neck-and-neck with Labor 18 months ago, accuse  
the anti-independence Scottish press and the government of playing 
on fears that an independent Scotland would quickly fall billions 
into debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent polls put the nationalists on 30 percent support, some 12  
points behind Labor, with the rest of decided voters split between 
the minority parties, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	But some one-fourth of voters were apparently undecided.  
</P>
<P>
	Blair's main problem in the local elections in England is  
getting the vote out. The Scots and Welsh are more likely to vote 
because the local polls coincide with the assembly votes. 
</P>
<P>
	At stake are seats on 362 local councils in England, Wales and  
Scotland. The Conservative Party, the battered, main opposition in 
the Commons, was expected by some analysts to gain around 1,000 of 
those 13,000 seats. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no elections in London this year.

the minority parties, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	But some one-fourth of voters were apparently undecided.  
</P>
<P>
	Blair's main problem in the local elections in England is  
getting the vote out. The Scots and Welsh are more likely to vote 
because the local polls coincide with the assembly votes. 
</P>
<P>
	At stake are seats on 362 local councils in England, Wales and  
Scotland. The Conservative Party, the battered, main opposition in 
the Commons, was expected by some analysts to gain around 1,000 of 
those 13,000 seats. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no elections in London this year.

<HEADLINE> NBC Gives Top Team NBA West Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The balance in the NBA has shifted and it is evident with NBC's  
decision to send its top announcing team west for the first time 
since Larry Bird and Magic Johnson entered the league. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's top draw for the past decade has been Michael Jordan and  
the Bulls. But now, with the marquee teams coming from west of the 
Mississippi, the network has decided to send Bob Costas and Doug 
Collins to cover the Lakers in the first round -- after a quick stop 
in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the Bulls, the Detroit Pistons were the attraction just  
prior to NBC obtaining the NBA rights in 1990. The combination of 
the Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers got the nod over the 
Lakers throughout the '80's. 
</P>
<P>
	With the NBA playoff picture a mess until the final night of the  
regular season Wednesday, NBC was scrambling well into Thursday 
morning to determine where their broadcasters were headed for a 
pair of weekend tripleheaders. 
</P>
<P>
	About the only sure thing over the past few weeks was that the  
No. 1 team of Costas and Collins would be in Los Angeles at some 
point during the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	It's no surprise they'll call the Lakers-Rockets game Sunday at  
5:30 p.m. EDT after working the Knicks-Heat telecast Saturday -- not 
after working an overwhelming 10 Lakers games this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The real shock is that neither Dick Stockton, in his tenure as  
the top play-by-play man at CBS, nor Marv Albert, who held the same 
position for NBC until last year when Costas took over, ever called 
a first-round Western Conference game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never started with the Western Conference while I was at  
CBS,'' said Turner's Stockton, who was CBS' top guy from 1982-90. 
``But I think they are doing that because the Lakers are a big draw 
-- even though you don't know how long they'll last.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC executive producer Tom Roy had little choice but to place  
Costas and Collins with Los Angeles after investing so much in the 
team this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of compelling stories in the west this season  
and viewer interest has shown that, based on ratings, Western 
Conference teams are more likable,'' Roy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the late Sunday game traditionally earns the highest  
ratings, and the network usually has its top tandem working the 
highest-rated game of the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, who has been extremely critical of the Lakers this  
season, thinks the network will get more than one series out of the 
team in which they have invested so much. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody had a more up-close-and-personal view of what went on  
with LA, but they are playing better than they have in a long 
time,'' Collins said. ``They played with more passion and emotion 
last week against Portland and if they play well, they can still 
beat anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although NBA ratings have been solid despite the lockout,  
Collins knows the true test comes now -- when even the most casual 
fans would tune in to watch Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the league is prepared for the ratings to be down and  
they are hoping to bounce back next year,'' he said. ``But a lot 
depends on who gets there. If you have Utah or San Antonio, I think 
you'll have pretty good ratings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Notice how Collins omitted the Lakers. And he knows them better  
than just about anyone. 
</P>
<P>

	 *LEANING TOWARDS TWO:* As John Elway waits, so does ABC.  
</P>
<P>
	Elway has been contacted by ABC about becoming the third member  
of the ``Monday Night Football'' team and is mulling it over. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC will likely stick with Al Michaels and Boomer Esiason if  
Elway declines. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's safe to assume that at this point we are going to stay  
with two people in the booth,'' said ABC spokesman Mark Mandel. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN analyst Paul Maguire, rumored to be a candidate for the  
third spot with ABC, enjoys doing Sunday night games but said it 
would be tough to turn down ``MNF.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Why wouldn't anyone want it?,'' Maguire said. ``But it hasn't  
been presented to me and I don't think it will be.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MOLLING AROUND:* Paul Molitor is a rookie again. But now he is  
already talking retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Molitor broadcasts Twins games for Fox Sports Net, and also was  
a baserunning-hitting instructor for Minnesota this past spring 
training. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal was not necessarily to have a future in broadcasting,  
but was to stay current on the players in an interim year,'' said 
the Minnesota native. ``Ideally, I'd like to take on a full-time 
baseball position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Molitor is just waiting to see if the future of the Twins is in  
the Twin Cities. If they remain, he'll almost certainly be a 
batting coach somewhere in the organization. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TUBE BITS:* The Kentucky Derby posted a 6.3 national rating, up  
three percent from last year. ... NBC has NBA tripleheaders 
Saturday and Sunday, beginning at 12:30 p.m. ... ESPN baseball 
analyst Ray Knight, coaching his 12-year-old daughter's softball 
team, was charged with disorderly conduct last week after striking 
a spectator during an argument. ... CNN/SI's Trev Alberts had his 
NFL career cut short after three seasons due to three major 
injuries. He was the college football studio analyst for the past 
two seasons, and will see double-duty this year after replacing 
James Lofton on the NFL show. He turned down offers from ABC, ESPN 
and CBS ... ESPN's NHL playoff ratings are up 11 percent as are 
ESPN2's, but Fox's tumbled 37 percent.

<HEADLINE> Skier Uses Cell Phone in Avalanche </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALTA, Utah (AP) -- A skier buried chest-high in an avalanche  
found his cell phone pushed against his face in a jacket pocket and 
managed to dial for help. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Ron Clark, a Pleasant Grove surgeon, his two sons and 12  
other skiers and snowboarders were swept up by a slide that roared 
down Lone Peak Ridge on Wednesday. In the end, Clark's eldest son, 
12-year-old Craig, broke loose and was able to free his father and 
11-year-old brother before rescuers arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	The slide at the Alta Ski Resort in Little Cottonwood Canyon, 18  
miles southeast of Salt Lake City, ripped down a lower slope for 
about 1,000 yards, snapping thick trees on the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a two-second warning and we were completely unprepared  
for it,'' Clark said. ``The slide just took us forward.'' He said 
his jacket was twisted over his head by the force of the slide, 
placing his cell phone in a pocket in front of his face. 
</P>
<P>
	When they arrived, rescuers used dogs, beacons and probes to  
make sure no one else remained buried. About three hours after the 
slide, authorities called off the search, saying everyone was 
accounted for. No one was seriously hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``These folks are extremely lucky,'' said Sgt. Lane Larkin of  
the Salt Lake County sheriff's department. 
</P>
<P>
	The ski area closed weeks ago, so enthusiasts must climb the  
mountain instead of using lifts. Ski patrol workers are also sparse 
as the season winds down, leaving back country skiers on their own, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Avalanche danger was high on Wednesday, with warming  
temperatures and 40 inches of snow in the area since Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Claims Rise by 6,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans filing applications  
for unemployment benefits rose slightly last week after two 
consecutive weekly declines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported today that 301,000 people filed  
for jobless benefits, an increase of 6,000 from the previous week 
and about in line with economists' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The benefit applications had dipped below the 300,000 level the  
previous week to 295,000. From late January through mid-March, the 
weekly applications number remained below 300,000 for a nine week 
stretch, the longest period since 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is scheduled to issue the unemployment report for  
April on Friday and many economists believe it will remain at a 
29-year low of 4.2 percent, demonstrating that America's sparkling 
economy is continuing to power ahead despite overseas financial 
turmoil that has pushed one-third of the world into recession. 
</P>
<P>
	While more than 300,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost in the  
past year, reflecting lost export markets for American companies, 
the continued low unemployment has kept consumers on a buying 
spree. For the first three months of this year, the overall economy 
grew at a robust annual rate of 4.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The good combination of low unemployment and rapid growth is  
occuring in an environment with little inflation, which has stayed 
under control despite the tight labor markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Most analysts believe the Federal Reserve, which next meets to  
set interest rates on May 20, will be content to leave rates 
unchanged and let the good times keep rolling along. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Fed said that its latest nationwide survey of  
economic conditions found that U.S. manufacturers are bouncing back 
from Asian currency crisis. The Fed said the improvement in 
manufacturing was broad-based -- ranging from increased demand for 
medical and automotive equipment reported by the Fed's Boston 
branch to solid orders for computers and telecommunications 
equipment reported by the San Francisco Fed. 
</P>
<P>
	The jobless claims report today showed that a four-week moving  
average for claims was essentially unchanged at 307,000, compared 
to 307,500 the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	In state-by-state data which lags the national figures by one  
week, the Labor Department said 35 states and territories had 
decreases in claims for the week ending April 24 and 17 had 
declines with one reporting no change. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest declines were reported by New York, down 8,563;  
California, down 4,117 because of fewer layoffs in agriculture; 
North Carolina, where claims fell by 2,704 because of fewer layoffs 
in the apparel industry and Ohio, where claims fell by 2,315. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest increase in unemployment claims was in  
Massachusetts, a rise of 4,639, reflecting increased layoffs in 
service industries; Rhode Island, an increase of 1,161 because of 
higher layoffs in service industries and manufacturing and 
Illinois, with an increase of 1,099 because increased layoffs in 
trade, service industries and manufacturing.

<HEADLINE> Celtics Need Defense, Conditioning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Red Auerbach shuffled into the winning locker room  
and greeted the smiling coach, who planted a kiss on the bald head 
of the Celtics' 81-year-old patriarch. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe next year that room will belong to Boston, who Auerbach  
coached to nine NBA titles. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday night, the winners were the Charlotte Hornets, who  
had just beaten Boston 133-129 in double overtime in the teams' 
season finale. And the coach, Paul Silas, was a reminder of how far 
the Celtics have dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	Silas played on two of their 16 championship teams in his four  
years with the club from 1972 through 1976. In the last six years, 
the Celtics haven't had a single winning record and reached the 
playoffs just once. 
</P>
<P>
	They have outstanding offensive talent, led by Antoine Walker,  
Ron Mercer and Paul Pierce, but the lack of practice in the 
shortened season may have hurt a young team like Boston more than 
experienced clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year all we did was give out the exam. Here's what we're  
playing. Here's how we have to play it. We never taught class,'' 
coach Rick Pitino said. ``Now, basically, we have the opportunity 
to do what we enjoy the most and that's teach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In their second season under Pitino, the Celtics dropped from a  
36-46 record to 19-31. In his previous four coaching jobs -- with 
Boston University, Providence College, the New York Knicks and the 
University of Kentucky -- Pitino's teams improved their records in 
his second year. 
</P>
<P>
	His current players are confident that will happen next season  
if they improve their conditioning and defense and avoid health 
problems that plagued them this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now the chemistry is coming along,'' Mercer said. ``We  
just need some defense. After that, if we stay healthy, we can be a 
very good team. There's not too much that you really have to 
change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Celtics got a sample of what it takes to be successful in  
their last 18 games. They finished at 9-9 after starting at 10-22. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody was playing unselfish,'' Mercer said. ``It didn't  
really matter who scored. Everybody went out (and) we passed the 
ball very well. ... Too bad we couldn't do that the whole year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We made strides the last three or four weeks,'' Walker said.  
``We didn't pack it in and that showed a lot of heart by 
everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The surge coincided with a hamstring injury that forced point  
guard Kenny Anderson to sit out the last 15 games. Boston was 7-8 
with Dana Barros filling his spot after going 12-23 before the 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dana had a wonderful year,'' Pitino said.  
</P>
<P>
	So did Pierce, who was determined to show that nine teams made a  
mistake in allowing the Celtics to draft him with the 10th pick. He 
was second among NBA rookies with 16.5 points and 6.4 rebounds per 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to go in and establish myself right away,'' he said.  
``I think I was able to do that. Still, the goals that I wanted I 
wasn't able to achieve, which is going to the playoffs. But we have 
a nice young corps of guys and I think we're going to have a great 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Injuries to Walker, who missed eight games with a sprained ankle  
before playing the last two, and Anderson gave Pitino a chance to 
experiment. He saw the stabilizing presence of Barros, a 10-year 
veteran, and a sign of inside strength when Vitaly Potapenko and 
Tony Battie played together in the frontcourt. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pitino preaches defense first and that was lacking.  
</P>
<P>
	``If our conditioning gets better your defense gets better,'' he  
said. ``This year, because of our average conditioning, we couldn't 
play great defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also thinks Walker, the team captain, can expand his game.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's always going to score a lot of points,'' Pitino said.  
``With the way he can pass the ball, his intelligence on the court, 
if he can average six or seven assists a game, we're going to be 
really tough shooting a high percentage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Celtics made just 43.6 percent of their field goal attempts  
and 69.2 percent of their free throws. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercer, one of their top outside shooters, could be gone before  
next season. He has one year left on his contract and negotiations 
for an extension are expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be a Celtic for life,'' he said, while suggesting  
that business considerations may interfere with that goal. 
</P>
<P>
	But Walker, armed with a long-term contract, will be back. And  
if Mercer stays, the Celtics have a solid young nucleus that 
includes Pierce, Battie and Potapenko along with veterans Barros 
and Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe having a little failure may have woken us up a little  
bit and gotten us in the right path in what we need to do,'' Walker 
said. ``Adversity taught us that defense counts first and offense 
second. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody put us on this big pedestal, that we're supposed to  
be the Utah Jazz,'' he added, without saying who made that 
comparison. ``We're a young team. It's going to take some time to 
build this.''

<HEADLINE> Jury Gets Jenny Jones Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Jurors spent Thursday weighing the  
evidence in the trial of a lawsuit against ``The Jenny Jones Show'' 
over the death of a gay guest who revealed a crush on another man. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury deliberated for almost seven hours and was scheduled to  
reconvene Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, attorney Geoffrey Fieger asked the jury to find  
the show and its corporate owner, Warner Bros., liable for Scott 
Amedure's death and award his family $71.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Amedure, 32, died in 1995, three days after revealing his crush  
on Jonathan Schmitz during a taping of the show. Amedure's family 
contends a mentally ill Schmitz was lured onto the show believing 
he would meet a woman, and was humiliated into murder when his 
secret admirer turned out to be Amedure. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Warner Bros. said Schmitz was solely responsible and  
that he might have killed Amedure because the two had a sexual 
encounter. Fieger denied that allegation. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz was found guilty of murder in 1996, but his conviction  
was thrown out on appeal. His retrial is set for Aug. 19.

<HEADLINE> Mortgage Rise Above 7 Percent / National Mortgage Survey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages  
have risen above the 7.0 percent mark for the second time this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The average this week was 7.02 percent, up from 6.93 percent the

</P>
<P>
	So far this year, rates have fluctated between 6.74 percent at  
the end of January and 7.11 percent in mid-March. Before March, 
when rates held above 7.0 percent for three weeks, rates had held 
below that mark since last June.

<P>
	Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing,  
averaged 6.61 percent this week, up from 6.55 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an  
average initial rate of 5.68 percent, up from 5.63 the week before. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which  
averaged at or just over 1 percent of the loan amount for all three

<HEADLINE> Mourning, Heat Seek Breakthrough  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The other matchups -- Pat Riley vs. Jeff Van Gundy,  
P.J. Brown vs. Charlie Ward -- are mere subplots. The playoff series 
between the Miami Heat and New York Knicks boils down to Alonzo 
Mourning vs. his multiple demons. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourning must figure a way to conquer them all: playoff  
pressure, fourth-quarter fadeouts, a short fuse and the Knicks 
themselves. Game 1 will be Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``All players go through a period where there's a wall, and  
you've got to break through it and get over the top,'' Riley said 
Thursday. ``It's a rite of passage. The playoffs always tell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mourning is coming off the best season of his seven-year career.  
He averaged 20 points and 11 rebounds per game, led the NBA in 
blocked shots and won endorsements from teammates and opponents as 
the league's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
	But elimination of the Heat by the hated Knicks would reinforce  
Mourning's reputation for folding under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Zo will be ready for whatever they throw at him,''  
teammate Brown said. ``It's definitely a chance to add icing on the 
cake to the great year he's had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mourning has become rattled in each of the three playoff series  
the Heat have lost under Riley. First it was the Chicago Bulls' 
Dennis Rodman that got under Mourning's skin. Last season the 
Knicks' Larry Johnson lured Mourning into a Game 4 slugfest and 
suspension from the deciding Game 5, which Miami lost. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite this year's achievements, Mourning couldn't shake a  
tendency to disappear late in close games. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time the Knicks played in Miami, Mourning had 27 points  
through three quarters, then had two points and no rebounds in the 
fourth quarter. The Knicks rallied from a 20-point deficit to win, 
and their locker room later filled with laughter when Johnson 
staggered across the shower floor in an impersonation of Mourning 
wilting under the pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Mourning snapped at a reporter who mentioned  
Johnson's name. Mourning then said he doesn't know whether the 
Knicks will try to get physical with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't care,'' he said. ``It's not going to be a  
factor at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a physical series, but not dirty,'' Johnson  
said. ``Both teams are ready for war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mourning said the only thing that matters to Miami is the goal  
of reaching the NBA Finals for the first time. With Michael Jordan 
retired and no dominant team in the league, there's a void at the 
top. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've learned, just like the Bulls had to learn,'' Mourning  
said. ``They lost against good teams. They took a lot of falls. I 
watched it when I was in junior high school. I saw Michael on the 
bench crying. I remember those moments against Detroit, getting 
their butts kicked. We took the same hits he took.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most painful hit came last year against the Knicks, but  
bitter feelings between the two teams date to 1995, when Riley left 
New York amid considerable acrimony. A brawl started by Brown and 
Ward proved pivotal in the 1997 playoff series, won by Miami. After 
the Knicks eliminated the Heat last year, Riley and Knicks coach 
Van Gundy were summoned to the NBA commissioner's office and 
scolded for their verbal feuding. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley said he expect this year's series to be physical but not  
so personal as in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would think that behavior would be over,'' he said. ``There  
can't be any false bravado or antics or anything on a personal 
agenda. We've been through that scene. We're all tired of it. I 
think that's a thing of the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Riley said, Mourning will likely be targeted by the  
Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a propensity to come hard at Zo and foul him hard,''  
Riley said. ``That's a game plan. It's on everybody's blackboard 
prior to the game: When Zo goes to the basket, foul him. He's dealt 
with it.''

<P>
	Doubts remain as to whether Mourning can become a championship  
center, but his value to the Heat is unquestioned. When he was 
sidelined last week with an eye injury, Miami lost consecutive 
games to a pair of lottery teams, Boston and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing they have this year is they've got the MVP of the  
league,'' Van Gundy said. ``He's been by far the most dominant 
player in the league, and we're going to have to combat that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston Celtics legend Bill Russell recently called Mourning the  
best active center in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``He works so hard and he's so effective for his team,'' Russell  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourning, who has three seasons left on a seven-year, $105  
million contract, is the best-paid athlete in South Florida. 
Although he has never enjoyed the popularity of Dan Marino, or even 
Craig Counsell, fans chanted ``M-V-P, M-V-P'' during the final home 
game of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mourning knows how cheers can quickly change to jeers. At  
the age of 29, he begins a postseason that could define his career.

<HEADLINE> Tougher Rules for NY Fight Judge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Strict background checks, including financial  
disclosures, of title fight judges in New York are now required. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't the boxers that got kayoed, it was the fans,'' Gov.  
George Pataki said of the controversial draw between Lennox Lewis 
and Evander Holyfield that spurred the reforms announced Wednesday 
by Pataki and Attorney General Eliot Spitzer. ``My personal opinion 
is that the decision was indefensible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Sadly, today the public sees boxing's credibility on par with  
that of professional wrestling,'' Spitzer said. ``In short, the 
sweet science has turned sour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Manhattan grand jury is looking into the Lewis-Holyfield  
decision. Most observers felt Lewis won the match for the 
undisputed heavyweight title March 13 at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a lucrative rematch is in the works for Nov. 6 or  
Nov. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd like it to take place in New York state,'' Pataki said.  
``If it does, it's going to be under these new rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pursuing the rematch,'' said Ken Munoz, executive vice  
president of the Garden. ``Frankly, it's somewhat difficult. 
(Promoter Don) King has a lot of offers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Las Vegas is being prominently as the site of a rematch.  
</P>
<P>
	Effective immediately, judges must be sanctioned by the state,  
and judges who reside, or are licensed, in other jurisdictions must 
submit a sworn application for a license and make certain 
disclosures. They include a credit check, revealing pending 
litigations such as bankruptcy or criminal proceedings and any 
financial ties with either boxer, promoter, the venue or television 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile in Washington, a Senate committee approved Wednesday a  
bill aimed at reforming the business side of boxing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Muhammad Ali Reform Act now goes before the full Senate,  
which passed a virtually identical version last year by voice vote. 
The House, however, did not take up the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ali Act would protect boxers from exploitation from  
promoters and managers by requiring specific guidelines for 
contracts and disclosure of the complicated financial dealings 
surrounding big fights. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki directed the New York State Athletic Commission, chaired  
by Mel Southard, to work with federal legislators to get the Ali 
Act passed and signed in law. 
</P>
<P>
	Also to be implemented immediately by the New York Commission  
are the way championship fight judges are selected, and tougher 
standards for becoming a judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Each sanctioning body with an interest in a title fight must  
submit a list of three candidates for judge, instead of one, and 
the commission will select one from each set of candidates. It can 
reject the nominations and select a judge without further 
nomination. If only two sanctioning bodies are involved, the 
commission will select at least one independent judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Judges will need to pass written and oral examinations and  
attend a mandatory annual seminar. 
</P>
<P>
	The following reforms for title fights also will be recommended  
to the Association of Boxing Commissioners at its annual meeting in 
July at Baltimore: 
</P>
<P>
	-- A referee would be required to judge the fight, and his card  
would be considered if the decision is a draw. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Each of the three judges' scorecards would be compared on a  
round-by-round basis, and after each round a consensus would be 
reached by rejecting the decision of the judge in the minority. 
</P>
<P>
	-- And independent poll of boxing writers, broadcasters and  
historian would rank fighters.

<HEADLINE> Energy Boss Defends Administration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson acknowledged  
massive security breaches at nuclear weapons labs Thursday but said 
in an interview that criticism is ``starting to become a blame 
game'' that could hurt the labs and the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said an interview with The Associated Press that  
while he could not guarantee there would be no future security 
lapses at the government research labs, he is convinced the kind of 
failure now under investigation at the Los Alamos lab ``cannot 
occur with the measures we have taken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department recently ordered new procedures to guard  
against transfer of material from classified to unclassified 
computers, created additional ``firewalls'' to reduce hacker 
attacks on its computer systems and began more extensive monitoring 
of e-mail. In April the labs' computer systems were shut down for 
two weeks to integrate the new security measures. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't admit perfection has been achieved, but I can be  
confident to say we've taken bold, dramatic steps to greatly 
improve the prospects that there would not be any future security 
lapses,'' said Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 45-minute discussion in his office at the Energy  
Department, Richardson defended the administration's response to 
security concerns and espionage at the weapons labs and said: 
</P>
<P>
	--The security breaches at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in  
New Mexico, including the transfer of massive amounts of weapons 
computer codes to an unsecure desktop computer was ``an 
unacceptable, intolerable security breach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--That he was not ``personally aware of any other serious''  
security violations like the one under investigation at Los Alamos 
at any of the labs. 
</P>
<P>
	--There is no evidence that China or any other country obtained  
any of the computer design and performance codes that had been 
moved from the secure computer system, but that one should ``assume 
the worst' and take ``draconian measures'' to avoid a repeat 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said that both Republican and Democratic  
administrations have made missteps when it comes to security at the 
federal weapons research labs including Los Alamos in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's plenty of blame to share,'' said Richardson.  
</P>
<P>
	``We should concentrate on reforming the (security) system  
rather than destroying it for political gain,'' said Richardson. 
``It's starting to become a political issue. ... It is taking on a 
political life of its own that's only going to hurt the labs and 
the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Some are trying to say we reacted much too slowly on cyber  
security. I reject that,'' said Richardson. He said he did not want 
to dwell ``on what happened in the past'' and ``concentrate on what 
we've done to fix the problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least 10 congressional committees are looking into how the  
Clinton administration responded to allegations of lax security at 
weapons labs and the discovery in 1996 of a major theft of secrets 
by China at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. The theft took 
place in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	A Taiwan-born scientist at Los Alamos was fired March 8 after  
being the prime target of an FBI espionage investigation since 
1996. The scientist, Wen Ho Lee, has not been charged with a crime 
and has denied any espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee remains under investigation not only in connection with the  
1980s thefts, but also because investigators found he had allegedly 
transferred hundreds of top-secret computer files of warhead design 
and performance codes from a secure computer system to his unsecure 
desktop computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, some Republican lawmakers compared the Los  
Alamos case to the Julius and Ethel Rosenberg spy case in the 1950s 
and the more recent spy saga involving CIA agent Aldrich Ames. 
Referring to the possible security damage at Los Alamos, Sen. Don 
Nickles, R-Okla., suggested it might be the most damaging case of 
espionage in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's an exaggeration,'' said Richardson. ``The scope, the  
extent of the theft has not been determined. The breach was 
serious,'' he continued. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, said Richardson ``there's no evidence that China or  
anybody else got any of these (computer codes). Before we start 
panicking, we need more facts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said he was concerned that several moves underway in  
Congress to restrict or even ban foreign scientific exchanges at 
labs or to have the FBI take over lab security are unnecessary and 
an overreaction.

<HEADLINE> Huge African Anti-AIDS Effort Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- In the largest single  
corporate commitment to fight AIDS, Bristol-Myers Squibb is 
donating $100 million over five years to speed research and train 
doctors to fight the disease in Africa, the continent hardest hit 
by the epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
	The move Thursday by the world's fifth-largest drug company  
comes amid criticism from government leaders that drugmakers charge 
too much for their AIDS drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will have a tremendous impact,'' said Cornelius Baker,  
executive director of the National Association of People With AIDS, 
based in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol officials said the donation was not in response to  
criticism on drug prices. Rather, company executives said they felt 
a moral obligation. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Hayden, Bristol's president of worldwide medicines, said the  
company, which had $18.3 billion in sales last year, will still 
consider selling AIDS drugs at steep discounts in countries around 
the world. But, he said, no plans are imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol officials said they considered making a massive drug  
donation, but realized drugs alone would do little to stem the 
epidemic. ``That would be benefit for some time but it would not 
change the course of the disease,'' said Barry Scott, vice 
president of Bristol's international division. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to New York-based Bristol, U.N. Secretary-General  
Kofi Annan lauded the effort, saying such partnerships between the 
public and private sectors are ``critical'' in controlling the 
epidemic which has killed 11.5 million people in sub-Saharan Africa 
-- 83 percent of all AIDS deaths worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The program would:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Finance outside research into how best to fight AIDS in five  
southern African countries -- South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, 
Swaziland and Lesotho -- where the epidemic has infected as many as 
one in four people and cut life expectancy by one-quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The research would test various combinations of drugs on an  
estimated 20,000 people over five years. The trials would also test 
other therapies, such as adjusting nutrition to find the most 
effective -- and affordable -- way to fight AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Finance fellowships for African doctors to study at programs  
administered by the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, and 
award fellowships for American physicians to work in the five 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The program would be directed by representatives from  
governments; UNAIDS, a UN advocacy group for fighting AIDS; and 
major medical facilities, including the Harvard AIDS Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	``Working together we can reverse the tide of death,'' Kenneth  
Weg, vice chairman of Bristol, said at a news conference in 
Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Piot, executive director of UNAIDS, challenged other  
corporations to join the initiative, which is part of an expanded 
effort by the corporate world to confront the AIDS epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key thing is to bring in new partners,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative announced  
it had received a $25 million donation from Microsoft Corp. 
chairman Bill Gates. 
</P>
<P>
	Glaxo Wellcome, which produces AZT, recently offered to supply  
the South African government with the anti-AIDS drug at one-third 
of its market price. The government rejected the offer, saying the 
medication still would be too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	In Africa, where few can afford the medicines that are saving  
the lives of AIDS victims in developed countries, the cost of 
pharmaceuticals is a touchy issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the office of Thabo Mbeki, South Africa's deputy  
president, accused drug companies of charging ``exorbitant'' prices 
for anti-AIDS drugs. American officials, for their part, are angry 
that South Africa advocates the use of cheaper generic drugs, 
allegedly violating copyright laws and depriving companies that 
developed the drugs of profits.

<HEADLINE> Eddie Jones Has Hand Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Charlotte Hornets guard Eddie Jones  
underwent surgery today to repair injuries he suffered when his 
hand hit the rim during an attempted shot block last month. 
</P>
<P>
	A surgeon repaired a flexor tendon, an artery and a nerve in  
Jones' right hand, the team said in a statement. The procedure was 
performed by Dr. Alan Ward at Carolinas Medical Center in 
Charlotte, the Hornets said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' fingers will be in a splint for six weeks and he'll  
undergo an additional six weeks of rehabilitation. He is expected 
to be ready for training camp next season. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury occurred in the fourth quarter of an April 19 game at  
New Jersey. Jones missed the next three games. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones played 41 minutes and scored 21 points Wednesday in  
Charlotte's season finale at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones came to Charlotte from the Los Angeles Lakers in a trade  
that also included center Elden Campbell in exchange for Glen Rice.

<HEADLINE> State Authorities' Wiretapping Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of wiretaps authorized by state  
courts rose by 24 percent last year, while the number of federally 
authorized wiretaps held steady, the government reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	State courts authorized 763 wiretaps, compared with 617 the  
previous year, according to figures released by the Administrative 
Office of the U.S. Courts. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal courts authorized 566 such surveillance actions, about  
even with the 569 authorized in 1997. That adds up to 1,329 
wiretaps authorized by federal and state courts in 1998, an 
increase from 1,186 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	A decade earlier, in 1988, there were 738 total wiretaps  
authorized, including 293 permitted by federal courts and 445 by 
state courts. 
</P>
<P>
	Buggings in New York made up almost half of the state-authorized  
wiretaps, with 373. New Jersey was next with 84, Pennsylvania 
followed with 68, California had 52 and Florida had 44. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventy-two percent of all wiretaps were aimed at catching  
narcotics offenders, while 12 percent were aimed at racketeering 
and 7 percent at gambling. New York City's Special Narcotics Bureau 
got authorization for 186 drug-related buggings. 
</P>
<P>
	Telephone wiretaps made up 40 percent of all devices installed,  
while 46 percent were electronic wiretaps of digital display 
pagers, voice pagers, cellular phones and e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-two states, the District of Columbia, the Virgin Islands  
and the federal government have laws allowing courts to permit some 
form of bugging, and last year 25 states reported use of such 
surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
	The average length of an initial wiretap was 28 days, and the  
average length of an authorized extension was 27 days. Courts 
approved 1,164 extensions of existing wiretaps last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said 3,450 people were arrested as a result of  
wiretaps that ended in 1998, and 26 percent of them were convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal and state judges are required to report to the  
Administrative Office all applications for wiretap authorizations, 
and prosecutors must report when a wiretap is ended.

<HEADLINE> Fewer criminals paying restitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The percentage of criminals being ordered to  
pay restitution has dropped despite the 1996 passage of a law 
requiring restitution in certain federal cases, congressional 
auditors said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's counterintuitive. It's puzzling,'' Richard Stana, the  
General Accounting Office's associate director for administration 
of justice issues, told a House subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first seven months of the 1997 fiscal year -- before the  
law took effect at the end of April -- 26 percent of federal 
offenders were ordered to pay restitution, the GAO found. For the 
rest of that fiscal year, ending Sept. 30, only 12 percent of the 
offenders got such orders. 
</P>
<P>
	For robbers, the likelihood of being ordered to pay restitution  
increased by almost half, but it decreased by almost half for 
larceny offenders, and decreased slightly for those convicted of 
fraud, Stana told the House Judiciary Committee's crime panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, a convict's chances of getting slapped with a fine  
or a restitution order varied widely depending on which judicial 
district heard the case, the report said. The range for fines was 1 
percent to 84 percent, and for restitution, 3 percent to 49 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``For example, offenders convicted of fraud in the Eastern  
District of Pennsylvania, which includes Philadelphia, were 13 more 
times likely to be ordered to pay a fine and three times more 
likely to be ordered to pay restitution than fraud offenders in the 
Eastern District of New York, which includes Brooklyn,'' Stana 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	People convicted of drug trafficking crimes in the Western  
District of Texas were 99 times more likely to be fined than people 
convicted of the same offense in the Central District of 
California, which includes Los Angeles, the GAO study found. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, while only 1 percent of drug offenders overall were  
ordered to pay restitution, nearly 66 percent of fraud offenders 
were ordered to pay it, the GAO report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other factors affecting the numbers were the offender's sex,  
race and citizenship, as well as educational levels, length of 
sentence and whether the sentence involved a prison term, probation 
or an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO study did not examine whether fines or restitution  
ordered actually were paid. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors and court administrators told the GAO that some of  
the differences can be attributed to the type and nature of the 
offenses and differing court management cultures. They also said it 
was probably too early to gauge the effect of the law, since 
officials and prosecutors likely still need time to become familiar 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
	People convicted of a federal crime can be ordered to pay a fine  
or restitution at sentencing. Criminal fines, which are punitive, 
are given to the Justice Department's Crime Victims Fund. A judge 
can waive them if an offender cannot pay. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mandatory Victims Restitution Act changed restitution law by  
requiring judges to order full restitution to each victim in 
certain cases -- those involving crimes of violence, some property 
offenses, tampering with consumers products, and offenses involving 
fraud or deceit, for example. Previously, judges could waive 
restitution in those cases based on an offender's ability to pay.

	U.N. Gets Big Role in Kosovo Plan

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The new peacekeeping plan for Kosovo approved  
by the United States, Russia and six other nations is designed to 
win over Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic while ensuring 
ethnic Albanian refugees can return to their homes in safety. It 
assigns a prominent role to the United Nations, which could have an 
impact on the troops' mission if Russia, China or other Security 
Council members that opposed NATO's air campaign are able to limit 
the weapons the troops carry or the force they can apply to protect 
returned refugees.

Milosevic's ethnic cleansing campaign. Assessing the operation so 
far, an alliance general said Yugoslav forces in Kosovo were

successful strikes -- including heavy artillery, tanks, command

All-American led the Spartans to the Final Four of the NCAA 
tournament, where they lost to Duke. Two of his peers -- Duke's 
Elton Brand, and Connecticut's Richard Hamilton -- already decided 
to leave school early.

	House Approves $13.1B for Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House tonight approved $13.1 billion for  
the fight with Yugoslavia and to buttress U.S. forces around the 
globe. The measure would more than double the $6.05 billion 
President Clinton requested last month to wage the air war through 
September and care for hundreds of thousands of refugees who have 
fled Kosovo. The additions include $1.1 billion to buy missiles and 
bombs, $1.3 billion for spare parts, $1.8 billion to improve 
troops' pay and pensions, and $1.1 billion to modernize military 
bases, mostly in Europe.

	Milosevic Quiet on New Peace Plan  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan  
Milosevic yet to comment on a plan devised by the West and Russia 
that could halt NATO's around-the-clock air assault. The plan, 
however, is built on premises his government had previously 
rejected. But with Russia acting as Yugoslavia's broker over the 
past weeks in trying to wrest a settlement from NATO, there are 
reasons Milosevic may agree to at least negotiate seriously on the 
international plan. Milosevic has said airstrikes must stop as part 
of any settlement of the Kosovo crisis.

	Cops Escape Shooting Charges  
</P>
<P>
	RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) -- Four police officers were justified  
when they fired 23 bullets at a young black woman they found 
sitting armed and unresponsive in a disabled car, a prosecutor said 
today. Riverside County District Attorney Grover Trask said the 
officers may have acted hastily and made mistakes in judgment, but 
did not act criminally when they killed Tyisha Miller, 19, in 
December. Ms. Miller's death led to allegations that the officers -- 
three whites and a Hispanic -- were racists.

	School Violence Solutions Debated  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Schools must fight violence on many fronts --  
from increasing counseling for troubled students to keeping weapons 
out of schools with metal detectors -- educators and safety experts 
told a Senate panel today. Policymakers and school leaders are 
asking whether violence prevention or tighter security is the way 
to go. A Cleveland school safety official said many education 
officials don't want their schools to get a reputation for being 
unsafe, so they are reluctant to install metal detectors or take 
other precautions.

	Jury Deliberates 'Jenny Jones' Case

<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Jurors began deliberating today whether  
producers of ``The Jenny Jones Show'' did ``everything ... except 
pull the trigger'' when a guest was killed after taping the 
program. Lawyers for the plaintiffs urged jurors to award $71.5 
million in damages, saying the talk show and its corporate owner, 
Warner Bros., were liable for the shooting death of Scott Amedure. 
Amedure, who was gay, was killed after revealing his crush on 
another male guest.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Microsoft is investing $5 billion in AT&AMP;T in a

won't be left out in AT&AMP;T's plan to use cable TV wires for Internet 
access, telephone calls and entertainment. The companies said today 
they will pick three cities to test a new, pay-one-bill service 
featuring interactive TV with phone service, e-mail and other 
Internet features -- all through one, super-fast cable. Just 
yesterday, AT&AMP;T reached an agreement to acquire MediaOne, the 
nation's fourth-largest cable provider.

	Court Strikes U.S. Encryption Rules  
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Government limits on the export of computer  
encryption codes, which scramble data to prevent eavesdropping, is 
a violation of freedom of expression, a federal appeals court ruled 
today. The ruling is a blow to the Clinton administration, which 
limits exports of the most powerful encryption technology because 
it fears law enforcement agencies won't be able to read the 
messages of criminals or terrorists. But the high-tech industry 
wants relaxed restrictions so it can take advantage of the market 
for encryption programs as Internet commerce increases.

	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Major league owners will not approve  
Miles Prentice's proposed $75 million bid to buy the Kansas City 
Royals because his group has too many investors, a high-ranking 
baseball official told The Associated Press. Prentice, a New York 
lawyer who has pursued the team for almost two years, will be asked 
to reform his group with fewer investors, the official said. The 
Prentice group numbers between 40 and 50, including golfer Tom 
Watson and Negro Leagues baseball star Buck O'Neil.

<HEADLINE> 76ers Pres. Shaves Head For Playoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia 76ers president Pat Croce has a  
new look for the NBA playoffs -- a bald head. 
</P>
<P>
	He had promised to shave it if his team made the postseason.  
</P>
<P>
	``It looks great!'' Sixers bald center Matt Geiger said, rubbing  
Croce's scalp. ``Needs some sun, though!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Croce got the haircut Thursday as the Sixers prepared for their  
first-round series against Orlando. It was the latest stunt by the 
self-made millionaire whose antics and enthusiasm finally have been 
rewarded with a successful season. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday night, Croce surprised everyone when he slid down a  
rope from the ceiling of the First Union Center between the first 
and second quarters of Philadelphia's overtime win over Detroit. He 
traveled the last 50 feet upside down, then ran around the court 
throwing Sixers playoff T-shirts into the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to get the crowd juiced,'' Croce said.  
</P>
<P>
	At practice Thursday, he removed his baseball cap with a  
sweeping gesture and held his arms in the air as if to say, ``Ta 
da!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Brown, the Sixers' button-down coach, could only chuckle.  
</P>
<P>
	``I told my wife that I thought about doing that a while back,''  
Brown said. ``And she said Pat doing it is enough. I've never had 
an owner like this. He's a unique kind of guy. If anybody deserves 
our team having success, it's Pat.''

<HEADLINE> Docs in Cancer Case Give Up Licenses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATTLEBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Two pathologists accused of mistakenly  
diagnosing 19 men as free of prostate cancer when they actually had 
the disease have volunteered to give up their medical licenses 
temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Board of Registration in Medicine said Wednesday the  
two doctors, John C. DuVally and F. John J. Krolikowski, signed 
agreements not to practice medicine for 60 days, pending a medical 
board investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreements do not preclude the medical board from taking  
disciplinary action. Should the investigation take longer than two 
months, the suspensions could be extended. 
</P>
<P>
	DuVally signed the agreement Tuesday, Krolikowski on Friday.  
Both doctors have left Sturdy Memorial Hospital. Their phone 
numbers are unlisted and neither could be reached for comment 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Between January 1995 and December 1997, the two pathologists  
allegedly misread 20 biopsies on 19 patients, incorrectly telling 
the men they were free of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the patients later died of unrelated causes, the hospital  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sturdy Memorial discovered the errors last month after a review  
of 279 tests prompted by a urologist who discovered one of his 
patients had been misdiagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Sturdy Hospital last week said it had hired a consultant to  
retest 6,000 tissue samples. A hospital representative did not 
return telephone calls seeking comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital's president and CEO, Linda Shyavitz, has said the  
hospital now requires two pathologists to read all breast and 
prostate biopsies, along with similar checks on other tests.

<HEADLINE>  Bulls Honor Phil Jackson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Phil Jackson will be back at the United Center  
again, maybe even as early as next season if he finds a team that 
intrigues him and the offer is right. 
</P>
<P>
	But this was the last time Chicago Bulls' fans could claim  
Jackson as their own, and they savored every minute of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to thank you from my heart. I think this has been a  
wonderful night,'' he said Wednesday as he was honored during a 
halftime ceremony. ``We had a wonderful nine years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it's truly over now. Almost 11 months after Jackson roared  
off on his Harley-Davidson with a sixth NBA championship, the Bulls 
hung a banner with his name right next to Michael Jordan's in the 
rafters. 
</P>
<P>
	There were gifts, including a $10,000 donation in his name by  
the Bulls to the Oglala Sioux tribe, and tributes from his former 
coaches and assistants during the 20-minute ceremony. Even Michael 
Jordan sent his regards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if you get another job somewhere else, you'll always be  
known as the Chicago Bulls' head coach,'' Jordan said in a 
videotaped greeting. ``So I wish you the best. If you need me, give 
me a yell. But not for playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fans were on their feet and yelling as soon as Bulls  
broadcaster Johnny ``Red'' Kerr introduced Jackson. When the former 
coach walked on the floor, the noise in the United Center rose to a 
level not heard since last season. 
</P>
<P>
	In nine seasons with the Bulls, Jackson compiled a 545-193  
record and was coach of all six of their championship teams. He has 
higher winning percentages, .738 overall and .733 in the playoffs, 
of any coach in NBA history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been looking forward to this all year long. It's about  
the only thing I have looked forward to,'' Tex Winter, an assistant 
to Jackson and new coach Tim Floyd, said as the crowd roared. 
</P>
<P>
	But the night wasn't a complete lovefest. When Jackson thanked  
chairman Jerry Reinsdorf, there were loud boos. Jackson ignored the 
fans and went on to thank general manager Jerry Krause, drawing 
even more boos. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans blame Reinsdorf and Krause for running off Jackson and  
breaking up the six-time champions. While both were there -- Jackson 
sat in Reinsdorf's box for part of the game -- neither was on the 
floor for the halftime ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to encourage you all to remain Bulls basketball fans,''  
Jackson said. ``We had a wonderful time, didn't we?'' 
</P>
<P>
	And then Jackson was gone, leaving the floor for good with his  
family as the Grateful Dead's ``Trucking'' began playing. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a much different -- and much happier -- goodbye than  
Jackson's last exit. When he zoomed off on his Harley-Davidson last 
summer, he was burned out and sick of the squabbling with Krause. 
He was so weary he didn't know if he ever wanted to coach again. 
</P>
<P>
	But a year off has done wonders. The bags and shadows under  
Jackson's eyes are gone, and he looks about 10 years younger. His 
rancor toward Krause has eased, and he said there was never any 
animosity toward Reinsdorf. 
</P>
<P>
	He talks regularly with Winter and assistant Frank Hamblen, and  
occasionally with Floyd. He even watched a few Bulls games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course it's been heartrending to see them lose to the Miami  
Heat with only 49 points. But they won last Saturday with 101,'' he 
said. ``(But) I think I was spared a lot of remorse probably and a 
lot of heartache perhaps. ... In my regard, it was something for 
myself in which I wasn't going to be able to compare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has no doubt the Bulls would have been ``at the top of the  
heap'' if they'd stayed together one more year, but he has no 
regrets about leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad about retiring at the appropriate time,'' he said.  
``I have no regrets at all. I don't think there could have been a 
greater scenario than to have been part of this thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson thought a year off would give him time to find something  
else to occupy his mind, but he found he still loves the NBA. Some 
teams already have contacted him through his attorney, Todd 
Musburger, but there haven't been any serious negotiations, nor has 
Jackson made any decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basketball is, right now, a sport in which many people say  
still needs leadership and direction from coaching,'' he said, 
``and that is an arena that intrigues me still.''

<HEADLINE> Beer Ad in Gay Mag Draws Response </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A Budweiser advertisement showing two men  
holding hands in a free magazine for gays and lesbians has drawn so 
much response that Anheuser-Busch Inc. set up special hotlines to 
handle calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad for Bud Light in the April 22 issue of EXP magazine says  
``Be Yourself and Make It a Bud Light,'' and carries a tagline 
saying ``Proud Sponsor of the St. Louis PrideFest '99.'' PrideFest 
is a gay and lesbian festival held in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the ad ran, leaders in the gay community began  
distributing e-mail, urging people to call Anheuser-Busch in 
support of the ad. The St. Louis brewer was so overwhelmed with 
calls that it set up a hotline for supporters to use. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative Christian leader Jerry Falwell subsequently urged  
his followers to call Anheuser-Busch, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's keep the heat on Anheuser-Busch so that they understand  
that pro-family Americans are terribly concerned about homosexual 
images coming into our homes through reckless advertising 
campaigns,'' Falwell wrote in his Falwell Confidential. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's surprising to us that one print ad placed in select  
gay-oriented magazines has attracted attention,'' the St. Louis 
brewer said in a written statement. ``Today's consumer is not one 
of a specific gender, race, geography or orientation. We appreciate 
and respect the views of all our customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anheuser-Busch officials declined to comment about the results  
of the calls or whether they will have any effect on further plans 
for the advertisement. 
</P>
<P>
	Falwell was unavailable for comment Thursday, his spokesman  
said.

<HEADLINE> Businesses Reel From Tornadoes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIDWEST CITY, Okla. (AP) -- A handmade sign lay propped against  
the mountain of twisted metal, soggy insulation and crumbled 
sheetrock that once was a Super Surplus store: ``Clearance Sale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was an appropriate message in a two-block area leveled by a  
monster tornado Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Silsby, an owner of the store, used his fingers to count  
off the 15 or so family-owned businesses that once lined the 
heavily traveled street. An automotive repair business, a tire 
store, a lawn mower shop. They all looked the same -- nothing but 
rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday was the shock of, `I've lost everything,''' he said  
Wednesday. ``Now it doesn't matter. We can replace it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Jim Anderson, putting back the pieces will be a little more  
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	The same tornado that destroyed his used-motorcycle shop in  
Midwest City stopped first in Moore to suck up his house and 
hundreds of others. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it hasn't sunk in yet,'' he said. ``Yesterday,  
I woke up and said, `It has to be a dream.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The nightmare is far from over for dozens of business owners  
devastated by Monday's storms, which killed at least 41 people in 
Oklahoma and five in Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	The business owners must negotiate with insurance companies,  
hope for a fair and quick settlement, and eventually -- if they can 
manage it -- get back to business. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial help is available for businesses located within the  
counties designated as federal disaster areas. They are eligible 
for low-interest and long-term Small Business Administration loans 
and can file an amended federal tax extension to deduct their 
property losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitch Morris said he hopes to work out a speedy insurance  
settlement so he can start rebuilding his engine repair business. 
</P>
<P>
	But first he must figure out a way to untwist the giant steel  
frames that were used to hoist vehicles weighing up to 9,000 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``See those big blue posts?'' Anderson said. ``The tornado just  
picked them up and twisted them around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two blocks away at Second Hand Sports, owner John Coles boarded  
up huge panels of broken glass. 
</P>
<P>
	His business is one of the few in the area still standing. And  
despite the blown-out windows, many of the basketballs, exercise 
benches and weightlifting gloves still neatly line the shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, who had no insurance to cover the contents of his  
business, says he lost about $10,000 in merchandise. And he doesn't 
know if his landlord will repair the building. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just glad I have another job,'' said Coles, who works as  
an aircraft mechanic at the nearby Tinker Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
	Just south of the strip of businesses are four motels that front  
Interstate 40. Three were demolished in Monday's storm. The power 
remained off at the fourth, La Quinta Inn. 
</P>
<P>
	The owner of Comfort Inn said he was too upset to talk about his  
loss. The 150-room hotel is missing its roof and the walls are 
askew, as in a Jenga game ready to topple. 
</P>
<P>
	In Midwest City, 124 businesses were hit by the storm and at  
least 20 were heavily damaged, said Stan Greil, president of the 
city's chamber of commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma City Mayor Kirk Humphreys said 16 business were  
destroyed in his city and nine received major damage. At least 
eight businesses were destroyed in Choctaw and more than 10 were 
hit when the storm passed through Dell City.

letter'' from FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky confirming that ``there 
is a very serious, ongoing investigation both of gas prices in 
California and also two merger applications that are before the 
FTC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those proposed mergers involve Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. and  
BP Amoco PLC and Atlantic Richfield Co. 
</P>
<P>
	High gas prices have fueled anger in California where drivers  
are paying around $2 a gallon for premium in some spots. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices across the country jumped with the Organization of the  
Petroleum Exporting Countries announcing production cuts to boost 
sagging oil prices, but California has been hardest hit, according 
to analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	Fires at two refineries in Northern California cut into  
supplies, and the state's decision to remove an additive from 
gasoline helped boost the cost, the analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	But service station dealers and other oil company critics  
discount industry explanations, saying world crude oil price 
increases would not account for the retail spike in the state and 
that reported supplies are higher than previous years. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC, at Boxer's request, began looking into the effect of  
proposed oil company mergers on gasoline costs and possible 
violation of antitrust laws last year during a price spike. 
</P>
<P>
	Skyrocketing prices this year prompted California Attorney  
General Bill Lockyer to investigate. His office, which declined 
Thursday to comment on any developments, is working with the FTC. 
</P>
<P>
	Major oil companies are cooperating fully with the  
investigations, said Anita Mangels, a spokeswoman for the Western 
States Petroleum Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is nothing new. They've been looking at this for quite  
some time. We're confident that this inquiry will show that the 
allegations are unfounded and that competition is alive and well in 
California,'' Mangels said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his May 4 letter to Boxer, the FTC chairman said the  
commission ``places great importance on its investigations of the 
level of gasoline prices in California and of the proposed 
mergers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The commission is thoroughly investigating pricing activities  
in those markets to determine whether the recent increases were in 
whole or in part the result of anticompetitive conduct,'' Pitofsky 
said.

<HEADLINE> Hawks Taking Aim at Pistons  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Hawks can't escape their past.  
</P>
<P>
	Since moving from St. Louis in 1968, the Hawks have yet to  
advance beyond the second round of the playoffs, an anvil of 
underachievement that hangs over the franchise every time the 
postseason rolls around. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a legitimate knock against us,'' general manager Pete  
Babcock said. ``I can't argue with it. We have not gotten past the 
second round. That's a fact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta finished second in the Central Division, two games  
behind Indiana, but clinched the No. 4 seed and homecourt advantage 
in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs with a 
victory over Washington in the final regular-season game. 
</P>
<P>
	The best-of-5 series against the Detroit Pistons opens Saturday  
night at the Georgia Dome. Game 2 will be Monday before the series 
shifts to the Palace of Auburn Hills. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven times since 1986, Atlanta has been knocked out of the  
playoffs in the second round. The Hawks didn't even make it that 
far a year ago, dropping a four-game series to Charlotte in the 
first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, they've got to beat Detroit before addressing their  
second-round futility. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to do better than in the past,'' Babcock said. ``Our  
mission statement is simple: We want to win a championship, nothing 
less.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pistons enter the playoffs on a roll, having won six  
straight before an overtime loss at Philadelphia on Wednesday. 
Detroit, which features Grant Hill and former Hawk Christian 
Laettner, took the season series 2-1, winning on the lone visit to 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to go into the playoffs with momentum,'' Pistons  
coach Alvin Gentry said after the 105-100 loss to the 76ers. ``I 
don't think we lost any with this game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the retirement of Michael Jordan and collapse of the  
six-time NBA champion Chicago Bulls, everyone in the East feels 
this might be the year to make a run at the title. Only six games 
separated top-seeded Miami from No. 8 New York after the 
abbreviated 50-game schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a chance to do something very big in Atlanta,'' said  
Hawks forward Grant Long, who takes a personal element into the 
series after spending the last two seasons languishing on the 
Detroit bench. ``We don't get a lot of press, a lot of accolades. 
But I think we're the team to beat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Long, who averaged 19.3 points over the final three  
regular-season games, could play a large role against his former 
team. Alan Henderson is hampered by an abrasion on his left eye, 
making him doubtful for Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's still seeing with double vision,'' coach Lenny Wilkens  
said. ``He's seeing better, but it's a slow process. I would have 
to say he won't be ready for the first game unless he makes a 
miraculous recovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson suffered through a series of injuries and LaPhonso  
Ellis played only 20 games before a hernia ended his season, giving 
the Hawks a chance to demonstrate a much deeper bench than the past 
couple of seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta didn't slip at all when Long filled in for Henderson at  
strong forward and second-year player Chris Crawford took over 
Ellis' small forward position. Anthony Johnson and Tyrone Corbin 
also get extensive playing time off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``If somebody's not going well, somebody off the bench can give  
you the minutes,'' Corbin said. ``That's a big key in the playoffs. 
It also helps to be able to give the other team some different 
looks.''

<HEADLINE> Lawsuit Over Atlanta Olympic Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The group that initiated Atlanta's bid for the  
1996 Olympics is suing to stop the state from forcing it to open 
thousands of additional boxes of records to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	The Georgia Amateur Athletic Foundation filed suit late  
Wednesday after receiving a letter from Georgia Attorney General 
Thurbert Baker, who threatened legal action if the additional files 
were not opened. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation opened nine boxes of documents last week.  
</P>
<P>
	Baker's letter said the files should be made public because of  
the ``overwhelmingly public nature of the 1996 Olympics (and) the 
inextricable link between private interests and government entities 
in the pursuit'' of the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Roy Barnes already has said the records should be opened.  
</P>
<P>
	The foundation's suit asked the court to preserve ``the  
established rights to privacy of the foundation's donors, 
volunteers and staff,'' said Lee Echols, a spokesman for the 
foundation, which Billy Payne created in 1987 to begin Atlanta's 
Olympic bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation has been embroiled in a legal dispute with The  
Atlanta Journal-Constitution over the records related to Atlanta's 
bid for the 1996 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker helped strike a deal between the newspaper and the  
foundation that he says was intended to open all records, without 
litigation, except those that would be exempted under the Open 
Records Act. 
</P>
<P>
	But Baker said records were withheld for privacy reasons with no  
explanation of what those papers contained. He also said such 
records could not be withheld entirely -- they could only be 
redacted to remove private information. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker also said he understood archivists were deciding which  
papers to withhold instead of the foundation's lawyers. He said 
such decisions are legal ones and should be handled by attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker said if the terms of his letter are not agreed to by  
Friday, ``I will initiate litigation'' to determine if the records 
should be opened. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked later about the foundation's suit, Baker said, ``If they  
want to litigate this in court, we'll litigate this in court.''

<HEADLINE> Poundstone Vision to 'Home Movies' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- Paula Poundstone's new comedy  
series, ``Home Movies,'' had a spare, engagingly wobbly style of 
animation that its creators have dubbed Squigglevision. 
</P>
<P>
	Seems fitting for Poundstone. Her world, by her own description,  
appears to be done in a kind of Paulavision -- equally funny and 
equally unsteady on its feet. 
</P>
<P>
	It's certainly a rich world. Besides providing the mother's  
voice in ``Home Movies,'' a wry little gem airing 8:30 p.m. EDT 
Monday on UPN, Poundstone is a fixture on the club and campus scene 
with her stand-up act. 
</P>
<P>
	She's a frequent TV talk show guest, has produced a children's  
audio book and is a real-life single mom to two daughters. And she 
regularly expands her household to include foster children, such as 
the 11-month-old boy who recently joined the circle. 
</P>
<P>
	Can a comedian, one with a dry-as-dust wit and her own new world  
order, be a typical mom in any regard? You be the judge, based on 
these actual Poundstone comments: 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``I have really pretty, pretty kids, which makes me suspect my  
next one's going to be an ugly baby. The odds are really good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``I used to watch 'The Waltons' and just sob, not because the  
episodes were that moving but because my family was nothing like 
that. I figured if I came from a bigger family there'd be at least 
one person that I liked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``At the end of last summer, I was diagnosed with  
obsessive-compulsive disorder. One thing I always did was scrub the 
kitchen floor every night. I don't do it every night now, but I am 
constantly looking around at home to see if there's a place that 
needs a little spot job. ... My daughter told me, 'You're VERY 
strict about the floor.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	That off-kilter take on life helped give birth to ``Home  
Movies.'' The show is from the same company, Tom Snyder 
Productions, that makes ABC's kid's program ``SquiggleVision'' 
(formerly ``Science Court'') and ``Dr. Katz: Professional 
Therapist.'' The ABC show is named for the quivering animation 
process used in ``Dr. Katz'' and ``Home Movies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the course of lending her voice via telephone hookup to ABC's  
``SquiggleVision,'' Poundstone entertained the producers with tales 
from the home front. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be telling them about how things were going at home,  
which generally wasn't well, telling one frustrating story after 
another about my kids. They got approached to make a show about 
family for UPN, so they said, 'Why don't you just do what you were 
doing over the phone for us?''' Poundstone recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	The result is ``Home Movies,'' about divorced mom Paula Small  
(Poundstone), her precocious, 8-year-old son Brendon -- a budding 
Steven Spielberg armed with a video camera and a taste for mischief 
-- and baby Josie. 
</P>
<P>
	(UPN has committed to a five-episode run for the series, which  
debuted April 26, so catch it quick.) 
</P>
<P>
	In the first episode, Paula Small goes on a really bad date with  
the school's dense soccer coach, Mr. McGuirk (voiced by H. Jon 
Benjamin of ``Dr. Katz''), who admits to an excess of ``trademarked 
products'' tattoos on his body. 
</P>
<P>
	``Excuse me, waiter, can I get another one of these as soon as  
possible?'' says the despairing cartoon Paula, cocktail glass in 
hand. ``I'm not supposed to mix it with medication, but I'm going 
to make a rare exception to the rule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Poundstone contributes to the show's often ad-libbed  
dialogue, she judges some of it to be a tad unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have the 8-year-old who makes movies, and I have an  
8-year-old, and maybe she's slightly mature. But recently, at her 
sister's birthday party, I let her borrow the camera and we got 
pictures of the drinks at the table, people's heads cut off. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they guessed wrong about how a kid would be at 8, but  
that's the beauty of television,'' said Poundstone. Much of it, she 
says, is pretty unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of TV is something people can't relate to. I'm not sure  
anybody will exactly be able to relate to this, but hopefully 
they'll think it's funny. I don't think anybody will go, 'Oh, my 
family's just like that. 
</P>
<P>
	``For one thing'' -- she pauses a comic beat -- ``they're  
cartoons. 'My mom was erased once'; no one's going to say that.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	After nibbling neatly on miniature crab cakes and potato chips  
at a seaside hotel, Poundstone must bring this interview to a 
close. Checking her watch, she mentions that one of her girls has a 
physical therapy appointment. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has cerebral palsy. Unless she's faking it,'' says  
Poundstone, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
	That's Paulavision, no doubt about it.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ....  
</P>
<P>
	EXPECTATIONS ARE HIGH: Ioan Gruffudd, a swashbuckling standout  
in A&AMP;E's ``Horatio Hornblower'' miniseries, takes on the role of 
Pip in PBS' new production of Charles Dickens' ``Great 
Expectations.'' The Mobil Masterpiece Theatre miniseries, airing 
9-11 p.m. EDT Sunday and Monday (May 9-10), also features Justine 
Waddell, Charlotte Rampling and Bernard Hill. Orphaned Pip learns 
about life and love at the hands of the cold Estella, manipulative 
Miss Havisham and a mysterious benefactor.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Dallas Cowboy Mark Tuinei Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLANO, Texas (AP) -- Mark Tuinei, who helped lead the Dallas  
Cowboys to three Super Bowl championships during his 15-year 
career, died this morning after a friend found him unconscious in 
his car. He was 39. 
</P>
<P>
	Plano police chief Bruce Glasscock said the unidentified friend  
had been called and told to pick up Tuinei, and found him in a 
vehicle outside his home. After the man called for help, firemen 
tried to revive Tuinei, but he was pronounced dead upon arriving at 
Medical Center of Plano. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of death was not immediately known. Glasscock said  
foul play, alcohol or drugs were not believed to be involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing in the investigation at this time that would  
indicate that,'' Glasscock said. ``We're treating this like any 
other unattended death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glasscock said the medical examiner could have a preliminary  
report by mid-afternoon. However, he said it could take days for 
any definitive information from an autopsy or toxicology reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Glasscock said Tuinei was not known to have had a  
life-threatening medical condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief said he wasn't sure how long Tuinei had been  
unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only information we have at this point is that it was a  
good portion of the morning,'' he said. ``The friend was contacted 
and asked to pick up Mr. Tuinei. We're still in the process of 
interviewing that friend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glasscock said he didn't know whether the man was a member of  
the Cowboys. Tuinei's wife was in Hawaii, where they both are from, 
and was notified by family members. They did not have children. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do know Mr. Tuinei was in Dallas last night,'' Glassock  
said. ``Our goal is trying to backtrack the last 24 hours of Mr. 
Tuinei's activities in an effort to find someone who can provide us 
with any further information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-5, 320-pound Tuinei came to the Cowboys in 1983 as a  
free agent from Hawaii and made the team as a defensive lineman. He 
was switched to offense in 1985 and became a full-time starter in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuinei played several spots along the offensive line but settled  
in at the crucial position of left tackle, where he was responsible 
for blocking the quarterback's blind side. 
</P>
<P>
	His protection of Troy Aikman and his run-blocking for Emmitt  
Smith were big reasons why the Cowboys went from 1-15 in 1989 to 
Super Bowl champions in 1993, 1994 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuinei played in the Pro Bowl after the 1994 and 1995 seasons.  
Knee problems ended his career after the 1997 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mark has been an example to everybody on this team,'' Cowboys  
owner Jerry Jones said when Tuinei released in April 1998 as a 
cost-cutting move. ``He's played hurt at a really superhuman level, 
and obviously, we've had some great success during his career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate comment from the Cowboys or players.  
</P>
<P>
	Will Morris, a friend who arrived at Tuinei's sprawling mansion  
this morning, said he last saw Tuinei about 6 p.m. Wednesday. 
Tuinei and his wife were planning to move back to Hawaii this week 
so Tuinei could be offensive line coach at his old high school, 
Punahou High School, Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never seemed healthier or happier about going home. He was  
happy as can be,'' said Morris, who also attended the private 
school and met Tuinei at a Texas reunion of Punahou alumni about 
five years ago.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Dip; Dow Falls 8.59 Points / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices fluctuated Thursday but ended lower  
as cautionary remarks by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan 
fed investors' increasing worries about inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 8.59 at 10,946.82.  
The Dow fell as much as 103 points during the day, then tried but 
failed to recover ground just before the close. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader market indicators also were mostly lower. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was down 15.26 at 1,332.05, and the Nasdaq 
composite index was down 62.16 at 2,472.28. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors are increasingly concerned that the robust economy  
will reawaken inflation and prompt the Fed to push rates higher 
when its policy writers meet in two weeks. Higher rates are the 
market's nemesis because they can quickly eat into corporate 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	In remarks to bankers in Chicago, Greenspan praised the  
performance of the U.S. economy in recent years, but warned that 
gains in productivity cannot keep inflation at bay forever. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I have said on previous occasions, there are imbalances in  
our expansion that, unless redressed, will bring this long run of 
strong growth and low inflation to a close,'' he said. He said 
tight labor markets, for example, could ultimately threaten the 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	As he has in the past, Greenspan also expressed concern that the  
high-flying stock market could suddenly come back to earth, causing 
a reversal of the wealth effect that has powered consumer spending 
</P>
<P>
	His morning speech caused already jittery stock and bond markets  
to fall throughout the day. The Treasury's 30-year bond carried a 
yield of 5.78 percent, its highest level since June. The bond had 
closed late Wednesday with a yield of 5.70 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hawkish tone from Greenspan is shaking the trees of growth  
stocks and, as a result, continuing to put downward pressure on 
growth and financial stocks,'' said Tom Galvin, chief equity 
strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial services stocks were particularly hard hit by the  
interest rate worries. The discount broker Schwab Corp. fell 4 1/8 to 
103 3/8, while Chase Manhattan was down 2 5/8 to 77 9/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail stocks also felt the pinch, despite the announcement  
Thursday that many big storeowners had better-than-expected sales 
in April. Gap Inc. fell 5 1/4 to 64 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T rose 5 to 61 15/16 after announcing that Microsoft will  
invest $5 billion in the telecommunications company. In return, 
AT&AMP;T said it will increase its use of Microsoft's software. 
Microsoft fell 1 3/16 to 77 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, AT&AMP;T negotiated its victory in a bidding war with  
Comcast over MediaOne Group Inc., the nation's fourth-largest cable 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Internet stocks fell Thursday, perhaps at the threat from  
the Microsoft-AT&AMP;T communications alliance. Intel fell 4 5/16 to 59 
11/16, while Amazon.com slipped 9 1/8 to 137 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancers outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the New  
York Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume came to 1.056 
billion shares, down from Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 4.32 at 636.22, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was up 2.32 at 787.81. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index, which reflects the performance of  
smaller-company stocks, fell 0.89 at 433.38. 
</P>
<P>
	European stocks were little changed. The CAC 40 in Paris ended  
0.79 percent lower, London's FTSE 100 index closed down 0.07 
percent, and the DAX in Frankfurt dropped 0.61 percent. In Tokyo, 
the Nikkei rose 3.58 percent.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Fall; Dow Down 54.40 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell today, pulled down by a jump in bond  
market yields that revived fears of rising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 54.40 at 10,901.01. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was down 10.18 at 1,337.13, and the Nasdaq 
composite index was down 11.78 at 2,522.67. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest rates have replaced earnings reports as the main focus  
of the market. There are increasing worries among investors that 
the strong economy will revive inflation and prompt the Federal 
Reserve to push rates higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind today's uncertain start was a jump in bond market yields.  
The Treasury's 30-year bond carried a yield of 5.77 percent, up 
sharply from late Wednesday's 5.70 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Cautious optimism by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan  
also caught the market's attention. He called the U.S. economy's 
performance phenomenal, and cited the country's high productivity, 
but Greenspan warned that the global recovery from a severe 
financial crisis remains fragile. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial services stocks were down amid the nervousness over  
interest rates. J.P. Morgan was down 2 3/16 at 136 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest retailers released mostly better than  
expected sales figures for April. But Wal-Mart was down 2 at 43 
1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-6 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 286.45 million

<HEADLINE> Brazil Autoworkers Threaten Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Fearing mass dismissals with the end of  
a job-saving, sales-boosting agreement, Brazilian autoworkers today 
threatened to bring the assembly lines of local car factories to a 
complete standstill. 
</P>
<P>
	In what one labor leader said was ``prelude to a general  
strike,'' some 20,000 workers from the Brazilian subsidiaries of 
Ford Motor Co., Volkswagen AG and DaimlerChrysler AG's Mercedes 
Benz unit marched through the streets of Sao Bernardo do Campo, the 
industrial suburb of Sao Paulo where the automakers are 
headquartered. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not accept a single dismissal,'' said Luiz Marinho,  
president of the Sao Bernardo do Campo Metalworkers Union. ``If we 
have to, we'll unleash a general strike and stop the factories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The union's growing concerns of unemployment came to a head on  
Tuesday when automakers hiked car prices by up to 10 percent, 
effectively bringing to an end a tax-reduction agreement aimed at 
saving thousands of jobs and increasing sales. 
</P>
<P>
	In early March, the government, manufacturers and labor unions  
signed an agreement that cut the federal excise tax levied on cars 
by up to 13 percentage points, depending on the model. Some states 
also trimmed their taxes by three percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers agreed not to raise prices or lay off workers for at  
least 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement helped the industry recover from a months-long  
slump caused by high interest rates and recession. By the end of 
March sales had soared 236 percent from a month earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts to extend the agreement for at least another 30 days  
failed as automakers insisted on hiking their prices to compensate, 
they said, for increased costs of imported components caused by the 
January devaluation of Brazil's currency, the real. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Carlos Pinheiro Neto, president of the National Association  
of Vehicle Manufacturers, on Thursday said manufacturers couldn't 
afford to keep producing cars at a loss. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first three months of the year, Brazil's big four  
manufacturers -- Volkswagen, Fiat SpA, General Motors Corp. and Ford 
-- lost about $774 million, according to a study by Ernst and Young, 
Pinehiro Neto said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's secretary of Industrial Policy, Helio Mattar, said the  
government hopes to resume negotiations with manufacturers, the 
Estado news agency reported. He also asked manufacturers to ``be 
sensible'' and not raise prices until a new agreement is reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattar said the government is willing to maintain the lower  
taxes on cars with some price increases by manufacturers, but will 
ask automakers to prove that they've actually suffered losses, the 
report added. 
</P>
<P>
	Neto said manufacturers are open to negotiating an extension of  
the accord, but only if the new agreement allows for price 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, auto sales in April were 16 percent lower than the  
previous month, despite the tax-reduction agreement. Compared to 
April of last year they were 7.9 percent lower. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first four months of the year, Brazilian vehicle sales  
totaled 335,878 units, down 18 percent from the same period last 
year.

<HEADLINE> Warriors Make Progress in 1998-99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- When the Warriors announced Wednesday  
night during their season-ending loss to San Antonio that a lucky 
fan had won a basketball autographed by coach P.J. Carlesimo, there 
were boos in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what happens when a team, despite showing improvement  
over the previous year, finishes with a losing record and out of 
the playoffs for the fifth straight season -- and does little to 
convince fans those streaks won't stretch to six seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, Golden State's 21-29 record in this lockout-shortened  
season was a lot better than the 19-63 mark last season. And there 
were flashes of brilliance down the stretch from rookie Antawn 
Jamison, the Warriors' first productive draft pick in years. 
</P>
<P>
	But a year after Latrell Sprewell choked Carlesimo, depriving  
the Warriors of their best player and turning Golden State from a 
bad team into a woeful club, there perhaps was not enough 
rebuilding to promise better times ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlesimo gave plenty of playing time to veterans such as Terry  
Cummings and Muggsy Bogues, taking those minutes away from young 
players such as Jamison, Erick Dampier, Jason Caffey and Tony Delk. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting center Dampier, who will be eligible for free agency,  
did not play down the stretch in some tight games and might have 
that in mind when he decides whether to re-sign with the Warriors. 
Delk, a backup point guard, already has said he expects to be 
elsewhere next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlesimo defended his decision to go with veterans at times,  
saying he simply was trying to put the best team on the floor as 
the Warriors made a bid for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've found out a lot more about (our young  
players),'' Carlesimo said. ``Had they done better, they'd be 
playing more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though the Warriors led the NBA in rebounding for the second  
straight season, they continued to struggle on offense. Shooting 
guard John Starks, obtained from the New York Knicks as part of the 
Jan. 26 trade for Sprewell, led the team with 13.8 points per game 
-- the lowest team-leading average since the Warriors moved west 
from Philadelphia in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
	But Starks shot just 37 percent, including a 3-for-14  
performance in the season-closer against the Spurs. And the 
Warriors still lack a quality point guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Starks remained upbeat, though, focusing on the team's  
improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	``This organization has been through some tough times the last  
few years, but as you can see they have made a lot of improvements 
to turn that around,'' he said. ``There is a great future ahead for 
us. I look forward to finishing my career here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The future depends a lot on the development of Jamison. Instead  
of picking a point guard such as Jason Williams, who was selected 
after Jamison in the draft and helped lead the Sacramento Kings 
into the playoffs, the Warriors went for a player who had trouble 
adjusting to the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamison was the college player of the year at North Carolina  
last season, but struggled with the switch from power forward to 
small forward. He ended up playing behind Chris Mills and Donyell 
Marshall, and not starting until the 26th game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he played well down the stretch, such as his 22-point,  
16-rebound performance in Wednesday's game against San Antonio, 
Jamison shot poorly from outside and had trouble handing the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know what I've got to do. I know what I need to work on,''  
he said. ``I experienced a lot of downs, and every once in a while 
I got a lot of ups. I think it is good that I struggled a lot this 
year and experienced a lot of lows. Right now it's time for me to 
work and improve every day.''

<HEADLINE> Mutual Fund Assets Are Up / Money Market Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's money market mutual funds  
rose in the latest week, despite a drop in retail funds, the 
Investment Company Institute reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets in retail money market mutual funds, which are held by  
individual investors, fell by $187.4 million in the week ended 
Wednesday to $858.41 billion, the Washington-based mutual fund 
trade group said. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category rose  
by $26.2 million to $713.31 billion, while tax-exempt fund assets 
fell by $213.6 million to $145.11 billion, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of institutional money market funds rose by $7.42 billion  
to $584.21 billion for the same period. Among institutional funds, 
taxable money market fund assets rose by $4.77 billion to $537.09 
billion; assets of tax-exempt funds rose by $2.65 billion to $47.12 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Total money market assets stood at $1.443 trillion for the week.  
</P>
<P>
	Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.435 trillion to  
reflect reporting errors and a change in the number of funds 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in  
the week ended Tuesday to 4.33 percent from 4.28 percent the 
previous week, said IBC's Money Fund Report, a trade journal 
published in Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial Data Inc. But the 
30-day average yield fell to 4.31 percent from 4.32 percent, IBC 
Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day compounded yield rose to 4.42 percent from 4.37  
percent the previous week, while the 30-day compounded yield fell 
to 4.40 percent from 4.41 percent, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was  
61 days, unchanged from a week earlier, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The online, service bankrate.com said its survey of 100 leading  
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks 
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the annual percentage 
yield available on money market accounts fell to 2.09 percent as of 
Wednesday from 2.10 percent a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based unit of Intelligent Life Corp.  
said the annual percentage yield available on interest-bearing 
checking accounts fell to 0.92 percent from 0.93 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bankrate.com said the annual percentage yield was 4.12 percent  
on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 4.13 percent the 
previous week. Yields were 4.36 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 4.34 
percent; 4.47 percent on 2 1/2-year CDs, unchanged from a week 
earlier; and 4.63 percent on 5-year CDs, also unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Huge African Anti-AIDS Effort Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- In the largest single  
corporate commitment to fight AIDS, Bristol-Myers Squibb is 
donating $100 million over five years to speed research and train 
doctors to fight the disease in Africa, the continent hardest hit 
by the epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
	The move Thursday by the world's fifth-largest drug company  
comes amid criticism from government leaders that drugmakers charge 
too much for their AIDS drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will have a tremendous impact,'' said Cornelius Baker,  
executive director of the National Association of People With AIDS, 
based in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol officials said the donation was not in response to  
criticism on drug prices. Rather, company executives said they felt 
a moral obligation. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Hayden, Bristol's president of worldwide medicines, said the  
company, which had $18.3 billion in sales last year, will still 
consider selling AIDS drugs at steep discounts in countries around 
the world. But, he said, no plans are imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol officials said they considered making a massive drug  
donation, but realized drugs alone would do little to stem the 
epidemic. ``That would be benefit for some time but it would not 
change the course of the disease,'' said Barry Scott, vice 
president of Bristol's international division. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to New York-based Bristol, U.N. Secretary-General  
Kofi Annan lauded the effort, saying such partnerships between the 
public and private sectors are ``critical'' in controlling the 
epidemic which has killed 11.5 million people in sub-Saharan Africa 
-- 83 percent of all AIDS deaths worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The program would:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Finance outside research into how best to fight AIDS in five  
southern African countries -- South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, 
Swaziland and Lesotho -- where the epidemic has infected as many as 
one in four people and cut life expectancy by one-quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The research would test various combinations of drugs on an  
estimated 20,000 people over five years. The trials would also test 
other therapies, such as adjusting nutrition to find the most 
effective -- and affordable -- way to fight AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Finance fellowships for African doctors to study at programs  
administered by the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, and 
award fellowships for American physicians to work in the five 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The program would be directed by representatives from  
governments; UNAIDS, a UN advocacy group for fighting AIDS; and 
major medical facilities, including the Harvard AIDS Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	``Working together we can reverse the tide of death,'' Kenneth  
Weg, vice chairman of Bristol, said at a news conference in 
Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Piot, executive director of UNAIDS, challenged other  
corporations to join the initiative, which is part of an expanded 
effort by the corporate world to confront the AIDS epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key thing is to bring in new partners,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative announced  
it had received a $25 million donation from Microsoft Corp. 
chairman Bill Gates. 
</P>
<P>
	Glaxo Wellcome, which produces AZT, recently offered to supply  
the South African government with the anti-AIDS drug at one-third 
of its market price. The government rejected the offer, saying the 
medication still would be too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	In Africa, where few can afford the medicines that are saving  
the lives of AIDS victims in developed countries, the cost of 
pharmaceuticals is a touchy issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the office of Thabo Mbeki, South Africa's deputy  
president, accused drug companies of charging ``exorbitant'' prices 
for anti-AIDS drugs. American officials, for their part, are angry 
that South Africa advocates the use of cheaper generic drugs, 
allegedly violating copyright laws and depriving companies that 
developed the drugs of profits.

<HEADLINE> Blazers Trudge Into Playoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- In practical terms, Portland's  
season-ending game against the Los Angeles Lakers meant nothing. 
Win or lose, the Pacific Division-winning Blazers were seeded No. 2 
in the Western Conference playoffs, and opening at home on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it was the way Portland fell to the Lakers on last night  
-- a 119-91 blowout in the final regular-season game at the LA Forum 
-- that left the Blazers' confidence shaken. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very concerned,'' backup point guard Greg Anthony said.  
``Our biggest opponent right now is ourselves. The commitment is 
not there. We've got too many agendas right now. If we don't 
address them before the playoffs, we're going to have a very short 
run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Portland enters the opening round against No. 7-seeded Phoenix  
having lost two in a row and nine of their last 17. The Suns, on 
the other hand, closed out with nine victories in their last 12 
games, including Wednesday's 100-96 win over Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers won all three games against the Suns this season,  
but Phoenix's Tom Gugliotta was hurt for one game and a non-factor 
in another, and Rex Chapman missed two games with an injury and was 
ejected from the other. Both players are healthy now. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix (27-23) can look at a crucial six-day stretch in late  
April, during which it soundly beat Utah twice and Houston once, as 
a high point during its playoff run. The surge seems to have given 
the Suns the momentum that Portland is lacking. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think teams know we're clicking on all cylinders,''  
Gugliotta said. 
</P>
<P>
	Portland (35-15) had the league's best record for much of the  
season, but struggled on the road, going just 13-12. The only 
playoff-bound teams the Blazers defeated away from home were 
Minnesota, Sacramento and Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	After a 27-point home thrashing of the Lakers on April 13,  
Portland lost nearly every big game it played, falling to Houston, 
Utah and twice each to the Lakers and Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	The slide reached a peak Wednesday night, when the Blazers  
showed little interest in playing defense against the Lakers, 
especially Glen Rice. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers fell behind 34-21 after one quarter but pulled  
within seven at halftime. Rice then hit six of his eight 3-pointers 
in the third quarter, and the Lakers pulled away for the easy 
victory. Rice finished with 40 points, the most anyone scored 
against Portland this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came in here thinking that the game had no influence on us,  
and they played like it meant something to them,'' Blazers coach 
Mike Dunleavy said. ``That wasn't the attitude I was looking for. 
We didn't have any urgency and we didn't have it mentally or 
physically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony, who's often been the spokesman for the Blazers this  
season, was more blunt. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played like a bunch of losers,'' he said. ``We quit,  
period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to give a reason for the Blazers' lackluster play the  
final two weeks of the season, Anthony said, ``I think you'd have 
to go through each individual and ask why. I'm sure there's a 
reason why, but I'm not psychic. I couldn't speak for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of issues that need to be resolved, and we need  
to get back into the business of winning basketball games. Right 
now, we're not concerned with that. I don't see the commitment to 
winning that we had. The commitment has lapsed, and we have to find 
a way to get it back within the next 48 hours.''

<HEADLINE> Dying Doctor Finds Own Replacement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLQUITT, Ga. (AP) -- Dr. Peggy Rummel learned in January that  
liver cancer would likely kill her in eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Wracked with pain, dopey from morphine, she spent the winter  
making things for her family to remember her by. For her extended 
family -- this one-stoplight town in southwestern Georgia peanut 
country -- she searched by phone and Internet to make sure another 
doctor would be in place when she was gone. 
</P>
<P>
	As if by sheer willpower, the 43-year-old redhead with the  
mischievous smile has outlived her prognosis long enough to see her 
wish fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
	``What scared me was the short deadline, pardon the pun. We  
needed the coverage then; we didn't need to wait for me to get over 
feeling sorry for myself,'' she tells a reporter, her tired blue 
eyes filling with tears. ``The idea that, 'Oops, sorry. Nobody's 
here,' is just not acceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just as unacceptable as allowing a boy to miss a visit to a  
specialist because his mother has no car or travel money, as 
unacceptable as letting local children go without an Easter egg 
hunt. Or sending her 18-year-old son, Richard, into adulthood 
without her videotaped letter of advice -- ``In case you get 
married; in case you have children; in case you decide you DON'T 
want to go into medicine ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rummel grew up a state away, in North Augusta, S.C., and knew  
while still at the Medical University of South Carolina that she 
wanted to practice rural medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	When she met the representatives from Miller County (pop. 6,400)  
at a job fair, she knew Colquitt -- with a grain elevator for a 
skyline and an honest-to-goodness hardware store on the courthouse 
square -- was the place for her. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said Miller County was the only group that asked about her  
family,'' says Head Start director Susan Long, whose son, Ashley, 
was the first baby Rummel delivered in Colquitt. 
</P>
<P>
	In 16 years, she's earned the right to call herself a native.  
</P>
<P>
	``She's just meant such a lot,'' says Rita Glass, director of  
lab and X-ray services at Miller County Hospital, who has known 
Rummel since 1983. ``She's done a lot of things for the community 
that they never knew about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When lack of business threatened to close the 38-bed hospital,  
Rummel referred more of her patients, eventually accounting for 
more than half the total business. She worked the emergency room 
two days a week and two or three weekends a month. Along the way, 
she helped raise eight foster children. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband, Larry, says he knew early on he would have to share  
his wife with others. ``It's all I can do to keep up with her,'' he 
says. ``I don't mind saying she's been the brains and the strongest 
one in this outfit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She maintained her pace even through a series of serious  
illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Ulcerative colitis forced her to have a colectomy and ileostomy  
14 years ago. Later, her gallbladder was removed. She suffers from 
brittle diabetes and autoimmune dysfunction and had a bout with 
Grave's disease. She had to give up tending the 500 rose bushes 
that flanked her office after a garden fungus produced an abscess 
in her head. 
</P>
<P>
	She bore it all with the same sense of humor that got her  
through residency -- shortsheeting dorm beds and wrapping a 
colleague's car in 21 rolls of aluminum foil. 
</P>
<P>
	A plaque on her kitchen wall says, ``Thou shalt not whine,'' and  
her ability to withstand pain and ``minor-league bleeding'' let her 
minimize a diagnosis of liver lesions 10 years ago. But the cancer 
was something she couldn't work off or joke away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't able to find a magic key to get around this one,''  
Rummel says. 
</P>
<P>
	Just one day home from the hospital, she began making calls,  
trying to find a new doctor for Colquitt. After a friend helped put 
a letter on the Internet, calls came from all over. But a stroke of 
fate allowed her to live to see her wish fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Ifekan-Shango Simon was looking to stay in Georgia after his  
residency in Columbus. A native of St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin 
Islands, he had approached Colquitt last October, but the town 
didn't need him then. 
</P>
<P>
	By February, Simon and his wife had decided to accept an offer  
in Alabama when he found Miller County's message on his answering 
machine. Colquitt not only needed him but was offering everything 
he wanted -- a family practice with a chance to deliver babies and 
do minor surgeries. He signed commitment papers last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone acknowledges Simon has big shoes to fill.  
</P>
<P>
	Long, the Head Start director, says Rummel often used her lunch  
break to screen the center's 40 children. Her eyes tear as she 
recalls how Rummel lay beside her in her hospital bed through eight 
hours of labor with her second child, Courtney, now 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``You won't find many doctors who'll do that,'' she says.  
</P>
<P>
	A pink flush rises in Rummel's jaundiced cheeks when she hears  
such talk. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just not that big a deal,'' she says. ``I think the town  
.... just needs to be groomed and protected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, someone else will have to do the protecting.  
</P>
<P>
	Sitting in the family room with her dachshund, Alexander the  
Great, and terrier, Cricket, Rummel rears back in sudden agony -- 
her fists clenched, her bare, swollen feet pointed in a minute-long 
spasm. She has postponed her morphine so her head would be clear 
for the interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoa, that was a hoot!'' she says.  
</P>
<P>
	Living on borrowed time, Rummel still seems more worried about  
those she leaves behind than herself. She had always planned to 
grow old in Colquitt -- and to keep contributing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I dread disability more than death,'' she says, wiping a tear  
from her nose. ``I can't think of anything worse than to be 
useless.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Crosses Re-Erected at Colorado School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The 13 crosses honoring the slain at  
Columbine High School are back. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the April 20 shootings, Greg Zanis built 15 wooden  
crosses in his Aurora, Ill., garage, drove to Littleton and put 
them on a hill overlooking the school. 
</P>
<P>
	A father of one of the 13 victims destroyed the crosses  
inscribed with the names of the gunmen, Eric Harris and Dylan 
Klebold. Zanis took the rest down to stem the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	But after receiving calls from Littleton residents, Zanis  
replaced the crosses of the victims Wednesday, vowing never to 
erect another for a murderer ``unless I know he's accepted the 
Lord.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, 18, and Klebold, 17, stormed Columbine with guns and  
bombs, killing 12 students and a teacher and wounding 23 others 
before committing suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Detectives have pursued a wider conspiracy, specifically  
checking to see whether there was a third gunman or others who 
helped plot the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, a 17-year-old student accused by Sheriff John  
Stone of withholding information about the massacre angrily 
criticized the sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have no evidence against me. They have nothing. Actually,  
I know that the FBI has said that I'm not a suspect. The DA has 
said that I'm not a suspect,'' Brooks Brown said in an interview 
outside his home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both have said I'm just a witness. I don't know why Sheriff  
(John) Stone is doing this. ... I just don't think he's thinking 
before he talks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In newspaper and national television show interviews, Stone has  
said he believes Brown knows more about the attack than he has told 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown's parents had earlier criticized Stone for failing to act  
after they told deputies last year that Harris had threatened their 
son and had written about bombs and murder on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, who reconciled with Harris after the threats, said Harris  
warned him to stay away from the school moments before the attack. 
Brown's brother was in the cafeteria during the rampage -- a fact 
Brown says proves his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown and his parents, Randall and Judy Brown, swept aside  
Stone's suspicions and said his comments stemmed from their 
criticism of his department. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis reiterated Wednesday that no one  
has been labeled a suspect, including Brooks Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said earlier this week they were leaning toward  
the theory that Harris and Klebold acted alone, but Stone said he 
believes there may have been a third gunman, based on interviews 
with student witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had a lot of witnesses tell us there was a third  
suspect and we've said that from day one,'' Davis said. ``But, from 
day one, we've said we hadn't had any concrete evidence to show 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stone, who has been deluged with interview requests since the  
attack, said he will scale back his public comment on the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Jefferson County Schools Superintendent Jane Hammond  
said the long-term costs of dealing with the shooting, including 
legal fees and tougher security at other schools could reach $50 
million.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Players Return Home Day Late </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Normally it's no big deal if you oversleep and  
miss your plane. But this week such an incident caused a ruffling 
of diplomatic feathers in the United States and Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	When more than 300 Cubans, including an all-star baseball team,  
took off from Baltimore-Washington International Airport Tuesday 
morning, six of their compatriots missed the flight, allegedly 
because they overslept. 
</P>
<P>
	The six are now back in Cuba, having assured U.S. immigration  
agents on Wednesday that they were eager to go back and were not 
would-be defectors. They arrived 24 hours late and missed the 
celebration in Havana of the Cuban team's 12-6 triumph over the 
Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	What troubled the Cuban side was that the immigration officials  
interviewed the Cubans without first communicating with Cuban 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Luis Fernandez, spokesman for the Cuban diplomatic mission here,  
said he first learned of the interviews when a reporter called to 
ask about them hours after the Jamaica Air jet departed. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez, who was at BWI for the departure of the flight, said  
it would be a ``provocation'' for the interviews to have taken 
place without prior communication with Cuban officials. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Cuba would find it ``offensive'' if the six were asked  
whether they were leaving voluntarily. It was not clear, he added, 
whether Cuba would lodge a protest with the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., said in a telephone interview it was  
entirely appropriate that Cuban officials were not notified in 
advance. He noted that Cuba is on a list of countries alleged by 
the State Department to be sponsors of terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	Menendez said the six were interviewed on the jetway before they  
boarded. He said the Immigration and Naturalization Service should 
have found a site more neutral than one where Cuban security agents 
who escorted the group to the airport were nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	All six answered ``no'' to the following questions: Were they  
leaving involuntarily, were they fearful of returning to Cuba and 
was their return forced by coercion, Menendez said. He added that 
he was skeptical about the Cuban claim that the six overslept. 
</P>
<P>
	State and Justice Department officials accept the Cuban  
explanation. 
</P>
<P>
	They are also in agreement with Cuba on another issue: Both  
sides will work to facilitate communications between Rigoberto 
Herrera, the Cuban pitching coach who defected Tuesday morning, and 
his family back in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Herrera, 54, turned up at a Baltimore police station Tuesday  
morning and asked for political asylum. Officials said they expect 
the request to be granted.

<HEADLINE> Veggie Libel Law Stays in Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The Texas House rejected an attempt  
Thursday to repeal the state's ``veggie libel'' law -- the law 
cattlemen used to sue television talk-show host Oprah Winfrey in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The repeal bill by Rep. Ruth Jones McClendon, a Democrat, was  
voted down 80-57. 
</P>
<P>
	While Ms. McClendon said the current law encouraged frivolous  
lawsuits and discouraged free speech, opponents said the law is 
needed to protect the state's agricultural industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Even dubbing it the ``veggie libel'' law trivializes a serious  
issue to agricultural producers, said Republican Rep. David 
Swinford. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes it sound silly. It's not silly,'' Swinford said.  
</P>
<P>
	The law allows producers to sue those who knowingly make false,  
disparaging statements about perishable agriculture products. 
</P>
<P>
	During an April 16, 1996 program on dangerous foods, Ms. Winfrey  
said England's bout with mad cow disease stopped her from eating 
another hamburger. Winfrey was quickly hit with a lawsuit that cost 
her up to $5 million to defend. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal jury ruled in Ms. Winfrey's favor.  
</P>
<P>
	Keeping the law will continue to have a chilling effect on free  
speech, said Republican Rep. Brian McCall. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't talk about broccoli without the fear that you'll  
have to defend yourself in a courtroom,'' McCall said.

<HEADLINE> 76er Iverson Claims Scoring Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Allen Iverson's friends had to drag him to a  
local nightspot to see if Shaquille O'Neal would catch him. If it 
had been a pickup game against Shaq, or anyone else, Iverson 
wouldn't have hesitated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody stay humble,'' Iverson told his friend, Que Gaskins,  
as they settled in at a restaurant just outside the city to watch 
Iverson's dream of an NBA scoring title become reality. 
</P>
<P>
	When Shaq fell short, there were cheers, champagne and even a  
few tears from Iverson, who became the 76ers' first scoring 
champion since Wilt Chamberlain in 1965-66. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've worked so hard,'' said Iverson, embracing his friends and  
family Wednesday night when O'Neal fell far short of the 40 points 
he needed to pass Iverson for the scoring lead. ``All my dreams are 
coming true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After scoring 33 points in the Sixers' 105-100 overtime victory  
over the Detroit Pistons Wednesday night, Iverson left the arena 
not knowing whether it was enough to capture his first scoring 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal, playing against Portland on the West Coast, scored 18  
points and lost the scoring race 26.75 to 26.31 in one of the 
closest battles in NBA history. O'Neal, who led the league in 
scoring in 1994-95, also lost by .44 points to David Robinson in 
1993-94. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been very selfish for me to try and get 40  
tonight,'' O'Neal said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first scoring title of the post-Michael Jordan era went to  
Iverson, a 6-foot speed demon who has been criticized for 
everything from his criminal record and fashion statements to his 
brief history of selfishness and perceived arrogance on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as he does when he drives fearlessly to the basket, Iverson  
stood up to all the giants who have led the NBA in scoring -- names 
like Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Jerry West and Elvin Hayes. 
He is the shortest scoring champion in NBA history, eclipsing the 
6-foot-1 Nate ``Tiny'' Archibald, who did it in 1972-73. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be a great for the league, a little kid  
winning the scoring championship,'' said Sixers coach Larry Brown, 
who had a one-on-one meeting with Iverson before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown wanted to prep Iverson for the night ahead, because he'd  
been through this before. Brown was the Denver coach when David 
Thompson went into the last game of the season in a tight scoring 
battle with San Antonio's George Gervin. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson scored 73 points for the Nuggets, only to watch Gervin  
go out later and pour in 63 to win the title by .07 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``David and I talked before the game, and we all wanted David to  
win the scoring title,'' Brown said. ``And he didn't want anybody 
to help him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just hoping that Allen would get the scoring title  
without us doing anything silly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson and Gaskins, who is in charge of Iverson's brand name at  
Reebok, quickly ducked out of practice when reporters arrived 
Thursday. Maybe he wanted to let the scoring title fade away and 
focus on a more important matter -- his first trip to the playoffs 
and the Sixers' first since 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia clinched the sixth seed in the East with the  
victory and plays Orlando in the first rounding beginning Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows my agenda,'' team president Pat Croce said of  
Iverson. ``Get me a ring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the closing seconds of the game, Iverson passed up one final,  
stat-padding shot, choosing instead to dribble out the clock. He 
did it in style, laughing and high-stepping around like a kid on a 
playground. 
</P>
<P>
	As a rookie, or even last year, Iverson almost certainly would  
have heaved the ball toward the rim. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only my third year,'' Iverson said. ``I think the problem  
with me coming in was that people looked at my talents and they 
didn't want to let me grow as a basketball player and as a person. 
I think over time, maybe people will start to understand me and 
some of the critics will back off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, among his close circle of friends, Iverson had no trouble  
letting his emotions go. 
</P>
<P>
	``He got pretty teary-eyed, hugging everybody,'' Gaskins said.  
``He was just thanking all the people that were close to him and 
stuck by him and really believed in him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to embrace for at least five minutes. It was just one  
of those unforgettable moments, one of those moments I'll never 
forget. I'm just glad I was there.''

<HEADLINE> Deadly Storms Strike Tennessee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINDEN, Tenn. (AP) -- A line of powerful storms blew through  
western Tennessee, destroying homes, closing schools and damaging 
buildings in 30 counties. At least four people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Funnel clouds were reported in eight counties Wednesday night,  
but there were no confirmed tornado touchdowns, Tennessee Emergency 
Management Agency spokesman Kurt Pickering said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three people were killed in the town of Linden, about 70 miles  
southwest of Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollis Hinson, a Perry County trustee, and his friend Patti  
Haston, a schoolteacher from nearby Lobelville, were killed when 
high winds destroyed Hinson's house. 
</P>
<P>
	A frantic overnight search for 14-year-old Brandi Mathis ended  
when she was found in the rubble of her three-story home this 
morning. She died on arrival at a hospital. Her parents and brother 
escaped injury, as did her grandparents, whose home next door also 
was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	The deaths stunned the town of 1,300.  
</P>
<P>
	``A town like Linden is so small that when someone dies everyone  
grieves,'' said Gail Moore, the town recorder. 
</P>
<P>
	In Madison County, where tornadoes killed six people in January,  
a man died when his car hit a tree that had fallen across a 
highway. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third straight night that deadly storms had struck in  
the Plains and South. More than 40 people were killed earlier this 
week in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	In North Carolina, high winds downed trees and closed the high  
school in Asheville today. A tornado was spotted 14 miles south of 
Burnsville, but the National Weather Service received no reports of 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Severe thunderstorms moved across north Georgia today, knocking  
out power to about 10,000 in the Atlanta area and dumping hail and 
heavy rain on some areas. A tornado was spotted on radar in 
Gwinnett County, northeast of Atlanta, but there were no immediate 
reports of damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Nashville International Airport was closed for a time because of  
winds topping 90 mph. Spokeswoman Celeste Stein said two people and 
a police officer suffered minor injuries because of flying debris 
and about 70 of 255 private planes kept in airport hangars were 
damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	About 150 passengers were stranded and spent the night in the  
terminal. Airport workers supplied pillows and blankets for them. 
</P>
<P>
	Pickering said most of the counties reported scattered power  
outages, downed trees and roofs blown off houses and some 
buildings. Near Nashville, eight campers at a trailer park were 
overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 11 people were taken to Nashville hospitals with minor  
injuries, said Jim Thacker, the city's director of emergency 
management. A least 50,000 customers were without power today in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Nashville schools were closed today, as were those in many of  
the other 29 counties that suffered damage.

<HEADLINE> Puerto Rico Seeks More U.S. Input </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Puerto Rican leaders faulted Congress Thursday  
for failing to lay out a road map for the territory's future. 
Senators shot back that some Puerto Ricans are seeking a ``free 
lunch'' status giving them the benefits but not the 
responsibilities of federal union. 
</P>
<P>
	In a packed hearing of the Senate Energy Committee, Puerto Rican  
Gov. Pedro Rossello said a plebiscite last December on Puerto 
Rico's future proved inconclusive in part because Congress has yet 
to define the options -- from statehood to independence -- that are 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	``After 100 years of waiting, we would expect Congress to act on  
its responsibilities,'' said Rossello, who supports statehood. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year the House passed, by a single vote, a bill authorizing  
a Puerto Rico statehood referendum. When the Senate failed to move 
on the legislation, the island went ahead with its own plebiscite 
in which 46 percent supported statehood but a majority 50.3 percent 
cast ballots for a ``none of the above'' option. The rest voted for 
independence or free association. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current commonwealth arrangement, the 3.8 million  
residents of Puerto Rico are U.S. citizens and the island receives 
more than $10 billion a year in federal funds. Puerto Ricans, 
however, pay no federal taxes and cannot vote for president. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of an enhanced commonwealth status under which Puerto  
Ricans would receive more political and economic independence 
claimed that most of the ``none of the above'' voters backed their 
position, which was not on the ballot. ``The people of Puerto Rico 
were unambiguous in their rejection of statehood,'' said Anibal 
Acevedo Vila, president of the Popular Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Others said the protest vote was associated more with other  
frustrations with the system. Ruben Berrios Martinez, president of 
the Puerto Rican Independence Party, said that for the past decade 
``Congress has repeatedly failed to authorize a federally sponsored 
referendum, even when all Puerto Rican political parties have 
unanimously endorsed such a petition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prospects for congressional action this year are slim, with  
little enthusiasm about promoting statehood for an island that is 
Spanish-speaking, poorer than the other 50 states and -- to the 
disadvantage of Republicans -- would probably send Democrats to 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Craig Thomas, R-Wyo., in a heated exchange with Rossello,  
complained that ``you constantly come here and shift the blame to 
the Congress. ... I'm getting a little impatient with it always 
being our responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., also grilled Acevedo Vila about the  
commonwealth option, demanding that his party put in writing its 
stance on such issues as allowing Puerto Rico to enter trade 
agreements with other countries or override acts of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who would have Puerto Ricans keep their U.S. citizenship  
and income tax-free access to federal funding while giving them 
economic sovereignty are offering a ``false choice because there 
are no free lunches,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., called it the ``free beer and  
barbecue option.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Puerto Rican speakers also used the hearing to protest an  
incident last month where one man was killed and four injured 
during U.S. Navy live ammunition firing on the island of Vieques.

<HEADLINE> Crude Tumbles on Shell's Pessimism  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil futures tumbled 3.5 percent Thursday on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange after executives from the world's largest oil 
company expressed doubts about producers' ability to maintain 
output cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, palladium futures soared, boosting other  
metals, while coffee retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude fell sharply, threatening at one point to go below $18 a  
barrel, after Royal Dutch-Shell Group indicated in its 
first-quarter earnings report that a 52 percent jump in prices this 
year may lead to quota-busting among the world's larger producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting  
Countries and other key producers, including Mexico and Norway, 
have agreed to cut output 2.1 million barrels, on top of 3 million 
barrels they agreed to take off the market last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices have jumped amid indications the cuts are being made, but  
analysts and others have warned that OPEC does not have a history 
of lasting cohesiveness. Many members in the past have exported 
beyond their stated targets since most oil-rich countries rely on 
those revenues for domestic spending needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Production discipline may be difficult to maintain if prices  
do rise, and a new phase of price weakness could be triggered,'' 
Shell said in its earnings statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy futures also were pressured by news the Group of Seven  
industrialized nations and Russia had agreed on a framework for 
peace in Yugoslavia after a heavy NATO bombing campaign. If a final 
deal is reached, demand for jet fuel could fall sharply, analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Light, sweet crude for June delivery fell 66 cents to $18.32 a  
barrel; June unleaded gasoline fell 1.81 cents to 54.44 cents a 
gallon; June heating oil fell 1.57 cents to 44.22 cents a gallon; 
June natural gas fell 6.4 cents to $2.295 for each 1,000 cubic 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent Blend crude oil for delivery in June  
fell 49 cents to $16.56 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	Palladium futures soared on the New York Mercantile Exchange  
after Japanese buyers returned from a long holiday to snap up 
available supplies for use in automobile emission-control devices, 
jewelry and electronics. 
</P>
<P>
	While Russia, the world's largest producer of the metal, has  
begun selling large supplies to get desperately need currency, 
there are no major contracts set with Western buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	June palladium rose $19.25 to $313.45 an ounce. The sharp gains  
also prompted options-related buying in other metals markets. 
August gold rose $2.20 to $292.50 an ounce. October platinum rose 
$4.60 to $358.50 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures fell on the Board of Trade of the City of New  
York after respected crop forecaster Leon Yallouz predicted 
Brazil's crop will be larger than previously expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Yallouz' private report issued to client predicted the nation's  
largest coffee grower will have a harvest of between 25.2 million 
bags and 26.4 million bags -- figures about 4 percent higher than 
his previous estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	The large harvest would be the second consecutive year of  
plentiful supplies from Brazil. And while its crop is the robusta 
bean not favored by gourmet coffee drinkers, the beans often are 
mixed into blends. 
</P>
<P>
	July arabica coffee fell .45 cent to $1.032 a pound.

<HEADLINE> Flight Recorder Panel To Be Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The heads of the National Transportation  
Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration said Wednesday 
they will sponsor a committee to examine how new flight data 
technology can improve aviation safety in the 21st century. 
</P>
<P>
	At an NTSB symposium on transportation recorders, board Chairman  
Jim Hall and FAA Administrator Jane Garvey said they are asking a 
group of experts from industry and the government to form the 
Future Flight Data Committee. The panel will look ahead to 2015 and 
beyond to see how new technologies can be used to collect and use 
flight data. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee will draw members from U.S. and international  
safety boards, manufacturers, flight crew organizations and 
regulatory agencies. The group will be asked to submit a final 
report by next spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chairman Hall and I believe it is time to thoughtfully and  
thoroughly examine the role, the technology and the true potential 
of flight information,'' Garvey said in a statement. ``We look 
forward to what the committee experts will tell us about the future 
of flight-data collection.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Crude Tumbles on Shell's Pessimism  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil futures tumbled 3.5 percent Thursday on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange after executives from the world's largest oil 
company expressed doubts about producers' ability to maintain 
output cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, palladium futures soared, boosting other  
metals, while coffee retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude fell sharply, threatening at one point to go below $18 a  
barrel, after Royal Dutch-Shell Group indicated in its 
first-quarter earnings report that a 52 percent jump in prices this 
year may lead to quota-busting among the world's larger producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting  
Countries and other key producers, including Mexico and Norway, 
have agreed to cut output 2.1 million barrels, on top of 3 million 
barrels they agreed to take off the market last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices have jumped amid indications the cuts are being made, but  
analysts and others have warned that OPEC does not have a history 
of lasting cohesiveness. Many members in the past have exported 
beyond their stated targets since most oil-rich countries rely on 
those revenues for domestic spending needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Production discipline may be difficult to maintain if prices  
do rise, and a new phase of price weakness could be triggered,'' 
Shell said in its earnings statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy futures also were pressured by news the Group of Seven  
industrialized nations and Russia had agreed on a framework for 
peace in Yugoslavia after a heavy NATO bombing campaign. If a final 
deal is reached, demand for jet fuel could fall sharply, analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Light, sweet crude for June delivery fell 66 cents to $18.32 a  
barrel; June unleaded gasoline fell 1.81 cents to 54.44 cents a 
gallon; June heating oil fell 1.57 cents to 44.22 cents a gallon; 
June natural gas fell 6.4 cents to $2.295 for each 1,000 cubic 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent Blend crude oil for delivery in June  
fell 49 cents to $16.56 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	Palladium futures soared on the New York Mercantile Exchange  
after Japanese buyers returned from a long holiday to snap up 
available supplies for use in automobile emission-control devices, 
jewelry and electronics. 
</P>
<P>
	While Russia, the world's largest producer of the metal, has  
begun selling large supplies to get desperately need currency, 
there are no major contracts set with Western buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	June palladium rose $19.25 to $313.45 an ounce. The sharp gains  
also prompted options-related buying in other metals markets. 
August gold rose $2.20 to $292.50 an ounce. October platinum rose 
$4.60 to $358.50 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures fell on the Board of Trade of the City of New  
York after respected crop forecaster Leon Yallouz predicted 
Brazil's crop will be larger than previously expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Yallouz' private report issued to client predicted the nation's  
largest coffee grower will have a harvest of between 25.2 million 
bags and 26.4 million bags -- figures about 4 percent higher than 
his previous estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	The large harvest would be the second consecutive year of  
plentiful supplies from Brazil. And while its crop is the robusta 
bean not favored by gourmet coffee drinkers, the beans often are 
mixed into blends. 
</P>
<P>
	July arabica coffee fell .45 cent to $1.032 a pound.

<HEADLINE> Giants' Hamilton Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LEE, N.J. (AP) -- New York Giants defensive tackle Keith  
Hamilton pleaded guilty Thursday to driving while intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton was arrested on the George Washington Bridge in  
November after police said they clocked him traveling at 71 mph in 
an area where the speed limit is 45 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	A municipal court judge allowed Hamilton to avoid jail time on  
criminal charges of possession of marijuana, possession of drug 
paraphernalia, and being under the influence of cocaine, said 
municipal prosecutor Matthew Fierro. 
</P>
<P>
	He was ordered to pay about $2,000 in fines, and his driver's  
license was suspended for six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of serving jail time, Hamilton was allowed to enroll in  
the municipal equivalent of a pre-trial intervention program, under 
which he entered no plea to the criminal charges and agreed to 
undergo a drug test immediately and a second drug test in six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	If Hamilton tests negative for drugs both times, and if he is  
not arrested again during the next six months, the charges will be 
dismissed, Fierro said. 
</P>
<P>
	Giants officials have said it was unlikely that Hamilton, a  
starter, would face suspension, because it is his first drug 
offense. A DWI often results in a half-game fine up to $20,000, the 
team said.

<HEADLINE> FCC Probes Mass Faxing of Gun Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators are investigating whether a  
British company illegally faxed a gun control survey to individuals 
and businesses that didn't request it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission is reviewing the matter to  
determine whether the company, 21st Century Fax Ltd., violated a 
U.S. law that bars unsolicited faxes that contain advertisements to 
businesses and residences, said Dorothy Attwood, chief of the 
Common Carrier Bureau's enforcement division. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC has received about 25 complaints specifically on the  
matter, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company faxed out a survey seeking people's views on whether  
more effective gun control is needed and asked that their answers 
be faxed back to a 900 telephone number for a $2.95 a minute 
charge, with most of the money going to 21st Century Fax Ltd., 
Attwood said. She indicated that this appears to fit the definition 
of an advertisement. 
</P>
<P>
	The fax was sent out shortly after the Columbine High School  
shootings in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Attwood said the fax may have been sent out to as many as 3  
million machines. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC is also looking to determine the extent to which people  
and companies received the fax but didn't request it. 
</P>
<P>
	If the FCC determines a violation of the law occurred, it could  
fine the London-based company or impose other penalties. The FCC is 
not sure when it will issue a decision in the matter, Attwood said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission also is looking into whether the  
company violated its rules pertaining to the billing of 900 
telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The company could not immediately be reached.  
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post, in Wednesday editions, reported that 21st  
Century Fax's director Gordon Ritchie said the company did not 
violate the law. The FCC's rules ``only apply to unsolicited faxes 
to the U.S.,'' the Post quoted Ritchie as saying.

<HEADLINE> Lawsuit Over Atlanta Olympic Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The group that initiated Atlanta's bid for the  
1996 Olympics is suing to stop the state from forcing it to open 
thousands of additional boxes of records to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	The Georgia Amateur Athletic Foundation filed suit late  
Wednesday after receiving a letter from Georgia Attorney General 
Thurbert Baker, who threatened legal action if the additional files 
were not opened. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation opened nine boxes of documents last week.  
</P>
<P>
	Baker's letter said the files should be made public because of  
the ``overwhelmingly public nature of the 1996 Olympics (and) the 
inextricable link between private interests and government entities 
in the pursuit'' of the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Roy Barnes already has said the records should be opened.  
</P>
<P>
	The foundation's suit asked the court to preserve ``the  
established rights to privacy of the foundation's donors, 
volunteers and staff,'' said Lee Echols, a spokesman for the 
foundation, which Billy Payne created in 1987 to begin Atlanta's 
Olympic bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation has been embroiled in a legal dispute with The  
Atlanta Journal-Constitution over the records related to Atlanta's 
bid for the 1996 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker helped strike a deal between the newspaper and the  
foundation that he says was intended to open all records, without 
litigation, except those that would be exempted under the Open 
Records Act. 
</P>
<P>
	But Baker said records were withheld for privacy reasons with no  
explanation of what those papers contained. He also said such 
records could not be withheld entirely -- they could only be 
redacted to remove private information. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker also said he understood archivists were deciding which  
papers to withhold instead of the foundation's lawyers. He said 
such decisions are legal ones and should be handled by attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker said if the terms of his letter are not agreed to by  
Friday, ``I will initiate litigation'' to determine if the records 
should be opened. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked later about the foundation's suit, Baker said, ``If they  
want to litigate this in court, we'll litigate this in court.''

<HEADLINE> Grizzlies' Worst Season Finally Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- For a franchise that has seen  
it's share of lows in its short four-year existence, the Vancouver 
Grizzlies out-did themselves this season. 
</P>
<P>
	They were the worst. The worst in the NBA with an 8-42 record.  
Their won-loss percentage of .160 was the worst in franchise 
history. And they lost a league-worst 24 road games, including 
their last 23 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	How bad was this season? Three of their wins came against the  
Los Angeles Clippers, the NBA's second-worst team. On the other 
hand, they were a mere 3-24 against plus-.500 teams, with their 
biggest win coming against the Los Angeles Lakers, which was the 
last game for Lakers coach Del Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grizzlies suffered through a 13-game losing streak and lose  
seven in a row to end the season. Their 87-84 loss at home to 
Denver on April 7, marked the Nuggets' first road win in 25 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have mixed emotions about it. It was a very trying season,''  
said Grizzlies coach Brian Hill, who is 27-113 in two seasons with 
Vancouver. ``You're probably happy that it's over, because you 
don't want to see your team going through that anymore. And yet at 
the same time you want to immediately get started to rectify the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody needs to step back away from it.''  
</P>
<P>
	When Shareef Abdur-Rahim was asked if he was happy to get this  
season out of the way, he said, ``Yeah, you kind of want to get the 
misery over with. ... The kind of season we had, I don't think 
there's anything encouraging about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abdur-Rahim, who entered this year signing a six-year contract  
extension, had a 23-points per game average, fourth best in the 
league. The only other bright spot was the play of rookie Mike 
Bibby, who stepped into the starting point guard role and finished 
averaging 13.2 points a game and 6.5 assists, 13th in the league, 
and tops among first-year players. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grizzlies were behind the eight-ball from the start when  
center Bryant Reeves reported to camp about 40 pounds overweight, 
and they then lost veteran point guard Lee Mayberry (ankle surgery) 
who missed all but nine games this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves' troubles didn't end. He started the season coming off  
the bench. By the time he got in game-shape, he suffered a 
season-ending knee injury and missed the last 25 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Down the stretch, the Grizzlies were forced to go with a  
starting lineup that featured journeyman Tony Massenburg at center, 
and two rookies -- Bibby and Felipe Lopez -- in the backcourt. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grizzlies, who's all-time record stands at 56-240, will now  
have their first shot at getting the No. 1 pick in this June's 
draft. Under the expansion rules introduced when they entered the 
NBA, the Grizzlies and fellow expansion Toronto Raptors were barred 
from getting the top pick in their first three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Grizzlies president and general manager Stu Jackson isn't sure  
what he will do with the pick, considering he has expressed a 
desire to add veteran experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to be under enormous pressure to really trade that  
pick and really do the whirly-bird,'' Jackson said. ``But at the 
same time, we could have in front of us potentially an NBA All-Star 
of the future, which is ultimately the way you gain ground in this 
league. So it's going to be a tough dilemma.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, in the fourth year of his five-year contract, remained  
optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``A fan wrote me something the other day that I'll share with  
you. They wrote, `Gold has to undergo through some intense heat 
before it becomes a true metal.' And maybe this is the time when 
we're going through a little of that heat before we realize what it 
is we have,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how much more heat the team can take, Jackson said, ``I'm  
not a magician or a mind-reader. I don't have a crystal ball. I'll 
just leave it at that.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Criticizes Clinton on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Republican presidential prospect George W.  
Bush said Thursday that the United States must ``ferociously'' seek 
victory in Yugoslavia, and criticized President Clinton for his 
decision ruling out the use of ground troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it said, `We're coming to fight you with one hand',''  
the early GOP front-runner said in an interview with The Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The standoff with Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic has become  
an early touchstone of the 2000 presidential race, with a large 
field of GOP candidates trying to stake out positions on the 
headline-grabbing conflict. Arizona Sen. John McCain drew attention 
to his campaign by being the first to criticize Clinton for ruling 
out ground troops. Rep. John Kasich of Ohio urged mediation. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush first moved cautiously to react to the crisis, but  
eventually said he supported the mission and questioned Clinton's 
decision to rule out ground troops. Sitting in his office at the 
pink granite capitol building Thursday, the Texas governor offered 
what may be his most detailed and critical assessment of the 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke as the United States, its Western allies and Russia  
agreed on the outlines of a peace formula for Kosovo. Moscow 
endorsed deployment of an international security force to oversee 
the peaceful return of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, son of the president who formed the Persian Gulf War  
coalition, said Clinton failed to clearly define the mission early 
on and questioned whether he has followed the exit-strategy 
doctrine established by President Bush and Gen. Colin Powell, then 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any commander-in-chief has got to understand the true  
principles of the Powell Doctrine, which are: What are the 
objectives? How do you achieve the objective? And how do you 
end?,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers are ``frustrated and concerned'' about the mission and  
those issues, he said, and that explains why a divided House failed 
to support the U.S.-led NATO mission in votes last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Congress is sending some mixed signals and I think there  
appears to be concerns by congressional leaders as to mission, 
objectives and the exit strategy,'' Bush said. ``I happen to think 
it's important for Milosevic to hear one voice, and that we're 
serious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said he would have voted to support the mission if he had  
been in Congress, if only to send a signal that the United States 
stands united behind its troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to have one objective in mind and that is to achieve  
the goals and to do so ferociously,'' Bush said. Like Clinton, he 
says the goals are to remove the Serbs from Kosovo, return the 
ethnic Albanians to their homes and insert a peacekeeping force. 
``It's important that NATO be involved'' with the peacekeeping 
effort, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an awesome responsibility to be commander-in-chief ...  
but the commander-in-chief has a responsibility, once the troops 
are committed, to win. To win,'' he said, putting added emphasis on 
the final two words. ``Once people's lives are at risk, once a 
decision has been made, then the plans have to be such as to 
minimize the loss by force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Has Clinton done that?  
</P>
<P>
	``Time will tell,'' Bush said. ``I thought saying right off the  
bat that we won't use land troops was a mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was pleased that Jesse Jackson gained the release of  
three American POWs, including two with ties to Texas. But he 
suggested that Milosevic used the mission to undermine U.S. 
resolve. ``Mr. Milosevic (is) a public relations master,'' Bush 
said. ``The fact that he's on CNN smiling with these POWs should 
not lessen the resolve of the United States.''

<HEADLINE> Lockheed Leads Satellite Venture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lockheed Martin is leading a $3.6 billion  
satellite venture that will beam high-speed, high-capacity Internet 
and multimedia services to customers with small satellite dishes. 
</P>
<P>
	The joint venture with TRW and Telecom Italia, named Astrolink,  
plans to launch the first of four satellites in 2002, providing 
service in Europe and North and South America beginning in 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	The next three satellites are to be launched at six-month  
intervals, expanding the network worldwide, the companies said in a 
press release Thursday. Another five satellites may be added to the 
system, depending on market demand. 
</P>
<P>
	The initiative by Lockheed, the big aerospace contractor based  
in Bethesda, Md., follows a similar project started by Hughes 
Electronics, a unit of General Motors Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Astrolink has been given initial $900 million in funding, with  
Lockheed Martin providing $400 million, and TRW and Telecom Italia 
providing $250 million apiece. Each company will hold a minority 
stake in the venture. 
</P>
<P>
	The system will carry high-speed data traffic for Internet,  
multimedia and corporate networks, the statement said, noting a 
forecast that the global market for broadband communications will 
grow to nearly $200 billion by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, by the consulting firm Booz-Allen &AMP; Hamilton, also  
predicted that space-based systems will capture 10-15 percent of 
that market. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite system would be differentiated from leased-line  
systems in that customers would pay only for the connection time 
and data transmission services they use, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	Celso Azevedo, a former executive for the satellite television  
service DirecTV, has been named president and chief executive of 
Astrolink. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have taken the lead in the race to deploy the first of a  
new generation of flexible, reliable, high speed, global wireless 
data services,'' said Azevedo. ``We are in active discussions with 
additional investors and service providers, and we plan to announce 
agreements with them in the near future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin will provide Astrolink's spacecraft, systems  
integration and launch services, with Lockheed Martin Global 
Telecommunications acting as one of Astrolink's service providers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland-based TRW will build the digital communications  
payloads for the satellites, and will have the opportunity to be an 
Astrolink service provider. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia will supply the worldwide ground systems for the  
venture and manage the satellite and network control systems. 
Telecom Italia will sell Astrolink services in Italy and through 
its affiliated companies in Europe and Latin America.

<HEADLINE> Owners Say Royals Group Too Big </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Major league owners will not approve  
Miles Prentice's proposed $75 million bid to buy the Kansas City 
Royals because his group has too many investors, a high-ranking 
baseball official told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Prentice, a New York lawyer who has pursued the team for almost  
two years, will be asked to reform his group with fewer investors, 
the official said, speaking on the condition he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	The Prentice group numbers between 40 and 50 and includes some  
of Kansas City's most prominent families as well as some of its 
most famous citizens, including golfer Tom Watson and Negro Leagues 
baseball star Buck O'Neil. 
</P>
<P>
	The official said it is highly unlikely the issue will be put to  
a vote when owners meet in Pittsburgh on June 9-10. Baseball has 
expressed a preference for smaller ownership groups, claiming 
larger partnerships are unwieldy and difficult to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Herman, the president of the Royals who has led the effort  
to find a new owner, said neither he nor Prentice has been notified 
of baseball's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Am I confident baseball will move in an expedient way? I hope  
they will. We're doing everything we can,'' Herman told radio 
station KMBZ, the Royals' flagship station. 
</P>
<P>
	And Prentice, during a news conference Thursday night, said he  
remained optimistic that the sale would be approved. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am thankful and proud to be part of this group,'' he said.  
``This group includes two women ... we will be the first ownership 
group with two African-American members, and we have a 
Japanese-American. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the long run, the size of our group and the composition of  
our group, will be the strength of our group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prentice also said he had not heard any previous indications  
that his group would not be approved in its current form. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not been an issue,'' he said. ``I've talked to four or  
five different owners, and it's not been an issue with anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prentice was given approval by the Royals board of directors  
last November after meeting the board's minimum price of $75 
million. He also fulfilled the board's late demand that more than 
50 percent of the money be raised in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the one reason for his group's size is the board's  
insistence that more than half the money be raised locally. 
</P>
<P>
	``From day one, we've believed in the integrity of the  
process,'' Prentice said. ``The Royals' board made a decision. They 
wanted 50 percent of the equity to be from Kansas City, and we had 
to do certain things to satisfy the board requirements. The board 
made a decision and carefully considered that our group had not 
only the best fitness but was the best for Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the owners will use the same considered judgment and  
come to a decision that supports what the Royals board has 
recommended.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Bud Selig did not immediately return a telephone  
call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Royals have been in ownership limbo since the death in 1993  
of founder Ewing Kauffman, who willed the franchise to a charitable 
trust that eventually will receive all proceeds of the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	The board, worried that the money-losing Royals might eventually  
leave Kansas City, approved Prentice's bid only after failing to 
interest any local buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two other groups took part in the bidding process, and  
several sources, also speaking on the condition of anonymity, said 
neither came close to the $75 million figure. One was headed by 
former Royals star George Brett -- a team vice president -- and the 
other was a partnership between Lamar Hunt, owner of the Kansas 
City Chiefs, and Western Resources Inc., a local utility giant.

	Prentice declined to say exactly how many investors his group  
contains, or what the minimum investment was.

	``We required seven figures,'' he said. ``I'm not permitted even  
to discuss some of this stuff with my owners until major league 
baseball approves.''

<HEADLINE> University Ends Psychosis Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The University of Cincinnati has dropped  
psychiatric studies in which patients were given a chemical that 
may cause psychosis. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement Wednesday comes as federal investigators are  
examining research practices at the university and Cincinnati's 
Veterans Administration Medical Center, which are affiliated. 
</P>
<P>
	The university's study that raised concern was a 1997 clinical  
trial in which 13 patients who were delusional or hallucinating 
were asked to take amphetamines, which can make the symptoms worse. 
Giving people chemicals that may induce psychosis -- a severe form 
of mental illness -- was intended to help researchers learn how 
psychosis happens, or to test a treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics complained that people with psychoses severe enough to  
be hospitalized were denied treatment for their illnesses for five 
days just to complete the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Randy Hillard, head of the university's department of  
psychiatry, said the amphetamine study was conducted with adequate 
safety measures. But he said that no more of those studies will be 
done by his department until critics are satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nationwide, there is enough of a question ... that we will  
stop doing them until there is a consensus about how they should be 
done,'' Hillard said. 
</P>
<P>
	He commented after meeting Wednesday with four Cincinnati-area  
advocates for the mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, a presidential advisory commission recommended  
increased protections for people with mental disorders involved in 
research, including giving family and friends more say in what 
happens. The National Bioethics Advisory Commission proposed new 
federal guidelines to try to ensure that people with disorders such 
as dementia, schizophrenia and delirium are not exploited.

</P>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Gordon Allan ``Jack'' Aulis, a North  
Carolina journalist who worked in radio, television and newspapers, 
died Tuesday of a heart attack. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	Aulis wrote a column for The News &AMP; Observer of Raleigh in the  
1970s, hosted a state public television news program and wrote 
several nature books. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the Marine Corps at age 17 during World War II and  
lost his right arm during the Battle of Iwo Jima. 
</P>
<P>
	Entering journalism in 1951, Aulis worked for The Daily Advance  
in Elizabeth City, radio station WGAI in Elizabeth City, and The 
Virginian-Pilot in Norfolk, Va. before going to The News &AMP; Observer 
in 1968. 
</P>

<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Robert P. Bergman, director of the Cleveland  
Museum of Art since 1993, died Thursday of a rare blood disorder. 
He was 53. 
</P>
<P>
	During his tenure in Cleveland, the museum hosted three of its  
five highest-attended exhibitions, Egyptian art from the Louvre, 
Renaissance and Baroque art from the Vatican and Faberge items from 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	Annual attendance grew from about 450,000 to 650,000 during his  
tenure. He oversaw the renovation or reinstallation of 30 of 70 
galleries. 
</P>
<P>
	Before coming to Cleveland, Bergman served as director of the  
Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore from 1981-93. 
</P>
<P>
	Bergman taught at Princeton, Harvard University and Lincoln  
University in Oxford, Pa.

<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Carlos Fuentes Lemus, a photographer and the  
son of Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes, died Wednesday. He was 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuentes Lemus' body was found at a hotel in the Pacific coast  
resort of Puerto Vallarta, and prosecutors said the cause of death 
was apparent complications from hemophilia. 
</P>
<P>
	In June 1998, Fuentes Lemus published the book ``Portraits in  
Time,'' (``Retratos en el Tiempo'') in which his photographs of 
artists were accompanied by his father's profiles.

</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Maj. John Howard, a D-Day commander whose troops  
flew silently into occupied France in gliders to seize a vital 
bridge at the start of the Allied invasion, died Wednesday. He was 
86. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard's 180 infantrymen, the first Allied forces into Normandy,  
took the Germans by surprise in the early hours of June 6, 1944, 
and seized Pegasus Bridge. They held on until they were relieved 
later that day by troops making their way inland from the invasion 
beachheads. 
</P>
<P>
	The story of Pegasus Bridge and Howard's Oxford and  
Buckinghamshire Light Infantry was part of the 1962 D-Day movie 
``The Longest Day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Howard was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for  
gallantry, Britain's second-highest military honor, and France's 
Croix de Guerre with Palm. 
</P>
<P>
	He retired from the army in 1945 and went into agricultural  
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The major's achievements are commemorated in Normandy by a  
bronze bust, which marks the spot where the gliders landed near 
Ouistreham.

</P>
<P>
	PLANO, Texas (AP) -- Football star Mark Tuinei, who helped lead  
the Dallas Cowboys to three Super Bowl championships during his 
15-year career, died Thursday after a friend found him unconscious 
in his car outside his home. He was 39. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of death was not immediately known. Foul play, alcohol  
or drugs were not believed to be involved, and Tuinei was not known 
to have had a life-threatening medical condition, Police Chief 
Bruce Glasscock said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-5, 320-pound Tuinei came to the Cowboys in 1983 as a  
free agent from Hawaii and made the team as a defensive lineman. He 
switched to offense in 1985, settling in at the crucial position of 
left tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	His protection of quarterback Troy Aikman and his run-blocking  
for running back Emmitt Smith were big reasons the Cowboys went 
from 1-15 in 1989 to Super Bowl champions in 1993, 1994 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuinei played in the Pro Bowl after the 1994 and 1995 seasons.  
Knee problems ended his career after the 1997 season.

                             *Stan Wood    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Stan Wood, whose University of Southern  
California golf teams played in 22 NCAA championships in his 25 
years as coach, died Monday of a heart attack. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of his players at Southern Cal won major titles as  
professionals, including PGA champions Al Geiberger and Dave 
Stockton; Masters champion Craig Stadler; and U.S. Open champion 
Scott Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
	In his 25 years at USC, Wood's teams won 14 conference  
championships and had a dual meet record of 462-37. He also helped 
create the Golf Coaches Association of America and served as 
chairman of the NCAA Golf Committee from 1965 to 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood attended Southern Cal and worked for the Los Angeles Mirror  
as a golf writer before returning to coach at his alma mater. He 
became head coach in 1955 and retired in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood is survived by his wife Marianne and two stepsons.

<HEADLINE> 76er Iverson Claims Scoring Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Allen Iverson's friends had to drag him to a  
local nightspot to see if Shaquille O'Neal would catch him. If it 
had been a pickup game against Shaq, or anyone else, Iverson 
wouldn't have hesitated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody stay humble,'' Iverson told his friend, Que Gaskins,  
as they settled in at a restaurant just outside the city to watch 
Iverson's dream of an NBA scoring title become reality. 
</P>
<P>
	When Shaq fell short, there were cheers, champagne and even a  
few tears from Iverson, who became the 76ers' first scoring 
champion since Wilt Chamberlain in 1965-66. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've worked so hard,'' said Iverson, embracing his friends and  
family Wednesday night when O'Neal fell far short of the 40 points 
he needed to pass Iverson for the scoring lead. ``All my dreams are 
coming true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After scoring 33 points in the Sixers' 105-100 overtime victory  
over the Detroit Pistons Wednesday night, Iverson left the arena 
not knowing whether it was enough to capture his first scoring 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal, playing against Portland on the West Coast, scored 18  
points and lost the scoring race 26.75 to 26.31 in one of the 
closest battles in NBA history. O'Neal, who led the league in 
scoring in 1994-95, also lost by .44 points to David Robinson in 
1993-94. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been very selfish for me to try and get 40  
tonight,'' O'Neal said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first scoring title of the post-Michael Jordan era went to  
Iverson, a 6-foot speed demon who has been criticized for 
everything from his criminal record and fashion statements to his 
brief history of selfishness and perceived arrogance on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as he does when he drives fearlessly to the basket, Iverson  
stood up to all the giants who have led the NBA in scoring -- names 
like Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Jerry West and Elvin Hayes. 
He is the shortest scoring champion in NBA history, eclipsing the 
6-foot-1 Nate ``Tiny'' Archibald, who did it in 1972-73. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be a great for the league, a little kid  
winning the scoring championship,'' said Sixers coach Larry Brown, 
who had a one-on-one meeting with Iverson before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown wanted to prep Iverson for the night ahead, because he'd  
been through this before. Brown was the Denver coach when David 
Thompson went into the last game of the season in a tight scoring 
battle with San Antonio's George Gervin. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson scored 73 points for the Nuggets, only to watch Gervin  
go out later and pour in 63 to win the title by .07 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``David and I talked before the game, and we all wanted David to  
win the scoring title,'' Brown said. ``And he didn't want anybody 
to help him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just hoping that Allen would get the scoring title  
without us doing anything silly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson and Gaskins, who is in charge of Iverson's brand name at  
Reebok, quickly ducked out of practice when reporters arrived 
Thursday. Maybe he wanted to let the scoring title fade away and 
focus on a more important matter -- his first trip to the playoffs 
and the Sixers' first since 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia clinched the sixth seed in the East with the  
victory and plays Orlando in the first rounding beginning Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows my agenda,'' team president Pat Croce said of  
Iverson. ``Get me a ring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the closing seconds of the game, Iverson passed up one final,  
stat-padding shot, choosing instead to dribble out the clock. He 
did it in style, laughing and high-stepping around like a kid on a 
playground. 
</P>
<P>
	As a rookie, or even last year, Iverson almost certainly would  
have heaved the ball toward the rim. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only my third year,'' Iverson said. ``I think the problem  
with me coming in was that people looked at my talents and they 
didn't want to let me grow as a basketball player and as a person. 
I think over time, maybe people will start to understand me and 
some of the critics will back off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, among his close circle of friends, Iverson had no trouble  
letting his emotions go. 
</P>
<P>
	``He got pretty teary-eyed, hugging everybody,'' Gaskins said.  
``He was just thanking all the people that were close to him and 
stuck by him and really believed in him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to embrace for at least five minutes. It was just one  
of those unforgettable moments, one of those moments I'll never 
forget. I'm just glad I was there.''

<HEADLINE> House Approves $13.1B for Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican congressional leaders hope to ship  
legislation to President Clinton next week financing the clash with 
Yugoslavia and shoring up the U.S. military around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	The House moved in that direction Thursday, approving a $13.1  
billion package by a resounding 311-105 vote. Republicans supported 
the bill by more than 4-to-1 and Democrats backed it by more than 
2-to-1, as both parties signaled support for U.S. troops in week 
six of the air campaign against Serb forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the strongest expression of support we can give them  
with this bill today,'' said House Appropriations Committee 
Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate has not produced its own measure, but GOP leaders  
there want to keep the package close to the $6 billion Clinton 
proposed last month. Most of the funds would come from this year's 
projected Social Security surplus, and Senate Republicans are 
squeamish because they have repeatedly pledged not to touch that 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon expressed thanks for the House  
vote. But he added, ``Our biggest fear was that this would get held 
up somehow, and frankly that's still a concern'' because the Senate 
has not acted. 
</P>
<P>
	Underlining the difficulty of opposing defense spending while  
U.S. troops are in combat, the White House budget office did not 
threaten a presidential veto of the House bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead it urged lawmakers ``to avoid confrontation'' by cutting  
the bill and adding aid for U.S. farmers and Central America. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans hope to work out a compromise and attach the  
military spending measure to another bill sought by Clinton but 
slowed in Congress. It bears aid for Central American nations 
battered by last fall's Hurricane Mitch and for U.S. farmers hurt 
by plummeting commodities prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the House measure included liberals unhappy that  
Clinton's request for the Pentagon had been doubled, and 
conservatives who oppose a conflict they say the president forced 
without congressional consultation. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Donald Manzullo, R-Ill., said supporting the troops means  
more than just supplying them with weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means giving them the constitutional protection not to be  
put into the war'' without Congress' consent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	An effort led by Rep. Ernest Istook, R-Okla., to bar a ground  
war without lawmakers' approval was defeated 301-117. 
</P>
<P>
	The House voted 249-180 last week for nearly identical language  
requiring congressional approval for a ground campaign, a symbolic 
measure lawmakers knew Clinton would veto. With Democrats warning 
of a veto of the entire spending bill if Istook's language was 
attached, Istook's proposal was defeated. 
</P>
<P>
	A Democratic attempt to shrink the spending measure lost  
260-164. It would have left the bill at $11.6 billion -- including 
$1.3 billion for Central America and U.S. farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	In another vote eight days ago, the House refused to support the  
U.S.-led NATO air campaign, with Republicans supplying most of the 
opposition. Democrats contrasted that with Thursday's passage of 
twice the $6 billion Clinton wanted to wage the air war through 
September and care for hundreds of thousands of refugees who have 
fled Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have frankly got whiplash from watching the majority party  
reverse its position,'' said Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, top 
Democrat on the Appropriations panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The House's additions include $1.1 billion to buy missiles and  
bombs, $1.3 billion for spare parts, $1.8 billion to improve 
troops' pay and pensions, and $1.1 billion to modernize military 
bases, mostly in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans used Thursday's debate to try pinning the need  
for the extra money on Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The White House has bombed its way around the globe while  
dropping troops far and wide for ill-defined peacemaking duties,'' 
said House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas. ``This policy has 
gutted the American military -- which now must be rebuilt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By voice vote, lawmakers approved language by Rep. Tom Latham,  
R-Iowa, adding nearly $110 million in assistance to American 
farmers. A provision by Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., adding $67 
million in refugee aid was also added by voice vote.

<HEADLINE> Talk Show Slaying Case Wraps Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Claiming producers of ``The Jenny Jones  
Show'' did everything but pull the trigger, lawyers for the family 
of a guest who was killed after taping the program asked for a 
verdict of $71.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors were to begin deliberating today after attorney Geoffrey  
Fieger argued that the show and its corporate owner, Warner Bros., 
were liable for the shooting death of Scott Amedure, a gay man who 
was killed after revealing his crush on another guest. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones attended Wednesday's closing arguments in her first  
visit to the courtroom since she sparred with Fieger on the witness 
stand in April. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has the audacity to come here today,'' Fieger told the  
jury, pointing at her. ``It's important enough for Ms. Jones to 
come here today when the show is going to be held responsible for 
its actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amedure, 32, died in 1995 after disclosing his attraction to  
Jonathan Schmitz on the show. Authorities said Schmitz bought a 
shotgun, drove to Amedure's trailer in Oakland County's Orion 
Township and shot him twice in the chest three days after the 
taping. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz was found guilty of murder in 1996, but his conviction  
was thrown out on appeal. His retrial is set for Aug. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Amedure's family contends a mentally ill Schmitz was lured onto  
the show believing he would meet a woman, and was humiliated into 
murder when his secret admirer turned out to be Amedure. Schmitz 
has said he is heterosexual. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Warner Bros. argued Schmitz was told his secret  
admirer could be a man or woman, and the show played no role in 
Amedure's death. They also contend Schmitz might have killed 
Amedure because the two had a sexual encounter, a charge Fieger 
denied. 
</P>
<P>
	``They solicited a victim. They picked a murderer and provided a  
motive,'' Fieger said of the show. ``They did everything in this 
case except pull the trigger.''

<HEADLINE> Sen. Gramm Rallies the Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- He failed in the last Congress to break down  
Depression-era barriers prohibiting banks, securities firms and 
insurance companies from delving into each other's businesses. This 
time, Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, with help from 
the financial industry, is having some success. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want a bill,'' Gramm, R-Texas, told some 40 lobbyists  
at a meeting during a March snowstorm, ``you're going to have to do 
some work here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cash-flush industries, paired with a powerful committee  
chairman, went to work. Nine industry groups, including the 
American Bankers Association and American Insurance Association, 
sent a letter last month to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, 
R-Miss., and Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. , urging prompt 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Top officers of three major securities firms -- David Komansky of  
Merrill Lynch, Philip Purcell of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, and 
Sanford Weill of Citigroup -- jointly signed letters to lawmakers 
and opinion pieces to newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the Securities Industry Association faxed sample  
letters to their member firms and asked them to sign and return the 
papers, which were then sent to the appropriate lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have people who are from the state of the senator or a  
district of a congressman and you ask them to contact their elected 
representative and tell them how their constituents feel,'' said 
Steve Judge, the SIA's senior vice president of government affairs. 
``That's what democracy is about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the bill passed the Senate, where similar  
legislation had died just six months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	What set the lobbying effort apart from the many each year in  
Washington was the extensive role Gramm played. After the March 
gathering, he continued to meet regularly with the lobbyists to 
discuss their strategy and get progress reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm's office said he got the idea from watching Sen. Robert  
Byrd, D-W.Va., mobilize interest groups in the last Congress to 
successfully amend the surface transportation bill to ensure 
gasoline taxes were spent on highways. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking nothing for chance, the Texas Republican did plenty of  
lobbying of his own, buttonholing more than half of his 99 
colleagues to make his own pitch. ``I find that in talking to 
people face-to-face, you tend to get their attention,'' Gramm said. 
</P>
<P>
	Observed Sen. Spence Abraham, R-Mich: ``He's been briefing  
everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm, a longtime supporter of the financial industry, received  
$1.8 million in campaign contributions between 1993 and 1998 from 
banks, savings and loans, insurers and securities firms. That's 
more than any other member of the Senate, according to the Center 
for Responsive Politics. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry has much invested in Congress, doling out $23.3  
million to congressional candidates in the 1998 election cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm's bill would make it easier for banks, securities firms  
and insurance companies to enter each other's businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	A bank, for example, could write insurance and sell stocks in  
addition to offering savings and checking accounts. A firm that 
sells stocks could also sell insurance and set up its own bank. 
Consumers would shop at, in Gramm's words, ``a supermarket for 
financial services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the bill are not nearly as well-heeled. Three  
consumer groups opposing the legislation -- Consumers Union, the 
Consumer Federation of America, and the U.S. Public Interest 
Research Group -- spent $540,000 to lobby during the last six months 
of 1998. Three industry groups lobbying for the bill -- the American 
Bankers Association, the Securities Industry Association and the 
American Council of Life Insurance -- spent 12 times that, or $6.7 
million, during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the opponents are making their position known. USPIRG,  
for example, churned out faxes to senators, and sent e-mails and 
faxes to members asking them to do likewise. ``We call everybody 
and we fax everybody,'' said Edmund Mierzwinski, a consumer 
advocate with USPIRG.

<HEADLINE> Senate Passes Banking Overhaul Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sweeping legislation that would let banks,  
securities firms and insurance companies meld to create big 
financial ``supermarkets'' has pushed through the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The mostly party-line vote Thursday evening was 54-44, though  
the bill faces a likely presidential veto if Congress sends it to 
President Clinton without changes. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would lift Depression-era legal barriers separating the  
three industries, allowing the new companies to sell consumers 
everything from checking accounts to car insurance to mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
	It includes a provision that would make it a federal crime for  
anyone to misrepresent himself to obtain someone's private 
financial data. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration supports the legislation in  
principle. But in a showdown with Senate Banking Committee Chairman 
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, it has threatened a presidential veto of the 
bill unless there are major changes, including the removal of 
provisions that Democrats view as an attack on the 1977 Community 
Reinvestment Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think in the end, the president's going to have to decide,  
is he for a financial modernization bill,'' Gramm told reporters 
during the evening vote, which followed 2 1/2 days of debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm said he believed it was possible to work out a compromise  
on the issues in contention. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., called it ``exactly the wrong bill at  
exactly the wrong time. ... This is moving this country in the 
wrong direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Removing the barriers separating banks, brokerage firms and  
insurers would increase the likelihood of future taxpayer bailouts 
of big institutions that fail, Dorgan warned. 
</P>
<P>
	``This orgy of big bank mergers in our country moves now at an  
accelerated pace, unabated,'' he said. He cited recent 
consolidations including those in which banking giant Citicorp 
merged with brokerage-insurer Travelers Group in a deal valued at 
$36.9 billion, NationsBank Corp. and BankAmerica Corp. combined in 
a $41.5 billion marriage and Banc One Corp. and First Chicago NBD 
Corp. united in an $18.7 billion deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Proponents of the financial overhaul legislation, led by Wall  
Street and the insurance industry, maintain it is needed to keep 
the U.S. financial industry competitive in global markets and that 
it would save consumers millions by providing one-stop financial 
shopping. The financial industries have spent millions lobbying for 
the legislation in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar financial overhaul bill recently cleared the House  
Banking Committee and is being reviewed by the House Commerce 
Committee, which has given it a lukewarm reception. 
</P>
<P>
	The chances of a presidential veto also were increased Thursday  
when the Senate rebuffed an effort by Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., 
and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., to steer the 
legislation toward the view of the administration. 
</P>
<P>
	They sponsored an amendment that brought to the Senate floor a  
long-simmering debate between the administration and Fed Chairman 
Alan Greenspan, whose view is supported by most Republicans, over 
the best bank corporate structure to allow in revamping the 
financial services laws. It was killed on a 53-46 vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and the administration want to  
let banks get into new kinds of financial activities through 
subsidiaries of the banks themselves, not just through affiliated 
companies within the same parent holding company. That arrangement 
would increase the power of the Treasury's Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency, regulator of nationally chartered 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan and most GOP lawmakers, on the other hand, want to let  
banks diversify through a holding company structure. That would 
expand the independent Federal Reserve's role as a regulator. 
</P>
<P>
	The privacy amendment takes aim at the practice of pretext  
calling, in which people call employees at banks and other 
businesses and use easily available data, such as Social Security 
numbers, to get information about bank accounts and other financial 
data. 
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't go as far as many privacy advocates would like,  
however. 
</P>
<P>
	Edmund Mierzwinski, consumer program director for the U.S.  
Public Interest Research Group, called it ``a scam and a sham'' and 
a ``substitute for true privacy reform.'' Among other things, he 
said, the lawmakers should have addressed the issue of affiliated 
financial companies sharing their customers' data with each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Clinton urged Congress to bolster consumers'  
rights when banks and other financial companies seek to share or 
sell information about them. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's proposals include requiring banks and other financial  
institutions to tell consumers when they plan to share or sell 
personal financial information, and giving consumers the power to 
stop such transfers. He also wants to restrict any sharing of 
customers' medical information by affiliated companies within a 
financial conglomerate.

<HEADLINE> Hot Response for Budweiser Gay Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Anheuser Busch Inc.'s advertisement for Bud  
Light showing two men holding hands has prompted a flood of phone 
calls, forcing the beer maker to set up two hotlines. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad appeared in the April 22 issue of EXP magazine, a free,  
bimonthly St. Louis publication that is geared toward gays and 
lesbians but is distributed in mainstream outlets. The ad tells 
people to ``Be Yourself and Make It a Bud Light.'' It also carries 
a tagline saying ``Proud Sponsor of the St. Louis PrideFest '99.'' 
PrideFest is a gay and lesbian festival held in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the ad ran, leaders in the gay community began  
distributing e-mail, urging people to call Anheuser-Busch in 
support of the ad. The St. Louis brewer was so overwhelmed with 
calls that it set up a hotline for supporters to use. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative Christian leader Jerry Falwell also found out about  
the ad and sent his followers e-mail, advising them to call 
Anheuser-Busch to ask that a hotline be set up so that they could 
oppose the ad. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's keep the heat on Anheuser-Busch so that they understand  
that pro-family Americans are terribly concerned about homosexual 
images coming into our homes through reckless advertising 
campaigns,'' Falwell wrote in his Falwell Confidential. 
</P>
<P>
	Anheuser-Busch officials declined to comment about the results  
of the calls or whether they will have any effect on further plans 
for the advertisement. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's surprising to us that one print ad placed in select  
gay-oriented magazines has attracted attention,'' the beer maker 
said in a brief statement. ``Today's consumer is not one of a 
specific gender, race, geography or orientation. We appreciate and 
respect the views of all our customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ad will later appear in other publications that cater to  
gays, lesbians and others with alternative lifestyles.

<HEADLINE> East Timorese Still in Fear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- International officials hope a  
U.N.-sponsored ballot in East Timor will end the bloody violence 
among factions for and against independence from Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	But after decades of human rights abuses and weeks of escalating  
fighting, some in the former Portuguese colony were still too 
afraid Thursday to say what they want -- casting doubt on whether 
the vote can be held freely. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can die for talking about such things,'' said Domingos  
Sequera, who sells cabbages in a market in Dili, East Timor's 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't ask me what I will vote for. It's a secret,'' said  
another vendor, Ijoalina Belo. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia and Portugal signed an agreement Wednesday allowing  
the East Timorese to vote Aug. 8 on whether to become an autonomous 
state within Indonesia or break away. 
</P>
<P>
	In a show of broad international support, 36 nations offered to  
give financial support for the ballot during a meeting at the 
United Nations on Thursday, although they are waiting to hear the 
needs for the vote before making specific pledges. 
</P>
<P>
	Portugal and Australia have already made contributions of $10  
million and $7 million respectively to a U.N. trust fund set up for 
the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and later annexed it. In a  
surprise reversal, it said this year it would grant independence if 
East Timor's people reject the autonomy offer struck after 15 years 
of negotiations between Portugal and Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would give the East Timorese control over local  
administration, education and cultural affairs, while Indonesia 
would stay responsible for security and defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after the U.N. agreement was signed, about 100 students  
demonstrated for independence outside the state University of East 
Timor, and raised a banner that read, ``Reject autonomy in every 
form.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has called for an immediate  
end to violence and the disarming of all factions so the vote can 
proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is also deeply troubled by the unrestrained  
activities of militias who ``seek to bias the consultation through 
terror and intimidation,'' State Department spokesman James Foley 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	About 600 U.N. officials and advisers, including foreign police  
officers, were expected to start arriving in East Timor soon. 
</P>
<P>
	It's unclear, though, how they will end the bloodshed.  
</P>
<P>
	Anti-independence militiamen have killed dozens of civilians in  
recent weeks, and separatist rebels who have fought a guerrilla war 
for two decades have stepped up attacks against the military. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of villagers have fled their homes in terror. Armed  
gangs block roads in the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
	Militia leaders have criticized the U.N. agreement and  
threatened U.N. police advisers. Some said they accepted the ballot 
because they had no choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will accept any kind of outcome,'' activist Basilio Araujo  
said. ``Now we are powerless to stop the process that has been 
going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eurico Guterres, the leader of one militia group accused of  
attacking civilians recently, said he accepted the ballot plan but 
could not ensure the safety of U.N. staff or that the violence will 
stop. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor could he say whether his group would disarm in line with the  
U.N. agreement covering security for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Disarmament won't be successful if it is not done fairly,'' he  
said. Pro-independence rebels ``must put down their weapons first 
before we will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Independence activists say the vast majority of East Timorese  
want to be separate from Indonesia, and accuse sections of the army 
of backing the militias in an attempt to derail the U.N. ballot 
through fear. Indonesia's generals deny the charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Separatist rebel leader Jose Alexandre ``Xanana'' Gusmao, who is  
under house arrest in the Indonesian capital Jakarta, hailed the 
agreement as ``historic'' and called on Indonesia to live up to 
U.N. demands that it keep the peace during the ballot period. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no doubt that there will be difficulties on the  
ground and that numerous obstacles will continue to be placed in 
the path of the preparation of a fair, democratic and transparent 
consultation,'' he said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> 'Cider House' Staged Off-Broadway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In ``The Cider House Rules,'' orphan Homer Wells  
wonders if he can be the hero of his own life. It's a personal and 
moral dilemma audiences should find intriguing -- and more than a 
little moving. 
</P>
<P>
	The wide-eyed, innocent lad has plenty of opportunity to test  
his mettle in this ambitious stage adaptation of John Irving's 
sprawling novel that has made its way to New York after productions 
by the Seattle Repertory Company and the Mark Taper Forum in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	New Yorkers are seeing only part one of the show at  
off-Broadway's Atlantic Theater Company. Production of part two 
depends on the first half's reception. Judging from this terrific 
initial effort, the Atlantic should proceed immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Subtitled ``Here at St. Cloud's,'' the three-hour-plus  
production is story theater at its crowd-pleasing best. In fact, it 
takes the form a step further, artfully blending narrative and 
dialogue lifted directly from the book within adapter Peter 
Parnell's careful condensation of the voluminous plot. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort, directed by Tom Hulce and Jane Jones, is seamless,  
with 19 performers slipping in and out of multiple roles as quickly 
as they can change costumes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cider House'' is a big novel with big themes, told in an  
expansive, leisurely style that would do Charles Dickens proud. In 
fact, young Homer reveres David Copperfield, another orphan who 
makes his way in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Irving populates his novel with a parade of memorable characters  
who span more than half a century, from the 1880s into the days 
following World War II. Central to his tale is the relationship 
between Homer and Dr. Wilbur Larch, a man who does what he calls 
the Lord's work and the devil's work at St. Cloud's, an orphanage 
in rural Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Larch delivers unwanted babies -- and also aborts them, depending  
on the wishes of the mother. ``Here at St. Cloud's, I try to 
consider, with each rule I make or break, that my first priority is 
an orphan's future,'' Larch says. 
</P>
<P>
	Homer is the one true orphan at St. Cloud's, adopted and then  
returned by three different families. Larch, his two adoring nurses 
and an equally unadoptable female orphan named Melony become his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the three leads from the Los Angeles production have come  
with the show to New York -- and deservedly so. Josh Hamilton could 
not be better as the bewildered, sweet-tempered Homer, a young man 
whose convictions are tested daily by what he learns of Larch's 
doings at St. Cloud's. 
</P>
<P>
	Irving's novel doesn't take the easy way out in dealing with the  
question of abortion. The author clearly -- and clinically -- 
presents both sides of the argument, something Parnell also does in 
his stage version. 
</P>
<P>
	Jillian Armenante is nothing less than astonishing as the  
snarling, tomboyish Melony, who instructs Homer in the mysteries of 
sex. Armenante, a solidly built woman, barrels through the role 
with audacious authority. It is a brazen, career-defining 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	A ruddy Colm Meaney, a fine new addition, displays a determined  
yet kind manner that gives Larch moral weight, the authority to 
make life-and-death decisions at St. Cloud's. 
</P>
<P>
	What's curious about this ``Cider House Rules'' is that it  
leaves the audience hanging. The ``rules'' of the title are never 
introduced. They await explanation in the second half, which 
apparently Parnell, Hulce and Jones are revising extensively. Let's 
hope they work quickly. There is an audience eager to know what 
happens to Homer and his dealings with ``The Cider House Rules.''

<HEADLINE> Fraud Alleged in Tobacco Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEXARKANA, Texas (AP) -- The attorney general of Texas has  
accused his predecessor of conniving to enrich a lawyer friend with 
a massive payout from the state's $17.3 billion tobacco settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge David Folsom was to hear arguments today  
over whether former Attorney General Dan Morales, a Democrat, 
fabricated contracts with attorney Marc Murr that led to $260 
million in legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
	John Cornyn, a Republican who replaced Morales as attorney  
general, claims the fee award was obtained through fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	A state arbitration panel awarded the fees to Murr for his role  
in the settlement obtained by Texas from the tobacco industry. 
Other attorneys in the case have said Murr did little or no work; 
Morales has said Murr played a crucial role in negotiating the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornyn tried to compel Morales to testify at today's hearing,  
but Folsom on Wednesday denied the request. 
</P>
<P>
	Morales' attorney, Sam Millsap, accused Cornyn of trying to turn  
the hearing ``into a political circus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm frustrated, as is Dan, that these bizarre allegations will  
hang out there until the appropriate time and place for response. 
There was no fraud. That simply is untrue,'' Millsap said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornyn's office is investigating whether Morales tried to funnel  
a portion of the settlement to Murr. The Justice Department and FBI 
are also conducting investigations.

<HEADLINE> US Role in Mideast Peace Discussed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The American mediation role in the  
Arab-Israeli dispute is expanding, and it could influence the 
outcome of Mideast peace talks, Israel's U.S. ambassador says. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a need for a sheriff, but the sheriff should not be  
put in the position of a judge,'' Ambassador Zalman Shoval said 
Wednesday night. ``And the sheriff should remember who the good 
guys are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech and in response to questions at the American  
Enterprise Institute, a private research group, Shoval emphasized 
the unique role the United States played in mediating between 
Israel and the Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
	He stressed how the United States sometimes stood alone in  
support of Israel in world forums. 
</P>
<P>
	But, the veteran diplomat said, the U.S. role in mediating  
between Israel and the Palestinians has changed over the years to 
the point where it could influence the outcome of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Any Israeli accord with the Palestinians must be worked out by  
the two sides and have their approval, he said. ``We should not 
slide into a situation where we say `Let George do it, let Bill do 
it, let Dennis do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shoval's remarks seemed intended for President Clinton and  
Dennis Ross, the senior U.S. mediator, although he also underscored 
the importance Israel attaches to America's friendship for the 
Jewish state. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, the Israeli envoy criticized Russia for providing  
advanced technology to Iran and other ``rogue states'' that he said 
could threaten Israel with nuclear weapons and destabilize the 
Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are concerned about that,'' Shoval' said, even as his  
government strengthens its ties with Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, in an interview, Shoval drew positive conclusions from  
a letter Clinton sent Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
	He said its most important message was that negotiations were  
the only way for the Palestinians to achieve their goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The letter is a total denial of unilateral actions on the part  
of the Palestinians,'' Shoval said after casting absentee ballots 
in Israel's national elections. ``We fully agree with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wrote Arafat the Palestinians deserved ``to live free,  
today, tomorrow and forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While he did not explicitly call for a Palestinian state, his  
letter was bound to boost Palestinian hopes for U.S. support toward 
that goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoval said, however, ``the Palestinians may read into this  
message more than is actually said in it. That's their problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A State Department spokesman, James Foley, said the Clinton  
administration was not going to take a position on statehood. Asked 
whether the Bush administration's assurance to Israel that it did 
not back statehood was still in effect, Foley said: ``That is a 
matter to be determined in negotiations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter was timed to the passing of a target date set by  
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization for dealing with 
statehood and other tough issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton assured Arafat the Palestinians had a right to  
``determine their own future on their own land.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat had vowed to establish a state, with its capital in  
Jerusalem, if the Palestinians did not achieve statehood in 
negotiations with Israel by May 4. Under pressure from the Clinton 
administration to curb his rhetoric, the Palestinian leader 
subsequently spoke in terms of aspirations.

<HEADLINE> Feds Sue Firm for Misleading Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government has sued a company that  
allegedly tricked people into paying for services that the Social 
Security Administration offers for free, such as getting a Social 
Security card for a newborn baby. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit against Federal Record Service Corp., filed Thursday  
in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, 
accuses the company of fraud in its mailings to millions of 
American households. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Barbara S. Jones issued a temporary restraining order  
directing Federal Record Service to cease its solicitations, 
freezing its assets and authorizing the U.S. Postal Service to 
detain its incoming mail. 
</P>
<P>
	``For far too long, Federal Record Service has been picking the  
pocket of the American public through deceptive practices in an 
effort to sell an unnecessary service,'' Social Security 
Commissioner Kenneth S. Apfel said in a statement. ``Today's action 
proves ... it can't hide from the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials did not immediately respond to requests for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the suit, Federal Record Service sent letters to  
recently married couples or families with new babies. In the 
letters, the company offered, for a $15 fee, to help obtain a new 
Social Security number and card for a new baby or an updated card 
for a bride who had changed her name. 
</P>
<P>
	Most new parents, whether they know it or not, order a Social  
Security number for their newborn as part of the birth registration 
process at the hospital. If not, forms to do so can be obtained for 
free at any local Social Security office or by calling a toll-free 
government number. Similarly, Social Security will make name 
changes for free. 
</P>
<P>
	When someone accepted the Federal Record Service offer, the  
company would often simply mail them the appropriate, free form, 
Social Security officials said. Other times victims would never 
hear from the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Record Service is incorporated in New York and Florida,  
and operates out of offices in both those states, as well as in 
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has allegedly operated for years. But it took new  
laws against misleading advertising, passed by Congress in 1994, 
and a long investigation to build the case the government brought 
Thursday, according to officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have received more complaints against Federal Record  
Service Corp. than any other company,'' said James G. Huse, Jr., 
Social Security's acting inspector general. ``Today we are taking 
aggressive action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A hearing in the case has been scheduled for May 13.

<HEADLINE> Crosses Re-Erected at Colo. School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The 13 crosses honoring the slain at  
Columbine High School are back. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the April 20 shootings, Greg Zanis built 15 wooden  
crosses in his Aurora, Ill., garage, drove to Littleton and put 
them on a hill overlooking the school. 
</P>
<P>
	A father of one of the 13 victims destroyed the crosses  
inscribed with the names of the gunmen, Eric Harris and Dylan 
Klebold. Zanis took the rest down to stem the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	But after receiving calls from Littleton residents, Zanis  
replaced the crosses of the victims Wednesday, vowing never to 
erect another for a murderer ``unless I know he's accepted the 
Lord.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, 18, and Klebold, 17, stormed Columbine with guns and  
bombs, killing 12 students and a teacher and wounding 23 others 
before committing suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Detectives have pursued a wider conspiracy, specifically  
checking to see whether there was a third gunman or others who 
helped plot the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, a 17-year-old student accused by Sheriff John  
Stone of withholding information about the massacre angrily 
criticized the sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have no evidence against me. They have nothing. Actually,  
I know that the FBI has said that I'm not a suspect. The DA has 
said that I'm not a suspect,'' Brooks Brown said in an interview 
outside his home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both have said I'm just a witness. I don't know why Sheriff  
(John) Stone is doing this. ... I just don't think he's thinking 
before he talks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In newspaper and national television show interviews, Stone has  
said he believes Brown knows more about the attack than he has told 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown's parents had earlier criticized Stone for failing to act  
after they told deputies last year that Harris had threatened their 
son and had written about bombs and murder on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, who reconciled with Harris after the threats, said Harris  
warned him to stay away from the school moments before the attack. 
Brown's brother was in the cafeteria during the rampage -- a fact 
Brown says proves his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown and his parents, Randall and Judy Brown, swept aside  
Stone's suspicions and said his comments stemmed from their 
criticism of his department. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis reiterated Wednesday that no one  
has been labeled a suspect, including Brooks Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said earlier this week they were leaning toward  
the theory that Harris and Klebold acted alone, but Stone said he 
believes there may have been a third gunman, based on interviews 
with student witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had a lot of witnesses tell us there was a third  
suspect and we've said that from day one,'' Davis said. ``But, from 
day one, we've said we hadn't had any concrete evidence to show 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stone, who has been deluged with interview requests since the  
attack, said he will scale back his public comment on the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Jefferson County Schools Superintendent Jane Hammond  
said the long-term costs of dealing with the shooting, including 
legal fees and tougher security at other schools could reach $50 
million.

<HEADLINE> Jagr Leading Penguins Into Round Two </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Fun-loving. Charismatic. Immature. Gifted.  
Emotional. 
</P>
<P>
	Many words have been used to describe Jaromir Jagr, hockey's  
most creative scorer and recognizable face now that Wayne Gretzky 
and Mario Lemieux are retired. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's a word never used until now: Courageous.  
</P>
<P>
	That changed Sunday, when the badly injured Jagr dragged himself  
off a trainer's table and onto the ice for a game he wasn't 
supposed to play, indelibly etching an unforgettable image of 
fearlessness. 
</P>
<P>
	Remember Willis Reed limping onto the court to help win Game 7  
of the 1970 NBA Finals for the New York Knicks? Many hockey fans 
will relive Jagr's performance in pain with the same mix of 
wonderment and respect. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was unbelievable what he did,'' said Pittsburgh teammate  
Martin Straka, invoking another adjective as synonymous with Jagr 
as his first name. 
</P>
<P>
	Barely able to skate because of a groin injury that sidelined  
him for four games, Jagr scored the tying goal late in the third 
period and the game-winner in overtime against top-seeded New 
Jersey. By doing so, he saved the Penguins not only from 
elimination, but possible extinction as the franchise's future is 
played out to an uncertain fate in bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr was almost as good in Game 7, drawing so much attention  
from the snare drum-tight Devils that it changed the tempo of the 
game. He set up the final two goals as the last-seeded Penguins 
upset the top-seeded Devils, finishing off the greatest upset in 
franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with a second-round series against Toronto set to begin  
Friday, what possibly could be left for Jagr to do? 
</P>
<P>
	As it turns out, quite a lot.  
</P>
<P>
	``I went into it to win the Stanley Cup. I'm not going for  
anything else,'' said Jagr, who is not close to 100 percent but 
still expects to play. ``I know that sounds very confident, but 
that is the way I am. I think we have the chance to beat anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Preposterous? So was beating the Devils.  
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky passed the torch, and the title of ``hockey's greatest  
player,'' to Jagr during teary-eyed ceremonies last month, spoiled 
only a little when Jagr sent Gretzky out a loser by scoring the 
game-winning goal in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Jagr -- once derided as being too self-centered,  
ingenuous and childlike to be the leader of men, much less of an 
entire sport -- has been a fitting replacement for hockey's one 
irreplaceable player. 
</P>
<P>
	``The greatest player leaves the game and the next greatest  
player scores in overtime, just to announce who the next guy is,'' 
Penguins coach Kevin Constantine said. 
</P>
<P>
	Constantine got his share of grief for overseeing Jagr's  
appointment last fall as the Penguins' captain. Jagr always was 
more of a follower of former captains Lemieux and Ron Francis than 
a leader, and his penchant for speaking his mind -- especially in 
disagreement with his coach -- is not a quality sought in a captain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jaromir not only is the best player on this team, he is the  
best player in the world,'' Constantine said. ``He needs to be the 
captain of this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Constantine's faith in Jagr as a leader was justified by the  
Jersey series. Jagr's valorous effort likely would be the talk of 
the sports world if the NHL had the high national profile of the 
NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could not watch,'' Jagr said. ``I had to play.''  
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, Jagr no longer is the impressionable 18-year-old who  
was fascinated by fast cars and fast skating when he came into the 
league in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	He is 27, more worldly and adult. He doesn't frequent night  
clubs or casinos as much as before. He talks privately of a 
personal spiritual reawakening that took place back in his native 
Czech Republic last summer, though he will not expound on it. 
</P>
<P>
	Even more remarkably, Jagr's play has come against the backdrop  
of the Penguins' uncertain fate as the NHL presses for a resolution 
of bankruptcy proceedings. It is possible the Penguins will know 
definitely they are headed for another city even before the 
playoffs are over. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux saved hockey in Pittsburgh. Jagr is trying to do it  
again, by taking the Penguins so deep into the playoffs that it 
rallies civic and business leaders to help preserve them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think my goal is going to save the team in Pittsburgh.  
It has nothing to do with that, but I think the city and everybody 
should support Mario,'' Jagr said. ``We're just trying to win the 
Cup.''

<HEADLINE> Warriors Make Progress in 1998-99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- When the Warriors announced Wednesday  
night during their season-ending loss to San Antonio that a lucky 
fan had won a basketball autographed by coach P.J. Carlesimo, there 
were boos in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what happens when a team, despite showing improvement  
over the previous year, finishes with a losing record and out of 
the playoffs for the fifth straight season -- and does little to 
convince fans those streaks won't stretch to six seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, Golden State's 21-29 record in this lockout-shortened  
season was a lot better than the 19-63 mark last season. And there 
were flashes of brilliance down the stretch from rookie Antawn 
Jamison, the Warriors' first productive draft pick in years. 
</P>
<P>
	But a year after Latrell Sprewell choked Carlesimo, depriving  
the Warriors of their best player and turning Golden State from a 
bad team into a woeful club, there perhaps was not enough 
rebuilding to promise better times ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlesimo gave plenty of playing time to veterans such as Terry  
Cummings and Muggsy Bogues, taking those minutes away from young 
players such as Jamison, Erick Dampier, Jason Caffey and Tony Delk. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting center Dampier, who will be eligible for free agency,  
did not play down the stretch in some tight games and might have 
that in mind when he decides whether to re-sign with the Warriors. 
Delk, a backup point guard, already has said he expects to be 
elsewhere next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlesimo defended his decision to go with veterans at times,  
saying he simply was trying to put the best team on the floor as 
the Warriors made a bid for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've found out a lot more about (our young  
players),'' Carlesimo said. ``Had they done better, they'd be 
playing more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though the Warriors led the NBA in rebounding for the second  
straight season, they continued to struggle on offense. Shooting 
guard John Starks, obtained from the New York Knicks as part of the 
Jan. 26 trade for Sprewell, led the team with 13.8 points per game 
-- the lowest team-leading average since the Warriors moved west 
from Philadelphia in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
	But Starks shot just 37 percent, including a 3-for-14  
performance in the season-closer against the Spurs. And the 
Warriors still lack a quality point guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Starks remained upbeat, though, focusing on the team's  
improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	``This organization has been through some tough times the last  
few years, but as you can see they have made a lot of improvements 
to turn that around,'' he said. ``There is a great future ahead for 
us. I look forward to finishing my career here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The future depends a lot on the development of Jamison. Instead  
of picking a point guard such as Jason Williams, who was selected 
after Jamison in the draft and helped lead the Sacramento Kings 
into the playoffs, the Warriors went for a player who had trouble 
adjusting to the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamison was the college player of the year at North Carolina  
last season, but struggled with the switch from power forward to 
small forward. He ended up playing behind Chris Mills and Donyell 
Marshall, and not starting until the 26th game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he played well down the stretch, such as his 22-point,  
16-rebound performance in Wednesday's game against San Antonio, 
Jamison shot poorly from outside and had trouble handing the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know what I've got to do. I know what I need to work on,''  
he said. ``I experienced a lot of downs, and every once in a while 
I got a lot of ups. I think it is good that I struggled a lot this 
year and experienced a lot of lows. Right now it's time for me to 
work and improve every day.''

<HEADLINE> Greenspan: Robbers Pose Y2K Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is not  
worried that the world's financial markets will come crashing down 
because of the Year 2000 computer problem. His fear is more basic -- 
a rash of robberies spawned by people keeping too much cash lying 
around. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech to a Chicago audience, Greenspan worried that the  
news media will so dramatize the dangers of computer system 
meltdowns on Jan. 1, 2000, that the fears will affect the real 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the evening news is going to play it as though we are  
looking at an asteroid which is about to hit us,'' said Greenspan, 
who is married to NBC News reporter Andrea Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said he is concerned that people will become  
vulnerable to robbers who see an opportunity to get their hands 
``on real cash.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, he said, Americans should see through any media hype  
and realize there will be no major breakdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am sure that people will get very wise very soon and  
recognize that the last thing you want to do is draw inordinate 
amounts of currency out of the banks,'' Greenspan said. ``The 
safest thing to do is to keep your money in the bank where it is 
going to be the safest.''

<HEADLINE> George Washington Statue Tells Lies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOBBS FERRY, N.Y. (AP) -- George Washington could not tell a lie,  
but a bunch of fibs about him and his men are etched in stone on 
his monument high above the Hudson River. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this monument were a true-false test, the first four  
answers would be `false,''' says Robert Stackpole, president of the 
New York chapter of the Sons of the American Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization, which erected the monument in 1894, is a bit  
embarrassed by it and wants to mark this year's bicentennial of 
Washington's death by somehow correcting the mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-foot-high marker, nestled in a grassy grotto in Dobbs  
Ferry, claims to mark the site of Washington's headquarters late 
during the Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's false,'' says Stackpole, a retired investment banker  
from White Plains. ``The house they said was his headquarters 
wasn't even built until after the war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Washington was actually stationed a couple of miles away, in  
what is now Ardsley, Stackpole says, brandishing a Frenchman's 
contemporaneous maps to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
	The monument also claims:  
</P>
<P>
	--''Here, July 6, 1781, the French allies under Rochambeau joined  
the American army.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--''Here, August 14, 1781, Washington planned the Yorktown  
campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--''Here, May 8, 1783, Washington and Sir Guy Carleton arranged  
for the evacuation of American soil by the British.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``False, false, false,'' says Stackpole. He and Bill Blanck,  
president of the Dobbs Ferry Historical Society, agree that none of 
the events took place in what is now Dobbs Ferry. Rochambeau's 
troops joined up in Hartsdale, the Yorktown campaign was planned in 
Connecticut and Ardsley, and the evacuation was arranged across the 
river in Rockland County. 
</P>
<P>
	Stackpole is not taking credit for turning up the errors.  
</P>
<P>
	``When this was erected, anybody who knew anything knew it was  
wrong,'' Stackpole says. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Stackpole's organization was taken to task in the  
Tarrytown Argus of May 23, 1895, just a few months after the 
monument was dedicated. The editor wrote: ``It is curious if not 
astonishing that in view of the unquestioned facts ... the Sons of 
the American Revolution should have been a party to such a stupid 
monumental blunder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stackpole suspects greed may have had something to do with the  
hijacking of history. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were crazy for American history at that time,'' he  
says. ``If you could sell the area as historic, that these events 
happened here in Dobbs Ferry, that made this a great place to 
live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Brian Monahan says he would be delighted to see the  
monument corrected, especially since the Sons of the American 
Revolution are willing to foot the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody interested in the subject knew it was wrong and  
thought we were trying to take credit for something,'' the mayor 
says. ``Which we weren't, at least not now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for a remedy, that's still to be decided. Some think the  
flawed monument is now historic itself and should be left alone, 
with perhaps a nearby explanation of the truth. Stackpole and 
Blanck seem to lean toward sandblasting away the misinformation, if 
that's not too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	Stackpole says the monument could then be rechiseled with the  
only statement now on the monument that hasn't come under attack: 
</P>
<P>
	``Opposite this point May 8, 1783, a British sloop of war fired  
17 guns in honor of the American commander in chief, the first 
salute by Great Britain to the United States of America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Is that really true?  
</P>
<P>
	``Probably true,'' Stackpole says. ``True enough.''

<HEADLINE> Details of of AP Poll on Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Associated Press poll on guns is based on telephone  
interviews with 765 randomly selected adults from all states except 
Alaska and Hawaii. The interviewing was conducted April 16-19 by 
ICR of Media, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP poll on guns and school violence is based on telephone  
interviews with 1,006 people taken April 28-May 2 by ICR. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were weighted to represent the population by key  
demographic factors such as age, sex, region and education. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first poll, no more than one time in 20 should chance  
variations in the sample cause the results to vary by more than 4 
percentage points from the answers that would be obtained if all 
Americans were polled. The margin of error in the second poll is 
plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	This margin of sampling error is larger for responses of  
subgroups, such as income categories. There are other sources of 
potential error in polls, including the wording and order of 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP poll questions (because of rounding, sums may not total  
100 percent): 
</P>
<P>
	--Do you favor stricter gun control laws or do you oppose them?  
</P>
<P>
	(April 16-19) Favor, 55 percent; oppose, 34 percent; don't know,  
11 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	(April 28-May 2) Favor, 63 percent; oppose, 31 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Which of these is more likely to decrease gun violence ...  
</P>
<P>
	(April 16-19) Better enforcement of existing gun laws, 47  
percent; tougher gun laws, 42 percent; neither, 7 percent; don't 
know, 4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	(April 28-May 2) Better enforcement of existing gun laws, 39  
percent; tougher gun laws, 51 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Three gun questions asked in the April 16-19 poll.  
</P>
<P>
	--As you may know, several cities have filed lawsuits against gun  
manufacturers to recover money spent by hospitals and police 
departments dealing with gun violence. Do you think gun 
manufacturers should be held responsible for these costs, or not? 
</P>
<P>
	Should be held responsible, 21 percent; should not be held  
responsible, 70 percent; don't know, 8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--The federal government requires background checks for most gun  
purchases. Do you think these background checks help reduce the 
number of crimes committed with guns, or not? 
</P>
<P>
	Helps, 52 percent; doesn't help, 42 percent; don't know, 5  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Does anyone in your household own a gun?  
</P>
<P>
	Yes, 44 percent; no, 55 percent; declined to answer, 1 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	Three questions on school violence asked April 28-May 2.  
</P>
<P>
	--Which one of the following measures do you think would be the  
most effective way to stop violence in schools? 
</P>
<P>
	Reducing violence in TV shows and movies, 27 percent; putting  
metal detectors in schools, 23 percent; increasing counseling for 
teens, 21 percent; passing stricter gun laws, 10 percent; 
restricting Internet content, 9 percent; none of the above, 7 
percent; don't know, 4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Thinking about the shootings last week at a Colorado high  
school, please tell me which one of these do you think is most to 
blame? 
</P>
<P>
	The boys' parents, 39 percent; availability of guns, 24 percent;  
television and movies, 14 percent; the Internet, 8 percent; school 
officials, 4 percent; none of the above, 6 percent; don't know, 4 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Do you think the parents should face charges if they have a  
child under 18 who commits a crime with a gun? 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, 39 percent; no, 52 percent; don't know, 9 percent.

<HEADLINE> House Passes Bankruptcy Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation that would make it harder for  
people to sweep away their debts in bankruptcy easily passed the 
House despite a White House veto threat. 
</P>
<P>
	The House, seeking to stem the rising tide of personal  
bankruptcies, gave the bipartisan bill a 313-108 veto-proof vote 
Wednesday. The legislation, sought by credit card companies, got 
solid Republican support but split the Democrats. The Senate hasn't 
yet voted on a parallel measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration especially criticized the measure's  
creation of a ``means test'' based on debtors' income to determine 
whether they must gradually repay their debts or erase them 
entirely while under bankruptcy court protection from creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the White House called the means test  
``inflexible and arbitrary,'' while reaffirming its support in 
principle for rewriting the bankruptcy laws. 
</P>
<P>
	In another setback for the administration Wednesday, the Senate  
defeated, 52-45, an amendment that would have removed provisions in 
a financial services overhaul bill that Democrats saw as an attack 
on the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, R-Texas, wants to  
exempt small rural banks from the community-lending law and make it 
harder for the government to use satisfactory community-lending 
ratings as a requirement for banks being allowed to expand. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate also rejected, on a party-line 54-43 vote, a  
Democratic version of the financial services legislation, which 
would lift Depression-era barriers separating banks, securities 
firms and insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the House vote on the bankruptcy bill, Judiciary  
Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and Rep. John Conyers of 
Michigan, the panel's senior Democrat, tried to soften the means 
test provision, which uses the Internal Revenue Service's living 
expense standards to help determine how much debtors can repay. But 
their effort was rebuffed in a 238-184 vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Big bank-owned credit card networks, notably Visa and  
MasterCard, and retail-business groups say their losses from debts 
forgiven in bankruptcy have forced them to raise interest rates for 
consumers who handle credit responsibly. 
</P>
<P>
	But consumer groups, unions, civil rights groups and bankruptcy  
attorneys maintain the legislation favors corporate profits over 
the needs of families struggling with debt who need a fresh start. 
They insist that the credit card companies share the blame by 
flooding consumers with mailed solicitations to entice them into 
easy credit. 
</P>
<P>
	By voice vote, the lawmakers adopted an amendment requiring  
credit card companies to clearly disclose their late-payment fees 
and how long it would take customers to pay off balances if they 
make only minimum monthly payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies also would have to clearly reveal the expiration  
dates of introductory ``teaser rates'' and the higher interest 
rates replacing them. The same disclosures would have to be made in 
offers for credit card accounts made over the Internet, which have 
attracted an estimated 7.8 million people in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents also maintain that the bill, by barring certain credit  
card debts from being erased in bankruptcy, would force single 
mothers and children owed support by bankrupt fathers to compete 
with credit card companies in collecting debts. 
</P>
<P>
	But the measure's sponsors, led by Reps. George Gekas, R-Pa.,  
and Jim Moran, D-Va., say it gives highest priority among debts to 
child support and alimony payments, putting them ahead of credit 
card debt and other obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, bankruptcy overhaul legislation cleared the  
Banking Committee last month and went to the full chamber, but the 
key issue of providing information to credit card users remained 
unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers are responding to a rising tide of personal  
bankruptcies, which reached a record 1.4 million last year despite 
the strong economy, up more than 300 percent since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second straight year the House passed bankruptcy  
overhaul legislation. Last year, the administration threatened to 
veto a House-passed bill and the Senate adjourned without voting on 
the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislative action has come during a lobbying blitz by  
credit card companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies complain that too many people take shelter under  
the more lenient Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which 
erases debts, when they could afford to restructure debts according 
to a court-ordered plan under Chapter 13.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Seven hours of negotiations in London failed again  
Thursday to overcome the central dispute preventing Northern 
Ireland's Protestant-Catholic government from being formed -- the 
IRA's refusal to start surrendering its weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
	All the invited negotiators said they would meet again next week  
at British Prime Minister Tony Blair's Downing Street office. 
</P>
<P>
	They are trying to resolve an argument over whether the Irish  
Republican Army must start to disarm as a condition for the 
outlawed group's allied Sinn Fein party to take part in the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	``People want to see this chicken-and-egg situation resolved,''  
said Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble, the Protestant 
politician who would lead the 12-member government -- but who 
refuses to accept two Sinn Fein politicians as government 
colleagues unless the IRA first commits itself to disarming. 
</P>
<P>
	Sinn Fein's chairman, Mitchel McLaughlin, said the party's  
delegation had pressed Blair to force Trimble to form the 
government. But Trimble insists that move would only precipitate 
his ouster as Ulster Unionist leader in favor of a more hard-line 
figure. 
</P>
<P>
	Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern announced that many of his key  
advisers on Northern Ireland would remain in London this week to 
keep working alongside British government officials to draft 
various compromise proposals.

	Ahern said he didn't want the peace process to go on  
``drifting'' and expected some sort of conclusion within the next

	Northern Ireland's April 1998 peace accord envisioned that the  
government would be formed within six months, and that the IRA and 
outlawed pro-British paramilitary groups would have completely 
disarmed by May 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Blair and Ahern jointly proposed that Sinn Fein  
should be allowed to receive its two government posts if the IRA 
promised to start disarming within a month as part of a new

<HEADLINE> Churchill To Buy Hollywood Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Churchill Downs announced an agreement  
today to purchase Hollywood Park race track for $140 million, 
giving the Louisville track a foothold on both coasts while 
broadening its simulcast operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase of the southern California track follows Churchill  
Downs' purchase of Calder Racecourse in Miami for $86 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood Park officials said the deal would generate money for  
its expanding gaming interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, Churchill Downs will acquire 237 of Hollywood  
Park's 378 acres, which includes the Inglewood, Calif., track, 
other real estate around the track and a casino. Hollywood Park 
will lease the casino, a California card club, from Churchill Downs 
for $3 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is subject to approval by the California Horse Racing  
Board, and is expected to close in the third quarter of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood Park officials said some money from the sale will be  
used to develop its hotel and riverboat casino in Indiana, 
scheduled to open next year upstream from Louisville. Hollywood 
Park also will seek to develop the remaining 141 acres it will own 
at near the track, or field offers from potential buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This transaction is a major step toward the attainment of our  
corporate objective of focusing on the growth of our gaming 
businesses,'' said R.D. Hubbard, Hollywood Park's chief executive 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal with Churchill Downs also will ensure continued live  
racing at Hollywood Park, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Churchill Downs has racing and simulcast wagering operations at  
Ellis Park in Henderson, Hoosier Park in Anderson, Ind., as well as 
a minority interest in Kentucky Downs in Franklin. It also holds 
interests in various other racing services companies. Churchill 
Downs, home of the Kentucky Derby, is the company's flagship 
operation.

<HEADLINE> GOP Tries for Tax Relief in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Facing a money crunch, Republican senators  
Thursday began sorting through options for a phased-in package of 
targeted tax cuts as prospects dimmed for significant reductions in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike last year's ``April surprise,'' the Congressional Budget  
Office will not raise projections for this year's budget surplus 
until July 1 at the earliest, a spokesman said. That dashes GOP 
hopes for an immediate infusion of cash for election-year tax cuts, 
particularly important as Yugoslavia war costs rise. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's zip for 2000,'' said Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., a  
member of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Senate Republicans met behind closed doors  
Thursday to discuss proposals ranging from cuts in capital gains 
taxes to relief from the so-called marriage penalty in which many 
two-earner couples pay more income taxes than if single. 
</P>
<P>
	No final decisions were expected, but Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla.,  
said it was a chance for Republicans to ``share their views ... 
about what the plan ought to look like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., chairman of the Senate Budget  
Committee, said he told the group that tax relief totaling about 
$15 billion was possible for 2000. But others said it would be a 
mistake to concentrate on small-bore cuts and to push hard for a 
huge 10-year cut of nearly $800 billion, even if its full impact is 
delayed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to focus on the total amount, not a token tax cut,''  
said Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans began the year touting broad tax relief such as a 10  
percent across-the-board income tax cut, but there are now 
obstacles even to modest cuts. First, the budget surplus for the 
next few years is driven by Social Security funds, money both 
parties have promised not to touch. 
</P>
<P>
	There is also a reluctance to cut government programs already  
strapped by caps on spending and the unknown future costs of the 
conflict over Kosovo. But the GOP is determined not to give up on 
its signature political issue, even if a major tax cut must be 
phased in slowly over the next decade as the non-Social Security 
budget surplus grows. 
</P>
<P>
	They are scouring the budget for ways to offset the costs of tax  
relief in the early years, including serious consideration of 
President Clinton's proposals to close several corporate tax 
shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking to see where there are opportunities to raise  
revenues so we can give the working people a tax cut,'' said Sen. 
William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. 
``We want to give as large a tax cut as we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer,  
R-Texas, has asked the committee's members to each submit three tax 
relief ideas to lay groundwork for a tax bill likely to move 
through the panel in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Most lawmakers believe it will include several items that appeal  
to specific groups as well as extend popular expiring business 
provisions. Clinton took a similar approach in his tax plan with 
proposals such as credits for stay-at-home parents, breaks for the 
steel industry and credits for buyers of fuel-efficient cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Mack unveiled a bill Thursday that embraces several GOP  
priorities: phasing out estate taxes, cutting capital gains tax 
rates, increasing the standard income tax deduction for married 
couples and singles and making the soon-to-expire business research 
and development tax credit permanent. 
</P>
<P>
	Total cost over five years is roughly $140 billion -- partly  
because capital gains tax cuts actually raise money as investors 
sell more securities -- but it balloons to about $750 billion over 
10 years once all the provisions kick in. This will enable 
Republicans to say they are passing a monumental tax cut before the 
2000 elections, even if voters won't see all the results for years. 
</P>
<P>
	But it doesn't appear there will be much Democratic help in  
passing a GOP-crafted bill. ``I frankly doubt that we are likely to 
support what they're going to produce,'' said House Minority Leader 
Dick Gephardt, D-Mo.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Focusing on Fund Raising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Moving to politics after a focus on war,  
President Clinton is raising $700,000 from Democrats in Texas, a 
state whose Republican governor hopes to follow him to the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who returned Thursday evening from a fast-paced trip to  
Europe, was flying to Houston and Austin for a pair of fund-raisers 
for the Democratic National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was to speak at a lunch in a fashionable Houston  
restaurant where the minimum donation was $20,000 a couple. 
Expected tally: $450,000. 
</P>
<P>
	At an evening outdoor fiesta at a private home in Austin, the  
Democrats expected $250,000 in contributions from some 125 guests 
paying a minimum of $1,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president is a popular fund-raiser and is looking forward  
to being with our friends and supporters in Texas,'' said Peter 
Kaufman, a party spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Clinton plans to shift gears again, moving on to  
Oklahoma to view the devastation left in the state by furious 
tornadoes. 
</P>
<P>
	In Europe, Clinton got reports on the NATO bombing of  
Yugoslavia, offered thanks to U.S. pilots flying missions over the 
Balkan nation and met in Germany with ethnic Albanians who have 
fled Serbian ethnic cleansing in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there is a real peace process under way,'' Clinton  
said during a stop in Bonn for a meeting with German Chancellor 
Gerhard Schroeder. ``But it has no chance of reaching a 
satisfactory conclusion unless we maintain allied unity and 
firmness.''

<HEADLINE>  Holdsclaw Guided by Grandma's Love </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Chamique Holdslaw has gone from the projects of  
New York to Knoxville, Tenn. She's played in Canada, Brazil, 
Germany and Slovakia. 
</P>
<P>
	The next stop for the most decorated female basketball player  
since Cheryl Miller is Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's just fine with June Holdsclaw. She won't mind making  
the trip to watch her granddaughter play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was praying I wouldn't go to Utah,'' said Holdsclaw, the No.  
1 pick by the last-place Washington Mystics in the WNBA draft on 
Tuesday. ``(Washington) is where my grandmother wants me to play. 
It's only three hours away from home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	June Holdsclaw raised Chamique since her granddaughter was 11.  
Had Chamique joined the New York Liberty, her grandmother would 
have needed only a 20-minute taxi ride to Madison Square Garden. 
But Washington is close enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's the dream she's wanted (to play in New York),  
but she'll go where they send her,'' June said. ``I just hope she 
stays healthy and happy wherever she goes. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no place like playing in New York. This is her home.  
But Chamique likes to be by herself. It will be less stressful for 
her in Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The WNBA, unlike the NBA, does not allow the rights of a  
first-round pick to be traded to acquire a hometown favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	But basketball has sent Holdsclaw packing before. The  
21-year-old star honed her game in Astoria's playgrounds against 
NBA prospect Ron Artest. 
</P>
<P>
	She played on AAU teams, dazzled high school opponents and led  
Tennessee to three consecutive NCAA championships. Last summer, she 
helped the U.S. national team win a gold medal at the World 
Championships in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	Lately, she's been training with the national team in Colorado  
Springs, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Her grandmother will attend Chamique's professional debut  
against the Charlotte Sting in Washington on June 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``When she first went to Tennessee, I didn't go to the first  
game and that bothered me for a long time,'' June said. ``When she 
plays in Washington, I'll go back and forth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	June watched New York Liberty games last summer and knows  
Chamique faces more physical play in the 12-team WNBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those girls are so big, they're all pro players from  
overseas,'' June said. ``Chamique is so tiny, she's so skinny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 6-foot-2, the Olive Oil-like presence of Holdsclaw morphs  
into a silky all-court player who can dribble like a guard, hit a 
soft pullup jumper or fake a low-post defender for an easy layup. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamique, soft-spoken and confident, shares the quiet poise of  
her grandmother. She chose to live with June when her parents 
separated. Her 18-year-old brother Davon lives with their mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a very religious person, she has her priorities in  
order,'' Chamique said. ``A lot of times people say, `You act like 
a grandmother, you're just totally laid back, nothing bothers 
you.''' 
</P>
<P>
	June consoled Chamique after fouling out in the last game of her  
college career, a loss to Duke in the NCAA regional finals in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	With the defeat, Holdsclaw missed a chance to become the first  
player -- male or female -- to win four consecutive NCAA 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was crying so hard,'' June said. ``She was really out of  
it. That was the first time nobody stopped me from getting to the 
locker room and the press room. 
</P>
<P>
	``But she'll come up against harder things in life. I felt bad  
for her, but I told her, `You've been blessed. You played in four 
tournaments and you've always been a winner.''' 
</P>
<P>
	It marked Chamique's first significant defeat in eight years  
after leading Christ the King to four consecutive Catholic high 
school league championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The WNBA hopes the crossover appeal of Holdsclaw, who will make  
stops in 11 cities during the three-month summer season, causes a 
sensation among fans much like Michael Jordan did in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are players in sports who transcend the consciousness  
and it seems she has the potential to perhaps bring herself into 
that category, that very special class of athlete,'' WNBA president 
Val Ackerman said. 
</P>
<P>
	June Holdsclaw plans to follow her granddaughter's pro career  
full time when she retires from her medical records job at a Queens 
hospital in December. The 62-year-old woman will get a part-time 
job ``to stay busy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In between, she will impart wisdom to a granddaughter whose fame  
could earn her millions in endorsements in just her first year. 
</P>
<P>
	``From eighth grade to now, she was always a winner,'' June  
said. ``She just thought it always belonged to you. I told her 
`This is the real world now. You're not going to be under Pat 
(Summitt, the Tennessee coach). You have to learn a lot.'''

	Russia, NATO Agree on Kosovo Plan  
</P>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- Russia and Western powers agreed today on a  
common approach to seeking peace for Kosovo, including terms for an 
armed international force to secure the return of refugees. ``The 
Russians have accepted the proposition there needs to be a security 
presence on the ground in Kosovo,'' President Clinton's national 
security adviser, Sandy Berger, told reporters. Foreign ministers 
of the Group of Eight countries settled on a seven-point plan to be 
endorsed by the U.N. Security Council, German officials said. 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the security force 
``will have NATO at its core,'' adding that Russia will be ``part 
of it.''

	Clinton Meets Kosovo Refugees  
</P>
<P>
	INGELHEIM, Germany (AP) -- President Clinton comforted victims of  
ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, promising the refugees today: ``You 
will go home again in safety and in freedom.'' Clinton and German 
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder promised computer terminals at refugee 
centers to help track down lost relatives and ``so that you can 
constantly get news in your own language'' of the NATO effort to 
drive Serb forces from Kosovo. After an emotional discussion with 
refugees on a cluster of metal chairs, Clinton appealed to ethnic 
Albanians to resist hatred despite their plight.

	Steele's Defense Calls No Witnesses

	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- Julie Hiatt Steele's lawyers rested their  
case today without calling any witnesses, saying the prosecutors 
failed to show that her statements, even if false, had hindered 
Kenneth Starr's investigation of President Clinton. The surprise 
move came after defense lawyers unsuccessfully sought a mistrial, 
asking U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton to dismiss all three 
counts of obstruction of justice and the single count of making a 
false statement to the FBI.

the face, was granted parole today after nearly seven years in 
prison. Officials said she would be released within one week from 
Albion state prison where she is currently being held. ``She's been

program. Lawyers for the plaintiffs urged jurors yesterday to award 
$71.5 million in damages, saying the talk show and its corporate 
owner, Warner Bros., were liable for the shooting death of Scott 
Amedure. Amedure, who was gay, was killed after revealing his crush 
on another male guest. Eight of the nine jurors have to agree for a 
verdict.

	LINDEN, Tenn. (AP) -- Powerful storms blew through western  
Tennessee early today, closing schools, damaging buildings in 30 
counties and killing at least four people. In North Carolina, high 
winds downed trees and closed the high school in Asheville today. A 
tornado was spotted 14 miles south of Burnsville, but the National 
Weather Service received no reports of damage. Severe thunderstorms 
moved across north Georgia today, knocking out power to about 
10,000 in the Atlanta area and dumping hail and heavy rain on some 
areas.

	Retail Sales Strong in April  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sales at many of nation's biggest retailers  
soared to better-than-expected levels in April as the continued 
strength of the U.S. economy encouraged Americans to do lots of 
shopping last month. It was the third straight month of 
surprisingly strong sales, boding well for first-quarter earnings. 
A number of chains -- including the Limited and Ann Taylor -- have 
said they will top forecasts for the quarter. The big winners in 
April were specialty clothing chains.

<HEADLINE> Churchill Downs Buys Hollywood Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Think televised horse racing 24 hours a  
day. Think bettors sitting home at their computers, placing wagers 
on daily doubles at tracks from coast to coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeing dramatic changes on the horizon for the horse racing  
business, Churchill Downs is adding Hollywood Park to its string of 
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The future of racing has never been better since I've been  
involved than what it is going into the new century,'' R. D. 
Hubbard, who agreed to sell Hollywood Park for $140 million, said 
during a news conference Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the major contribution going into the new century is  
TVG and home wagering and a 24-hour racing channel, and the overall 
simulcasting that is spreading across the country. That fits in 
with the strategy of what Churchill is trying to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So why did Hubbard decide to sell?  
</P>
<P>
	``Our strategy has shifted to where we want to become a  
single-purpose, gaming casino company,'' he said. ``There has been 
some confusion on Wall Street, are we a racing company or are we a 
casino company? I think this pretty well clarifies that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Meeker, Churchill Down's president and chief operating  
officer, was pleased to be in the West Coast market. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are thrilled at the prospect of expanding our racing  
operations from coast to coast,'' he said. ``With the recent 
acquisition of Calder Race Course in Miami and now possibly the 
Hollywood Park race track in Southern California, Churchill Downs 
will be positioned to be the premier race track operator and 
simulcast broadcaster in the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Santa Anita, in the Los Angeles suburb of Arcadia, was sold last  
November to Canadian horse breeder and owner Frank Stronach, who 
paid $126 million for the track and 305 acres of land. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeker, noting that Hollywood Park was one of the few attractive  
racing facilities available, plans to put together a TV package. 
</P>
<P>
	``We control a lot of content right now. What we're trying to do  
is aggregate the quality products, and we're well down the road to 
getting that done,'' he said. ``Hopefully by the first quarter of 
next year, we will be able to unveil, in a coordinated way, our new 
simulcast programming. 
</P>
<P>
	``The programing we hope to provide to the industry is one that  
is not currently being provided, a program that has some continuity 
to it, high-quality production to it, and new features that make it 
much more user friendly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marketing has been scattered since individual track owners were  
making their own deals for simulcasts and so on. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to use a coordinated approach to bring our product to  
the marketplace,'' Meeker said. ``We hope to create a product that 
is much like ESPN is to cable operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is to say, if you're a cable operator delivering a cable  
system in a particular market, you will not be able to go into that 
cable system unless you have ESPN as part of that portfolio. If 
you're an OTB operator, you will not will be able to deliver your 
simulcast products unless you have the Churchill Downs simulcast 
network. That's our objective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase of Hollywood Park, which opened in 1938, follows  
Churchill Downs' purchase of Calder Racecourse in Miami for $86 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, which must be approved by the California Horse  
Racing Board and other regulatory agencies and is expected to close 
in the third quarter of this year, Churchill Downs will acquire 237 
of Hollywood Park's 378 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	Included are the track, the casino adjoining it, and other real  
estate around the track. Hubbard's company will keep the remaining 
acreage at the track and will lease the casino, a California card 
club, from Churchill Downs for $3 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbard plans to use the $140 million to develop a hotel and  
river boat casino in Indiana, scheduled to open next year upstream 
from Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
	His company also will seek to develop its remaining acreage  
around the track. Hubbard, who had sought to bring an NFL team to 
Hollywood Park, still did not rule out that possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Churchill Downs has racing and simulcast wagering operations at  
Ellis Park in Henderson, Ky., Hoosier Park in Anderson, Ind., as 
well as a minority interest in Kentucky Downs in Franklin. It also 
holds interests in various other racing services companies. 
Churchill Downs, home of the Kentucky Derby, is the company's 
flagship operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``In selecting Churchill (as the buyer), the main thing in  
addition to money was to assure that racing will continue to be 
viable here,'' said Hubbard, who will continue to be active as a 
horse owner. ``I can assure you that with Churchill, that will 
happen.''

<HEADLINE> Shot-Free Insulin Treatments Tested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers who tested more than 50,000  
natural and synthetic substances say they have found a fungus 
compound that acts like insulin, raising the possibility that 
diabetics in the future may take pills instead of shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists at Merck Research Laboratories isolated the  
insulin-like compound from a fungus found in the jungles of Congo 
in West Africa. When it was tested on mice that have diabetes, the 
researchers found that it significantly lowered the sugar in the 
animals' blood. The researchers said the compound is a mimic of 
insulin, the natural hormone that allows the body to metabolize 
sugar. 
</P>
<P>
	``This could potentially be used to replace insulin shots in  
diabetics,'' said Dr. Bei Zhang of Merck, the lead author of a 
study to be published Friday in the journal Science. She cautioned, 
however, that ``it is still very early,'' and that years of 
research remain before the compound could be tested in humans. 
</P>
<P>
	The compound, called L-783,281, was found by a team that  
laboriously tested 50,000 substances collected from around the 
world, checking each one for its ability to mimic the action of 
insulin. 
</P>
<P>
	L-783,281 was found to be promising in test tube studies, so the  
researchers carried it to the next step -- testing on animals. 
</P>
<P>
	Two strains of mice that naturally develop diabetes were treated  
with the compound and tests showed that L-783,281 helped the mouse 
cells to take glucose, or sugar, from the blood stream. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhang said the compound works in much the same way as insulin.  
L-783,281 links up with a specific molecule on the surface of each 
cell. This activates an enzyme that sets off a series of biological 
steps, enabling the cells to absorb and use sugar. 
</P>
<P>
	Diabetes is caused when the body is unable to make insulin, or  
becomes unable to use insulin properly. 
</P>
<P>
	People with Type I diabetes, the most serious form of the  
disease, may require up to four insulin shots a day to maintain the 
proper glucose level. Type I diabetes most commonly is diagnosed 
among children and young people. 
</P>
<P>
	In type II diabetes, which affects about 10 percent of Americans  
over the age of 40, patients are able to make insulin, but cells in 
the body become insensitive to the hormone. Type II diabetes 
usually is controlled by diet, weight loss and taking pills that 
improve the body's utilization of insulin. Some drugs recently 
approved by the Food and Drug Administration are for the treatment 
of Type II diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	All diabetic patients must frequently check glucose levels in  
their blood in order to properly control their disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhang said that, unlike insulin, L-783,281 can be taken as  
pills. The compound can be absorbed by the digestive system and 
still act on the cells of the body. Insulin is destroyed by 
digestion and, for this reason, must be given by injection, a 
regimen that is often difficult for patients to accept. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Robert Goldstein, vice president of research at the Juvenile  
Diabetes Foundation, said the discovery of L-783,281 ``is a real 
advance'' in diabetes research. 
</P>
<P>
	``It offers the promise of an alternative approach in which  
patients would not have to have insulin shots,'' he said. But 
Goldstein cautioned that a great deal more study is needed before 
L-783,281 could be safely tested on humans. 
</P>
<P>
	``This still needs a lot of work,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales Strong in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sales at many of nation's biggest retailers  
soared to better-than-expected levels in April as the continued 
strength of the U.S. economy encouraged Americans to do lots of 
shopping last month. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third straight month of surprisingly strong sales,  
boding well for first-quarter earnings. A number of chains -- 
including the Limited and Ann Taylor -- have said they will top 
forecasts for the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most Americans are working and feeling pretty good, and that  
is driving traffic into the stores,'' said Steve Paspal, senior 
retail analyst at Sovereign Asset Management, a subsidiary of John 
Hancock Funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The raging U.S. economy, combined with low unemployment and  
inflation levels has made consumers confident about their personal 
finances and has raised their eagerness to spend. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the stock market continues its record-setting pace,  
with the Dow Jones industrial average crossing the 11,000 mark 
earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The big winners in April were specialty clothing chains, while  
department stores also fared well. Discounters were strong, as 
shoppers turned to stores like Wal-Mart and Kmart for their wide 
selection and affordable prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the recent past, the discounters have been doing so much  
better than the department stores, but now I think that the 
department stores might be closing that gap a little thanks to 
strong demand for fashionable apparel,'' Paspal said. 
</P>
<P>
	The strength in sales came despite being compared with the  
stunning performance of April 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Some merchants -- including Dayton Hudson and the Gap -- were hurt  
by the early Easter holiday this year, which shifted most of the 
holiday buying into March rather than April. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite some hints of weakness, analysts remained confident that  
retailers would report healthy profit gains for the first quarter. 
Most will begin to release their earnings in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most retailers have had to make minimum markdowns to push out  
merchandise,'' said Walter Loeb, who runs the retail consulting 
firm Loeb Associates. ``I am very optimistic about this quarter and 
about the spring into summer season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Merrill Lynch retail index, the investment firm's barometer  
of sales performance at department stores and discount chains, was 
up 2.9 percent in April. It rose 8.4 percent in March and was up 
9.5 percent in April 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, reported sales from  
stores open at least a year rose 4.6 percent from a year earlier, 
while total sales were up 11.5 percent. Sales from stores open at 
least a year, known as same-store sales, are considered the most 
accurate measure of a retailer's strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Other retailers' reports:  
</P>
<P>
	--Sears: Same-store sales down 0.9 percent, total sales down 4.3  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Kmart: Same-store sales up 5.7 percent, total sales up 7.3  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--J.C. Penney: Same-store department store sales fell 0.2  
percent, same-store sales at Eckerd drugstores rose 7.7 percent, 
total sales rose 6.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dayton Hudson: Same-store sales down 1.3 percent, total sales  
up 2.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Federated: Same-store sales rose 1.5 percent, total sales up  
12.9 percent. Federated's total sales included revenues from the 
Internet and catalog seller Fingerhut, which it acquired in March. 
</P>
<P>
	--May Department Stores: Same-store sales up 7.7 percent, total  
sales up 12.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Limited: Same-store sales up 5 percent, total sales were flat.  
</P>
<P>
	--Gap: Same-store sales up 1 percent, total sales up 21 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Ann Taylor: Same-store sales up 10.3 percent, total sales up  
17.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Energy Boss Defends Administration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson acknowledged  
massive security breaches at nuclear weapons labs Thursday but said 
in an interview that criticism is ``starting to become a blame 
game'' that could hurt the labs and the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said an interview with The Associated Press that  
while he could not guarantee there would be no future security 
lapses at the government research labs, he is convinced the kind of 
failure now under investigation at the Los Alamos lab ``cannot 
occur with the measures we have taken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department recently ordered new procedures to guard  
against transfer of material from classified to unclassified 
computers, created additional ``firewalls'' to reduce hacker 
attacks on its computer systems and began more extensive monitoring 
of e-mail. In April the labs' computer systems were shut down for 
two weeks to integrate the new security measures. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't admit perfection has been achieved, but I can be  
confident to say we've taken bold, dramatic steps to greatly 
improve the prospects that there would not be any future security 
lapses,'' said Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	Wen Ho Lee, the Taiwan-born scientist at Los Alamos whose firing  
March 8 exposed the security breaches, denied again Friday in a 
statement through his attorney having ``given classified computer 
files to any unauthorized person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``No third party could have or did access his protected computer  
files,'' Lee's attorney, Mark Holscher, said in a six-page 
statement reported by the Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post 
in its Friday editions. 
</P>
<P>
	In the statement, Holscher portayed Lee, who work at Los Alamos  
involved computer simulations of nuclear explosions, and his wife 
as ``loyal Americans'' who did undercover work for the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Lee was dispatched by the FBI to the government's  
Lawrence Livermore laboratory near San Francisco in 1982 to meet 
with a scientist ``who was rumored to be facing disciplinary action 
for delivering a scientific paper in Taiwan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And between 1985 and 1991 Mrs. Lee would write reports for the  
FBI and hand over any correspondence she or her husband received 
from Chinese scientists resulting from attending scientific 
conferences in Beijing. The Times said the FBI ended the 
relationship in 1991 after deciding that she was giving it the same 
information she had already given Los Alamos officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee has not been charged with any crime. He remains under  
investigation for allegedly transferring hundreds of top-secret 
nuclear warhead performance codes from a secure computer system to 
his unsecure desktop computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Holscher did not address the computer transfers in the statement  
and government officials have said they have no evidence that any 
of the secret codes reached people outside Los Alamos. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 45-minute discussion in his office at the Energy  
Department, Richardson defended the administration's response to 
security concerns and espionage at the weapons labs and said: 
</P>
<P>
	--The security breaches at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in  
New Mexico, including the transfer of massive amounts of weapons 
computer codes to an unsecure desktop computer was ``an 
unacceptable, intolerable security breach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--That he was not ``personally aware of any other serious''  
security violations like the one under investigation at Los Alamos 
at any of the labs. 
</P>
<P>
	--There is no evidence that China or any other country obtained  
any of the computer design and performance codes that had been 
moved from the secure computer system, but that one should ``assume 
the worst' and take ``draconian measures'' to avoid a repeat 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said that both Republican and Democratic  
administrations have made missteps when it comes to security at the 
federal weapons research labs including Los Alamos in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's plenty of blame to share,'' said Richardson.  
</P>
<P>
	``We should concentrate on reforming the (security) system  
rather than destroying it for political gain,'' said Richardson. 
``It's starting to become a political issue. ... It is taking on a 
political life of its own that's only going to hurt the labs and 
the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Some are trying to say we reacted much too slowly on cyber  
security. I reject that,'' said Richardson. He said he did not want 
to dwell ``on what happened in the past'' and ``concentrate on what 
we've done to fix the problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least 10 congressional committees are looking into how the  
Clinton administration responded to allegations of lax security at 
weapons labs and the discovery in 1996 of a major theft of secrets 
by China at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. The theft took 
place in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, some Republican lawmakers compared the Los  
Alamos case to the Julius and Ethel Rosenberg spy case in the 1950s 
and the more recent spy saga involving CIA agent Aldrich Ames. 
Referring to the possible security damage at Los Alamos, Sen. Don 
Nickles, R-Okla., suggested it might be the most damaging case of 
espionage in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's an exaggeration,'' said Richardson. ``The scope, the  
extent of the theft has not been determined. The breach was 
serious,'' he continued. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, said Richardson ``there's no evidence that China or  
anybody else got any of these (computer codes). Before we start 
panicking, we need more facts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said he was concerned that several moves underway in  
Congress to restrict or even ban foreign scientific exchanges at 
labs or to have the FBI take over lab security are unnecessary and 
an overreaction.

<HEADLINE> AmeriCorps Has Serious Money Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite some progress, serious financial  
management problems still hamper the Corporation for National 
Service, which runs President Clinton's AmeriCorps program, 
auditors told a House panel Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is still pretty ugly,'' remarked Rep. Peter Hoekstra,  
R-Mich., after hearing the conclusions of Luise Jordan, the 
corporation's inspector general, and Karyn Molnar, a partner in the 
accounting firm of KPMG LLP. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is progress but we haven't solved the problem,'' said  
Hoekstra, chairman of the House Education Committee's oversight and 
investigations panel, which held a hearing on an audit of the 
corporation's statements for fiscal 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan said the audit cited eight areas of the agency's  
financial operations as being ``materially weak,'' including its 
financial management and reporting, its financial systems and the 
management of millions of dollars in grants. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous audits identified six such areas, she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Also, until last year, the corporation could not even produce  
financial statements suitable for auditing. 
</P>
<P>
	The corporation received $714 million this year. Its programs  
include AmeriCorps, which enlists ordinary citizens for community 
service projects nationwide. Young adults get college tuition 
assistance in return. 
</P>
<P>
	Under questioning, Molnar said some of the problems are linked  
to the lack of strong financial management. The agency lost its 
chief financial officer and its deputy CFO last year; neither has 
been replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	``It cannot be overemphasized how important strong financial  
management is,'' Molnar said, adding that filling the CFO post is 
``the most important thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris Wofford, the former Pennsylvania senator who heads the  
organization, said he expected the White House to nominate a 
candidate for the top financial slot in about six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Wofford said the agency has made steady progress in recent years  
and was ``within striking distance'' of solving its outstanding 
financial management issues. But installation of a new program to 
modernize accounting and funds control has been delayed until July 
to minimize disruptions and to permit certain grants to get out on 
time, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoekstra said that showed that officials were not serious about  
getting the corporation's financial house in order. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is unacceptable,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Air Force To Review Failed Launches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Air Force today said it will convene a  
special review of the recent string of failed Titan IV rocket 
launches that have set back its space satellite programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Acting Air Force Secretary F. Whitten Peters said the review  
will be done jointly with the National Reconnaissance Office, which 
operates the government's military and intelligence satellite 
programs, and will recommend changes in practices and procedures to 
``assure continued access to space for the Defense Department.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last Friday, a Titan IV rocket left a military communications  
satellite in an orbit thousands of miles too low. And on April 9, a 
missile-warning satellite ended up in a useless orbit following its 
launch aboard a Titan IV, which is built by Lockheed Martin Corp. A 
Titan IV also failed in August 1998.

<HEADLINE>  Rugova Release May Affect NATO Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- President Slobodan Milosevic's decision  
to let Kosovo's most prominent ethnic Albanian leader leave the 
country may be the most critical development yet affecting NATO's 
strategy of using force to impose a settlement in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Ibrahim Rugova arrived Wednesday in Rome along with his family.  
Rugova was elected president of the unrecognized Republic of Kosovo 
by ethnic Albanians who rejected Milosevic's heavy-handed rule in 
Kosovo, a Serb province with an ethnic Albanian majority. 
</P>
<P>
	Presumably, the 54-year-old intellectual is now free to speak  
freely about how he believes the crisis should be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	If Rugova repeats statements attributed to him while he remained  
in Yugoslavia, it will undermine the Western strategy of using NATO 
planes and missiles to force Milosevic to settle the crisis on 
Western terms and enable an estimated 700,000 ethnic Albanian 
refugees to return home. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, if he repudiates those statements and  
endorses the NATO strategy, it would silence critics in the West 
and stiffen Western resolve to pursue the air campaign. It would 
also allay concerns among the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army that 
Rugova has sold out to the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first news conference, held today in Rome, Rugova avoided  
saying whether he supported the NATO bombing campaign or whether 
meetings he had with Serb leaders had been held under duress. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he endorsed U.S. calls for NATO participation in an  
international peacekeeping force for Kosovo and also for the 
withdrawal of Serb forces so that all ethnic Albanian refugees 
could return safely. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Yugoslav media reported that Rugova and Serbia's  
president, Milan Milutinovic, signed a joint statement calling for 
an immediate resumption of talks between Serbian government and 
ethnic Albanian political leaders on a settlement granting ``wide 
self-rule'' with ``full equality'' for all in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement also called for an end to NATO bombing, although  
for weeks before the March 24 air campaign began, Rugova -- a 
lifelong pacifist -- had been urging Western military intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	Western and NATO officials have discounted the joint  
declaration, claiming Rugova and his family were under house arrest 
in the Kosovo capital of Pristina and that such statements were 
probably made under duress. 
</P>
<P>
	If Rugova were to repeat a call for an end to the bombing  
campaign, it would have a major impact, since the stated purpose of 
the Western air assault is to protect and defend the very people 
whom many Western governments believe he represents. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps because of the uncertainty of where Rugova stands, State  
Department spokesman James Foley reacted to news of his appearance 
in Italy positively but with restraint. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very glad he was able to leave,'' Foley said. ``It's a  
positive development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Washington considers Rugova the leader of the ethnic  
Albanians, Foley replied simply: ``That's for the Kosovars to 
decide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting with Milutinovic, however, followed talks between  
Rugova and Milosevic on April 1. That led to suspicion among some 
Kosovo Albanians that Rugova may have been willing to deal with the 
Milosevic government, perhaps trying to spare his people further 
suffering or enhance his own position against militant rivals in 
his community. 
</P>
<P>
	Baton Haxhiu, chief editor of Kosovo's Koha Ditore newspaper,  
told reporters Wednesday that Rugova ``has been brought'' to Italy 
to unveil a ``compromise'' peace plan worked out with Milosevic.

<HEADLINE>  Holdsclaw Guided by Grandma's Love </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Chamique Holdslaw has gone from the projects of  
New York to Knoxville, Tenn. She's played in Canada, Brazil, 
Germany and Slovakia. 
</P>
<P>
	The next stop for the most decorated female basketball player  
since Cheryl Miller is Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's just fine with June Holdsclaw. She won't mind making  
the trip to watch her granddaughter play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was praying I wouldn't go to Utah,'' said Holdsclaw, the No.  
1 pick by the last-place Washington Mystics in the WNBA draft on 
Tuesday. ``(Washington) is where my grandmother wants me to play. 
It's only three hours away from home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	June Holdsclaw raised Chamique since her granddaughter was 11.  
Had Chamique joined the New York Liberty, her grandmother would 
have needed only a 20-minute taxi ride to Madison Square Garden. 
But Washington is close enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's the dream she's wanted (to play in New York),  
but she'll go where they send her,'' June said. ``I just hope she 
stays healthy and happy wherever she goes. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no place like playing in New York. This is her home.  
But Chamique likes to be by herself. It will be less stressful for 
her in Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The WNBA, unlike the NBA, does not allow the rights of a  
first-round pick to be traded to acquire a hometown favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	But basketball has sent Holdsclaw packing before. The  
21-year-old star honed her game in Astoria's playgrounds against 
NBA prospect Ron Artest. 
</P>
<P>
	She played on AAU teams, dazzled high school opponents and led  
Tennessee to three consecutive NCAA championships. Last summer, she 
helped the U.S. national team win a gold medal at the World 
Championships in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	Lately, she's been training with the national team in Colorado  
Springs, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Her grandmother will attend Chamique's professional debut  
against the Charlotte Sting in Washington on June 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``When she first went to Tennessee, I didn't go to the first  
game and that bothered me for a long time,'' June said. ``When she 
plays in Washington, I'll go back and forth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	June watched New York Liberty games last summer and knows  
Chamique faces more physical play in the 12-team WNBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those girls are so big, they're all pro players from  
overseas,'' June said. ``Chamique is so tiny, she's so skinny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 6-foot-2, the Olive Oil-like presence of Holdsclaw morphs  
into a silky all-court player who can dribble like a guard, hit a 
soft pullup jumper or fake a low-post defender for an easy layup. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamique, soft-spoken and confident, shares the quiet poise of  
her grandmother. She chose to live with June when her parents 
separated. Her 18-year-old brother Davon lives with their mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a very religious person, she has her priorities in  
order,'' Chamique said. ``A lot of times people say, `You act like 
a grandmother, you're just totally laid back, nothing bothers 
you.''' 
</P>
<P>
	June consoled Chamique after fouling out in the last game of her  
college career, a loss to Duke in the NCAA regional finals in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	With the defeat, Holdsclaw missed a chance to become the first  
player -- male or female -- to win four consecutive NCAA 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was crying so hard,'' June said. ``She was really out of  
it. That was the first time nobody stopped me from getting to the 
locker room and the press room. 
</P>
<P>
	``But she'll come up against harder things in life. I felt bad  
for her, but I told her, `You've been blessed. You played in four 
tournaments and you've always been a winner.''' 
</P>
<P>
	It marked Chamique's first significant defeat in eight years  
after leading Christ the King to four consecutive Catholic high 
school league championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The WNBA hopes the crossover appeal of Holdsclaw, who will make  
stops in 11 cities during the three-month summer season, causes a 
sensation among fans much like Michael Jordan did in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are players in sports who transcend the consciousness  
and it seems she has the potential to perhaps bring herself into 
that category, that very special class of athlete,'' WNBA president 
Val Ackerman said. 
</P>
<P>
	June Holdsclaw plans to follow her granddaughter's pro career  
full time when she retires from her medical records job at a Queens 
hospital in December. The 62-year-old woman will get a part-time 
job ``to stay busy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In between, she will impart wisdom to a granddaughter whose fame  
could earn her millions in endorsements in just her first year. 
</P>
<P>
	``From eighth grade to now, she was always a winner,'' June  
said. ``She just thought it always belonged to you. I told her 
`This is the real world now. You're not going to be under Pat 
(Summitt, the Tennessee coach). You have to learn a lot.'''

<HEADLINE> Firm Settles Web Child-Privacy Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The operator of a ``Young Investor'' Web site  
has settled government charges that it collected personal 
information from children without parental consent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission said Thursday that Liberty  
Financial Companies Inc. deceived visitors to its site by saying 
that personal information from an Internet survey, including 
details of the child's and family's finances, would be kept 
anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
	But according to the commission, the company -- which runs the  
Young Investor site -- also asked children for personal information 
such as name, address, age and e-mail address in order to send them 
newsletters and make them eligible for prizes. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, therefore, had identifying information and did not  
keep the details received from the survey anonymously, the FTC 
alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	Liberty Financial, based in Boston, denied that it made use of  
the information from the survey. 
</P>
<P>
	``At no time did our company ever compromise child privacy,''  
said Hal Thayer, a spokesman for Liberty Financial. ``We never used 
the information for our purposes, nor have we shared such 
information with any other entity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed agreement, Liberty Financial would be barred  
from misrepresenting its collection or use of personal information 
such as name, address, telephone number and e-mail address obtained 
from children under the age of 18. 
</P>
<P>
	It would also be required to post a privacy notice on its  
children's sites and obtain verifiable parental consent before 
collecting personal identifying information from children under 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Thayer said that because of increasing concerns about privacy,  
Liberty Financial has stopped collecting identifying information 
from its site. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the commission, the site included a ``Measure Up  
Survey,'' where children could answer questions on such subjects as 
their weekly allowance; whether they received financial gifts like 
stocks, bonds and mutual funds; and family finances. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey expressly stated at the top that all answers would be  
anonymous, the FTC said. But it included questions for children to 
become eligible for prizes and to receive newsletters. The 
commission said the prizes and contests were used to appeal to 
children, but the company never actually selected winners for the 
prizes or sent out the newsletters. 
</P>
<P>
	Thayer called this an administrative error and said prize  
winners have collected their rewards. The newsletter has now been 
incorporated into the Web site itself, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission said the order followed the requirements  
established by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, passed 
by Congress last year.

	SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) -- A group of Springfield ministers says  
white supremacists have been passing off their annual convention in 
the area as religion for too many years, and they've had enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than organizing a demonstration, they're trying to  
undermine the meeting by asking area hotel and convention 
facilities to turn away the group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saying nothing gives them the idea of acceptance ... If  
they've been coming back, they must feel acceptance,'' said Mike 
Adamek of First Unitarian Universalist Church. 
</P>
<P>
	Making the convention feel unwelcome won't be easy. It is  
organized by Everett Ramsey, pastor of Faith Baptist Church in 
Houston, Mo., who says there's no reason to worry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been there seven years and never had any trouble. We're  
nothing but a Baptist group. I have nothing else to say,'' said 
Ramsey. 
</P>
<P>
	However, national organizations that monitor extremist activity  
claim Ramsey's church is a hate group and belongs to the Christian 
Identity movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Devin Burghart, director of a center in Oak Park, Ill., which  
monitors and reports on organized hate groups, said Christian 
Identity has about 25,000 members nationwide who believe Jews are 
satanic and nonwhites are inferior. Many of the speakers expected 
at Ramsey's convention have Christian Identity ties, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Burghart suggested ministers educate their congregations about  
the group and organize against the meeting in mid-May. Such 
tactics, he said, kept a similar meeting from taking place in 
Quincy, Ill., in March.

 *Bishops' letter urging better care for river    	
</P>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Roman Catholic bishops are weighing in on the  
debate over the Columbia River and its resources. 
</P>
<P>
	The bishops, whose territory covers the Columbia River  
watershed, are writing a pastoral letter urging people to be better 
caretakers of the river. 
</P>
<P>
	Pastoral letters are rare. In the past, they've been written on  
issues like war, peace, homosexuality and poverty in America. 
</P>
<P>
	``The time has come for us to do this,'' said Bishop Carlos  
Sevilla of Yakima. ``They're talking about breaching dams and 
commercializing the Hanford Reach... .'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter, to be released this month, emphasizes the river's  
position as the spiritual lifeblood of the region, not as the 
economic workhorse it has become. It is earning praise simply for 
putting a fresh perspective into the lengthy debate over water 
quality and salmon health. 
</P>
<P>
	John Harrison, information officer for the Northwest Planning  
Power Council, welcomes it. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot in the Bible about protecting what's good and  
what God gave us,'' he said. ``If the church really has something 
to say here, about the cultural conflicts as well as the 
environmental crisis, it puts a different spin on it... .'' 
</P>
<P>
	James Anderson, a University of Washington fisheries professor,  
also says the bishops' approach is different. 
</P>
<P>
	``We usually just focus on the science, but it's becoming a  
question of community values. To me the most interesting question 
now is how we can blend science with advocacy, with our emotional 
and intuitive sense of what we want for the future.'' 
</P>

 *For Vietnamese, a church of their own    	
</P>
<P>
	EASTPOINTE, Mich. (AP) -- Vietnamese Catholics have more than a  
place of worship in a new church in suburban Detroit. They also 
have a place to share their experiences, which for many are stories 
of their escape from Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	Ypsilanti autoworker Kiem Hoang says as a boy in Vietnam he  
would walk his blind grandmother to the local Catholic church every 
morning before school. After fleeing Vietnam in 1975 and arriving 
in the United States, the church helped his family find jobs and 
housing and to learn English. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been a big part of my life,'' said Hoang, 38. ``Now I'm  
trying to make my children understand the religion and culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoang was among hundreds of worshippers at the recent formal  
opening of Our Lady of Grace Church in Eastpointe, the first 
Vietnamese Catholic Church in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels good to be in your own home,'' Father Vincent Nguyen  
An Ninh told the Detroit Free Press. ``It gives the Vietnamese 
community, not only Catholics, a face here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The majority of Vietnamese are Buddhist. But in the United  
States, about 25 percent practice Catholicism, which was introduced 
to Vietnam by a French missionary in the 17th century. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the Vietnamese Catholics were anti-Communists and fled,  
beginning with South Vietnam's fall in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	There are now about 10,000 Vietnamese in Michigan.

<HEADLINE>  Death Toll Rises After Tornadoes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Wearing hand-me-down clothes and driving  
borrowed cars, residents struggled to put their lives back together 
Thursday from the ruins of this week's twisters. The death toll, 
meanwhile, rose to 46 in Oklahoma and Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimberly Taylor wore a plaid overshirt, striped T-shirt and blue  
sweatpants as she collected clothes for her six children at a Del 
City church. She laughed at her mismatched outfit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our house was destroyed,'' she said. ``I don't have a car to  
even drive around in. Everything is just borrowed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 3,000 homes and businesses were destroyed in  
Oklahoma. About 1,500 buildings were destroyed in Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	The smell of hamburgers and sauteed onions wafted down one  
ravaged street in Moore, where volunteers served up free meals to 
residents picking through the ruins of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Bulmer, a pastor at Oakcrest Church of Christ, handed out  
sandwiches, water and gloves to people with nothing left. Some were 
so grateful, they were speechless, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of times we have to insist they take things,'' he said.  
``These are proud people. They're not used to being on the 
receiving end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Incredible stories of survival came from hospital beds Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	Angie Todd, her face swollen and bruised, had a broken shoulder,  
a shattered hand and a finger that will probably have to be 
amputated. The 29-year-old woman, her boyfriend and young son 
survived after being pulled from their bathroom and tossed four or 
five houses down the street. 
</P>
<P>
	``I actually remember being in the funnel of the tornado,'' Ms.  
Todd said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the injured died overnight, bringing the number of dead  
from Monday's tornadoes in Oklahoma to 41. Five people died in 
Kansas. About 750 people in Oklahoma and 150 in Kansas were 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The phone at the Oklahoma Medical Examiner's Office continued to  
ring with calls from people worried about relatives unaccounted for 
since the storms. Fifty-four people were on the missing person's 
list Thursday morning, but the number dropped as loved ones were 
located safe and sound during the day, spokesman Ray Blakeney said. 
Searchers have combed devastated neighborhoods with dogs and 
infrared devices. 
</P>
<P>
	James Scarberry, 30, driving a pickup truck lent by a co-worker,  
felt lucky to have found his wallet and ATM card under the bed in 
what was left of his bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess you don't realize everything you're missing until you  
have to look for it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Masteller stood on top of her house, now 2 feet tall, in a  
T-shirt, jeans and shoes that were obviously too big for her. She 
wore an old pair of flowered-rimmed glasses that her son pulled 
from the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is all I've got,'' she said, tugging at the shirt. ``I  
don't have credit cards. I don't have a checking book. Not even my 
wedding ring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The school system in the suburb of Moore, which lost an  
elementary school and a high school, said classes will resume on 
Monday. The 2,200 displaced students will finish the last two weeks 
of school at a nearby college, another elementary school and an old 
administration building. 
</P>
<P>
	The storms damaged or destroyed the homes of at least 1,500  
students and those of nearly 100 teachers and administrators, 
district spokeswoman Susan Pierce said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel strongly that in a time of crisis, one thing the  
school can offer is routine, stability and structure in the school 
day,'' she said. ``It's important for those students who have 
suffered a great loss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Vice President Al Gore toured the tornado damage in  
Haysville, Kan., and hugged people who lost their homes. He said 
the Labor Department will spend $5.7 million to help clean up the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	Victims of the storm were remembered Thursday during a ceremony  
at the Oklahoma Capitol to observe the National Day of Prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been through many devastating things,'' Lt. Gov. Mary  
Fallin said. ``This is a time Oklahoma can be revived. It's a time 
when Oklahoma can be renewed.''

<HEADLINE> Brewery Workers Sue on Drug Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Workers at the Anheuser-Busch brewery here  
have mounted a legal challenge over whether their bosses can clip 
locks of their hair to test for evidence of drug use. 
</P>
<P>
	Teamsters Local 102, which represents 900 employees, has sued  
St. Louis-based Anheuser-Busch, arguing that the nation's largest 
brewer has no right to collect such bodily samples. The lawsuit 
also challenges the accuracy and constitutionality of the hair 
analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute coincides with an ongoing contract impasse at the  
plant. The deadlock has led to the company imposing its final 
contract offer, which includes the new drug testing program. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Court Judge John Lifland last week in Newark  
denied the brewer's attempt to have the case moved from state court 
to federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those angered by the drug testing policy are veteran  
machinist Frederick Wedekin, who recently submitted a tiny portion 
of his hair to avoid the risk of dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never had anybody cut my hair without my permission  
unless it was my mother and father when I was a young kid,'' 
Wedekin, 53, of Belleville, told The Star-Ledger for Thursday's 
editions. ``I felt violated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another worker shaved off all of his body hair in protest, the  
newspaper reported. Technicians had to clip off a fingernail sample 
to complete his drug test. 
</P>
<P>
	Anheuser-Busch formerly required a urine test, the method still  
used by more than 90 percent of firms that test for illegal drugs 
such as marijuana and cocaine, according to the American Management 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts in hair analysis said companies using the method for  
drug testing include General Motors and casino operators in Las 
Vegas and Atlantic City. Officials at Psychemedics Corp., based in 
Cambridge, Mass., said they provide the service for more than 1,500 
corporate clients, including Anheuser-Busch -- plus some police 
departments, Federal Reserve banks, hospitals and universities. 
</P>
<P>
	Local 102 chief executive officer Jack Riley said the union  
hopes to stage a nationwide protest against the hair tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not going to accept this lying down,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Anheuser-Busch officials said they believe in the reliability of  
the hair samples. Evidence of drug use can remain in hair for 
months, proponents of the test argue. Urine tests generally detect 
drugs used only in the previous few hours or days. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Schmitz, Anheuser-Busch's vice president for labor  
relations, said accurate drug testing is important because brewery 
employees work with heavy machinery and dangerously hot liquids. 
</P>
<P>
	Union officials in Newark said at least two workers were  
discharged after testing positive for drugs since February.

<HEADLINE> Ways to Avoid Baby Snatching </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With 13 newborns abducted from hospitals in  
the last few years, an oversight commission is suggesting ways to 
prevent future snatchings, including ending birth announcements in 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	Better ID badges and color photos of newborns would also help,  
the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospital Organizations 
says in a special alert being sent this week to nearly 1,500 
hospitals nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time we're able to spot a trend or a pattern, we want to  
alert the health care community so we can prevent tragedies,'' said 
Janet McIntyre, a commission spokeswoman. ``Something like an 
infant abduction is always a high profile case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission began issuing these special alerts in February  
1998, and has sent only a few. It bases its recommendations on 
investigations hospitals are required to conduct after something 
goes wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Hospital Association welcomed the recommendations.  
</P>
<P>
	``When these things happen you try to figure out what happened  
and try to prevent this from happening again. You have to find a 
way to learn,'' said spokesman Rick Wade. ``That's the way it's 
supposed to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In reviewing eight recent abductions, the commission found that  
all of them involved female abductors in hospitals with unmonitored 
access to elevators or stairwells near the postpartum or nursery 
areas. They all occurred in midsize or large hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission recommended:  
</P>
<P>
	--Educating the staff on how to spot potential abductors and what  
to do if there is a snatching. 
</P>
<P>
	--Increasing parent education about abduction risks.  
</P>
<P>
	--Attaching bands to baby, mother, father or significant other  
immediately after birth. 
</P>
<P>
	--Footprinting babies, taking color photos and recording babies'  
physical exams within two hours of birth. 
</P>
<P>
	--Requiring staff to wear up-to-date and conspicuous ID badges  
with color photos. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of abductions has dropped in recent years. There were  
104 from 1983 through early this year -- an average of 15 per year -- 
with 98 babies found and six still missing, according to the 
National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. There were 13 
abductions total in 1996, 1997 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half were taken from the mother's room. Of the rest,  
about 15 percent each were taken from the nursery, the pediatrics 
department and from unspecified places on the premises. 
</P>
<P>
	Wherever they occur, the snatchings are likely to stir interest:  
</P>
<P>
	--Last July, a woman disguised as a nurse abducted a newborn baby  
girl from a Jacksonville, Fla., hospital just hours after her 
birth. The parents thought the woman was a hospital employee and 
let her help care for the baby. 
</P>
<P>
	--In January 1998, a woman entered a new mother's hospital room  
in Kansas City, Kan., to tell her of a drawing for free baby 
clothes. After a brief conversation, the mother fell asleep and the 
woman stole the newborn. 
</P>
<P>
	--In Lakewood, Wash., a 2-day-old baby boy was abducted from a  
hospital in 1997 by a woman who walked in wearing a white lab coat 
and took the child from his mother's arms.

<HEADLINE>  Jury Gets Marine Pilot Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- Prosecutors accused a Marine pilot  
Thursday of knowing full well that a tape he helped get rid of was 
going to be destroyed to impede an investigation into an air 
accident that killed 20 people in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who in this situation had the most to gain to make sure there  
wasn't any information about this flight?'' said prosecutor Maj. 
Daniel Daugherty in his closing statement at Capt. Richard Ashby's 
trial. ``He handed over that tape knowing it was going to be 
destroyed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby's lawyer, Frank Spinner, said Ashby had no criminal intent  
but had ``exercised poor judgment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the judge, Col. Alvin Keller, spent an hour instructing  
jurors, who will begin deliberating Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury must decide whether Ashby, 32, of Mission Viejo,  
Calif., is guilty of obstruction of justice and conspiracy. If 
convicted, he could be sent to prison for up to 10 years or 
dismissed from the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby was acquitted of manslaughter charges by a separate jury  
in March. If acquitted of these charges, he would start F-18 
fighter jet training. 
</P>
<P>
	After the jet hit the cable and landed, Ashby put the tape in  
his flight suit pocket. He retrieved it a few days later, wanting 
to see what was on it, he testified, but couldn't find a video 
player and handed it over to the navigator, Capt. Joseph 
Schweitzer, 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer, who was convicted of the charges Ashby faces and was  
kicked out of the Marines, said he threw the tape into a bonfire. 
Schweitzer said he feared that the tape, which included images of 
his face, would be played in the Italian media with scenes of the 
carnage.

convicted, he could be sent to prison for up to 10 years or 
dismissed from the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby was acquitted of manslaughter charges by a separate jury  
in March. If acquitted of these charges, he would start F-18 
fighter jet training. 
</P>
<P>
	After the jet hit the cable and landed, Ashby put the tape in  
his flight suit pocket. He retrieved it a few days later, wanting 
to see what was on it, he testified, but couldn't find a video 
player and handed it over to the navigator, Capt. Joseph 
Schweitzer, 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer, who was convicted of the charges Ashby faces and was  
kicked out of the Marines, said he threw the tape into a bonfire. 
Schweitzer said he feared that the tape, which included images of 
his face, would be played in the Italian media with scenes of the 
carnage.

<HEADLINE> WTO Still Seeks Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The World Trade Organization tried to break a  
deadlock today on whether a former prime minister from New Zealand 
or his rival from Thailand should be its new director-general. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the two rivals met for the fourth time since  
Italy's Renato Ruggiero vacated the post last Friday, a year after 
he announced his intention to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	A prolonged leadership vacuum could damage the WTO's efforts to  
mediate high-profile trade disputes and prepare for a November 
summit in Seattle to lower barriers to exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Former New Zealand Premier Mike Moore looked set to win last  
week after the diplomat conducting the selection process ruled out 
Thai Deputy Premier Supachai Panitchpakdi. 
</P>
<P>
	But Supachai's supporters, led by Japan and the Association of  
Southeast Asian Nations, refused to concede defeat. Saying the 
consultation process was flawed, they questioned the authority of 
Tanzanian Ambassador Ali Mchumo to exclude a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Supachai supporters say more than 50 members of the 134-nation  
WTO are holding out for the Thai candidate. Kenya has proposed that 
Mchumo try to reach a consensus around Supachai. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore's supporters, which include the United States and many  
Latin American countries, said they still believe consensus around 
their candidate is possible and called for Supachai to withdraw 
with dignity. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know that any time with 134 members, it takes time to  
build consensus, and we are on our way,'' U.S. trade ambassador 
Rita Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO has appointed David Hartridge, head of its services  
division, as acting director, but only to handle routine matters.

<HEADLINE> Amy Fisher Gets Parole After 7 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Amy Fisher, the ``Long Island Lolita'' who  
shot her lover Joey Buttafuoco's wife, was paroled Thursday after 
serving more than six years in prison in a case that became a font 
of tabloid stories and TV movies. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Parole Board voted 2-1 to free Ms. Fisher, 24, who  
will be released within a week and live in the New York City area, 
parole board spokesman Thomas Grant said. An assistant to Ms. 
Fisher's lawyer said she has a job lined up in the fashion 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fisher pleaded guilty in 1992 to assault and was sentenced  
to five to 15 years in prison for shooting Mary Jo Buttafuoco in 
the head. Mrs. Buttafuoco, then 37, survived. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fisher, then 17, had been having an affair with Buttafuoco,  
the 38-year-old owner of an auto body shop. He pleaded guilty to 
statutory rape and served six months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buttafuocos now live in Los Angeles, where Buttafuoco has  
been a cable television talk show host and is pursuing an acting 
career. A publicist for the couple had no comment on the parole 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Ms. Fisher apologized to Mrs. Buttafuoco, who  
forgave her. The two had corresponded for several months. With the 
support of prosecutors and Mrs. Buttafuoco, a judge reduced Ms. 
Fisher's sentence to 3 1/2 to 10 1/2 years, making her immediately 
eligible for parole. 
</P>
<P>
	She will be on parole until 2003.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fisher's mother, Rose Fisher, said in a statement that she  
had ``prayed and waited for this moment to arrive. Knowing my 
daughter is coming home is the best Mother's Day gift I could wish 
for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She added: ``I am looking forward to holding her in my arms,  
telling her I love her, and getting started on the rest of our 
lives together.''

<HEADLINE> Four Americans in Diving Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Mark Ruiz, coming off the first  
four gold-medal performance in national competition, qualified 
fourth today for the men's 3-meter finals in the USA Diving Grand 
Prix. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruiz was the highest-finishing American diver, qualifying behind  
China's Xiong Ni, Russia's Dimitry Sautin and Mexico's Fernando 
Platas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been doing very well internationally. I've been diving  
very good and I'm just having fun,'' said Ruiz, one of four 
Americans to reach the final. 
</P>
<P>
	P.J. Bogert, Troy Dumais and David Pichler also were among the  
12 men who advanced to Saturday's final. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruiz swept all three individual titles in last month's U.S.  
Spring Nationals in his hometown of Orlando, something that hadn't 
been achieved since Greg Louganis did it in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	He added a gold in the synchronized platform event, which will  
be making its Olympic debut next year in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	The sweep has brought inevitable comparisons to Louganis, but it  
doesn't bother Ruiz. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's great,'' Ruiz said. ``Nobody else is going to be  
like Greg, to tell the truth. He's unique in the world, just like 
there's never going to be another Michael Jordan. I just try to do 
my best and hopefully I'll bring a gold to the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the Olympic Trials only a year away, this week will be a  
good test of how well Ruiz matches up on the international stage. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I do my dives good, I'm happy,'' he said. ``Hopefully, I'll  
end up in the top three.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The competition, which features many of the world's top divers,  
runs through the weekend. Finals in both men's and women's 
competition are Saturday and Sunday.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Touring SW Landmarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton will take a  
four-day tour of the Southwest to encourage preservation of 
landmarks and institutions. The trip will include visits to the 
Grand Canyon and Lowell Observatory, where scientists first sighted 
the planet Pluto. 
</P>
<P>
	The expedition, starting May 19, will focus on historic sites,  
buildings and monuments in need of restoration or maintenance. It 
is part a public-private enterprise campaign to ``Save America's 
Treasures.'' Backers include the White House Millennium Council and 
the National Trust for Historic Preservation. 
</P>
<P>
	The first stop will be the Grand Canyon. Other stops will  
include the observatory in Flagstaff, Ariz.; the Spanish governors' 
palace in Santa Fe, N.M., one of the first buildings in what is now 
the United States; and the ancient cliff dwellings of Mesa Verde 
National Park in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton began the series of trips last July, following an  
unusual itinerary that took her to Montpelier, the home of 
President James Madison in Orange, Va., then to the Edison Historic 
Site in West Orange, N.J. which tells the story of inventor Thomas 
Alva Edison. 
</P>
<P>
	She also went to George Washington's headquarters at Newburgh,  
N.Y., and to the Troy N.Y., home of a young Irish immigrant named 
Kate Mullany, who organized a woman's union nearly 200 years ago 
that succeeded in raising the pay of female laundry workers almost 
to that of males. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton later visited sites in Boston, Los Angeles and San  
Francisco.

<HEADLINE> Star Wars Buzz Hits Warp Speed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Summer blockbuster? Without a doubt. A sci-fi  
masterpiece that will please all its fans? Probably not, but it's 
got some cool effects. 
</P>
<P>
	The buzz on the new ``Star Wars'' movie is already circulating  
through cyberspace, now that it has been finally seen by a select 
few. 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' was screened  
Tuesday night in eight North American cities for movie theater 
executives, their families, and -- apparently -- a bundle of ``Star 
Wars'' fans who somehow finagled some of the prized tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost immediately, early reviews hit cyberspace, followed by  
the reactions to the reviews, then the reactions to the reactions, 
along with all manner of claims, counterclaims, insults and 
soul-searching over the film, which opens nationwide May 19. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys, it's a movie!'' responded Tom Sherak, distribution head  
of 20th Century Fox, which is releasing the film for George Lucas. 
``It isn't the Bible! It's fun, it's enjoyable, it's escapism. But 
it's a movie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Uh huh.  
</P>
<P>
	In what was titled, ``What I believe to be the FIRST review  
anywhere on the Internet,'' Ronald Epstein wrote on his Home 
Theater Forum Web site (www.hometheaterforum.com) that while he was 
impressed, the movie may not satisfy hard-core ``Star Wars'' fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like 'Star Wars,' it smells like 'Star Wars' and it  
feels like 'Star Wars.' However, is it a 'Star Wars' that we are 
going to walk away satisfied with? Well ... perhaps, but not for 
everyone,'' Epstein wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	While the early amateur critics loved the action sequences and  
most of the effects, including what they found to be an incredible 
underwater sequence, some reviewers thought the 2-hour-plus movie 
dragged a bit in places, that it was a little too kid-oriented and 
that one of the computer-generated characters, Jar Jar Binks, was 
annoying. 
</P>
<P>
	Such views, however, were quickly countered by those who, like  
Jerry Rhoades on Home Theater Forum, found the movie to be 
``PHENOMENAL!!!!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't watch it to analyze and match other people's reviews and  
thoughts to the film, just sit back, relax and enjoy the ride,'' he 
said. ``I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a leading ``Star Wars'' Web site, www.theforce.net, a writer  
using the nickname BetterJedi wrote, ``Wow! What a film. I'm going 
to have to see it about 10 or 15 times to take it all in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But another writer, going by Job21, wasn't as impressed. ``It  
was a dream come true at first but quickly turned into a 
nightmare,'' Job21 said. 
</P>
<P>
	That was countered by a fusillade of reaction from fans, many of  
whom raised doubts about whether Job even saw the movie, pointing 
out his review noticeably lacked the kinds of details that would 
suggest he was there. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the theater operators themselves, they gave their usual  
tempered thumbs-up -- they praised the movie just enough to avoid 
losing any customers but not so much that Lucas could extract 
higher fees for showing the film. 
</P>
<P>
	The bottom line, financially, is the early buzz -- or for that  
matter the reactions from the professional critics who see 
``Phantom'' Friday night -- won't mean a thing initially, said Paul 
Dergarabedian, of box office tracker Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``This movie is critic-proof,'' he said. ``I think it doesn't  
matter what anybody says, good, bad or indifferent. The film is 
going to play big in those first two weeks without question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After that ... the Force only knows.

<HEADLINE> EU Up Vs. Dollar on Peace Hopes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hopes for a peace agreement in Kosovo helped  
lift the European currency against the dollar Thursday. Trading 
against the yen was quiet following a holiday in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0802, up  
from $1.0740 late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 120.50 Japanese yen, down slightly from  
120.65, in subdued trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets in Japan were closed Monday through Wednesday  
for the nation's Golden Week holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	News that Russia and the major Western powers had drafted a plan  
to end the conflict in Kosovo jolted the euro higher against the 
dollar. The euro had been declining on concerns that continued 
fighting in the province could affect the overall European economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Wide fluctuations on Wall Street also drove the dollar lower.  
Stocks seesawed again Thursday as cautious remarks from Federal 
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan fanned fears that inflation may 
return to the robust U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4870 Swiss francs, down from  
1.4944, and 1.4552 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4515. The British 
pound rose to $1.6415 from $1.6377. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8106 German 
marks, down from 1.8212; 6.0716 French francs, down from 6.1087; 
and 1,792.11 Italian lire, down from 1,801.80.

	EL MONTE, Calif. (AP) -- A man who got into an early morning  
argument Thursday at a nightclub walked up to a booth and shot a 
man in the head, then gunned down three others seated near him. All 
four were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators studied a security camera videotape of the  
killings hoping to identify the gunman, who fled. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting happened shortly before 2 a.m. inside the  
International Club in El Monte, about 12 miles east of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 patrons were inside when the gunman pulled a handgun  
and fired at the first victim. The man then sprayed bullets across 
the booth, shooting the first victim's friend and two other people 
sitting with them. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they did not know what prompted the argument.  
</P>
<P>
	The first victim and his friend died at the scene, as did a  
third man. A 23-year-old woman died at a hospital shortly 
afterward.

<HEADLINE> Suns Looking To Win in Portland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Cliff Robinson can think of no better place to  
erase his image as a playoff flop than Portland's Rose Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	For eight seasons, Robinson played for the Trail Blazers, and  
when he and the rest of the Phoenix Suns begin their first-round 
playoff series in Portland Saturday, he knows he will be reminded 
loudly and rudely of his postseason failures there. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what will make it so much better when things go well,''  
Robinson said Wednesday, ``that it's there in Portland where I've 
had such a bad reputation in the playoffs. It would be a great 
place to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At age 32, finishing his 10th NBA season, Robinson is a much  
less intense and thoroughly a no-nonsense player, far from his 
``Uncle Cliffy'' days in Portland. The red, black or white headband 
he always wore on his shaved head was discarded when he left the 
Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point in my career, as far as having individual  
accomplishments, the only accomplishment I want is to win a 
championship,'' Robinson said. ``At this point in the season, you 
want to lose yourself in the team. You want to forget about all 
that other stuff. My only goal is to go out there and play hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson still has a home in Portland and his son lives there.  
He said it will be a little more hectic than usual because he has 
so many friends there. But he says he is relishing the opportunity, 
and his teammates think he'll come through fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it will be tough. I think he's going to thrive  
on going back home and playing in Portland,'' guard Jason Kidd 
said. ``I think he's excited about that challenge. He's really 
committed, and if he plays the way he has all season, he shouldn't 
have any problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Phoenix, Robinson is not expected to be ``the'' star. That  
role goes to Kidd and Tom Gugliotta. Robinson, though, has been 
critical to a team sorely lacking in athletic ability. 
</P>
<P>
	This year has been one of Robinson's best. Playing small forward  
almost exclusively, he's averaged 16.4 points per game, shooting 
.475 from the field. He finished eighth in the NBA in 3-point 
accuracy at .417 percent (58-for-139), was second only to Kidd 
among the Suns in steals with 75 and blocked 59 shots, 21 more than 
anyone else on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Kidd said Robinson was among the top two or three defensive  
small forwards in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cliff has had a great year,'' coach Danny Ainge said. ``Cliff  
is going into a playoff series this year where he has to just 
continue the role that he's played always for us. If he just plays 
the role he's played all year, he'll be fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson has averaged just over 16 points per game in his NBA  
career in the regular season. In the playoffs, the number drops to 
10.1. 
</P>
<P>
	His first three seasons, when he was part of a powerhouse  
Blazers team that twice made it to the NBA Finals, he had strong 
postseason efforts. But since then, he has shot better than 40 
percent only once is six playoff appearances. For his career, he's 
shot 21 percent from 3-point range in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem followed him to Phoenix, where he shot .273  
(9-for-33) from the field and missed his only 3-pointer in the 
Suns' first-round loss to San Antonio last year. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't help that Robinson had to play center or big forward  
against San Antonio's David Robinson and Tim Duncan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cliff is more comfortable with his role this year,'' Ainge  
said. ``He's more suited to the small forward position as opposed 
to playing center. I anticipate good things out of Cliff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's Rex Chapman. The Suns' guard had shown signs of  
breaking out of his season-long shooting slump in recent games, a 
trend of great importance to the Suns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a totally different team when Rex is stroking it from  
outside,'' Kidd said. 
</P>
<P>
	But two weeks ago in a game at Utah, Chapman was poked in the  
eye. He missed the next game and then was ordered to wear 
protective goggles. 
</P>
<P>
	Chapman hates them. He threw the goggles at the bench twice when  
Ainge tried to get him to wear them in Wednesday night's 
regular-season finale against Minnesota. During practice Thursday, 
when someone handed them to him, Chapman threw the goggles on the 
floor, stomped on them, then kicked the shattered remains away. 
</P>
<P>
	Ainge shrugged away the incident as if to say there's little he  
can do about it, and Chapman likely won't be wearing them in the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Chapman's emotion is a small concern. The emotion the Suns will  
face in Portland Saturday is of far greater importance to Ainge. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to be ornery. It's going to be loud,'' Ainge  
said. ``We have to try to keep close while the emotions are going 
crazy to start this series.''

<HEADLINE> Farmland, Cenex OK Merger Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The boards of Farmland Industries Inc.  
and Cenex Harvest States Cooperatives have approved resolutions to 
combine the two cooperatives, creating an agricultural giant with 
$20 billion in annual revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmland and Cenex have been involved in separate discussions on  
combining their grain operations and their petroleum refining and 
pipeline businesses. The companies already have an alliance in the 
sales, distribution and marketing of petroleum and related products 
and another joint venture involving the manufacture of pet foods. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see complete consolidation as an important step for our  
member-owners in the rapidly changing global marketplace,'' 
Farmland chairman Albert Shivley and Cenex co-chairmen Gerald 
Kuster and Elroy Webster said in a joint statement Thursday. 
``Bringing Cenex Harvest States and Farmland together should 
provide greater opportunities for future growth and cost benefits 
that will position our farmer-owned system for success. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies hope to complete a study on the feasibility of  
the merger and receive required governmental approval by late this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Member information meetings would take place in early 2000,  
followed by a vote of the memberships of both cooperatives. The 
companies have tentatively set June 1, 2000, as a goal for 
completing the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said they hope to combine the two companies with  
minimal effect on employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmland is the largest farmer-owned cooperative in North  
America with 1998 revenue of $8.8 billion in all 50 states and 90 
countries. When including Farmland's share of the sales of its 
affiliated businesses, sales were $11.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmland's business lines include crop production and crop  
protection products, livestock feeds, petroleum, grain processing 
and marketing, and the processing and marketing of pork and beef 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	Cenex is a cooperative system owned by farmers, ranchers and  
local co-ops from the Great Lakes to the Pacific Northwest and from 
the Canadian border to Texas. 1998 revenue was $8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Cenex also operates oil refineries and pipelines and provides a  
wide variety of products and services ranging from grain marketing 
to food processing.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Haitian immigrant Abner Louima told a jury  
Thursday that police officers who arrested him in 1997 took turns 
beating him before one sexually brutalized him with a stick in a 
police station bathroom.

	The enraged officer rammed the stick up Louima's rectum and then  
jammed it in Louima's mouth, he said in a halting voice at the

brutality and inflamed racial tensions in the city.

	Taking the stand on the third day of the trial, Louima at one  
point was asked to rise and identify the officer. He slowly scanned 
the courtroom before pointing at Officer Justin Volpe. Louima's 
finger shook visibly; Volpe sat expressionless. 
</P>
<P>
	After the attack, Louima testified, Volpe warned Louima that if  
he ``ever talked to anyone about what they did to me, he'd kill me 
and my family and he was not joking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe is one of four officers charged with beating Louima after  
mistakenly thinking he had sucker-punched Volpe as police tried to 
disperse a rowdy crowd outside a Brooklyn nightclub on Aug. 9, 
1997; a fifth officer is charged with covering up the assault. 
Prosecutors revealed this week that Louima's cousin was the man who 
punched Volpe. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe also is accused of sodomizing Louima in a fit of rage.  
Louima was hospitalized with severe internal injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Louima, 32, the government's star witness, slipped  
into the courtroom unobtrusively, wearing an oversized, dark blue 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Under questioning by Assistant U.S. Attorney Alan Vinegrad,  
Louima said his night began quietly. He described leaving his 
security guard job early, stopping at his parents' house and then 
joining his brother, cousin and friends for an outing to a popular 
nightspot, Club Rendezvous. 
</P>
<P>
	As the club closed and a large crowd spilled onto the street at  
about 4 a.m., Louima said, he noticed an injured man surrounded by 
police. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was one guy who had some blood on his face and was  
complaining that he got hit by a cop,'' Louima testified. 
Bystanders grew angry, he continued, and ``I was very angry, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Louima said he commented that police are ``not supposed to hit  
the person because they have rights.'' After that, he heard someone 
behind him say, ``Shut up,'' then felt himself being knocked to the 
ground and handcuffed. 
</P>
<P>
	Louima described being taken away in a patrol car to a nearby  
intersection where four white police officers -- identified earlier 
by prosecutors as Volpe, Thomas Bruder, Thomas Wiese and Charles 
Schwarz -- began pummeling him. One, he said, taunted him: ``Stupid 
nigger. I'm going to give you a lesson on how to respect a cop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following a second beating by two of the officers, Louima said,  
he was taken into the stationhouse, where one officer -- identified 
by Schwarz by prosecutors -- removed Louima's belt, the witness 
said. With his pants down at his knees and his hands still cuffed, 
the officer led him into the bathroom with Volpe following behind, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Louima said he noticed Volpe grab something near a trash can  
before being tossed face down near a toilet. Volpe kicked him in 
the groin, and then the mouth when he started to yell, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Louima also testified that he lied to reporters when he said  
that an officer had said ``It's Giuliani time,'' a reference to the 
law-and-order policies of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. He said two men 
who visited him at the hospital had told him to make the statement 
to attract attention. 
</P>
<P>
	On cross-examination, Volpe's attorney, Marvyn Kornberg,  
attempted to tarnish Louima's credibility by having him detail his 
financial stake in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Louima, who is unemployed, told jurors he had filed a $155  
million lawsuit against the city. He also said federal authorities 
have paid him $2,000 a month.

<HEADLINE> MCI WorldCom To End Nextel Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	McLEAN, Va. (AP) -- MCI WorldCom Inc., the nation's No. 2  
long-distance provider, and Nextel Communications Inc. have failed 
to reach an agreement on a possible merger. 
</P>
<P>
	``MCI WorldCom has determined not to pursue a bid for (Nextel)  
at this point,'' MCI WorldCom said in a statement Thursday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to back away from a possible deal leaves Jackson,  
Miss.-based MCI WorldCom as the only major long-distance provider 
without a stake in the $33 billion U.S. wireless phone business. 
</P>
<P>
	McLean, Va.-based Nextel is the last independent major wireless  
company and controls about 4 percent of the market. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom rival AT&AMP;T Corp., the largest long-distance company  
in the United States, bought McCaw Cellular Communications for 
$11.5 billion in 1994 and is spending billions more expanding its 
wireless network. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom was faced with assuming Nextel's $7 billion in  
debt, plus having to borrow more money to expand Nextel's network 
nationwide. Nextel's system relies on Motorola equipment and isn't 
compatible with other wireless carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility that a deal between MCI WorldCom and Nextel  
would not be reached had been widely reported before the companies 
made an official announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Nextel fell 75 cents Thursday to $35.12 1/2 in trading on  
the New York Stock Exchange, while shares of MCI WorldCom plunged 6 
percent, or $5, to $84.62 1/2 in trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> Fed Boss Hails 'Phenomenal' Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan called  
the economy's strong growth and low inflation ``truly phenomenal'' 
on Thursday, but he also expressed worries about ``imbalances in 
our expansion'' -- and that sent jitters through Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors and analysts saw Greenspan's comments as a warning  
signal that even though America is currently enjoying the best 
combination of rapid growth, low unemployment and low inflation in 
three decades, the central bank is worried. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of most concern is how long this remarkable period of  
prosperity can be extended,'' Greenspan told an audience at an 
international conference on banking in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are imbalances in our expansion that, unless redressed,  
will bring this long run of strong growth and low inflation to a 
close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As he has in the past, Greenspan expressed concern that the  
high-flying stock market could suddenly come back to earth, causing 
a reversal of the wealth effect that has powered consumer spending. 
Greenspan also said there was a ``limit to how long and how far'' 
America's soaring trade deficits can grow without bringing 
international pressures to bear on the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	But Greenspan reserved his greatest worries for tight labor  
markets, which have driven unemployment down to a 29-year-low of 
4.2 percent, far below the level of 6 percent unemployment that 
economists used to believe was the threshold point at which tight 
labor markets would begin to trigger inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	That hasn't occurred in this expansion, and Greenspan said  
Thursday he believed the reason for that was a burst of 
productivity in recent years stemming from heavy investment by 
businesses in computers and other high-tech gadgets of the 
information age. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan noted that over the past 12 months productivity --  
output per hour of work -- has been rising at nearly a 3 percent 
annual rate, three times the anemic 1 percent rate of the early 
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher output with the same number of workers allows businesses  
to pay those workers more and enjoy higher profits without raising 
the price of goods, something that would make inflation worse. 
</P>
<P>
	But Greenspan also warned that the gains in productivity cannot  
keep inflation at bay forever because sooner or later the dwindling 
pool of workers will start demanding wage hikes that can't be 
covered by rising productivity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Productivity is the good news, but Greenspan is warning that  
the good news won't last forever,'' said David Jones, chief 
economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said he read Greenspan's remarks as a caution that later  
this year the Fed will start to tighten interest rates because of 
inflation concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Greenspan dumped a pail of cold water on those analysts who  
believe the U.S. economy has entered a new era'' where the old 
rules don't apply, said Tim O'Neil, chief economist for Harris Bank 
in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, demand for bonds fell sharply with investors  
demanding much higher rates of return as protection against 
inflation. The yield on Treasury's benchmark 30-year-bond shot up 
to 5.79 percent, the highest level in 11 months, compared to 5.70 
percent on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks initially dropped as well after Greenspan's speech,  
falling by more than 100 points. But by the end of trading the Dow 
Jones industrial average had recovered to close with a loss of only 
9 points at 10,947. 
</P>
<P>
	Other economic reports Thursday showed that labor markets remain  
tight and consumer demand, which is two-thirds of the economy, is 
still strong. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's biggest retailers reported that their sales soared  
in April, the third straight month of better-than-expected sales. 
The Labor Department said the number of Americans filing 
applications for unemployment benefits rose by a slight 6,000 last 
week to 301,000, still a level indicating a strong job market. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Business Council, composed of chief executives from  
America's largest corporations, issued an economic forecast 
Thursday predicting the U.S. economy will slow this year but still 
turn in a solid performance of around 2.8 percent, with inflation 
rising only modestly to 2.1 percent, compared with a 1.6 percent 
increase in prices in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanford Weill, co-chairman of Citigroup, said the Business  
Council economic consultants who prepared the forecast believe the 
worst of the global currency crisis is over. They put the chances 
for a recession in the United States occurring over the next two 
years at less than 50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan conceded that the Fed, along with most private  
forecasters, has been consistently too pessimistic in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inflation has been chronically overpredicted and real GDP  
growth underpredicted,'' he said. ``The performance of the American 
economy over the past seven years has been truly phenomenal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Greenspan said there were clearly downside risks that Fed  
policy-makers must be alert to, including what he termed the 
``fragile recovery'' in Asian nations hit by a currency crisis that 
has plunged one-third of the world into recession. 
</P>
<P>
	``The remarkable American economy ... and the Asian crises that  
caught us by surprise, among other humbling experiences, have made 
policy-makers particularly sensitive to how fast the world can 
shift beneath our feet,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Man Details Breast Cancer Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- James Lowery was showering the first time he  
felt a tiny lump in his chest. It didn't hurt, and it was 
``pinhole-sized,'' barely noticeable under his left nipple. So he 
didn't give it much thought. 
</P>
<P>
	A year later, the lump was still there, only now the skin over  
it was a little rough. Eventually it oozed, like a scab over a 
healing sore. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, ``I didn't have any pain,'' Lowery insisted. ``So I  
didn't know I had a problem. ... I thought it would go away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a year and a half before Lowery saw a doctor. He was  
stunned by the diagnosis: breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, 'Men don't get breast cancer,''' Lowery said.  
</P>
<P>
	But men can indeed get breast cancer -- 1,300 American men will  
get it this year alone, and it will kill 400. For reasons that are 
unclear, the incidence is rising, up from about 800 cases annually 
a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	That's less than 1 percent of the nation's total breast cancer  
cases. The disease will strike 175,000 women this year, and kill 
43,000. Women have fought back with activism: Survivors wear pink 
ribbons and march to raise research money and urge other women to 
get regular mammograms to detect tumors early. 
</P>
<P>
	Partly because male breast cancer is rare, men like Lowery  
simply never heard about it. Men don't discuss it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Men are kind of surprised they have it, and they certainly  
don't like to go public with it,'' said Dr. William Donegan of the 
Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee. ``I think in men it may 
be a much more private thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That lack of awareness means few men see a doctor before their  
breast cancer has advanced, so ``survival has not been as high as 
in women,'' said Donegan, the American Cancer Society's expert on 
male breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	And it meant that Lowery's family spent hours hunting for the  
scarce information available on male breast cancer. Even his 
surgeon had had only one male patient previously. As for support 
groups for men, Lowery couldn't find any. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did feel lonely a long, long time,'' said Lowery, 74, of  
Mayer, Ariz. Lowery, who told his story to raise awareness and 
support for male patients, added, ``My daughter and my wife have 
been my support group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The good news is that doctors do understand male breast cancer  
fairly well. They know that men are at increased risk if many women 
in their families have had breast cancer. Radiation exposure is 
another risk factor. 
</P>
<P>
	In men, tumors usually develop under the nipple, which then can  
become inverted, Donegan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Men get the same treatment as women.  
</P>
<P>
	For Lowery, that saga began when he mentioned a growth on his  
shoulder to his daughter. She thought it looked like skin cancer 
and insisted he see a doctor right away, even though he was 
visiting her home in Oregon. Lowery turned out to have melanoma, 
but during that visit the doctor also spotted the lump in his left 
breast and delivered the additional bad news. 
</P>
<P>
	Right away, they scheduled a mastectomy. Surgeons also removed  
15 lymph nodes from under his left arm that, fortunately, were 
cancer-free. 
</P>
<P>
	Then began three months of chemotherapy to target any cancer  
that might be roaming through his body. Like female patients, 
Lowery suffered nausea from the treatment and lost all his body 
hair, but last week he was declared in remission.

	Much breast cancer growth is spurred by estrogen, even in men.  
So just like women whose tumors are ``estrogen receptor positive,'' 
he's about to take the drug tamoxifen for the next five years in 
hopes of preventing a recurrence. 
</P>
<P>
	And just like 30 percent of women with breast cancer, Lowery  
said he was diagnosed with too many copies of a gene called HER2, 
which can make breast cancer more aggressive. A new drug helps 
women who are HER2-positive, but Donegan said he's not aware of it 
being tried yet in men. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowery now offers advice: ``Men ought to do like women and check  
themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And if they feel ``a lump in the breast or any change in the  
nipple or anything that doesn't look right,'' see a doctor 
immediately, Donegan concluded.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Says GIs Were Beaten </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The three U.S. Army soldiers released from  
Serb captivity had been beaten with rifle butts, kicked and punched 
by the men who captured them near the Macedonian border, a Pentagon 
official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although there were also periods of harsh treatment during  
interrogation in the several days following after their capture ... 
we believe the bulk of their injuries were sustained in the early 
moments of the captivity,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said, 
releasing the first details of their capture. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon also said the Army has concluded ``beyond a shadow of a  
doubt'' that the three soldiers were on the Macedonian side of the 
border when they were captured, not on the Yugoslav side as the 
Yugoslav authorities claimed. He said their captors were armed and 
wore the uniforms of the Yugoslav army. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were taken by a substantially larger force,'' Bacon said.  
``I don't know how much larger, but they felt that they didn't have 
any alternative but to stop. And in fact, as they tried to get out, 
they ran into an obstacle which I believe was a ditch, which also 
made it difficult for them to get away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three, who met with President Clinton in Germany on  
Wednesday, are Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smiths 
Creek, Mich.; Staff Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles, and 
Spc. Steven M. Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	When examined by doctors after their release on Sunday, Ramirez  
was found to have a stitched-up wound on the top of his head and 
two fractured ribs, as well as swelling of his lower right leg. His 
injuries have begun to heal and no surgery is planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone was found to have a broken nose, plus bruises and  
abrasions on his face. Shortly before his release last Sunday, 
Stone gave his prison guards in Belgrade a thank-you note for 
treating him with respect and dignity. The Army said these guards 
were not the ones who had captured and beaten the three. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors said Gonzales ``turned out fine'' in initial checkups,  
but had light injuries to his wrists. 
</P>
<P>
	The three were honored Thursday by their fellow 1st Infantry  
Division soldiers in Wuerzburg, Germany. They were awarded the 
Purple Heart for injuries received in captivity, the Army 
Commendation Medal, the Prisoner of War Medal, the Armed Forces 
Medal, the United Nations Medal, and the NATO Medal. 
</P>
<P>
	The three are scheduled to return to their homes in the United  
States on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon said the Army's investigation found that one of the three  
Americans was manning a .50-caliber machine gun on their Humvee 
scout vehicle at the time they were captured, and together the 
three also had one M-16 rifle and two unspecified sidearms. 
</P>
<P>
	The machine gun apparently had ammunition but was not in  
position to fire, Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not ready to go because typically when you drive around  
you don't have the thing ready to fire,'' he said. The soldier 
manning the machine gun ``followed the normal rule of getting out 
of the line of fire so he wouldn't be shot,'' Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The three were supposed to have linked up with other members of  
their platoon before they were surrounded by the Yugoslavs, Bacon 
said. Bacon was asked why they had split off in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did consciously do some training exercises on their own  
individually, but they were supposed to reconstitute into their 
three-vehicle platoon or convoy before leaving, and this one did 
not come back to the place where they were supposed to 
reconstitute,'' he said, adding that the Army would provide a 
fuller explanation later. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were actually training to avoid the type of situation in  
which they were caught,'' Bacon added. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army also has concluded from its investigation that the  
Americans had been ``observed for some time from across the border 
and that their movements were somewhat known to the other side,'' 
prior to capture, Bacon said.

<HEADLINE> Panel Says Weigh Soldiers' Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Military commanders making battle decisions  
should consider the potential long-term health effects on their 
troops in addition to any immediate danger, says a panel advising 
the government on medical issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to do, it's very hard to do,'' admitted Dr. Fred A.  
Mettler Jr. of the University of New Mexico, chairman of the 
Institute of Medicine committee that submitted the report and 
series of recommendations Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he added, ``just because it's difficult doesn't mean  
they shouldn't try to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``As one goes toward peacekeeping type missions where you're not  
expecting a lot of fatalities, and things are not as urgent to get 
done, you really should be thinking about long-term effects and not 
say 'No one got killed so everything is wonderful,''' said Mettler, 
chairman of the Department of Radiology at the university's School 
of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Col. Carl Curling of the Army Surgeon General's office said  
commanders began looking at long-term health considerations 
following the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really began to be concerned about this as far back as  
1992,'' Curling said, when troops were sent into Bosnia on 
peacekeeping duty. 
</P>
<P>
	``In general we're very happy with the report,'' he said, noting  
that it is still being reviewed by Army officials. ``I haven't seen 
a tremendous problem in any of the recommendations they provided,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The risk of global nuclear war has been reduced, but less  
intense exposure of troops can occur in small-scale nuclear 
exchanges, terrorist attacks, the use of radioactive materials in 
conventional explosives and in accidents at nuclear power plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The Institute was asked to study the threat of radiation  
exposure on soldiers, but didn't limit its recommendations to that 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``The long-term effects to be considered in operational  
decisions should include not only those from radiation but also 
those from conventional injuries, chemical and biological agents, 
and psychological stress,'' said the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditional risk evaluation in planning military action focuses  
on acute injuries that could affect the ability to accomplish a 
mission, while long-term consequences are left to the Department of 
Veterans Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The report acknowledged that in many cases a commander ``is not  
likely to have hard data to use in assessing most long-term risks, 
and the long-term effects of some agents may not even be known.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, the panel added: ``That task of making difficult decisions  
is the precise job of the commander.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Institute of Medicine is an arm of the National Academy of  
Sciences, an independent organization that gives the government 
scientific advice. 
</P>
<P>
	In this case, the Army requested a study of the effects on  
soldiers of radiation doses of 700 milliSieverts. That amount would 
not have any immediate impact on an individual but would pose an 
increased risk of leukemia and other cancers in future. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the committee urged the Army to develop a philosophy of  
radiation protection including making sure that in peacetime or 
non-emergency situations, soldiers receive the same level of 
protection as civilian radiation workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also recommended:  
</P>
<P>
	--Increased training for soldiers in dealing with radiation.  
</P>
<P>
	--Keeping records of exposure to radiation in soldiers' permanent  
medical files. 
</P>
<P>
	--Seeking ways to minimize the radiation dose of their troops.  
</P>
<P>
	--Making sure the benefit of the action is worth the risk.

<HEADLINE> Gore Switched From Host to Guest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- CNN changed its mind about having Al Gore host  
its ``Larry King Live'' program just hours before the show aired 
Thursday night, instead scheduling him as a guest. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN executive producer Wendy Whitworth had approached Gore last  
weekend to see if he was interested in hosting the show for an 
evening to discuss the shootings in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore agreed, but the network changed its mind Thursday  
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``After taking a long hard look at the political calendar, we  
decided it was too close to the 2000 election to have a 
presidential contender as an interviewer, not interviewee,'' King 
said at the opening of the show. ``...The vice president has 
graciously agreed to give me back my microphone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said he was just pleased to be there, in any role.  
</P>
<P>
	``Thank you for having me on, whether it's on this side of the  
table or the other side of the table,'' he told King. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN would not say whether its decision was prompted by  
complaints from several prominent Republicans, including Jim 
Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter addressed to King and faxed Thursday afternoon,  
Nicholson expressed concern about Gore's appearance on a show 
without any Republican representation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pleased that CNN chose to reconsider the decision  
regarding the vice president's appearance tonight. We concur that 
it was a decision made in error,'' said RNC spokesman Tim 
Fitzpatrick. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN pointed out in its statement that politicians have hosted  
``Larry King'' programs in the past. Among them: Republicans Newt 
Gingrich and Dan Quayle, and Ross Perot, a past independent 
candidate for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was in that tradition that we booked Vice President Al Gore  
to come on and discuss the tragedies in Littleton'' and tornadoes 
this week in the Midwest, CNN said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Lehane, a Gore spokesman, said the vice president had no  
problem changing hats. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recognize that CNN is in a difficult situation and they've  
handled it in a very classy way,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who earlier in the day toured the tornado damage in  
Kansas, spoke briefly on the show about what he witnessed. Most of 
the program, however, was devoted to the Littleton shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a warning of something deeper than just the widespread  
availability of guns and violence in the media and video games and 
Internet sites that have been involved, and deeper even than 
whatever failures of parenting have gone into this,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that it is being seen and heard all across our country  
as a spiritual signal that we really have to take stock of what we 
want in our country -- what kind of families, what kind of 
communities.''

<HEADLINE> Oil Leases Sold in Alaska Wilds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- A vast wilderness set aside for  
commercial oil leases in 1923 had appeared safe from drilling after 
companies failed to find oil in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	But technological advances have made oil exploration more  
feasible, reigniting companies' interest in the 23 million acres of 
the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlantic Richfield Co. and a partner, Anadarko Petroleum Corp.,  
were the leading bidders Wednesday in the government's first sale 
of drilling leases in 15 years on the land 75 miles west of Prudhoe 
Bay. Arco and Anadarko won exploration and production rights to 93 
tracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Bids totaling about $105 million were accepted for 134 tracts in  
the northeast corner of the oil reserve, which was established by 
President Warren G. Harding to ensure that the Navy would always 
have enough fuel. The state and the federal government will split 
the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Lease sales in the 1980s were a flop, with only one dry well  
drilled, in part because exploration techniques were relatively 
primitive and the means to get oil to market underdeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, high-tech seismic exploration using powerful computers to  
locate underground reserves has companies interested again, and 
branches of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline now are closer to the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to environmental concerns, Interior Secretary Bruce  
Babbitt set a number of stipulations on the sale to protect key 
areas. He placed 600,000 acres off-limits to leasing, and 
restricted surface activity on another 900,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, The Sierra Club, one of the environmental groups that  
fought to block the lease sale, contends the Interior Department 
didn't do enough to keep oil activities away from wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen temporary protections fall by the wayside before,''  
said spokeswoman Sara Callaghan. ``In less than 30 years of North 
Slope development, we have hundreds of miles of roads, pipelines 
and toxic waste sites.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists argue the reserve's wetlands are important  
waterfowl breeding grounds that can't withstand oil exploration. 
</P>
<P>
	It likely will take at least five years before any commercial  
production begins, said Kevin Meyers, Arco Alaska's president.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Lower; Dow Ends Off 8.59 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices fluctuated again today and ended  
lower, unable to shake off growing worries about inflation that 
were fed by cautionary remarks from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 8.59 at 10,946.82.  
The Dow followed the same path it took in yesterday's session, 
changing direction several times. It fell as much as 103 points 
during afternoon trading today before regaining ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader market indicators also were mostly lower. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was down 15.23 at 1,332.08, and the Nasdaq 
composite index was down 61.27 at 2,473.18. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancers outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the New  
York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 873.7 million shares, 
down from Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 4.32 at 633.05, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was up 2.32 at 787.81. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index, which reflects the performance of  
smaller-company stocks, fell 0.89 at 433.38. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors are increasingly worried that the robust economy will  
reawaken inflation and prompt the Federal Reserve to push rates 
higher when its policy writers meet in two weeks. Higher rates are 
the market's nemesis, because they can quickly eat into corporate 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	In remarks to bankers in Chicago, Greenspan praised the  
performance of the U.S. economy in recent years, but warned that 
gains in productivity cannot keep inflation at bay forever. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I have said on previous occasions, there are imbalances in  
our expansion that, unless redressed, will bring this long run of 
strong growth and low inflation to a close,'' he said. He said 
tight labor markets, for example, could ultimately threaten the 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	His morning caused already jittery stock and bond markets to  
fall. The Treasury's 30-year bond carried a yield of 5.77 percent, 
up sharply from late Wednesday's 5.70 percent and from the 5.55 
percent levels of two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hawkish tone from Greenspan is shaking the trees of growth  
stocks and, as a result, continuing to put downward pressure on 
growth and financial stocks,'' said Tom Galvin, chief equity 
strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial services stocks were particularly hard hit by the  
interest rate worries. The discount broker Schwab Corp. was down 
sharply, and Chase Manhattan and J.P. Morgan were also among the 
losers. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail stocks also felt the pinch, despite the announcement  
today that many big retailers had better-than-expected sales in 
April. Gap Inc. fell sharply, partly because Easter sales were 
reported in March. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T was up after announcing that Microsoft Corp. will invest $5  
billion in the telecommunications company. In return, AT&AMP;T said it 
will increase its use of Microsoft's software. Microsoft fell 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, AT&AMP;T negotiated its victory in a bidding war with  
Comcast over MediaOne Group Inc., the nation's fourth-largest cable 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Internet stocks fell, perhaps at the threat from the  
Microsoft-AT&AMP;T communications alliance.

<HEADLINE>  Oklahomans Return to Tornado Scene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- In her debris-littered front yard,  
7-year-old Megan Varva leaped across chunks of concrete and wood 
like a gazelle on an obstacle course. 
</P>
<P>
	``My outfit is new,'' she said proudly, tugging at her  
pink-and-white striped shorts set. ``My mom said I'm going to be 
getting about a new outfit a day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Megan's new wardrobe isn't a luxury. Her old clothes, like much  
of her neighborhood, lay twisted in the dirt after Monday's deadly 
tornadoes in Oklahoma and Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to go in there,'' the first-grader said of what  
little was left of her house. ``It isn't nice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many in the twister-scarred southern Plains would agree. Their  
homes are now nothing more than a jagged nest of splintered wood, 
mangled furniture, shattered glass -- and broken dreams. 
</P>
<P>
	The big orange ``U'' spray painted along a wall of 9-year-old  
Sara and 5-year-old Rebecca Johnson's home in Haysville, Kan., said 
it all: Uninhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 3 inches of rain have poured in through the roof. The  
house must be inspected for structural damage before Dave Johnson 
and his daughters can even think of returning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just picking up the pieces,'' Johnson said Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	All around Oklahoma City, cars -- some with smashed windows --  
lined up at police and National Guard checkpoints as families came 
to dig through the debris before an 8 p.m. curfew. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheryl and John Molsbee drove slowly past mounds of debris that  
obliterated neighborhood landmarks before finally pulling up to 
their brick-and-frame home. It no longer had a roof. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's worse than I thought,'' said John Molsbee.  
</P>
<P>
	Officials said 38 people died and more than 751 people were  
injured in the deadliest tornado to hit Oklahoma since 1947. The 
twisters killed five in Kansas and injured nearly 150 people. 
</P>
<P>
	More twisters swarmed across parts of Texas and Arkansas on  
Tuesday, killing one person. And late Wednesday, strong winds were 
blamed for several deaths in Tennessee as storms destroyed homes in 
dozens of counties and temporarily shut down the Nashville 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials had received about 100 missing persons reports in  
Oklahoma, but they were uncertain how many were duplicates. A 
master list of the missing was expected to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
	John Long, chief of the public education office for the Oklahoma  
City Fire Department, said he didn't expect the fatality count to 
grow by much. Rescuers have made at least three searches of each 
damaged home. 
</P>
<P>
	The damage estimate has been placed at more than $225 million in  
Oklahoma and more than $140 million in Kansas, where 1,129 
buildings were destroyed in Monday's storms. 
</P>
<P>
	A disaster housing program through the Federal Emergency  
Management Agency will provide rental assistance for up to 18 
months, said Ben Frizzell of the Oklahoma Office of Civil Emergency 
Management. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those trying to get their lives together was Calvin  
Waters, a sheet metal worker in Haysville whose home was heavily 
damaged. He spent a second day trying to clear the debris, patch 
holes in the roof and mop up. 
</P>
<P>
	Waters called himself fortunate. He was shaken by the deaths of  
a woman and her month-old baby near his home -- two people he didn't 
know. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always think a child should get a chance to grow up,'' he  
said. ``If you have to take two people, don't take a baby child. 
Take me, I'm 44 years old.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has authorized emergency disaster declarations  
for both Oklahoma and Kansas, paving the way for federal emergency 
funds for home and business owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Anderson will likely need both forms of aid. Before a  
tornado destroyed his used motorcycle shop in Midwest City -- just 
outside Oklahoma City -- it stopped first in Moore, sucking up his 
home and leaving it a shattered pile of glass and metal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it hasn't sunk in yet,'' he said. ``Yesterday,  
I woke up and said it has to be a dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For hundreds of regional business owners, the nightmare has  
begun. 
</P>
<P>
	They must negotiate with insurance companies, hope for a fair  
and quick settlement, and eventually -- if they can manage it -- get 
back to business. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Silsby, an owner of a destroyed surplus store in Midwest  
City, tried to put a positive spin on things as he surveyed the 
wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday was the shock of, `I've lost everything,''' he said.  
``Now it doesn't matter. We can replace it.''

<HEADLINE>  Asian Markets Rise; Tokyo Surges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets rose Thursday, with  
Japan's key index soaring 3.59 percent to an 18-month high. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, growing expectations that Japan may intensify efforts  
to repair its economy pushed the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock 
Average up 599.08 points to 17,300.61 points -- its highest close 
since 17,363.74 on Oct. 24, 1997. The index fell 1.42 percent on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets in Japan were closed Monday through Wednesday  
for the nation's ``Golden Week'' holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said Monday in Washington that he  
would guarantee a revival of the Japanese economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoshiro Mori, secretary-general of the ruling Liberal Democratic  
Party, reportedly hinted at the need to increase public spending to 
boost growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are expecting more spending,'' said Tsuyoshi Nomaguchi  
of Daiwa Securities in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar rose against the Japanese yen. The  
dollar bought 120.48 yen in late afternoon, up 0.90 yen from late 
last Friday in Tokyo but below its late New York level Wednesday of 
120.65 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, shares ended a volatile session lower as a recent  
rally that started early last month started running out of steam.

<HEADLINE> Analysts Mull Pan-Europe Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The wave of consolidation reshaping European  
banks, phone companies and carmakers has reached the trading floors 
of the region's stock exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	Directors of eight leading stock markets hope to create the  
first pan-European exchange for blue-chip stocks that would provide 
unified trading rules. 
</P>
<P>
	While such a combination could lower costs for investors and  
enable Europe to better compete with Wall Street, some analysts 
said Wednesday that management and technical problems could stymie 
the international effort. One critic suggested that it was a 
throwback to an inefficient era of state-sponsored monopolies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a massive project. If they don't get it right the first  
time, it's going to be very difficult to get it off the ground,'' 
said Chris McKellick, director of trading at Societe Generale Asset 
Management U.K. Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	The heads of the eight exchanges signed an agreement Tuesday to  
work toward creating a Europewide stock market. The London Stock 
Exchange and Germany's Deutsche Boerse, which formed a strategic 
alliance last July, are the nucleus of the group. Joining them were 
leading exchanges in the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Italy, France 
and Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	The participants hope to create an efficient and low-cost market  
for the trading of shares in the region's strongest companies. And 
they're holding open the door to other national exchanges that may 
choose to participate. 
</P>
<P>
	Their project developed partly as a consequence of the adoption  
by 11 European nations of a single currency, the euro. That single 
currency lowered one barrier to cross-border trading, the cost of 
converting one country's currency to the currency in which the 
stock was being traded. But a pan-European market still would have 
currency problems because Britain and Switzerland have not adopted 
the euro, 
</P>
<P>
	Competition from U.S. stock exchanges has also played a part.  
The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market both are 
considering extending hours to overlap with more of the trading day 
in Europe and Asia, putting pressure on profit margins for 
exchanges in those regions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is perfectly normal to expect a fully integrated  
pan-European exchange,'' said Paul Horne, an economist with Salomon 
Smith Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts, however, foresee substantial challenges to the  
development of a truly regional bourse. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight European exchanges have refused to say how they expect  
to oversee their creation and to share profits from it. Technical 
problems are likely to slow efforts to integrate different 
electronic trading systems, while eight sets of regulations may 
prove tough to unify, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``One set of rules cannot suit every size of trade and every  
type of investor,'' said Narayan Naik, an associate professor of 
finance at London Business School. 
</P>
<P>
	Medium-sized and smaller firms will continue to trade on  
national stock markets, while specialized stock exchanges will try 
to lure away niche business from a pan-European market, Naik said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden's Stockholm Stock Exchange withdrew from the enterprise  
because it felt participants were moving in an anti-competitive 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think this cartel is reactionary. They're trying to  
preserve an old sort of structure,'' spokesman Gustaf Sahlman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swedish exchange prefers offering clients a full range of  
trading, including such risky investments as derivatives and 
options, as well as stocks. It also plans to do more than the other 
eight exchanges to accommodate trading on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	McKellick of Societe Generale believes a pan-European exchange  
would be of greatest benefit to small investors, who would have 
centralized access to stocks from across the region. 
</P>
<P>
	But as in telecommunications, banking and other industries, the  
brokerage companies that stand to gain the most from a pan-European 
stock market are those that are biggest. 
</P>
<P>
	Smaller brokerages will probably need to develop specialized  
skills in order to survive. Charterhouse Securities, a London-based 
brokerage, has chosen to focus strictly on analyzing British 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe some investors would like to come to a house that  
has a good, strong presence in the local market,'' said managing 
director Steve Adams.

<HEADLINE> Spurs Riding High in Playoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- After four huge victories in five days, the  
San Antonio Spurs finally indulged in some celebrating Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs, dominant down the stretch in the regular season, won  
the Midwest Division title and secured the No. 1 seed throughout 
the playoffs with an 88-81 victory at Golden State on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The games have come so fast and every one of them has been so  
important to us we haven't had a lot of time to relax and enjoy 
what was happening,'' said Spurs center David Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to enjoy it a little bit,'' Robinson said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs face No. 8 Minnesota in a best-of-5 Western Conference  
series beginning Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Saturday, the Spurs beat Portland in overtime in the  
Alamodome, then defeated Utah the next day in the dome. On Tuesday 
the Spurs beat the Trailblazers in Portland before the game in 
California on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of jubilant San Antonio fans, cheering and carrying  
signs saying ``Go Spurs Go,'' greeted the players on a warm, 
cloudless afternoon at the airport Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty awesome,'' said forward Sean Elliott. ``I wonder  
what's going to happen if we win this thing. They're going to rip 
the roof off this city. That'd be cool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing shirts proclaiming ``Midwest Division Champions,'' the  
players said they were trying to enjoy the moment before practice 
resumes Friday in preparation for the Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Spurs had lost to the Warriors, San Antonio would have  
been seeded No. 3 in the Western Conference behind Utah and 
Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio and Utah each went 37-13 this season, but the Spurs  
claimed the Midwest Division crown and the conference title because 
they won their season series against the Jazz 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``More than us getting the best record in the NBA, we wanted to  
win the last game going into the playoffs. But we understood that 
last game going into the playoffs had a lot of ramifications,'' 
said guard Avery Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he believes Utah will be the most formidable opponent in  
the postseason, Robinson said the Spurs must be ready to face a 
strong Timberwolves team in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been playing well. We've just got to keep doing the  
things we've been doing. Our defense has been at a great level, and 
that's what we need to carry us through,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team is farther along than any team I've ever been on,''  
said Robinson, a 10-year veteran. ``So I'm excited.''

<HEADLINE> Grizzlies' Worst Season Finally Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- For a franchise that has seen  
it's share of lows in its short four-year existence, the Vancouver 
Grizzlies out-did themselves this season. 
</P>
<P>
	They were the worst. The worst in the NBA with an 8-42 record.  
Their won-loss percentage of .160 was the worst in franchise 
history. And they lost a league-worst 24 road games, including 
their last 23 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	How bad was this season? Three of their wins came against the  
Los Angeles Clippers, the NBA's second-worst team. On the other 
hand, they were a mere 3-24 against plus-.500 teams, with their 
biggest win coming against the Los Angeles Lakers, which was the 
last game for Lakers coach Del Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grizzlies suffered through a 13-game losing streak and lose  
seven in a row to end the season. Their 87-84 loss at home to 
Denver on April 7, marked the Nuggets' first road win in 25 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have mixed emotions about it. It was a very trying season,''  
said Grizzlies coach Brian Hill, who is 27-113 in two seasons with 
Vancouver. ``You're probably happy that it's over, because you 
don't want to see your team going through that anymore. And yet at 
the same time you want to immediately get started to rectify the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody needs to step back away from it.''  
</P>
<P>
	When Shareef Abdur-Rahim was asked if he was happy to get this  
season out of the way, he said, ``Yeah, you kind of want to get the 
misery over with. ... The kind of season we had, I don't think 
there's anything encouraging about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abdur-Rahim, who entered this year signing a six-year contract  
extension, had a 23-points per game average, fourth best in the 
league. The only other bright spot was the play of rookie Mike 
Bibby, who stepped into the starting point guard role and finished 
averaging 13.2 points a game and 6.5 assists, 13th in the league, 
and tops among first-year players. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grizzlies were behind the eight-ball from the start when  
center Bryant Reeves reported to camp about 40 pounds overweight, 
and they then lost veteran point guard Lee Mayberry (ankle surgery) 
who missed all but nine games this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves' troubles didn't end. He started the season coming off  
the bench. By the time he got in game-shape, he suffered a 
season-ending knee injury and missed the last 25 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Down the stretch, the Grizzlies were forced to go with a  
starting lineup that featured journeyman Tony Massenburg at center, 
and two rookies -- Bibby and Felipe Lopez -- in the backcourt. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grizzlies, who's all-time record stands at 56-240, will now  
have their first shot at getting the No. 1 pick in this June's 
draft. Under the expansion rules introduced when they entered the 
NBA, the Grizzlies and fellow expansion Toronto Raptors were barred 
from getting the top pick in their first three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Grizzlies president and general manager Stu Jackson isn't sure  
what he will do with the pick, considering he has expressed a 
desire to add veteran experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to be under enormous pressure to really trade that  
pick and really do the whirly-bird,'' Jackson said. ``But at the 
same time, we could have in front of us potentially an NBA All-Star 
of the future, which is ultimately the way you gain ground in this 
league. So it's going to be a tough dilemma.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, in the fourth year of his five-year contract, remained  
optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``A fan wrote me something the other day that I'll share with  
you. They wrote, `Gold has to undergo through some intense heat 
before it becomes a true metal.' And maybe this is the time when 
we're going through a little of that heat before we realize what it 
is we have,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how much more heat the team can take, Jackson said, ``I'm  
not a magician or a mind-reader. I don't have a crystal ball. I'll 
just leave it at that.''

<HEADLINE>  Asian Markets Rise; Tokyo Surges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets rose Thursday, with  
Japan's key index soaring 3.59 percent to an 18-month high. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, growing expectations that Japan may intensify efforts  
to repair its economy pushed the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock 
Average up 599.08 points to 17,300.61 points -- its highest close 
since 17,363.74 on Oct. 24, 1997. The index fell 1.42 percent on 
Friday.

	Financial markets in Japan were closed Monday through Wednesday  
for the nation's ``Golden Week'' holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said Monday in Washington that he  
would guarantee a revival of the Japanese economy.

of Daiwa Securities in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar rose against the Japanese yen. The  
dollar bought 120.48 yen in late afternoon, up 0.90 yen from late 
last Friday in Tokyo but below its late New York level Wednesday of 
120.65 yen.

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales Strong in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Most national retailers enjoyed robust sales for  
a third straight month in April, many topping expectations, as 
shoppers remained confident about the economic backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the strong showing should translate into healthy  
profits for the recently ended quarter -- Limited and Ann Taylor, 
among others, have said they will exceed analyst forecasts -- retail 
shares fell sharply on Wall Street Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts noted that because April's sales increases weren't as  
strong as those in preceeding months, investors grew worried that a 
slowdown may be setting in. 
</P>
<P>
	Gap shares tumbled $5.12 1/2 to $64.25 and Wal-Mart fell $2.18 3/4 to  
$42.87 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the underlying tone of business is good,'' said Wayne  
Hood, a retail analyst at Prudential Securities in Atlanta. ``But 
Wall Street doesn't measure things in terms of good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A surprisingly resilient U.S. economy, with low unemployment and  
tame inflation, has kept consumers confident about their personal 
finances and their ability to spend. 
</P>
<P>
	The mood has also been bolstered by the stock market, which  
continued its record-setting pace this week with the Dow Jones 
industrial average crossing the 11,000 mark just amonth after it 
breached 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most Americans are working and feeling pretty good, and that  
is driving traffic into the stores,'' said Steve Paspal, senior 
retail analyst at Sovereign Asset Management, a subsidiary of John 
Hancock Funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The big winners in April were specialty clothing chains, while  
department stores also fared well, especially discounters such as 
Wal-Mart and Kmart. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest sales data shined despite comparisons with the  
stunning performance of April 1998, when sales jumped 9.5 percent 
from year-earlier levels, according to the Merrill Lynch retail 
index. 
</P>
<P>
	The index, the investment firm's barometer of sales performance  
at department stores and discount chains, was up 2.9 percent in 
April compared with the same month last year. The index rose 8.4 
percent in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Some merchants, including Dayton Hudson and the Gap, were hurt  
by the early Easter holiday this year, which shifted most of the 
holiday buying into March. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite some hints of a slowdown, analysts remained confident  
that retailers would report healthy profit gains for the first 
quarter. Most will begin to release their earnings in the coming 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most retailers have had to make minimum markdowns to push out  
merchandise,'' said Walter Loeb, who runs the retail consulting 
firm Loeb Associates. ``I am very optimistic about this quarter and 
about the spring into summer season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, reported that sales  
from stores open at least a year rose 4.6 percent from a year 
earlier, while total sales rose 11.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales from stores open at least a year, known as same-store  
sales, are considered the most accurate measure of a retailer's 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Other retailers' reports:  
</P>
<P>
	--Sears: Same-store sales down 0.9 percent, total sales down 4.3  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Kmart: Same-store sales up 5.7 percent, total sales up 7.3  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--J.C. Penney: Same-store department store sales fell 0.2  
percent, same-store sales at Eckerd drugstores rose 7.7 percent, 
total sales rose 6.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dayton Hudson: Same-store sales down 1.3 percent, total sales  
up 2.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Federated: Same-store sales rose 1.5 percent, total sales up  
12.9 percent. Federated's total sales included revenues from the 
Internet and catalog seller Fingerhut, which it acquired in March. 
</P>
<P>
	--May Department Stores: Same-store sales up 7.7 percent, total  
sales up 12.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Limited: Same-store sales up 5 percent, total sales were flat.  
</P>
<P>
	--Gap: Same-store sales up 1 percent, total sales up 21 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Ann Taylor: Same-store sales up 10.3 percent, total sales up  
17.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Kings Enter Playoffs With Bang  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- In the regular season's final two weeks,  
the Utah Jazz looked exhausted, while the Sacramento Kings looked 
like they were just getting started. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams will meet in the first round of the Western Conference  
playoffs starting Saturday at the Delta Center. Though the Jazz are 
among the favorites to contend for the first NBA title in the 
post-Jordan era, the upstart Kings are among the NBA's hottest 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been playing really well in the last couple of weeks,  
and we haven't,'' Utah guard John Stockton said. ``They've been a 
tough matchup for us this year. We'll have to improve our play if 
we don't want to get embarrassed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With one of the league's most exciting young lineups and 10  
victories in the last 11 games, the Kings roared into the playoffs 
with a 99-95 defeat of Vancouver Wednesday night. Sacramento 
clinched the sixth seed in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told the team at halftime they deserved to be the sixth  
seed, and they had to go out and get it done,'' first-year Kings 
coach Rick Adelman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Jazz stumbled to the finish, blowing homecourt  
advantage throughout the playoffs by going 5-5 in their final 10 
games. Fatigue was undoubtedly a factor: Utah closed the season 
with 22 games in 36 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way we're playing, anybody we got matched up with would  
have been difficult for us,'' Utah coach Jerry Sloan said. 
``They're a lot better team than they were even last year, and they 
could have beaten us three times this season. They have to feel 
pretty good about their chances against us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teams met three times during the regular season, and all  
three games went to overtime. The Jazz won two of the games, though 
they needed five free throws from Karl Malone and a missed 
wide-open layup by Lawrence Funderburke in the final minute of 
regulation to steal a 120-112 overtime victory on Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Sloan, who has lamented the abbreviated season's lack of  
practice time, ran his team through a difficult workout on Thursday 
morning and planned to do the same Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told them to tape up real good,'' Sloan said. ``We've needed  
a couple hard practices for quite a while now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though Utah still finished with the league's best record at  
37-13, the San Antonio Spurs matched that mark and won the No. 1 
seed in the West by beating Utah 2-1 in the season series. Utah 
slipped to third, but would have homecourt advantage in a series 
against any team except San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	Sacramento, which led the league in scoring this season, held  
off Phoenix and Minnesota for the sixth seed and just its second 
playoff appearance in the last 13 seasons. In Chris Webber and 
Jason Williams, the Kings have a power forward-point guard combo 
that reminds many of a more familiar duo in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a lot of respect for that team and what they're  
doing out there,'' Sloan said. ``They're trying to build a winner, 
and that's something we can understand in our organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nine of Utah's players have two trips to the NBA Finals on their  
resumes, and Todd Fuller is the only Jazz player with no playoff 
experience. The Kings have just five players -- Jon Barry, Vlade 
Divac, Vernon Maxwell, Scot Pollard and Webber -- who have ever been 
in a playoff game.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Action Figures Hot As Gov. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- If every doll has its day, then today  
belonged to Jesse Ventura's. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of action figures in the likeness of Minnesota's  
governor flew off shelves at the Mall of America on Thursday, their 
first day in stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``What a grandmother won't do for her grandchildren,'' said Mary  
Lou Carlson, a Bloomington woman who bought the first four action 
figures around 9:30 a.m. at the megamall in suburban Bloomington. 
</P>
<P>
	The action figures became popular during Ventura's upstart  
campaign for governor. In one of the unusual television ads that 
helped him win, two boys were depicted playing with a Ventura doll 
who banged his fist on a desk and dismissed Evil Special Interest 
Man. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlson and dozens of other shoppers began lining up outside  
Pady Regnier's gift shop around 9 a.m. for the dolls' debut. Nearly 
3,000 action figures were sold in the first few hours the store was 
open, Regnier said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're mobbed,'' she said. ``I'm running out of SEALS and  
coaches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The action figures come in three outfits. The ``SEAL'' is an  
action figure of Ventura dressed in fatigues from his days in the 
Navy. 
</P>
<P>
	The other two figures have Ventura dressed as a high school  
football coach -- he volunteers his services as conditioning coach 
at Champlin Park High School in Brooklyn Park -- and Ventura in a 
suit, his usual attire for his new job. Each doll costs $19.95. 
</P>
<P>
	After Ventura's election in November, entrepreneur Steve  
Tierschel created his own toy company and began manufacturing the 
action figures. Tierschel made the action figures in cooperation 
with Ventura for Minnesota Inc., a nonprofit company created by the 
governor to monitor and authorize use of his name and likeness on 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the company has contracts for Ventura action figures,  
pants, T-shirts, baseball caps, key chains and refrigerator 
magnets. 
</P>
<P>
	Any royalties due to Ventura's company from sales of the action  
figures will go to charity. 
</P>
<P>
	Tierschel said more than 70,000 action figures have been  
produced. The toys were distributed Thursday among five gift shops 
in the mall, but in coming weeks they will be available at larger 
retail outlets around Minnesota and the rest of the country, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Wodele, a spokesman for Ventura, referred questions to VMI,  
saying the figures are separate from the governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
	The action figures are not a first for Ventura.  
</P>
<P>
	He said profits from a doll in his likeness during his pro  
wrestling days paid for his first Porsche.

<HEADLINE> Barney's Tabs Former Federated CEO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Three months after emerging from bankruptcy,  
Barney's has hired the former top executive of Federated Department 
Stores to lead the clothing retailer's revival bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Barney's announced Wednesday that Allen Questrom will be its new  
CEO, replacing Tom Shull, who earlier this year said he planned to 
leave the high-end merchant. 
</P>
<P>
	Questrom, 59, joined Barney's board of directors in January, two  
years after he retired from Federated, where he worked for more 30 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, after a two-year stint as the head of Dallas-based  
Neiman Marcus, Questrom returned to Federated as chairman and CEO, 
guiding the Cincinnati-based retailer out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
reorganization. He also presided over a period of major growth as 
Federated bought R.H. Macy &AMP; Co. Inc. and Broadway Stores Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``Questrom proved himself to be a miracle worker at Federated,''  
said Kurt Barnard, who publishes Barnard's Retail Trend Report. 
``He is a man with great vision and the ability to execute that 
vision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barney's will be better served than ever before.''  
</P>
<P>
	Questrom is receiving no salary and will be compensated with  
equity in the company, according to officials for Barney's new 
owners, Bay Harbour Management and Whippoorwill Associates. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in the 1920s in New York City by the Pressman family,  
Barney's evolved into a retailer known for expensive merchandise 
and a hip, urban clientele. It's not unusual for Barney's shoppers 
to find $500 jeans and $2,000 suits from top designers such as Jil 
Sander and Gucci. 
</P>
<P>
	But the company ran into financial trouble in the 1990s as it  
launched an aggressive expansion plan. By 1996, it was forced to 
file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Barney's emerged from bankruptcy in January under Shull, a  
former executive with Meridian Ventures Inc., which had been hired 
two years earlier to help shore up the company's finances. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pressman family, which ran Barney's until last year, no  
longer has an active role at the company. 
</P>
<P>
	When Shull announced plans to leave at the end of May, there  
were reports that Barney's was looking for a leader with both 
strong merchandising and financial skills. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that Barney's will have a total revitalization under  
his leadership,'' said Walter Loeb, who runs the retail consulting 
firm Loeb Associates. ``Barney's has always been a meeting point 
for the elite, and I think he will use that to help them grow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barney's now owns seven stores and 13 outlet shops.

<HEADLINE> Legion Backs US Pullout From Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The American Legion is urging the Clinton  
administration to apply lessons learned in Vietnam and devise a 
clear military mission or immediately withdraw U.S. soldiers from 
the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our troops are not pawns in a chess game. They are our sons  
and daughters,'' said Harold L. ``Butch'' Miller, the national 
commander of the nation's largest veterans organization. ``They 
must not be sent into harm's way. If they are, it must be upon 
careful reflection by their commander in chief, and the consent of 
Congress and the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The legion's national executive committee voted 65-0 on  
Wednesday to approve a resolution calling for the withdrawal of 
troops unless Clinton provides a clear statement of U.S. interests 
and establishes campaign guidelines, including an exit strategy. It 
also urged Congress to pass a formal resolution supporting the 
military action and called for U.S. forces to be commanded only by 
U.S. officers. 
</P>
<P>
	It's an unprecedented move for the group, with about 2.9 million  
American veterans. The Legion had questioned some actions prior to 
U.S. involvement in Vietnam, but never called for troop 
withdrawals, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's experience in Vietnam influenced several committee  
members who felt the organization should have taken a stronger 
position then, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wisdom we have from Vietnam must be employed now,'' said  
Miller, a 51-year-old Vietnam veteran from Woodbridge, Va., whose 
son is serving in Operation Allied Force on a relief effort in 
Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	The legion supported Operation Desert Storm because troops had  
clear goals and all the resources they needed to complete their 
mission, legion members said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Russia and Western powers agreed on a common  
approach to seeking peace for Kosovo, including terms for an armed 
international force to secure the return of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said even with a possible peace accord near, the troops  
won't be safe until they are out of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We support the troops 100 percent,'' Miller said. ``That's the  
best we can do for anybody's son over there -- including mine.''

<HEADLINE> UMass Lacrosse Player Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOLYOKE, Mass. (AP) -- Medical investigators hope an autopsy can  
help explain the death of a University of Massachusetts lacrosse 
player who collapsed when hit in the chest with a ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Sopracasa, 21, of Farmingville, N.Y., stopped breathing  
when he was struck during practice Wednesday afternoon on the 
Amherst campus, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was revived briefly and taken to Cooley Dickinson Hospital in  
Northampton. But he later died there, according to Jo-Anne Vanin, 
an associate vice chancellor for student affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Loren Mednick of Holyoke, a medical examiner, conducted an  
autopsy Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mednick listed the death as apparently accidental, but he did  
not issue a preliminary finding on a cause. It wasn't clear if the 
student's death could have involved any underlying cause, and the 
medical examiner did not plan a final report until toxicological 
and other tests are completed. 
</P>
<P>
	The junior was a clothing marketing major and a starting  
defensive midfielder for the lacrosse team. 
</P>
<P>
	Sopracasa, who was an All-American at Sachem High School in  
Farmingville, had apparently been in good health, university 
spokeswoman Kay Scanlan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Greg Canella, who met with the team for more than two  
hours Thursday, wept as he read a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eric was a great kid, a great teammate, a great supporter,''  
Canella said. 
</P>
<P>
	The team, which has a record of 4-8, was scheduled to play its  
final game of the season against Brown in Rhode Island on Saturday. 
On Thursday night, however, the team decided not to play the game. 
</P>
<P>
	No college player has died from a lacrosse injury since at least  
1982, according to surveys by the National Center for Catastrophic 
Sports Injury Research at the University of North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	But one college lacrosse player died of a heart attack during an  
offseason practice, according to the survey. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's incredibly tragic, but it's extremely rare,'' said Steve  
Steersen, director of U.S. Lacrosse, the national governing body 
for men's and women's lacrosse. 
</P>
<P>
	A lacrosse ball, which is made of hard rubber and weighs five  
ounces, can reach speeds of 80 mph when shot, Steersen said. 
</P>
<P>
	He had never heard of a player of any age dying from being  
struck in the chest. ``Players, especially defensemen, often get 
hit,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, doctors have found that even a moderate blow of a ball  
to the chest, if struck at precisely the wrong moment in the 
heartbeat cycle, can be fatal, said Dr. Adolph Hutter, past 
president of the American College of Cardiology and a cardiologist 
for the New England Patriots and Boston Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although it is extremely rare, it is the most common cause of  
sudden death in athletes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the blow causes the heart to quiver rather than beat  
steadily. ``The only way to get it back is to shock the person,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most cases have involved baseballs, he said, leading some  
doctors to urge softer balls and chest protectors for children in 
youth leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutter did not know of any instances in lacrosse, but said cases  
have also been reported in softball, karate, football, and hockey.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Airline Seeks Injunction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Alaska Airlines filed suit in federal court  
today, seeking an injunction against a mechanics union and damages 
related to hundreds of forced flight cancellations since mid-April. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline said it has been forced to cancel more than 300  
flights for maintenance-related reasons. It alleges the job 
slowdown was orchestrated by members of the Aircraft Mechanics 
Fraternal Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The union, which represents 1,100 mechanics, referred all  
questions to Scott Petersen, a New York lawyer. He could not be 
reached for comment late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The union has previously denied any knowledge of a work  
slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``These problems were a result of normal operational wear and  
tear, and all were identified and addressed by maintenance 
personnel in a timely, conscientious manner,'' a recent union 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The carrier filed suit in U.S. District Court, seeking a  
permanent injunction against the union that would preclude illegal 
job actions. The airline also seeks unspecified damages. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're asking the courts to step in and order the union to  
compel its members to stop the slowdown,'' airline spokesman Jack 
Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 70 flights -- 27 on Thursday and 47 on Wednesday -- have  
been canceled in the past two days, Evans said. The usual number of 
daily cancellations hovers around five, he said, adding that the 
union's denials are not credible. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's hard not to know about (the slowdown),'' he  
said. ``We're an airline with the youngest fleet in the nation. 
It's hard to have problems of such nature that it would take so 
long to repair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alaska Airlines schedules about 500 departures daily.  
</P>
<P>
	More than 10,000 travelers were affected when about 350 workers  
called in sick in mid-April. 
</P>
<P>
	All the airline's unions are negotiating contracts except  
pilots, whose most recent package was signed in 1997. Workers have 
complained that the talks are progressing slowly.

<HEADLINE>  Cleaves Not Leaving for NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- He could have followed the money.  
Instead, Mateen Cleaves followed his heart. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves, the point guard who led Michigan State to the NCAA  
tournament Final Four for the first time in 20 years last season, 
will stay in school next season rather than declare himself 
eligible for the NBA draft as an underclassman. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-2, 190-pound All-American from Flint made his  
announcement during a news conference Thursday at the Breslin 
Center, where he has led the Spartans to consecutive Big Ten 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the players on this team. I love Michigan State,''  
Cleaves said. ``I'm not ready to leave them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves had said after Michigan State's 68-62 loss to Duke in  
the national semifinals in March that he would stay in school. 
</P>
<P>
	``That last game left an empty feeling in my stomach,'' Cleaves  
said. ``This year, I want to bring it home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves is following the plan endorsed by Spartans coach Tom  
Izzo and by his mother, Fran Cleaves, who had said repeatedly she 
would like her son to finish work on his degree in communications. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you this is one of the happiest days of my life,''  
Fran Cleaves said. ``I want my son to get a college degree. My 
words to him were, `Do what your heart says, and listen to my 
heart, also.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Two of his peers -- Duke's Elton Brand, and Connecticut's Richard  
Hamilton -- already have decided to leave school early. But some NBA 
scouts believe Cleaves would be better off staying at Michigan 
State and working on his shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Chris Monter said Cleaves -- had he declared himself  
eligible for the draft -- probably would have been selected between 
15th and 20th in the first round of a draft fairly deep in point 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves, apparently aware of those reports, chafed at the  
suggestion that his game wasn't up to NBA standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do I think I can play in the NBA? Yes,'' Cleaves said.  
``Despite what people say, I'm not staying here to work on my game. 
I think I can play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the fact that he won Big Ten Player of the Year honors  
for the second straight season, Cleaves' scoring average dipped 
from 16.1 points per game in 1998 to 11.7. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there are few who can match Cleaves in clutch situations.  
</P>
<P>
	He scored the winning basket with 3.7 seconds remaining against  
Northwestern in the Big Ten tournament. Cleaves also hit the 
winning shot with 1.2 seconds left in a late-season game against 
Minnesota, and with four-tenths of a second remaining against Penn 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	With Cleaves back to run the show, the Spartans figure to be a  
threat to win the Big Ten championship again. They might also get 
another shot at their first NCAA title since Magic Johnson led the 
team to victory in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't imagine the sacrifice he's making,'' Izzo said. ``If  
he wanted to go, he'd be a millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a great day for Michigan State and for people  
around the country who are looking for a kid to be a role model.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There had been signs all along that he would remain in East  
Lansing. An example: Cleaves never registered with an agent, 
according to Pam Burke of the NBA Players Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a tough decision to tell you the truth,'' Cleaves  
said. ``My family and coaches just thought I ought to check 
everything out. The education is very important to me. I want my 
degree. I don't want to be known as just a jock.''

<HEADLINE> Volkswagen Sued for `Nazi Nursery' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- German automaker Volkswagen has been sued in  
federal court, accused in the deaths of up to 400 Russian and 
Polish children who were in a company-run nursery while their 
parents were forced to work during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Milwaukee on  
Wednesday, says the children died between 1943 and 1945 as a result 
of maltreatment and inhumane conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they had been German they would have been cared for,  
period,'' attorney Lyn Rahilly said. ``They were not cared for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Volkswagen's actions constitute ``genocide, war crimes and  
crimes against humanity,'' said the lawsuit, which seeks 
unspecified damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit lists only one plaintiff: 78-year-old Anna Snopczyk  
of Poland, whose 2-month-old baby died at the nursery. Rahilly said 
the lawyers hope the case would encourage others to come forward. 
</P>
<P>
	The nursery was established by Volkswagen to care for the babies  
of Polish and Russian forced laborers working at an automobile 
factory and neighboring farms in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Volkswagen A.G. reissued a statement first released in November  
after CBS News aired a report on the deaths. It ``is a tragic 
chapter from one of the darkest times of modern history,'' the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The widespread practice of forcing infants and children to be  
taken from their mothers and placed in special children's homes 
throughout Germany was another manifestation of the inhumanity of 
the Third Reich in World War II,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	A company spokesman said there would be no other comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Snopczyk, who worked at the factory, gave birth to a boy, Jozef,  
in February 1945. The nursery where her son was sent was infested 
with bugs and vermin, the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	No one told her what caused her son's death, the lawsuit said.  
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was based on information from war-crimes  
investigations and trial records, Rahilly said. It was filed in 
Milwaukee partly because of the area's large Polish population. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other lawsuits in the United States have been brought by  
former slave laborers against Volkswagen and other German 
companies, seeking compensation for their experiences during World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
	A lead attorney in the Volkswagen lawsuit filed Wednesday,  
Michael Hausfeld, also was involved in a $1.25 billion settlement 
with Swiss banks for Holocaust survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrea Kupfer Schneider, an assistant professor of law at  
Marquette University, said the Volkswagen case goes beyond previous 
cases that involved compensation for slave laborers or insurance 
claims for Holocaust survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Accusing a private company of genocide and war crimes is  
pretty unique,'' said Schneider, who teaches international law and 
human rights. ``It really asks the question as to how far you can 
take these cases.''

<HEADLINE> Cleaves Not Leaving for NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Michigan State point guard Mateen  
Cleaves will stay in school next season and not declare himself 
eligible for the NBA draft as an underclassman. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-2, 190-pound All-American made his announcement today  
at a news conference in East Lansing. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves had said after Michigan State's loss to Duke in national  
semifinals of the NCAA tournament that he would stay in school. 
Cleaves follows the plan endorsed by Spartans coach Tom Izzo and by 
his mother, Fran Cleaves, who had said repeatedly she would like 
her son to finish work on his degree in family community services. 
</P>
<P>
	``That last game left any empty feeling in my stomach. This  
year, I want to bring it home,'' Cleaves said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of his peers -- Duke's Elton Brand, and Connecticut's Richard  
Hamilton -- already decided to leave school early. But some NBA 
scouts believed Cleaves would be better off staying at Michigan 
State and working on his shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a tough decision to tell you the truth. My family  
and coaches just thought I ought to check everything out,'' Cleaves 
said. ``The education is very important to me. I want my degree. I 
don't want to be known as just a jock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the fact that he was the Big Ten player of the year for  
the second straight season, Cleaves saw his scoring average dip 
from 16.1 points per game in 1998 to 11.7 last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there are few who can match Cleaves in clutch situations.  
</P>
<P>
	He scored the winning basket with 3.7 seconds remaining against  
Northwestern in the Big Ten tournament. Cleaves also hit the 
winning shot with 1.2 seconds left in a late-season game against 
Minnesota, and with four-tenths of a second remaining against Penn 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	With Cleaves back to run the show, the Spartans figure to be a  
threat to win the Big Ten title again. They might also get another 
shot at their first NCAA title since Magic Johnson led the team to 
victory in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't imagine the sacrifice he's making. If he wanted to  
go, he'd be a millionaire,'' Izzo said. 
</P>
<P>
	But there had been signs that he would remain in East Lansing.  
An example: He never registered with an agent, according to Pam 
Burke of the NBA Players Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Coaches said Cleaves has been attending classes and  
participating in conditioning and individual workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Doug Davis, Cleaves' backup and roommate,  
transferred to Miami of Ohio, hoping for more playing time. If 
Cleaves had left school early for the NBA, Davis likely would have 
stayed. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Chris Monter said if Cleaves -- if declaring himself  
eligible for the draft -- probably would have been selected between 
15th and 20th in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves had asked Izzo and his mother to do most of the research  
on where he would go in the draft.

<HEADLINE> Lockheed Leads Satellite Venture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lockheed Martin is leading a $3.6 billion  
satellite venture that will beam high-speed, high-capacity Internet 
and multimedia services to customers with small satellite dishes. 
</P>
<P>
	The joint venture with TRW and Telecom Italia, named Astrolink,  
plans to launch the first of four satellites in 2002, providing 
service in Europe and North and South America beginning in 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	The next three satellites are to be launched at six-month  
intervals, expanding the network worldwide, the companies said in a 
press release Thursday. Another five satellites may be added to the 
system, depending on market demand. 
</P>
<P>
	The initiative by Lockheed, the big aerospace contractor based  
in Bethesda, Md., follows a similar project started by Hughes 
Electronics, a unit of General Motors Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Astrolink has been given initial $900 million in funding, with  
Lockheed Martin providing $400 million, and TRW and Telecom Italia 
providing $250 million apiece. Each company will hold a minority 
stake in the venture. 
</P>
<P>
	The system will carry high-speed data traffic for Internet,  
multimedia and corporate networks, the statement said, noting a 
forecast that the global market for broadband communications will 
grow to nearly $200 billion by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, by the consulting firm Booz-Allen &AMP; Hamilton, also  
predicted that space-based systems will capture 10-15 percent of 
that market. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite system would be differentiated from leased-line  
systems in that customers would pay only for the connection time 
and data transmission services they use, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	Celso Azevedo, a former executive for the satellite television  
service DirecTV, has been named president and chief executive of 
Astrolink. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have taken the lead in the race to deploy the first of a  
new generation of flexible, reliable, high speed, global wireless 
data services,'' said Azevedo. ``We are in active discussions with 
additional investors and service providers, and we plan to announce 
agreements with them in the near future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin will provide Astrolink's spacecraft, systems  
integration and launch services, with Lockheed Martin Global 
Telecommunications acting as one of Astrolink's service providers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland-based TRW will build the digital communications  
payloads for the satellites, and will have the opportunity to be an 
Astrolink service provider. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia will supply the worldwide ground systems for the  
venture and manage the satellite and network control systems. 
Telecom Italia will sell Astrolink services in Italy and through 
its affiliated companies in Europe and Latin America.

<HEADLINE> Citizens To Buy Part of State Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Citizens Financial Group will buy State Street  
Corp.'s commercial and retail banking business for $350 million in 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal strengthens the position of Citizens, a subsidiary of  
the Royal Bank of Scotland that started out as a small retail bank 
in Providence, R.I., but has grown its commercial lending portfolio 
from $1 billion to $5 billion in the past six years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something Citizens has always aspired to,'' said Lawrence  
K. Fish, chairman, president and CEO of Citizens. ``We'll have the 
opportunity to become a powerhouse in middle-market, small-business 
lending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Citizens is buying a loan portfolio that averaged $1.9 billion  
for 1998 and totaled $2.2 billion on March 31. The deal, which is 
subject to regulatory approval, also includes $1.6 billion in 
deposits, two branches in Quincy and two in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	About 300 State Street employees will move to Citizens as a  
result of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Boston-based State Street, the sale completes a  
transition that began in 1975. That was when State Street decided 
to focus on serving institutional investors worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The company now has more than $5 trillion in assets under  
custody, and manages $525 billion through its investment management 
arm. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition, which is Citizens' 16th, will transform the  
institution into a $21 billion financial services company. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Citizens will be overshadowed in the region by the  
financial services giant that will be created when Fleet Financial 
Services completes its acquisition of Bank Boston Corp., creating a 
company with about $180 billion in assets.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Fall / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices tumbled Thursday as Federal Reserve  
Chairman Alan Greenspan expressed concern over ``imbalances'' in 
the continued expansion of the U.S. economy. Yields reached their 
highest levels since last June. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond dropped 1 1/16  
point, or $1.06 1/4 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, shot up to 5.78 percent from 5.70 
percent late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's remarks at a banking conference in Chicago fueled  
concern that the Fed will raise interest rates in order to cool off 
the economy, although some analysts said they don't expect any 
immediate change. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher rates hurt the value of bonds and other investments that  
pay a fixed rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of most concern is how long this remarkable period of  
prosperity can be extended,'' Greenspan told an audience. ``There 
are imbalances in our expansion that, unless redressed, will bring 
this long run of strong growth and low inflation to a close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, Greenspan voiced concern over today's tight labor  
market. Unemployment now stands at a 29-year-low of 4.2 percent, 
far below the 6 percent level the Fed typically considers a sign of 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders also turned away from bonds as they anticipated the  
Labor Department's monthly unemployment report, due out Friday, 
will show continued job growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices plunged in the broader market as well. Prices of  
short-term Treasury securities were down 5/32 to 9/32 point. 
Intermediate maturities fell between 15/32 and 3/4 point, reported 
Bridge Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.60 percent as the  
discount remained unchanged at 4.48 percent. Six-month yields were 
4.67 percent, as the discount rose 0.02 percentage point to 4.50 
percent. One-year yields were 4.78 percent as the discount rose by 
0.04 percentage point from late Wednesday to 4.55 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 4.87 percent from 4.63 percent late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell to 122 20/32 from 123 3/32 Wednesday. 
The average yield to maturity rose to 5.34 percent from 5.31 
percent.

<HEADLINE> Police Sent to Indonesia Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LHOKSEUMAWE, Indonesia (AP) -- Riot police will be sent to  
restore order in northwestern Aceh province, Indonesia's military 
chief said Thursday, following the deaths of dozens of civilians 
this week in a clash between soldiers and villagers. 
</P>
<P>
	The reinforcements heading to Aceh, where separatist rebels have  
been fighting for years, would include bomb squads, said Gen 
Wiranto, who like many Indonesians uses only one name. 
</P>
<P>
	The new force, based in the capital, Jakarta, was set up to  
quell riots that have swept parts of Indonesia in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, troops searching for a kidnapped soldier in the  
village of Pulo Rungkom opened fire on a crowd of residents, some 
of whom carried rocks, knives and sticks. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of dead civilians -- many shot in the back -- rose to  
39 on Thursday with the death of a 32-year-old woman, said Basri A. 
Gani, a member of a fact-finding team set up by the local 
government investigating military atrocities in Aceh. 
</P>
<P>
	The military said civilians in the crowd fired first, forcing  
soldiers to shoot back in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, unidentified assailants with AK-47 rifles killed a  
police sergeant in the province. 
</P>
<P>
	After the fall of authoritarian President Suharto last year,  
Wiranto announced an end to a nearly decade-long operation against 
the rebel Free Aceh Movement. But anti-military violence escalated 
and troops resumed operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiranto said he hoped that the riot police force would be able  
to create a peaceful environment ahead of parliamentary elections 
on June 7. Some separatists plan to boycott the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to take precautions to prevent further violence,''  
Wiranto said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, about two dozen troops removed pro-independence  
banners and cleaned graffiti from streets and walls. 
</P>
<P>
	Other troops dismantled two ``humanitarian-posts'' where  
students solicited money and collected testimony about the 
shooting. The students had rebuilt the posts after authorities took 
them apart for the first time on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Aceh, about 1,100 miles northwest of Jakarta, is one of three  
provinces where separatists are active. The other two are the 
former Portuguese colony of East Timor and Irian Jaya, a former 
Dutch colony in western New Guinea.

<HEADLINE> Next on `Springer': Knicks vs. Heat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	There is no truth to the rumor that Jerry Springer put in a  
last-minute bid for the the television rights to the NBA's 
first-round playoff series between the Knicks and Heat. For one 
thing, Springer couldn't keep a straight face long enough to utter 
the disclaimer Miami coach Pat Riley did. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think,'' Riley said Wednesday night, ``both teams have  
matured, hopefully, out of past transgressions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said this right after New York beat Miami 101-88 in a  
regular-season finale that proved absolutely nothing. Both Riley 
and Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy held important big and little men 
out of the game -- Alonzo Mourning and Tim Hardaway for the Heat, 
Patrick Ewing and Chris Childs for the Knicks. And even before it 
ended, Philadelphia beat Detroit in overtime to guarantee a New 
York-Miami postseason meeting for the third year running. 
</P>
<P>
	Considering the history of the matchup -- a 1997 melee resulted  
in six suspensions; the 1998 version produced three more and a 
priceless clip of Van Gundy clinging to Alonzo Mourning's leg and 
being dragged across the floor like a well-dressed mop -- Riley was 
smart enough to hedge his bets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now the fun starts,'' he said. ``You can never say something  
crazy isn't going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA and its network broadcast partner, NBC, would love to be  
able to say as much about the rest of their playoff series. The 
best chance for that to happen, at least in the opening round, will 
take place on the opposite coast, where the Lakers play host to the 
Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	Los-Angeles-Houston is the antithesis of New York-Miami. While  
the Heat and Knicks are ranked Nos. 1 and 3 in defense -- think of 
either squad as the Detroit Pistons of ``Bad Boys'' fame, but 
without the offense -- the Lakers are the NBA's best percentage 
shooting team at .467 and the Rockets are close at .437. 
</P>
<P>
	Needless to say, somebody is going to be very unhappy at the end  
of this series. The Rockets threw $13 million at Scottie Pippen to 
bring some of the Chicago Bulls mystique to Houston, but so far 
he's wound up on the outside of the offense looking in. The Lakers 
imported Dennis Rodman to do the same, but that chemistry 
experiment blew up in their face. What neither team figured out was 
that what put the Bulls over the top year after year was defensive 
prowess, and so the question running through this series, and the 
whole Western Conference side of the bracket, will be whether 
anybody has any real stopping power. 
</P>
<P>
	The obvious choice is Utah, since the Jazz were taken to school  
the last two finals by Michael Jordan and the Bulls. The Jazz, who 
drew Sacramento in the first round, continue to have trouble 
defending at the guard spot and could once more with rookie 
sensation Jason Williams matched up against John Stockton. But with 
Chris Webber, the Kings' most serious threat, hampered by a bad 
back, that one weakness won't cause Utah a serious problem. Neither 
will the guard tandem of Avery Johnson and Mario Elie at San 
Antonio, the only team in the West that figures to seriously extend 
the Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of watching the early rounds in the East, you might do  
yourself a favor and tune in to the NHL playoffs. The Detroit Red 
Wings and Colorado Avalanche will do just as much fighting as the 
Knicks and Heat, and chances are good that you'll even see more 
scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time you tune back to the NBA, you'll find the rested and  
ready Indiana Pacers, who actually did themselves a favor by 
failing to live up to expectations. By fading into the No. 2 seed, 
they drew a Milwaukee side just glad to be back in the playoffs for 
the first time since 1991 and ready to head for the exit. With a 
chance to catch its breath, Indiana will rediscover and rebuild the 
defense that extended Chicago to seven games in the conference 
finals last year. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the brackets are narrowed to two teams, expect the  
Jazz and Pacers -- just about everybody's preseason favorites -- to 
be there. Because of the lockout, the NBA had to cram a 50-game 
regular season into 89 nights, but all that concentrated effort 
proved is something that was apparent the last half-dozen seasons: 
The way to win a championship is to build a veteran squad and learn 
from the mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	What could ultimately determine the winner is homecourt  
advantage. The Pacers' Larry Bird, as shrewd a coach as he was a 
player, has been putting that message out all season and he argued 
his case in the newspapers in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been hearing from these guys that it doesn't bother them  
to go on the road in the playoffs,'' Bird said. ``We'll see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So we will.  
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Marciano Kin Upset by Boxing Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROCKTON, Mass. (AP) -- A new movie about boxing champion Rocky  
Marciano has angered family members, who claim it falsely portrays 
Marciano as a mob-connected fighter desperate to leave his hometown 
of Brockton. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy comes at the start of a monthlong celebration of  
Marciano in Brockton, which will end on May 27 with the release of 
a U.S. Postal Service stamp of Marciano. 
</P>
<P>
	Marciano was the only heavyweight champion to retire undefeated.  
He died in a 1969 plane crash. 
</P>
<P>
	One scene in the movie, which premieres May 15 on the Showtime  
cable network, shows Marciano being scolded by Frank Carbo, an 
organized crime figure with close ties to boxing. Carbo comments on 
Marciano's lackluster win over Roland LaStarza, and says he'd 
better improve or ``I'll drop you like a bad habit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another scene has Marciano telling a friend that Brockton hurt  
his father, and he wants to get out before it hurts him. 
</P>
<P>
	Marciano's family members said the mob-connection implications  
and a dislike of Brockton were just two of numerous factual errors 
in the movie. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult to sit and watch and see things and you'd say,  
that's a lie, that's not factual,''' Rocky Marciano Jr. told The 
Enterprise of Brockton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Speaking on behalf of the family, we don't want the people of  
Brockton to think the Marciano family in any shape or form had 
anything to do with this movie,'' said the fighter's brother, Peter 
Marciano. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie was made by Columbia Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer  
Inc., which defended the film in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The producers have drawn from many sources to tell the story  
of one of the most celebrated and colorful figures in the history 
of sports,'' the MGM statement read. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement continued: ``The film has effectively captured the  
extraordinary spirit and accomplishments of Marciano's personal and 
professional life.''

<HEADLINE> Mark Tuinei Was Cowboys Role Model </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- He was back-alley tough and choir-boy  
gentle. 
</P>
<P>
	He was church-parson nice and Jay Leno-funny. At 6-foot-5 and  
320 pounds, he was a jolly Hawaiian giant who could block the 
meanest defensive lineman the NFL could muster. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the kind of player who was a role model to one and all.  
</P>
<P>
	He was Mark Tuinei, 39, who won three Super Bowl rings while  
protecting the health of Troy Aikman and Emmitt Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Tuinei was found dead in his car.  
</P>
<P>
	``My job is easy,'' Tuinei used to say. ``I can protect myself.  
Troy and Emmitt have to hold a football while somebody is trying to 
kill them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuinei, who played 15 years for the Dallas Cowboys before bad  
knees retired him last year, showed up at the Thousand Oaks, 
Calif., training camp in 1983 with 84 other rookies. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas scouts first noticed him when he played for the  
University of Hawaii. Tuinei's tenacity earned him a job with the 
Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
	``We like the big Hawaiian kid as a defensive line prospect,''  
said personnel director Gil Brandt. ``He could develop into a good 
one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As it turned out, Tuinei was one of the best and toughest  
offensive linemen the Cowboys have ever produced. 
</P>
<P>
	He finally made the Pro Bowl in 1994, although his teammates  
already knew he was their MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuinei's job at left tackle was to protect Aikman from blindside  
blitzes, which he did expertly, and help grind out holes for Smith 
to run through. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tui,'' as the players called him, did it all then laughed  
about it in the dressing room after the game, win or lose. 
</P>
<P>
	And he never, ever turned down an autograph seeker.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was Tui's nature to be nice to every human being he meets  
unless they have a different colored jersey,'' teammate Bill Bates 
once said. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach became friends with  
Tuinei and said, ``We just all loved the guy. He was just a gentle 
giant. He was just one of those unsung players that goes out and 
does their job. He was one of those kind of players every team 
needs. He was a role model for the NFL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He was like a big teddy bear,'' said former teammate Mike  
Saxon. ``He loved everybody and everybody loved him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The press certainly did, and forgave him for having a name that  
was hard to spell. Many times he was the only player who would show 
at Valley Ranch after a tough loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gentlemen, how can I help you?'' Tuinei would smile.  
</P>
<P>
	Teammates admired Tuinei for his toughness and ability to play  
hurt. He suffered knee injuries almost every year he played with 
the Cowboys, yet he would suit up on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Back spasms finally got the best of him in 1994, causing him to  
miss a game. 
</P>
<P>
	The injuries forced him to retire last year and Dallas had to  
switch guard Larry Allen to his position to keep Aikman from 
getting pounded. 
</P>
<P>
	For an offensive lineman who doesn't get much publicity, Tuinei  
had a million friends. His sudden death was a shock to anyone who 
knew him or saw him play. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a big loss for the city of Dallas,'' Saxon said.  
</P>
<P>
	It couldn't have been said better.

<HEADLINE> Highlights of Bankruptcy Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Highlights of legislation to rewrite the bankruptcy laws passed  
Wednesday by the House: 
</P>
<P>
	--Establishes a ``means test,'' based on debtors' income, to  
determine whether they must gradually repay their debts or may 
erase them entirely while under Bankruptcy Court protection from 
creditors. The provision uses the Internal Revenue Service's 
standards to determine how much money debtors need to live. It 
requires debtors with incomes above regional median levels, minus 
money needed for living expenses, to follow court-ordered repayment 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	--Gives highest priority among debts to child support and alimony  
payments, putting them ahead of credit card debt and other 
obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	--Requires credit card companies to clearly disclose their  
late-payment fees and how long it would take customers to pay off 
balances by making only minimum monthly payments. The companies 
also would have to clearly reveal the expiration dates of 
introductory ``teaser rates'' and the higher interest rates 
replacing them. The same disclosures would have to be made in 
offers for credit card accounts made over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	--Limits repeat bankruptcy filings.

<HEADLINE> Post-Jordan Playoffs Set To Begin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Contrary to popular belief, the player who took the final shot  
of last year's NBA Finals has not retired. 
</P>
<P>
	And no, his shot did not go in.  
</P>
<P>
	Long forgotten by the masses who watched Michael Jordan hit his  
final shot in Game 6 last June is the fact that John Stockton had a 
chance to win the game at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
	His final try barely missed, Jordan had his career-defining  
moment and the two future Hall of Famers in Utah went another year 
without a championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``That wouldn't have won the series, but it would have given us  
another chance to win the championship -- which is a lot better than 
the way it turned out,'' Stockton said. ``I liked our chances in 
the next game, but that's easy to say now. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's over with, and it won't do much good to dwell on it. I  
had an opportunity to make the shot and it didn't quite go. But I'd 
take it again if it happened again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stockton and his running mate, Karl Malone, are a long way from  
having it happen again. It'll take 11 wins before they can reach 
the finals again to have another chance to capture the title that 
has eluded them throughout their otherwise stellar careers. 
</P>
<P>
	Another year older, with Stockton, Malone and Jeff Hornacek on  
the last years of their contracts and no longer the No. 1 seeded 
team in the West, the Jazz will have to work their way through a 
postseason that looks an awful lot different than it did last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The absence of Jordan, of course, is the biggest change of all.  
</P>
<P>
	But scattered throughout both conferences are a number of  
younger, quicker, uppity teams who believe their chances are as 
good as anyone's in this first year of the post-Jordan era. 
</P>
<P>
	No team signifies this change-in-progress era quite as much as  
Utah's first-round opponent, the Sacramento Kings -- the highest 
scoring team in the NBA this season and one of the funnest to 
watch. 
</P>
<P>
	Assembled from a cast of characters that includes a flashy,  
tattoo-adorned rookie point guard with a politically incorrect 
nickname (Jason ``White Chocolate'' Williams), a Serbian center who 
has been through past playoff wars (Vlade Divac), a man-child power 
forward with a checkered past (Chris Webber) and a loose cannon 
shooting guard coming off the bench who once helped the Houston 
Rockets to a title (Vernon Maxwell). 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a lot of respect for that team and what they're  
doing out there,'' coach Jerry Sloan said. ``They're trying to 
build a winner, and that's something we can understand in our 
organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings and Jazz open their best-of-5 first-round series on  
Saturday -- one of four series that begin that day. The Heat and 
Knicks renew their rivalry in the day's first game, and the other 
matchups are Phoenix-Portland and Detroit-Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The other four series -- Philadelphia-Orlando, Minnesota-San  
Antonio, Houston-L.A. Lakers and Milwaukee-Indiana -- begin Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	All around the league, players and coaches are eagerly awaiting  
a chance to head into the postseason knowing that Jordan and the 
Bulls no longer stand in the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll miss it,'' said Scottie Pippen, who moved on to the  
Rockets in the breakup of the Bulls that commenced when the lockout 
ended in January. ``It certainly feels different this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Rodman is the only longtime former member of the Bulls  
who will sit out this year's playoffs, having blown through bad 
behavior his chance to go into the postseason with the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Luc Longley is with the Suns, Steve Kerr is in San Antonio and  
Jud Buechler is with the Pistons -- and none of them is with a team 
that can be easily written off in the first or second rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what everyone used to do with the Spurs, whose reputation  
for softness melted away this season as the team brought in 
playoff-tested veterans Kerr, Jerome Kersey and Mario Elie. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team is farther along than any team I've ever been on,''  
said David Robinson, a 10-year veteran. ``So I'm excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio ended the season with victories in 31 of its final  
36 games to win the No. 1 seed in the West and homecourt advantage 
throughout the postseason. With Tim Duncan a year older and now the 
No. 1 option on offense, there are few teams that can stop San 
Antonio's front line. 
</P>
<P>
	The Miami Heat are the team sitting atop the East, and their  
first order of business will be to keep their tempers in check and 
maintain their overachieving ways as they play their fiercest 
rivals, the Knicks, in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be the third straight year that the Heat and Knicks  
have played in the postseason, and the last two series were 
dramatically altered by late-game fights. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams are preaching calm this time, but that's what they  
did last year up until the moment when Alonzo Mourning and Larry 
Johnson started throwing punches. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both teams are going to want to win desperately, and both  
teams have the same objective,'' Heat coach Pat Riley said. ``I do 
think, based on experience, that there should be some growth, some 
maturity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both teams have been burned enough in the postseason -- two  
years ago New York, and last year us -- so maybe this might be the 
real deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only six victories separated the No. 1 team in the East from the  
eighth team, so there is little difference between the top and 
bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Iverson's Philadelphia 76ers, for example, manhandled the  
third-seeded Orlando Magic in two of their three games during the 
regular season and literally threw away a victory in the third 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson enters the postseason as the league's leading scorer  
looking to prove that he can be a playoff performer to be reckoned 
with. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only my third year,'' Iverson said. ``I think the problem  
with me coming in was that people looked at my talents and they 
didn't want to let me grow as a basketball player and as a person. 
I think over time, maybe people will start to understand me and 
some of the critics will back off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The East features other various sideshows, the weirdest of which  
is where to play Games 4 and 5 of the Atlanta-Detroit series. The 
Palace of Auburn Hills is booked for a concert next Friday when the 
Pistons are scheduled to host Game 4, and the Georgia Dome is 
booked for a concert the following Monday -- the night of Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
	The games might be moved to the Silverdome and Georgia Tech's  
Alexander Memorial Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indiana Pacers might have to deal with the distraction of  
coach Larry Bird being questioned on whether he'll return to coach 
next year. There has been steady speculation that assistant coach 
Rick Carlisle might take over the team next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to get into this, because it's the players' team  
and they have a great opportunity to do something nice (in the 
playoffs), probably the best they'll ever have,'' Bird said. ``I 
want all the focus to be on the team. It has nothing to do with 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers, of course, have been a sideshow all year -- signing  
and releasing Dennis Rodman, firing Del Harris, trading Elden 
Campbell and Eddie Jones for Glen Rice, watching Kobe Bryant 
freelance to the detriment of O'Neal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It depends which Lakers team shows up. If they have their  
heads on straight, we'll have the toughest series of anybody,'' 
Houston's Charles Barkley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Portland Trail Blazers, after contending for the best  
leaguewide record until the final few days, must cope with their 
first bout of on-the-court adversity this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Making matters worse, Isaiah Rider has regularly been showing up  
tardy lately -- just the latest of Rider's many behavioral episodes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our biggest opponent right now is ourselves,'' backup point  
guard Greg Anthony said. ``The commitment is not there. We've got 
too many agendas right now. If we don't address them before the 
playoffs, we're going to have a very short run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the great miscnceptions of past seasons was that the  
Bulls were beatable in a seven-game series. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe they were vulnerable, but never beatable.  
</P>
<P>
	As for that misconception about last year's last shot, Stockton  
was asked whether nine of 10 people would answer ``Jordan'' when 
asked who took the final shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's probably right, yeah.  
</P>
<P>
	``But I'm not finished yet. As long as I have a chance and this  
team is kicking, it doesn't mean anything at all.''

<HEADLINE> Panel: Sales Over Security Pushed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- China gained valuable missile-related  
technology from U.S. contractors because of weak oversight and a 
permissive export policy during the Clinton administration, a 
bipartisan Senate report concludes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Intelligence Committee report also said the Reagan  
and Bush administrations contributed to policies that allowed space 
technology to flow to China. The report was to be released Friday. 
A copy was obtained Thursday by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Clinton administration, the report said, U.S.  
contractors conducted detailed technical reviews of Beijing rocket 
technology with little or no U.S. national security supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such (technology) transfer enables the Peoples Republic of  
China to improve its present and future technical know-how,'' the 
report concluded. ``The committee further finds that improvements 
to the PRC's space launch capability increases the PRC's ability to 
use space for military reconnaissance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee said it reviewed intelligence reports dating to  
the 1980s that said China ``has had a strategic, coordinated effort 
to collect technological products and information from the U.S. 
government and private companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The panel was careful to say it has found no evidence that China  
has incorporated technology gained from U.S. contractors into its 
current ICBM force, which predates the policies allowing export of 
U.S. satellites to China. 
</P>
<P>
	But the report said revenue from U.S. companies buying Chinese  
launch services funded improvements in Chinese rockets which were 
virtually interchangeable for military or commercial purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. intelligence, meanwhile, is closely monitoring expected  
deployment within a few years of new Chinese missile systems with 
improved capability. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman David Leavy said President Clinton has  
already approved steps recommended by the committee to strengthen 
security oversight of satellite exports. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have strong controls to monitor the commercial satellite  
launches but we are concerned, as is the committee, that 
unauthorized transfers could assist China,'' Leavy said. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that allegations regarding those transfers and the  
possible role of U.S. contractors is under investigation by the 
Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The 45-page report, which was approved in a near-unanimous vote  
by the committee, contains a short section on China's efforts to 
influence U.S. political campaigns with illegal campaign 
contributions. It said China's efforts were targeted at both 
Republicans and Democrats. U.S. intelligence developed reliable 
information on the Chinese campaign but was unable to conclude the 
level of coordination among the Chinese leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	While finding no specific wrongdoing by the Clinton  
administration, the report cited ``inadequate communication and 
coordination'' within U.S. agencies about the Chinese effort. 
</P>
<P>
	On satellite issues, the report found that decisions easing  
export rules by both Clinton and Bush ``emphasized commercial 
interests over national security.'' Both administrations failed to 
adequately fund satellite export security teams that would monitor 
interaction between U.S. contractors and Chinese officials, the 
panel concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	Its report Hughes Electronics provided China with valuable  
technical information without U.S. government oversight following 
the 1995 crash of a Chinese rocket. 
</P>
<P>
	Loral Space &AMP; Communications did the same following a Chinese  
rocket crash the following year, also without U.S. government 
monitoring, the report said. The information given China ``applies 
equally to space launch vehicles and ballistic missiles,'' it 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of inadequate U.S. security prior to the failed Loral  
launch in 1996, ``certain key facilities were not guarded,'' the 
report said. ``Classified materials were left unattended (and) 
security officials did not adequately determine the nationality of 
foreign technicians working in sensitive site areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Martin Marietta engineers helped China address problems  
with satellite ``kick motors'' that can power satellites into a 
higher orbit but may also be used to propel missile warheads, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for Loral and Lockheed Martin Corp., successor to  
Martin Marietta, did not immediately return calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes spokesman Richard Dore said, ``Hughes does not believe it  
was ever in the position of passing on any type of security 
information or anything that would compromise a national security 
situation'' to China. 
</P>
<P>
	Dore said Hughes abided by rules in effect at the time it  
conducted its technical reviews on Chinese space issues.

<HEADLINE> FAA, Union OK Limit on Free Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Free airline flights that some air traffic  
controllers used for personal trips will have new controls under an 
agreement between the government and the nation's largest air 
traffic controller union. 
</P>
<P>
	The cornerstone of the deal between the Federal Aviation  
Administration and the National Air Traffic Controllers' 
Association is that ``familiarization'' flights must now be 
proposed in writing, approved by a supervisor and meet a defined 
training objective. 
</P>
<P>
	On such trips, controllers are allowed to fly in airline  
cockpits, ostensibly to observe flight crews and see the other end 
of air traffic control conversations. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, there had been no such controls on the flights,  
leading to criticism that controllers were using them to take 
vacations, visit relatives or conduct other personal business. 
</P>
<P>
	Other elements of the agreement, which takes effect May 31, are:  
</P>
<P>
	--The number of flights will be limited to six roundtrips  
annually, down from a current maximum of nine. 
</P>
<P>
	--Controllers can take no more than two trips to the same  
airport, as opposed to the previous limit of eight. 
</P>
<P>
	--All flights must be made on duty time, unlike the previous  
limit of five trips on duty time. 
</P>
<P>
	--In order to take an international flight, a controller must  
handle international departures or oceanic airspace as part of his 
normal duties. 
</P>
<P>
	--The FAA and the controllers union will meet annually to ensure  
that there is adequate tracking and adherence to the new 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although there were problems with the program in the past, all  
parties agreed that the FAM program is a legitimate and valuable 
training tool,'' FAA spokesman Fraser Jones said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the new rules ``meet the training requirements as well  
as the test of ethics laws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Schwitz, executive vice president of the controllers  
union, believes the program is a valuable one and he is pleased 
with terms of the new agreement, according to union spokeswoman 
Maureen McGaffin. 
</P>
<P>
	In February 1996, the inspector general of the Transportation  
Department released an audit saying that FAA personnel took 247,840 
free flights in the cabins or cockpits of commercial airliners 
between January 1993 and April 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The office estimated that 62 percent of the evaluators and 35  
percent of safety inspectors used their free-flight privileges to 
take vacations or visit families.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Players Insist They Overslept </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Six retired players who missed a flight returning  
the Cuban delegation from Baltimore following this week's game 
against the Orioles said today they simply overslept and never had 
any intention of trying to remain in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	One said U.S. officials tried to convince them to stay in the  
United States and criticized the only member of the 300-plus 
delegation who asked for asylum. All said they had not been 
pressured into returning, but they were not allowed to answer 
questions from reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I speak English, and they insisted that I stay in Washington  
and told me I wouldn't have any problems,'' said former player Juan 
Vives, describing conversations with U.S. immigration officials. 
``I told them I didn't have any problems in Cuba, either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The six spoke during a news conference in Havana. They left  
Washington on Wednesday, and arrived in Havana from Jamaica on 
Thursday, three days after the Cuban team beat the Orioles 12-6 in 
an exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitching coach Rigoberto Betancourt was the only member of the  
300-person delegation who requested asylum in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I'm concerned, he's crazy, he's sick in the head,''  
Vives said. 
</P>
<P>
	Former catcher Evelio Hernandez was a bit more forgiving.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing happens when somebody stays behind'' on trips abroad,  
Hernandez said. ``We're not attacking anybody because they returned 
or didn't return.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez said the group that missed the flight got an extra  
bonus -- they got to see the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came out winning because we got to tour Washington, but I  
am bothered by the speculation that circulated about us wanting to 
stay,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Tornado Family Tragedy Recounted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Beverly Arthur saw that her mother got a  
rose in a crystal vase the night the tornado came. It was important 
to her, and it was one of the last things she did before she was 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Arthur was one of the 38 people to die in Monday's tornado  
outbreak in Oklahoma. She had gathered her family together for 
dinner, first giving her mother the rose that husband Melvin Arthur 
had cut in the back yard. Her mother, Lois Madden, lived in the 
Arthur home. 
</P>
<P>
	The family watched the warnings on television before taking  
cover, fearing the tornado could hit their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we heard it, we got the pillows and headed for the  
hallway,'' Mrs. Madden recalled Wednesday as she recovered in a 
hospital. After the storm, Mrs. Madden said she was left with only 
half a pillow under her head. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I came to, I could hear the glass and wood still whirling  
around my head. I could hear the sucking,'' Mrs. Madden said. ``I 
felt I would die there. And that was OK, I was ready to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After regaining consciousness, Mrs. Madden could hear Mrs.  
Arthur, 51, calling to her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said, `I'm OK, I'm OK. Just go see about mother,''' Arthur  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said when he saw rescue workers pulling rubble off of his  
mother-in-law, he went back and found his wife was dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``She just looked gray. She had blood all over her legs,''  
Arthur said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was going to join her, I really wanted to join her,'' he  
said, his eyes filling with tears. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Madden, 70, talked about her loss from a bed in the same  
hospital where her daughter had a heart transplant two years ago. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Wynette's Widower Dropped From Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The widower of Tammy Wynette was dropped  
from a $50 million lawsuit brought by her daughters alleging he and 
the country music star's doctor were responsible for her death. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, my nightmare has ended,'' George Richey said at a news  
conference. He noted that Wednesday would have been Wynette's 57th 
birthday, and called it ``appropriate that we honored the occasion 
this way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed April 5 by three of Wynette's daughters --  
Tina Jones, Jackie Daly and Georgette Smith. Her fourth daughter, 
Gwen Nicholas, later joined the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The daughters have insisted the lawsuit is not motivated by  
money. Wynette left the bulk of her estate to Richey, her fifth 
husband, but her will stipulates it be divided among her four 
children and his two children when he dies. Anyone who challenges 
the terms gets nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	The daughters claim their mother's health wasn't monitored  
closely enough, and that she was given too many painkillers prior 
to her death on April 6, 1998. Dr. Wallis Marsh of Pittsburgh, 
Wynette's personal physician, was named along with Richey in the 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The daughters plan to continue seeking a judgment against Marsh,  
who has denied any wrongdoing and has Richey's support. 
</P>
<P>
	Richey did not pay the daughters to get them to drop him from  
the lawsuit, said his attorney, Robert Ritchie of Knoxville. 
</P>
<P>
	``George Richey did agree that he would not bring suit against  
the daughters for libel, slander or injury to reputation because of 
false statements made by them prior to May 5, 1999,'' Ritchie said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richey also agreed he would not share in any damages the  
daughters are awarded if Marsh loses the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Principally, (the daughters) did it because Mr. Richey gave up  
his one-third interest in the proceeds of the lawsuit,'' said Ed 
Yarbrough, an attorney for the daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Richey was a target of the lawsuit, by Tennessee law  
he would have gotten a third of any settlement or damages as an 
heir. 
</P>
<P>
	Yarbrough would not say if the daughters got anything else as  
part of the deal. They have complained in the past that Richey 
would not let them have any of Wynette's personal items. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be reasonable to assume there would be other  
inducements, but I am not allowed to comment,'' Yarbrough said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richey said he never wanted any part of settlement money or  
damages Marsh might have to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	``George believed -- and still believes -- that Dr. Marsh provided  
excellent medical care to Tammy during the last years of her life, 
enabling her to have some quality of life she would not have 
otherwise had,'' Ritchie said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wynette, who had 20 No. 1 hits and was perhaps best known for  
``Stand By Your Man,'' was 55 when she died. She had suffered from 
painful medical problems for many years, including scarring from 
several surgeries on her intestines. Marsh prescribed various drugs 
to help her cope with the constant pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Richey discovered Wynette's body in their Nashville home and  
Marsh flew in to sign the death certificate. He listed the cause of 
death as a blood clot to the lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Nashville Medical Examiner Bruce Levy declined a  
request by the daughters to have Wynette's body exhumed for an 
autopsy. But on April 14 the body was exhumed at the request of 
Richey, who said he wanted to resolve any lingering questions about 
the death. 
</P>
<P>
	No autopsy results have been released yet. Levy previously said  
he is confident he could determine what drugs were in Wynette's 
system at the time of her death but not sure he could determine the 
amounts of each drug.

<HEADLINE> Star Wars Buzz Hits Warp Speed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Now that a few people have actually seen the  
new ``Star Wars'' movie in special screenings, the hype has yielded 
to the buzz. And the buzz is ... well, don't expect a masterpiece, 
just a really good movie with cool special effects. 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, a certain summer blockbuster.  
</P>
<P>
	``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' was screened  
Tuesday night in eight North American cities for movie theater 
executives, their families, and -- apparently -- a bundle of ``Star 
Wars'' fans who somehow finagled some of the prized tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost immediately, early reviews hit cyberspace, followed by  
the reactions to the reviews, then the reactions to the reactions, 
along with all manner of claims, counterclaims, insults and 
soul-searching over the film, which opens nationwide May 19. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys, it's a movie!'' responded Tom Sherak, distribution head  
of 20th Century Fox, which is releasing the film for George Lucas. 
``It isn't the Bible! It's fun, it's enjoyable, it's escapism. But 
it's a movie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Uh huh.  
</P>
<P>
	In what was titled, ``What I believe to be the FIRST review  
anywhere on the Internet,'' Ronald Epstein wrote on his Home 
Theater Forum Web site (www.hometheaterforum.com) that while he was 
impressed, the movie may not satisfy hard-core ``Star Wars'' fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like 'Star Wars,' it smells like 'Star Wars' and it  
feels like 'Star Wars.' However, is it a 'Star Wars' that we are 
going to walk away satisfied with? Well ... perhaps, but not for 
everyone,'' Epstein wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	While the early amateur critics loved the action sequences and  
most of the effects, including what they found to be an incredible 
underwater sequence, some reviewers thought the 2-hour-plus movie 
dragged a bit in places, that it was a little too kid-oriented and 
that one of the computer-generated characters, Jar Jar Binks, was 
annoying. 
</P>
<P>
	Such views, however, were quickly countered by those who, like  
Jerry Rhoades on Home Theater Forum, found the movie to be 
``PHENOMENAL!!!!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't watch it to analyze and match other people's reviews and  
thoughts to the film, just sit back, relax and enjoy the ride,'' he 
said. ``I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a leading ``Star Wars'' Web site, www.theforce.net, a writer  
using the nickname BetterJedi wrote, ``Wow! What a film. I'm going 
to have to see it about 10 or 15 times to take it all in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But another writer, going by Job21, wasn't as impressed. ``It  
was a dream come true at first but quickly turned into a 
nightmare,'' Job21 said. 
</P>
<P>
	That was countered by a fuselage of reaction from fans, many of  
whom raised doubts about whether Job even saw the movie, pointing 
out his review noticeably lacked the kinds of details that would 
suggest he was there. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the theater operators themselves, they gave their usual  
tempered thumbs-up -- they praised the movie just enough to avoid 
losing any customers but not so much that Lucas could extract 
higher fees for showing the film. 
</P>
<P>
	The bottom line, financially, is the early buzz -- or for that  
matter the reactions from the professional critics who see 
``Phantom'' Friday night -- won't mean a thing initially, said Paul 
Dergarabedian, of box office tracker Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``This movie is critic-proof,'' he said. ``I think it doesn't  
matter what anybody says, good, bad or indifferent. The film is 
going to play big in those first two weeks without question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After that ... the Force only knows.

<HEADLINE> Bank of England Holds Interest Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The Bank of England kept its base lending rate at  
5.25 percent Thursday, halting a seven-month trend of reductions 
due to concerns that another cut might stoke inflationary 
pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank's Monetary Policy Committee voted to maintain  
its curent base rate for loans to banks. The rate is the lowest in 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the European Central Bank left its key interest rate  
unchanged at 2.5 percent at its regular meeting Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank cut the rate by half a percentage point a month ago,  
the first reduction since it took over monetary policy for the 11 
European Union nations that adopted the euro currency on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain has not adopted the euro.  
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of England policymaking panel based its decision on  
data showing signs of renewed growth and forecasts that inflation 
will remain in line with the targeted level of 2.5 percent, the 
bank said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank made ``the right decision,'' said Neil Parker, an  
economist with The Royal Bank of Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
	Parker expressed concern about the central bank's suggestion  
that it might lower rates in the future if the British pound does 
not weaken against other currencies. A strong pound makes British 
exports more expensive than goods from other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Bank of England's decision drew criticism from a  
major industrial union, the Manufacturing, Science and Finance 
union. 
</P>
<P>
	The MSF said the bank's committee members made ``a fatal error''  
by raising interest rates a year ago -- a decision that many blame 
for retarding economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their action this time around, by failing to lower rates, may  
turn out to be as serious an error,'' the union's general secretary 
Roger Lyons said. 
</P>
<P>
	``MSF will count every job lost during the summer, and we will  
not allow the bank to forget this disastrous mistake,'' Lyons said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank last changed the base lending rate on April 8, reducing  
it by a quarter of a percentage point to 5.25 percent.

<HEADLINE> Cable &AMP; Wireless Offer Hostile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- International Digital Communications Inc. is  
apparently sticking for the time being with a buyout bid by a 
Japanese company instead of accepting a more lucrative offer by 
Cable &AMP; Wireless. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for IDC, one of Japan's largest international phone  
companies, said the company had not decided on an official response 
to the offer by London-based Cable &AMP; Wireless, announced Thursday 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
	But Japanese media reports said IDC executives view Cable &AMP;  
Wireless' unsolicited takeover bid as hostile, raising the 
possibility they may try to resist. 
</P>
<P>
	IDC said in a statement that its board has already decided to  
recommend to shareholders that they sell the company to Nippon 
Telegraph &AMP; Telephone Corp. But it said the board would meet again 
to discuss the new offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable &AMP; Wireless' cash offer is worth $460 million, or $895 a  
share, and is aimed at topping NTT's bid of $880 in stock per 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released Thursday night, Cable &AMP; Wireless  
executive director Stephen Pettit said his company was offering IDC 
``a competitive future as part of a worldwide communications 
group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a hostile bid. They believe the new offer has lots of  
benefits compared to the NTT offer,'' Sachiko Hasegawa, a 
spokeswoman for public relations firm Gavin Anderson and Co., which 
represents Cable &AMP; Wireless in Japan, said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable &AMP; Wireless is already one of IDC's biggest shareholders  
with 17.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	While the British telecommunications giant said it ultimately  
wants complete ownership, its initial goal is to double its stake 
to 33.4 percent -- enough to give it a veto over board decisions and 
effective control of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	IDC is privately held by about 120 Japanese companies, and it is  
unclear how they will react to the offer. Unsolicited takeovers are 
rare in Japan, and previous attempts by foreigners have met with 
failure. 
</P>
<P>
	Attention is focused on the reaction of Toyota Motor Corp., one  
of IDC's three largest shareholders along with Cable &AMP; Wireless and 
Itochu Corp., a trading company. 
</P>
<P>
	With 17.7 percent of IDC's shares, Toyota's holdings would be  
enough to give Cable &AMP; Wireless the controlling stake it seeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota has reportedly said it would sell its holdings to the  
highest bidder. But accepting the bid by Cable &AMP; Wireless would 
risk drawing the ire of NTT, one of corporate Japan's most 
influential players. 
</P>
<P>
	The reaction of Toyota and other companies is being seen here as  
a test of just how much corporate Japan has changed. 
</P>
<P>
	Much ado has been made recently about steps to end the collusive  
ways companies here have done business and place more emphasis on 
the bottom line and shareholder return. 
</P>
<P>
	But old habits die hard, and criticism remains that Japan Inc.  
is as impenetrable as ever to outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, when Texas corporate raider T. Boone Pickens became the  
largest shareholder of Japanese auto parts maker Koito 
Manufacturing Co., Toyota, Koito's largest shareholder and 
customer, blocked his efforts to gain even a seat on the board 
until he eventually gave up and sold his stake.

<HEADLINE> Bulls Fall From First To Worst </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Bulls should have known on the very  
first day of practice they were in for a rough year. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't just that Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Dennis  
Rodman were gone. Or that there were so many new people milling 
about the practice facility it looked like a Welcome Wagon 
get-together. 
</P>
<P>
	Nope, the omen came when rookie coach Tim Floyd met his players  
-- and told them to go home because they didn't have enough players 
signed to practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know this much, there were a lot of different situations we  
had to deal with,'' Floyd said. ``All I know is that next year is 
going to look like Palm Beach with three days in between games, 
time to prepare. I'm saying that now and you'll probably remind me 
of that in April of next season, but there are a lot of things 
about next year that I'm looking forward to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like winning a few more games, maybe. The Bulls went 13-37 in  
this lockout-shortened season, the worst record in the Eastern 
Conference and third worst in the NBA. They finished 20 games 
behind Indiana -- the same Pacers team that Chicago beat last year 
in the Eastern finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Their .260 winning percentage was the lowest in franchise  
history, beating out the 1975-76 squad, which finished 24-58 with a 
.293 winning percentage. That team was 15-35 after 50 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Their average of 81.9 points was the lowest scoring average in  
NBA history since the inception of the shot clock. Entering this 
season, the lowest average was 87.4 points in 72 games by the 
Milwaukee Hawks in 1954-55, the season the clock was adopted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew it was going to be tough, I knew we were going to lose  
some games,'' Dickey Simpkins said Thursday after cleaning out his 
locker. ``I didn't know we were going to lose some games by as many 
points as we did. I didn't know we were going to set some records 
like we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That the Bulls were going to be bad this season was a given.  
When Jordan retired in January, management decided it was best to 
gut the team and start over rather than throw a bunch of money at 
Pippen, Rodman, Luc Longley and Steve Kerr for one last go-around. 
</P>
<P>
	That left the Bulls with Toni Kukoc, Ron Harper, a few backups  
and a bunch of anonymous players they picked up in the 
sign-and-trade deals for Pippen, Longley and Kerr. They barely knew 
each other's names, let alone the triangle offense, when the season 
began. With 50 games packed into a three-month span, there was time 
to play and travel and that was about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Forget rest, forget practice, forget anything but marginal  
improvement. And it showed in the box scores. Chicago won its 
second game -- OK, so it was against the Clippers, one of the few 
teams lowlier than the Bulls -- and then lost the next seven. 
</P>
<P>
	There were blowouts, awful, one-sided games throughout the  
season that are better off forgotten. There was a 49-point game 
against Miami, the lowest output since the shot clock, and a 
47-point loss to Orlando in early April, the most lopsided defeated 
in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a hard year,'' said Bill Wennington, one of the few  
veterans left. ``We really didn't have a lot of practice time, 
which made it difficult for us to get in an offensive flow and 
learn this offense because this is an offense of recognition. The 
only way you can get better at it is to run it and go over it in 
practice. We just didn't have that time this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls will get more time next year, but the road won't be  
much easier. Kukoc and Brent Barry are among just a handful of 
players under contract, and most of the free agents who could make 
a difference have already re-signed with their current teams. There 
are some good prospects in the draft, but not a Tim Duncan-like 
player who can come in and make a difference right away. 
</P>
<P>
	Give it time, Floyd said.  
</P>
<P>
	``This was a first step in what I hope will be a championship  
process,'' he said. ``If I didn't feel like that's what I wanted to 
accomplish personally when I came, then I wouldn't have come 
here.''

<HEADLINE> McCaffrey Urges Anti-Drug Prayers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Religious leaders are being asked to speak out  
against drug use, White House drug policy director Barry McCaffrey 
announced at Thursday's annual observance of the National Day of 
Prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey said the White House, as part of its drug control  
strategy, has been reaching out to religious groups of all 
denominations to get them involved. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest government report, in December, found that teen use  
has stabilized after years on the rise, although it is still more 
widespread than in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	But McCaffrey said discouraging drug use by young people is one  
of the best investments in the country's future. He said religion 
plays an important role in building the social values teens need to 
resist the lure of illegal substances. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never before in our nation's history has it been more  
important to pray for our young people,'' McCaffrey said at the 
ceremony in the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Day of Prayer is an annual observance, established  
by an act of Congress in 1952. It is held on the first Thursday in 
May.

<HEADLINE> France Privatizing Defense Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- The French Finance Ministry said today it would  
launch the privatization of aerospace group Aerospatiale Matra 
starting tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came after shareholders of Aerospatiale and  
Lagardere, the parent company of Matra, voted earlier in the day to 
approve an Aerospatiale-Matra merger. 
</P>
<P>
	The privatization process, which will start with the offering of  
shares to institutional investors, will lead to the sale of 17 
percent of the new company on the stock market, the ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Matra, through its subsidiaries, is a leading manufacturer of  
tactical missiles. Aerospatiale, which owns 37.9 percent of the 
European aviation consortium Airbus Industrie, also has strong 
missiles activities. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for transferring Matra to Aerospatiale, Lagardere  
will gain a 33 percent stake in the combined company. 
</P>
<P>
	The French government has said it will remain the largest  
shareholder in the merged group. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger and privatization may accelerate the pace of  
restructuring in the European defense sector, analysts have said. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's DaimlerChrysler Aerospace and France's Thomson-CSF are  
seen as the next likely movers following British Aerospace's 
takeover of General Electric PLC's Marconi division earlier this 
year.

	COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) -- As Alice Forman prepared to graduate  
from college with a chemical engineering degree, she began looking 
for guidance that didn't come from a textbook. 
</P>
<P>
	She attended Bible study to find out what her atheist parents  
had steered her away from, and what her relatives had urged her to 
embrace. At age 23, Ms. Forman was baptized recently as an 
Episcopalian. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just at a turning point in my life and I felt sort of  
lost, like I was approaching adulthood and I didn't really know 
what I was doing with my life,'' said Ms. Forman, a senior at the 
University of Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	She is among thousands of college students who are turning to  
religion to find meaning in their lives. Both secular and 
church-affiliated colleges report surging use of campus religious 
centers and increasing attendance at many religious activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes your college experience complete. You have your  
studies, you have your time to go out with your friends and you 
have God,'' said Jennifer Rogers, 19, a lifelong Episcopalian who 
studies French and secondary education at the University of 
Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest among students in the offerings of churches, mosques,  
synagogues and temples may reflect the increasing complexity of 
society and the special challenges of modern students' lives. Many 
students have borrowed thousands of dollars to meet college costs. 
Others find themselves confronting for the first time a variety of 
pressures, from broken families to acknowledging their 
homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kind of student I see now ... is a student that comes with  
very heavy burdens,'' said Sharon Kugler, chaplain at Johns Hopkins 
University and vice president of the National Association of 
College and University Chaplains. ``I hope that what we see now is 
a precursor to getting back to living lives that are healthy and 
are gentle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kugler said when she arrived at the fiercely secular Johns  
Hopkins in 1993, eight religious groups were active on campus. Now 
there are 20, representing Buddhism, Hinduism, the Bahai faith, 
Unitarianism and seven Christian denominations. Later this year, 
for the first time in its 123-year history, Johns Hopkins will open 
an interfaith center, using a former Methodist church. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike students of the anti-establishment 1960s and '70s and  
those pursuing more materialistic goals in the '80s, college 
students today are asking deeply personal questions about their 
place in the world, said Richard M. Joel, president of Washington, 
D.C.-based Hillel, the Foundation For Jewish Campus Life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's a recognition that people are on a trip that  
is not easy, and the question is, `How do I make it valuable? How 
do I matter?''' said Joel, whose group maintains 107 Hillel centers 
on campuses across the United States and also in Canada, Israel and 
Russia. ``I think they are looking for personal enrichment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The spiritual interest of some students rubs off on others, said  
Phil Evans, spokesman for the InterVarsity Christian Fellowship-USA 
headquartered in Madison, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Students do trust their peers. When they come into a community  
of students seeking truth ... they're attracted,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	InterVarsity has enjoyed a steady increase in numbers in the  
past 10 years, from 23,000 in 1989 to 30,000 now, according to 
Evans. The 60-year-old ecumenical Christian group has 700 chapters 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Students are hungry for religion because many of them were  
raised without it, said Vincent Krische, a chaplain and director of 
Catholic Campus Ministry at the University of Kansas at Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there has been a failure in passing on meaning and  
value,'' he said. ``When we fail to pass them on, something 
internally inspires people to search for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This resurgence in religious interest is welcome news to people  
like Donald Shockley, who heads campus ministry programs for the 
United Methodist Church in Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	``It fills me with optimism because I think that the quality of  
leadership going into the life of the churches is going to be 
affected by this positively. When you have people of student age 
interested in what the church is doing ... many of them will go 
into the church right away both as clergy and young people,'' he 
said. ``And that will have an impact on the life of the church. ''

<HEADLINE>  Ex-Dallas Cowboy Mark Tuinei Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Mark Tuinei was headed home to Hawaii,  
hoping to teach youngsters the same skills that helped him become a 
three-time Super Bowl champion with the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
	A meeting with Kale Ane, the football coach at Punahou School in  
Honolulu, was scheduled for today. Ane was going to offer Tuinei a 
job as an assistant coach and Tuinei told friends he was going to 
take it. 
</P>
<P>
	But early Thursday, tragedy struck. A friend found Tuinei  
unconscious in a car at his home and immediately called for help. 
By the time paramedics arrived, it was too late. The 39-year-old 
Tuinei was dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Collin County medical examiner said the cause of death won't  
be known until Monday or Tuesday at the earliest, once an autopsy 
and toxicology tests are finalized. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no word about memorial or funeral services.  
</P>
<P>
	Friends and former teammates remembered ``Tui'' (TWO-ee) as a  
fun-loving man who cared deeply about others. They also admired his 
toughness and how he overcame adversity to become a two-time Pro 
Bowler. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was such a great friend, a great teammate and a wonderful  
person,'' quarterback Troy Aikman said. ``He was one of the 
most-liked guys who has ever played in a Cowboys uniform. He was 
one of those guys everybody loved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Growing up in the town of Nanakuli, the 6-foot-5, 320-pound  
Tuinei threw his fists more often than blocks. He tried for a fresh 
start by going to UCLA, but two years and several fights later he 
transferred to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	Suspended one year and injured the next, Tuinei wasn't drafted  
by the NFL. The best he could get was an invitation to Cowboys 
training camp in 1983, along with 84 other hopefuls. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuinei, who played defensive line in those days, defied the odds  
and made the team, even seeing action in 10 games. Coaches later 
decided his future was on offense, and by 1987 he became a starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuinei eventually settled in at left tackle, the most vital spot  
on the line because it protects the quarterback's blind side. 
Beginning in 1989, that quarterback was Aikman. A year later, 
Tuinei's duties included opening holes for running back Emmitt 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	With Tuinei anchoring the line in front of Aikman and Smith, the  
Cowboys won Super Bowls in 1993, '94 and '96. Tuinei missed only 
nine games from 1989-96. 
</P>
<P>
	Injuries eventually caught up to Tuinei, slowing him in 1997 and  
causing the team to release him in April 1998. He wanted to come 
back one more year to set the team record for longevity, but his 
body wouldn't allow it. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuinei appeared ready to turn his life in a new direction by  
going home. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was hoping to return to go back to school at the  
(University of Hawaii) and it looked like a good mix,'' said Ane, 
who in past years worked several clinics in Hawaii with Tuinei. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Bates, Tuinei's teammate all 15 years in Dallas, marking  
the second-longest tandem in NFL history, said Tuinei would've been 
a great coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had great pride with me in saying he was a coach, too,  
now,'' said Bates, who became a Cowboys assistant last season. ``I 
think he's definitely going to be up in heaven coaching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bates was one of several former teammates who said Tuinei was  
like a brother to them. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was one guy who lived life to the fullest,'' Bates said.  
``I've never met a person who spoke negatively of Mark Tuinei. 
We're all going to miss him so, so very much.' 
</P>
<P>
	Daryl Johnston said he saw Tuinei smiling again on television  
Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the way we want to remember Mark,'' he said. ``That's  
how he'll always be to me -- a teammate, a friend ... someone who 
helped me through times when I needed somebody to look to, someone 
who showed me the right way to do things and what it took to be 
successful in life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rich Miano, who played at Hawaii with Tuinei before an NFL  
career with the New York Jets, Philadelphia Eagles and Atlanta 
Falcons, said Tuinei had begun teaching others those same lessons. 
</P>
<P>
	``He really cared about young people,'' said Miano, who ran a  
week-long clinic with Tuinei in American Samoa. ``He just wanted to 
give back.''

<HEADLINE> School Violence Solutions Debated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Schools must fight violence on many fronts --  
from increasing counseling for troubled students to keeping weapons 
out of schools with metal detectors -- educators and safety experts 
told a Senate panel Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know we can't find The Answer,'' said Sen. Mike DeWine,  
R-Ohio. ``We can certainly find answers, things we can do to make a 
difference, child by child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After last month's fatal shootings in Littleton, Colo.,  
policymakers and school leaders are left asking what's the better 
investment: violence prevention or tighter security? 
</P>
<P>
	Some argued Thursday for the latter during a hearing before the  
Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to deal with the security of the immediate  
environment,'' said Kenneth Trump, president of National School 
Safety and Security Services of Cleveland, Ohio. ``A school's 9 
a.m. violence prevention program and 11 a.m. conflict-resolution 
class will have little impact if there is an 8 a.m. multiple 
shooting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trump said many school officials don't want their schools to get  
a reputation for being unsafe, so they are reluctant to install 
metal detectors or take other precautions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many schools avoid even the most basic security risk reduction  
methods,'' he said, including posting staff at every entrance to 
greet strangers who enter. 
</P>
<P>
	Others testified that the Littleton incident, with its death  
toll of 15, gives a false impression of school violence. It is 
actually on the decline, said William Strauss, a Virginia author of 
books on the so-called Millennium Generation, children born after 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
	School deaths peaked in the 1992-93 school year with 55, he  
said. In contrast, the total for the current school year, including 
the Columbine killings, is 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Strauss and others suggested increased federal funding for  
programs that identify loners, outcasts and other troubled kids and 
encourage them to participate in school and community events. 
</P>
<P>
	``Security gates, surveillance cameras and other technology  
fixes can make schools safer,'' Strauss said, ``but they aren't 
nearly as important as harnessing the constructive energy of the 
students themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congress is debating the renewal of the nation's major education  
law. President Clinton requested authorization for spending $591 
million for safe and drug-free school programs next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, Sens. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., and Edward Kennedy,  
D-Mass., introduced a plan to give schools flexibility in using 
federal funds for substance abuse and mental health services.

<HEADLINE> Cops Escape Shooting Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) -- Four police officers were justified  
when they fired 23 bullets at a young black woman they found 
sitting armed and unresponsive in a disabled car, the district 
attorney said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Grover Trask said the officers may have acted  
hastily and made mistakes in judgment, but they did not act 
criminally when they killed Tyisha Miller, 19, in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Miller's death led to allegations that the officers -- three  
whites and a Hispanic -- were racists. Religious leaders, civil 
rights activists and residents of Riverside, 60 miles east of Los 
Angeles, protested the shooting at town hall meetings, vigils and 
marches. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought we were going to get justice but we just got the  
same old thing,'' said the Rev. Bernell Butler, Ms. Miller's 
cousin. ``Police officers are able to murder and get away with 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Miller had pulled into a gas station parking lot with a flat  
tire. Relatives who arrived to help her said they called police 
after Ms. Miller appeared to be having a seizure and was foaming at 
the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	Trask said the officers found Ms. Miller unresponsive, lying on  
the fully reclined driver's seat with a gun in her lap. They were 
unable to awaken her by banging on the windows, shining lights or 
shaking the car, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	When an officer tried to break the driver's side window with a  
baton and reach for the gun, Ms. Miller sat up, lifted a pager and 
stared at the cop, who backed away, Trask said. 
</P>
<P>
	One officer yelled at the others to hold their fire, and the  
woman lay down again, Trask said. When she rose up again and 
appeared to reach for the gun, the officers all fired, the 
prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
	A coroner's report indicated all the bullets entered her body  
from the back, proving that she was not laying down when she was 
shot, Trask said. Ms. Miller was hit by 12 of the 23 bullets. Four 
struck her in the head. 
</P>
<P>
	Toxicology tests showed Ms. Miller had a blood-alcohol level of  
.13 percent. A driver in California is legally intoxicated at .08 
percent. Tests also detected marijuana residue. 
</P>
<P>
	Trask said the officers' plan to break in the window of Ms.  
Miller's locked car to get the gun out of her lap may have been a 
mistake, but it did not reach the level of criminal conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``In deciding whether or not to file criminal charges, the job  
was not to determine what the police could have done or even what 
they should have done,'' Trask said.

<HEADLINE> Clippers Hope Move Prompts Wins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Clippers have played their  
final game in the 40-year-old Sports Arena and will move to a 
spiffy new home just up the street. Whether they can leave their 
losing tradition behind is another question. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers, long the dependable doormat of the NBA, actually  
seem to have some upside potential for a change. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers have a nucleus of promising young players who will  
be on the court next season at the Staples Center being built 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	``We learned a lot; we could be in the playoffs next season,''  
said rookie Tyrone Nesby, who came out of nowhere to win a starting 
job at forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Said second-year forward Maurice Taylor, who became the  
Clippers' best player: ``We became a better team down the stretch, 
played better team ball. We have things to build on. The future's 
looking good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor obviously has high hopes for his young teammates,  
especially Nesby and Troy Hudson, a late arrival who, like Nesby, 
came from the Continental Basketball Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``Troy Hudson will be the best point guard in the league,''  
Taylor said. ``You can quote me on that. It makes me feel better 
knowing Hudson will be here. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tyrone Nesby will be one of the most exciting players in the  
league next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Taylor had a solid season, he has set his personal -- as  
well as team -- goals high. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played well and became a lot better,'' he said. ``But I want  
to be an All-Star. I want to do a lot of things. On a scale of 1 to 
10, this season was about a 6 for what I feel I can do in this 
league. I'm not going to stop here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, Nesby, Hudson and Michael Olowokandi, the first player  
picked in the draft in 1998, all made progress this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor averaged 16.8 points, Nesby 10.1, and Hudson, who signed  
a 10-day contract in March and played his way into the lineup, 
averaged 6.8 in 25 games, six as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Olowokandi, a native of Nigeria who grew up in London and played  
very little organized basketball until going to the University of 
Pacific, averaged 8.9 points and 7.9 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I learned the NBA game in general,'' he said after the  
Clippers' final game of the season, a 107-105 loss to Seattle on 
Wednesday. ``Hopefully, I can take these things into next season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First-year coach Chris Ford, hired just shortly before the  
abbreviated season began, was generally pleased with the way the 
team eventually played. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a short but hectic season. I think our guys played hard  
after that abysmal start,'' Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
	When the league's labor dispute was finally settled and the  
50-game season began, the Clippers looked as if they might never 
win one. They lost their first 17 games, tying an NBA record, but 
began to win occasionally afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	They finished 9-41, second worst in the league only to  
Vancouver's 8-42. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be an important summer. We need to keep the  
players we want, and to get a couple of veteran free agents,'' Ford 
said. ``We need a couple of veterans on the bench so they can tell 
these young players stories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eight Clippers are eligible to become free agents, with Nesby,  
forwards Rodney Rogers and Lamond Murray, and forward-center 
Lorenzen Wright among them. 
</P>
<P>
	The players are happy they're moving to a new arena.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to help a lot, as far as attracting free agents and  
making basketball fun and exciting,'' Taylor said. ``It's going to 
be an enormous arena and state-of-the-art, so it's going to make 
coming to the gym that much more fun.''

<HEADLINE> Post-Jordan Playoffs Set To Begin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Nine out of 10 people probably think that Michael Jordan made  
the last shot of last year's NBA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's probably right, yeah,'' said John Stockton, who  
remembers better than most what everyone else has forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Stockton, not Jordan, who took the last shot last June.  
And unlike Jordan's famous final attempt, Stockton's didn't go in. 
</P>
<P>
	``That wouldn't have won the series, but it would have given us  
another chance to win the championship -- which is a lot better than 
the way it turned out,'' Stockton said. ``I liked our chances in 
the next game, but that's easy to say now. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's over with, and it won't do much good to dwell on it. I  
had an opportunity to make the shot and it didn't quite go. But I'd 
take it again if it happened again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stockton and his running mate, Karl Malone, are a long way from  
having it happen again. It'll take 11 wins before they can reach 
the finals again to have another chance to capture the title that 
has eluded them throughout their otherwise stellar careers. 
</P>
<P>
	Another year older, with Stockton, Malone and Jeff Hornacek on  
the last years of their contracts and no longer the No. 1 seeded 
team in the West, the Jazz will have to work their way through a 
postseason that looks an awful lot different than it did last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The absence of Jordan, of course, is the biggest change of all.  
</P>
<P>
	But scattered throughout both conferences are a number of  
younger, quicker teams who believe their chances are as good as 
anyone's in this first year of the post-Jordan era. One of those 
teams is Utah's first-round opponent, the Sacramento Kings -- the 
highest scoring team in the NBA this season and one of the most fun 
to watch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a lot of respect for that team and what they're  
doing out there,'' coach Jerry Sloan said. ``They're trying to 
build a winner, and that's something we can understand in our 
organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings and Jazz open their best-of-5 first-round series on  
Saturday -- one of four series that begin that day. The Heat and 
Knicks renew their rivalry in the day's first game, and the other 
matchups are Phoenix-Portland and Detroit-Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The other four series -- Philadelphia-Orlando, Minnesota-San  
Antonio, Houston-L.A. Lakers and Milwaukee-Indiana -- begin Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	All around the league, players and coaches are eagerly awaiting  
a chance to head into the postseason knowing that Jordan and the 
Bulls no longer stand in the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll miss it,'' said Scottie Pippen, who moved on to the  
Rockets in the breakup of the Bulls that commenced when the lockout 
ended in January. ``It certainly feels different this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``it'' team right now is the San Antonio Spurs, whose  
reputation for softness melted away this season as the team brought 
in playoff-tested veterans Kerr, Jerome Kersey and Mario Elie. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team is farther along than any team I've ever been on,''  
said David Robinson, a 10-year veteran. ``So I'm excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio ended the season with victories in 31 of its final  
36 games to win the No. 1 seed in the West and homecourt advantage 
throughout the postseason. With Tim Duncan a year older and now the 
No. 1 option on offense, there are few teams that can stop San 
Antonio's front line. 
</P>
<P>
	The Miami Heat are the team sitting atop the East, and their  
first order of business will be to keep their tempers in check and 
maintain their overachieving ways as they play their fiercest 
rivals, the Knicks, in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be the third straight year that the Heat and Knicks  
have played in the postseason, and the last two series were 
dramatically altered by late-game fights. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both teams have been burned enough in the postseason -- two  
years ago New York, and last year us -- so maybe this might be the 
real deal,'' Heat coach Pat Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only six victories separated the No. 1 team in the East from the  
eighth team, so there is little difference between the top and 
bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Iverson's Philadelphia 76ers, for example, manhandled the  
third-seeded Orlando Magic in two of their three games during the 
regular season and literally threw away a victory in the third 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson enters the postseason as the league's leading scorer  
looking to prove that he can be a playoff performer to be reckoned 
with. 
</P>
<P>
	The East features other various sideshows, the weirdest of which  
is where to play Games 4 and 5 of the Atlanta-Detroit series. The 
Palace of Auburn Hills is booked for a concert next Friday when the 
Pistons are scheduled to host Game 4, and the Georgia Dome is 
booked for a concert the following Monday -- the night of Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
	The games might be moved to the Silverdome and Georgia Tech's  
Alexander Memorial Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers, of course, have been a sideshow all year -- signing  
and releasing Dennis Rodman, firing Del Harris, trading Elden 
Campbell and Eddie Jones for Glen Rice, watching Kobe Bryant 
freelance to the detriment of O'Neal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It depends which Lakers team shows up. If they have their  
heads on straight, we'll have the toughest series of anybody,'' 
Houston's Charles Barkley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Portland Trail Blazers, after contending for the best  
leaguewide record until the final few days, must cope with their 
first bout of on-the-court adversity this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Making matters worse, Isaiah Rider has regularly been showing up  
tardy lately -- just the latest of Rider's many behavioral episodes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our biggest opponent right now is ourselves,'' backup point  
guard Greg Anthony said. ``The commitment is not there. We've got 
too many agendas right now. If we don't address them before the 
playoffs, we're going to have a very short run.''

<HEADLINE>  Ex-Dallas Cowboy Mark Tuinei Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Mark Tuinei was headed home to Hawaii,  
hoping to teach youngsters the same skills that helped him become a 
three-time Super Bowl champion with the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
	A meeting with Kale Ane, the football coach at Punahou School in  
Honolulu, was scheduled for today. Ane was going to offer Tuinei a 
job as an assistant coach and Tuinei told friends he was going to 
take it. 
</P>
<P>
	But early Thursday, tragedy struck. A friend found Tuinei  
unconscious in a car at his home and immediately called for help. 
By the time paramedics arrived, it was too late. The 39-year-old 
Tuinei was dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Collin County medical examiner said the cause of death won't  
be known until Monday or Tuesday at the earliest, once an autopsy 
and toxicology tests are finalized. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no word about memorial or funeral services.  
</P>
<P>
	Friends and former teammates remembered ``Tui'' (TWO-ee) as a  
fun-loving man who cared deeply about others. They also admired his 
toughness and how he overcame adversity to become a two-time Pro 
Bowler. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was such a great friend, a great teammate and a wonderful  
person,'' quarterback Troy Aikman said. ``He was one of the 
most-liked guys who has ever played in a Cowboys uniform. He was 
one of those guys everybody loved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Growing up in the town of Nanakuli, the 6-foot-5, 320-pound  
Tuinei threw his fists more often than blocks. He tried for a fresh 
start by going to UCLA, but two years and several fights later he 
transferred to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	Suspended one year and injured the next, Tuinei wasn't drafted  
by the NFL. The best he could get was an invitation to Cowboys 
training camp in 1983, along with 84 other hopefuls. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuinei, who played defensive line in those days, defied the odds  
and made the team, even seeing action in 10 games. Coaches later 
decided his future was on offense, and by 1987 he became a starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuinei eventually settled in at left tackle, the most vital spot  
on the line because it protects the quarterback's blind side. 
Beginning in 1989, that quarterback was Aikman. A year later, 
Tuinei's duties included opening holes for running back Emmitt 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	With Tuinei anchoring the line in front of Aikman and Smith, the  
Cowboys won Super Bowls in 1993, '94 and '96. Tuinei missed only 
nine games from 1989-96. 
</P>
<P>
	Injuries eventually caught up to Tuinei, slowing him in 1997 and  
causing the team to release him in April 1998. He wanted to come 
back one more year to set the team record for longevity, but his 
body wouldn't allow it. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuinei appeared ready to turn his life in a new direction by  
going home. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was hoping to return to go back to school at the  
(University of Hawaii) and it looked like a good mix,'' said Ane, 
who in past years worked several clinics in Hawaii with Tuinei. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Bates, Tuinei's teammate all 15 years in Dallas, marking  
the second-longest tandem in NFL history, said Tuinei would've been 
a great coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had great pride with me in saying he was a coach, too,  
now,'' said Bates, who became a Cowboys assistant last season. ``I 
think he's definitely going to be up in heaven coaching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bates was one of several former teammates who said Tuinei was  
like a brother to them. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was one guy who lived life to the fullest,'' Bates said.  
``I've never met a person who spoke negatively of Mark Tuinei. 
We're all going to miss him so, so very much.' 
</P>
<P>
	Daryl Johnston said he saw Tuinei smiling again on television  
Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the way we want to remember Mark,'' he said. ``That's  
how he'll always be to me -- a teammate, a friend ... someone who 
helped me through times when I needed somebody to look to, someone 
who showed me the right way to do things and what it took to be 
successful in life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rich Miano, who played at Hawaii with Tuinei before an NFL  
career with the New York Jets, Philadelphia Eagles and Atlanta 
Falcons, said Tuinei had begun teaching others those same lessons. 
</P>
<P>
	``He really cared about young people,'' said Miano, who ran a  
week-long clinic with Tuinei in American Samoa. ``He just wanted to 
give back.''

<HEADLINE> Fatal Racing Accident Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- A short piece of videotape showed  
investigators how a fatal accident ended at Lowe's Motor Speedway. 
Now they're hoping technology can help them determine how it 
started. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators plan to use a crane to aid them in their attempts  
to re-enact the flight of a wheel that broke off a car and went 
into the stands, killing three spectators and injuring eight. 
</P>
<P>
	A crane will be one of several tools used in the coming days by  
investigators for K&AMP;K Insurance, the speedway's insurer, to try to 
find out how the wreck occurred in Saturday night's Indy Racing 
League event. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want to make sure you've got it right,'' Doug Hamm, senior  
vice president of Fort Wayne, Ind.-based K&AMP;K, said Thursday. 
``They'll confer with all the experts. It could be a week or two 
before we know anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators decided to bring a crane to the speedway because  
of a 10-second piece of videotape that shows the wheel descending 
into the stands, officials said. The videotape, shot by a spectator 
who refused to identify himself when he dropped it off at the track 
late Monday night, does not show the crash or the ascent of the 
wheel over the speedway's 15-foot catch fence. 
</P>
<P>
	But investigators believe the tape shows enough for them to try  
to re-enact the wheel's flight by using a crane and working 
backward from the top of the flight path, possibly telling them 
more about the source of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of times you find out that three or four things had to  
have happened for this all to take place,'' Hamm said. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash, which occurred at speeds near 215 mph, sent the wheel  
and suspension parts rocketing into the fourth-turn grandstands. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators believe the tape can help them estimate such  
things as the top height of the wheel and its angles of both ascent 
and descent. Based on those variables, investigators are hopeful of 
then matching information from the re-enactment with the IRL's 
timing and scoring tapes from the race, possibly helping them 
pinpoint the crash's origin. 
</P>
<P>
	Since investigators have no video of the start of the wreck,  
they are still uncertain whether the wheel flew directly into the 
stands or was catapulted over the fence by making contact with 
another car. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of people scratching their heads right now  
trying to think these things through,'' Hamm said. 
</P>
<P>
	The height of Charlotte's safety fence conforms with industry  
standards, but speedway engineers have drafted plans to both raise 
its height and extend the 35-inch-long canopy that extends from the 
top of the fence. 
</P>
<P>
	Learning more about the path of the wheel's upward flight from  
the racing surface could factor into the track's plans for altering 
the fence around the 1.5-mile, high-banked superspeedway. 
</P>
<P>
	The only one of the eight injured people still hospitalized,  
Haley McGee, 9, of Conover, N.C., remained in critical condition 
Thursday at Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte. McGee, who has 
swelling on her brain, also has developed pneumonia, her family 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The speedway reopened Wednesday for two days of what were  
supposed to be private tests for Winston Cup cars. But so many fans 
showed up Wednesday and Thursday and asked to come in that General 
Motors, which booked the test, finally allowed the speedway to open 
the gates. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans filtered in and out Thursday, relaxing in the frontstretch  
grandstand while the cars, many of them lacking paint jobs or 
numbers, turned lap after lap.

<HEADLINE> Court OKs Yellowstone Bison Slaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal appeals court refused Thursday to  
stop Montana from slaughtering bison outside Yellowstone National 
Park to prevent the animals from infecting cattle with a serious 
livestock disease. 
</P>
<P>
	In a one-sentence ruling, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  
upheld a federal judge's decision allowing the state and the 
National Park Service to continue killing bison as they have for 
the last three winters. 
</P>
<P>
	Bison leave Yellowstone in search of winter forage. About half  
test positive for brucellosis, a disease that can cause cows to 
abort and, in rare cases, can spread to humans and cause a 
recurring fever. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,200 bison that left Yellowstone have been shot or  
shipped to slaughter in the last three years, mostly in the winter 
of 1996-97. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmental groups that challenged the plan contended there  
was no evidence the disease could spread from Yellowstone bison to 
cattle grazing on neighboring land. They also contended the 
slaughter conflicts with the designated role of the park as a 
wildlife sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
	John Bloomquist, the state's lawyer, told the court in a hearing  
last month that the state's stringent measures for controlling 
brucellosis have protected the cattle industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyer Andrew Mergen said at the same hearing  
that brucellosis, target of a $1 billion government eradication 
program, has been eliminated virtually everywhere but among 
Yellowstone bison.

<HEADLINE> Black Businesses Target Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- On the day his son was born, Ron Anderson  
witnessed a second birth as well: an entrepreneurial spirit that 
drove him from a secure corporate job into the growing ranks of 
black business owners who see a future in the world of high 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine years later, Anderson, 38, is president of the Demand &AMP;  
Supply Fulfillment Center, a 150-member marketing cooperative whose 
members include small computer manufacturing, Internet services and 
DVD production companies, as well as more traditional businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea was formed by the birth of a child,'' Anderson said  
Thursday as he manned his company's booth at the California 
African-American Business Summit '99. ``My son was born and I 
started thinking about ways I could put some people to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although color barriers continue to frustrate minority  
entrepreneurs, Anderson and others attending the conference are 
convinced times have never been better for blacks to get into 
business. In doing so, blacks are targeting higher-profit 
industries such as information technology, observers say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like other people, we're looking at technology,  
telecommunications. We're looking at areas that are growing,'' said 
Patricia A. Means, publisher of Turning Point magazine, sponsor of 
the three-day summit which ends Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	As they do so, blacks also are finding it necessary to become  
more sophisticated about marketing, venture capital and partnering. 
The 400 or so people who attended the conference sat through 
sessions telling them how to spot emerging markets in the United 
States and abroad and how to influence the political process. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of black-owned firms in the United States grew 46  
percent to 620,912 between 1987 and 1992, nearly double the rate 
for all businesses, according to the most recent Census Bureau 
figures. Revenues for black-owned enterprises expanded 63 percent 
during the period, from $19.8 billion to $32.2 billion. That 
compares to a 67 percent increase, to $3.3 trillion, for all 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Small, marginally profitable service businesses, such as retail  
stores, beauty shops and employment agencies, accounted for 53 
percent of black-owned firms. But Means and others believe that 
number is dropping, in part because banks and big corporations have 
realized they can profit by doing business in black communities. 
That has opened doors for black entrepreneurs to make money as 
suppliers, consultants and partners to larger white-owned 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, investors in Nu Capital Access Group, a venture  
capital company that focuses on minority businesses in the San 
Francisco area, includes Bank of America, Wells Fargo and 
Washington Mutual Inc., said Nu Capital chairman Len Canty. Bank of 
America was the first to sign on. 
</P>
<P>
	``To start they were not too keen on the idea. Fortunately we  
had a brother there who drove the whole process,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once Nu Capital became successful, the Bank of America invested  
more money and the other banks got involved, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end of the day, the business has to make sense,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A lack of access to capital is one of the biggest barriers to  
minority business owners. On average, black businesses start out 
with less capital and are less likely to get bank loans than white 
entrepreneurs, according to a 1993 study by Timothy Bates, a 
professor of labor and urban affairs at Wayne State University in 
Detroit. The mean level of capital available to new black business 
owners was $12,224. That's 43 percent less than the $17,488 
available to whites, Bates found. 
</P>
<P>
	Racial prejudice also remains an obstacle for black  
entrepreneurs, but has become less of a problem in recent years, 
said Fred Calloway, president and chairman of BC2 Environmental 
Corp., a Fullerton-based drilling company that tests soil for 
contamination. He said 99 percent of his business is with 
white-owned companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very good time for African-Americans to go into  
business. I think we have a greater awareness of business and the 
larger society is more accepting of us,'' he said. ``I think the 
larger society is more accepting of us. We're showing them we are 
competent. Once they saw our capabilities, being black or white 
didn't make any difference.''

<HEADLINE> L.A. Urged To Replace DA in Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In a highly critical review, federal civil  
rights officials recommended replacing the Los Angeles County 
district attorney with a special prosecutor in abuse cases 
involving police and sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Civil Rights Commission issued the unprecedented  
recommendation Wednesday after a six-year review. The commissioners 
said that because police and the district attorney work closely in 
prosecutions, the DA's work in officer-involved cases can create 
the appearance of a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you separate those functions ... you can try to institute  
more fairness,'' said Mary Frances Berry, commission chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the eight board members dissented in the report,  
calling the recommendation an ``overreaction.'' Police officials 
also disagreed with the findings. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission's 233-page report pointed to the district  
attorney's track record in prosecuting accused police officers and 
sheriff's deputies. Criminal charges were filed against 11 deputies 
in 126 cases of alleged abuse in the Sheriff's Department in 1996 
and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The recommendations are not binding, but departments usually  
implement them, Ms. Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cmdr. Dave Kalish, a Los Angeles police spokesman, said his  
department has serious concerns about the report. ``The conclusions 
are simply not based on fact,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report included sweeping generalizations, outdated  
information and inaccurate findings, he said. Kalish criticized the 
heavy reliance on newspaper accounts and witnesses with ``an 
agenda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The department's use-of-force incidents have dropped, its  
diversity has increased and an ombudsman has been added to the 
staff to handle internal disputes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Sheriff's Department spokesman and a spokeswoman for the  
district attorney had not seen the report and declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Civil Rights Commission began its investigation into the  
LAPD and the Sheriff's Department in 1993, as part of a nationwide 
project on racial and ethnic tensions. 
</P>
<P>
	Race riots stemming from the beating of Rodney King erupted in  
Los Angeles in 1992. The findings and recommendations will be 
forwarded to the president and Congress, as well as local 
officials.

<HEADLINE> House Approves $13.1B for Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With Republicans saying President Clinton has  
``gutted the American military,'' the House overwhelmingly approved 
$13.1 billion Thursday for the fight with Yugoslavia and to 
buttress U.S. forces around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would more than double the $6.05 billion Clinton  
requested last month to wage the air war through September and care 
for hundreds of thousands of refugees who have fled Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The additions include $1.1 billion to buy missiles and bombs,  
$1.3 billion for spare parts, $1.8 billion to improve troops' pay 
and pensions, and $1.1 billion to modernize military bases, mostly 
in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Final passage was by 311-105, with sound majorities of both  
parties supporting the package. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate has not produced its own version of the legislation.  
GOP leaders there have said they prefer a package closer in size to 
Clinton's request, and a House-Senate compromise of about $9 
billion is expected to emerge next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Just eight days after the House refused to voice support for the  
U.S.-led NATO air campaign, many members of both parties were eager 
to demonstrate their support for U.S. troops by approving the 
funds. But many Republicans wanted to go further by pinning the 
need for extra money on Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without any coherent international blue print, the White House  
has bombed its way around the globe while dropping troops far and 
wide for ill-defined peacemaking duties,'' said House Majority Whip 
Tom DeLay, R-Texas. ``This policy has gutted the American military 
-- which now must be rebuilt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said the extra money was largely a GOP effort to  
relieve a spending crunch looming next year by shifting projects 
into this year's budget. And they accused Republicans of using the 
war to try to embarrass Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last week's amendment was clearly intended to simply pin the  
label on the war of being Clinton's war, unfortunately politicizing 
the situation,'' said Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, ranking 
Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	A Democratic attempt to pare back the measure was rejected,  
260-164. The proposal would have left the measure at $11.6 billion 
-- including Clinton requests for $962 million for Central American 
victims of Hurricane Mitch and $374 million for U.S. farmers, 
proposals that have languished in Congress for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement underlining the difficulty of opposing defense  
spending while American troops are in combat, the White House 
budget office did not threaten a presidential veto of the House 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	It did, however, urge lawmakers ``to avoid confrontation'' by  
cutting the bill and adding aid for U.S. farmers and Central 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	The House effort came amid the sixth week of the air campaign as  
diplomatic progress was reported in the effort to ease the Kosovo 
crisis. Russia has embraced NATO demands that Serb troops be 
removed and that an armed international force be allowed to keep 
the peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Highlighting legislators' desires to be seen as supporting the  
troops, the House voted 301-117 to reject an amendment by 
conservative Rep. Ernest Istook, R-Okla., that would have blocked 
use of any of the bill's funds for a ground war without Congress' 
consent. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight days ago, the House voted 249-180 for nearly identical  
language requiring congressional approval for a ground campaign. 
But that was a symbolic measure because lawmakers knew Clinton 
would veto it. With Democrats warning of a veto of the entire 
spending bill if Istook's language was attached, his proposal was 
defeated. 
</P>
<P>
	Tempers flared during the House debate. Without mentioning  
names, Rep. Henry Bonilla, R-Texas, criticized ``members of this 
body who don't care about our military and the future of the safety 
and security of this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That prompted an angry Obey to call the remarks ``meaningless,  
nasty rhetoric that discredits this entire institution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a voice vote, lawmakers approved language by Rep. Tom Latham,  
R-Iowa, adding nearly $110 million in assistance to American 
farmers hurt by low commodity prices. A provision by Rep. Nancy 
Pelosi, D-Calif., adding $67 million in refugee aid was also added 
by voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
	An effort by conservatives to pay for the measure with spending  
cuts in many domestic programs failed, 322-101. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the bill will be paid for from this year's expected $111  
billion federal surplus. That is a sensitive point for many 
lawmakers, especially Republicans, because this year's surplus will 
come entirely from Social Security, whose surpluses GOP leaders 
have repeatedly pledged not to touch. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill includes $453 million for ongoing U.S. military  
operations against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> UAW Protests Teamsters Honda Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- The United Auto Workers, which failed to  
unionize Honda autoworkers in the 1980s, is protesting a Teamsters 
effort to organize the automaker's Ohio plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW says in a complaint sent to the AFL-CIO that it alone  
should be allowed to try to organize the autoworkers. Both the 
Teamsters and the UAW are members of the labor federation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The International Union, UAW hereby requests exclusivity in  
seeking to organize production and maintenance employees of Honda 
of America at its facilities in Marysville, Ohio,'' said a letter 
signed by UAW President Stephen P. Yokich. 
</P>
<P>
	The Teamsters made the complaint public late Wednesday. UAW  
spokesman Reg McGhee would not comment. 
</P>
<P>
	AFL-CIO counsel Larry Gold said the organization had received  
something regarding a dispute over Honda's Ohio operations, but he 
would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW represents workers in the auto industry's ``Big Three''  
-- Ford, General Motors and Chrysler -- but has not been successful 
in unionizing the work force at U.S. plants run exclusively by a 
Japanese company, including Honda. The UAW filed election petitions 
for Ohio Honda workers in 1985 and 1989, but no elections were 
held. 
</P>
<P>
	``While no new election petitions have been filed in recent  
years, the UAW has never abandoned its contacts with its UAW 
in-plant organizing committee,'' the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Teamsters Local 413 of Columbus has been gathering signatures  
from workers at Honda's four Ohio plants and plans to file a 
petition with the National Labor Relations Board later this month. 
Honda workers say they went to the Teamsters, known for organizing 
the freight industry, because they were not making progress with 
the UAW. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't violated anything. Those people came to us. We  
never went to them,'' Local 413 President Dave Carter said. He said 
the local would continue its organizing efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Chip Roth, spokesman for the International Brotherhood of  
Teamsters, said the union was still reviewing the complaint, dated 
April 27, and wasn't sure what its next step would be. 
</P>
<P>
	Local 413 was handling the labor push for the Honda plants, but  
the International would be available to assist if the Teamsters 
choose to fight the complaint, Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda, which began building motorcycles in Ohio in 1979,  
operates plants in Anna, East Liberty and two in Marysville. The 
company employs about 13,200 in the state.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Stops Gun Exports to Venezuela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department, citing a sharp increase  
in the flow of firearms and ammunition to Venezuela, has 
temporarily suspended licenses for such exports to the South 
American nation, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials said licenses were issued for the sale of more  
than 80,000 handguns from the United States to Venezuela last year, 
a threefold increase over 1997 and sevenfold over 1996. Licenses 
for the sale of 49 million rounds of ammunition also were approved. 
</P>
<P>
	The moratorium, instituted on April 1, will remain in place  
while the U.S. and Venezuelan governments review the situation. The 
officials said they did not know where the weapons and ammunition 
ended up. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration also is contacting arms exporters to  
determine whether the increase in license applications is also 
translating into an increase in actual exports. 
</P>
<P>
	A New York Times account of the issue said the ban was imposed  
out of concern that many of the guns were ending up in the hands of 
narcotics gangs and guerrilla groups in neighboring Colombia.

	Greenspan Hails Productivity Gains  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan called  
the economy's strong growth and low inflation ``truly phenomenal'' 
today but also expressed worries about ``imbalances in our 
expansion'' -- and that sent jitters through Wall Street. Investors 
and analysts saw Greenspan's comments as a warning signal that even 
though America is currently enjoying the best combination of rapid 
growth, low unemployment and low inflation in three decades, the 
central bank is worried. Greenspan voiced oncern that the 
high-flying stock market might fall, but most especially he worried 
about tight labor markets that could trigger inflationary trends.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices fluctuated again today and ended  
lower, unable to shake off growing worries about inflation that 
were fed by cautionary remarks from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 8.59 at 
10,946.82. The Dow followed the same path it took in yesterday's 
session, changing direction several times. It fell as much as 103 
points during afternoon trading today before regaining ground. 
Broader market indicators also were mostly lower. The Standard &AMP; 
Poor's 500 index was down 15.23 at 1,332.08, and the Nasdaq 
composite index was down 61.27 at 2,473.18.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sales at many of nation's biggest retailers  
soared to better-than-expected levels in April as the continued 
strength of the U.S. economy encouraged Americans to do lots of 
shopping last month. It was the third straight month of 
surprisingly strong sales, boding well for earnings reports. A 
number of chains -- including the Limited and Ann Taylor -- have said 
they will top forecasts. The big winners in April were specialty 
clothing chains, while department stores also fared well. 
Discounters were strong, as shoppers turned to stores like Wal-Mart 
and Kmart for their wide selection and affordable prices.

	FCC Staff Mulls SBC-Ameritech Merger

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- SBC Communications' planned takeover of  
Ameritech, which would create the nation's largest local phone 
company, should be subject to conditions to protect consumers and 
competition, a top FCC official said today. If such conditions are 
not imposed, the Federal Communications Commission staff reviewing 
the planned merger had tentatively concluded that it ``flunks the 
public interest test,'' said Thomas Krattenmaker, one of the key 
staff involved in the commission's review. FCC staffers were 
holding a hearing today to gather information from the merger's 
supporters, opponents and others on what possible conditions should 
be. The meeting is to continue tomorrow.

someone's private financial data. The vote was 95-2 for the 
amendment to sweeping legislation the Senate is considering that 
would let banks, securities firms and insurance companies get more 
deeply into each other's businesses. The measure, proposed by Sen. 
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, 
responded to Americans' growing concern over privacy in an era of 
consolidations creating huge financial institutions selling 
everything from checking accounts to mutual funds.

	Greenspan: Robbers Pose Y2K Threat  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is not  
worried that the world's financial markets will come crashing down 
because of the Year 2000 computer problem. His fear is more basic -- 
a rash of robberies spawned by people keeping too much cash lying 
around. In a speech to a Chicago audience, Greenspan worried that 
the news media will so dramatize the dangers of computer system 
meltdowns on Jan. 1, 2000, that the fears will affect the real 
economy. ``I know the evening news is going to play it as though we 
are looking at an asteroid which is about to hit us,'' said 
Greenspan. He said he is concerned that people will become 
vulnerable to robbers who see an opportunity to get their hands 
``on real cash.''

The joint venture with TRW and Telecom Italia, named Astrolink, 
plans to launch the first of four satellites in 2002, providing 
service in Europe and North and South America beginning in 2003. 
The next three satellites are to be launched at six-month 
intervals, expanding the network worldwide, the companies said. The 
initiative by aerospace contractor Lockheed follows a similar 
project started by Hughes Electronics, a unit of General Motors

	Seagram Loses $199M in 3rd Quarter

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Seagram Co., the media and liquor company, lost  
$199 million in its third quarter as more disappointments at the 
box office wiped out profits in other divisions. The company blamed 
the loss on several poorly performing movies, incluing ``EdTV'' and 
``Virus.'' Another poor set of movie releases in the quarter before 
that also resulted in lower revenues from home video rentals, which 
kick in several months after theater releases. The $199 million net 
loss, which translated to 50 cents per share, compared to net 
profits of $461 million, or $1.32 per share, in the same period a 
year ago.

<HEADLINE> No Charges for Police Shooters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) -- Four police officers were justified  
when they fired 23 bullets at a young black woman they found 
sitting armed and unresponsive in a disabled car, the district 
attorney said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Grover Trask said the officers may have acted  
hastily and made mistakes in judgment, but they did not act 
criminally when they killed Tyisha Miller, 19, in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Miller's death led to allegations that the officers -- three  
whites and a Hispanic -- were racists. Religious leaders, civil 
rights activists and residents of Riverside, 60 miles east of Los 
Angeles, protested the shooting at town hall meetings, vigils and 
marches. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought we were going to get justice but we just got the  
same old thing,'' said the Rev. Bernell Butler, Ms. Miller's 
cousin. ``Police officers are able to murder and get away with 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State Attorney General Bill Lockyer endorsed Trask's decision,  
saying the police actions were ``unwise and ill-conceived'' but not 
sufficient for criminal charges. He said he would investigate 
reports of ``racial insensitivity'' within the Riverside Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Miller had pulled into a gas station parking lot with a flat  
tire. Relatives who arrived to help her said they called police 
after Ms. Miller appeared to be having a seizure and was foaming at 
the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers found the car still running, with the radio and  
lights on. Inside, Ms. Miller was unresponsive, lying on the fully 
reclined driver's seat with a gun in her lap. The officers were 
unable to awaken her by banging on the windows, shining lights or 
shaking the car, Trask said. 
</P>
<P>
	When an officer tried to break the driver's side window with a  
baton and reach for the gun, Ms. Miller sat up, lifted a pager and 
stared at the cop, who backed away, Trask said. 
</P>
<P>
	One officer yelled at the others to hold their fire, and the  
woman lay down again, Trask said. When she rose up again and 
appeared to reach for the gun, the officers all fired, the 
prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
	A coroner's report indicated all the bullets entered her body  
from the back, proving that she was not laying down when she was 
shot, Trask said. Her loaded gun was never fired. Ms. Miller was 
hit by 12 of the 23 bullets. Four struck her in the head. 
</P>
<P>
	Toxicology tests showed Ms. Miller had a blood-alcohol level of  
.13 percent. A driver in California is legally intoxicated at .08 
percent. Tests also detected marijuana residue. 
</P>
<P>
	Trask said the officers' plan to break in the window of Ms.  
Miller's locked car to get the gun out of her lap may have been a 
mistake, but it did not reach the level of criminal conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``In deciding whether or not to file criminal charges, the job  
was not to determine what the police could have done or even what 
they should have done,'' Trask said.

<HEADLINE> National Semiconductor Out of PCs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA,Calif. (AP) -- National Semiconductor Corp. plans to  
eliminate 550 jobs and stop developing technology for sub-$1,000 
personal computers, blaming a highly competitive market and a 
decline in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will immediately cease slugging it out in the PC processor  
market, which has been dragging down our financial performance for 
several quarters,'' National chairman Brian Halla said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision came less than two years after National bought  
Richardson, Texas-based Cyrix Corp. for about $550 million to build 
microprocessors for low-cost PCs. 
</P>
<P>
	National is also planning to sell a majority interest in its  
South Portland, Maine, wafer fabrication plant, a relatively new 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
	National Semiconductor Corp. celebrated the opening of the  
multimillion dollar manufacturing facility in June of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant produces 8-inch silicon wafers that form the circuitry  
inside devices such as cellular phones and small computers. 
</P>
<P>
	In March 1997, National Semiconductor sold off neighboring  
Fairchild Semiconductor in South Portland for $550 million. 
</P>
<P>
	That spinoff was designed to free National of its lower-margin,  
memory- and logic-chip operations and enable it to focus on its 
more profitable primary business, making mixed-signal chips, which 
convert analog and digital signals. 
</P>
<P>
	The 550 job cuts will be made through early retirement,  
attrition and layoffs, and includes 165 job cuts previously 
announced in Singapore. Overall, it represents about 5 percent of 
the company's employees worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Treasury To Auction $27B in Notes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Treasury Department announced some details  
on Wednesday of the government's April-June refunding plan, which 
is expected to include paying off a record $116 billion of the $5.5 
trillion national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a great accomplishment,'' said Treasury Secretary Robert  
Rubin in a statement. ``Less government debt outstanding means 
lower interest rates, higher national savings, more investment and 
a stronger economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government plans to sell $27 billion of new securities at  
its quarterly refunding auctions next week, Treasury officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It will sell $15 billion in five-year notes in minimum amounts  
of $1,000 on May 11, and $12 billion in 10-year notes in minimum 
amounts of $1,000 on May 12. Proceeds from the sales will be used 
to redeem $28.8 million in maturing notes and to pay down $1.8 
billion in debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury undersecretary for domestic finance, Gary Gensler,  
estimated that after its record $116 billion quarterly debt 
pay-down, the government will have a cash balance of $55 billion at 
the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
	He estimated that the government will pay down about another $10  
billion in debt from July through September, leaving it with a $45 
billion cash balance at the end of its 1999 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	The once-rare but now increasingly common reductions in federal  
debt are the result of the return to annual federal budget 
surpluses after 28 consecutive years of deficit, from 1969 through 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	About $320 billion of in debt so far has been paid down in just  
over two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Gensler said the Clinton administration is considering  
suggestions that the government buy back some of its outstanding 
securities if surpluses continue as expected.

<HEADLINE> Spurs Riding High in Playoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- The party's over. It's back to work today for  
the San Antonio Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	After winning the Midwest Division title and securing the No. 1  
seed in the Western Conference, the Spurs face No. 8 Minnesota in a 
best-of-5 series beginning Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a couple of days of good practice and we'll work  
hard,'' said San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich. ``We realize as a 
team everything we've done to date, you can put that aside now. It 
doesn't matter anymore. We've got to start from scratch and prove 
it all over again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs were pretty convincing down the stretch with four huge  
victories in five days, capped by Wednesday's 88-81 win at Golden 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Saturday, the Spurs beat Portland in overtime in the  
Alamodome, then defeated Utah the next day in the dome. On Tuesday 
the Spurs beat the Trailblazers in Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	Had the Spurs lost to the Warriors in the final game, San  
Antonio would have been seeded No. 3 in the Western Conference 
behind Utah and Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio and Utah each went 37-13 this season, but the Spurs  
claimed the Midwest Division crown and the conference title because 
they won their season series against the Jazz 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still think Utah with their experience is still the team to  
beat. But, boy, right now I wouldn't want to be any other team than 
us,'' said Spurs center David Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, a 10-year veteran who has often been disappointing in  
the postseason, has been playing his best basketball of the season 
lately. 
</P>
<P>
	In three of the final four games he scored more than 20 points.  
He had a season-high 29 points Tuesday night at Portland, and 23 
points and 20 rebounds in Wednesday night's finale in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team is farther along than any team I've ever been on,''  
said Robinson. ``I'm excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of jubilant San Antonio fans, cheering and carrying  
signs saying ``Go Spurs Go,'' greeted the players on a warm, 
cloudless afternoon as the team arrived at the airport Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty awesome,'' said forward Sean Elliott. ``I wonder  
what's going to happen if we win this series. They're going to rip 
the roof off this city. That'd be cool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing shirts proclaiming ``Midwest Division Champions,'' the  
players said they were enjoying the moment before practices resumed 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a small feat on a big journey,'' said point guard Avery  
Johnson. ``We still have a long, long, long, long, long way to go. 
But at the same time, we're going in the right direction.''

<HEADLINE> Court Strikes U.S. Encryption Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Government limits on the export of computer  
encryption codes, which scramble data to prevent eavesdropping, are 
a violation of freedom of expression, a federal appeals court ruled 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling is a blow to the Clinton administration, which limits  
exports of the most powerful encryption technology because it fears 
law enforcement agencies won't be able to read the messages of 
criminals or terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	But the high-tech industry wants relaxed restrictions so it can  
take full advantage of the booming market for encryption programs 
as Internet commerce increases. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, upholding a lower-court  
ruling, said encryption codes contain expressions of ideas and 
cannot be suppressed indefinitely by government officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cryptographers use source code to express their scientific  
ideas in much the same way that mathematicians use equations or 
economists use graphs,'' Judge Betty Fletcher wrote in the 2-1 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	An advocacy group for computer privacy applauded the ruling.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a giant step forward in bringing down export controls,''  
said Tara Lemmey, president of the Electronic Frontier Foundation 
in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision upheld the 1996 ruling in the case of Daniel  
Bernstein, an Illinois mathematics professor who wanted to post his 
encryption formula on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Fletcher wrote that Bernstein and other scientists ``have been  
effectively chilled from engaging in valuable scientific 
expression.'' However, a court order preventing Bernstein from 
posting his code remains in effect pending the government's 
decision on whether to appeal further. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling declares the regulations invalid in the nation's  
largest federal appellate circuit, which covers nine Western 
states. The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati is 
preparing to review another judge's ruling upholding the same 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	The departments of Justice and Commerce, which reviews  
encryption licenses, had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not expect that this battle is over,'' said Bernstein's  
lawyer, Cindy Cohn. But she said the ruling was ``a huge, giant 
step along the road so that the government can't prevent people 
from developing this tool, this science.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bernstein, now at the University of Illinois at Chicago,  
developed an encryption program called Snuffle as an undergraduate 
at the University of California at Berkeley in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, the State Department, which then ran the  
regulatory program, told him he could not post his code on the 
Internet without an export license, which he has been unable to 
get. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration recently liberalized its rules to  
allow encryption of some electronically posted credit card 
information. But in most cases, the regulations still treat 
encryption codes like military weapons and forbid their export 
without a license.

	Accessible design also could benefit other users, including  
people who access the Web from mobile phones or if their connection 
speed is too slow to support viewing images or video. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Tornado Wreckage Spews Guns Debris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Carlos Porcadas doesn't own a gun and  
doesn't hunt. But as he rummaged through the remains of his 
tornado-ravaged home, he turned up a lever-action .30-30-caliber 
hunting rifle. 
</P>
<P>
	Porcadas hardly noticed the weapon except to wonder where it  
came from. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not mine,'' said the postal carrier, whose two  
daughters played nearby under his wife's supervision Wednesday. He 
said the gun literally fell from the sky. 
</P>
<P>
	Police in communities along the path of the tornado are finding  
numerous guns in the debris left after Monday's devastating 
twisters. 
</P>
<P>
	That guns were present in many of the houses destroyed is not  
unusual in Oklahoma, which has an estimated 1.1 million gun owners 
and issued 286,117 hunting licenses last year. But so many guns 
lying around in the open, available to just about anyone, is both 
unusual and reason for concern. 
</P>
<P>
	By Wednesday morning, Oklahoma City police had taken possession  
of 41 guns that had been found by searchers looking for survivors. 
More were expected to be found. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we find them we secure them,'' Capt. Charles Allen said.  
``We have a moral responsibility to secure those so that they don't 
fall into the wrong hands or somebody trip on them or pick one up 
and it go off accidentally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said police will work with residents to try to return lost  
guns to their owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Del City police Sgt. Jody Suit said officers in that suburb have  
turned in 18 firearms so far, including pistols, shotguns and 
rifles. 
</P>
<P>
	A man who refused to give his name pestered Del City police  
about checking on his house, which was in an area closed to the 
public for safety reasons, until an officer agreed to escort him to 
the site Tuesday. Once there, the first thing he looked for was his 
Ruger handgun. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a real good pistol,'' he told an officer. ``I wouldn't  
want it to fall in the wrong hands.''

<HEADLINE> Marine Claims Camp Lejeune Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- Four Marines were thrown in the brig,  
accused of kicking a fellow enlisted man while he was wrapped in a 
blanket and rupturing his spleen. 
</P>
<P>
	Lance Cpl. Brian Edward Haynes, 20, of Lexington, Ky., said he  
was pulled from his bunk and attacked without provocation April 19. 
He was hospitalized for five days and is on medical leave, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marine Corps officially prohibited hazing in 1997. But  
Marine spokesman Lt. Nick Ritzcovan said of the alleged incident: 
``It looks like a simple assault case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In March, a Marine was given seven months in jail for binding a  
fellow serviceman by the hands and ankles in a hazing on Okinawa. 
In 1998, four Marine trainees pleaded guilty to beating an enlisted 
man in a hazing at Fort Knox, Ky.

<HEADLINE> Garth Brooks Honored at Music Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. (AP) -- Garth Brooks was the story of the  
night, the year and the decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Academy of Country Music bestowed its top award for the  
1990s -- artist of the decade -- and branded the Oklahoma native its 
entertainer of the year during its 34th awards presentations 
Wednesday night. Faith Hill was a big winner, too, taking home four 
awards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Universal Amphitheatre audience leaped to its feet and  
cowboys took off their Stetsons when Jay Leno announced Brooks won 
the decade's top honor. Marty Robbins, Loretta Lynn and Alabama won 
in previous decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks, the best-selling male singer in music history who has  
sold more than 95 million albums, said he wasn't deserving of the 
recognition. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me there's two artists in our industry that I think we  
have very much taken for granted -- I don't mean to offend anybody, 
I'm just telling you like it is,'' Brooks told the audience, saying 
he wanted to cut the plaque in half. 
</P>
<P>
	``George (Strait) isn't here for one half,'' he said. ``The  
other half I think we need to give to an artist that has given 
everything an artist can give to country music, and I don't think 
has been thanked near enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks left the stage to hand the award to Reba McEntire, but to  
his surprise she wasn't in her seat. The gesture drew wild cheers 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks recently completed a 33-month concert tour that sold more  
than 5.3 million tickets, the most successful tour ever by a 
singer. 
</P>
<P>
	For pure excitement, it was the jubilant wins by Hill that stole  
the evening. She hauled off more awards than anyone, including 
female vocalist, single record and video for ``This Kiss'' and 
vocal event of the year for her duet ``Just to Hear You Say That 
You Love Me'' with husband Tim McGraw. McGraw also won the top male 
singer award. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a replay for McGraw and his wife. Last year, they walked  
away with four academy trophies for their duet ``It's Your Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas-based Dixie Chicks -- sisters Martie Siedel and Emily  
Erwin and friend Natalie Maines -- won album of the year for ``Wide 
Open Spaces'' as well as top group and best new group. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Wariner's oh-so-sad ``Holes in the Floor of Heaven'' was  
top song. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my first one! I guess I'm a hat act now!'' said  
Wariner, who shared the songwriting honor with Billy Kirsch. 
</P>
<P>
	Newcomer Jo Dee Messina, produced by McGraw, won the new female  
vocalist award. Atlanta's Mark Wills, known for his ballad ``Wish 
You Were Here,'' was the new male vocalist winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Shania Twain was presented with the Recording Industry  
Association of America's first diamond award for recognition of 10 
million in album sales. It was a double-diamond for the Canadian 
sensation, who sold more than 10 million copies each of ``The Woman 
in Me'' and ``Come on Over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A special Pioneer Award was presented to Glen Campbell.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can't tell you how short a period it seems like -- 32 years --  
to 1967, and now I'm up here getting the Pioneer Award. Then I was 
getting the go get 'em award, you know. Time flies when you're 
having a big time,'' Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Winners were selected by the 3,000 members of the Academy of  
Country Music.

<HEADLINE> FCC Staff Mulls SBC-Ameritech Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumers and competition must be protected  
before SBC Communications and Ameritech are allowed to merge into 
the nation's largest local phone company, a top FCC official said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Communications Commission staff opened a two-day hearing  
Thursday on what possible conditions could be placed on the $57 
billion merger to satisfy their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Krattenmaker, who is leading the staff review, believes  
that the companies, whose local phone territories abut, -- probably 
would eliminate their biggest potential competitor -- each other -- 
by merging. 
</P>
<P>
	Staff members also raised concerns that an SBC-Ameritech would  
be so powerful it would discourage other companies from invading 
the merged companies 13-state local phone territory to provide 
competing services. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC and Ameritech attorneys rejected both concerns, contending  
that the merger would benefit consumers and competition. The 
companies, they said, must merge to become more efficient and 
financially able to do business in markets outside their region, 
which they said the companies cannot do separately. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies also need to merge to become major players in the  
global telecommunications market, the attorneys said. AT&AMP;T and 
other rivals are merging for the same reasons, they added. 
</P>
<P>
	``This merger is about growth,'' said Ameritech's counsel,  
Richard Hetke. 
</P>
<P>
	But Krattenmaker said FCC staff members are looking into  
possible conditions because they had tentatively concluded that the 
merger ``flunks the public interest test.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The current mission ... is to devise conditions that can  
transform the merger to one that is on balance beneficial,'' 
Krattenmaker added. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC's five commissioners hope to make a decision this summer  
on the $57 billion merger, which has been approved by the Justice 
Department. The merger must be supported by at least three FCC 
commissioners to be approved. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman Bill Kennard indicated he would like to see the deal  
move forward, saying he has asked the agency's staff to continue 
work on ``a set of conditions designed to address the public 
interest concerns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for SBC and Ameritech said their companies don't  
believe any conditions are warranted but indicated they are willing 
to make some concessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Atkinson, another key figure in the FCC's review, said  
the commission staff had three goals to guide possible conditions: 
</P>
<P>
	--Ensure a combined SBC-Ameritech aggressively competes outside  
its 13-state local region, particularly for residential and small 
business customers, who now have little choice of local providers. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ensure other companies that own their own telecommunications  
networks can compete inside the combined company's 13-state region. 
</P>
<P>
	--Hold SBC and Ameritech to any commitments they make.  
</P>
<P>
	SBC and Ameritech, supported by major telephone unions, say the  
merger will spur local phone competition and possibly lower prices, 
accelerate the roll-out of high-speed Internet access and data 
services and create jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups, AT&AMP;T, MCI WorldCom, Sprint and others want the  
FCC to block the merger, contending it would thwart local phone 
competition and the prospect of lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13 states involved in the proposed merger are Arkansas,  
California, Connecticut, Kansas, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, 
Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> SuperSonics End Sour Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- How far did the Seattle SuperSonics fall this  
season? To put it bluntly, they were the most disappointing team in 
the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Lakers and New York Knicks were disappointing,  
too, but at least made the playoffs. For the first time in nine 
years, the Sonics didn't. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the presence of All-Stars Gary Payton and Vin Baker, the  
Sonics dropped from being a championship contender in the West. 
Like a rock. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take the responsibility that we are where we are,'' general  
manager Wally Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
	After firing George Karl, who has the best winning percentage  
among Sonics coaches in the franchise's history, Walker watched in 
horror from his courtside seat. 
</P>
<P>
	He saw a few good things. And a lot of bad things.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've just got to take our lumps and not make excuses,''  
Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Payton would have been in the All-Star game again this season --  
if the lockout hadn't canceled the game. The out-of-shape, injured 
Baker would not. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of Baker's lackluster season and subpar seasons by  
Billy Owens and Hersey Hawkins, the Sonics finished ninth in the 
Western Conference with a 25-25 record. 
</P>
<P>
	They had to beat the Clippers 107-105 Wednesday night in Los  
Angeles to avoid having a losing season. Minnesota also was 25-25 
this season, but made the playoffs over Seattle because of a 
tiebreaker. The Timberwolves won two of three from the Sonics. 
</P>
<P>
	``All we can do is to make sure it never happens again like  
this,'' first-year coach Paul Westphal said. 
</P>
<P>
	How could a team that won 61 games and its third straight  
Pacific Division in Karl's final season in Seattle last year fall 
so far so fast? 
</P>
<P>
	And what will be Barry Ackerley's reaction, especially if Walker  
and Westphal don't right the Sonics' ship next season? 
</P>
<P>
	Remember, this is the owner who complained about Karl before the  
playoffs last season that he didn't have a championship ring. Now, 
Ackerley finds himself with a lottery team and he can't be happy 
about that, especially if home attendance falls off dramatically 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
	In Milwaukee, where Karl landed with a $20 million coaching  
contract, the Bucks are in the playoffs. In Portland, where former 
Sonics team president Bob Whitsitt wound up after being fired by 
Ackerley, the Trail Blazers are hoping to make a title run. 
</P>
<P>
	In Seattle, the Sonics are trying to live down the most  
disappointing season in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never expected to be where we are,'' Walker said.  
</P>
<P>
	Before the season finally began following the lockout three  
months ago, Walker signed free agents Owens and Olden Polynice from 
Sacramento and traded Jim McIlvaine to New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	The McIlvaine trade was an excellent one -- addition by  
subtraction -- but Polynice, Seattle's starting center, and the 
oft-injured Owens did not work out. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker said he won't talk specifics until next week about the  
Sonics' future, but the team isn't expected to retain Polynice, who 
played this season under a one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Payton carried the Sonics on his shoulders this season and got a  
lot of help from Detlef Schrempf, 36. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Sonics liked the development of their trio of rookies;  
Jelani McCoy, Vladimir Stepania and Rashard Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hawkins, 32, slowed considerably and the Sonics could not  
maintain the high level of play they had under Karl. 
</P>
<P>
	Not too much blame should be heaped on Westphal, though. It  
wasn't his fault that Owens and Baker didn't expect a season and 
weren't in shape before becoming injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``Paul came into a tough situation,'' Walker said. ``I respect  
the way he handled it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Out of coaching after being fired in Phoenix during the 1995-96  
season, Westphal said he enjoyed his season as a coach in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coaching in the NBA is great,'' he said. ``It's definitely got  
its ups and downs. It makes you appreciate the ups all the more 
when you have to go through a few downs. And you don't want those 
downs to last too long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sonics are expected to try to re-sign Baker, a four-time  
All-Star power forward who came to them, in effect, in a trade for 
Shawn Kemp before last season. 
</P>
<P>
	In order to avoid losing Baker as a free agent, the team will  
have to pay a harsh price. Under the league's new labor agreement, 
he can demand $87 million for seven seasons. Baker hardly looked 
like an $87 million player this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker and Westphal also are expected to try to bring back  
Schrempf for a 15th NBA season -- if they can convince him that he 
won't have to go through another season like this one. 
</P>
<P>
	McCoy, Stepania and Lewis will have a full summer to work out  
and the Sonics hope they will make major contributions next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Another key in the offseason for the Sonics will be trying to  
convince Payton that things will improve in Seattle. An unhappy 
Payton could cause Walker and Westphal fits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sonics don't expect Payton to demand a trade this summer.  
</P>
<P>
	``Gary's going to be here,'' Walker said. ``He's a huge part of  
this franchise. He knows how we feel about him.''

<HEADLINE> Fatal Racing Accident Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- Investigators studying an accident at  
Lowe's Motor Speedway will try to reenact the flight of a wheel 
that broke off a car and went into the stands, killing three 
spectators and injuring eight. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the investigation by the speedway's insurer, K&AMP;K  
Insurance Group, involves using a crane to try to retrace the 
flight of a wheel that snapped loose during a three-car wreck at 
Saturday's Indy Racing League event, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash, which occurred at speeds near 215 mph, sent the wheel  
and suspension parts rocketing into the fourth-turn grandstands. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of people scratching their heads right now  
trying to think these things through,'' said Doug Hamm, senior vice 
president of Fort Wayne, Ind.-based K&AMP;K. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators decided to bring a crane to the speedway in the  
coming days because of a 10-second piece of videotape that shows 
the wheel landing in the stands, officials said. The videotape, 
which was shot by a spectator who refused to identify himself when 
he dropped it off at the track late Monday night, does not show the 
crash or the ascent of the wheel over the speedway's 15-foot-high 
catch fence. 
</P>
<P>
	But investigators believe the tape shows enough for them to try  
to reenact the wheel's flight by using a crane and working backward 
from the top of the flight path, possibly telling them more about 
the source of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of times you find out that three or four things had to  
have happened for this all to take place,'' Hamm said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators believe the tape can help them estimate such  
things as the top height of the wheel and its angles of both ascent 
and descent. Based on those variables, investigators are hopeful of 
then matching information from the reenactment with the IRL's 
timing and scoring tapes from the race, possibly helping them 
pinpoint the crash's origin, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since investigators have no video of the start of the wreck,  
they are still uncertain whether the wheel flew directly into the 
stands or was catapulted over the fence by making contact with 
another car. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want to make sure you've got it right,'' Hamm said.  
``They'll confer with all the experts. It could be a week or two 
before we know anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The height of Charlotte's safety fence conforms with industry  
standards, but speedway engineers have drafted plans to both raise 
its height and extend the 35-inch-long canopy that extends from the 
top of the fence. 
</P>
<P>
	Learning more about the path of the wheel's upward flight from  
the racing surface could factor into the track's plans for altering 
the catch fence around the 1.5-mile, high-banked superspeedway. 
</P>
<P>
	The only one of the eight injured people still hospitalized,  
Haley McGee, 9, of Conover, N.C., remained in critical condition 
Thursday at Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte. McGee, who has 
swelling on her brain, also has developed pneumonia, her family 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The speedway reopened Wednesday for two days of testing for  
Winston Cup cars. No spectators were allowed in the stands 
Wednesday because the session, booked by General Motors for its 
teams, was considered a private test. 
</P>
<P>
	But numerous fans came to the track Wednesday asking if they  
could come in, sit in the stands and watch. They were turned away, 
but when more showed up Thursday and made the same request, GM 
allowed the speedway to open its gates. Dozens of fans filtered in 
and out throughout the day, relaxing in the seats above the 
frontstretch while the cars, many of them lacking paint jobs or 
numbers, turned lap after lap.

<HEADLINE> WTO Still Seeking Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The World Trade Organization's efforts to appoint  
a new chief again sank deeper into procedural wrangling Thursday, 
nearly a week after its outgoing leader officially stepped down. 
</P>
<P>
	The 134-member WTO General Council ended its fourth session  
since Friday with no signs of progress toward breaking the deadlock 
over a new secretary-general to succeed Italy's Renato Ruggiero, 
diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We, the members, should be ashamed of the spectacle before  
us,'' Mexican ambassador Alejandro de la Pena told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	European Union ambassador Roderick Abbott, who left the 5 1/2-hour  
meeting early, said: ``We are going round and round in circles. We 
have to take a good break and calm down and start talking 
substance, because what is going on here is useless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The council was expected to meet again next week or early the  
week after. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO is in the embarrassing situation of trying to put its  
own house in order with only months remaining before a conference 
in Seattle meant to open the way for a new round of trade 
liberalization talks, and with just days until the possible start 
of another transatlantic trade war. 
</P>
<P>
	Former New Zealand Premier Mike Moore looked set to win last  
week after the council chairman proposed Moore formally. The 
chairman said he considered the other candidate, Thai Deputy 
Premier Supachai Panitchpakdi, to be out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	But Supachai's supporters, led by Japan and the ASEAN group of  
countries, refused to concede defeat. They said the chairman, 
Tanzanian Ambassador Ali Mchumo, had no authority to exclude any 
candidate and insisted the consultation process had been flawed. 
</P>
<P>
	Supachai supporters say more than 50 of the WTO's 134 members  
are holding out for the Thai candidate. Kenya has proposed that 
Mchumo try to reach a consensus around Supachai. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO chooses its secretary-general by consensus rather than  
by election. Supachai's backers insist a consensus over Moore is 
unreachable. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore's supporters, which include the United States and many  
Latin American countries, said they still believe consensus is 
possible and called for Supachai to withdraw with dignity.

<TEXT>
<P>
	BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) -- Hungary's sports and youth minister  
Thursday lifted the suspension of Hungarian Soccer Federation 
president Attila Kovacs. 
</P>
<P>
	The action, which will be effective Monday, ended more than  
three months of wrangling between the ministry and FIFA, the 
international soccer federation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am withdrawing my suspension of the federation's  
president,'' Tamas Deutsch told TV3, citing pressure from FIFA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel one must bow before such overwhelming power,'' Deutsch  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day he met with Kovacs and made the announcement  
official. 
</P>
<P>
	When Deutsch suspended Kovacs, he said it was because of  
questions concerning the federation's finances. 
</P>
<P>
	Kovacs said Thursday that an audit will be done and should be  
completed next month. 
</P>
<P>
	FIFA general secretary Michel Zen-Ruffinen had told Deutsch to  
restore Kovacs immediately or face a suspension of the entire 
Hungarian soccer federation.

<HEADLINE> GOP Tries for Tax Relief in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With little cash available for significant tax  
cuts in 2000, Republicans in Congress are focusing on a phased-in 
approach that promises huge tax relief in the future -- and they 
hope it won't escape voters' attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think our commitment to reduce the tax burden on all  
taxpayers is a worthy goal,'' said Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., who 
ranks No. 3 in Senate leadership. ``I don't think there's a penalty 
to be paid because we don't do enough the first year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike last year's ``April surprise,'' the Congressional Budget  
Office will not raise projections for this year's budget surplus 
until July 1 at the earliest, a spokesman said. That dashes GOP 
hopes for an immediate infusion of cash for election-year tax cuts, 
particularly important as Yugoslavia war costs rise. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's zip for 2000,'' said Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., a  
member of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Senate Republicans met behind closed doors  
Thursday to discuss proposals ranging from cuts in capital gains 
taxes to relief from the so-called marriage penalty in which many 
two-earner couples pay more income taxes than if single. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., chairman of the Senate Budget  
Committee, said he told the group that tax relief totaling about 
$15 billion was possible for 2000. But others said it would be a 
mistake to concentrate on small-bore cuts, preferring to push hard 
for a huge 10-year cut of nearly $800 billion even if its full 
impact is delayed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to focus on the total amount, not a token tax cut,''  
said Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans began the year touting broad tax relief such as a 10  
percent across-the-board income tax cut, but there are now 
obstacles even to modest relief. First, the budget surplus for the 
next few years is driven by Social Security funds, money both 
parties have promised not to touch. 
</P>
<P>
	There is also a reluctance to cut government programs already  
strapped by caps on spending and the unknown future costs of the 
conflict over Kosovo. But the GOP is determined not to give up on 
its signature political issue, even if a major tax cut must be 
phased in slowly over the next decade as the non-Social Security 
budget surplus grows. 
</P>
<P>
	They are scouring the budget for ways to offset the costs of tax  
relief in the early years, including serious consideration of 
President Clinton's proposals to close several corporate tax 
shelters. 
</P>

	``We're looking to see where there are opportunities to raise  
revenues so we can give the working people a tax cut,'' said Sen. 
William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. 
``We want to give as large a tax cut as we can.''

	In the House, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer,  
R-Texas, has asked the committee's members to each submit three tax 
relief ideas to lay groundwork for a tax bill likely to move 
through the panel in July.

	Most lawmakers believe it will include several items that appeal  
to specific groups as well as extend popular expiring business 
provisions. Clinton took a similar approach in his tax plan with 
proposals such as credits for stay-at-home parents, breaks for the 
steel industry and credits for buyers of fuel-efficient cars.

	Mack unveiled a bill Thursday that embraces several GOP  
priorities: phasing out estate taxes, cutting capital gains tax 
rates, increasing the standard income tax deduction for married 
couples and singles and making the soon-to-expire business research 
and development tax credit permanent.

	Total cost over five years is roughly $140 billion -- partly  
because capital gains tax cuts actually raise money as investors 
sell more securities -- but it balloons to about $750 billion over 
10 years once all the provisions kick in.

	It doesn't appear there will be much Democratic help in passing  
a GOP-crafted bill. ``I frankly doubt that we are likely to support 
what they're going to produce,'' said House Minority Leader Dick 
Gephardt, D-Mo.
