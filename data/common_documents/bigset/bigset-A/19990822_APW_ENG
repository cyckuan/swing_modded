<HEADLINE> Ford To Begin Separate SUV Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. is heading outdoors for a  
fall advertising campaign to promote its expanding line of sport 
utility vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign, which begins with the start of the 2000 model year  
Oct. 1, will use the tagline ``no boundaries.'' Each ad will focus 
on outdoor activities in which Ford SUVs can be used. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford recently began selling its newest SUV, the Excursion, the  
largest on the market. It also plans to introduce the Explorer 
Sport Trac and F-150 SuperCrew -- two SUV-pickup combos -- early next 
year. A small SUV, tentatively called the Escape, debuts later in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The new entries join the popular Explorer and Expedition SUVs.  
</P>
<P>
	The campaign will be linked with special SUV displays at most  
Ford dealerships. The displays will have an outfitter theme and 
show the kind of gear SUVs can carry, such as bicycles, kayaks and 
camping equipment. Buyers will get a catalog of SUV accessories, 
which will also be displayed in the showrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``It allows us to differentiate the Ford showroom from the other  
volume brands in the marketplace,'' said brand manager J.C. 
Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	The approach is similar to that used by lower-volume SUV  
retailer Land Rover North America Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford also will have a ``no boundaries'' site on the World Wide  
Web and sponsor outdoors events, such as ski races and the World 
Outside Festival with Outside Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign will initially include television, print and  
billboard ads. Radio will be added later. 
</P>
<P>
	Actor John Corbett will narrate the TV ads, which were created  
by the J. Walter Thompson agency. Corbett, a regular in the late TV 
series ``Northern Exposure,'' has appeared in a series of ``story 
ads'' for Ford vehicles since early last year. 
</P>
<P>
	By lumping all of Ford's SUVs in one ad campaign, the No. 2  
automaker expects to get more out of its advertising dollars at a 
time when it's undertaking a big campaign to launch its new Focus 
line of subcompacts. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the number of launches that we have, we felt it was the  
most efficient and effective way to show the complete lineup that 
we have,'' Collins said Friday.

<HEADLINE> Free Postage Exchanged for Profile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The latest freebie being dangled before Internet  
users to coax them to share their personal information for a 
database: postage. 
</P>
<P>
	A South Florida company is giving away first-class, postage-paid  
envelopes to anyone willing to fill out an online application 
including questions on household income, education level, date of 
birth and what kind of car they drive. The survey is used to build 
a profile that will allow sponsors to target advertising and 
coupons on those envelopes based on that person's tastes or 
perceived needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Postage4Free.com Inc., a six-person operation founded this year,  
kicks off its Web site today. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers who complete the online application receive 10  
business-sized envelopes, each with a first-class 33-cent stamp, in 
the mail in four to six weeks, said Marisa Dottori, who co-founded 
the company. Customers can come back for reorders after three 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	The envelopes are sponsored by advertisers who get space for  
their pitch on the on the envelope or pay to have tear-off coupons 
attached to the back, Dottori said. The coupons are expected to be 
more lucrative because they target customers based on a profile, 
Dottori said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company expects millions of customers within six months,  
said Dottori. She said that assessment is based on an estimated 150 
million American Internet users and the fact the U.S. Postal 
Service delivers more than 107 billion pieces of first-class mail 
per year. 
</P>
<P>
	Dottori won't reveal the names of her company's advertising  
sponsors until after the first mailing. However, she said they 
include pizza, soft drink, cereal and video companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Dottori also declined to reveal advertising rates but said the  
tear-off coupons will be the priciest. ``For example, we know 
specifically that that person has a dog in their home so that's 
going to be a higher cost per thousand,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Giving away free stuff on the Internet is not new and has become  
big business. 
</P>
<P>
	Spurred by intense competition for Web surfers, the occasional  
come-on of a few years ago has exploded into a widespread 
commercial strategy -- key to drawing visitors to Internet sites, 
drawing advertisers who want to capture that audience and getting 
online businesses off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not just software and e-mail services. Like winners of a  
giant shopping spree, consumers can find items in Web categories 
stretching from technology to entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	Though figures on total Internet freebies were not available, a  
recent search looking for ``free'' and ``giveaway'' on the search 
engine AltaVista reveals more than 1,140,000 Web pages with both 
words. 
</P>
<P>
	The catch is that many of the free sites and services require  
bargain hunters to look at advertisements, give up personal 
information to marketers, or buy related products. 
</P>
<P>
	Products include music downloads, pornography and videos. There  
are desktop themes to jazz up any computer screen, animated 
greeting cards and a missing-person people finder. There are even 
free jokes. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing I've learned is that 'freebie' speaks louder to the  
consumer than anything,'' said David Marcus, CEO of Houseit.com, a 
Web site management company, an advertiser with Postage4Free.com.

<HEADLINE> Thousands See Dalai Lama in Ind. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- Billie Dreyfuss shelled out $700 to get  
her old car in shape for a trek from Las Cruces, N.M., to Indiana 
to see the Dalai Lama. 
</P>
<P>
	It was worth it, says Dreyfuss, among thousands who've descended  
on this city to watch the exiled Tibetan leader perform the 
Kalachakra, a Buddhist ceremony that means ``cycles of time'' and 
is intended to cleanse the Earth of violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``My car's been making some scary rumbling noises -- and I still  
have to get home. But right now I'm here and it's wonderful,'' 
Dreyfuss, 47, said Monday as she sat with a friend munching dried 
figs and apricots under a shade tree near the Tibetan Cultural 
Center outside Bloomington. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Dreyfuss arrived, she's been living out of her car, making  
daily trips to the cultural center founded by the Dalai Lama's 
older brother. The 100-acre park-like property, guarded now by 
watchful Secret Service agents, is where the 64-year-old Buddhist 
monk is hosting his ``Kalachakra for World Peace 1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dreyfuss attends daily prayer and meditation sessions in the  
retreat's huge air-conditioned tent with her newfound pal, Carolyn 
Matthews, 52, of Columbia, Mo., who hitched a ride to Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	The events cost $40 to $50 for daily admissions, but both women  
say it's money well-spent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dalai Lama drew a crowd of 40,000 at an appearance at New  
York's Central Park earlier this month. The Dalai Lama's current 
trip to the United States is drawing more spectators and media 
interest than previous trips. His visit to Central Park in 1991 
drew just 5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews and Dreyfuss say they are students -- not followers -- of  
the Dalai Lama, the exiled holy man who received the Nobel Peace 
Prize in 1989 for his work to liberate his native Tibet from 
Chinese control while opposing the use of violence. 
</P>
<P>
	John Karrqvist, a 25-year-old Swede who works in Ithaca, N.Y.,  
for a Swedish finance company, is on his third trek to see the 
Dalai Lama. Karrqvist, who along with three friends who booked 
hotel rooms six months ago, said seeing the Dalai Lama is 
enlightening. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just brings me amazing happiness,'' Karrqvist said during a  
lunch break at the cultural center's food court, where vendors hawk 
everything from sushi to roast beef sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
	The coming days will be the highlight of the Dalai Lama's 12-day  
Indiana stay at the center founded by his older brother, Thubten 
Norbu, a 79-year-old retired Indiana University professor. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 5,000 people a day are expected to converge on Bloomington  
to watch him perform the Kalachakra initiation, a series of 
Buddhist rituals and teachings intended to bring personal 
enlightenment and foster world peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Actors Richard Gere, Steven Seagal and Harrison Ford are  
expected to be among the throngs participating. The ritual involves 
creating a mandala, a painting crafted from colored sand 
representing a four-faced god with 24 arms who subdues violence. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the ceremony, the Dalai Lama will sweep up the  
sand and pour it into an as-yet undetermined body of water. 
Believers say the sands' healing qualities will sweep across the 
Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Watching the entire event unfold from a distance is Jim Pullon,  
who lives across the street from the cultural with his wife and two 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	``My daughter saw him come in yesterday in a black limousine,  
and he waved at her,'' Pullon said. ``She said `I saw the Lama.' 
But you know, she was really hoping to see Steven Seagal.''

<HEADLINE> Germany Seeks EU Liquor Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Germany's health minister wants European Union  
countries to require warnings on liquor bottles similar to those on 
cigarette packs and advertisements, a newspaper reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrea Fischer plans to propose the measure to her colleagues  
from the other 14 EU nations, Bild am Sonntag said. 
</P>
<P>
	The health warnings should be required at least for distilled  
spirits and liqueurs, she was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to inform even more heavily about the dangers of drugs  
and tobacco, but also alcohol,'' Fischer told the paper. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's states wanted to introduce warnings for beer and wine  
in 1997, but the plan was scrapped after protests by the industry, 
the report said.

<HEADLINE> IMF: Thai Growth To Pick Up 4 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund has  
predicted that Thailand's economic growth will reach 3 percent to 4 
percent this year, and could go as high as 5 percent in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Such growth would confirm a leap out of the Asian economic  
crisis Thailand triggered two years ago, when it floated its 
currency, the baht. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranjit Teja, chief of an IMF mission from Washington, spoke to  
reporters Friday after concluding a quarterly review of Thailand's 
performance under a $17.2 billion bailout package the IMF arranged 
in 1997 to reverse the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the economy shrank 8 percent overall last year, Ranjit  
said that recovery had been settling in since the end of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Thailand has withdrawn about $14 billion in credit, and another  
$500 million will become available by October. Ranjit said the Thai 
government may decide not to withdraw the funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as they are in compliance, they can withdraw it,''  
Ranjit said. But he added, ``Clearly the needs have diminished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thailand's foreign reserves stood at $31.9 billion as of Aug.  
13. At the depths of the crisis, they had gone from $25 billion to 
nearly zero. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has made gradual progress in restructuring the  
financial sector, though non-performing loans still account for a 
whopping 47 percent of total lending in the financial system. 
</P>
<P>
	Economic recovery so far has been driven by consumption and  
renewed growth in exports. More fiscal stimulus -- the government 
has already implemented two rounds of tax cuts this year -- may be 
needed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thailand's prospects are good, even if the U.S. economy begins  
to slow, the official said. Southeast Asia and Japan are bigger 
export markets for Thailand than the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	What is needed now are continuous efforts to restructure  
thousands of struggling companies and their debts, Ranjit said. 
</P>
<P>
	But while daily change may seem tortuously slow, the officials  
noted that the overall progress made by the government in 
implementing IMF-backed reforms has dramatically changed sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
	Reserves have been rebuilt, the baht stabilized, 56 failed  
finance companies liquidated, and six banks nationalized for merger 
and sale. Four state banks are due to be sold to the highest 
bidders by year-end.

<HEADLINE> First Lady, Giuliani in Money Chase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Neither Hillary Rodham Clinton nor Rudolph  
Giuliani is an official candidate, but both are deep into the money 
chase as they explore possible races for the U.S. Senate from New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Mrs. Clinton, the Democrat, and Giuliani, the Republican,  
are considered prodigious fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady has amply demonstrated her fund-raising ability  
in recent years, crisscrossing the country to help fellow Democrats 
-- and her husband -- fill campaign coffers. She is taking time out 
from a two-week family vacation to work the money circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani, the Republican mayor of New York, also has proven his  
ability to rake in the campaign cash. From April, when he formed 
his Senate exploratory committee, through June 30, the mayor 
reported raising $2.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, who formed her exploratory committee on July 6,  
does not have to make a report to the Federal Election Commission 
until later in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	But from the events Mrs. Clinton already has held or has  
scheduled over the next couple of weeks, spokesman Howard Wolfson 
estimates a take of about $1.5 million. ``It's going very well,'' 
he said confidently. 
</P>
<P>
	Six fund-raising events in Massachusetts and New York during the  
Clintons' two-week vacation are expected to rake in more than 
$600,000 for the first lady's Senate exploratory committee. A 
two-day trip to Texas for five fund-raising events just before the 
vacation netted Mrs. Clinton about $500,000, according to Wolfson. 
Four events held earlier in New York and Washington took in about 
$400,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Those fund-raising totals do not include money raised from a  
direct-mail campaign, personal telephone calls she has made and 
unsolicited donations. Wolfson said he did not know how much those 
efforts had netted. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady's fund-raising team has set a goal of $25 million  
for the race and Wolfson said he believes the target is well within 
reach. 
</P>
<P>
	New York's statewide races have become increasingly expensive.  
In last year's Senate race, the Republican incumbent Alfonse 
D'Amato spent more than $20 million in his losing bid for a fourth 
term. Democratic winner Charles Schumer spent more than $15 
million. Republican George Pataki spent more than $20 million last 
year in winning a second term as governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with the Clinton fund-raising prowess, Republicans and  
anti-Clinton conservatives are rallying their own troops. 
</P>
<P>
	New York GOP Chairman William Powers has launched a new Internet  
site specifically aimed at raising money to help finance 
anti-Hillary Clinton work. Other GOP state committees across the 
country have begun fund-raising efforts based on Mrs. Clinton's 
expected candidacy in New York. All or part of the money raised 
from those campaigns is to be filtered into New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, in early June, conservative radio talk show host Gary  
Nolan and veteran conservative strategist Craig Shirley announced a 
national drive to ``stop Hillary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope to raise $10 million,'' Nolan said, vowing that all of  
the money raised by Conservatives for Effective Leadership will be 
spent in an effort to defeat Mrs. Clinton in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	A letter from Nolan to 40,000 potential contributors warned that  
``the liberals want Hillary to be president,'' claimed she and her 
husband were corrupt and that ``she's a committed radical Marxist 
to boot!'' 
</P>
<P>
	In July, the first lady sent a fund-raising letter of her own to  
about 1 million potential donors noting that ``you and I have been 
through a lot together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope you will help me launch this effort by sending as  
generous a financial donation as you can afford,'' she wrote. 
``Together, I believe we can accomplish great things, for our 
families, for New York, and for our nation.''

<HEADLINE> Track Event Protesters Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Ten people detained by police for staging  
a political protest during the opening ceremony of the World 
Athletics Championships were freed without charges Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The breach of security at the Seville stadium was condemned by  
the national news media and politicians, who noted that the 
incident came at the same time the southern Andalusian city is 
bidding for the 2008 summer Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates of transferring ETA Basque prisoners from jails around  
Spain to cells closer to home, the intruders easily slipped into 
the stadium Friday night on regular tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of them, dressed as oversized official mascots with signs  
urging repatriation of the prisoners joined singers and the master 
of ceremonies on stage for 20 minutes before being dragged away by 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
	Other members of the group, admitted with knapsacks unveiled  
banners with the same propaganda and ropes. 
</P>
<P>
	Their protest was in full view of TV cameras and thousands of  
spectators at the 60,000-seat stadium, including Prince Felipe, son 
of King Juan Carlos and heir to the Spanish crown. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven men and three women, ranging in age from 22 to 34,  
were accused of public disorder and spent the weekend in detention. 
Police claimed one of them was the brother of an ETA leader who 
once headed the Madrid commando. 
</P>
<P>
	Seville Court Judge Auxiliadora Echevarria ordered their release  
Sunday morning after questioning them most of the night. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers representing the accused insisted they were not  
affiliated with ETA but were peaceful advocates of ETA demands that 
some 500 commandos jailed around Spain be moved to prisons in the 
Basque region. 
</P>
<P>
	The armed separatist group, which has killed nearly 800 people  
in its 31-year campaign for independence for the northern Basque 
land, declared a unilateral cease-fire nearly a year ago and 
recently entered talks with the government. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident received front page headlines in Madrid newspapers  
and editorial condemnation of the lax security at the 
championships. The main opposition Socialist Party demanded an 
explanation from Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja. 
</P>
<P>
	The country's top police commander, Juan Cotino, admitted  
``there was a failure on part of the organizers and also the 
security forces, which ought to have responded before the event 
took place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	El Mundo, a nationally distributed major daily published in  
Madrid, reported that the ticketed advocates managed to pass 
through three layers of security. One of the false mascots, ordered 
at the gate to remove his smiling costume head, complied but was 
allowed inside after genially observing how hot it was inside the 
inflated outfit, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	El Mundo noted that police blamed the organizers, who in turn  
blamed security forces, while politicians criticized their 
opponents in government. The newspaper urged a complete 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Security was tighter after the incident, even requiring  
spectators to open bottles of water before passing through the 
gates to insure they did not contain combustible liquids.

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices Continue Upward Trend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) -- Gasoline prices continued their upward  
trend in the past two weeks, spurred by high crude oil prices and a 
continuing demand from summer drivers, according to an industry 
analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	The national weighted average on Friday, including all grades  
and taxes, was $1.31, up 2.51 cents from the previous survey Aug. 
6, Trilby Lundberg, who publishes the Lundberg Survey of 10,000 gas 
stations nationwide, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The price continued a steady upward trend since mid-June,  
Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	The individual price breakdown per gallon is as follows for  
self-service gas: regular gas in the past two weeks cost $1.2561; 
mid-grade cost $1.3550; and premium gas cost $1.4398. 
</P>
<P>
	Full-service gas per gallon was as follows: $1.5816 for regular  
grade; $1.6683 for mid-grade; and $1.7419 for premium gas. 
</P>
<P>
	Lundberg said the upward trend could fade with the summer sun.  
</P>
<P>
	``As the so-called summer driving season ends and gas demand  
slacks off after Labor Day, gasoline price increases will probably 
slow or disappear altogether,'' she said. ``That's if crude oil 
prices don't rise further.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The current price for all grades is 21.5 cents more than this  
time last year, during which prices crashed, Lundberg said. The 
survey for Aug. 21, 1998 showed a national average for all grades 
was $1.0950. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is within one penny of the same time in 1997. The survey  
for Aug. 22, 1997 showed a price average of $1.3184.

<HEADLINE> Rio Grande Valley Ready for Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAYMONDVILLE, Texas (AP) -- Lupe Fuentes knew his trailer home  
wasn't safe with winds above 100 mph on the way. Still, he was 
reluctant to move. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever something like this goes around, everybody wants to  
break in,'' said Fuentes, who once had his air conditioning unit 
stolen from his window. 
</P>
<P>
	He opted to take a bus to higher ground, but many other  
Raymondville residents hunkered down and waited for Hurricane Bret, 
which was headed in their direction Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Police expected up to 8 inches of rain, but hoped the drainage  
system in this city about 20 miles west of the southeast Texas 
coast could handle it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have everything under control,'' said co-police Chief Alex  
Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	He said during Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, water was chest-high  
and police evacuated people on boats. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were catching trout over here,'' police investigator Uvaldo  
Zamora said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuentes was at the Raymondville community center where people  
gathered to evacuate to the upper Rio Grande Valley. The first bus 
that took off Sunday afternoon only had about 13 people aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	In downtown Raymondville, people worked furiously to protect  
store windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Before leaving his home, Fuentes boarded up his windows. But he  
didn't know if his home, sitting on blocks, would survive.

<HEADLINE> Ford To Begin Separate SUV Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co.'s expanding line of sport  
utility vehicles will get its own advertising campaign in the fall 
with an outdoors-adventure theme. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign, which begins with the start of the 2000 model year  
Oct. 1, will use the tagline ``no boundaries.'' Each ad will focus 
on outdoor activities in which Ford SUVs can be used. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford recently began selling its newest SUV, the Excursion, the  
largest on the market. It also plans to introduce the Explorer 
Sport Trac and F-150 SuperCrew -- two SUV-pickup combos -- early next 
year. A small SUV, tentatively called the Escape, debuts later in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The new entries join the popular Explorer and Expedition SUVs.  
</P>
<P>
	The campaign will be linked with special SUV displays at most  
Ford dealerships. The displays will have an outfitter theme and 
show the kind of gear SUVs can carry, such as bicycles, kayaks and 
camping equipment. Buyers will get a catalog of SUV accessories, 
which will also be displayed in the showrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``It allows us to differentiate the Ford showroom from the other  
volume brands in the marketplace,'' said brand manager J.C. 
Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	The approach is similar to that used by lower-volume SUV  
retailer Land Rover North America Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford also will have a ``no boundaries'' site on the World Wide  
Web and sponsor outdoors events, such as ski races and the World 
Outside Festival with Outside Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign will initially include television, print and  
billboard ads. Radio will be added later. 
</P>
<P>
	Actor John Corbett will narrate the TV ads, which were created  
by the J. Walter Thompson agency. Corbett, a regular in the late TV 
series ``Northern Exposure,'' has appeared in a series of ``story 
ads'' for Ford vehicles since early last year. 
</P>
<P>
	By lumping all of Ford's SUVs in one ad campaign, the No. 2  
automaker expects to get more out of its advertising dollars at a 
time when it's undertaking a big campaign to launch its new Focus 
line of subcompacts. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the number of launches that we have, we felt it was the  
most efficient and effective way to show the complete lineup that 
we have,'' Collins said Friday.

<HEADLINE> Crash With Tracy Angers Andretti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CICERO, Ill. (AP) -- Paul Tracy is auto racing's version of the  
obnoxious driver who hangs on others' bumpers and takes paint chips 
with him when he blows by. 
</P>
<P>
	He was at it again Sunday. And just like last year, Michael  
Andretti got tangled up in the mess. 
</P>
<P>
	Tracy knocked himself and Andretti out of the Target Grand Prix  
when he bumped Andretti and sent them both into a wall as they 
battled for third place. The crash left Andretti lightheaded -- and 
then livid. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't understand what Tracy was thinking,'' Andretti said.  
``He put me in an impossible position. He was swerving toward me 
beginning down the straightaway. He could have hurt me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Tracy has won once this year and is fourth in the points  
standings, his career has been tainted by his history of aggressive 
-- some say reckless -- driving. His nickname on the circuit is 
``Captain Crunch.'' Team Kool Green owner Barry Green had to tell 
him and teammate Dario Franchitti to knock it off after they had a 
series of bumps last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Tracy already had spent six races on probation last season  
before colliding with Andretti in Australia. After citing Tracy for 
blocking, risk and unsportsmanlike conduct, CART chief steward 
Wally Dallenbach made the unprecedented move of suspending Tracy 
for this season's opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``Paul Tracy did his normal driving out there,'' Andretti said.  
``He doesn't think, obviously. It's such a shame. He took both of 
us out of the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Tracy insisted the crash wasn't his fault. It was Andretti  
who wouldn't move out of the way when he tried to pass. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough to pass. A guy's got to let you go through,'' Tracy  
said. ``I got up beside him. He's got to let me by. If he doesn't 
back off, we're going to make contact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andretti and Tracy had just taken the green for the 99th lap and  
were heading into turn three when Tracy pulled up alongside 
Andretti to pass him. Etiquette calls for the slower driver to back 
off; Andretti didn't, but Tracy didn't appear to be that far ahead, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
	Tracy continued sliding over and down, finally bumping Andretti.  
Both cars spun hard into the wall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was watching him coming toward me. I'm going like, `Please,  
no, no -- BOOM!''' said Andretti, who was taken off the track in an 
ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
	Andretti doesn't plan to talk to Tracy about the incident, but  
he will talk to Dallenbach. 
</P>
<P>
	He's not the only one. Race winner Juan Montoya and runner-up  
Dario Franchitti accused P.J. Jones of blocking traffic, a 
complaint that's been made before this season. And third-place 
finisher Jimmy Vasser said Robby Gordon wouldn't move despite 
several blue flags that are supposed to signal a driver to let a 
faster car pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallenbach left the track shortly after the race and could not  
be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talk about lap traffic all the time. Guys are supposed to  
give a little when they see that blue flag,'' Vasser said. ``I 
don't understand why these things are not being done. I don't 
understand why black flags are not being thrown.''

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices Continue Upward Trend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) -- Gasoline prices continued their upward  
trend in the past two weeks, spurred by high crude oil prices and a 
continuing demand from summer drivers, according to an industry 
analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	The national weighted average on Friday, including all grades  
and taxes, was $1.31, up 2.51 cents from the previous survey Aug. 
6, Trilby Lundberg, who publishes the Lundberg Survey of 10,000 gas 
stations nationwide, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The price continued a steady upward trend since mid-June,  
Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	The individual price breakdown per gallon is as follows for  
self-service gas: regular gas in the past two weeks cost $1.2561; 
mid-grade cost $1.3550; and premium gas cost $1.4398. 
</P>
<P>
	Full-service gas per gallon was as follows: $1.5816 for regular  
grade; $1.6683 for mid-grade; and $1.7419 for premium gas. 
</P>
<P>
	Lundberg said the upward trend could fade with the summer sun.  
</P>
<P>
	``As the so-called summer driving season ends and gas demand  
slacks off after Labor Day, gasoline price increases will probably 
slow or disappear altogether,'' she said. ``That's if crude oil 
prices don't rise further.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The current price for all grades is 21.5 cents more than this  
time last year, during which prices crashed, Lundberg said. The 
survey for Aug. 21, 1998 showed a national average for all grades 
was $1.0950. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is within one penny of the same time in 1997. The survey  
for Aug. 22, 1997 showed a price average of $1.3184.

<HEADLINE> Burgoff Doing Series of Paintings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEPIN, Wis. (AP) -- He may be known by a TV-watching nation as  
Radar O'Reilly, but Gary Burgoff wants people to take notice of 
some of his other work, including a series of wildlife paintings. 
</P>
<P>
	The 56-year-old Burghoff is doing a series of paintings  
depicting an animal from every state that is making a comeback 
after being on the endangered list. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am hoping to make the statement we can overcome,'' said  
Burghoff, an Emmy Award-winning actor, best known as Corp. Walter 
``Radar'' O'Reilly on TV's ``M A S H'' from 1972 to 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of his paintings completed so far include ``Nevada  
Rising,'' a scene of Canada geese in Nevada; ``California Gold,'' 
which depicts a cougar and cub that moved into a deserted gold 
mine; and ``Connecticut Harlequin,'' which shows a Connecticut wild 
turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	Burghoff's original paintings have sold for $25,000.  
Limited-edition prints usually run in the $280 to $800 range. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Bristol, Conn., native, who began to paint in high  
school, life is about following one's interests -- enthusiastically. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you ignore your passions, you're ignoring your life,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Fleeing Bret, Evacuees Clog Roads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Pushed west by the steady advance of  
Hurricane Bret, evacuees clogged the roads running inland from the 
coast. Cars brimmed with children, pets and bundles of family 
photographs. 
</P>
<P>
	By Sunday afternoon, about 1,000 people had taken their places  
in makeshift shelters hastily set up in San Antonio schools. 
</P>
<P>
	And those were just the public shelters.  
</P>
<P>
	Kelly Air Force Base opened up its empty barracks to 5,000 more  
people forced out of Corpus Christi Naval Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force workers pitched air-conditioned tents outside the  
barracks to house family pets. Husbands and wives were separated 
into men's and women's bunk houses. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a very few ruffled tempers, frayed nerves, because  
of the situation,'' petty officer Matt Sainopulos said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dark clouds brooded over the city while droves of displaced  
families arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of mentally handicapped people were packed into vans  
and driven from the Corpus Christi State School. The clients will 
be housed in San Antonio facilities until the skies clear. 
</P>
<P>
	``We try to treat it as kind of an excursion or an adventure to  
try to allay their fears,'' said Laurie Lentz, a spokeswoman for 
the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation. 
</P>
<P>
	In a San Antonio middle school cafeteria, adults hunched over  
dominoes while children raced in circles as Sunday slowly drained 
into night. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost 200 families were staying in that Red Cross shelter,  
spokesman Emilio Nicolas Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the families brought their own pillows and blankets,  
Nicolas said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't need to, but it makes them feel better,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Hubbard Levell, 72, reached a Victoria shelter early Sunday  
morning. Levell, his son and two granddaughters fled his trailer 
home in Port Lavaca. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they said 'evacuate,' I said, 'My God, we'd better get  
out of here,' '' Levell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nora Webb of Corpus Christi said she planned to watch television  
weather reports all night at a shelter at the John Jay High School 
cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
	She and nine members of her family packed into two cars and  
drove more than five hours to San Antonio, which normally is a 
two-hour trek. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just don't know what to expect,'' Ms. Webb said. ``My dad  
and my brother stayed over and I'm a little worried.''

<HEADLINE> Compaq Abandons Alpha Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Compaq Computer Corp. has abandoned efforts to  
make its advanced Alpha computer chips compatible with 32-bit 
Windows 2000, the next version of Microsoft Inc.'s NT operating 
system due out later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston-based Compaq said it has disbanded the 100-person team  
assigned to the project, and some layoffs are likely. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision in no way diminishes our commitment to Microsoft  
or Alpha,'' he said. ``Alpha is the development platform for 64-bit 
Windows NT.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company continues to work with Microsoft to develop 64-bit  
Windows NT, Compaq spokesman Jim Finlaw said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Alpha chip has been consistently faster than the competing  
Pentium chip because it's built to handle 64 bits of data at a 
time, compared to 32 bits for Pentium, The Boston Globe reported 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Alpha's 64-bit design won't run on Window's 32-bit operating  
system, including NT, without a translation program, the newspaper 
said. This translation causes Alpha to run slower, eliminating its 
advantage over Pentium. The operating system is what runs the 
computer's basic functions. 
</P>
<P>
	Finlaw said he could not confirm such a slowdown, but said the  
decision was based on customer demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not plan to support 32-bit Windows 2000 on Alpha systems  
because we're getting the power and performance customers need ... 
with 32-bit Windows NT on the Intel platform,'' he said. ``We've 
got to go where the volume is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, he said, Compaq will focus on selling its Alpha-based  
machines with Linux and Unix operating systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Unix is widely used for high-end corporate computing because  
it's considered more reliable than Windows NT. Linux produces a 
64-bit version of its operating system for Alpha users that is 
available at low cost. 
</P>
<P>
	The Alpha chip was developed in the early 1990s by engineers at  
Maynard-based Digital Equipment Corp., which was acquired by Compaq 
in 1998. The alpha chip, which Compaq helps design, is manufactured 
by Intel and Samsung, among others, Finlaw said.

<HEADLINE>  Clintons Focus on Senate Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- President Clinton and his wife, Hillary,  
concentrated Sunday on the very un-vacation-like duty of raising 
money for her possible Senate campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	About 250 guests walked up a gravel drive to the home of Viacom  
executive Frank Biondi and his wife, Carol, in the Katama section 
of Edgartown to pledge support if Mrs. Clinton finally decides to 
run for the U.S. Senate from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a fourth consecutive day of social activity for Clinton,  
who ventured out alone Saturday night to dinner at a friend's home. 
He planned dinner with friends again Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons often attend church while on Martha's Vineyard, but  
skipped services Sunday in anticipation of the late morning brunch, 
which raised $1,000 per ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady's fund-raiser was closed to the press, and with  
their watchful eyes out of the room, the president picked up a 
spare saxophone and joined Resonance, a high school jazz band 
providing the entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	He belted out a jazzy ``My Funny Valentine'' to honor an  
unidentified couple celebrating their 35th wedding anniversary. He 
did not speak to the crowd -- unlike at his first fund-raiser for 
his wife Friday night, when he talked sweetly of their meeting in 
law school and his feeble attempts to avoid falling in love with 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is her event,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.  
``He's just here to attend and see some friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The guest list included a few of the Clintons' posse of Vineyard  
friends: Vernon Jordan, Steven Rattner, Dick Ebersol, Maurice 
Tempelsman. Also attending were humor columnist Art Buchwald, 
lawyer Alan Dershowitz, and Mrs. Clinton's former spokeswoman, Lisa 
Caputo. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, the Clintons journeyed to a restaurant in nearby Oak  
Bluffs to a birthday celebration for longtime aide Kelly Craighead. 
Cheers erupted from a gaggle of onlookers as Clinton emerged from 
his bronze sport utility vehicle. He waved and strode over to shake 
hands with a few people in the doorway of the Vineyard Sanctum 
health store. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Schilling, 35, owner of the C'est La Vie shop nearby,  
handed Clinton a bag containing a polo shirt and a hat from his 
store. ``This is for you, sir,'' Schilling said in a mild French 
accent. Then he pumped his fist and said ``All right! I did it!'' 
He said he'd waited a long time to give the president a gift from 
his store. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a pleasure to have him here on the island,'' Schilling  
said. ``Cool, cool, cool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton shook hands among the crowd that built up while he was  
at the birthday celebration. Mrs. Clinton emerged from the 
restaurant just as he finished pressing the flesh. She shook a few 
hands before their motorcade sped back to the vacation compound. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Lockhart said Clinton was being briefed Sunday on the  
Federal Emergency Management Agency's preparations for Hurricane 
Bret's landfall in Texas. FEMA Director James Lee Witt briefed the 
president on the situation Saturday.

<HEADLINE> McCain Downplays Skipping Straw Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate John McCain  
said Sunday that skipping Iowa's straw poll would not hurt his 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was the wisest non-investment of time and energy  
that I've ever made in my political career,'' McCain said during a 
campaign stop here. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona senator skipped Iowa's Aug. 14 straw poll, which was  
won handily by Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the GOP frontrunner. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain and others have criticized the event as an example of  
vote-buying because candidates paid the $25-a-head cost for people 
to cast ballots. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he said he decided to focus his time and money on  
campaigning in New Hampshire, another important presidential 
primary state. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said most Americans currently aren't interested in the  
presidential race, but that he expects they will tune in by late 
fall. Until then, he said he plans to take specific stands on 
issues and raise money so voters will know where he stands.

<HEADLINE> Sheen To Star in Showtime Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Charlie Sheen is taking on the role of a  
pornography king riddled with drug and alcohol addictions, problems 
that mirror the actor's real-life struggles. 
</P>
<P>
	Time magazine reports in its Monday issue that Sheen and brother  
Emilio Estevez are slated to play siblings in Showtime's upcoming 
cable film, ``Rated X.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Estevez is directing the project, which chronicles the careers  
of pornography pioneers Artie and Jim Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheen plays the doomed sibling ultimately killed by Estevez's  
character after the latter becomes fed up with his brother's drug 
and alcohol abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	In reality, Sheen has suffered a string of legal troubles  
related to substance abuse and has spent time as an inpatient for 
detoxification. 
</P>
<P>
	``Charlie had to go down some very dark roads. I realized it  
could be dangerous,'' Estevez said of the film. ``In fact, it was 
cathartic. He's brilliant.''

<HEADLINE> NFL Camps Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Scott Zolak was one of Bill Parcells' favorite players in New  
England, but the Jets coach had little patience with the reserve 
quarterback and waived him on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The move came two days after Parcells traded a conditional draft  
pick to Green Bay for Rick Mirer. 
</P>
<P>
	Zolak, a nine-year veteran in his first year with the Jets,  
played poorly in Friday's 10-9 exhibition win over the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a better opportunity for him to let him go now,''  
Parcells said of Zolak, 10-of-22 for 90 yards against Philadelphia. 
The former Patriots backup had signed a one-year, $400,000 deal 
with the Jets in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Mirer, a former first-round draft pick of the Seahawks, is with  
his fourth team in as many years. Parcells passed on Mirer, who is 
expected to make his Jets' debut Saturday against the Giants, in 
favor of Drew Bledsoe in the 1993 draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Mirer hasn't taken a regular season snap since 1997, when he  
started three games for the Bears. 
</P>
<P>
	``First of all, he has fairly good movement,'' Parcells said of  
Mirer. ``He can move around a little bit. I think at this stage 
he's been exposed -- this is his fourth pro system -- and he's going 
to have a good idea what's going on from a football standpoint. I 
know he's a good worker, a good preparer, those kinds of things.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             *Bengals    	
</P>
<P>
	Safety Kelvin Moore was in stable condition at a hospital in  
Pontiac, Mich., two days after he broke a vertebra in his neck 
while making a tackle in an exhibition game against the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore has feeling in his arms and legs and is expected to make  
``an excellent recovery,'' team Dr. Robert Heidt Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
	After watching film of the play, coach Bruce Coslet said Moore  
did everything right and still got hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked like he was a little bit stumbling into him and just  
bent his head back,'' Coslet said. ``It just happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             *Panthers    	
</P>
<P>
	Two days after getting solid performances from Steve Beuerlein,  
Jeff Lewis and Dameyune Craig, first-year Panthers coach George 
Seifert wasn't interested in talking about the status of the three 
quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to reveal whether incumbent starter Beuerlein would  
work with the first-team offense in the Panthers' next exhibition 
Friday night in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like we've arrived and we've got all this exotic Pro  
Bowl-caliber depth now,'' he said. ``We're just kind of giving them 
an opportunity to show us what they've got, and it was good. They 
took advantage of their shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
                              *Giants    	
</P>
<P>
	The hamstring injury that cornerback Jason Sehorn sustained a  
week before training camp continues to heal slowly and he will miss 
another week or two, according to coach Jim Fassel. 
</P>
<P>
	Sehorn had an MRI on Friday and doctors decided not to let him  
run this week, Fassel said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although he is just striding and things, they just want to  
make sure he completely rests it,'' Fassel said. ``So we are going 
to take him off the running.'' 
</P>
<P>
                              *Bills    	
</P>
<P>
	Backup nose tackle Pat Williams craves playing time, but this  
time the Bills gave him more than he asked for. 
</P>
<P>
	All-Pro Ted Washington stayed home after a house fire and  
Williams had four tackles in the Bills' 20-19 exhibition loss to 
the Redskins on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was on the field for about all but 10 of the Redskins'  
74 plays. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Patriots    	
</P>
<P>
	When Terry Glenn is healthy, New England's offense is one of the  
best in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	After setting a rookie record with 90 receptions, Glenn has been  
hampered by injuries. Last year, the receiver missed four games 
with a pulled hamstring. He returned for the next three before 
breaking his ankle against the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	But Glenn had five receptions for 85 yards and a touchdown in  
New England's 34-14 victory over Dallas on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Dolphins    	
</P>
<P>
	Miami's biggest goal in training camp was to upgrade an offense  
that ranked 16th in the NFL last year. Midway through the 
exhibition schedule, there's scant evidence of progress. 
</P>
<P>
	The first team failed to produce a first down in the exhibition  
opener against New Orleans, and in Saturday night's 13-10 victory 
at San Diego, Miami managed just one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Colts    	
</P>
<P>
	It didn't take long for Edgerrin James to make an impact for  
Indianapolis. The rookie, playing in the first half, rushed for 77 
yards on 10 carries and scored on runs of 16 yards and 12 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Edgerrin really showed why we picked him so high,'' Colts  
coach Jim Mora said. ``He gave us a spark and showed what he can 
do. He looks like the real deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts took James as the fourth overall draft pick, one spot  
ahead of New Orleans who took Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams.

<HEADLINE> Mutiny 2, Crew 1, SO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Pete Marino, Josh Keller and Steve Ralston  
scored in the shootout as the Tampa Bay Mutiny defeated the 
Columbus Crew 2-1 Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second shooutout victory for Tampa Bay in Columbus  
this year. The Mutiny won 1-0 at Crew Stadium on May 22. The Crew 
won the only game between the two in Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory gave the Mutiny (11-14) sole possession of third  
place in the MLS' Eastern Conference. The Crew (15-9) remained in 
second. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian McBride of Columbus opened the scoring in the 38th minute  
with his first goal since April 3. Robert Warzycha sent a pass to 
McBride, who got a shot off his right foot and inside the right 
post past Mutiny goalkeeper Scott Garlick. 
</P>
<P>
	Raul Diaz Arce tied the score with a penalty kick in the 64th  
minute after Marino was hauled down by Warzycha. 
</P>
<P>
	McBride missed the Crew's first attempt in the shootout and  
teammate Stern John scored, but the goal came after time had 
expired. Garlick then saved a shot by Billy Thompson to clinch the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Crew led 17-14 in total shots and 6-3 in shots on goal.  
Garlick had five saves, while Crew goalkeeper Mark Dougherty 
stopped two shots.

<HEADLINE> GM Going Ahead With Thai Auto Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- When U.S. auto giant General Motors  
unveiled plans to build its Southeast Asian production center in 
Thailand less than three years ago, the sky seemed the limit for 
the regional car industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Asian economies were booming and the demand for swanky sedans  
was growing. Nothing looked like it could get in the way for 
another prize foreign investment deal for tigerish Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the financial crisis in 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	GM's plans to produce 100,000 vehicles a year at a $640 million  
new plant on Thailand's eastern seaboard were dashed, as the 
regional motor market plunged even faster than Asian currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the Thai economy showing some signs of recovery, GM is  
pressing ahead, albeit on a vastly smaller scale than first 
envisioned. The first vehicles are set to roll off the production 
line in May 2000, 16 months behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first the capacity was going to be 100,000 units per year,  
but due to the economic crisis, we scaled that down to 40,000 per 
year,'' Kantanit Sukontasap, vice-president for corporate affairs 
at GM (Thailand), told The Associated Press in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
	And fittingly enough, instead of churning out grand four-door  
sedans as everyone expected, the Thai plant will become GM's second 
factory for the more humble mini multipurpose vehicle, the Zafira. 
</P>
<P>
	Following its European launch in April, the middle-priced  
minivan has proved popular, with GM's plant in Germany unable to 
fill orders that have so far totaled over 40,000 units, Kantanit 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-seater model is set to retail at between $16,200 and  
$21,600, which GM hopes will undercut imported competition. 
</P>
<P>
	But only 15 percent of production from the Thai plant will be  
for the local market, with the rest destined for export to various 
parts of the world. 
</P>
<P>
	GM will be pushing very hard to sell the Zafira in Asia to  
expand its meager share of the Japanese-dominated market from less 
than 1 percent at the moment to some 10 percent within three years, 
Kantanit said. 
</P>
<P>
	He is hopeful that if the vehicle proves a success in the  
region, GM would expand its production in Thailand, to reach an 
annual capacity of 100,000 vehicles, as originally intended. 
</P>
<P>
	While the economic jury is still out on Thailand's prospects of  
sustained recovery, the U.S. firm, which has already invested $500 
million on the plant at Rayong, insists it is upbeat about the 
country's prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why we are here and will be here for the long-term,''  
Kantanit said. ``We believe that the Thai economy will start to 
really take off next year and that will coincide with our start of 
commercial operations midyear 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plant is set for completion by 1999.

<HEADLINE> Wounds Remain 10 Yrs. After Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The night held the air of youthful promise as  
16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins and his three friends embarked on a 
typical teen-age rite of passage: looking for a used car. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, it ended in violence when about 30 club-wielding white  
youths -- one with a gun -- confronted the blacks, mistakenly 
thinking they were coming to the largely white neighborhood for a 
party being thrown by one attacker's ex-girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	Shots rang out and Hawkins lay wounded on a street in the  
Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn. With his death that night on Aug. 
23, 1989, the city's oft-mended and fragile cloth of racial 
civility was torn wide open. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Howard Beach was the chip in the wall, Bensonhurst probably  
was the sledge hammer that knocked the wall down,'' said the Rev. 
Al Sharpton, referring to the fatal beating of a black man by 
another white mob in the borough of Queens three years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight people were tried for the attack. Three went to prison;  
two others were convicted but given probation; three were 
acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the gunman, Joey Fama, remains jailed. Convicted of  
second-degree murder, he is not scheduled for parole until 2022. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters who came to the neighborhood after the killing were  
met by residents shouting racial slurs. Some chanted ``useless, 
useless,'' a play on the slain Hawkins' first name. One spectator 
spat in the face of the victim's father, Moses Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you know how that felt to hear those people shouting  
'useless, useless'? It nearly tore my heart out,'' said Stewart, 
who still blames the neighborhood for silently supporting his son's 
attackers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bensonhurst, once a stronghold for Italian immigrants, now has a  
much more diverse flavor. Chinese, Korean and Russian stores dot a 
main drag, and hundreds of Mexican immigrants gather each morning, 
hoping to get day jobs in construction and gardening. 
</P>
<P>
	At St. Dominic's Roman Catholic Church, the Rev. Italo Barozzi  
said the neighborhood would rather forget the incident and the 
dozens of marches it set off. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was shocking to the people. They don't expect that here,''  
Barozzi said. ``But all those marches? We must solve problems in a 
better way. What, after all, is the importance of a march? What are 
you protesting?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the killing spurred political change.  
</P>
<P>
	It helped create an activist movement that was recently revived  
with the police killing of unarmed black immigrant Amadou Diallo in 
a hail of 41 bullets. It also catapulted Manhattan Borough 
President David Dinkins to victory in that year's Democratic 
mayoral primary. He became the city's first black mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	``David Dinkins walked into City Hall over the body of Yusuf  
Hawkins,'' said Hawkins' father, his voice tinged with both pride 
and sadness. 
</P>
<P>
	The night of the slaying began innocently enough. Hawkins and  
three friends went by subway to Bensonhurst to look at a used 1983 
Pontiac. After stopping to buy candy, they were suddenly surrounded 
near the house of Gina Feliciano, who had angered a neighborhood 
youth, Keith Mondello, by asking some black and Latino teen-agers 
to a party. 
</P>
<P>
	Mondello had vowed to keep minorities out of the neighborhood.  
He and the others had spent the day drinking beer and smoking 
marijuana, then gathered up baseball bats, golf clubs and sticks. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart said his son and the others never understood what was  
happening. Shots rang out and Hawkins fell, still clutching a candy 
bar. None of the other black teens was seriously hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Thinking back on that night, Stewart remembers the new pants,  
shirt and shoes he had bought his son -- a B-plus student with 
dreams of being an engineer. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I came back from the hospital after seeing my son lying  
so still, like he was sleeping, I saw the clothes hanging in the 
closet,'' Stewart said. ``I was waiting for him to come home to 
give them to him, but he never came home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Mondello asked Stewart's forgiveness after serving  
eight years in prison. But Stewart said the meeting could not mend 
his hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a nice gesture, but I told him up front that I am in no  
position to offer forgiveness -- that's God's job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mondello, now a college student, could not be reached for his  
thoughts on the case. Stewart, a former truck driver who now works 
with Sharpton fighting bias, said the killing changed his life. 
</P>
<P>
	His relationship with his longtime sweetheart, Diane Hawkins,  
ended three years after Yusuf's death. Ms. Hawkins has never spoken 
of the shooting. Their younger son, disgusted with New York, has 
moved away; a third son is reclusive. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he has managed to find peace in the decade since the  
slaying, Stewart replied: 
</P>
<P>
	``It depends on what you call peace. Can I sleep at night a  
little better? Yes. Has some of the rage in me calmed? Yes. As far 
as me being peaceful about the racial overtones -- no. I am still 
just as up in arms as the day after my son died.''

<HEADLINE>  Europe Picks Ryder Cup Team  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- Padraig Harrington of Ireland played his  
way onto his first Ryder Cup team Sunday, and captain Mark James 
gave Europe a truly green look by selecting Andrew Coltart as one 
his two captain's picks. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrington finished second behind Colin Montgomerie in the BMW  
International Open and moved up to 10th in the Ryder Cup standings, 
nudging out Robert Karlsson. James then rounded off the team with 
Jesper Parnevik and Coltart, a Scotsman who has never played in the 
matches and who has only one victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coltart has played more consistently since the U.S. Open than  
any of the other candidates,'' James said. ``He's shown the most, 
and he's one of the Top 20 players in the world. It was a very 
difficult choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Nick Faldo and the rest of Europe's old guard watching from  
home for the first time in 24 years, James will bring one of the 
most inexperienced teams over to The Country Club outside Boston 
next month as Europe tries to retain the Ryder Cup once again. 
</P>
<P>
	Faldo, Bernard Langer, Ian Woosnam, Seve Ballesteros and Sandy  
Lyle were regarded as the ``Fab Five'' in Europe -- at least one of 
them as played in every Ryder Cup since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, they have been replaced by a new generation.  
</P>
<P>
	Seven Europeans have never experienced a Ryder Cup -- Coltart,  
Harrington, Sergio Garcia, British Open champion Paul Lawrie, Jean 
Van de Velde, Miguel Angel Jimenez and Jarmo Sandelin. Three others 
-- Parnevik, Lee Westwood and Darren Clarke -- have played in only 
one Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The experience will come from Masters champion Jose Maria  
Olazabal, playing on his fifth team, and Montgomerie, who will be 
on his fourth team. Garcia, the 19-year-old Spaniard who finished 
second in the PGA Championship behind Tiger Woods, is the youngest 
player in Ryder Cup history. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team, which captain Ben Crenshaw completed last week  
after the PGA Championship, has only one rookie -- David Duval. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's an excellent team,'' James said. ``I think it's  
balanced and I think we have a good mix of different types of 
players and personalities. I'm confident we can win, because it 
doesn't matter who was there before. It's the standard of players 
we have this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Europe has won or retained the Ryder Cup five times in the past  
seven matches, although the Americans have been heavily favored 
each time. 
</P>
<P>
	James was thought to be leaning toward experience, but chose  
Coltart over Langer and Woosnam. He had told Faldo, who has played 
on every Ryder Cup team since 1977, that he would not make this 
one. 
</P>
<P>
	``I bumped into Mark in the hotel last night and asked him -- he  
said I was too far down the ladder,'' said a dejected Faldo, who 
had openly campaigned to make the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomerie had hoped Faldo would be included.  
</P>
<P>
	``The team that plays in Brookline will be weaker without  
Nick,'' Montgomerie said. ``I would pick him, yes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomerie closed with a 70 for a 20-under 268 to win the BMW  
International by three strokes over Harrington, who shot a 72. 
Harrington needed to finish in the top two to make the Ryder Cup 
team, and made a 9-foot putt on the last hole to finish a stroke 
ahead of Jarrod Mosely for second. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll sink in tomorrow what I've done,'' said an overjoyed  
Harrington. ``I won't sleep tonight -- I didn't sleep yesterday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Europe's 12 players are all expected to be at Firestone Country  
Club in Akron, Ohio, this week for the $5 million NEC Invitational, 
a World Golf Championship event for players on the Ryder Cup and 
Presidents Cup teams.

<P>
	Harrington finished second behind Colin Montgomerie in the BMW  
International Open and moved up to 10th in the Ryder Cup standings, 
nudging out Robert Karlsson. James then rounded off the team with 
Jesper Parnevik and Coltart, a Scotsman who has never played in the 
matches and who has only one victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coltart has played more consistently since the U.S. Open than  
any of the other candidates,'' James said. ``He's shown the most, 
and he's one of the Top 20 players in the world. It was a very 
difficult choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Nick Faldo and the rest of Europe's old guard watching from  
home for the first time in 24 years, James will bring one of the 
most inexperienced teams over to The Country Club outside Boston 
next month as Europe tries to retain the Ryder Cup once again. 
</P>
<P>
	Faldo, Bernard Langer, Ian Woosnam, Seve Ballesteros and Sandy  
Lyle were regarded as the ``Fab Five'' in Europe -- at least one of 
them as played in every Ryder Cup since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, they have been replaced by a new generation.  
</P>
<P>
	Seven Europeans have never experienced a Ryder Cup -- Coltart,  
Harrington, Sergio Garcia, British Open champion Paul Lawrie, Jean 
Van de Velde, Miguel Angel Jimenez and Jarmo Sandelin. Three others 
-- Parnevik, Lee Westwood and Darren Clarke -- have played in only 
one Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The experience will come from Masters champion Jose Maria  
Olazabal, playing on his fifth team, and Montgomerie, who will be 
on his fourth team. Garcia, the 19-year-old Spaniard who finished 
second in the PGA Championship behind Tiger Woods, is the youngest 
player in Ryder Cup history. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team, which captain Ben Crenshaw completed last week  
after the PGA Championship, has only one rookie -- David Duval. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's an excellent team,'' James said. ``I think it's  
balanced and I think we have a good mix of different types of 
players and personalities. I'm confident we can win, because it 
doesn't matter who was there before. It's the standard of players 
we have this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Europe has won or retained the Ryder Cup five times in the past  
seven matches, although the Americans have been heavily favored 
each time. 
</P>
<P>
	James was thought to be leaning toward experience, but chose  
Coltart over Langer and Woosnam. He had told Faldo, who has played 
on every Ryder Cup team since 1977, that he would not make this 
one. 
</P>
<P>
	``I bumped into Mark in the hotel last night and asked him -- he  
said I was too far down the ladder,'' said a dejected Faldo, who 
had openly campaigned to make the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomerie had hoped Faldo would be included.  
</P>
<P>
	``The team that plays in Brookline will be weaker without  
Nick,'' Montgomerie said. ``I would pick him, yes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomerie closed with a 70 for a 20-under 268 to win the BMW  
International by three strokes over Harrington, who shot a 72. 
Harrington needed to finish in the top two to make the Ryder Cup 
team, and made a 9-foot putt on the last hole to finish a stroke 
ahead of Jarrod Mosely for second. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll sink in tomorrow what I've done,'' said an overjoyed  
Harrington. ``I won't sleep tonight -- I didn't sleep yesterday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Europe's 12 players are all expected to be at Firestone Country  
Club in Akron, Ohio, this week for the $5 million NEC Invitational, 
a World Golf Championship event for players on the Ryder Cup and 
Presidents Cup teams.

<TEXT>
<P>
	CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) -- Sheets of rain and winds over 100  
mph buffeted the Texas Gulf Coast on Sunday as Hurricane Bret 
neared landfall, forcing thousands of people to flee inland. 
</P>
<P>
	Businesses and homes were shuttered from Brownsville to north of  
Corpus Christi, and highways leading inland were packed with 
bumper-to-bumper traffic for miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The slowly moving, tightly focused storm had the ``clear  
potential of producing major disaster,'' said Jim Hoke, director of 
the National Weather Service's National Hydrometeorological 
Emergency Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm was within 10 miles of Padre Island by 6 p.m EDT.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to be bad,'' 19-year-old Elissa Rivera said  
as she stopped for a quick picnic lunch on her trip to San Antonio, 
where the Red Cross set up shelters for evacuees. ``We have a 
townhome and we're more worried about flooding than anything. We 
had to take everything and move it upstairs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Winds of 140 mph, with gusts even higher, extended 40 miles out  
from the storm. The storm's eye was about 80 miles south-southeast 
of Corpus Christi and appeared headed ashore in sparsely populated 
Kenedy County. 
</P>
<P>
	Palm trees whipped as the wind strengthened in early afternoon  
and Corpus Christi Bay was covered with whitecaps. 
</P>
<P>
	Corpus Christi declared a state of disaster and called for a  
general but voluntary evacuation of the city of 300,000 residents, 
said city spokesman Ted Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are really trying to drive home the point that we take this  
very seriously and we consider this a very serious storm,'' Nelson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The evacuation was ``proceeding in an orderly fashion,'' Corpus  
Christi City Manager David Garcia said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The core of the Category 4 storm was expected to make landfall  
during the late afternoon or early evening, the National Weather 
Service said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope my fellow Texans say a prayer for those fellow Texans  
that are in harm's way,'' Gov. George W. Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Like monstrous Hurricane Allen in 1980, Bret's center appeared  
headed for one of the state's least populated areas, the ranch land 
of Kleberg and Kenedy counties between Brownsville and Corpus 
Christi. However, tropical storm-force winds of up to 73 mph 
extended more than 100 miles outward from the center, the National 
Hurricane Center said. 
</P>
<P>
	The King Ranch occupies much of Kenedy and Kleberg counties.  
Ranch president Jack Hunt said about 50 people had been evacuated 
but there was no way to protect about 55,000 head of cattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cattle will just have to ride it out,'' Hunt said. ``It's  
not practical to move them out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waves reached 26 feet high late in the morning at a buoy 45  
miles off the coast, the weather service said, and tidal surges of 
10 to 15 feet were possible when the storm hit the coast. Up to a 
foot of rain could fall on coastal areas and there was also a 
threat of tornadoes, the weather service warned. 
</P>
<P>
	Most residents had left coastal Padre and Mustang islands, where  
a mandatory order was issued and police went door-to-door urging 
people to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong Lumber in Corpus Christi opened at 6:30 a.m. to give  
customers a last chance to buy plywood, tape and other supplies, 
owner Bob Litchfield said. But as the weather worsened, Litchfield 
locked the doors shortly before noon and sent his employees home. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to board up ourselves,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane warnings were posted from La Pesca, Mexico, north to  
Port O'Connor, Texas. A tropical storm warning and hurricane watch 
was discontinued from Port O'Connor to Freeport, about 35 miles 
southwest of Galveston. 
</P>
<P>
	At 6 p.m. EDT, Bret was centered over Padre Island, about 70  
miles south of Corpus Christi, the National Weather Service said. 
After heading northward during the night, the hurricane turned 
slowly on Sunday and by early afternoon was moving toward the 
west-northwest at about 8 mph. It was expected to continue in that 
general direction but slow down over the next 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas hadn't been hit by a hurricane since Hurricane Jerry  
killed three people in October 1989. However, the state's 
367-mile-long coast has been struck by tropical storms since then, 
including Charley, which dumped 18 inches of rain and killed 19 
people in August 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm initially had been expected to head for Mexico's  
northern coast. But after Bret turned onto a course toward southern 
Texas, Mexico got little more than strong wind and warm rain, with 
a possibility of minor flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	Far out at sea, Cindy had weakened from a hurricane to a  
tropical storm, with sustained wind of 65 mph. At 4 p.m. EDT, Cindy 
was moving west at about 5 mph and was located about 580 miles west 
of the Cape Verde Islands, off the west coast of Africa, or 2,200 
miles east of San Juan, Puerto Rico.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Trying Rice Waste as Fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OROVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- California's first attempt to turn rice  
stubble and tree trimmings into ethanol resembles a scene from 
``Back to the Future,'' when trash is dumped into Mr. Fusion at one 
end and pure energy comes out the other. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed ``bio-refinery'' will convert thousands of tons of  
rice straw, orchard prunings and other agricultural waste into 
ethanol, a sort of 200-proof moonshine that state air-pollution 
fighters hope will soon replace the unpopular additive MTBE in 
California gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see it as an efficient waste-based ethanol plant that takes  
advantage of low-cost and no-cost materials,'' said Stephen J. 
Gatto, head of Boston-based BC International Corp., which plans to 
start construction next year south of Oroville, 60 miles north of 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice farmers see it as a match made in heaven.  
</P>
<P>
	Blocked by state air regulators from burning their stubble, the  
growers disc the hardy straw back into the ground. That costs $30 
an acre, about a fourth of the growers' profits. 
</P>
<P>
	About 500,000 acres of rice are grown in the Sacramento Valley,  
producing about 1.5 million tons of rice straw. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice growers have hunted for ways to use rice straw since new  
air-quality rules took effect in 1993. House insulation, woven 
furniture and scaffolding were among the uses tried. None worked 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	Growers believe they've found the answer in ethanol.  
</P>
<P>
	``We can get this stuff off the field and at least break even.  
That's all we really want to do with the rice stubble -- break 
even,'' said Ken Collins, who farms 1,600 acres of rice near Biggs 
and plans to ship his rice straw to the new plant. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oroville factory will convert about 75,000 tons of rice  
straw, 125,000 tons of orchard slash and 40,000 tons of other 
agricultural waste into ethanol each year. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're looking at about 900 tons there,'' Collins said, as his  
workers tended to a two-story-high mound of bailed rice straw 
culled from his fields. Collins is among a group of growers who 
have formed a cooperative to feed the new plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethanol is a familiar product in the Midwest, where factories  
convert corn starch into about 1.6 billion gallons annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Illinois, South Dakota, North Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa and  
Minnesota are among states with ethanol factories, providing a 
market for the states' corn growers and a cleaner mix of fuel for 
states facing EPA air pollution-fighting mandates. 
</P>
<P>
	A bushel of corn produces about 2.5 gallons of ethanol.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're making corn whiskey, is what it amounts to. But ethanol  
is very clean. It clearly is a benefit to air quality, and it does 
add octane,'' said Trevor Guthmiller, executive director of the 
South Dakota-based American Coalition for Ethanol. 
</P>
<P>
	Midwestern ethanol growers see California -- and its more than 20  
million licensed drivers -- as a huge new market. BCI's factory, 
expected to open by 2001, won't produce enough ethanol to replace 
all 540 million gallons of MTBE burned annually in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists generally supported Gov. Gray Davis' March  
decision to phase out MTBE, or methyl tertiary butyl ether, noting 
that MTBE contamination had been reported in lakes and groundwater 
across the state. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner  
said last month the EPA would seek to reduce the use of MTBE, 
citing a threat to drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oxygenated Fuels Association, an Arlington, Va.-based trade  
association representing MTBE producers, said the compound protects 
air quality and will prove costly to replace. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the most cost-effective and cleanest source of octane,''  
said Terry Wigglesworth, the group's executive director. ``Replace 
that with something else that's not proven, and you're going to 
have all kinds of problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ethanol backers say the cost to motorists would be about the  
same in California as with MTBE. In the Midwest, ethanol has had 
little effect on pump prices, Guthmiller said. California's 
gasoline prices already are among the highest in the nation, with 
unleaded regular averaging about $1.50 a gallon recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Gatto said ethanol has uses beyond gasoline, including  
mouthwash, aftershave, perfume and solvents. 
</P>
<P>
	The Midwestern plants derive sugar from corn starch to make the  
ethanol, a relatively simple process. In Brazil, ethanol is made 
using cane sugar. 
</P>
<P>
	BCI's plant, expected to open by 2001, will use new technology  
to separate cellulose from the ``biomass'' -- wood, straw, leaves, 
fruit pits and other items -- and use that sugar to make the 
ethanol. 
</P>
<P>
	The California Energy Commission is studying the use of ethanol  
and other compounds as fuel additives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, the technology is there and it's not that difficult  
to produce ethanol through the conversion process,'' commission 
spokeswoman Claudia Chandler said. ``The question is, `Is it 
economical and is there a market for it?''' 
</P>
<P>
	The BCI operation will produce about 22 million gallons of  
ethanol a year, or roughly 70 to 100 gallons per ton of biomass. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins and others believe it's just a start.  
</P>
<P>
	``We could use all our rice straw and all our orchard prunings,  
and we'd still hardly sustain the demand,'' Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar biomass ethanol plant, also run by BCI, has begun  
operation in Jennings, La. It produces about 22 million gallons 
annually. That plant cost about $90 million, and the Oroville 
facility is expected to cost about the same, Gatto said.

<HEADLINE> Welfare Changes Not Helping Poorest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Welfare reform has driven the poorest families  
deeper into poverty, while slightly raising the incomes of those 
who are a little better off, say researchers who hope to broaden 
the debate over what constitutes success. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest problem, opposing camps agree, is that many families  
leaving welfare are not getting food stamps although they remain 
eligible. In 1995, 88 percent of poor kids received food stamps. By 
last year, it had fallen to 70 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The conventional wisdom here in Washington is that welfare  
reform is an unqualified success because caseload reductions have 
been so dramatic,'' said Wendell Primus, a researcher at the 
liberal-leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, which was 
releasing the report Sunday. Welfare caseloads have been cut nearly 
in half since peaking in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not saying in this report that welfare reform is  
terrible. We're saying we have to bring more balance to what 
welfare reform is all about,'' added Primus, who resigned a top 
post with the Department of Health and Human Services to protest 
President Clinton's signing of the welfare bill three years ago 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Enthusiasts of the reforms argue that, overall, most families  
are better off. 
</P>
<P>
	``More Americans are enjoying the freedom of independence from  
the chains of welfare,'' said a statement from Rep. Bill Archer, 
R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which 
oversaw the reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, even reform backers acknowledge problems. A report from  
the Ways and Means Committee and testimony from the Clinton 
administration earlier this year acknowledged that the poor are 
losing ground, and Sunday's study is the most extensive 
documentation of these suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are people at the bottom who are worse off. We need to  
do something about that,'' said Ron Haskins, staff director for the 
committee's welfare panel, who helped write the welfare law. But he 
argued that more people are better off. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, which used Census and caseload data, examined  
families headed by single women and found their economic situations 
generally improved between 1993 and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	But over the next two years, the poorest 20 percent of these  
families lost an average of $577 per year, with incomes falling to 
$8,047 annually. Typically, these are families that left welfare 
but had not made up lost benefits with wages. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation was particularly bad for the poorest 10 percent,  
who lost an average of $814 per year. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem, both sides explained, is people who are forced off  
the rolls but haven't figured out how to support themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the old days, nobody cared about them. They just stayed on  
welfare forever,'' Haskins said. ``Now, even to stay on welfare you 
need a certain level of competence. There are things you must do. 
If not, they cut your benefits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report also examined families in the next income tier --  
those making between 75 and 112 percent of the poverty line. They 
came out ahead, but only by an average of $110 per year, bringing 
their average income up to $15,857 per year. 
</P>
<P>
	Essentially, these families were able to replace welfare with  
work and come out ahead, if only slightly, but would have fared 
better had they kept the food stamps they were entitled to. They 
lost an average of $530 in stamps between 1995 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Primus suggested that, given the strong economy, they would be  
doing even better. Haskins said the law was designed so people 
would replace welfare with work: ``The system is working exactly 
the way you drew it up on the chalkboard,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton also expressed concern about declining food  
stamp rolls. Speaking at a welfare-to-work conference in Chicago 
this month, he called it ``the only piece of troubling news in this 
whole happy scenario.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the administration has been unable to figure out why the  
rolls are falling, though some suspect families do not know they 
remain eligible for food help when they leave welfare. ``We have to 
work on that,'' Clinton said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The hamstring injury that New York  
Giants cornerback Jason Sehorn sustained a week before training 
camp continues to heal slowly and he will miss another week or two, 
coach Jim Fassel said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sehorn had an MRI on Friday and doctors decided not to let him  
run this week, Fassel said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although he is just striding and things, they just want to  
make sure he completely rests it,'' Fassel said in a conference 
call. ``So we are going to take him off the running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sehorn has spent most of training camp working with trainers  
while the team practiced. This past week, he has been doing agility 
drills, mostly running around cones and jumping side to side over 
prone tackling pads. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he kind of pulled a little scar tissue, which is not  
bad,'' Fassel said. ``But it can give him a sensation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the MRI showed no problems, Fassel said the team is going  
to be cautious with Sehorn, who missed all of last season after 
injuring a knee while returning a kick in an exhibition game 
against the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	At this point, Sehorn has already missed the Giants' first two  
exhibition games. There is no chance he will play this weekend 
against the Jets and only a slim shot he would play in the final 
game at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe he would practice toward the end of that week for that  
one,'' Fassel said. ``Maybe then he can start practicing full time 
for the week of the Tampa game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sehorn was considered one of the best corners in the league  
before his knee injury. Conrad Hamilton stepped in last season and 
played very well, but Hamilton sprained an ankle in a scrimmage two 
weeks ago and he has been sidelined. 
</P>
<P>
	Fassel said Hamilton should be back in time for the season  
opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll start the guy who is most prepared at that time,'' Fassel  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillippi Sparks and Jeremy Lincoln have started at the corners  
in the preseason, but Lincoln struggled in Saturday night's 27-20 
win over Jacksonville.

<HEADLINE> Twist To Miss Hockey Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Former St. Louis Blues forward Tony Twist -- one  
of NHL's top enforcers -- says injuries from a motorcycle accident 
will sideline him for this season and possibly longer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Best-case scenario is for Twist to return to hockey in nine  
months. But he could be out 14 months or more. 
</P>
<P>
	``The knee thing is a lot more serious than I thought at  
first,'' said Twist, who is recuperating at his home in west St. 
Louis County. 
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old left wing was hurt Aug. 9 when his motorcycle  
rammed a car that cut him off in suburban Creve Coeur. The other 
motorist was cited for failure to yield and driving with a revoked 
license. 
</P>
<P>
	Twist had a broken and dislocated pelvis, broken toe and bruised  
left knee. The critical issue was internal bleeding that threatened 
his life, delayed pelvis surgery for nearly four days and pushed a 
detailed knee exam back a week. 
</P>
<P>
	After surgery to insert a plate into the left side of his  
pelvis, Twist had a magnetic resonance imaging test last weekend on 
his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	It showed tears in both the posterior cruciate and lateral  
collateral ligaments. Instead of missing three to five months with 
his pelvis injury, Twist will be out an extra six to nine months. 
</P>
<P>
	Twist's contract with the Blues expired June 30. An unrestricted  
free agent, he was still negotiating with other NHL teams when he 
was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Twist insisted that he will play again after sitting out next  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know where or when, but I'll be back,'' said the  
6-foot-2, 240-pound player.

<HEADLINE> Gates' Foundation Richest in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft founder Bill Gates now has the  
country's richest charitable foundation, the Chronicle of 
Philanthropy reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates and his wife, Melinda, have consolidated their two  
charitable foundations and donated an additional $6 billion to the 
new Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, bringing its total worth to 
$17.1 billion. The couple decided to merge the William H. Gates 
Foundation and the Gates Learning Foundation so they could broaden 
their focus on learning and global health, foundation co-chairwoman 
Patty Stonesifer said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chronicle reports in its Aug. 26 issue that, with the $6  
billion donation, the Seattle-based foundation is significantly 
wealthier than others in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The report names the David and Lucile Packard Foundation as the  
second wealthiest, with assets of $13 billion. The Ford Foundation, 
with $11.4 billion, is third. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gates Foundation isn't the biggest in the world. That title  
currently belongs to the London-based Wellcome Trust, which has 
assets of $19.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Chronicle reports that the Gates Foundation could climb  
to the top of the list if the charity's namesake keeps on giving. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill and Melinda have made a gift of about $5 billion every  
quarter,'' said Stonesifer. While she would not say whether the 
couple plans to make another gift of similar size before year's 
end, she said she expects that the general pattern of giving ``will 
continue.''

<HEADLINE> Burger Baron Karcher Loses Millions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Carl Karcher, the founder of Carl's Jr.,  
reportedly was forced to sell nearly $8 million worth of stock in 
his fast-food empire. 
</P>
<P>
	With this week's selloff, Karcher's stake in Anaheim-based Carl  
Karcher's Enterprises has dropped more than $100 million since last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a rough week,'' Karcher, 82, told the Orange County  
Register for a report published Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Karcher's selloff of 875,000 shares ended his risky strategy of  
accumulating stock in the parent of Carl's Jr. with borrowed money. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, he had about 3.3 million shares worth about $132  
million, said Andrew Puzder, Karcher's personal attorney. On 
Friday, Karcher's remaining 1.5 million shares were worth about 
$13.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Karcher's broker, Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., forced him to sell in  
what is known as a ``margin call.'' Karcher borrowed against his 
stock's value, and when the price fell Merrill demanded the selloff 
to protect its loan. The stock loans now are gone. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Merrill forced Karcher to dump 1.2 million shares at  
an average price of $13.48 a share when CKE's shares fell below 
$16. The latest selloff was triggered below $13. 
</P>
<P>
	CKE's stock is down due to disappointing sales and profits as it  
tries to revive its Hardee's chain, which it purchased in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Jets Terminate Zolak's Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- New York Jets coach Bill Parcells  
terminated the contract of quarterback Scott Zolak on Sunday, 
effectively handing the team's backup job to newly acquired Rick 
Mirer. 
</P>
<P>
	The move came two days after the club obtained Mirer from the  
Packers for a conditional selection in next year's draft. Zolak, a 
nine-year veteran in his first year with the Jets, played poorly in 
Friday's 10-9 preseason win over the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a better opportunity for him to let him go now,''  
Parcells said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zolak went 10-of-22 for 90 yards against Philadelphia. The  
former Patriots backup, who signed a one-year, $400,000 deal with 
the Jets in April, was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Having plenty to say Sunday was Mirer, who admitted to being  
stunned when Green Bay traded him to the Jets. The seventh-year 
player, who was drafted second overall by Seattle in 1993, is with 
his fourth team in the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been dealt a pretty bad hand, and I've tried to do the  
best I could in the position I was in,'' Mirer, 29, said. ``I think 
when you go through hard times, you learn a lot. To survive that 
stuff, I think it helps your character. It's important to keep your 
head up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mirer, signed by the Packers on the eve of the 1998 season,  
hasn't taken a regular season snap since 1997, when he started 
three games for the Bears. The Jets hope to use him in the second 
half Saturday in a preseason showdown with the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	``First of all, he has fairly good movement,'' Parcells said of  
Mirer. ``He can move around a little bit. I think at this stage 
he's been exposed -- this is his fourth pro system -- and he's going 
to have a good idea what's going on from a football standpoint. I 
know he's a good worker, a good preparer, those kinds of things. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to get him in and try him in the short period we  
have, to take a look and see if this is an improvement over what 
I've seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells traded for Mirer after being disappointed with the play  
of Zolak, his former quarterback with the Patriots, and project Ray 
Lucas, a special teams player being groomed to complement starter 
Vinny Testaverde. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief meeting with his newest player Saturday, Parcells  
compared Mirer's career to that of Testaverde, who has enjoyed a 
rebirth with the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the very first things Coach Parcells said to me was  
that my situation prior to being here is not a whole lot unlike 
what Vinny had gone through -- big expectations and kind of being a 
part of teams that weren't doing a lot and were a little 
disappointing,'' Mirer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the stuff I've been through, it would be easy to call  
it quits and just duck away from it,'' he said. ``But I've taken it 
head-on the whole time, gained a lot by being through some of the 
hard stuff, and now I'm waiting for the good stuff to happen and 
look forward to that.''

	Residents Evacuate As Bret Hits  
</P>
<P>
	CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) -- Hurricane Bret, the biggest storm  
to hit Texas in nearly 20 years, roared ashore today with 
horizontal sheets of rain and 125-mph winds that whipped and bent 
palm trees and forced thousands of people to flee inland. The 
rapidly developing storm made landfall about 6 p.m. in sparsely 
populated Kenedy County, about 70 miles south of Corpus Christi. 
Businesses and homes were shuttered from Brownsville to north of 
Corpus Christi, and highways leading inland were packed with 
bumper-to-bumper traffic for miles.

	Many Rescue Crews Frustrated in Turkey

<P>
	IZMIT, Turkey (AP) -- Thousands of rescue and medical crews raced  
to Turkey to help in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake, 
but in the sweeping chaos some relief units were sent to areas 
where there was no need -- while other regions needed more help. At 
the same time, Turkey's officials have been swamped with too much 
aid and saddled with rescue crews that have nothing to do because 
most of the injured have already been treated.

	HONG KONG (AP) -- A China Airlines jet burst into flames, flipped  
upside down and slid down the runway at Hong Kong's new airport 
today while trying to land in a tropical storm, killing two people

setback for the airline, which has struggled in recent years to 
overcome a poor safety record and a reputation for arrogant and 
undisciplined pilots.

	BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Israeli warplanes attacked suspected  
guerrilla hideouts in southern Lebanon today, hours after two 
Israeli soldiers were wounded in an attack, Lebanese security 
officials said. Israeli jets fired two missiles at guerrilla 
positions in a region that faces Rihan, a village in the 
Israeli-occupied zone, the officials said on condition of 
anonymity. The area is about nine miles north of Israel's border.

	JERUSALEM (AP) -- With his envoys about to head to Washington,  
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat urged the United States today to 
step in to break the latest deadlock in the peace process with 
Israel. Arafat's call was quickly rejected by the administration of 
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who last month won assurances 
from President Clinton that Washington would avoid the direct role 
it has taken in the past. In a series of direct talks, Israeli and 
Palestinian negotiators have been unable to work out how to 
implement the Wye peace deal brokered by President Clinton in 
October.

	Unusual Requirement for Mexico Jobs

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Pregnancy testing remains a common  
requirement in Mexico for women seeking jobs, whether in factories 
or executive suites, even though the government says it's illegal 
and human rights groups call it an invasion of privacy. Few Mexican 
women complain about the testing. In a nation where help-wanted 
postings frequently specify the required age, sex, marital status 
and ``appearance'' of would-be applicants, workers are little 
accustomed to insisting on their privacy or their rights.

<HEADLINE> Amateur Champ Chosen for Walker Cup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAR HILLS, N.J. (AP) -- David Gossett, who won the U.S. Amateur  
on Sunday, and Hunter Haas, who lost in the semifinals, were among 
the final five players chosen for the 10-man team that will 
represent the United States in the Walker Cup next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Golf Association had already selected the first five  
players that will compete in the matches against amateurs from 
Great Britain and Ireland at Nairn Golf Club in Nairn, Scotland, on 
Sept. 11-12. 
</P>
<P>
	Those players, announced in July, were 1997 U.S. Amateur  
champion Matt Kuchar, 22, of Lake Mary, Fla.; 1998 runner-up Tom 
McKnight, 45, of Galax, Va.; Jonathan Byrd, 21, of Columbia, S.C.; 
Tim Jackson, 40, of Germantown, Tenn.; and Edward Loar, 21, of 
Rockwall, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Gossett, 20, of Germantown, Tenn., and Haas, 22,  
of Norman, Okla., those selected Sunday were John ``Spider'' 
Miller, 49, of Bloomington, Ind.; Bryce Molder, 20, of Conway, 
Ark.; and Steve Scott, 22, of Coral Springs, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Danny Yates, 49, of Atlanta, the 1992 Mid-Amateur champion who  
played on the 1989 and 1993 Walker Cup teams, is the captain. 
</P>
<P>
	Begun in 1922, the Walker Cup is held every two years,  
alternately in the United States and the Great 
Britain-Ireland-Scotland region. Four foursomes and eight singles 
matches are played each day, with a total of 24 points available. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States leads the series 31-4-1. The sides have split  
the last two matches, with Great Britain and Ireland winning 14-10 
in 1995 at Royal Porthcawl Golf Club in Porthcawl, Wales, and the 
United States winning 18-6 at Quaker Ridge Golf Club in Scarsdale, 
N.Y., in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Barber Is New Queen of Heptathlon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- First, Eunice Barber wrapped a French flag  
around her shoulders. Then she thought about her roots and hoped 
peace would return to her native Sierra Leone. 
</P>
<P>
	Barber became a French citizen in February and gave her new  
country its first gold medal of the World Championships when she 
won the grueling two-day heptathlon on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's wonderful,'' Barber said after winning the 800 meters,  
the last of the seven events. ``It's a victory for France, for the 
people who have supported me, for my club, but I also share it with 
with my family in Sierra Leone and I hope peace would return to my 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mother gave me a lot of courage in my career,'' she said,  
then called her sister on a borrowed cellular phone. 
</P>
<P>
	But the first congratulatory call on another borrowed phone had  
come from Dominique Dufour, a French diplomat who opened a track 
and field club in Freetown, the Sierra Leone capital, and 
effectively launched Barber's career by convincing her to join it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dominique, Dominique ...,'' a barefoot Barber screamed into  
the phone, jumping up and down. She was tired but unable to contain 
her joy in the hot Seville night. 
</P>
<P>
	Barber, 24, competed for Sierra Leone at the last two Olympics,  
finishing fifth in Atlanta in 1996 and was fourth at the 1995 
worlds. But she always trained in France and finally took French 
citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
	As a child and young woman, Barber grew up playing at the  
stadium in Freetown, where her mother worked as a secretary. Barber 
ran, jumped and threw -- inevitably leading to a career in the 
multi-discipline event. 
</P>
<P>
	For fun, she and other girls danced and imitated Spice Girls to  
a rap rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, she was invited by the French Olympic Committee to  
visit the country that would later become her adopted nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Barber, who also holds the French long jump record at 23 feet,  
took charge of the heptathlon Saturday with personal bests in the 
100 hurdles and high jump and never looked back. She effectively 
sealed her victory with yet another personal best in the javelin 
Sunday, building up a huge lead heading into the 800. 
</P>
<P>
	With 6,861 points, she set the season's best total and a new  
French record, improving her old mark and personal best by more 
than 300 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Barber steamrolled over her chief rival, Denise Lewis of  
Britain, who collected 6,724 points for her second silver in as 
many world championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Ghada Shouaa of Syria, the Olympic gold medalist who missed two  
seasons with a serious back injury, made a stunning comeback by 
edging defending champion Sabine Braun of Germany by three points 
for the bronze with 6,500.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Reaches 50 Homers Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mark McGwire hit two home runs against the New  
York Mets on Sunday to become the first player to reach 50 homers 
in a season four straight years. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's 50th came on a 1-0 count leading off the seventh  
inning against Jeff Tam. The ball just cleared the outstretched 
glove of Shawon Dunston in left-center and landed just past the 
396-foot sign. 
</P>
<P>
	That was a routine fly compared to his first shot.  
</P>
<P>
	Big Mac left his mark on Shea Stadium in the first inning. He  
hit a 1-1 pitch from Octavio Dotel 502 feet -- his longest of the 
season -- and left a dent about 60 feet high on the scoreboard in 
right-center. 
</P>
<P>
	The shot shattered a lightbulb in the 16 for Ray Lankford's  
number -- just a few feet below McGwire's 25. In the bottom of the 
third inning, a worker climbed up the back of the scoreboard to 
screw in a new bulb. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire moved ahead of his pace from his record 70-homer season,  
hitting No. 50 in the Cardinals' 124th game -- one game earlier than 
last year. That is the second fastest pace ever, behind only 
Chicago's Sammy Sosa -- who hit his 51st Saturday in the Cubs' 121st 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire also tied Babe Ruth for the most 50-homer seasons in a  
career with four. Six players, including Sosa, have hit 50 in two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who has 230 homers over the last four years, has seven  
multihomer games this year and 60 in his career.

<HEADLINE> Crash With Tracy Angers Andretti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CICERO, Ill. (AP) -- Paul Tracy is auto racing's version of the  
obnoxious driver who hangs on others' bumpers and takes paint chips 
with him when he blows by. 
</P>
<P>
	He was at it again Sunday. And just like last year, Michael  
Andretti got tangled up in the mess. 
</P>
<P>
	Tracy knocked himself and Andretti out of the Target Grand Prix  
when he bumped Andretti and sent them both into a wall as they 
battled for third place. The crash left Andretti lightheaded -- and 
then livid. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't understand what Tracy was thinking,'' Andretti said.  
``He put me in an impossible position. He was swerving toward me 
beginning down the straightaway. He could have hurt me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Tracy has won once this year and is fourth in the points  
standings, his career has been tainted by his history of aggressive 
-- some say reckless -- driving. His nickname on the circuit is 
``Captain Crunch.'' Team Kool Green owner Barry Green had to tell 
him and teammate Dario Franchitti to knock it off after they had a 
series of bumps last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Tracy already had spent six races on probation last season  
before colliding with Andretti in Australia. After citing Tracy for 
blocking, risk and unsportsmanlike conduct, CART chief steward 
Wally Dallenbach made the unprecedented move of suspending Tracy 
for this season's opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``Paul Tracy did his normal driving out there,'' Andretti said.  
``He doesn't think, obviously. It's such a shame. He took both of 
us out of the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Tracy insisted the crash wasn't his fault. It was Andretti  
who wouldn't move out of the way when he tried to pass. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough to pass. A guy's got to let you go through,'' Tracy  
said. ``I got up beside him. He's got to let me by. If he doesn't 
back off, we're going to make contact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andretti and Tracy had just taken the green for the 99th lap and  
were heading into turn three when Tracy pulled up alongside 
Andretti to pass him. Etiquette calls for the slower driver to back 
off; Andretti didn't, but Tracy didn't appear to be that far ahead, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
	Tracy continued sliding over and down, finally bumping Andretti.  
Both cars spun hard into the wall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was watching him coming toward me. I'm going like, `Please,  
no, no -- BOOM!''' said Andretti, who was taken off the track in an 
ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
	Andretti doesn't plan to talk to Tracy about the incident, but  
he will talk to Dallenbach. 
</P>
<P>
	He's not the only one. Race winner Juan Montoya and runner-up  
Dario Franchitti accused P.J. Jones of blocking traffic, a 
complaint that's been made before this season. And third-place 
finisher Jimmy Vasser said Robby Gordon wouldn't move despite 
several blue flags that are supposed to signal a driver to let a 
faster car pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallenbach left the track shortly after the race and could not  
be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talk about lap traffic all the time. Guys are supposed to  
give a little when they see that blue flag,'' Vasser said. ``I 
don't understand why these things are not being done. I don't 
understand why black flags are not being thrown.''

<HEADLINE> Ernie Irvan Continues Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLYN, Mich. (AP) -- Ernie Irvan, who sustained a bruised lung  
and a mild head injury after crashing Friday at Michigan Speedway, 
continued to recover at a nearby hospital Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvan remained in good condition at St. Joseph Mercy and would  
stay overnight for further observation, his family said in a 
release through the speedway following the running of the Pepsi 
400. 
</P>
<P>
	Tommy Cameron, public relations director for the speedway, said  
Irvan's family had decided not to grant interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvan, who was injured five years to the day after a near-fatal  
wreck on the same track, was replaced in Sunday's race by Dick 
Trickle. He got caught up in a multi-car crash that included Kevin 
LePage, Ricky Rudd and others and finished 40th, completing only 
178 of the 200 laps. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvan, 40, was knocked unconscious in the crash in turn 4 during  
a Busch Grand National practice session, but became responsive as 
he was being transported to the infield medical center. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers trying to get Irvan out had to cut the roof from his  
car. He appeared to lose control of his Pontiac and spun in turn 4 
on the banked 2-mile oval. The rear quarter panel struck the 
concrete wall before the driver's side made contact. 
</P>
<P>
	As he was removed from the car, Irvan appeared to pick his arm  
up in what looked like a wave. 
</P>
<P>
	When Irvan crashed in turn 2 during Winston Cup practice on Aug.  
20, 1994, he was unconscious for two days and had critical brain 
and chest injuries. He was given only a 10 percent chance of 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
	But he returned to the Winston Cup circuit on Oct. 1, 1995, in  
North Wilkesboro, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvan had planned to compete in both the Busch Series race  
Saturday and the Winston Cup event. He co-owns the Busch car, and 
is in his second year driving the Winston Cup car for MB2 
Motorsports. Last month, Irvan's contract was extended through the 
end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvan has 15 Winston Cup victories, but none since taking the  
June race at Michigan in 1997. He is 26th this year in the 
standings. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvan was attempting to make his third Busch start this season.  
His only other Busch races were in Richmond, Va., on May 14, and in 
Dover, Del., on June 5. He was involved in a three-car crash and 
failed to finish the Dover race.

<HEADLINE> Miller Tries Gourmet Soda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Miller Brewing Co. is shaking up its beverage  
lineup with the beer maker's planned entrance in the gourmet soft 
drink market. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller is assuming control of three gourmet sodas -- root beer,  
vanilla cream and orange cream -- produced under the Henry 
Weinhard's brand name. The Milwaukee-based company acquired the 
sodas in April through its purchase of beer brands from Stroh 
Brewery Co. 
</P>
<P>
	It marks the first time Miller has produced non-alcoholic  
beverages -- except for Sharp's, its non-alcoholic beer -- since the 
repeal of Prohibition. Miller's two largest rivals -- 
Annheuser-Busch Inc. and Adolph Coors Co. -- do not produce sodas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We view it as an opportunity,'' Miller spokeswoman Susan  
Henderson said Friday. She added that the Weinhard sodas had 
double-digit sales growth in 1998, with sales continuing to grow in 
the first half of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The Weinhard sodas are higher-priced specialty products sold  
primarily in Oregon, Washington and California, Henderson said. 
Miller plans to continue that market focus, although there will be 
limited distribution in other states, Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the three-way April deal, Stroh sold its brands to Pabst  
Brewing Co. and Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the sodas, the Stroh brands sold to Miller were  
Henry Weinhard's beer and Mickeys malt liquor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Weinhard soda and beer brands both are produced at Stroh's  
brewery in Portland, Ore., which is scheduled to close soon. 
</P>
<P>
	When that happens, Miller plans to transfer production of both  
the Weinhard's beer and soda brands to its Tumwater, Wash., 
brewery, Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pabst has sold the Tumwater brewery to Miller, and Miller is to  
assume control of that site on Sept. 1.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Up in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar slipped against the yen early Monday as  
a further sharp gain on the Tokyo Stock Exchange boosted 
yen-buying. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 111.10 yen in early trading, down 0.38 yen  
from late Friday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 
111.52 yen on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed 233.73  
points, or 1.29 percent, to 18,331.84 in the first 30 minutes of 
trading. On Friday, the average closed up 218.37 points, or 1.22 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, interbank players bought back the yen by  
selling dollars to adjust positions on the stock market's advance. 
</P>
<P>
	But traders said the dollar would remain in a narrow range ahead  
of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy-making committee meeting 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Most economists expect the Fed to carry out a  
quarter-percentage-point increase in short-term interest rates to 
contain inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 118.62 yen, down  
from 119.16 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices opened higher amid active buying of  
financial issues following Friday's announcement Friday by three 
major Japanese commercial banks that they will form a joint holding 
company next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd., Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. and  
Fuji Bank Ltd. formally announced they will merge in the autumn of 
2000 to consolidate their operations. The new entity will become 
the world's largest financial institution with assets of around 140 
trillion (drs 1.26 trillion). 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 136.77 points  
to 11,100.61 at Friday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 22.85 points, or 1.52 percent, to 1,521.79. 
The TOPIX closed up 23.59 points, or 1.60 percent, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.900 percent from Friday's finish of 1.8650 percent, 
driving its price down to 99.15 yen from 99.44 yen.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Trying Rice Waste as Fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OROVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- California's first attempt to turn rice  
stubble and tree trimmings into ethanol resembles a scene from 
``Back to the Future,'' when trash is dumped into Mr. Fusion at one 
end and pure energy comes out the other. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed ``bio-refinery'' will convert thousands of tons of  
rice straw, orchard prunings and other agricultural waste into 
ethanol, a sort of 200-proof moonshine that state air-pollution 
fighters hope will soon replace the unpopular additive MTBE in 
California gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see it as an efficient waste-based ethanol plant that takes  
advantage of low-cost and no-cost materials,'' said Stephen J. 
Gatto, head of Boston-based BC International Corp., which plans to 
start construction next year south of Oroville, 60 miles north of 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice farmers see it as a match made in heaven.  
</P>
<P>
	Blocked by state air regulators from burning their stubble, the  
growers disc the hardy straw back into the ground. That costs $30 
an acre, about a fourth of the growers' profits. 
</P>
<P>
	About 500,000 acres of rice are grown in the Sacramento Valley,  
producing about 1.5 million tons of rice straw. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice growers have hunted for ways to use rice straw since new  
air-quality rules took effect in 1993. House insulation, woven 
furniture and scaffolding were among the uses tried. None worked 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	Growers believe they've found the answer in ethanol.  
</P>
<P>
	``We can get this stuff off the field and at least break even.  
That's all we really want to do with the rice stubble -- break 
even,'' said Ken Collins, who farms 1,600 acres of rice near Biggs 
and plans to ship his rice straw to the new plant. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oroville factory will convert about 75,000 tons of rice  
straw, 125,000 tons of orchard slash and 40,000 tons of other 
agricultural waste into ethanol each year. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're looking at about 900 tons there,'' Collins said, as his  
workers tended to a two-story-high mound of bailed rice straw 
culled from his fields. Collins is among a group of growers who 
have formed a cooperative to feed the new plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethanol is a familiar product in the Midwest, where factories  
convert corn starch into about 1.6 billion gallons annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Illinois, South Dakota, North Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa and  
Minnesota are among states with ethanol factories, providing a 
market for the states' corn growers and a cleaner mix of fuel for 
states facing EPA air pollution-fighting mandates. 
</P>
<P>
	A bushel of corn produces about 2.5 gallons of ethanol.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're making corn whiskey, is what it amounts to. But ethanol  
is very clean. It clearly is a benefit to air quality, and it does 
add octane,'' said Trevor Guthmiller, executive director of the 
South Dakota-based American Coalition for Ethanol. 
</P>
<P>
	Midwestern ethanol growers see California -- and its more than 20  
million licensed drivers -- as a huge new market. BCI's factory, 
expected to open by 2001, won't produce enough ethanol to replace 
all 540 million gallons of MTBE burned annually in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists generally supported Gov. Gray Davis' March  
decision to phase out MTBE, or methyl tertiary butyl ether, noting 
that MTBE contamination had been reported in lakes and groundwater 
across the state. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner  
said last month the EPA would seek to reduce the use of MTBE, 
citing a threat to drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oxygenated Fuels Association, an Arlington, Va.-based trade  
association representing MTBE producers, said the compound protects 
air quality and will prove costly to replace. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the most cost-effective and cleanest source of octane,''  
said Terry Wigglesworth, the group's executive director. ``Replace 
that with something else that's not proven, and you're going to 
have all kinds of problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ethanol backers say the cost to motorists would be about the  
same in California as with MTBE. In the Midwest, ethanol has had 
little effect on pump prices, Guthmiller said. California's 
gasoline prices already are among the highest in the nation, with 
unleaded regular averaging about $1.50 a gallon recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Gatto said ethanol has uses beyond gasoline, including  
mouthwash, aftershave, perfume and solvents. 
</P>
<P>
	The Midwestern plants derive sugar from corn starch to make the  
ethanol, a relatively simple process. In Brazil, ethanol is made 
using cane sugar. 
</P>
<P>
	BCI's plant, expected to open by 2001, will use new technology  
to separate cellulose from the ``biomass'' -- wood, straw, leaves, 
fruit pits and other items -- and use that sugar to make the 
ethanol. 
</P>
<P>
	The California Energy Commission is studying the use of ethanol  
and other compounds as fuel additives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, the technology is there and it's not that difficult  
to produce ethanol through the conversion process,'' commission 
spokeswoman Claudia Chandler said. ``The question is, `Is it 
economical and is there a market for it?''' 
</P>
<P>
	The BCI operation will produce about 22 million gallons of  
ethanol a year, or roughly 70 to 100 gallons per ton of biomass. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins and others believe it's just a start.  
</P>
<P>
	``We could use all our rice straw and all our orchard prunings,  
and we'd still hardly sustain the demand,'' Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar biomass ethanol plant, also run by BCI, has begun  
operation in Jennings, La. It produces about 22 million gallons 
annually. That plant cost about $90 million, and the Oroville 
facility is expected to cost about the same, Gatto said.

<HEADLINE> Boggs Honored for 3,000th Hit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Wade Boggs Day had an emotional  
start. 
</P>
<P>
	The newest member of baseball's 3,000-hit club emerged from the  
Tampa Bay Devil Rays' dugout Sunday and immediately walked over and 
hugged Ted Williams, arguably the greatest hitter ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``I read your book in high school and you gave me the  
inspiration to just try and be a little bit as good as you,'' Boggs 
said during the on-field ceremony. ``That inspiration has carried 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who took off and tipped his hat following Boggs'  
comment, was one of the baseball notables in attendance. Others 
included former manager John McNamara and hitting coach Walt 
Hriniak. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a little different type hitter than some other great  
hitters I've seen, but they in turn haven't been Wade Boggs,'' 
Williams said. ``Three thousand and four (hits) ... wow. Anybody 
that gets 3,000 hits in this game, buddy, can hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs' wife Debbie, daughter Meagan, son Brett and father Win  
also took part in the ceremony. Boggs became emotional when talking 
about the role his father played in his baseball development and 
when thanking the fans. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 40-minute ceremony, Boggs was presented with the home  
plate he kissed after becoming the first player to homer for his 
3,000th hit Aug. 7th. 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs also received the Joseph Cronin Award for significant  
achievement from AL President Dr. Gene Budig and a fishing boat 
from the Devil Rays. 
</P>
<P>
	Activities before the Devil Rays' game against Kansas City  
included video tributes from Tony Gwynn, who also reached the 
3,000-hit mark this season, George Brett and Reggie Jackson.

	CICERO, Ill. (AP) -- With a beach volleyball pit, a juggler on  
stilts and a semi-trailer filled with Sony PlayStations, the 
inaugural Target Grand Prix was part auto race, part carnival. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great,'' said Paul Lanigan of Chicago. ``You've got to  
figure a quarter of the people couldn't care less, so it's good to 
have something else to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Auto racing came back to Chicago for the first time in more than  
40 years Sunday. Though the city was the site of the first known 
car race in the United States on Nov. 28, 1895, there hasn't been a 
major race here since 1957. 
</P>
<P>
	Which partly explains the circus-like atmosphere at the Chicago  
Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``It came off as an event, not just a race. The world doesn't  
need any more races. But an event ...,'' said Chip Ganassi, 
president of the speedway and co-owner of Target/Chip Gnassi 
Racing. 
</P>
<P>
	While true race fans wandered the infield checking out the cars,  
taking pictures of the drivers and gawking at the teams' huge 
transporters before the race, there were plenty of sideshows to 
entertain those who were only partly curious in racing. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Extreme Volleyball Professionals put on an  
exhibition in the middle of the infield. There was a tent where 
children could get their faces painted and temporary tattoos. 
Another tent had about a dozen video games, as well as the truck 
filled with PlayStations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice,'' said Judy Murnane of Burbank, Ill., a NASCAR fan  
attending her first CART race. ``You can move around and walk 
around instead of sitting in the seats all day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	OK, but what about the race? Great, fans said. The entire track  
could be seen from all but the bottom five rows of the grandstand, 
and there was a Jumbotron at the start line to give fans a better 
view. 
</P>
<P>
	The only complaint was about the track -- it's not long enough.  
With a one-mile oval, it's unlikely there will ever be a 500-mile 
race at the CMS. Sunday's race was 225 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chicago's been waiting for a track for a long time,'' said Gil  
Weeden, a Chicago fan who's gone to the Indianapolis 500 for the 
last 27 years. ``Now that we've finally got one, it should be 500 
miles.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CONTRACT EXTENDED:* PacWest Racing had a busy day Sunday -- and  
that was before the race even began. 
</P>
<P>
	The team announced a two-year contract extension for Mark  
Blundell, who finished 21st after starting in the middle of the 
first row at the Target Grand Prix. Blundell, who's in his fourth 
season with the team, has won three times in the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
	PacWest also announced that Motorola will continue its title  
sponsorship for two more seasons, with an option for a third year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look forward to winning the championship next year,'' said  
Bruce McCaw, PacWest's president. ``No pressure, Mark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	PacWest has a second car, and that driver and the equipment  
lineup will be announced before the Sept. 12 race in Monterey, 
Calif. Though Mauricio Gugelmin is the current driver, speculation 
has been that he'll be replaced by Roberto Moreno. Moreno drove 
Blundell's car after Blundell broke his collarbone May 4. He missed 
eight races, returning for the Detroit Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STAR-GAZING:* So taking a curve at 90 mph isn't enough of a  
thrill for you? How about taking that curve with Paul Newman behind 
the wheel? 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, that white-haired driver giving rides in the pace car  
Sunday afternoon really was Newman. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was fabulous!'' said Chris Bidwill, wife of track co-owner  
Charles Bidwill III. ``He was very nice. Very friendly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newman and Mario Andretti were celebrity drivers Sunday for PPG  
Motorsports pace car program. Rides with the actor and the former 
Indianapolis 500 winner were auctioned off for charity -- the high 
bid for a ride with Newman was $10,000 -- but the two stuck around 
afterward to give other rides. 
</P>
<P>
	Bidwill didn't know she'd be riding with Newman until he pulled  
up next to her in a blue Lexus. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `The race cars go three times as fast and BOOM!'''  
she said. ``It was exciting and he went very fast. He's a very good 
driver.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 500 rides were given over the week, said John Love, a  
spokesman for PPG Industries. PPG usually takes 11 of its 36 pace 
cars to each week's race, Love said, giving rides to corporate 
sponsors, guests and the media. 
</P>
<P>
	``Racing is something very few people get to experience. So if  
we can give people a little of the experience, it helps us all in 
the understanding and appreciation for the event,'' Love said. 
``It's especially important here at a new market.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *UNSWEETENED:* The inaugural Target Grand Prix was missing only  
one thing: Walter Payton. 
</P>
<P>
	Payton, co-owner of Payton-Coyne Racing, had to sit out the  
first race in his adopted hometown in more than 40 years because he 
wasn't feeling well, said his partner, Dale Coyne. The NFL's 
all-time leading rusher has a rare liver disease and is awaiting a 
transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's fair,'' Coyne said before Sunday's race.

<HEADLINE> Dole Vows Crusade Against Drug Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Days after George W. Bush's campaign  
crisis over questions about possible illegal drug use, GOP rival 
Elizabeth Dole promised Sunday to ``lead a crusade'' against 
illegal drugs if elected president. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole told the National Foundation for Women Legislators' annual  
convention that as president she would push a campaign ``that's 
comprehensive and fully funded where drugs are concerned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``With leadership and the use of that bully pulpit, I think we  
can have a crusade across this country to remove and rid America of 
illegal drugs that are poisoning our children today,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole later denied the announcement was related to Bush's crisis  
this past week over whether he ever had used illegal drugs. She 
said she has pushed the issue since leaving her post as head of the 
American Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
	Questioned repeatedly about possible drug use, Bush, the GOP  
frontrunner, said he had not used illegal drugs in the past 25 
years, but would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	On other issues, Dole told the group of bipartisan women leaders  
that she was encouraged by her ``close to No. 2'' finish in the 
Aug. 14 straw poll in Iowa. She finished third behind magazine 
publisher Steve Forbes. Bush won the contest. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole also said her 30 years of management experience, with the  
federal transportation and labor departments, then at the American 
Red Cross, adequately prepared her for the job of steering the 
country to a better place.

<HEADLINE> Geologist: 2 Quakes Hit Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- The earthquake that struck western  
Turkey earlier this week was made up of two consecutive quakes, a 
leading geologist said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prof. Aykut Barka of Istanbul Technical University said the  
tremors were 20 seconds apart, and their epicenter was near the 
northwestern town of Izmit, 90 miles east of Istanbul. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, the two quakes lasted about 45 seconds at 3 a.m.  
Tuesday, Barka told the private NTV television station. 
</P>
<P>
	The death toll in the 7.4-magnitude quake has surpassed 12,000  
and some officials have predicted as many as 40,000 could have 
died. 
</P>
<P>
	Several U.S. and European seismologists have arrived in Turkey  
to study the quake. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Presgrave, a geophysicist with the U.S Geological Survey  
National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo., said it is 
common for large earthquakes to occur in multiple surges in rapid 
succession. 
</P>
<P>
	``Almost every earthquake bigger than a 6-point magnitude is a  
multiple event,'' he said. ``It's almost impossible to break a 
chunk of rock that long in one instance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only in the last 20 years has technology allowed scientists to  
detect multiple events in a major quake, he said.

<HEADLINE> Coppola Goes Back to Roots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Francis Ford Coppola is getting back to his roots,  
camera in hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Coppola's grandfather, Agostino, emigrated to United States from  
Bernalda in the southern province of Basilicata and the director 
still has relatives there. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with the daily Corriere della Sera published  
Sunday, the director said he has been filming Bernalda's streets 
and houses, his relatives and the festival honoring the town's 
patron saint. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Godfather III,'' Coppola recreated the colorful festival,  
which he said his father Carmine had told him about ``a hundred 
times.'' Coppola also cast a cousin from Bernalda in a small role. 
</P>
<P>
	Returning to his roots puts him back in touch with the ``real  
value of things,'' Coppola said.

<HEADLINE> Ford To Begin Separate SUV Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co.'s expanding line of sport  
utility vehicles will get its own advertising campaign in the fall 
with an outdoors-adventure theme. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign, which begins with the start of the 2000 model year  
Oct. 1, will use the tagline ``no boundaries.'' Each ad will focus 
on outdoor activities in which Ford SUVs can be used. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford recently began selling its newest SUV, the Excursion, the  
largest on the market. It also plans to introduce the Explorer 
Sport Trac and F-150 SuperCrew -- two SUV-pickup combos -- early next 
year. A small SUV, tentatively called the Escape, debuts later in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The new entries join the popular Explorer and Expedition SUVs.  
</P>
<P>
	The campaign will be linked with special SUV displays at most  
Ford dealerships. The displays will have an outfitter theme and 
show the kind of gear SUVs can carry, such as bicycles, kayaks and 
camping equipment. Buyers will get a catalog of SUV accessories, 
which will also be displayed in the showrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``It allows us to differentiate the Ford showroom from the other  
volume brands in the marketplace,'' said brand manager J.C. 
Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	The approach is similar to that used by lower-volume SUV  
retailer Land Rover North America Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford also will have a ``no boundaries'' site on the World Wide  
Web and sponsor outdoors events, such as ski races and the World 
Outside Festival with Outside Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign will initially include television, print and  
billboard ads. Radio will be added later. 
</P>
<P>
	Actor John Corbett will narrate the TV ads, which were created  
by the J. Walter Thompson agency. Corbett, a regular in the late TV 
series ``Northern Exposure,'' has appeared in a series of ``story 
ads'' for Ford vehicles since early last year. 
</P>
<P>
	By lumping all of Ford's SUVs in one ad campaign, the No. 2  
automaker expects to get more out of its advertising dollars at a 
time when it's undertaking a big campaign to launch its new Focus 
line of subcompacts. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the number of launches that we have, we felt it was the  
most efficient and effective way to show the complete lineup that 
we have,'' Collins said Friday.

<HEADLINE> Wolford May Cause Steelers a Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Steelers' handling of retired  
offensive tackle Will Wolford's contract is being investigated by 
the NFL for possible salary cap violations and could subject them 
to a fine or the loss of draft picks, The Associated Press learned 
Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Steelers president Dan Rooney acknowledged the Steelers turned  
themselves into the NFL after determining they may have violated 
salary cap restrictions, but he would not identify the player 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will confirm that we told the league that this may be a  
problem and we reported it,'' Rooney said Sunday night. ``They have 
it under investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Steelers may have turned themselves in as early as three  
months ago, but did not comment until now because it was under 
league investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's between the players union and the NFL,'' Rooney said.  
``We are not saying anything about it. We're just saying we turned 
ourselves in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rooney said the Steelers do not consider it to be a ``serious  
violation'' and they do not have any idea if they will be 
disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
	Coincidentally, Rooney, one of the NFL's most powerful owners  
and the man largely responsible for ending two NFL strikes because 
of his influence with the players, serves on the NFL's labor 
council. 
</P>
<P>
	Steelers director of football operations Tom Donahoe also is  
regarded as one of the league's experts on salary cap management. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think we did anything too serious, but we felt it  
still deserved an investigation by them,'' Rooney said. ``We don't 
want to be breaking the rules. I'm on the labor council.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Steelers were last fined by the NFL -- $25,000 -- for failing  
to make all of their players available for interviews before the 
Super Bowl in Tempe, Ariz., in January 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	An NFL-assigned arbitrator will determine whether the Steelers  
are subject to a fine that CNN-SI reported could reach $2 million, 
or the possible loss of draft choices. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolford's 1999 contract had a cap value of $2.575 million. If  
the NFL determines that Wolford's contract should count against the 
Steelers' cap, they would be considerably over their cap and thus 
would be subject to a fine. 
</P>
<P>
	If the NFL finds that the Steelers violated the cap, it may be  
because Wolford tried to do the Steelers a favor by delaying his 
retirement as they weighed how to replace injured tackle Justin 
Strzelczyk, who reinjured his knee last spring and may miss the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolford, who played last season with a torn chest muscle, told  
friends in January that he would pass up a $2.1 million contract 
for this season and would retire. He held a retirement party at his 
Kentucky home a month later. 
</P>
<P>
	But Steelers coach Bill Cowher asked the former Pro Bowl lineman  
to reconsider and to return for at least one more season. Wolford 
previously accommodated Cowher last season by shifting from guard, 
his preferred position, to left tackle after John Jackson signed 
with the San Diego Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolford tore his chest muscle in the fourth game of the 1998  
season, missed two of the next three games and started the final 
eight, effectively playing with one arm for much of the season, he 
said later. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolford initially considered retiring before the 1998 season,  
when he injured his neck in a swimming pool accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after Wolford told the Steelers last winter that he wanted  
to retire, Cowher held out hope that he might return, if only to 
play on passing downs. His agent, Ralph Cindrich, said Wolford 
might be receptive to such an arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
	But after the Steelers signed former St. Louis Rams left tackle  
Wayne Gandy to a $14 million, four-year contract, they released 
Wolford a day later, on April 7. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, the San Francisco 49ers confirmed that the NFL was  
looking into possible salary cap violations during the time Carmen 
Policy was the team's president and Dwight Clark was the general 
manager. Both have since gone to work for the Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN-SI reported the player involved was tight end Brent Jones,  
himself a former Steelers player.

<HEADLINE> GM Going Ahead With Thai Auto Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- When U.S. auto giant General Motors  
unveiled plans to build its Southeast Asian production center in 
Thailand less than three years ago, the sky seemed the limit for 
the regional car industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Asian economies were booming and the demand for swanky sedans  
was growing. Nothing looked like it could get in the way for 
another prize foreign investment deal for tigerish Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the financial crisis in 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	GM's plans to produce 100,000 vehicles a year at a $640 million  
new plant on Thailand's eastern seaboard were dashed, as the 
regional motor market plunged even faster than Asian currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the Thai economy showing some signs of recovery, GM is  
pressing ahead, albeit on a vastly smaller scale than first 
envisioned. The first vehicles are set to roll off the production 
line in May 2000, 16 months behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first the capacity was going to be 100,000 units per year,  
but due to the economic crisis, we scaled that down to 40,000 per 
year,'' Kantanit Sukontasap, vice-president for corporate affairs 
at GM (Thailand), told The Associated Press in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
	And fittingly enough, instead of churning out grand four-door  
sedans as everyone expected, the Thai plant will become GM's second 
factory for the more humble mini multipurpose vehicle, the Zafira. 
</P>
<P>
	Following its European launch in April, the middle-priced  
minivan has proved popular, with GM's plant in Germany unable to 
fill orders that have so far totaled over 40,000 units, Kantanit 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-seater model is set to retail at between $16,200 and  
$21,600, which GM hopes will undercut imported competition. 
</P>
<P>
	But only 15 percent of production from the Thai plant will be  
for the local market, with the rest destined for export to various 
parts of the world. 
</P>
<P>
	GM will be pushing very hard to sell the Zafira in Asia to  
expand its meager share of the Japanese-dominated market from less 
than 1 percent at the moment to some 10 percent within three years, 
Kantanit said. 
</P>
<P>
	He is hopeful that if the vehicle proves a success in the  
region, GM would expand its production in Thailand, to reach an 
annual capacity of 100,000 vehicles, as originally intended. 
</P>
<P>
	While the economic jury is still out on Thailand's prospects of  
sustained recovery, the U.S. firm, which has already invested $500 
million on the plant at Rayong, insists it is upbeat about the 
country's prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why we are here and will be here for the long-term,''  
Kantanit said. ``We believe that the Thai economy will start to 
really take off next year and that will coincide with our start of 
commercial operations midyear 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plant is set for completion by 1999.

<HEADLINE> Paper: Pistons, Grizzlies Talk Swap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- The Detroit Pistons have proposed  
trading forwards Jerry Stackhouse and Loy Vaught and a first-round 
draft pick to the Vancouver Grizzlies for five players, including 
Steve Francis and Doug West, according to The Oakland Press of 
Pontiac. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to guards Francis, the second overall pick in this  
year's draft, and West, the Pistons would receive forward Michael 
Smith and guards Lee Mayberry and Rodrick Rhodes, the unidentified 
Pistons sources told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	The draft pick would be the first-round pick that Vancouver  
still owes the Pistons from the Otis Thorpe trade in 1997, the 
newspaper reported. Because Stackhouse and Vaught will make a 
combined $8.5 million this season, Vancouver needs to include five 
players to make the trade conform to salary cap rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pistons have denied the trade proposal, but two club sources  
told the newspaper the offer is ``on the table'' and the Pistons 
are waiting to hear from the Grizzlies. One source said the trade 
is ``a long shot,'' and the other said the odds of it happening are 
``30-70 against.''

<HEADLINE> Brooks Happy To Dump Bachelorhood </HEADLINE>

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Albert Brooks finally abandoned his bachelor's  
life at age 50. Now he's reaping the benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life, in general, used to be very lonely,'' Brooks told The  
New York Times in a story published Sunday. The 
writer-actor-director married two years ago and now has a young 
son. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see people who remain single and immerse themselves in their  
work, and I don't know how they do it. It's very important to be 
grounded somewhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks latest film, ``The Muse,'' deals with an aging Hollywood  
writer trying to get the magic back in his career. Its creator 
credits home and family with doing that for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his newfound paternal bliss, the creative force behind  
such films as ``Lost in America,'' ``Defending Your Life,'' and 
``Mother'' still has his edge, especially when it comes to talking 
about a regular Hollywood nemesis: the studio executive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Have you ever noticed how no executives' names are ever  
mentioned in a bad review?'' Brooks says. ``That would be a hell of 
a thing to do! Mention all of the executives involved! It would be 
like printing pictures of drunk drivers!''

<HEADLINE> Gates' Foundation Richest in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft founder Bill Gates now has the  
country's richest charitable foundation, the Chronicle of 
Philanthropy reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates and his wife, Melinda, have consolidated their two  
charitable foundations and donated an additional $6 billion to the 
new Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, bringing its total worth to 
$17.1 billion. The couple decided to merge the William H. Gates 
Foundation and the Gates Learning Foundation so they could broaden 
their focus on learning and global health, foundation co-chairwoman 
Patty Stonesifer said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chronicle reports in its Aug. 26 issue that, with the $6  
billion donation, the Seattle-based foundation is significantly 
wealthier than others in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The report names the David and Lucile Packard Foundation as the  
second wealthiest, with assets of $13 billion. The Ford Foundation, 
with $11.4 billion, is third. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gates Foundation isn't the biggest in the world. That title  
currently belongs to the London-based Wellcome Trust, which has 
assets of $19.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Chronicle reports that the Gates Foundation could climb  
to the top of the list if the charity's namesake keeps on giving. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill and Melinda have made a gift of about $5 billion every  
quarter,'' said Stonesifer. While she would not say whether the 
couple plans to make another gift of similar size before year's 
end, she said she expects that the general pattern of giving ``will 
continue.''

<HEADLINE> Hundreds March Against Hate in L.A. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hundreds of people of different  
nationalities, ethnicities and faiths participated Sunday in a 
March Against Hate following the recent shooting rampage at a 
Jewish community center. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to build unity across perceived groups -- race,  
ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion and disability -- so 
that we all respond to every hate crime no matter who that hate 
crime is perpetrated against,'' said Jean Morrison, spokeswoman for 
the march. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of the North Valley Jewish Community Center shooting  
that left an adult woman, a teen-age camp counselor and three 
children injured, the March Against Hate drew about 500 people who 
united to help eliminate hate-based violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Buford O. Furrow Jr. has been charged with murder and attempted  
murder in the Aug. 10 center shooting, where five people were 
injured, including three children. Shortly after the shooting, the 
37-year-old white supremacist allegedly killed Filipino-American 
postal worker Joseph Ileto. He remains jailed awaiting on federal 
and state charges. 
</P>
<P>
	As the crowd marched, some chanted, ``No more hate. We march for  
peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mile-long march ended at a Shadow Ranch Park where Rabbi Dov  
Fischer of the West Valley Hebrew Academy led a prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	``When good people do not stand up to be part of the solution,  
then indeed we are part of the problem,'' Fischer said.

	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Commission is has launched  
a routine antitrust inquiry into an agreement between U.S. drugs 
giant Pfizer Inc. and Germany's Hoechst Marion Roussel AG to 
cooperate in the manufacture and sale of inhalable insulin. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies formally filed the agreement for regulatory  
approval with the European Union executive agency July 29, 
according to a notice published Friday in the EU's Official 
Journal. All major mergers and joint-ventures impacting on markets 
within the 15-nation bloc require approval from the Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU called on interested parties to file their views within  
10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies in November announced an agreement to jointly  
construct an insulin production center in Frankfurt, Germany, and 
to couple their global sales and marketing resources to 
commercialize inhaled insulin that will reduce the reliance of 
diabetics on insulin injections.

Hurricane Andrew in 1992, the National Weather Service declared 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A vital difference between Bret and Andrew, the service's Jim

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hurricane Bret has the ``clear potential of  
producing a major disaster,'' possibly more destructive than 
Hurricane Andrew in 1992, the National Weather Service declared 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A vital difference between Bret and Andrew, the service's Jim  
Hoke said, is that the hurricane bearing down on the Texas east 
coast is moving much slower while carrying the same 140 mph winds. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoke appeared with officials of the Federal Emergency Management  
Agency to discuss preparations for the expected afternoon or 
evening landfall. 
</P>
<P>
	FEMA's director of response and recovery operations, Bruce  
Bahghman, said the agency has prepared four emergency medical and 
relief teams for deployment once the location of Bret's landfall is 
certain.

<TEXT>
<P>
	CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) -- Hurricane Bret, the biggest storm  
to hit Texas in nearly 20 years, roared ashore Sunday with 
horizontal sheets of rain and 125-mph winds that whipped and bent 
palm trees and forced thousands of people to flee inland. 
</P>
<P>
	The rapidly developing storm made landfall about 6 p.m. in  
sparsely populated Kenedy County, about 70 miles south of Corpus 
Christi. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities reported no injuries in the hours just after  
landfall. No major damage was immediately apparent as the storm 
moved inland Sunday night, but there was no word about largely 
unpopulated areas directly in the hurricane's path. 
</P>
<P>
	Businesses and homes were shuttered from Brownsville to north of  
Corpus Christi, and highways leading inland were packed with 
bumper-to-bumper traffic for miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Winds of 125 mph, with gusts even higher, extended 40 miles out  
from the storm. Forecasters warned about tornadoes spawned by the 
storm, a foot or more of rain and a storm surge that could approach 
25 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	The tightly focused storm had the ``clear potential of producing  
major disaster,'' said Jim Hoke, director of the National Weather 
Service's National Hydrometeorological Emergency Center. He 
compared the storm with Hurricane Andrew, which battered Florida in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike Andrew, which hit densely populated South Florida,  
Bret hit between Corpus Christi (population of 275,000) and 
Brownsville (132,000). 
</P>
<P>
	``The good news is that the core of the hurricane ... is not  
over the more populated areas,'' said Max Mayfield of the National 
Hurricane Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The path resembles that of 1980's Hurricane Allen, which packed  
winds of 185 mph and did $55 million in property damage but killed 
only two people when it came ashore. 
</P>
<P>
	Palm trees whipped as the wind strengthened in early afternoon  
and Corpus Christi Bay was covered with whitecaps as the Category 4 
storm came ashore. 
</P>
<P>
	As the storm hit, some people braved driving rain and rolling  
surf to walk on Corpus Christi beaches. A few even grabbed 
surfboards or swam. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina DeLeon, 23, was on the beach with her husband, Jesus,  
making a videotape of the storm for their unborn daughter, Zara, 
who is due in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``She'll probably say, 'Mom, you're crazy,'' Carolina DeLeon  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Corpus Christi declared a state of disaster and called for a  
general but voluntary evacuation of the city of 300,000 residents, 
said city spokesman Ted Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are really trying to drive home the point that we take this  
very seriously,'' Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The evacuation was ``proceeding in an orderly fashion,'' Corpus  
Christi City Manager David Garcia said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency officials in San Antonio set up shelters at Lackland  
Air Force Base in anticipation of thousands of fleeing residents. 
Families pouring into shelters were told to bring only what they 
needed because of cramped quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Many San Antonio hotels offered lowered evacuee rates with proof  
of residence in the hurricane-chewed region. 
</P>
<P>
	Like monstrous Hurricane Allen, Bret hit one of the state's  
least populated areas, the ranch land of Kleberg and Kenedy 
counties between Brownsville and Corpus Christi. However, tropical 
storm-force winds of up to 73 mph extended more than 100 miles 
outward from the center, the National Hurricane Center said. 
</P>
<P>
	The King Ranch occupies much of Kenedy and Kleberg counties.  
Ranch president Jack Hunt said about 50 people had been evacuated 
but there was no way to protect about 55,000 head of cattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cattle will just have to ride it out,'' Hunt said. ``It's  
not practical to move them out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most residents had left coastal Padre and Mustang islands, where  
a mandatory order was issued and police went door-to-door urging 
people to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. George W. Bush said he would sign disaster proclamations  
for seven counties: Aransas, San Patricio, Kenedy, Cameron, 
Willacy, Nueces and Kleberg. 
</P>
<P>
	At 8 p.m. EDT, the center of Bret was located about 60 miles  
south of Corpus Christi. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas hadn't been hit by a hurricane since Hurricane Jerry  
killed three people in October 1989. However, the state's 
367-mile-long coast has been struck by tropical storms since then, 
including Charley, which dumped 18 inches of rain and killed 19 
people in August 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm initially had been expected to head for Mexico's  
northern coast. But after Bret turned onto a course toward southern 
Texas, Mexico got little more than strong wind and warm rain.

<HEADLINE> Rodman Arrested on Drunk Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Flamboyant basketball star Dennis  
Rodman was arrested for allegedly being drunk in public and causing 
a disturbance at a restaurant, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The former NBA all-star, known for his brightly dyed hair and  
numerous body piercings, spent a few hours in the city jail before 
being released without bail early Sunday, police Sgt. Jim Kaminsky 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The owner of Woody's Wharf restaurant-bar called police Saturday  
night and ``alleged that Mr. Rodman was intoxicated and causing a 
disturbance,'' Kaminsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sergeant said he had no other details on the disturbance.  
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, 38, was booked for investigation of public intoxication,  
a misdemeanor. Sometime before his Oct. 1 arraignment date, 
prosecutors will decide whether to file any formal charge, Kaminsky 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman played for the Detroit Pistons, San Antonio Spurs and  
Chicago Bulls before joining the Los Angeles Lakers for a brief 
stint last season. The Lakers waived him in April.

<HEADLINE> Gates Has Wealthiest Foundation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft founder Bill Gates, the world's  
richest man, has created the country's wealthiest foundation, 
according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates and his wife, Melinda, have consolidated their two  
charitable foundations and donated an additional $6 billion to the 
newly named Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, bringing its total 
worth to $17.1 billion, according to a report published on the 
Chronicle's Web site Sunday and confirmed by a co-chair of the 
Gates Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple decided to merge the William H. Gates Foundation,  
named after Gates' father, and the Gates Learning Foundation so 
they could broaden their focus on learning and global health, said 
Patty Stonesifer, foundation co-chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
	The move catapults the Seattle-based foundation to the top of  
the Chronicle's list of wealthiest charitble foundations, the 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report names the David and Lucile Packard Foundation as the  
second wealthiest, with assets of $13 billion. The Ford Foundation, 
which is worth $11.4 billion, is third. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gates Foundation isn't the biggest in the world -- at least  
not yet. 
</P>
<P>
	That title currently belongs to the London-based Wellcome Trust,  
which has assets of $19.2 billion, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Chronicle reports that the Gates Foundation could soon  
climb to the top of the global list if the charity's namesakes keep 
on giving. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill and Melinda have made a gift of about $5 billion every  
quarter,'' said Stonesifer. While she would not say whether the 
couple plans to make another gift of similar size before year's 
end, she said she expects that the general pattern of giving ``will 
continue.''

<HEADLINE> Orioles Lose Two Pitchers to Injury </HEADLINE>

<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles had two pitchers leave  
the game with injuries Sunday during their game against the Chicago 
White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	Starter Mike Mussina left in the third inning after being hit in  
the right shoulder by a line drive off the bat of Brook Fordyce. He 
tried to throw, but experienced discomfort and could not continue. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury was diagnosed as a bruise and X-rays were negative.  
</P>
<P>
	Mussina threw 32 pitches, 22 of them strikes. He will  
re-evalutated before his next scheduled start. 
</P>
<P>
	Mussina's replacement, left-hander Arthur Rhodes, left the game  
in the fourth inning after tumbling from the mound in an effort to 
field a grounder by Chris Singleton. He hurt the index finger of 
his left hand and, like Mussina, left after taking a few practice 
throws from the mound. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Kurdish Faction Declares Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- One of the two Kurdish factions dominating  
northern Iraq declared its head as leader of Iraq's Kurdish region, 
the group said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan controls only part of the  
autonomous Kurdish zone, and its unilateral anointment of Jalal 
Talabani as ``leader of the Kurdish liberation movement'' was sure 
to upset his rival, Masoud Barzani. 
</P>
<P>
	The PUK announced its move in a statement received by The  
Associated Press in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
	Barzani's Kurdistan Democratic Party controls around two-thirds  
of northern Iraq, and Barzani considers himself of the country's 
3.5 million Kurds. Talabani holds the rest of the area. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has been trying to reconcile the bitter rivals  
in hopes of unifying them against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. 
The two parties last met with U.S. mediators in June. 
</P>
<P>
	But the two factions have focused mostly on fighting each other.  
They agreed in 1992 that an elected parliament should choose a 
governor for the region, but the rivalry has delayed the move. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, they have separate administrations and separate  
Cabinets, each running day-to-day affairs in their own part of the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kurdish groups are protected by U.S. warplanes that patrol  
the skies over northern Iraq. The Kurdish enclave is expected to be 
used as a springboard in any effort to get rid of Saddam.

Brownsville and about 100 miles south-southeast of Corpus Christi, 
the National Hurricane Center said. After heading northward

<HEADLINE> IMF: Thai Growth To Pick Up 4 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund has  
predicted that Thailand's economic growth will reach 3 percent to 4 
percent this year, and could go as high as 5 percent in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Such growth would confirm a leap out of the Asian economic  
crisis Thailand triggered two years ago, when it floated its 
currency, the baht. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranjit Teja, chief of an IMF mission from Washington, spoke to  
reporters Friday after concluding a quarterly review of Thailand's 
performance under a $17.2 billion bailout package the IMF arranged 
in 1997 to reverse the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the economy shrank 8 percent overall last year, Ranjit  
said that recovery had been settling in since the end of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Thailand has withdrawn about $14 billion in credit, and another  
$500 million will become available by October. Ranjit said the Thai 
government may decide not to withdraw the funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as they are in compliance, they can withdraw it,''  
Ranjit said. But he added, ``Clearly the needs have diminished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thailand's foreign reserves stood at $31.9 billion as of Aug.  
13. At the depths of the crisis, they had gone from $25 billion to 
nearly zero. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has made gradual progress in restructuring the  
financial sector, though non-performing loans still account for a 
whopping 47 percent of total lending in the financial system. 
</P>
<P>
	Economic recovery so far has been driven by consumption and  
renewed growth in exports. More fiscal stimulus -- the government 
has already implemented two rounds of tax cuts this year -- may be 
needed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thailand's prospects are good, even if the U.S. economy begins  
to slow, the official said. Southeast Asia and Japan are bigger 
export markets for Thailand than the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	What is needed now are continuous efforts to restructure  
thousands of struggling companies and their debts, Ranjit said. 
</P>
<P>
	But while daily change may seem tortuously slow, the officials  
noted that the overall progress made by the government in 
implementing IMF-backed reforms has dramatically changed sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
	Reserves have been rebuilt, the baht stabilized, 56 failed  
finance companies liquidated, and six banks nationalized for merger 
and sale. Four state banks are due to be sold to the highest 
bidders by year-end.

<HEADLINE> Daschle: Democrats Firm on Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle said Sunday  
that congressional Democrats will stand firm in opposing any tax 
cut beyond $300 billion, far less than is being proposed by the 
Republican majority. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has vowed to veto a 10-year, $792 billion  
package of tax cuts that congressional Republicans approved this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle, D-S.D., argued that the GOP proposal would threaten  
Social Security and Medicare and force sharp spending cuts in a 
variety of domestic programs, including education, health care and 
crime prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked during an appearance on CNN's ``Late Edition'' whether  
$300 billion in tax cuts was a maximum amount, he replied, ``It is, 
absolutely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle cited the need to protect Social Security and Medicare,  
reduce the national debt and adequately fund other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're going to do all of that, then we don't have room for  
a tax cut of any magnitude beyond $300 billion,'' he insisted. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have argued that an expected surplus will provide  
enough money to protect the entitlement programs and still give 
substantial relief to taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said in the GOP's weekly radio  
address Saturday that the party's package would simply give money 
back ``to overtaxed American families'' and that the government is 
``taking more money from you than it needs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also have said they will protect Social Security by  
``locking up'' the Social Security surplus to ensure the money 
cannot be diverted elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, House Majority Whip Tom Delay, R-Texas, said it was  
``encouraging'' to hear Sen. John Breaux, D-La., propose Social 
Security reforms that would cut payroll taxes in exchange for a 
private retirement savings program. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLay, asked on ``Fox News Sunday'' whether he would swap a tax  
cut for such a change in the Social Security system, said, ``I'm 
open to anything. It's very encouraging to have a (Democratic) 
senator start talking about this.''

<HEADLINE> Sen. Aspirant Chafee Admits Drug Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Lincoln Chafee, a U.S. Senate candidate  
and son of a stalwart Republican, admitted Sunday that he used 
cocaine ``several times'' during his college years. 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee, the mayor of Warwick, R.I., is the only Republican  
running for the seat being vacated by his father, John Chafee, who 
is retiring from the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to the media's ``dogged'' pursuit of Republican  
presidential candidate George W. Bush's possible drug use, the 
younger Chafee decided to be forthcoming with his own cocaine use 
when asked about it during a WJAR-TV news show interview that aired 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had three choices -- lie, which was not an option, or evade  
it and receive the consequences of that, or be honest. And I chose 
to be honest,'' Chafee said from his home Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee, 46, acknowledged that the revelation could hurt his  
candidacy if voters hold him to the wholesome image of his father, 
a former Boy Scout and World War II hero. 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee said he tried cocaine several times around 1974, as a  
student at Brown University. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not something I'm proud of,'' Chafee said.  
</P>
<P>
	The race has so far has attracted U.S. Rep. Robert Weygand,  
D-R.I., former Democratic Lt. Gov. Richard Licht, and former state 
attorney general Arlene Violet, who may run as an Independent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think his personal involvement with cocaine is going to be  
between him and the voters,'' Violet said.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Trying Rice Waste as Fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OROVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- California's first attempt to turn rice  
stubble and tree trimmings into ethanol resembles a scene from 
``Back to the Future,'' when trash is dumped into Mr. Fusion at one 
end and pure energy comes out the other. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed ``bio-refinery'' will convert thousands of tons of  
rice straw, orchard prunings and other agricultural waste into 
ethanol, a sort of 200-proof moonshine that state air-pollution 
fighters hope will soon replace the unpopular additive MTBE in 
California gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see it as an efficient waste-based ethanol plant that takes  
advantage of low-cost and no-cost materials,'' said Stephen J. 
Gatto, head of Boston-based BC International Corp., which plans to 
start construction next year south of Oroville, 60 miles north of 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice farmers see it as a match made in heaven.  
</P>
<P>
	Blocked by state air regulators from burning their stubble, the  
growers disc the hardy straw back into the ground. That costs $30 
an acre, about a fourth of the growers' profits. 
</P>
<P>
	About 500,000 acres of rice are grown in the Sacramento Valley,  
producing about 1.5 million tons of rice straw. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice growers have hunted for ways to use rice straw since new  
air-quality rules took effect in 1993. House insulation, woven 
furniture and scaffolding were among the uses tried. None worked 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	Growers believe they've found the answer in ethanol.  
</P>
<P>
	``We can get this stuff off the field and at least break even.  
That's all we really want to do with the rice stubble -- break 
even,'' said Ken Collins, who farms 1,600 acres of rice near Biggs 
and plans to ship his rice straw to the new plant. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oroville factory will convert about 75,000 tons of rice  
straw, 125,000 tons of orchard slash and 40,000 tons of other 
agricultural waste into ethanol each year. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're looking at about 900 tons there,'' Collins said, as his  
workers tended to a two-story-high mound of bailed rice straw 
culled from his fields. Collins is among a group of growers who 
have formed a cooperative to feed the new plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethanol is a familiar product in the Midwest, where factories  
convert corn starch into about 1.6 billion gallons annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Illinois, South Dakota, North Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa and  
Minnesota are among states with ethanol factories, providing a 
market for the states' corn growers and a cleaner mix of fuel for 
states facing EPA air pollution-fighting mandates. 
</P>
<P>
	A bushel of corn produces about 2.5 gallons of ethanol.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're making corn whiskey, is what it amounts to. But ethanol  
is very clean. It clearly is a benefit to air quality, and it does 
add octane,'' said Trevor Guthmiller, executive director of the 
South Dakota-based American Coalition for Ethanol. 
</P>
<P>
	Midwestern ethanol growers see California -- and its more than 20  
million licensed drivers -- as a huge new market. BCI's factory, 
expected to open by 2001, won't produce enough ethanol to replace 
all 540 million gallons of MTBE burned annually in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists generally supported Gov. Gray Davis' March  
decision to phase out MTBE, or methyl tertiary butyl ether, noting 
that MTBE contamination had been reported in lakes and groundwater 
across the state. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner  
said last month the EPA would seek to reduce the use of MTBE, 
citing a threat to drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oxygenated Fuels Association, an Arlington, Va.-based trade  
association representing MTBE producers, said the compound protects 
air quality and will prove costly to replace. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the most cost-effective and cleanest source of octane,''  
said Terry Wigglesworth, the group's executive director. ``Replace 
that with something else that's not proven, and you're going to 
have all kinds of problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ethanol backers say the cost to motorists would be about the  
same in California as with MTBE. In the Midwest, ethanol has had 
little effect on pump prices, Guthmiller said. California's 
gasoline prices already are among the highest in the nation, with 
unleaded regular averaging about $1.50 a gallon recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Gatto said ethanol has uses beyond gasoline, including  
mouthwash, aftershave, perfume and solvents. 
</P>
<P>
	The Midwestern plants derive sugar from corn starch to make the  
ethanol, a relatively simple process. In Brazil, ethanol is made 
using cane sugar. 
</P>
<P>
	BCI's plant, expected to open by 2001, will use new technology  
to separate cellulose from the ``biomass'' -- wood, straw, leaves, 
fruit pits and other items -- and use that sugar to make the 
ethanol. 
</P>
<P>
	The California Energy Commission is studying the use of ethanol  
and other compounds as fuel additives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, the technology is there and it's not that difficult  
to produce ethanol through the conversion process,'' commission 
spokeswoman Claudia Chandler said. ``The question is, `Is it 
economical and is there a market for it?''' 
</P>
<P>
	The BCI operation will produce about 22 million gallons of  
ethanol a year, or roughly 70 to 100 gallons per ton of biomass. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins and others believe it's just a start.  
</P>
<P>
	``We could use all our rice straw and all our orchard prunings,  
and we'd still hardly sustain the demand,'' Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar biomass ethanol plant, also run by BCI, has begun  
operation in Jennings, La. It produces about 22 million gallons 
annually. That plant cost about $90 million, and the Oroville 
facility is expected to cost about the same, Gatto said.

<HEADLINE> Europe Picks Ryder Cup Team  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- Padraig Harrington of Ireland played his  
way onto his first Ryder Cup team Sunday, and captain Mark James 
gave Europe a truly green look by selecting Andrew Coltart as one 
his two captain's picks. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrington finished second behind Colin Montgomerie in the BMW  
International Open and moved up to 10th in the Ryder Cup standings, 
nudging out Robert Karlsson. James then rounded off the team with 
Jesper Parnevik and Coltart, a Scotsman who has never played in the 
matches and who has only one victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coltart has played more consistently since the U.S. Open than  
any of the other candidates,'' James said. ``He's shown the most, 
and he's one of the Top 20 players in the world. It was a very 
difficult choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Nick Faldo and the rest of Europe's old guard watching from  
home for the first time in 24 years, James will bring one of the 
most inexperienced teams over to The Country Club outside Boston 
next month as Europe tries to retain the Ryder Cup once again. 
</P>
<P>
	Faldo, Bernard Langer, Ian Woosnam, Seve Ballesteros and Sandy  
Lyle were regarded as the ``Fab Five'' in Europe -- at least one of 
them as played in every Ryder Cup since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, they have been replaced by a new generation.  
</P>
<P>
	Seven Europeans have never experienced a Ryder Cup -- Coltart,  
Harrington, Sergio Garcia, British Open champion Paul Lawrie, Jean 
Van de Velde, Miguel Angel Jimenez and Jarmo Sandelin. Three others 
-- Parnevik, Lee Westwood and Darren Clarke -- have played in only 
one Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The experience will come from Masters champion Jose Maria  
Olazabal, playing on his fifth team, and Montgomerie, who will be 
on his fourth team. Garcia, the 19-year-old Spaniard who finished 
second in the PGA Championship behind Tiger Woods, is the youngest 
player in Ryder Cup history. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team, which captain Ben Crenshaw completed last week  
after the PGA Championship, has only one rookie -- David Duval. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's an excellent team,'' James said. ``I think it's  
balanced and I think we have a good mix of different types of 
players and personalities. I'm confident we can win, because it 
doesn't matter who was there before. It's the standard of players 
we have this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Europe has won or retained the Ryder Cup five times in the past  
seven matches, although the Americans have been heavily favored 
each time. 
</P>
<P>
	James was thought to be leaning toward experience, but chose  
Coltart over Langer and Woosnam. He had told Faldo, who has played 
on every Ryder Cup team since 1977, that he would not make this 
one. 
</P>
<P>
	``I bumped into Mark in the hotel last night and asked him -- he  
said I was too far down the ladder,'' said a dejected Faldo, who 
had openly campaigned to make the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomerie had hoped Faldo would be included.  
</P>
<P>
	``The team that plays in Brookline will be weaker without  
Nick,'' Montgomerie said. ``I would pick him, yes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomerie closed with a 70 for a 20-under 268 to win the BMW  
International by three strokes over Harrington, who shot a 72. 
Harrington needed to finish in the top two to make the Ryder Cup 
team, and made a 9-foot putt on the last hole to finish a stroke 
ahead of Jarrod Mosely for second. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll sink in tomorrow what I've done,'' said an overjoyed  
Harrington. ``I won't sleep tonight -- I didn't sleep yesterday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Europe's 12 players are all expected to be at Firestone Country  
Club in Akron, Ohio, this week for the $5 million NEC Invitational, 
a World Golf Championship event for players on the Ryder Cup and 
Presidents Cup teams.

<HEADLINE>  Relief Agency Readies for Hurricane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hurricane Bret has the ``clear potential of  
producing a major disaster,'' possibly more destructive than 
Hurricane Andrew in 1992, the National Weather Service declared 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A vital difference between Bret and Andrew, the service's Jim  
Hoke said, is that the hurricane bearing down on the Texas east 
coast is moving much slower while carrying the same 140 mph winds. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoke appeared with officials of the Federal Emergency Management  
Agency to discuss preparations for the expected afternoon or 
evening landfall. 
</P>
<P>
	FEMA's director of response and recovery operations, Bruce  
Bahghman, said the agency has prepared four emergency medical and 
relief teams for deployment once the location of Bret's landfall is 
certain. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoke said a tornado watch was to be issued Sunday afternoon on  
the south Texas coast to warn against twisters Bret was likely to 
spawn as it closed in between Corpus Christi and Brownsville. The 
area already was under a hurricane warning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hurricane Bret has the clear potential of producing a major  
disaster,'' Hoke said. ``It has the ingredients to threaten life 
and property in many ways. These ways include storm surge, flooding 
from rains, high winds and tornadoes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the biggest worry of emergency workers is that barrier  
islands and low-lying coastal areas will be inundated by a storm 
surge of 10-15 feet.

<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- With his envoys about to head to Washington,  
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat urged the United States today to 
step in to break the latest deadlock in the peace process with 
Israel. Arafat's call was quickly rejected by the administration of 
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who last month won assurances 
from President Clinton that Washington would avoid the direct role 
it has taken in the past. In a series of direct talks, Israeli and 
Palestinian negotiators have been unable to work out how to 
implement the Wye peace deal brokered by President Clinton in 
October.

<HEADLINE> Probation, Parole Numbers Top 4M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans on probation or parole  
has topped 4 million for the first time, the Bureau of Justice 
Statistics said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the overall increase masked some sharp changes among the  
states. 
</P>
<P>
	There were large declines in the number of adults on parole in  
several states including Virginia, down 37 percent, and North 
Carolina, which registered a 30 percent drop. Parole is a period of 
supervision following release from prison. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the number of parolees in Ohio increased 66  
percent and in Idaho the figure jumped 55 percent, according to the 
bureau's report. 
</P>
<P>
	A change in Ohio law contributed to its increase, said Thomas P.  
Bonczar, a bureau statistician. ``A lot of states are passing 
mandatory parole,'' he explained. 
</P>
<P>
	But at the same time, the increase in the number of parolees was  
balanced by states that have toughened their laws to keep offenders 
in prison longer. 
</P>
<P>
	The national prison release rate declined from 37 per 100  
prisoners in 1990 to 31 in 1997 while average time served increased 
from 22 months in 1990 to 27 months in 1997, Bonczar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, 704,964 people were on parole at the end of 1998, up  
from 694,787 in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Turning to probation, more than 3.4 million adults were serving  
a period of correctional supervision in their communities at the 
end of 1998, up from nearly 3.3 million people in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Idaho and Vermont each reported a 21 percent increase in their  
probation populations, the largest among the states, while 11 
states reported declines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have less information on what's happening with probation,''  
Bonczar said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he noted that while violent crime has declined in recent  
years, there have been increases in drug abuse violations and 
convictions for fraud and forgery, which tend to be the types of 
crimes for which people are sentenced to probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 96 percent of parolees had been convicted of a felony. More  
than half, or 57 percent, of those on probation had committed a 
felony, 40 percent were convicted of misdemeanors and the rest 
found guilty of other infractions. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 parolee population was 55 percent white, 44 percent  
black, 21 percent Hispanic and 88 percent male. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, in 1990, 52 percent of parolees were white, 47  
percent were black, 18 percent were Hispanic and 92 percent were 
men. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those on probation, 79 percent were male, down from 82  
percent in 1990. Whites made up 64 percent of probationers, down 
from 68 percent, while the share of blacks grew from 31 percent to 
35 percent. Hispanics made up 15 percent of probationers, down from 
18 percent in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Prognosis Good for Bengals' Moore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- For the second time in three years, the  
Cincinnati Bengals are handling the tough emotions that come with 
having a player hospitalized with a serious neck injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Safety Kelvin Moore was in stable condition Sunday at a hospital  
in Pontiac, Mich., two days after he broke a vertebra in his neck 
while making a tackle in a preseason game against the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore has feeling in his arms and legs and is expected to make  
``an excellent recovery,'' team Dr. Robert Heidt Jr. said. There's 
no way to tell whether the 24-year-old Moore will ever play again. 
</P>
<P>
	After watching film of the play, coach Bruce Coslet said Moore  
did everything right and still got hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked like he was a little bit stumbling into him and just  
bent his head back,'' Coslet said. ``It just happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It brought back memories of how offensive lineman Scott  
Brumfield was hurt on Nov. 3, 1996 in a game in Baltimore. 
Brumfield banged heads with teammate Troy Sadowski and was 
temporarily paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
	Brumfield made a full recovery from a spinal cord concussion and  
played for the Bengals in 1997, appearing in 15 games and starting 
three. He partially tore an anterior cruciate ligament in his knee 
early in training camp in 1998 and agreed to an injury settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore's injury also brought back memories for Detroit fans.  
Former Lions Mike Utley and Reggie Brown suffered severe neck 
injuries this decade and had to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``With these powerful athletes flying around and the collisions  
they generate, sometimes you wonder why there's not more of them,'' 
Coslet said. ``But when it happens, it's devastating. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's part of the game, and injury always has been part of the  
game. When it becomes career-ending or life-threatening or whatever 
other adjective you want to use, it puts things in perspective 
quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coslet, general manager Mike Brown and a couple of coaches  
briefly visited Moore in Pontiac Osteopathic Hospital after Friday 
night's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was pretty much out of it, but I think he recognized who  
was in there,'' Coslet said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore will be transferred to USC University Hospital in Los  
Angeles, near his family's home, in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore was on the Bengals' practice squad for most of last  
season, after he signed as a rookie free agent. He was in line to 
be part of the Bengals' special teams this season and play as an 
extra defensive back on passing downs. 
</P>
<P>
	His injury came one week after cornerback Ric Mathias hurt his  
knee, ending his season. Defensive back Tremain Mack was suspended 
for four games by the NFL on Friday for his alcohol-related 
arrests, further depleting the position. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to say, 'Hey, we can't let this affect us,' and  
that's tough to do right now,'' Coslet said. ``But you've got to go 
on.''

<HEADLINE> Ventura Returns to Wrestling Roots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- After weeks of controversy and a court  
battle, Gov. Jesse Ventura was scheduled to get back in the ring 
Sunday -- becoming the first governor, and possibly the first 
elected American official, to serve as a referee at a professional 
wrestling event. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, the loudmouthed bad boy who used to taunt fans and  
trick opponents as ``The Body,'' was to oversee the main event at 
the World Wrestling Federation's SummerSlam -- the ``Triple Threat'' 
title match between Stone Cold Steve Austin, Mankind and Triple H. 
</P>
<P>
	The WWF is hoping that the crossover of roles will draw new fans  
as the organization competes for ratings with the rival World 
Championship Wrestling, owned by media mogul Ted Turner. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor's critics have fought to keep him from  
participating in the extravaganza, arguing that he is abusing and 
degrading his office. 
</P>
<P>
	A county judge this week refused to grant a temporary  
restraining order sought by environmental activist Leslie Davis, a 
write-in candidate for governor, to prevent Ventura from 
refereeing. Common Cause Minnesota, a campaign watchdog group, also 
filed a complaint alleging a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	David Olson, Ventura's attorney, said the appearance is  
independent of his gubernatorial position. 
</P>
<P>
	``The agreement is for him to appear as Jesse `The Body'  
Ventura,'' Olson said. ``He's not appearing as the governor of the 
state of Minnesota. He has not been referred to as `the governor' 
and he will not be referred to as `the governor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The question of money has also been a sore point with critics.  
</P>
<P>
	Many have speculated that his take from SummerSlam -- the  
pay-per-view event that brings the WWF $29.95 per subscriber -- 
could reach seven figures. Wrestling experts say he is likely to 
receive at least $1 million in video royalties and the use of his 
trademarked name. 
</P>
<P>
	While Ventura has repeatedly declined to say how much money  
he'll pocket from his appearance, he has promised donate to charity 
his $100,000 referee fee. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's appearance marks the second time Ventura, who retired

<HEADLINE> Lindo Plays Justice Clarence Thomas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a new biographical film, Delroy Lindo bent  
over backward to give Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas the 
benefit of the doubt. He's not sure audiences will do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	In the upcoming cable movie, ``Strange Justice,'' Lindo said  
fairness was his supreme goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The film deals with Thomas' Senate confirmation hearings in  
1991, which became controversial when former Thomas employee Anita 
Hill accused the judge of sexual harassment. Thomas was eventually 
confirmed by a narrow margin. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to play devil's advocate for Judge Thomas,'' Lindo  
says in Sunday's Daily News. ``I attempted to put myself in his 
place and develop a rationale for what he said and did. Despite my 
best efforts, I think the film comes out in favor of Anita Hill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lindo, 46, has feature film credits including ``Get Shorty,''  
``Ransom'' and ``A Life Less Ordinary.''

<HEADLINE> Jamaican Carmaker Rolls Out First </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) -- A fledgling Jamaican carmaker has  
rolled out its first model -- a light sports utility vehicle named 
the Island Cruzer. 
</P>
<P>
	The carmaker, Excel Motors, unveiled the first production model  
Friday at its plant in western Savanna-la-Mar. The company will 
build five Island Cruzers a week and sell them for $9,500 each, 
Excel Owner Patrick Marzouca said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marzouca said he is trying to market the car to local car rental  
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The vehicle sports a 1.5-liter Japanese engine. The chassis was  
developed by a Canadian company, but the rest of the car was 
designed by Jamaicans, Marzouca said.

<HEADLINE> Orioles Lose Two Pitchers to Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles had two pitchers leave  
the game with injuries Sunday during their game against the Chicago 
White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	Starter Mike Mussina left in the third inning after being hit in  
the right shoulder by a line drive off the bat of Brook Fordyce. He 
tried to throw, but experienced discomfort and could not continue. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury was diagnosed as a bruise and X-rays were negative.  
</P>
<P>
	Mussina threw 32 pitches, 22 of them strikes. He will  
re-evalutated before his next scheduled start. 
</P>
<P>
	Mussina's replacement, left-hander Arthur Rhodes, left the game  
in the fourth inning after tumbling from the mound in an effort to 
field a grounder by Chris Singleton. He hurt the index finger of 
his left hand and, like Mussina, left after taking a few practice 
throws from the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Johns replaced Rhodes.

<HEADLINE> Wounds Remain 10 Yrs. After Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The night held the air of youthful promise as  
16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins and his three friends embarked on a 
typical teen-age rite of passage: looking for a used car. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, it ended in violence when about 30 club-wielding white  
youths -- one with a gun -- confronted the blacks, mistakenly 
thinking they were coming to the largely white neighborhood for a 
party being thrown by one attacker's ex-girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	Shots rang out and Hawkins lay wounded on a street in the  
Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn. With his death that night on Aug. 
23, 1989, the city's oft-mended and fragile cloth of racial 
civility was torn wide open. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Howard Beach was the chip in the wall, Bensonhurst probably  
was the sledge hammer that knocked the wall down,'' said the Rev. 
Al Sharpton, referring to the fatal beating of a black man by 
another white mob in the borough of Queens three years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight people were tried for the attack. Three went to prison;  
two others were convicted but given probation; three were 
acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the gunman, Joey Fama, remains jailed. Convicted of  
second-degree murder, he is not scheduled for parole until 2022. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters who came to the neighborhood after the killing were  
met by residents shouting racial slurs. Some chanted ``useless, 
useless,'' a play on the slain Hawkins' first name. One spectator 
spat in the face of the victim's father, Moses Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you know how that felt to hear those people shouting  
'useless, useless'? It nearly tore my heart out,'' said Stewart, 
who still blames the neighborhood for silently supporting his son's 
attackers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bensonhurst, once a stronghold for Italian immigrants, now has a  
much more diverse flavor. Chinese, Korean and Russian stores dot a 
main drag, and hundreds of Mexican immigrants gather each morning, 
hoping to get day jobs in construction and gardening. 
</P>
<P>
	At St. Dominic's Roman Catholic Church, the Rev. Italo Barozzi  
said the neighborhood would rather forget the incident and the 
dozens of marches it set off. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was shocking to the people. They don't expect that here,''  
Barozzi said. ``But all those marches? We must solve problems in a 
better way. What, after all, is the importance of a march? What are 
you protesting?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the killing spurred political change.  
</P>
<P>
	It helped create an activist movement that was recently revived  
with the police killing of unarmed black immigrant Amadou Diallo in 
a hail of 41 bullets. It also catapulted Manhattan Borough 
President David Dinkins to victory in that year's Democratic 
mayoral primary. He became the city's first black mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	``David Dinkins walked into City Hall over the body of Yusuf  
Hawkins,'' said Hawkins' father, his voice tinged with both pride 
and sadness. 
</P>
<P>
	The night of the slaying began innocently enough. Hawkins and  
three friends went by subway to Bensonhurst to look at a used 1983 
Pontiac. After stopping to buy candy, they were suddenly surrounded 
near the house of Gina Feliciano, who had angered a neighborhood 
youth, Keith Mondello, by asking some black and Latino teen-agers 
to a party. 
</P>
<P>
	Mondello had vowed to keep minorities out of the neighborhood.  
He and the others had spent the day drinking beer and smoking 
marijuana, then gathered up baseball bats, golf clubs and sticks. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart said his son and the others never understood what was  
happening. Shots rang out and Hawkins fell, still clutching a candy 
bar. None of the other black teens was seriously hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Thinking back on that night, Stewart remembers the new pants,  
shirt and shoes he had bought his son -- a B-plus student with 
dreams of being an engineer. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I came back from the hospital after seeing my son lying  
so still, like he was sleeping, I saw the clothes hanging in the 
closet,'' Stewart said. ``I was waiting for him to come home to 
give them to him, but he never came home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Mondello asked Stewart's forgiveness after serving  
eight years in prison. But Stewart said the meeting could not mend 
his hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a nice gesture, but I told him up front that I am in no  
position to offer forgiveness -- that's God's job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mondello, now a college student, could not be reached for his  
thoughts on the case. Stewart, a former truck driver who now works 
with Sharpton fighting bias, said the killing changed his life. 
</P>
<P>
	His relationship with his longtime sweetheart, Diane Hawkins,  
ended three years after Yusuf's death. Ms. Hawkins has never spoken 
of the shooting. Their younger son, disgusted with New York, has 
moved away; a third son is reclusive. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he has managed to find peace in the decade since the  
slaying, Stewart replied: 
</P>
<P>
	``It depends on what you call peace. Can I sleep at night a  
little better? Yes. Has some of the rage in me calmed? Yes. As far 
as me being peaceful about the racial overtones -- no. I am still 
just as up in arms as the day after my son died.''

<HEADLINE> Gold-Medalist Dragila Wants Respect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- More respect and more money.  
</P>
<P>
	That's what world champion Stacy Dragila wants for women's pole  
vaulting. 
</P>
<P>
	For winning the gold medal Saturday -- the first time the  
relatively new event has been held at the outdoor World 
Championships -- the 28-year-old American got $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
	That's half of what the winners of get for all but one other  
event -- the equally new women's hammer throw. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Amateur Athletic Federation says the two  
events will get equal prize money after they've been contested at 
three championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate,'' said Dragila, who has tried rodeo,  
hurdling and heptathlons. ``We're trying to get the event 
established. Are you going to go to the Olympics and get half a 
gold medal? 
</P>
<P>
	``That just doesn't seem right. If you're going to have it in  
the World Championships, I think it should be a full-fledged event. 
Obviously, I think women's pole vaulting has taken its place in 
history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dragila, of Pocatello, Idaho, has been a thick chapter in the  
story. She smiles almost constantly, is known for cheering on her 
opponents and calls the event ``family oriented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``To have that ego and be real tense just doesn't seem like fun  
to me,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She won the gold with a vault of 15-feet, 1 inch, matching the  
world outdoor record of Australian Emma George, but failed to set a 
new mark with three misses at 15-3. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the pioneers in the event, Dragila also won the world  
indoor title earlier this year in Japan and also once shared the 
world indoor mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Will she ever hold a world record outright?  
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, I think so. That day is coming, for sure,'' she said  
Sunday as she prepared for a holiday -- probably on a beach in 
southern Portugal -- with her husband, Brent. ``We just want to get 
away and enjoy the moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dragila lost almost a year of competition to a mysterious foot  
injury that was misdiagnosed for months. When she no-heighted at 
the Goodwill Games a year ago, she was persuaded to have a bone 
scan, which revealed a stress fracture in her right foot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd wake up in the morning and I couldn't even step on my  
foot,'' she said. ``I knew something wasn't right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dragila had surgery in September and by February she was back  
vaulting, and better than ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been doing great all season so this is just the  
culmination,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	How high can the women go?  
</P>
<P>
	``I think the 5-meter (16-4 3/4) level is going to be a little like  
the 6-meter (19-8 1/4) jump for men,'' Dragila said. ``It might take a 
little longer than 2000, but I think it's in the near future for me 
and at least four other women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know where our heights are going to go. People  
thought 14 feet was our max just a few years ago, and now we're way 
beyond that.''

<HEADLINE> Australia To Keep Queen on Coins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Despite reports to the contrary, the  
government said Sunday it has no plans to remove the image of Queen 
Elizabeth II from its coins if Australia votes to become an 
independent republic in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia has been independent since 1901, but like many  
Commonwealth nations it still recognizes the British monarch as its 
head of state. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's 11.6 million voters will be asked in a referendum  
on Nov. 6 whether they want to drop the queen, a holdover from 
Australia's day as a British colony, and become an independent 
republic. 
</P>
<P>
	News reports had said that becoming a republic would require the  
queen's head to be taken off Australia's coins and replaced with 
the image of notable public figures, such as cricket legend Sir 
Donald Bradman. 
</P>
<P>
	But Finance Minister Joe Hockey said that would not happen.  
</P>
<P>
	``Even if Australia does become a republic, we would have to  
have good reasons to remove the queen from our coinage,'' he said. 
``Australians have a deep affinity with her majesty the queen. She 
has been a part of our coinage since we first started to print in 
Australia.''

<HEADLINE> Clintons Focus on Senate Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- President Clinton and his wife, Hillary,  
concentrated Sunday on the very un-vacation-like duty of raising 
money for her possible Senate campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	About 250 guests walked up a gravel drive to the home of Viacom  
executive Frank Biondi and his wife, Carol, in the Katama section 
of Edgartown to pledge support if Mrs. Clinton finally decides to 
run for the U.S. Senate from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a fourth consecutive day of social activity for Clinton,  
who ventured out alone Saturday night to dinner at a friend's home. 
He planned dinner with friends again Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons often attend church while on Martha's Vineyard, but  
skipped services Sunday in anticipation of the late morning brunch, 
which raised $1,000 per ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady's fund-raiser was closed to the press, and with  
their watchful eyes out of the room, the president picked up a 
spare saxophone and joined Resonance, a high school jazz band 
providing the entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	He belted out a jazzy ``My Funny Valentine'' to honor an  
unidentified couple celebrating their 35th wedding anniversary. He 
did not speak to the crowd -- unlike at his first fund-raiser for 
his wife Friday night, when he talked sweetly of their meeting in 
law school and his feeble attempts to avoid falling in love with 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is her event,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.  
``He's just here to attend and see some friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The guest list included a few of the Clintons' posse of Vineyard  
friends: Vernon Jordan, Steven Rattner, Dick Ebersol, Maurice 
Tempelsman. Also attending were humor columnist Art Buchwald, 
lawyer Alan Dershowitz, and Mrs. Clinton's former spokeswoman, Lisa 
Caputo. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, the Clintons journeyed to a restaurant in nearby Oak  
Bluffs to a birthday celebration for longtime aide Kelly Craighead. 
Cheers erupted from a gaggle of onlookers as Clinton emerged from 
his bronze sport utility vehicle. He waved and strode over to shake 
hands with a few people in the doorway of the Vineyard Sanctum 
health store. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Schilling, 35, owner of the C'est La Vie shop nearby,  
handed Clinton a bag containing a polo shirt and a hat from his 
store. ``This is for you, sir,'' Schilling said in a mild French 
accent. Then he pumped his fist and said ``All right! I did it!'' 
He said he'd waited a long time to give the president a gift from 
his store. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a pleasure to have him here on the island,'' Schilling  
said. ``Cool, cool, cool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton shook hands among the crowd that built up while he was  
at the birthday celebration. Mrs. Clinton emerged from the 
restaurant just as he finished pressing the flesh. She shook a few 
hands before their motorcade sped back to the vacation compound. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Lockhart said Clinton was being briefed Sunday on the  
Federal Emergency Management Agency's preparations for Hurricane 
Bret's landfall in Texas. FEMA Director James Lee Witt briefed the 
president on the situation Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Furlough Wins Ballerina by a Nose </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- Furlough overtook Bourbon Belle in  
the final stride Sunday and won the $200,000 Grade II Ballerina 
Handicap at Saratoga by a nose. 
</P>
<P>
	An upset seemed likely at the start of the race for fillies and  
mares 3 and up when Catinca, the favorite, left the gate clumsily 
and was only to recover to finish in a dead-heat for third. 
</P>
<P>
	Bourbon Belle led the field of 10 until that final stride when  
Mike Smith got Furlough in front to give trainer Shug McGaughey his 
fifth Ballerina winner and first in five years. 
</P>
<P>
	McGaughey's previous winners in the race were Lass Trump (1984);  
Cadillacing (1988); Queena (1991); and Roamin Rachel (1994). 
</P>
<P>
	Furlough carried 114 pounds and earned $120,000 for Ogden Phipps  
with her second win in seven starts this year. She covered seven 
furlongs in 1:23 on a fast track. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a measure of Catinca's class and gameness that, despite  
her catastrophic start, she came from far back while racing widest 
to finish third with Hurricane Bertie. 
</P>
<P>
	The order of finish was completed by License Fee, Marley Vale,  
Harpia, Sapphire n'Silk, Countess Diana and Anklet. 
</P>
<P>
	John Kimmel, Catinca's trainer, had been openly optimistic about  
his filly's prospects going into the race. He made no effort to 
mask his anger and disappointment afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't go 15 wide and get left at the gate,'' he said. ``I  
don't know if she got left or if she stumbled. It was the trip from 
hell. (Jockey) Jerry (Bailey) said she was standing fine in the 
gate and then got a little edgy. She threw her head around. She was 
standing OK at the break. When she broke, she broke out from 
underneath him and she went to her knees. I have to watch the 
replay; it's hard for me to tell what happened through my 
binoculars. It was very unfortunate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Furlough returned $16.40, $8 and $3.20. Bourbon Belle paid  
$11.20 and $3.70. Catinca was $2.20 and Hurricane Bertie $2.70 in 
the dead-heat for show.

<HEADLINE> Mexico's Seaside Residents Remain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLAYA BAGDAD, Mexico (AP) -- The wind pulled angrily at his door,  
rain leaked through four different holes in his roof, and waves 
smashed ever closer to his front stairs. No matter. Jose Loera held 
on. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite initial warnings that Hurricane Bret could sweep in from  
the Gulf, destroying homes, flooding low-lying areas and 
threatening lives, the 69-year-old businessman said Sunday he could 
not afford to walk away. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is everything I own. This is my life,'' Loera said while  
standing on the wind-whipped porch of ``Super Paty,'' his 
combination snack bar-home on the beach of this fishing village and 
tourist resort. 
</P>
<P>
	Loera estimated that about 30 people had stayed behind to guard  
more than a dozen seaside businesses -- mostly small, wooden 
structures built on stilts. 
</P>
<P>
	All together, 4,200 evacuees were taken to three shelters in  
Matamoros, according to Roberto Chavez, Red Cross disaster 
coordinator for the state. Some 1,200 people were evacuated in the 
coastal village of San Fernando, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Inland to the west, authorities were bracing for flooding along  
the Rio Grande: 16 shelters were being set up in Nuevo Laredo and 
people in 12 riverside towns were being evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Bret turned toward the northwest Sunday and made  
landfall later in the day in southern Texas. It delivered little 
more than strong winds and warm rain to Mexico's northern Gulf 
Coast. Minor flooding was still possible in Matamoros. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hundred yards down the beach from Loera's business,  
giddy tourists from the northern city of Monterrey, who had been 
escorted past an army blockade by local police, spilled out of a 
large bus and ran toward the violent ocean waves. 
</P>
<P>
	Young children, teen-agers and toddler-carrying mothers -- all  
dressed in shorts and T-shirts -- wandered through the sand 
collecting shells or stood pointing their faces into a 
salt-drenched wind, happily absorbing the pelting rain. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is our first time seeing the ocean,'' said a grinning  
19-year-old Jose Manuel Guerra Rodriguez. ``It's immense and 
strong.''

<HEADLINE> Turkey Mobilizes To Help Homeless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YALOVA, Turkey (AP) -- Dressed in a headscarf and long, flowered  
dress, Kadriye Kocyigit stood patiently in line Sunday for nearly 
two hours in the hot sun, waiting for a handout of food from the 
back of a truck. 
</P>
<P>
	As she neared the front, tempers flared, jostling increased --  
and supplies were almost gone. But she stayed calm. ``My sister 
came from Ankara to help me, and she's a psychologist,'' Kocyigit 
explained. ``She's helping me handle this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five days after Turkey's quake, authorities have begun to  
address the needs of hundreds of thousands of people forced from 
their homes. Tent cities are popping up in hard-hit areas, 
volunteers and donations of food, water and other supplies are 
pouring in from across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	But getting the aid to the people who need it most is turning  
out to be a major logistical problem, and complaints about uneven 
distribution and people grabbing what they can get -- whether they 
need it or not -- are mounting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing's open, so this is the only place you can get food,''  
said Emrullah Ozturk, 56, as he watched police and soldiers try to 
control the mayhem at the front of the supply truck. ``Help is 
coming from all over Turkey but the organization here is not good 
at all. Some people get too much, others not enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trucks handing out everything from butane camp stoves to  
diapers, tampons and soap were parked at the entrance to Ataturk 
Central Research Institute for Agriculture and Horticulture, a 
complex of low-slung research buildings and greenhouses with a 
botanical garden in front. 
</P>
<P>
	``Agriculture is the basis of our economy,'' reads a quote from  
Ataturk, founder of modern Turkey, on the side of one building. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,300 tepee-style tents with the logo of Turkey's Red  
Crescent society were set up Saturday on the manicured grounds, 
among the trees and flowers identified in Turkish and Latin and 
artificial ponds with water lilies. But there were only 10 portable 
toilets for 5,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people setting up Sunday had lost everything, like the  
Kanber family, led by 84-year-old Ali Kanber, bone-thin and 
squinting behind thick glasses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen bad things in my life, but never as bad as this,''  
he said, sitting in the shade on a plastic chair while his two sons 
struggled to set up the tent. 
</P>
<P>
	Their house didn't collapse, but lurched to one side. They ran  
out as soon as the earth stopped shaking, and now it's too 
dangerous to go back. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have anything left,'' Kanber said. ``We're waiting  
for help from the government. If they tell us to wait 15 days or 
two months, we'll wait. We have no choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the 5,000 people in the tent city have homes to go back  
to, but are waiting for inspectors to check for cracks and give 
them the all-clear to return. Hundreds of aftershocks have rattled 
structures since last week's temblor. 
</P>
<P>
	Some have brought mattresses, furniture and portable stereos to  
make the tents more comfortable. A few have draped ropes between 
tents to hang laundry, giving the camp a sense of permanence. 
</P>
<P>
	Yasar Gulciftci, 51, his wife and son have been sleeping in the  
family's red four-door car since the quake, waiting for word that 
their house, with some cracks, is OK. 
</P>
<P>
	Gulciftci, who has lived in Yalova all his life, watched the mob  
scene at the supply truck with some disgust. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see people that I know -- who don't need anything -- but they  
get in line and keep coming back and coming back,'' he said. 
``Meanwhile, there was a man here who lost five people in his 
family and he never asked for food because he could only think 
about the people he lost. I made some food for him, otherwise he 
wouldn't have eaten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kocyigit, 37, and her 32-year-old sister, Fatma Yildirim, came  
to the truck after hearing about the distribution on the radio. 
After waiting for hours, they ended up with three packs of black 
olives, a bag of lentils and a bag of sugar. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no choice,'' she said, struggling to maintain her  
placid state. ``There was nothing else left.''

<HEADLINE> Welfare Changes Not Helping Poorest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Welfare reform has driven the poorest families  
deeper into poverty, while slightly raising the incomes of those 
who are a little better off, say researchers who hope to broaden 
the debate over what constitutes success. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest problem, opposing camps agree, is that many families  
leaving welfare are not getting food stamps although they remain 
eligible. In 1995, 88 percent of poor kids received food stamps. By 
last year, it had fallen to 70 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The conventional wisdom here in Washington is that welfare  
reform is an unqualified success because caseload reductions have 
been so dramatic,'' said Wendell Primus, a researcher at the 
liberal-leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, which was 
releasing the report Sunday. Welfare caseloads have been cut nearly 
in half since peaking in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not saying in this report that welfare reform is  
terrible. We're saying we have to bring more balance to what 
welfare reform is all about,'' added Primus, who resigned a top 
post with the Department of Health and Human Services to protest 
President Clinton's signing of the welfare bill three years ago 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Enthusiasts of the reforms argue that, overall, most families  
are better off. 
</P>
<P>
	``More Americans are enjoying the freedom of independence from  
the chains of welfare,'' said a statement from Rep. Bill Archer, 
R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which 
oversaw the reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, even reform backers acknowledge problems. A report from  
the Ways and Means Committee and testimony from the Clinton 
administration earlier this year acknowledged that the poor are 
losing ground, and Sunday's study is the most extensive 
documentation of these suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are people at the bottom who are worse off. We need to  
do something about that,'' said Ron Haskins, staff director for the 
committee's welfare panel, who helped write the welfare law. But he 
argued that more people are better off. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, which used Census and caseload data, examined  
families headed by single women and found their economic situations 
generally improved between 1993 and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	But over the next two years, the poorest 20 percent of these  
families lost an average of $577 per year, with incomes falling to 
$8,047 annually. Typically, these are families that left welfare 
but had not made up lost benefits with wages. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation was particularly bad for the poorest 10 percent,  
who lost an average of $814 per year. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem, both sides explained, is people who are forced off  
the rolls but haven't figured out how to support themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the old days, nobody cared about them. They just stayed on  
welfare forever,'' Haskins said. ``Now, even to stay on welfare you 
need a certain level of competence. There are things you must do. 
If not, they cut your benefits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report also examined families in the next income tier --  
those making between 75 and 112 percent of the poverty line. They 
came out ahead, but only by an average of $110 per year, bringing 
their average income up to $15,857 per year. 
</P>
<P>
	Essentially, these families were able to replace welfare with  
work and come out ahead, if only slightly, but would have fared 
better had they kept the food stamps they were entitled to. They 
lost an average of $530 in stamps between 1995 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Primus suggested that, given the strong economy, they would be  
doing even better. Haskins said the law was designed so people 
would replace welfare with work: ``The system is working exactly 
the way you drew it up on the chalkboard,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton also expressed concern about declining food  
stamp rolls. Speaking at a welfare-to-work conference in Chicago 
this month, he called it ``the only piece of troubling news in this 
whole happy scenario.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the administration has been unable to figure out why the  
rolls are falling, though some suspect families do not know they 
remain eligible for food help when they leave welfare. ``We have to 
work on that,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE>  Greene Just Misses World Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- The track was lightning fast, and so were  
Maurice Greene and Marion Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene overcame a stumbling start to win his second straight  
world title at 100 meters Sunday night, missing his world record by 
.01 seconds with a time of 9.80. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones kept the gold medal run going in her family, matching the  
victory of her husband, shot putter C.J. Hunter on Saturday, in 
winning her second consecutive women's 100 in 10.70. Her time 
equaled the sixth fastest in history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe if I didn't stumble, my time would have been  
faster,'' Greene said after halfway completing his goal of sweeping 
the 100 and 200 at the World Championships, a feat not accomplished 
in a major international championship since Carl Lewis at the 1984 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``The beginning was very shaky, but I didn't panic. I ran under  
control. I finished strong,'' he said. ``In the 100, everything you 
do takes off hundredths of a second. I wasn't trying for the world 
record. I don't try anymore. If it comes, it comes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As soon as he crossed the finish line, Greene celebrated by  
twirling his hand to the crowd. After seeing his time on the 
scoreboard, he shook his head and said, ``Damn,'' realizing how 
close he had come to matching the world record of 9.79 he set at 
Athens June 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene kneeled on the track, holding his head in his hands for  
several seconds. Then he looked up at training partner Ato Boldon 
in the stands and shouted, ``That's for you, Ato,'' before setting 
out on a victory lap with the American flag. 
</P>
<P>
	Boldon, who pulled out of the championships with an injury, and  
hurdler Larry Wade embraced Greene on the track. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach John Smith, who has molded Greene into the world's top  
sprinter, was impressed by the way his protege ran down Canada's 
Bruny Surin over the final 20 meters. Surin finished second in 
9.84, equaling the third fastest time ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``He won it coming from behind -- Carl Lewis style,'' Smith said.  
</P>
<P>
	Greene was relieved that he had won one of his toughest races.  
</P>
<P>
	``In the end I was just thinking I'm glad it's all over,'' he  
said. ``I think Bruny and I produced a great spectacle, maybe one 
of the best ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Surin blamed himself for the loss.  
</P>
<P>
	``That was very close,'' he said. ``I knew I could beat him, but  
I made a mistake. I passed him a little and panicked. I got excited 
too soon instead of staying relaxed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boldon, one of Greene's training partners, wasn't surprised at  
the comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's caught me so many times,'' said Boldon, the 1997 200  
world champion. ``When he puts his head down ... that's what 
carries him through the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew he was going to catch Bruny. Bruny has a tendency to  
put his head up. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is having the best season ever by a sprinter. He's run  
9.79, 9.80, 9.85, 9.87 and 9.91 (twice). Without the stumble, he 
would have run 9.78.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. team coach George Williams also praised Greene's effort.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought he ran a great race except for the first step,''  
Williams said. ``He stuttered. That cost him a world record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones didn't come close to a world record -- Florence Griffth  
Joyner's 10.49 -- but she did run the world's fastest time of 1999 
and broke the championship record of 10.76 she set in Saturday's 
quarterfinals. Only Jones and Griffith Joyner ever have run faster 
than 10.72 -- FloJo four times and Jones seven. 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, Jones was not the fastest out of the blocks, but she  
quickly assumed control and ran her usual powerful race, beating 
Inger Miller by just over a meter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coming off the victory by C.J. last night, I'm very excited to  
win,'' the ebullient Jones said. ``The goal for the week was to get 
five gold medals in the family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter, who began the gold rush, roared from the stands after  
his wife's victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones will have to do the rest of the family work. She is  
seeking an unprecedented four golds -- in the 100, 200, long jump 
and a relay. 
</P>
<P>
	``I nailed my start today, ...'' Jones said. ``That was perhaps  
the reason I pulled off the victory. I knew that Inger was running 
extra fast. But I put it all together and executed my race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller was jubilant over her third straight personal best after  
finishing second at 10.79. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting there,'' she said. ``Marion's a great athlete, but  
she's not the only one. She's beatable. Everybody is beatable. 
She's not invincible. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be good for our sport that a lot of us are  
stepping up and it's not just going to be -- so, what about Marion 
Jones?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, Jones will be beatable, but she hasn't lost a sprint  
race in two years. She only appears vulnerable in the long jump, 
where she has lost three times. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sunday's other finals, France's Eunice Barber won the  
heptathlon with a career-best 6,861 points and Germany's Karsten 
Kobs took the hammer throw at 263 feet, 3 inches. Kobs celebrated 
by running across the field and diving into the steeplechase water 
jump. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Michael Johnson, the three-time defending champion in  
the men's 400, eased through his opening-round heat in 45.35. 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's 1,500 semifinals, the two fastest milers in  
history, Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco and Noah Ngeny of Kenya, won 
their heats. 
</P>
<P>
	Paraskevi Tsiamita had the longest women's triple jump of the  
year, 49-5 1/2, leading the way into the final. Inessa Kravets, the 
world record-holder from Ukraine, failed to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Svetlana Masterkova of Russia and former  
champion Maria Mutola of Mozambique were the semifinal winners in 
the women's 800. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic champion Lars Riedel, seeking his fifth consecutive  
world discus title, qualified for the final, but Virgilijus Alekna 
of Lithuania, ranked No. 1 in the world last year, led the 
qualifiers at 216-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamaica's Deon Hemmings, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist, ran the  
fastest time (54.27) in the heats of the women's 400 hurdles. 
Defending champion Nezha Bidouane of Morocco also advanced to the 
semifinals.

<HEADLINE> Compaq Abandons Alpha Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Compaq Computer Corp. has abandoned efforts to  
make its advanced Alpha computer chips compatible with 32-bit 
Windows 2000, the next version of Microsoft Inc.'s NT operating 
system due out later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston-based Compaq said it has disbanded the 100-person team  
assigned to the project, and some layoffs are likely. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision in no way diminishes our commitment to Microsoft  
or Alpha,'' he said. ``Alpha is the development platform for 64-bit 
Windows NT.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company continues to work with Microsoft to develop 64-bit  
Windows NT, Compaq spokesman Jim Finlaw said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Alpha chip has been consistently faster than the competing  
Pentium chip because it's built to handle 64 bits of data at a 
time, compared to 32 bits for Pentium, The Boston Globe reported 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Alpha's 64-bit design won't run on Window's 32-bit operating  
system, including NT, without a translation program, the newspaper 
said. This translation causes Alpha to run slower, eliminating its 
advantage over Pentium. The operating system is what runs the 
computer's basic functions. 
</P>
<P>
	Finlaw said he could not confirm such a slowdown, but said the  
decision was based on customer demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not plan to support 32-bit Windows 2000 on Alpha systems  
because we're getting the power and performance customers need ... 
with 32-bit Windows NT on the Intel platform,'' he said. ``We've 
got to go where the volume is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, he said, Compaq will focus on selling its Alpha-based  
machines with Linux and Unix operating systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Unix is widely used for high-end corporate computing because  
it's considered more reliable than Windows NT. Linux produces a 
64-bit version of its operating system for Alpha users that is 
available at low cost. 
</P>
<P>
	The Alpha chip was developed in the early 1990s by engineers at  
Maynard-based Digital Equipment Corp., which was acquired by Compaq 
in 1998. The alpha chip, which Compaq helps design, is manufactured 
by Intel and Samsung, among others, Finlaw said.

<HEADLINE>  Swiss Secret Service Head Barred </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERN, Switzerland (AP) -- The head of the Swiss secret service  
has been suspended over reports that he was involved in creating a 
secret army, the Swiss government announced Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense minister Adolf Ogi told reporters Peter Regli had been  
suspended at his own request as a fraud investigation took on 
``unimaginable'' dimensions. Regli denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Former defense ministry accountant Dino Bellasi was arrested  
last week accused of stealing $5.8 million from his employers, the

	BERN, Switzerland (AP) -- The head of the Swiss secret service  
has been suspended over reports that he was involved in creating a 
secret army, the Swiss government announced Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense minister Adolf Ogi told reporters Peter Regli had been  
suspended at his own request as a fraud investigation took on 
``unimaginable'' dimensions. Regli denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Former defense ministry accountant Dino Bellasi was arrested  
last week accused of stealing $5.8 million from his employers, the 
largest embezzlement ever reported by the Swiss government. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was only after a newspaper report on Sunday that deputy  
federal prosecutor Felix Baenziger admitted that ``hundreds'' of 
weapons, as well as ammunition, had been seized from a site near 
the Swiss capital, Bern, in connection with the investigation.

<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's prime minister summoned defense and law  
enforcement chiefs Sunday to review their campaign against Islamic 
militants occupying southern villages -- a campaign that has failed 
to dislodge the rebels despite two weeks of attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting in Moscow came after Russian forces chalked up some  
victories in the republic of Dagestan. They said Sunday they 
captured parts of a rebel stronghold a day after seizing a key 
rebel supply route. 
</P>
<P>
	Control over the Tando mountaintop and the Kharami mountain pass  
leading to neighboring breakaway Chechnya is seen as vital for the 
militants. The strength of the Russian positions was unclear, and 
the tenacious rebels have recaptured ground before. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels crossed from Chechnya to seize several villages in  
Dagestan on Aug. 7. They are seeking an independent Muslim state in 
the Caucasus Mountains region. 
</P>
<P>
	The fighting is the worst in Russia since federal troops  
withdrew in humiliation after a 1994-96 war with separatists in 
Chechnya. The Kremlin is pouring troops and weaponry into Dagestan 
but wants to avoid a repeat of the Chechnya debacle, particularly 
ahead of December parliamentary elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called an unusual meeting Sunday  
of Russia's ``power ministers'': Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev; 
Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo, in charge of the police force; 
the head of the Federal Security Service, the main successor to the 
KGB, Nikolai Petrushev; and the chief of the armed forces general 
staff, Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin. 
</P>
<P>
	They discussed strategy, specific military operations, Russia's  
political situation and aid to refugees, Russian news agencies 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has also appealed to the United States, Israel, Saudi  
Arabia and Turkey for intelligence on the rebels, Rushailo said on 
Russian television Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Putin -- a former national security chief who was named prime  
minister a week after this month's fighting began -- met later 
Sunday with the head of Dagestan, Magomedali Magomedov. 
</P>
<P>
	In Dagestan, federal troops were in partial control of Tando and  
were widening their grip on the area, Lt. Col. Viktor Gubriy of the 
Defense Ministry said from Dagestan's capital, Makhachkala. 
</P>
<P>
	The military command and Dagestan's Interior Ministry said 28  
guerrillas were killed in fighting Saturday over the Kharami pass, 
used to ferry fighters and weapons from Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of Russian casualties in the clashes Saturday and  
Sunday was unclear. The Defense Ministry reported one officer 
killed Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials say up to 700 rebels have been killed in the  
two-week conflict, though the rebels say the figure is hugely 
exaggerated. Moscow has acknowledged losing about 40 soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian commanders have been predicting the militants' imminent  
defeat for days, but the fighting has dragged on. President 
Yeltsin's spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin conceded Saturday, ``It's 
impossible to expect a quick solution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is believed to have dispatched thousands of troops to  
fight the rebel force of about 1,200. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in Dagestan, an impoverished region west of the  
Caspian Sea, say more than 11,000 civilians have fled the remote, 
rugged conflict zone. While support for separatism in Chechnya was 
widespread, most people in Dagestan oppose the militants, and many 
Muslim leaders in Russia have also condemned the rebels' violent 
tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	Dagestani police are cracking down on Islamic extremists,  
detaining 100 people in the past 10 days and seizing religious 
literature in one home, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Take On Deflation Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Big screen color TVs sell for $150. Washing  
machines go for $100. Men's and women's shirts are $2.50. Prices 
have never been lower at Beijing's Landao Department Store. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's the problem.  
</P>
<P>
	China is struggling to transform state-run factories into  
competitive industries but its markets remain glutted with consumer 
goods. Producers already deeply in debt are bankrupting each other 
with fierce price wars instead of adjusting to market demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Fearing that the deflationary debt spiral will worsen  
unemployment and ignite social unrest, the government announced a 
ban last week on investment in production of a wide array of 
consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, President Jiang Zemin is visiting one factory after  
another, exhorting all to do their best to reinvigorate state 
enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good performance of state enterprises is not only a major  
economic issue ... but also a major political issue affecting the 
fate of the socialist system,'' Jiang said in a recent speech 
during a trip to the industrial northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	His campaign to reboot the economy seems, however, to be making  
little headway in weaning state industries from their reliance on 
state subsidies and protection. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have gotten to the point where the easy stuff has been  
done and they are running into economic, political, financial and 
social constraints,'' said Ken Courtis, regional economist for 
Deutsche Bank Capital Markets (Asia). 
</P>
<P>
	Prices in the saturated consumer market have been falling since  
October 1997. Regulators imposed minimum prices for TV sets and 
some other items, but instead of cutting production, state 
factories churned out even more. As prices drop, losses are 
mounting, driving manufacturers ever deeper into debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Many products may be the cheapest ever, after adjusting for  
inflation, but consumers aren't buying. With factories laying off 
workers by the millions each year, people worried about losing 
their jobs are stashing their money away. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the Asian economic crisis and slower world growth  
have cut Chinese exports and reduced foreign investment. Massive 
public works spending, repeated interest rate cuts and other 
tinkering haven't spurred consumer buying. Now the government 
spending boom is waning. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the sense of crisis, President Jiang and other leaders  
seem to lack the political will to starve inefficient state 
enterprises and nurture the fast-growing private sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they are resorting to a mishmash of government mandates  
that may help alleviate the symptoms of China's industrial malaise 
but are unlikely to cure it. 
</P>
<P>
	Production of television tubes was suspended for two to three  
weeks in early summer. Investment in factories to produce TV sets, 
air conditioners, refrigerators, plastic bags, bicycles, microwave 
ovens, candy, salt, apple juice, liquor and other items will halt 
Sept. 1. To counter a real estate glut, officials will withhold 
permits for new luxury apartments, hotels and office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	The government announced recently it will raise pay for civil  
servants by 30 percent to 40 percent, apparently in hopes of 
discouraging corruption and encouraging more consumer spending. To 
compel the thrifty to spend more, it reportedly plans to tax the 
interest on savings. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, while the economy sags, government bureaucrats and  
state-enterprise managers are tied up with a Maoist-style political 
campaign intended to purge those judged to be corrupt or disloyal. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials say they have lost weeks of work time to Jiang's  
``three stresses'' campaign, which is emphasizing theoretical 
study, political consciousness and ``healthy'' trends. 
</P>
<P>
	Another campaign, against the banned Falun Gong meditation sect,  
also has eaten up valuable time. 
</P>
<P>
	Courtis, the Deutsche Bank economist, says that little will  
change as long as leaders fail to enforce a wholesale overhaul of 
industrial management and to create financial markets to channel 
credit to the economy's most dynamic sectors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Money is going only to those who know how to destroy capital.  
They can keep pulling all the levers, but until that basic 
mechanism changes, the economy won't recover,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Boggs Honored for 3,000th Hit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Wade Boggs Day had an emotional  
start. 
</P>
<P>
	The newest member of baseball's 3,000-hit club emerged from the  
Tampa Bay Devil Rays' dugout Sunday and immediately walked over and 
hugged Ted Williams, arguably the greatest hitter ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``I read your book in high school and you gave me the  
inspiration to just try and be a little bit as good as you,'' Boggs 
said during the on-field ceremony. ``That inspiration has carried 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who took off and tipped his hat following Boggs'  
comment, was one of the baseball notables in attendance. Others 
included former manager John McNamara and hitting coach Walt 
Hriniak. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a little different type hitter than some other great  
hitters I've seen, but they in turn haven't been Wade Boggs,'' 
Williams said. ``Three thousand and four (hits) ... wow. Anybody 
that gets 3,000 hits in this game, buddy, can hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs' wife Debbie, daughter Meagan, son Brett and father Win  
also took part in the ceremony. Boggs became emotional when talking 
about the role his father played in his baseball development and 
when thanking the fans. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 40-minute ceremony, Boggs was presented with the home  
plate he kissed after becoming the first player to homer for his 
3,000th hit Aug. 7th. 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs also received the Joseph Cronin Award for significant  
achievement from AL President Dr. Gene Budig and a fishing boat 
from the Devil Rays. 
</P>
<P>
	Activities before the Devil Rays' game against Kansas City  
included video tributes from Tony Gwynn, who also reached the 
3,000-hit mark this season, George Brett and Reggie Jackson.

<HEADLINE> Streetcars Make Comeback in Oregon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- It's been nearly half a century since  
streetcars clanged and rattled through the streets of Portland. In 
most cities, they are little more than nostalgic, oak-and-iron 
memories. 
</P>
<P>
	Now this city that prides itself on its forward-thinking urban  
planning is digging up streets where some of the old rails ran and 
trying to build a new streetcar line. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to keep the urban flight that goes to the suburbs,''  
said Mary Volm, a spokeswoman for Portland's Department of 
Transportation. ``It has killed a lot of cities. We want to have a 
continually growing and healthy downtown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sleek, modern streetcars scheduled to go on line in 2001  
will bear little resemblance to their creaky, open-sided 
forefathers. 
</P>
<P>
	The cars are just a small part of long-range planning for a  
metropolitan area that has nearly 1.5 million people and expects 
another half million to move in over the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Parking fees, parking bonds and tax hikes are funding nearly all  
of the initial $52.8 million building costs, with $8 million 
privately raised through a downtown improvement district that made 
it clear it didn't want just another bus line. 
</P>
<P>
	``They told us rubber tires wouldn't do it,'' said Vicky Diede,  
the city's project manager. ``Bus lines change. Rails have a sense 
of permanence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five modern, 66-foot streetcars with air-conditioning and ramps  
for the disabled are being built for the project in the Czech 
Republic. Nobody makes them in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Track is being laid for the initial 4.3 miles at the edge of the  
downtown area with connections to light rail and bus lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial loop will connect the Pearl District, a 150-acre  
former industrial area programmed for upscale development, to the 
downtown area and Portland State University. Fares will be the same 
as bus and light-rail lines. And within the downtown area, the 
streetcars will be free. 
</P>
<P>
	With an urban growth boundary that limits sprawl and protects  
surrounding farmland, Portland is looking increasingly at 
high-density housing within that boundary to absorb the flood of 
newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials see an electric streetcar system as a catalyst  
for development of parts of the city that are ripe for it. 
</P>
<P>
	D. Carter MacNichol, the overall project manager, said other  
cities, including Aspen, Colo., are interested in seeing if 
Portland can do what it wants to do at a relatively low price. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Portland City Council was unanimous in approving the  
project, some city residents wonder if more research should have 
been done. 
</P>
<P>
	Brad Carman, a salon owner whose business sits along the planned  
streetcar route, contended there has never been a study to 
determine likely ridership. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fine to put the train sets in, but ridership remains to  
be seen,'' he said. And city residents should have been allowed to 
vote on the project, as they did on the light-rail issue, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Project managers say they doubt Portland will ever again have  
the 200 miles of streetcar track it had from the 1890s into the 
1930s, when the city began to pave over the rails as reliance on 
the automobile increased. By the 1950s, they were gone. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I believe Portland will build more of these,'' MacNichol  
said. ``There is talk of other connectors from other neighborhoods 
to the downtown and the northwest district.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When a downtown bridge across the Willamette River was  
refurbished recently, it was engineered to facilitate streetcar 
rails, just in case.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Bears Down on Texas Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- Coastal residents braced Sunday for  
Hurricane Bret whipped the sea with wind of 140 mph and was 
expected to hit somewhere along the Texas coast during the 
afternoon or night. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service posted a hurricane warning for a  
220-mile stretch of the Gulf Coast from La Pesca, Mexico, to Port 
O' Connor, Texas, between Corpus Christi and Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents and tourists had been ordered to get off popular South  
Padre Island by 8 a.m. Sunday, though most had already fled for the 
mainland Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities didn't mince words about the consequences.  
</P>
<P>
	``You're not going to live if you stay on the island and the  
hurricane hits. You're going to drown,'' said Cameron County Judge 
Gilberto Hinojosa. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy traffic flowed Sunday morning along Interstate 37 as  
people headed out of the coastal city of Corpus Christi toward the 
inland city of San Antonio, said Tom Vinger of the Texas Department 
of Public Safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas National Guard called 600 troops to active duty Sunday  
morning to be sent wherever they were needed, said Master Sgt. 
Larry Todd. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters had upgraded Bret to the second-strongest  
designation of Class 4 on Saturday, as coastal residents stocked up 
on gasoline and groceries. Building supply stores were overrun with 
people seeking plywood, nails, flashlights and generators. 
</P>
<P>
	At 8 a.m. Sunday, the year's first Atlantic hurricane was  
located about 80 miles east-northeast of Brownsville or 125 miles 
southeast of Corpus Christi. It was moving toward the northwest at 
10 mph, and was expected to gradually turn toward the 
west-northwest and slow down over the next 24 hours, the National 
Hurricane Center in Miami said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The latest forecast has the center of the storm making  
landfall somewhere near Corpus Christi, (Texas),'' said Colin 
McAdie, a Hurricane Center meteorologist. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to powerful wind, Bret was expected to spin off  
destructive tornadoes, drench the region with up to 10 inches of 
rain and hit the coast with 10-foot waves, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas hasn't been hit by a hurricane since Hurricane Jerry  
killed three people in October 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	While Hurricane Bret still presented a threat of heavy rains on  
Mexico's northernmost Gulf coast, forecasters said the danger to 
Mexico had lessened. 
</P>
<P>
	In Mexico, hurricane warnings were still in effect for a  
160-mile stretch of Mexico's northern Gulf coast from Matamoros 
south to La Pesca. A hurricane watch extended another 100 miles 
south to Tampico. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of Matamoros, a city of 360,000 across the border from  
Brownsville, rushed on Saturday to tape windows and pile sandbags, 
and stores were packed with residents buying food and water. 
</P>
<P>
	Matamoros Mayor Homero Zamora Ayala declared a state of alert  
and said as many as 7,000 people would be evacuated from low-lying 
coastal areas. An improvised shelter was established at an area 
convention center, where an estimated 500 people were expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the storm takes our house, we will lose everything,''  
fisherman Ernesto Martinez Rodriguez said of the wood and tarpaper 
shack he left behind in the fishing village of Mezquital, near 
Matamoros. 
</P>
<P>
	The hurricane could cause storm surges and coastal flooding 10  
to 15 feet above normal tides. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous hurricane warnings for the Mexican Gulf coast further  
south in the coastal state of Tamaulipas were downgraded to 
hurricane watches, but the threat of heavy rains remained along 
much of Mexico's coast. Tamaulipas residents were told to expect as 
much as eight to ten inches of rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Saturday, Bret became one of two hurricanes in the  
Atlantic. As of 6 a.m. Sunday, Hurricane Cindy was moving west at 
about 9 mph and was located about 590 miles west of the Cape Verde 
Islands. It had maximum sustained winds of 75 mph, with higher 
gusts, the hurricane center reported.

<HEADLINE> Burn 4, Fire 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The Dallas Burn scored on all four shots in a  
shootout and edged the Chicago Fire 4-3 on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire forward Josh Wolff's second goal of the game with 39  
seconds to go tied it at 3. Chicago (12-11) was successful on only 
three of five shootout attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas (13-12) went up 2-0 on goals by Ariel Graziani and Chad  
Deering late in the first half. A pass from Graziani sprung Deering 
at midfield and he beat Chicago goalkeeper Zach Thornton on a 
left-footer from the top of the 18-yard box. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago countered quickly with Wolff's first goal and a header  
by Kema Kovalenko past Dallas keeper Matt Jordan. A goal by the 
Burn's Richard Farrer in the 56th minute appeared to put Dallas 
ahead to stay before Wolff's last-minute goal. 
</P>
<P>
	With the victory, Dallas moved into sole possession of third  
place in the Western Conference.

<HEADLINE> Study: 6 Percent Are Web 'Addicts' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Almost 6 percent of Internet users suffer from  
some form of addiction to it, according to the largest study ever 
of such people. 
</P>
<P>
	``Marriages are being disrupted, kids are getting into trouble,  
people are committing illegal acts, people are spending too much 
money. As someone who treats patients, I see it,'' said David 
Greenfield, the therapist and researcher who did the study. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings, which were released Sunday at the annual meeting  
of the American Psychological Association, appear likely to bolster 
the expanding acceptance of compulsive Internet use as a real 
psychological disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimberly Young, a pioneer in the new field of research, said the  
latest study is so broad that it ``adds a layer of legitimacy to 
the concern that Internet addiction is real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, the 6 percent figure is lower that some estimates of 10  
percent or more stemming largely from research on college students. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenfield, who is a psychologist in West Hartford, Conn.,  
carried out the study jointly with ABC News. He collected 17,251 
responses to an Internet use questionnaire distributed and returned 
through the Web site ABCNEWS.com. 
</P>
<P>
	He adapted his questions from a widely used set of criteria for  
gambling addiction. For example, the questionnaires asked if 
participants had used the Internet to escape from their problems, 
tried unsuccessfully to cut back, or found themselves preoccupied 
with the Internet when they were no longer at the computer. 
</P>
<P>
	If participants answered ``yes'' to at least five of 10 such  
criteria, they are viewed as addicted. A total of 990 participants, 
or 5.7 percent, did answer ``yes'' to five or more questions. With 
an estimated 200 million Internet users worldwide, that would mean 
that 11.4 million are addicts. 
</P>
<P>
	The question about using the Internet as an escape yielded more  
``yes'' answers than any other: 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenfield's analysis of the data suggests that Internet users'  
feelings of intimacy, timelessness and lack of inhibition all 
contribute to the addictive force of the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a power here that's different than anything we've  
dealt with before,'' said Greenfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers did caution that, while one of the best estimates  
yet, the 6 percent figure is based on a group of people who use 
only one Web site, however broadly aimed. The questionnaire also 
followed ABC news coverage on Internet addiction, so relatively 
more compulsive users might been drawn to the survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers said Internet addiction will ultimately be broken  
down into several categories, perhaps revolving around sex and 
relations, consumerism, gambling, stock trading, and obsessive 
Internet surfing for its own sake. 
</P>
<P>
	Therapists at the psychology meeting said they have successfully  
treated some Internet addicts, often with a mix of talking sessions 
and programs aimed more narrowly at reducing a sharply defined set 
of behaviors.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Bookmaker Vows Return to Gambling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKLIN, Ohio (AP) -- The man who said he was Pete Rose's  
bookmaker intends to resume the career that led to his serving time 
in prison, but plans to choose clients more carefully. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's going to be illegal gambling from now on until  
eternity,'' Ron Peters told The Cincinnati Enquirer for a story on 
Sunday. ``And I'm going to be part of it. This time, though, it 
will be on a much smaller scale. I don't want that type of 
high-profile client any more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe to this day that if he hadn't been a client of mine,  
I'd still be doing what I was doing,'' Peters said. 
</P>
<P>
	The comments came days before Tuesday's 10-year anniversary of  
Rose's banishment from baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Peters helped authorities build their case against the career  
hit leader, saying Rose betted on baseball, including his own team, 
the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose admitted betting through bookies, but denied placing bets  
on baseball. He later pleaded guilty to two felony counts of 
failing to report income from autograph appearances, baseball 
memorabilia sales and gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Peters served concurrent two-year sentences at a federal prison  
in Terre Haute, Ind., for tax and drug trafficking convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that when released, he drifted through unsatisfying  
jobs, later becoming depressed and dependent on drugs. He began 
writing bad checks to sustain his drug habit and completed a second 
jail sentence this spring for grand theft of a friend's car, he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Rodman Arrested on Drunk Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Dennis Rodman was released from  
jail Sunday, several hours after police were called to a 
restaurant-bar by someone who said the flamboyant former NBA star 
was drunk and causing a disturbance. 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old Rodman, known for dyeing his hair and numerous  
tattoos and body piercings, spent a few hours in custody before 
being released on his own recognizance, Sgt. Jim Kaminsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to Rodman's agent, Steve Chasman, seeking comment were not  
immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman was booked for investigation of being intoxicated in a  
public place, a misdemeanor, Kaminsky said. Rodman was ordered to 
appear in court Oct. 1. Before then, prosecutors will determine 
whether to file any charges, Kaminsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police had few details of the incident, but the restaurant owner  
said it didn't appear to be instigated by Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what I understand, a woman was verbally abusing him, and  
he said something back to her, and her boyfriend grabbed him and 
the police were called,'' said Ralph Furra, whose wife Julie was 
managing the restaurant at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested Rodman outside the restaurant, where he is a  
regular, Furra said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've never had any problems with him; he's well-behaved,''  
Furra said. 
</P>
<P>
	The police were called to the restaurant most likely by a  
customer or a bartender, Furra said. His wife did not place the 
call, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another man arrested with Rodman, Donn Emerson, 36, was booked  
for investigation of obstructing a police officer. The details of 
his involvement and his relationship with Rodman weren't 
immediately known, Kaminsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Emerson also was released on his own recognizance.  
</P>
<P>
	Rodman played for the Detroit Pistons, San Antonio Spurs and  
Chicago Bulls before joining the Los Angeles Lakers for a short 
stint this year. The Lakers waived him in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, who has made headlines off and on the court for years,  
has been sued twice this year. A Kentucky woman has filed suit 
against him in June, claiming he assaulted her in the lobby of a 
Las Vegas resort. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 19, a casino security guard sued Rodman, accusing him of  
grabbing her breast while she was working at the Las Vegas Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
	Three lawsuits filed in Las Vegas in June 1998 involve other  
allegations about Rodman's behavior in casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	A Las Vegas Hilton employee accused him of grabbing her and  
lifting her off the ground in April 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	A Las Vegas woman accused Rodman of sexually assaulting her in  
April 1998 at the Las Vegas Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
	A craps dealer at The Mirage filed a lawsuit alleging Rodman  
humiliated him at work by rubbing his groin and head.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Reaches 50 Homers Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mark McGwire hit two home runs against the New  
York Mets on Sunday to become the first player to reach 50 homers 
in a season four straight years. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's 50th came on a 1-0 count leading off the seventh  
inning against Jeff Tam. The ball just cleared the outstretched 
glove of Shawon Dunston in left-center and landed just past the 
396-foot sign. 
</P>
<P>
	That was a routine fly compared to his first shot.  
</P>
<P>
	Big Mac left his mark on Shea Stadium in the first inning. He  
hit a 1-1 pitch from Octavio Dotel 502 feet -- his longest of the 
season -- and left a dent about 60 feet high on the scoreboard in 
right-center. 
</P>
<P>
	The shot shattered a lightbulb in the 16 for Ray Lankford's  
number -- just a few feet below McGwire's 25. In the bottom of the 
third inning, a worker climbed up the back of the scoreboard to 
screw in a new bulb. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire moved ahead of his pace from his record 70-homer season,  
hitting No. 50 in the Cardinals' 124th game -- one game earlier than 
last year. That is the second fastest pace ever, behind only 
Chicago's Sammy Sosa -- who hit his 51st Saturday in the Cubs' 121st 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire also tied Babe Ruth for the most 50-homer seasons in a  
career with four. Six players, including Sosa, have hit 50 in two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who has 230 homers over the last four years, has seven  
multihomer games this year and 60 in his career.

<HEADLINE> Relief Agency Readies for Hurricane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hurricane Bret has the ``clear potential of  
producing a major disaster,'' possibly more destructive than 
Hurricane Andrew in 1992, the National Weather Service declared 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A vital difference between Bret and Andrew, the service's Jim  
Hoke said, is that the hurricane bearing down on the Texas east 
coast is moving much slower while carrying the same 140 mph winds. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoke appeared with officials of the Federal Emergency Management  
Agency to discuss preparations for the expected afternoon or 
evening landfall. 
</P>
<P>
	FEMA's director of response and recovery operations, Bruce  
Bahghman, said the agency has prepared four emergency medical and 
relief teams for deployment once the location of Bret's landfall is 
certain. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoke said a tornado watch was to be issued Sunday afternoon on  
the south Texas coast to warn against twisters Bret was likely to 
spawn as it closed in between Corpus Christi and Brownsville. The 
area already was under a hurricane warning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hurricane Bret has the clear potential of producing a major  
disaster,'' Hoke said. ``It has the ingredients to threaten life 
and property in many ways. These ways include storm surge, flooding 
from rains, high winds and tornadoes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the biggest worry of emergency workers is that barrier  
islands and low-lying coastal areas will be inundated by a storm 
surge of 10-15 feet.

<HEADLINE> Greene Just Misses World Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- The track was lightning fast, and so were  
Maurice Greene and Marion Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene overcame a stumbling start to win his second straight  
world title at 100 meters Sunday night, missing his world record by 
.01 seconds with a time of 9.80. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones kept the gold medal run going in her family, matching the  
victory of her husband, shot putter C.J. Hunter on Saturday, in 
winning her second consecutive women's 100 in 10.70. Her time 
equaled the sixth fastest in history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe if I didn't stumble, my time would have been  
faster,'' Greene said after halfway completing his goal of sweeping 
the 100 and 200 at the World Championships, a feat not accomplished 
in a major international championship since Carl Lewis at the 1984 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``The beginning was very shaky, but I didn't panic. I ran under  
control. I finished strong,'' he said. ``In the 100, everything you 
do takes off hundredths of a second. I wasn't trying for the world 
record. I don't try anymore. If it comes, it comes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As soon as he crossed the finish line, Greene celebrated by  
twirling his hand to the crowd. After seeing his time on the 
scoreboard, he shook his head and said, ``Damn,'' realizing how 
close he had come to matching the world record of 9.79 he set at 
Athens June 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene kneeled on the track, holding his head in his hands for  
several seconds. Then he looked up at training partner Ato Boldon 
in the stands and shouted, ``That's for you, Ato,'' before setting 
out on a victory lap with the American flag. 
</P>
<P>
	Boldon, who pulled out of the championships with an injury, and  
hurdler Larry Wade embraced Greene on the track. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach John Smith, who has molded Greene into the world's top  
sprinter, was impressed by the way his protege ran down Canada's 
Bruny Surin over the final 20 meters. Surin finished second in 
9.84, equaling the third fastest time ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``He won it coming from behind -- Carl Lewis style,'' Smith said.  
</P>
<P>
	Greene was relieved that he had won one of his toughest races.  
</P>
<P>
	``In the end I was just thinking I'm glad it's all over,'' he  
said. ``I think Bruny and I produced a great spectacle, maybe one 
of the best ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Surin blamed himself for the loss.  
</P>
<P>
	``That was very close,'' he said. ``I knew I could beat him, but  
I made a mistake. I passed him a little and panicked. I got excited 
too soon instead of staying relaxed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boldon, one of Greene's training partners, wasn't surprised at  
the comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's caught me so many times,'' said Boldon, the 1997 200  
world champion. ``When he puts his head down ... that's what 
carries him through the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew he was going to catch Bruny. Bruny has a tendency to  
put his head up. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is having the best season ever by a sprinter. He's run  
9.79, 9.80, 9.85, 9.87 and 9.91 (twice). Without the stumble, he 
would have run 9.78.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. team coach George Williams also praised Greene's effort.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought he ran a great race except for the first step,''  
Williams said. ``He stuttered. That cost him a world record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones didn't come close to a world record -- Florence Griffth  
Joyner's 10.49 -- but she did run the world's fastest time of 1999 
and broke the championship record of 10.76 she set in Saturday's 
quarterfinals. Only Jones and Griffith Joyner ever have run faster 
than 10.72 -- FloJo four times and Jones seven. 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, Jones was not the fastest out of the blocks, but she  
quickly assumed control and ran her usual powerful race, beating 
Inger Miller by just over a meter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coming off the victory by C.J. last night, I'm very excited to  
win,'' the ebullient Jones said. ``The goal for the week was to get 
five gold medals in the family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter, who began the gold rush, roared from the stands after  
his wife's victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones will have to do the rest of the family work. She is  
seeking an unprecedented four golds -- in the 100, 200, long jump 
and a relay. 
</P>
<P>
	``I nailed my start today, ...'' Jones said. ``That was perhaps  
the reason I pulled off the victory. I knew that Inger was running 
extra fast. But I put it all together and executed my race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller was jubilant over her third straight personal best after  
finishing second at 10.79. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting there,'' she said. ``Marion's a great athlete, but  
she's not the only one. She's beatable. Everybody is beatable. 
She's not invincible. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be good for our sport that a lot of us are  
stepping up and it's not just going to be -- so, what about Marion 
Jones?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, Jones will be beatable, but she hasn't lost a sprint  
race in two years. She only appears vulnerable in the long jump, 
where she has lost three times. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sunday's other finals, France's Eunice Barber won the  
heptathlon with a career-best 6,861 points and Germany's Karsten 
Kobs took the hammer throw at 263 feet, 3 inches. Kobs celebrated 
by running across the field and diving into the steeplechase water 
jump. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Michael Johnson, the three-time defending champion in  
the men's 400, eased through his opening-round heat in 45.35. 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's 1,500 semifinals, the two fastest milers in  
history, Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco and Noah Ngeny of Kenya, won 
their heats. 
</P>
<P>
	Paraskevi Tsiamita had the longest women's triple jump of the  
year, 49-5 1/2, leading the way into the final. Inessa Kravets, the 
world record-holder from Ukraine, failed to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Svetlana Masterkova of Russia and former  
champion Maria Mutola of Mozambique were the semifinal winners in 
the women's 800. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic champion Lars Riedel, seeking his fifth consecutive  
world discus title, qualified for the final, but Virgilijus Alekna 
of Lithuania, ranked No. 1 in the world last year, led the 
qualifiers at 216-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamaica's Deon Hemmings, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist, ran the  
fastest time (54.27) in the heats of the women's 400 hurdles. 
Defending champion Nezha Bidouane of Morocco also advanced to the 
semifinals.
