<HEADLINE> Shoot-at-Sight Orders in India's Hyderabad City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Shoot-at-sight orders have been
issued after two days of violence and arson, in which four people
were killed in the old city of Hyderabad, capital of Andhra
Pradesh in southeastern India, official sources said here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Two people were killed in police firing while two others
including a woman were stabbed to death in the city which
witnessed large-scale rampage. As a mob went on the rampage
torching shops and stabbing passers-by, police opened fire,
killing two persons. Around 32 persons were injured in a stabbing
and arson spree in communally sensitive areas of the city, Andhra
Pradesh Chief Minister N. C. Naidu told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Naidu said the violence was the handiwork of anti-social
elements.
</P>
<P>
The violence erupted Friday when groups of youth, enraged over
mysterious pamphlets that denigrated a particular community, went
berserk burning buses, stabbing people and attacking shops and
vehicles, leading to police firing at two places. Apart from local
police, additional central forces were called in to tackle the
situation, the same sources said.

<HEADLINE> FAA: U.S. Air Traffic Errors up 20 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Air traffic controller errors in
the United States have increased 20 percent this year, with the
most troublesome trends involving communications and memory
lapses, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said.
</P>
<P>
Quoting FAA officials, the Washington Post said Saturday that in
airport control towers across the nation, where controllers handle
numerous complicated aircraft movements, these lapses often
involved visual misjudgments.
</P>
<P>
On April 3, an Air Canada Airbus A-319 narrowly escaped a
collision with a U.S. Airways DC-9 at the La Guardia airport in New
York because of visual misjudgment. The two aircraft came as close
as six meters.
</P>
<P>
The FAA documents, according to the Post, showed the error
rates were the highest in the New York region, with tower
operations making 1.69 errors per 100,000 operations at La Guardia
Airport and 1.38 errors at John F. Kennedy Airport. The New York
regional control center, which handles flights entering the New
York airspace, also had the highest error rate, 1.98, compared
with a national average of 0.55.
</P>
<P>
The three Washington airports were in the middle range of error
rate, with 0.58 at the Reagan National Airport, 0.52 at the
Baltimore-Washington Airport and 0.41 at the Dulles Airport. The
Washington regional control center ranked fifth among 21 centers,
with an error rate of 1.29, according to the FAA.
</P>
<P>
The number of errors in the first seven months of fiscal 1998,
starting October 1, rose to 1,282 from 1,068 in 1997, according to
a FAA document.
</P>
<P>
While operational errors increased 21 percent, the portion of
errors involving planes on the ground increased 49 percent.
"Operational deviations," in which a controller violates a rule
but creates no potential safety problem, have increased
dramatically, up about 80 percent over the past year through the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Facing the sharp increase in controller mistakes, the FAA
ordered the retraining of 10,000 of the nation's 18,000
controllers recently.

<HEADLINE> Maputo Development Corridor Construction Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Construction of the 400
million U.S. dollars Maputo Development Corridor toll road was
officially launched in the border town of Ressano Garcia,
Mozambiuqe Saturday, South African Press Association (SAPA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela and his Mozambican
counterpart Joaquim Chissano and thousands of people in the town
participated in the grand ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The corridor has been dubbed the largest infrastructure
project on the African continent.
</P>
<P>
After unveiling a commemorative plaque, both Mandela and
Chissano stressed the importance of the corridor to uplift local
communities.
</P>
<P>
It was the first fruit of a broader alliance between South
Africa and Mozambique, Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
"As we cooperated in our struggle for liberation, as we stood
together against oppression and violence, so we now take hands to
improve the lives of our people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Local communities had to seize the opportunities created by
the corridor, Mandela said, stressing, "we need participation,
not only between our two countries, but also between our
provinces, cities and sectors."
</P>
<P>
Chissano said the project was proof of the capacity of
Mozambique and South Africa and of Africa's potential to attract
investment.
</P>
<P>
"We are saying to the world that Africa is not only a zone of
instability, but rather one of economic progress and
development," Chissano said.
</P>
<P>
Chissano assured Mozambicans the toll road would "draw us out
of poverty, because it will bring about job creation", noting,
"we go to South Africa seeking jobs but now the jobs are coming
to us."
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people gathered to witness the launch of the
construction. A military band singers and dancers entertained the
guests.
</P>
<P>
Communities from Mpumalanga Province, South Africa bordering
with Mozambique were bussed to the event and hundreds of VIP
guests, many wearing traditional outfits and dress arrived by
train.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the toll road between Witbank, South Africa
and Maputo, the capital of Mozambique was expected to be
completed in three years.

LONDON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam
denied Saturday that she was planning to make the Irish Republican
Army (IRA) a legal organization.
</P>
<P>
She said new legislation on prisoner releases simply provided a
means for specifying organizations whose members will not benefit
from early releases.
</P>
<P>
Daily Mail reported Saturday that the Northern Ireland
Secretary will have the power to end the organization's terrorist
status under legislation authorizing the release of paramilitary
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam said: "The reports are absolutely untrue." Those talking
about plans to de-proscribe the IRA were unhelpfully trying to
confuse the public, she added.
</P>
<P>
She insisted the Bill contained rigorous safeguards. Those
prisoners still judged a danger to public safety would not be let
out and those who re-offended would be returned to prison.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Condemns Nuclear Tests by India, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Council demanded that India and Pakistan refrain from
further nuclear tests and in this context called upon all states
not to carry out any nuclear test explosion or any other nuclear
explosion in accordance with provisions of the Comprehensive
Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council urged India and Pakistan to exercise
maximum restraint and to avoid threatening military movements,
cross-border violations, or other provocations in order to
prevent an aggravation of the situation.
</P>
<P>
The Council also urged the two countries to resume the
dialogue between them on all outstanding issues, particularly on
all matters pertaining to peace and security, in order to remove
the tension between them, and encouraged them to find mutually
acceptable solutions that address the root causes of those
tensions, including Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council called upon India and Pakistan to stop
their nuclear weapon development programmes, to refrain from
weaponization or from the development of nuclear weapons, to
cease development of ballistic missiles capable of delivering
nuclear weapons and any further production of fissile material
for nuclear weapons, to confirm their policies not to export
equipment, materials or technology that could contribute to the
weapons of mass destruction or missiles capable of delivering
them and to undertake appropriate commitments in that regard.
</P>
<P>
Expressing its grave concern at the negative effect of the
nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan on peace and
stability in South Asia and beyond, the Council encouraged all
states to prevent the export of equipment, materials or technology
that could in any way assist programmes in India or Pakistan for
nuclear weapons or for ballistic missiles capable of delivering
such weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Council reaffirmed its full commitment to and the crucial
importance of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear Teat Ban Treaty as the
cornerstones of the international regime on the non-proliferation
of nuclear weapons and as essential foundations for the pursuit of
nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The Council expressed its firm conviction that the
international regime on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons
should be maintained and consolidated.
</P>
<P>
It urged India and Pakistan, and all the other states that
have not yet done so, to become Parties to the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to the Comprehensive
nuclear Test Ban treaty without delay and without conditions.
</P>
<P>
The Council called on India and Pakistan to participate, in a
positive spirit and on the basis of the agreed mandate, in
negotiation at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva on a
treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear
weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, with a view to
reaching early agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Council required the U.N. Secretary-General to report to the
Security Council on the steps taken by India and Pakistan to
implement the present resolution.

<P>
MOSCOW, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
deeply concerned over the nuclear tests conducted by India and
Pakistan, on Saturday urged India to sign the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation with Indian President Vadjpayee
Yeltsin said that the Indian-Pakistani nuclear competition has
spread far beyond the region. It undermines the nuclear
non-proliferation regime and sets a dangerous precedent of nuclear
weapons spread.
</P>
<P>
In view of that India assured of stopping nuclear tests and
determining to join the de-facto moratorium on nuclear testing and
taking part in the disarmament talks in Geneva, the Russian
president stressed the need for New Delhi to take further positive
steps in this direction.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed possible forms that Russia
directly promotes a dialogue between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three weeks India and Pakistan carried out
nuclear tests that provoked a great deal of attention over the
world.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's
special envoys Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan and Speaker of
National Assembly Saadoun Hammadi returned to Baghdad Saturday
after visits to north Africa and Southeast Asia respectively.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan told the Iraqi News Agency (INA) that his visits to
Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco are important and fruitful as far as
the lifting of the embargo and relations with these countries are
concerned.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the week-long visits, he delivered messages
from President Saddam to Algerian President Liamine Zeroual,
Tunisian President Zine Al-Abidine Ben Ali and Moroccan King
Hassan II.
</P>
<P>
The vice president said he briefed the Arab leaders on Iraq's
relationship with the Security Council and the Special Commission,
known as UNSCOM overseeing disarmament in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He also discussed with them the issue of lifting the embargo
now that Iraq has abided by its obligations under the
U.N. resolutions, and U.S. and (UNSCOM Chairman) Richard Butler's
designs of hostility against Iraq, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan said the three Arab leaders expressed their
understanding of the suffering of Iraqis as a result of the
embargo, adding that they said they would work to bring an end to
this embargo.
</P>
<P>
Also on Saturday, the speaker returned to Baghdad from a 10-day
Southeast Asia tour which took him to India and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Hammadi told INA that he conveyed letters from President Saddam
to leaders of India and Malaysia on the effects of sanctions on
the Iraqi people and Iraq's relations with UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
The speaker said that Indian and Malaysian officials had
expressed their sympathy to and solidarity with the Iraqi people
in their efforts for lifting the sanctions as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Planes Bomb Eritrean Air Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian air force
announced Saturday that it has inflicted heavy damages on
Eritrean war planes and air force complex in air raids launched
on Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the Ethiopian Air Force was quoted by the
official Ethiopian News Agency as saying that "Ethiopian fighter
jets in attack sorties Friday and Saturday have bombed the
Eritrean Air Force base."
</P>
<P>
"The Ethiopian air force in air raids it launched in
retaliation to attacks by the Eritrean war planes on civilian
targets in Mekelle has inflicted heavy damages on the Eritrean
war planes and air force complex," it noted.
</P>
<P>
The statement denied reports on the downing of Ethiopian
fighter jet Friday and described the reports as "unfounded."
</P>
<P>
However, the statement admitted the downing of a war plane
among fighter jets that were in action in the air raids launched
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
As Ethiopia and Eritrea pressed on with their ground and air
war Saturday, Eritrean gunners claimed they had shot down another
Ethiopian warplane on a bombing sortie over Asmara and captured
its pilot. In turn, Ethiopia captured an Eritrean pilot near its
northern town of Mekele after he ejected from his crippled
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The border dispute between the two Horn of Africa countries
turned violent since May when either side accused the other of
invasion.
</P>
<P>
Their dispute centered on a rocky 400 square km triangle of
border land which both countries claim.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian and Eritrean guerrillas fought side by side in the
long struggle which eventually ousted military dictator Mengistu
Haile Mariam in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea was rewarded for its efforts with independence after a
referendum in 1993, and the two countries enjoyed friendly ties
until the long-running border dispute turned violent on May 6.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have mobilized thousands of veterans of the 30-year
liberation struggle.

CAIRO, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's national carrier EgyptAir has
called off all its flights to both Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa
and Eritrean capital Asmara as fightings erupted between the two
Horn of African nations.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East News Agency reported that Mahmoud el-Rawi,
director general of EgyptAir foreign stations, said Saturday's
scheduled flight to the region was canceled and that passengers
were notified.
</P>
<P>
Other flights have likewise been grounded pending improvement
in the situation, he added.
</P>
<P>
A Civil Aviation Authority official said an international
aviators announcement purporting the closure of air routes between
the warring neighbors is a warning to international flights not
to enter the airspace of Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several world countries have started to devise means
to evacuate their nationals from Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian warplanes bombed a combined military-civilian airport
as well as the outskirts of Asmara Saturday, escalating the battle
since May 6 for a 400 square kilometers rocky triangle of land
along their western border.
</P>
<P>
The two countries, among the world's poorest nations, are at
odds over at least six areas along their common border. Eritrea
gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy in Angola for New Sanctions on UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Blondin Beye, the United Nations
special envoy in Angola, has proposed in the U.N. Security
Council new sanctions against the opposition National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
In his speech at a meeting Friday, Beye also warned against a
likely new war in the country, saying the Angolan government
might resort to armed force toward UNITA's obstructions to the
1994 Lusaka Peace Accord, which may lead to new armed conflicts,
the Angola News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Security Council were reported to have
revealed that the sanctions on UNITA which were under study by
the Council include the suspension of UNITA-controlled diamond
trade to cut short its source of income.
</P>
<P>
The serious crisis now in the Angolan Peace Process resulted
from the fact that UNITA has refused to hand over the four
sensitive regions under its control, including Bailundo and
Andulo, two central cities in which its headquarters are located.
</P>
<P>
Antonio Monteiro, Portuguese ambassador to the U.N. and
rotating chairman of the Security Council, told reporters after
the meeting that the situation in Angola is "very serious" and
that new sanctions must be imposed on the former UNITA movement
to push forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that the United States, Russia and Portugal,
the three observer countries of the Angolan Peace Process, have
proposed a draft resolution on new sanctions against UNITA so as
to force it to implement the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council wished very much to save the peace
process and bring to an end the prolonged civil war so that the
Angolan people could lead a peaceful life, Monteiro said.
</P>
<P>
The Council meeting also denounced UNITA for its violation of
the peace agreement by not disarming all its armed units.
</P>
<P>
If the resolution is passed, it will be the third sanctions on
UNITA since the end of 1992 when the civil war broke out after
the country's first multi-party elections. In 1993, the Council
imposed an arms and ammunition embargo on UNITA whereas in
October, 1997 it resolved once again to restrict UNITA
leadership's foreign visits and close the rebel movement's
offices in foreign countries.

<HEADLINE> Baghdad Mourns Young Victims of Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 6 (Xinhua) -- A mass funeral procession was held
Saturday in Baghdad for 41 Iraqi children who died because of
shortage of medicine and food under the eight-year-old
U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The procession, attended by members of a Jordanian medical
delegation which arrived here Friday on board a plane and families
of dead children as well, started from Al-Rashid street and headed
for the building of the U.N. Development Program.
</P>
<P>
Sultan al-Shawi, chairman of the Iraqi Society for Supporting
Children which organized the procession, said the United States
and Britain should be responsible for the deaths because they
blocked the approval of contracts sealed under the oil-for-food
program.
</P>
<P>
Under the Iraq-U.N. oil-for-food deal, Iraq is allowed to
export limited amount of oil to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies, but funds allocated for the medical sector
are far from being enough.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shawi called on the international community and humanitarian
organizations to condemn these actions and work for the lifting of
the sanctions imposed by the U.N. after Iraqi invasion of Kuwait
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics given by the Iraqi Red
Crescent Society, the mortality rate for Iraqi children under
five is on the increase, with nearly 4,000 deaths being registered
in May.

disaster, plaguing the mankind, especially the youth.
</P>
<P>
He said he will appeal to the international community to help
eliminate competely drug-trafficking through Angolan territories.
</P>
<P>
Due to instability as a result of the war, Angola is incapable
of preventing drugs from entering the country effectively,
Chipilica noted, adding that drug smugglers transport drugs via
the Angolan territories before reaching Europe through regions
like Latin America.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that his government will make more efforts in
fighting drug addiction and smuggling after peace is finally
achieved in Angola.

<HEADLINE> PNA Renews Call for Urgent Arab Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) renewed its call in Gaza Saturday for an urgent
Arab summit to study ways of saving the Middle East peace
process, according to a Jerusalem-based Palestinian press service.
</P>
<P>
The Media and Communication Center (JMCC) quoted PNA Minister
of Public Works Azzam Al-Ahmad as saying that it is very important
for Arab states to agree to a Palestinian call for such a summit.
</P>
<P>
The proposed summit should be held whatever there is progress
in the peace process or not, he said.
</P>
<P>
The renewed call came as the prospect for an immediate Arab
summit seems diminishing as there are differences among Arab
states over how to deal with Israel. Some want to see a hardline
Arab stance while some others embrace more moderate tones.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahmad said that besides the peace process, issues such as
Arab solidarity to confront the modern problems should also be
discussed in the summit.
</P>
<P>
Blaming the Israeli side for blocking the peace process, PNA
Chairman Yasser Arafat has asked for an Arab summit to help break
the deadlock in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He made arduous trips to most of the Arab capitals to garner
their support for this purpose. But the time and the venue for
the summit has not been fixed so far.
</P>
<P>
The United States has reportedly asked for a delay in convening
such a summit to allow it more time to convince Israel to accept
its proposal on a 13.1 percent troop redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indicated earlier
this week that he would accept the U.S proposal, and Israel would
carry out a combined 15 percent pullback before the two sides
entering into the final status talks.
</P>
<P>
But Arafat told a PNA cabinet meeting Friday evening in Gaza
that the PNA would not agree to the Israeli offer. He asked Israel
to accept and implement the U.S. proposal as the second stage
redeployment and carry out the third phase pullback before
permanent talks open.
</P>
<P>
"Troop redeployment is a matter of principle and there is a
U.S. proposal and the Israeli side must implement it," Arafat
reportedly told the cabinet.

<HEADLINE> 10,000 Families to Be Resettled in Rwandan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The municipal authority of Rwandan
capital Kigali has started from this month to execute a
comprehensive project of resettling about 10,000 families who are
supposed to be evicted from the houses they occupy illegally.
</P>
<P>
The project "Tente Temporary Permanent" (TTP) was conceived by
the Kigali city authority (P.V.K.) with an objective of providing
houses for the shelterless while returning the houses to their
legal owners.
</P>
<P>
It is being supported financially and materially by the
government, the U.N. Development Program (UNDP), the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other local and foreign
non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
"The evicted are being allocated with plots, tents, iron
sheets, nails, brick-making machine, stones and architectural
designs prepared by the P.V.K," said Kayumba Eudes, director of
Urban Planning and Development. The beneficiaries are expected to
provide labor in brick-making and construction.
</P>
<P>
Already more than 1,000 families have started to be catered
for by the scheme in such special areas of Gitega and Kimisange
surveyed and developed by the city Authority.
</P>
<P>
Sources from Kigali urban prefecture confirmed that about
3,097 people have filed cases to resume their houses.
</P>
<P>
Housing crisis in Kigali has constantly been escalating since
the end of genocide in 1994 when the city population was said to
have redoubled from 200,000 to 500,000 after massive return of
old and new case refugees.
</P>
<P>
The old case returnees and some genocide survivors were
occupying the houses of the new returnees who fled the country
during the genocide.
</P>
<P>
The P.V.K. initiated an intensive campaign last year to move
out those families occupying other's houses as it was affecting
the success of the national policy for unity and reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
But the campaign ended up unpopular as it was not providing an
alternative exit, which the T.P.P project is now refurnishing.
</P>
<P>
"Technically the project is very difficult to run but
politically it should be done, since there is no way
reconciliation can be advanced while some people are still
occupying others' properties," said Kayumba.

<HEADLINE> Iran Hails Three-Country Oil Cut Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Iran said Saturday that it backed
the decision made by Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico to further
cut their oil output to shore up oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency IRNA quoted an unnamed Oil Ministry
official as saying that Iran supported any collective action by
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) and non-OPEC producers to boost oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Oil ministers of Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and non-OPEC Mexico
Thursday reached an agreement in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, to
further cut their oil production by 450,000 barrels per day (bpd)
from July 1.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Saudi Arabia will cut output by 225,000
bpd, Venezuela by 125,000 bpd and Mexico by 100,000 bpd.
</P>
<P>
The three countries reached a deal in March to reduce their
production in order to trim world oil supply by 1.6 million to 2
million bpd as oil prices slumped to a nine-year low on the world
market due to sagging demand.
</P>
<P>
The move was followed by OPEC's decision to cut 1.25 million
bpd starting from April 1 till the end of this year. The world
market was little moved by the cut.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the world oil benchmark Brent crude traded at
13.08 U.S. dollars per barrel, as against 18 dollars a year
earlier, while Gulf heavy crude remained at 8.88 dollars a barrel,
lagging far behind last year's 13.65 dollars.
</P>
<P>
OPEC's President Obeid Bin Saif al-Nasir has said recently that
further production cuts were needed to raise the stagnant oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
Iran, the third largest oil producer in the world, has seen a
sharp fall in oil earnings in the past Iranian calendar year
ending March 20 with only 15.8 billion dollars fetched, far below
the target of 17.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official said that the issue of oil output cuts
will figure high at the upcoming OPEC ministerial meeting to be
held in Vienna on June 24.
</P>
<P>
The 13-member OPEC, established in 1960, supplies 40 percent of
world's total of 76.5 million bpd.

<HEADLINE> Construction Started on Maputo/Witbank Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Construction on the Maputo/Witbank
road started Saturday with South African President Nelson Mandela
and his Mozambican counterpart Joaquim Chissano unveiling a
commemorative plaque.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony in Ressano Garcia, a small Mozambican town near
the border with South Africa, Chissano said the ceremony is held
two years after the implementation of Maputo Development
Corridor. It indicates not only the confidence both Mozambique
and South Africa have in exploring the region but also the
enhanced bilateral cooperation and friendship, Chissano noted.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the Maputo/Witbank road, he said, is also an
evidence that countries in the region have the good political
will in carrying out large scale projects, which will surely
speed up the economic integration of the southern African region.
</P>
<P>
Chissano also appealed to the business community to invest in
the corridor and the Incomati River valley so as to absorb modern
technology and create job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Mandela also said the impact of the Maputo/Witbank road will
exceed the bilateral scope. It shows that a southern Africa
committed to progress and development, unity and cooperation is
emerging.
</P>
<P>
The 500-kilometer-long Maputo/Witbank road built with 400
million U.S. Dollars, is part of the Maputo Development Corridor,
which is dubbed the largest infrastructure project on the African
continent.
</P>
<P>
Once the road is completed, it will link the industrial
centers in South Africa to Maputo port, shortening the export
route for South African products.
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 government officials, parliament members, and
people of the two countries attended the ceremony.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia stated Saturday that it was
deeply concerned over the outbreak of hostilities between Ethiopia
and Eritrea, and called on the two African states to halt their
bombing raids.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea and Ethiopia unleashed warplanes on bombing raids
against each other Friday, shattering hopes that a peace formula
to quell their border war had been found.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that "These
acts essentially raise the armed stand-off between the two
countries to a new and considerable more dangerous level."
</P>
<P>
The ministry once again "appeals to the opposing sides to show
sense, stop their military actions and sit down immediately at the
negotiating table."
</P>
<P>
According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, the United Nations
has begun evacuating foreigners from Eritrea by plane. Ethiopia,
which at first refused to allow the plane to fly over its
territory to evacuate foreigners from Eritrea, granted permission
to enter its airspace from 6 p.m. (1400 GMT) to 8 p.m. (1600 GMT).

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Tobacco Legislation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Pushing for anti-smoking
legislation, U.S. President Bill Clinton Saturday criticized
members of Congress for standing in the way of saving children's
lives and said, "The American people will not stand for it."
</P>
<P>
"This is a critical moment of truth for Congress," Clinton said
in his weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to lawmakers, Clinton said, "You are not just trying
to kill the tobacco bill. You are standing in the way of saving
one million children's lives."
</P>
<P>
Countering Clinton, Senator Jesse Helms, a Republican, said it
should be up to parents, not the government, to discourage
children from smoking. Sponsors of the legislation "think that
they are going to accomplish something they absolutely are not
going to accomplish," Helms said on CNN's "Evans and Novak."
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive bill sponsored by Senator John McCain, a
Republican, would raise cigarette taxes and more closely regulate
tobacco. The legislation is bogged down in the Senate as
Republicans and Democrats point blame at one another.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the legislation has broad bipartisan support but
is being held up by a few unspecified members of Congress who have
"done everything they could to protect big tobacco by putting off
a vote."
</P>
<P>
"The delay has gone on long enough," Clinton said. "The Senate
should do nothing else until it passes tobacco legislation, and it
should pass it this week."
</P>
<P>
McCain's bill would charge tobacco companies at least 516
billion dollars over 25 years, raise taxes on cigarettes by 1.10
dollar a pack and grant the Food and Drug Administration authority
to regulate nicotine.
</P>
<P>
Relations between congressional leaders soured Friday after
parliamentary maneuvering ended without agreement on how the bill
should proceed.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Tourism Potential Described as Great </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- A foreign tour operator said
Saturday that Zambia's tourism potential is great and the country
could become a major tourist destination in Africa because of the
attractive liberalization policies the government pursuits.
</P>
<P>
Nick Moyo, General Manager of the United Tourism Company, said
here there is need to market the country's vast tourism
attractions abroad so that more tourists travel to it.
</P>
<P>
He said the number of tour operators is still low and there is
need for the private sector to invest in the sector to create job
opportunities and help the country develop economically.
</P>
<P>
He cited south Luangwa and lower Zambezi national parks as the
tourist attraction centers.
</P>
<P>
Moyo, however, said that high entry fees into the national
parks and visa charges prevailing in Zambia are discouraging a
number of tourists from coming into the country.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's tourism earnings reached 78 million U.S. Dollars in
1997 compared with 70 million Dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's tourism industry is not satisfactory due to limited
infrastructure and unsatisfactory management of parastatal
facilities. However, several positive developments have emerged
including the establishment of eight private airlines and
privatization of many previously government-owned lodges.
</P>
<P>
Last year the government adopted a tourism development
strategy including development of private sector-based tourism.

LAGOS, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Composite Consumer Price
Index went up 1.5 percent in March to 2990.6, compared with
2,946.4 in February, the Nigerian TV Authority (NTA) reported

The Composite Consumer Price Index is a measurement of the
changes in the average retail prices of food items, consumer
goods and services in both urban and rural Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The FOS said increase in the consumer price level is mainly a
result of higher prices in food items, fuel and transport.

DAMASCUS, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Lebanese Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri Saturday briefed Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad on
the outcome of French President Jacques Chirac's trip to Beirut,
the Syrian TV reported.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed the latest developments of the
Mideast peace process and bilateral ties, the TV report said.
</P>
<P>
But the report did not give further details about their talks.
</P>
<P>
Chirac paid a three-day visit to Lebanon from May 29-31, the
third one in two years. During his stay there, he urged Israel to
comply with the U.N. resolution 425, which calls for an
unconditional Israeli troops withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel on April 1 decided to withdraw from south Lebanon
provided Beirut took measures to ensure the security and safety of
Israel's northern border areas.
</P>
<P>
The offer was firmly rejected by Lebanon and its ally Syria
which has a great influence on Lebanon. They insisted on
unconditional Israeli troops pullback in line with the resolution
425.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq Al-Sharaa termed Chirac's
remarks as "serious and bold," adding that "the remarks expressed
the pro-peace stance of France and Europe that will help
effectively save the Middle East peace process."
</P>
<P>
France, which ruled Lebanon between the two World Wars, has
been enjoying a good relationship with Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Check Quality of Cosmetics in Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzania Bureau of
Standards (TBS) will examine cosmetic products in the market to
prevent their harm to consumers, especially women.
</P>
<P>
TBS acting director Beatrice Mutabazi said most cosmetics in
the country's market are unsafe, reports said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign countries are dumping unsafe cosmetic products to
Tanzania and it is necessary to inspect the quality of the
cosmetics which are used by most Tanzanian women," Mutabazi was
quoted as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
The bureau has appealed to the Ministry of Industries and
Trade to promulgate import regulations on the standard and
quality of cosmetics, she said.
</P>
<P>
She revealed that the regulations are being drafted and once
they are officially announced, TBS will direct all cosmetic
importers to strictly adhere to the regulations.
</P>
<P>
The regulations will require all imported goods to comply with
the standards of Tanzania or the manufacturing country. In
addition, the exporting country will have to certify that the
product is safe and used both at home and abroad, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
Mutabazi said that TBS will enter into bilateral agreements
with the quality supervision authorities of the exporting country
to ensure that the cosmetics have been certified before they are
imported to Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The acting director has advised people to buy cosmetics from
pharmacies instead of street kiosks and shops.

TUNIS, June 6 (Xinhua) -- A ranking Palestinian Liberation
Organization (PLO) official here Saturday called for a cessation
of Arab normalization of relations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Faisal El-Husseini, member of the PLO Executive Committee in
charge of Jerusalem affairs, said it is important to adopt a
unified Arab stance at this particular stage when the Middle East
peace process is deeply foundered.
</P>
<P>
He urged Arab states to agree to a summit and work out a
coordinated strategy to confront intransigent Israel.
</P>
<P>
"Any Arab summit that fails to yield clear-cut and decisive
resolutions on the Arab-Israeli conflict will harm the Palestinian
cause and the aspirations of the Palestinian people," El-Husseini
told the Moroccan News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader predicted that the future of the region
might be marked with "violence and wars." Therefore, "the
Palestinians will have to deal with the battlefield they were
forced to live in," he warned.
</P>
<P>
"If the Israeli side does not want peace, this is out of our
control and the option of war is therefore raised," he explained.
</P>

El-Husseini is currently visiting Morocco to attend an
international symposium on Jerusalem in Fas, northeast Rabat, on

Arab countries to explain Pakistan's position on the nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is the first leg of Sherif's

<HEADLINE> American Frogs Doing Fine in Chilly Liaoning Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Table frogs from the United States
have proved capable of resisting the severe cold and are doing
well in northern China's Anshan City.
</P>
<P>
When they were first brought to the city in northeast China's
Liaoning Province last June, experts doubted whether the 10 pairs
of American frogs were strong enough to withstand the cold weather.
</P>
<P>
Not only have the creatures survived, but their 4,000
offsprings also have been doing fine.
</P>
<P>
Their survival is attributable to a special method of warmth in
which their pool is wrapped up in plastic sheeting in winter. The
water is kept at 0.5 meters deep, with the ice measuring some 0.1
meter. Workers daily drill holes into the ice to ensure a supply
of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
The frog population had grown to 10,000 by May. Another 10,000
are expected to propagate by this fall.

<HEADLINE> Slow Peace Process in Somalia Arouses Grave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OUAGADOUGOU, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African
Unity (OAU) has expressed grave concern over the lack of
substantive progress toward sustaining and advancing an
all-inclusive process of peace and national reconciliation in
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The 68th Ordinary Session of OAU Council of Ministers
therefore called on the international community to closely
coordinate their efforts with OAU and the Inter-Governmental
Authority for Development (IGAD) in order to facilitate a
negotiated and sustainable settlement of the conflict in that
country.
</P>
<P>
A resolution adopted by the Council of Ministers meeting which
is ending here Sunday night asked all OAU member states and the
international community at large to provide political,
diplomatic, financial and material support.
</P>
<P>
The support should be aimed "to bolster the overall process of
peace-building and national reconciliation, through assistance
provided for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Somalia,
especially in those areas of the country where commitment to
peace and national reconciliation has been demonstrated," the
resolution said.
</P>
<P>
In that regard, "the ultimate responsibility for resolving the
conflict in Somalia rests with the Somali people themselves," it
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The four-day meeting, however, did not forget the appeal to
the United Nations to take speedy action to set up the trust fund
in support of the peace process in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The ministers expressed dismay at the spiraling violence and
increased insecurity arising from the intensification of intra-
and inter-clan disputes.
</P>
<P>
They thus called upon the Somali faction leaders to make
determined effort to bring to an end these disputes which have
led to death and destruction of property.
</P>
<P>
They also called on the international community to provide
urgent emergency humanitarian relief to those affected by the
flooding in Somalia and assist displaced persons for
resettlement.

<HEADLINE> OAU Deeply Concerned Over Crisis in Comoros </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OUAGADOUGOU, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African
Unity (OAU) has expressed deep concern over the unrelenting
crisis and the negative attitude of the Anjouan separatists
toward peace in the Comoros.
</P>
<P>
"The Anjouan separatists have deliberately blocked all
attempts at finding a peaceful and negotiated solution based on
the legitimate aspiration of the population and the cardinal
principle of the unity and territorial integrity of the Comoros,"
said a resolution adopted by an OAU council of ministers meeting
to end here Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
The four-day 68th ordinary session of OAU council of ministers
strongly condemned the unworthy treatment meted out by the
Anjouan separatists to the members of the OAU ministerial
delegation during the visit to the Anjouan island last March.
</P>
<P>
The ministers met with threats and open acts of hostility from
the separatists on their peace mission.
</P>
<P>
The action of the separatists represented a serious threat to
peace, security and stability in the Comoros and the countries in
the Indian Ocean region in general, the resolution says.
</P>
<P>
This also "constituted a very dangerous precedent which could
serve as an example elsewhere in Africa and flouts one of the
most fundamental principles of the OAU, the respect of which is
major for the maintenance of peace, security and stability in
Africa," the resolution points out.
</P>
<P>
The meeting endorsed the recommendations made by the
ministerial delegation at the end of its visit to the Comorian
Archipelago, requesting the countries in the region to take every
necessary step to ensure the respect of principle of unity and
territorial integrity of the Comoros.
</P>
<P>
OAU member states were urgently called upon to aid the
countries in the region and the Comorian government in ending the
current situation and open the new way for a lasting solution to
the crisis.

<HEADLINE> OAU Urges Angola's UNITA to Fully Demilitarize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OUAGADOUGOU, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African
Unity (OAU) has urged the National Union for Total Independence
of Angola (UNITA) to ensure full, unconditional demilitarization
of its remaining forces, especially its residual and absentee
troops.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the last phase of the 1994 Lusaka
Protocol, aimed at bringing lasting peace to the country, had
been delayed, a situation that has caused grave concern at the
68th Ordinary Session of OAU Council of Ministers.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the meeting, OAU Secretary-General Salim
Ahmed Salim noted that a total of 7,877 soldiers had so far been
registered after handing over 7,275 pieces of weapons.
</P>
<P>
However, UNITA had failed to comply with the agreed timetable
and the remaining provisions of the Lusaka Protocol as well as
the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions, he
added.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted by the session, the Council of
Ministers appealed to all the OAU member states and the
international community to scrupulously adhere to and implement
the U.N. Security Council sanctions imposed on UNITA.
</P>
<P>
"This is the only way to guarantee the irreversibility of the
peace process in Angola," the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
It also appealed to the international community to render
necessary humanitarian and economic assistance for the
reconstruction of Angola.
</P>
<P>
This is especially important for the rehabilitation of key
infrastructure destroyed during the war and the restoration of
the economic fabric of the country as well as de-mining
activities, the resolution said.

<HEADLINE> River Clean-up Leads to Wild Geese or ducks' Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Residents of Fushun, a renowned
coal capital in northeast China's Liaoning Province, have sighted
more than 1,000 wild geese or ducks swimming on the Hunhe River,
which had suffered serious pollution problems.
</P>
<P>
"Blocks of black oil have been floating on the water for
decades," recalled one old man who lives near the river. In 1971
the river unexpectedly caught fire and spread far and wide for
more than 100 square meters.
</P>
<P>
Residents along the river said they had never imagined that the
river could have become as clear as it is today.
</P>
<P>
The city of Fushun has encountered serious environmental
problems since the early 1970s. Local residents even joked that birds
flying through the region would be dyed black.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the serious pollution to the booming
petrochemical enterprises of the 1970s, which had poor equipment
for pollution control and ignored environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-1980s, however, the city has made a great effort
to help local companies replace equipment for efficient waste
control. A loan of one billion yuan (120 million US dollars) from
the World Bank has been used to set up a sewage treatment plant,
which is expected to handle some 500,000 tons of sewage
each day when finished by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
Some rare wildlife such as wild boar, roe deer and black bear,
which had disappeared in the region for many years, began to
return to the industrial city.

<HEADLINE> Britain Refuses to Return Sphinx's Beard: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Britain has refused to return the
missing part of Sphinx's beard to Egypt, the Egyptian Gazette
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The two countries' negotiations on the issue have recently
broken down, the newspaper report said.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian side could not accept British side's terms for
returning the beard, said the report, without giving further
details.
</P>
<P>
In other similar negotiations with Egypt, the British side
requests as a must the high-tech protection of the antiquities
after they are returned, a precondition Egypt says too harsh to be
accepted.
</P>
<P>
However, a spokesman for the British Culture Ministry was
quoted in the report as saying that Britain has no plan to hand
back the missing part of Sphinx's beard at all.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the British Museum, which houses the beard
along with a selection of rare ancient Egyptian antiquities, is
applying a law enacted in 1863 that prohibits handing back any
rare piece of antiquity.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman's remarks dashed the hope that the beard would be
returned to Egypt to help support the neck of the 4,600-year-old
lion-man.
</P>
<P>
A 10-year restoration project on the giant was just completed
last month.
</P>
<P>
The missing part of the beard, which was obtained by the
British Museum a century ago after it was discovered accidentally
in sand by Italian Giovanni Caviglia in 1816.
</P>
<P>
The beard, also known as false beard, is part of the giant's
royal headdress. The headdress bears a cobra and a false beard,
the symbol of virility of the pharaohs.
</P>
<P>
The lion-man is 20 meters tall and 57 meters long, representing
King Khafre by giving him a lion's body and a pharaoh's head. For
centuries, it faces eastwards and guards the Giza necropolis.

<HEADLINE> Deteriorating Marine Economy Draws Attention of Senior Legislator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- While land resources are
depleting, marine development is becoming the lifeblood of the
nation and must be well-protected, according to a senior
legislator.
</P>
<P>
Qu Geping, chairman of the Environment and Resources Committee
under the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC), said in a
recent interview that along with faster development in the coastal
areas, human activities have greatly undermined the natural marine
ecology.
</P>
<P>
Qu's remarks were specifically in regard to the serious damage
to the coral reefs and mangrove woods in China's tropical province
of Hainan.
</P>
<P>
"Human activities have ultimately resulted in damage to the
marine ecological system, decreasing species of marine life and
heavier natural disasters," said Qu, who, also former director of
the State General Administration of Environmental Protection, has
been engaged in his environmental protection career for more than
three decades.
</P>
<P>
In Hainan Province, local residents spurred by immediate
economic returns have been exploiting coral reefs to make
handcrafts or lime, according to Yang Kunhan, deputy director of
the Hainan Provincial Department of Oceanography.
</P>
<P>
Serious damage to the coral reefs has led to corroded coasts,
fallen coconut trees, silted ports and shipping channels, and
reduced marine life, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the quantity of mangrove woods has declined during
the past several years, to the detriment of the balance of the
coastal ecological system, he said.
</P>
<P>
Aware that the problems are threatening local farming,
fisheries and tourism, Hainan provincial officials are working
hard to rescue the precious marine ecology and protect local
marine life through working relevant regulations and establishing
nature reserves, Yang said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 7 (Xinhua)-- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Optimism about the prospect of an agreement on the second
further redeployment persisted Saturday, despite the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA)'s demand that the pullback should not
include the third stage withdrawal required by the Olso Accords.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The Palestinians emerged from talks with the United States
in London last Thursday unwilling to accept a narrow third
redeployment in the West Bank by the Israeli army. An advisor to
PNA President Yasser Arafat insisted that the U.S. has never
raised the idea of combining all three pullbacks into a 15 percent
withdrawal, adding it is actually a "ridiculous" idea put forward
by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- An advisor to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said an
agreement on the second Israeli troop redeployment will be reached
sometime this week. Eighteen Jewish settlements will be turned
into isolated islands surrounded by Palestinian controlled areas
if the Palestinians receive another 13 percent of the West Bank.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif wrapped up his visit to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and
left here Sunday after briefing the UAE leaders about Pakistan's
position on recent nuclear tests in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
Sharif, who headed for Saudi Arabia, is on a tour to a number
of Gulf states with an aim to seek their support in the face of
U.S. economic sanctions imposed after its nuclear explosions last
week.

<P>
XI'AN, June 7 (Xinhua) -- A new policy encouraging more
overseas investment in the environmental protection industry has
been formulated and promulgated in northwest China's Shaanxi
Province.
</P>
<P>
According to the new policy, Shaanxi plans to introduce large
amounts of advanced environmental protection facilities within the
coming years and welcome foreign businesses to directly invest or
participate in the restructuring of state-owned environmental
protection enterprises.
</P>
<P>
And foreign businesses who take part in the restructuring of
medium- and small-size state-enterprises will receive the same
preferential policies for the province's non-state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises that utilize waste water, waste gas or waste residue
as production materials are entitled to tax reductions within a
five-year period, according to the policy.
</P>
<P>
The environmental protection sector, presently the pillar

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Envoy Hopes for Peace With Eritrea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian government's top
representative in Zimbabwe Sunday said his government was still
giving peace a chance in the troubled border area with
neighboring Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Markos Geta, Charge d'Affaires at the Ethiopian Embassy in
Harare told the Zimbabwe News Agency that Ethiopians regarded
Eritreans as their blood brothers and sisters who for centuries
shared a common history and culture that should not be torn apart
by territorial disputes.
</P>
<P>
"We are still giving a chance for peace and we are expecting
the call from the United States and Rwanda for a peaceful
settlement will be successful," said Geta.
</P>
<P>
The dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea centers around a
rocky 400-square-kilometer triangle in the Badme region claimed
by both Horn of Africa countries.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea began a series of air raids Friday,
turning a month-long border conflict into a battle of the skies.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the Ethiopian Embassy in Harare had made any
approaches to Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe as current
Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to seek his
intervention, Geta said they had not done so because they
expected the situation to return to normal.
</P>
<P>
"We thought that the Eritreans would change their state of
mind before we brought the issue to the OAU. We were hoping that
things would improve, that is why we did not consult President
Mugabe," he said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Lacks Money in Fighting Against AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Lack of funds has hampered the
efforts in Russia to prevent the spread of the HIV virus that
causes AIDS, the most threatening disease in the history of
mankind which is still incurable.
</P>
<P>
"To combat AIDS, money is needed, but there is none," Vadim
Pokrovsky, general director of the Russian Center for Preventing
and Combating AIDS, told the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
In May, the center had received only 6,000 rubles (about 1,000
U.S. dollars), just enough for procedures to determine the stage
of infection of five patients, the general director said.
</P>
<P>
In the past 11 years, 8,428 HIV carriers were registered in
Russia, 294 of them have died of the disease, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, the number of HIV carriers has grown considerably
as more drug addicts are infected through syringe-sharing. Last
year alone, about 4,500 HIV carriers were identified, nearly as
many as the figure registered totally in the previous decade.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Moscow and the Moscow region would become areas with
a high rate of HIV infection by the end of this year, the report
quoted Pokrovsky as warning.

<TEXT>
<P>
OUAGADOUGOU, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African
Unity (OAU) has called for immediate and generous humanitarian
assistance to the people of Sierra Leone, beset with continuous
civil war, especially after last year's military coup.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted by an OAU Council of Ministers meeting
to end here Sunday night, the continental organization appealed
to the international community, OAU members in particular, to
give the Sierra Leonean government all possible assistance in its
efforts to rehabilitate and reconstruct the west African country.
</P>
<P>
The elected government in that country was restored in March
after the west African peace keeping force known as ECOMOG drove
out the military junta which seized power in a coup in May last
year.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the return of the government of President Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah, the 68th Ordinary Session of OAU Council of
Ministers also urged the United Nations and the international
community to help meet the logistical and technical requirements
of ECOMOG, which has been mandated by President Kabbah to take
care of security affairs of the country.
</P>
<P>
Enough support should be given by the international community
in the disarmament and demobilization of armed personnel in that
country so as to ensure general security.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Ministers also called upon the remaining forces
of the ousted junta and allied rebels to cease the atrocities
they have been committing in the northern and eastern parts of
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed that a process of national reconciliation
between Kabbah's government and various groups concerned should
be encouraged.

<HEADLINE> First Chinese University Passes ISO9001 Quality Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Three authoritative Norwegian
maritime experts have approved the quality authentication of
China's leading shipping university.
</P>
<P>
Dalian Maritime University, located in northeast China's
Liaoning Province, is the first university in the country to pass
the ISO9001 authentication.
</P>
<P>
"The introduction of ISO9001 into Chinese universities is
conducive to modern higher education in the country," said
Prof. Si Yuzhuo, president of Dalian university, here Saturday
evening.
</P>
<P>
The International Convention on Standards of Training,
Certification and Watch-keeping for Seafarers (STCWS), which China
joined in 1984, regulates the higher-education and training
institutions on maritime affairs to establish an educational
quality-guarantee system.
</P>
<P>
Green seamen and cadets in shipping schools are required to
receive special training in compliance with the STCWS since August
1 this year.
</P>
<P>
The three Norwegian experts from the DNV, a prestigious
shipping society in Norway, unanimously agreed on the ISO9001
authentication for the university's shipping college, turbine
engineering college, adult education colleges, shipping training
and research center, and foreign languages department.
</P>
<P>
The university, under the Chinese Ministry of Communications,
covers all fields of maritime affairs. It has a current enrollment
of 6,500 students, including those for their doctoral and master's
degrees.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Commander of Iranian Naval Forces
Abbas Mohtaj said on Sunday that the forthcoming joint Iran-India
naval game has nothing to do with Iran's stand towards nuclear
tests carried out by India and Pakistan last month.
</P>
<P>
Mohtaj confirmed that two Indian vessels have arrived at
Iranian territorial waters in the Persian Gulf to join a week-long
drill with Iranian navy due to start on June 9, the Iranian
official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
He added that the exercises are very elementary and of no
operational significance because of the low number of vessels due
to participate.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian commander said Iran has already voiced concern and
transparent view about the nuclear tests of both India and
Pakistan, adding that Tehran supports the comprehensive test ban
treaty and believes that any action by any country to carry out
nuclear test is provocative.
</P>
<P>
Iran has good relations with both Islamabad and New Delhi on
diplomatic and defensive grounds, he added.
</P>
<P>
India donated five nuclear devices on May 11 and 13,
threatening to spark a round of nuclear arms race in the
subcontinent. Pakistan, under great domestic pressure, conducted
two rounds of nuclear tests in response two weeks later.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines Fires Striking Pilots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Airlines (PAL) announced
Sunday that those striking pilots who defied a return to work
order on or before noon Sunday have already lost their employment
status.
</P>
<P>
"Some pilots were able to beat the deadline but those remained
defiant were, in accordance with law and jurisprudence, declared
as having lost their jobs with the airlines," PAL said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The airlines Saturday fired all 29 officers of the Airline
Pilots Association of the Philippines (ALPAP) which staged an
indefinite strike Friday evening, almost paralyzing the firm's
flight operations.
</P>
<P>
It also warned the other striking members of the 620-member
union to report for work until Sunday noon or else lose job.
</P>
<P>
PAL said it was forced to take the drastic step to protect the
interest of its over 13,000-strong work force as well as that of
the riding public.
</P>
<P>
The airlines also accused the striking pilots of holding the
riding public's livelihood and well-being hostage through their
disruption of operations.
</P>
<P>
In pursuit of returning to normal operations, PAL said it has
started processing applications for pilot positions.
</P>
<P>
But union spokesman Florendo Umali said all union members had
agreed to support the 29 union leaders.
</P>
<P>
Some 250 pilots marched in front of the PAL flight operations
center to show their defiance of the return to work order,
according to Umali.
</P>
<P>
PAL said earlier that its decision to terminate the employment
of all striking pilots was based on an article under the Labor
Code and on applicable Supreme Court decisions.
</P>
<P>
Under the Labor Code, a strike that is undertaken despite the
issuance by the secretary of labor of an assumption is illegal,
and the union officers and members are deemed to have lost their
employment status for such an act.
</P>
<P>
By launching the strike Friday, the ALPAP openly defied two
orders of the secretary of labor who already assumed jurisdiction
over the dispute and had prohibited the union from aggravating the
situation, PAL said.
</P>
<P>
The strike was triggered by the sacking of a 45-year-old pilot
who was ordered to retire last year by PAL management in
accordance with an earlier collective bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement reached between PAL and the union, PAL
management has the right to retire pilots who have already
surpassed their normal retirement dates regardless of their age.
</P>
<P>
The ALPAP said the pilot was too young to retire, and also
accused the airline of cutting pilot rest hours and harassing
union members.
</P>
<P>
PAL senior vice president for sales and services Avelino
Zapanta said the company stood to lose millions of dollars if the
strike continued, adding the company would only "manage certain
critical flights" with 25 pilots recalled from administrative
duties.
</P>
<P>
PAL was only able to operate five of the 38 scheduled
international flights and 14 of its 132 domestic flights out of
Manila Sunday. Thousands of passengers are stranded in airports in
Manila and other cities in the country.

HARARE, June 7 (Xinhua) -- A Zimbabwean official has said
speedy and resolute actions are urgently needed because it is not
enough for the government to merely acknowledge the need for
better control of its overspending.
</P>
<P>
President of Confederation of Zimbabwean Industries Kumbirayi
Katsande said targets aimed at curtailing government expenditure
had been set but sadly, not enough had been done beyond the
regular pronouncements.
</P>
<P>
"In the process, we have missed a lot of opportunities to
better the lot of our fellow citizens," Katsande said in the
latest issue of Industrial Review released in Harare Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"As in business, we want results, this is the bottom line," he
said, adding that it had to be accepted that inflation, currently
pegged at 24.6 percent and set to rise to above 30 percent at the
end of the year, is the country's number one enemy.
</P>
<P>
"The government itself has said over many years that it must
act to reduce the huge budget deficit which is the major cause of
our economic woes," he said.
</P>
<P>
The continuing race between prices and wages was unsustainable
because it led to job losses and further hardships for the
people, he said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Condemns India for Fomenting Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Information Minister
Mushahid Hussain Sunday strongly condemned India for fomenting
state terrorism via its intelligence outfit while expressing
regret for the loss of life in the train bomb blast early in the
morning.
</P>
<P>
Mushahid said in a statement Sunday evening that the government
had evidence of the involvement of India's Research and Analysis
Wing (RAW) in the current series of terroristic acts, which first
targeted a cinema in Lahore and now a train through a time-bomb.
</P>
<P>
The main suspect in Friday's cinema blast killing three and
injuring one in Lahore, capital of eastern Punjab province, has
been proved to be an Indian national.
</P>
<P>
The information minister's statement came after a bomb blast
took place in a passenger train early Sunday morning in southern
Pakistan. Twenty-three people were killed and over 30 injured in
the blast.
</P>
<P>
He said that another RAW agent, captured recently in Sialkot
district close to the Indian border, has confessed to involvement
in earlier similar acts of terrorism that resulted in 10 bomb
blasts in 9 weeks, killing 16 and injuring 93 during the first
quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of these acts of terrorism being fomented by India
is two fold: to put pressure on Pakistan since the Indian BJP
government's militarism is fueled by fundamentalism; and to divert
attention away from domestic political and economic frustrations
since the Indian nuclear tests have backfired and divided India,"
He said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan strongly condemns these Indian actions and urges the
international community to take note of the designs of a regime
which is apparently rattled by the restoration of strategic
balance in South Asia, is now resorting to terrorist actions, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Pakistani Foreign Office in a statement also
accused the Indian intelligence agency of masterminding the train
bomb blast, saying the blast "is obviously an abominable
RAW-sponsored terrorist act."
</P>
<P>
"Continuation of such acts of terrorism and making of innocent
civilians their victims would vitiate the atmosphere for a
constructive engagement for finding solutions to the problems in
the region," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The international community has stressed the necessity for a
dialogue to remove the root cause of the tensions in a nuclearized
South Asia," the statement said. "It is also clearly its
responsibility to denounce such acts of terrorism."
</P>
<P>
The bomb, reportedly planted in the middle of a carriage, went
off at about 4:10 a.m. (local time) Sunday when the train heading
for the northwestern city of Peshawar was running about 50 km away
from Sukkur, a major city in Pakistan's southern Sindh province.

<HEADLINE> Second Atmospheric Research Begins on Qinghai-Tibet Plateau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- China formally started its second
scientific research on atmospheric circulation on Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau in tandem with the establishment of a headquarters in the
Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
China's Meteorological Bureau and the Chinese Academy of
Sciences (CAS) led nearly 10 nationwide research and
higher-education institutions to carry out the scientific
endeavor, which includes theoretical research and on-the-spot
experiments in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Scientific workers in the region have regulated the
high-altitude surveying and ground monitoring since May 10.
</P>
<P>
The research will focus on atmospheric physics on the plateau,
the world's highest, to improve the accuracy of forecasting
natural disasters, experts said. In addition, the scientific group
will study monsoon circulation on the plateau, which greatly
affects the overall climate of the world.
</P>
<P>
The former State Science and Technology Commission approved the
research in 1995 and listed it as a key national research
project. China had organized the first research of this kind in
1979.
</P>
<P>
Local scientific workers undertook the surveying and monitoring
in experiment sites at Gerze, Lhasa, Nagqu, Nyingchi, Qamdo,
Shiquanhe and Tingri and dealt with all computerized data during
the experiments.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, scientists will perform research on the ozone layer
and radiation from the sun.

years.
</P>
<P>
This is the third round since May 24, when the elections,
expected to be held on four consecutive Sundays, were
inaugurated. The police stepped up security around polling
stations and at main road intersections.
</P>
<P>
The polls opened at 07:00 local time (0400 GMT) and will close
at 17:00 local time (1400 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Voters queued up to cast their ballots in the capital as
Lebanese leaders called for more support to Christian candidates
in the elections in order the keep the delicate sectarian balance
between the Muslims and the Christians in the country.
</P>
<P>
Muslim political and spiritual leaders have urged Muslim voters
in Beirut not to ignore Christian candidates running for the 24
seats in the municipal council. There are about 177,000 eligible
Christian voters and 200,000 eligible Muslim voters in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday's elections in Tripoli, the country's second
largest city, were seen as disruptive to the Muslim-Christian
balance, which turned out in favor of the Muslims.
</P>
<P>
This time the Sunni Muslim Prime Minister Rafik Hariri asked
the Muslims to vote for Christian candidates to avert a repeat of
the Tripoli debacle and keep a peaceful coexistence between the
two sects.
</P>
<P>
The country protracted and bloody civil war from 1975 to 1990
was caused basically by the political imbalance between Muslims
and Christians.
</P>
<P>
The race for the municipal posts in south Lebanon will go on
mainly between two Shiite Muslim factions - the resistance group
of Hezbollah, or Party of God, and the Amal Movement led by House
Speaker Nabih Berri.
</P>
<P>
The two groups have long been vying for control of the Shiite
Muslims, the country's largest religious sect.
</P>
<P>
During the first round of elections, Hezbollah defeated Amal
in Beirut's southern suburbs.
</P>
<P>
Voting will be held next Sunday in the eastern Bekaa Valley,
thus bringing the country's local elections to an end.

<HEADLINE> Early-Warning Weather Forecast System for Three Gorges Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Chongqing
Municipality will spend 70 million yuan (8.4 million U.S. dollars)
in the next two years to set up an early warning system for
torrential rains for the safety of the Three Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
After construction is completed for another 30 automatic
meteorological stations, the accuracy of the forecast for
torrential rains and other kinds of natural adversities is
expected to rise by 5-to-10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Du Shunyi, director of the Chongqing Municipal Meteorological
Bureau, the early warning system will include comprehensive
meteorological detecting devices, information networks,
information analysis and forecast, and meteorological services.
</P>
<P>
Sophisticated radar is capable of monitoring all the project
areas and an early warning system can provide timely and accurate
weather forecast services for the project, Du said.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing gigantic Three Gorges Project is the world's
largest water control project, which, with a total investment of
around 200 billion yuan (24.1 billion U.S. dollars) is expected to
be completed by the year 2009.
</P>
<P>
As part of the project area, Chongqing is located in an area
frequently hit by torrential rains.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Du said, the system will also use satellite remote
sensing technology and a ground monitoring system to provide data
on environmental and ecological pollution.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Longest Bridge to Be Completed Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge, the
longest bridge in Bangladesh, will be completed on schedule before
its inauguration on June 23, Communication Minister Anwar Hossain
Manju said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Everything was going on smoothly to ensure the completion of
the 4.8-kilometer bridge as scheduled in Tangail district, some 70
kilometers northwest of Dhaka, and preparations were being made
for the inauguration ceremony, the communication minister told
reporters of the Overseas Correspondents Association of
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The bridge, also named "Bangabhandu Bridge" after Bangabhandu
Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the first prime minister of independent
Bangladesh, would be inaugurated by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
on June 23, the date on which the ruling Awami League assumed
power in 1996.
</P>
<P>
At a cost of 900 million U.S. dollars, the construction of the
bridge started in October 1994. Upon its completion, it would
become the longest bridge in South Asia, and the 11th longest in
the world, Abdullah, deputy principal manager of the Jamuna
Multipurpose Bridge Project, told reporters on a separate
occasion.
</P>
<P>
Besides road transportation, the bridge with rails could also
be used for train service, for power and gas transport, and for
telecommunications, he said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and Japan each
provided 200 million U.S. dollars for the construction of the
bridge, with the rest of the fund from the Bangladeshi government.
</P>
<P>
Deltaic Bangladesh in South Asia is crisscrossed by many
rivers, with the Jamuna River, which flows through the country,
dividing it into two distinct and separate regions.
</P>
<P>
At present, passengers and freight traffic between the
northwestern and eastern regions of the country are transported
across the Jamuna River by ferry, which has been an impediment to
the development of an integrated transportation and energy network
in the country, and to its overall economic development.

BAGHDAD, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has announced that it will no
longer accept humanitarian donations from other countries and
world organizations, the Iraqi News Agency reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"From now on, the cabinet decided, the Iraqi government will
not accept any assistance in kind subsumed under humanitarian
aid," the Iraqi cabinet said in an announcement made after a
meeting chaired by President Saddam Hussein Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Iraq needs no money given away by foreign countries and people,
and the Iraqi people are not so lazy as to ask for help from
others, the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
It added that Iraq used to be an aid donor to many states,
institutions and figures.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet, meanwhile, expressed appreciation of all parties
and people who have donated humanitarian aid to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It voiced hope that all parties that have sympathy for Iraq
would continue with their support for Iraq's call to have the
international sanctions on the country lifted.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council imposed the crippling
sanctions on Iraq in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait. Iraq has

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Nepal Striving to Conserve Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government has been
taking various measures in recent years to try to stop the
environment from degrading further for the benefit of integrated
national development.
</P>
<P>
In order to minimize the environmental problems through
institutional efforts, the government established the Ministry of
Population and Environment in September 1995.
</P>
<P>
There are many areas requiring the continuation of
environment-friendly activities, but due to socio-economic
conditions of the country, the ministry is committed to
implementing the primary functions such as environment
conservation, pollution control, enforcement and monitoring of
environmental standards, and environmental assessment with its own
initiative, the ministry said Sunday in a press release.
</P>
<P>
In the past two and a half years, the ministry has launched
public awareness programs through publishing journals, newsletters
and posters.
</P>
<P>
It has supported the concerned agencies to institutionalize
vehicle emission test in the capital city of Kathmandu, use
alternative fuel, and has made policy decisions to reduce air
pollution at source by discouraging the use of old vehicles.
</P>
<P>
It has also developed a working modality to work closely with
the non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
In addition to continuing research studies to generate
information, the ministry will accomplish the preparation of
background working papers on water resources, agriculture,
forestry, urban pollution and human health, impact of fiscal
policies on the environment, and environmental institutions,
legislation and conventions for the formulation of an
environmental perspective plan, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The drafting of the implementation strategy for
environment-related conventions will be completed by the end of
this fiscal year which ends in July, it added.
</P>
<P>
Nepal participated in the first U.N. Conference on Human
Environment held on June 5-16, 1972 in Stockholm, Sweden. And
during the U.N. Conference on Environment and Development held in
June 1992 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, it signed the Convention on
Biological Diversity and the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate
Change.
</P>
<P>
At present, Nepal is a party to 16 environment-related
conventions, and has developed action plan to implement some of
them.
</P>
<P>
On the home front, the Environment Protection Act 1996 and the
Environment Protection Rules 1997 have been enforced since June
1997. The legislation contains several provisions to
institutionalize environmental assessment system, pollution
prevention and control and heritage conservation.
</P>
<P>
It also contains provisions to punish those who degrade the
environment and empowers the government to provide additional
concession and facility to encourage the adoption of the process
and the technology which brings positive impact on the
environment.
</P>
<P>
Under the act, the Environment Protection Council under the
chairmanship of the prime minister has been established to provide
policy guidance and suggestions to the government, and to ensure
coordination among different agencies.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, an Environmental Conservation Fund has also been
established, the ministry noted.
</P>
<P>
To raise public awareness, the World Environment Day is
celebrated in Nepal each year on June 5 with specific programs.
From 1988 onward, the day has been celebrated as a national
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion this year, an Environmental Awareness Fair was
organized by government ministries and non-governmental
organizations on June 5-7 in Kathmandu to draw the attention of
the society toward the existing environmental problems and to
create awareness regarding possible solutions.
</P>
<P>
On this auspicious occasion, the Ministry of Population and
Environment published the State of the Environment for the first
time as a government document.
</P>
<P>
The report notes that major environmental issues in the
Himalayan kingdom have been emerging from land degradation,
depletion of forest resources, unscientific urban development,
discharge of untreated effluents and disposal of solid wastes.
</P>
<P>
Nepali Minister for Population and Environment Purna Bahadur
Khadka told a press conference held here Sunday that in addition
to the U.N. system and such regional inter-governmental bodies as
South Asian Cooperative Environmental Program and South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), other regional and
international organizations like Asian Development Bank, United
Nations Development Program, World Conservation Union and
International Center for Integrated Mountain Development have also
extended cooperation to Nepal in its efforts to conserve the
environment.
</P>
<P>
However, the State of the Environment warns that based on the
present trend, environmental problems like resource degradation
and pollution are likely to continue in the future, and resource
constraints and the continuation of the existing consumption
pattern will likely accelerate environmental degradation.

<HEADLINE> EU Asks Turkish Cypriots to Join Accession Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) Task Force
chief Nikolaus van der Pas has appealed to the Turkish Cypriots
for their joining the Cypriot government controlled by Greek
Cypriots in the EU accession talks.
</P>
<P>
Van der Pas, director general of the European Commission's Task
Force for accession negotiations, made the call at the end of his
three-day fact-finding mission here, which is part of Cyprus'
accession process.
</P>
<P>
"Regrettably, the Turkish Cypriots decided not to join the
negotiations," van der Pas said, adding "we hope that sooner
rather than later they will change their minds," Cyprus Mail
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia and
Estonia have started accession talks with the EU since March.
</P>
<P>
Van der Pas said Cyprus was very much determined to make
progress in the negotiations, and had the political readiness to
welcome the Turkish Cypriots in the talks.
</P>
<P>
President Glafcos Clerides has proposed that Turkish Cypriots
participate in the government's team to negotiate the island's
membership to the EU, but the idea was rejected by the Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
"The Turkish Cypriot community must understand that the EU
accession process is very much considered to be of benefit to both
communities on the island," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added "when the Turkish Cypriots think of the EU, they
should think of it as a positive project. It is a peaceful
project bringing people together for their own benefit."
</P>
<P>
Denktash walked out of the negotiations with Greek Cypriots
last summer to protest the EU's decision to start accession talks
with Cyprus, not his strong supporter Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally in 1983 a "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus," which is recognized only by
Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Fund for Risk Investment in High-tech to be Established </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, June 7 (Xinhua) -- China will establish a special fund
for risk investment in high technology around the end of the year,
according to financial specialists attending a forum today on the
development strategy of China's capital market in the port city of
Qingdao.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the forum in east China's Shandong Province said
that the People's Bank of China (PBC), the China Securities
Regulatory Commission and the Ministry of Finance are framing a
mechanism for such risk investment, and the mechanism is expected
to boost the country's high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
Since the high-tech industry is considered high risk with high
returns, commercial banks which have a highly floating pattern of
liabilities cannot fund some high-tech projects. Therefore, a
mechanism of risk investment in high technology on the basis of a
sound capital market is essential, according to the specialists.

BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 80 percent of smokers
said that they would not light up in public places where "No
Smoking" signs had been posted, according to the results of a
survey released today.
</P>
<P>
After a survey was conducted among 1,000 smokers in downtown

<P>
However, about 2 percent of smokers said that they would still
smoke despite no-smoking signs. However, no female smokers said
they would defy a smoking ban in public places, the survey shows.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 92 percent of smokers with college degrees such as
teachers and doctors said they would "surely obey a no-smoking
rule."

<HEADLINE> Angolan Govt to Resettle Ex-soldiers With $8M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government will
allocate eight million U.S. Dollars this year to rehabilitate the
demobilized soldiers of the two warring sides, a senior military
official has said.
</P>
<P>
The money will be distributed as financial assistance in line
with the national reconstruction program, General Antonio De
Andrade who is in charge of the rehabilitation of the demobilized
soldiers said in central town Kuito Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 86,686 soldiers of the opposition National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) who have been demobilized
according to the 1994 Lusaka Peace Protocol will benefit from the
sum, the Angolan News Agency reported Sunday, and so will more
than 80,000 former government soldiers who have been demobilized
according to the Bicesse Peace Accord signed in Portugal in 1991.
</P>
<P>
General Andrade said that the Angolan government will greatly
encourage the development of small businesses so as to
accommodate the demobilized soldiers across the nation.
</P>
<P>
The rehabilitation of the demobilized soldiers has been
supported by the United Nations Development Program and the
International Labor Organization.
</P>
<P>
According to the program on the reconstruction of Angola's
infrastructure adopted at the round-table meeting in Brussels in
1995, the U.S., Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands and other
members of the European Union will also provide assistance for
the rehabilitation of the demobilized soldiers.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Angolan government has used various
channels to resettle the demobilized soldiers. Rehabilitation of
ex-soldiers is one of the major issues to be addressed by the
government and a vital matter which hinges on the stability of
the country.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government has established a number of vocational
education centers in several areas to train the demobilized
soldiers so that they will be able to have skills for making a
living.

<HEADLINE> Tehran Mayor Rejects Charges as "Baseless" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein
Karbaschi on Sunday rejected all charges brought against him at
the first session of an open trial of him, calling them "baseless."
</P>
<P>
The charges were read in the court as embezzlement of 14.53
billion rials (about 260,000 U.S. dollars) plus 90,000 dollars, 60
full-priced gold coins and 80 half-priced gold coins, receiving
bribes, mismanagement of public funds, illegitimate ownership of
public properties and fraud.
</P>
<P>
He was also charged with purchasing a building worth 3,800
million rials (about 680,000 million dollars) for an unorthodox
institute and granting 250 million rials (44,643 dollars) to two
former district mayors to fund their election campaigns for the
fifth Majlis (Parliament).
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi defended himself at the open trial which formally
started work Sunday morning at Tehran's special judicial complex
under strict security, with the deployment of hundreds of riot
police equipped with sticks and arms.
</P>
<P>
The trial will last for several days since the case was too
complicated and involved many officials.
</P>
<P>
On April 4, Karbaschi was detained by the conservative
judiciary on multi-charges, but was released 11 days later
following direct intervention from top leaders including President
Mohammad Khatami, former President Hashemi and the supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi was the highest ranking official charged with
embezzlement since the Islamic revolution in 1979. The case
intensified political struggle between the conservatives and
moderates, tipping political factions against each other.
</P>
<P>
The moderates claim the case was politically motivated withe
the aim to weaken the government of President Khatami, who enjoyed
strong support from Karbaschi and his followers in the
presidential elections in May last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the conservatives attack the moderates for abusing
the freedom and democracy proposed by Khatami, vowing to punish
those who violate the laws.
</P>
<P>
It is believed here that the trial would touch off another
round of political scuffle between the two rival factions, despite

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Discusses Troop Redeployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli cabinet held its weekly
meeting Sunday morning and discussed its troop redeployment in the
West Bank, but no decision was made concerning this matter.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister's Office said that during the meeting, Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denied that Israel is about to sign an
agreement with the Palestinians on the second troop redeployment
in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
He also denied that Israel will not ask the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) to rectify its charter calling for the
destruction of Israel, the Office added.
</P>
<P>
Israel's contacts with the U.S. Administration are continuing
on the troop redeployment issue, particularly on the third stage
troop pullback from the West bank, but so far no decision was made
by the Israel side, Netanyahu was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
During the last several days, local media gave significant
coverage about Israel's decision on the troop redeployment, saying
that Netanyahu has agreed to a 15 percent withdrawal, with 13
percent to be carried out during the second stage and the
remaining 2 percent in the third phase before the two sides enter
into the final status talks.
</P>
<P>
But at its weekly cabinet meeting in Gaza Friday, the PNA
declared that the U.S. proposal of a 13.1 percent redeployment
will not be accepted as an alternative to a complete Israeli
withdrawal from all Palestinian land.
</P>
<P>
PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat told the cabinet that the PNA
accepted the U.S. proposal in principle in order to push the
peace process forward, but the Palestinian side will not abandon
any of the redeployment phases because the only basis that will
allow the peace process to succeed is Israeli withdrawal from all
occupied land.
</P>
<P>
Arafat insisted that the third stage redeployment must include
the entire withdrawal from the West Bank, indicating that he will
not accept the 2 percent which would be counted as the third
pullback.
</P>
<P>
PNA also said the Palestinian National Council had already
amended its charter two years ago and rectified the provisions
calling for the destruction of Israel and there is no need to do
it again.
</P>
<P>
During Sunday's cabinet meeting, officials from the Israel's
General Security Service briefed the ministers on the military
situation in Gaza Strip and the West Bank, suggesting to reopen
the Shuhada Street in the West Bank city of Hebron, which was
closed to traffic due to conflicts between the local Palestinians
and Jewish settlers long time ago.
</P>
<P>
But National Intrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon, who insists
on handing over 9 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians,
opposed the reopening of the street.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Teachers Strike Against Pension Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Israeli teachers
Sunday held a one-day strike to protest against the government's
plan to reform the pension system.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said that about 1 million children were affected
by the strike as the teachers of kindergartens, elementary
schools, junior and high schools walked out of their job.
</P>
<P>
The proposed pension reform would shift the currently
non-contributory pension for teachers to a cumulative pension.
</P>
<P>
Avraham Ben Shabat, secretary-general of the Teachers Union,
said that the reform would hurt the interests of teachers as well
as the educational system.
</P>
<P>
Shabat warned that the opening of the next school year could
be delayed if the government did not changed its stance.
</P>
<P>
But Education Ministry Director-General Ben Zion Dell denounced
the strike, noting that the strike was "unnecessary and
untimely."
</P>
<P>
"Even if their demand regarding the pensions is justified, the
activists are hurting the image of the teachers that the Education
Ministry has been working so hard to nurture," Dell said.

<HEADLINE> EU to Fund China's Biggest Environmental Protection Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
decided to invest 37 million European dollars in China's biggest
environmental protection project in northeast China's Liaoning
Province.
</P>
<P>
Endymion Wilkinson, EU Ambassador on an investigation trip
here, said in an interview with Xinhua that the EU-funded project
is expected to be launched after the EU-Chinese contract is
formally signed on Tuesday during the Chinese Minister of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation Shi Guangsheng's trip to European
Union countries.
</P>
<P>
The five-year project will cover seven sub-projects including
urban development planning for Liaoning's provincial capital of
Shenyang; the administration of water, energy resources and air
quality; and the adjustment of industrial structures.
</P>
<P>
Wilkinson said the EU expects this to become a demonstration
project in China.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning Province has collected 11.5 million European dollars
to launch the EU-funded project.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning is an old industrial base with increasing pollution
problems.
</P>
<P>
An EU consulting company will start its work for the project in
Liaoning this September.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Blames India for Train Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Sunday accused the
Indian intelligence agency of masterminding the train bomb blast
in southern Pakistan, killing 23 and injuring more than 30.
</P>
<P>
The bomb blast in the train Khyber Mail "is obviously an
abominable terrorist act sponsored by (India's) Research and
Analysis Wing (RAW)," the Pakistani Foreign Office said Sunday
afternoon in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
The bomb, reportedly planted in the middle of a carriage, went
off at about 4:10 a.m. (local time) Sunday when the train heading
for the northwestern city of Peshawar was running about 50 km away
from Sukkur, a major city in Pakistan's southern Sindh province.
</P>
<P>
"Continuation of such acts of terrorism and making of innocent
civilians their victims would vitiate the atmosphere for a
constructive engagement for finding solutions to the problems in
the region," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The international community has stressed the necessity for a
dialogue to remove the root cause of the tensions in a nuclearized
South Asia," the statement said. "It is also clearly its
responsibility to denounce such acts of terrorism."
</P>
<P>
This was the second bomb blast in one week in Pakistan. On
Friday, a bomb blasted in a cinema in Lahore, capital of eastern
Punjab province, killing three and injuring one.
</P>
<P>
Last year, nearly 200 people were killed in various incidents
of terrorist and sectarian violence in Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Tehran Mayor Rejects Charges as "Baseless" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein
Karbaschi on Sunday rejected all charges brought against him at
the first session of an open trial of him, calling them "baseless."
</P>
<P>
The charges were read in the court as embezzlement of 14.53
billion rials (about 260,000 U.S. dollars) plus 90,000 dollars, 60
full-priced gold coins and 80 half-priced gold coins, receiving
bribes, mismanagement of public funds, illegitimate ownership of
public properties and fraud.
</P>
<P>
He was also charged with purchasing a building worth 3,800
million rials (about 680,000 dollars) for an un-orthodox institute
and granting 250 million rials (44,643 dollars) to two former
district mayors to fund their election campaigns for the fifth
Majlis (Parliament).
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi defended himself at the open trial which formally
started work Sunday morning at Tehran's special judicial complex
under strict security, with the deployment of hundreds of riot
police equipped with sticks and arms.
</P>
<P>
The trial will last for several days since the case was too
complicated and involved many officials.
</P>
<P>
On April 4, Karbaschi was detained by the conservative
judiciary on multi-charges, but was released 11 days later
following direct intervention from top leaders including President
Mohammad Khatami, former President Hashemi and the supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi was the highest ranking official charged with
embezzlement since the Islamic revolution in 1979. The case
intensified political struggle between the conservatives and
moderates, tipping political factions against each other.
</P>
<P>
The moderates claim the case was politically motivated withe
the aim to weaken the government of President Khatami, who enjoyed
strong support from Karbaschi and his followers in the
presidential elections in May last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the conservatives attack the moderates for abusing
the freedom and democracy proposed by Khatami, vowing to punish
those who violate the laws.
</P>
<P>
It is believed here that the trial would touch off another
round of political scuffle between the two rival factions, despite
that top Iranian leaders have repeatedly called for unity to
"preserve the Islamic principles."

<HEADLINE> Tibet Introduces New Variety of Crops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Tibet Autonomous
Region has introduced 40 kinds of crops in more than 4,540
varieties from the interior areas and overseas in the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account the special needs of growing crops in cold
high-altitude areas, the agriculture department in Tibet launched
a program introducing new crop strains in 1996 and expanding those
varieties fit for the highland through experimentation.
</P>
<P>
Six German wheat varieties such as Bussard, Ritmo and Zentos
have yielded an output of 63 percent to 102 percent more than the
local variety after they were introduced in Lhasa, Nyingchi and
Xigaze.
</P>
<P>
The output of the introduced highland barley and spring wheat
also increased by at least 750 kilograms per hectare.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Tibet autonomous region introduced more than
70 varieties of rape, pea, broad bean and potato.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand Cracks Down on World Cup Gambling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 7 (Xinhua) -- As the World Cup matches are
approaching, Thai police have launched a clamp-down on soccer
gambling operators who are set to earn an estimated 30 billion
baht (about 730 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
This is part of a nationwide campaign against gambling that has
been on the rise in the recent years. Police feared that the World
Cup would add fuel to the gambling fever.
</P>
<P>
Police said gambling fever has spread everywhere -- from
private firms to government offices and from schools to local
banks.
</P>
<P>
With such huge stakes being bet, the notorious underground
lottery bookmakers have temporarily shifted their focus towards
soccer.
</P>
<P>
Police estimated that each gambler in Bangkok alone would spend
an average of 38,880 baht (about 948 dollars) to bet the upcoming
World Cup matches, 35 percent more than the sum during the 1994
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's Central Investigation Bureau Deputy Commissioner
Maj. Gen. Chat Kuldilok acknowledged that lots of lottery
bookmakers had taken up soccer gambling because more money is
being spent on this sport.
</P>
<P>
Chat told reporters that Police Chief Gen. Pracha Promnok had
instructed the police to set up special squads to crack down on
the gambling-related businesses.
</P>
<P>
"We have asked police in each jurisdiction to come up with a
list of people who are involved in the gambling business," Chat
said.
</P>
<P>
But he said clamping-down on such an illegal business was a
daunting task.
</P>
<P>
The Police Department is seeking cooperation from banks, the
Education Ministry, University Affairs Ministry and the mass media
to help monitor the situation.
</P>
<P>
Chat said he had requested the banks to check on "suspicious"
transfers of large amounts of money among their customers.
</P>
<P>
"As for the media, we plead with them not to tacitly support
gambling. I know some of them even suggest betting prices," he
said, referring to newspaper columns which provide insights into
soccer matches.
</P>
<P>
Web sites available for gambling on the Internet also pose a
challenge to police. Education Ministry officials disclosed that
soccer gambling is very popular among students who have easy
access to web sites. Police have difficulty chasing and locating
such "Internet gamblers".
</P>
<P>
The Education Ministry has instructed teachers and rectors of
schools, colleges and universities to help prevent students from
using the Internet to bet on soccer games.
</P>
<P>
Schools in Bangkok have set up campus patrols in a bid to bar
students from sneaking out of their classrooms to wander around
shopping centers, computer game shops and theaters to bet on
soccer matches during the World Cup, a lecturer at Chulalongkhon
University in Bangkok said.
</P>
<P>
"Student patrols are not enough to deal with these students, so
we would like to ask shops to cooperate with us as well," said the
lecturer, who refused to be named.
</P>
<P>
A lottery bookmaker, who gave his name only as Wad, said in an
interview that since the number of his customers "is increasing
rapidly", he had to expand his network by setting up a special
pub. He said however that the pub is exclusively for "old" and
"loyal" customers.
</P>
<P>
He said most of his customers are middle-aged and normally opt
to bet 10,000 baht (244 U.S. dollars) on each match.
</P>
<P>
"We have already screened our customers, so there shouldn't be
any problem. We bet just for fun and most of our clients are
financially sound. We are not destroying the country, or the cash
flow in Thailand,' Wad said.
</P>
<P>
But a police officer, who preferred to be called Paitoon, said
gambling is eroding social morals and destabilizes the society.
</P>
<P>
"We must crack down on this illegal act for the sake of
Thailand," said Paitoon, who is a member of an anti-gambling
squad.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Reorganize Civil Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian government will
conduct a study on the possibility of mobilizing civil servants
from one department to another to cope with the manpower needs of
the public sector, according to the Malaysian national news agency
Bernama Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The staff redeployment plan is to avoid new recruitment in line
with the government's objective to downsize the civil service,
Bernama quoted Chief Secretary to the Government Abdul Halim Ali
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysia Administrative Modernization and Manpower Planning
Unit in the Prime Minister's Department and the Public Services
Department would carry out the study on the optimum manpower
utilization in the civil service, the chief secretary said.
</P>
<P>
He said the study would also identify departments with excess
staff and reassign them to other departments without affecting
their work performance.
</P>
<P>
Manpower in certain areas could be reduced with the advent of
the electronic government, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said certain posts such as for teachers could not
be minimized due to the increasing population and the need to
provide education to the children.
</P>
<P>
He said candidates had been called for interviews to fill
certain vacancies but recruitment had been frozen due to the
economic downturn. "Filling of the vacancies will depend on the
country's economic situation," he added.

<HEADLINE> South Korea to Resume Destroyers-Building Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 7 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's navy may resume its
destroyer-building program later this year, said the Defense
Ministry Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Seeking to secure funds needed for the resumption of the
program named KDX-2, the Ministry draws up a revision to the
supplementary budget, which will be submitted to the National
Assembly in September for approval.
</P>
<P>
The KDX-2 destroyer, with a 30-knot speed and 4,000-mile range,
will be equipped with Harpoon ship-to-ship missiles, ship-to-air
missiles and anti-submarine rockets. It also has a launch pad for
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Under the KDX-2 program, nine 4,300-ton destroyers will be
built by Hyundai and Daewoo within seven to eight years, but the
number of warships to be built will be reconsidered.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the navy was permitted to go ahead with a project of
1,500-ton submarines named SSU.
</P>
<P>
Both the KDX-2 and SSU programs, originally scheduled to start
early this year, were shelved as the Defense Ministry last December
cut their budget due to the nation's ongoing economic woes caused by
corporate bankruptcies and bad loans of financial institutions late
last year.

CAIRO, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are business Briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt is going to promote the sale of state-owned
firms in the Arab world as well through outlets of Egyptian banks
in those countries, Public Enterprise Minister Atef Ebeid said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said only Egyptians would be allowed to subscribe to foreign
trade firms offered for sale, the Egyptian Gazette reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The would-be privatized companies include firms manufacturing
fertilizers, glassware and cement, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt and Sudan signed an agreement Saturday on
irrigation issues, including water conservation and weeds
elimination.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached at the end of the week-long meeting
of a joint Nile board in Cairo, which also called for greater
cooperation between the Nile countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- U.S. oil giant Amoco Corp. and an Egyptian company
have discovered a major oil deposit in the Gulf of Suez that is
being hailed as one of the country's richest finds.
</P>
<P>
The deposit was found at the end of May, an oil ministry
official said.
</P>
<P>
The deposit will "have proven production of 19,500 barrels a
day (bpd), one of the highest in Egypt," the official said, adding
that exploration was continuing in the area.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's total oil production in recent years has averaged
900,000 bpd but it has decided to cut output by 30,000 bpd from
July 1.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Investments in Jordan have increased by 53.9 percent
in the first half of this year over the same period of last year
to reach 131 million Jordanian dinars (about 185 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Director General of the Investment Promotion Corporation
Muntasir Oqleh attributed the rise to the incentives by the
Investment Promotion Law which was endorsed at the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Oqleh said that of the total sum of investments, 52.5 percent
came from non-Arab countries and 23.6 percent from Arab nations in
the region.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran's Pars Wagon Company (PWC) has signed an
agreement with Sudan to produce 500 various types of train wagons
for Khartoum, PWC managing director Ggholamreza Razazi announced
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He told the Iranian official news agency IRNA that the
contract of 25 million U.S. dollars was signed following the

<HEADLINE> Open Trial of Tehran Mayor Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The open trial of Tehran Mayor
Gholamhussein Karbaschi, a moderate technocrat, on graft charges
opened on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The trial started at 09:00 local time (0430 GMT) at Tehran's
special judicial complex, which was surrounded by hundreds of riot
police equipped with sticks and arms.
</P>
<P>
It will last for days and Karbaschi is expected to give
explanations about the activities of the Tehran municipality in
the first session during the day.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi was detained by the conservative judiciary on April 4
on charges of embezzlement, misappropriation of public funds and
mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
The supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei intervened, leading
to the release of the mayor after 11 days in custody.
</P>
<P>
The detention of Karbaschi triggered a conflict between the
conservatives and the moderates, who accuse the former of using
the case to undermine President Mohammad Khatami's government.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives attack the moderates for abusing freedom and
democracy advocated by Khatami and vow to punish those who violate
the laws.
</P>
<P>
About 150 people were present at the court while thousands of
others were permitted to watch the trial through closed circuit
television in a nearby hall.
</P>
<P>
Some 30 correspondents who received special permits were
allowed to enter the court, but many more, particularly foreign
nationals, were barred by court guards from entrancing.
</P>
<P>
People gathered in groups outside the court and debated with
each other over Karbaschi's case, saying that they expect the
mayor will be tried free from political struggle.

<HEADLINE> Kaunda Replaceable: UNIP Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the United National
Independence Party (UNIP) Malimba Masheke has said that UNIP has
capable leaders to take over the party presidency after its
leader Kenneth Kaunda retires from politics.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks two days after Kaunda announced his
intention to quit party politics at the next extraordinary
national congress.
</P>
<P>
He told Sunday Mail Saturday that Kaunda's retirement will not
create a vacuum in the party because it is capable of producing
another crop of leaders to take over the opposition party.
</P>
<P>
Masheke, who has been accused by some UNIP members of being
among a clique plotting to unseat Kaunda, said it is a myth to
say that UNIP will collapse after the departure of the former
president who ruled Zambia since its independence in 1964 until
1991 when he was defeated by current President Frederick Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
"UNIP will find a new leader to take over from Dr. Kaunda just
like what other parties do and that the new leader will come from
within the party and not outside," Masheke said.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the charges made last week by UNIP Secretary
for Information and Publicity Bweendo Mulengela that he is no
longer in charge of the party because of an alleged misuse of
party funds, Masheke maintained that he is still party chairman.
</P>
<P>
He said that he is the only person who is legally empowered to
make statements concerning the party functions.
</P>
<P>
Masheke said that UNIP is consulting on the possibility of
holding a Central Committee meeting next week to be chaired by
Kaunda.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda announced last Thursday he will quit party politics so
that he can serve the nation and the continent on a wider scope.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Bans Tabloids for Publishing Pornography </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government has
suspended the publication of three Kiswahili language tabloids
for persistent carrying pornographic cartoons and articles, state
media said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the Prime Minister's Office Saturday
said the government was forced to make the decision after the
editors of the three newspapers had refused to heed to the
government warnings of not to continue with publications of
pornography.
</P>
<P>
The ban on Chombeza, Arusha Leo and Kasheshe, effective
Saturday, has been imposed in accordance with the Newspaper Act
of 1976 and the Newspaper Regulations of 1977, it said.
</P>
<P>
The press release went on to say that for several times the
editors and owners of the three tabloids have been summoned
before the Registrar of Newspapers for their bad performance. The
registrar has also written letters warning the papers' bad effect
on the general public, especially children.
</P>
<P>
It cited a cartoon on the front page of the Kasheshe,
depicting a suspected rape incident at a university in the city,
saying it sketched the bare genitals of a man, contrary to
newspaper ethics.
</P>
<P>
The Office of the Registrar of Newspapers has received many
complaints from the general public asking it to ban the three
newspapers because they were publishing articles and cartoons
detrimental to the Tanzanian culture.
</P>
<P>
"The government wants to insist the newspapers should respect
the social values in their society and therefore do away with
pornographic articles or cartoons or risk cancellation of their
registration, " the press release said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Platinum Mine Losing $6M Per Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Hartley Platinum Mine near
Harare is losing over six million U.S. Dollars every month due to
unforeseen mining complications, thereby threatening thousands of
workers now deployed with retrenchment or dismissal.
</P>
<P>
Manager for External Affairs of BHP Minerals Zimbabwe Simomo
Mubi confirmed Saturday that the mine, one of the largest
platinum mines in the world and jointly-owned by BHP and Delta
Gold, was currently operating at a negative cash flow lossing an
average of six million U.S. Dollars every month.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Mail quoted Mubi as saying that as a result of the
underground complications, the mine had failed to meet its
production target as the development rates of the main haulage
ways had been below target by over 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Hartley Platinum project, which started about three years
ago, was hailed as the largest investment since independence in
1980.
</P>
<P>
Difficulties being experienced at the mine have been due to a
number of factors which include the loss of developed panels at a
section of mine known as the "South Portal" because of fractured
and weathered ground conditions, Mubi said.
</P>
<P>
"Numerous initiatives have been undertaken to overcome the
problems at Harley Mine," she said, adding that these included
increasing the development of haulage ways to seven days a week
and two blasts per day schedule.
</P>
<P>
Mubi said to enhance individual performance, the ongoing
training and development of miners, tradesmen and supervisors had
been accelerated.
</P>
<P>
The Hartley deposit was estimated to contain 50.9 million tons
of proven and probable reserves of platinum, rhodium, nickel,
palladium, gold and copper and it will produce 150,000 ounces of
platinum a year.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The municipality of Shanghai had
6.39 billion US dollars worth of exports for the January-May
period, up 8.9 percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
A municipal government official says that exports to Asian
countries were down for the period, but those to the United
States, Europe, Latin America and Africa were up, which helped
ease pressures from the Asian financial crisis to some degree.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Shanghai has a goal of 16.3 billion US
dollars worth of exports for 1998, a 10.7-percent increase from
1997.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government is emphasizing market development to
encourage exports and has established a group working on trade
with Africa, to try to have one billion US dollars worth of
exports in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In the first four months, exports of electromechanical,
high-tech, and high value-added products increased, while
traditional exports like textiles and garments were down.
</P>
<P>
Exports of electromechanical products were worth 1.31 billion
US dollars in the January-April period, up 16 percent from the
same period of last year, while high-tech and high value-added
product exports were worth 820 million US dollars, up 51.8
percent. Textile and garment exports were down 8.2 percent and 6.8
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Exports of state-owned export companies and enterprises were
down at least 7 percent from the same period in 1997, while
foreign-funded enterprises exported 3.3 billion US dollars worth
of goods, up 16.7 percent.

SHANGHAI, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese doctors have helped in the
treatment of rheumatism and are becoming leaders in the field.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at Shanghai's Renji Hospital, led by a prominent
professor, Chen Shunle, who was just elected head of a medical
association for the study of rheumatism in the Asia-Pacific
region, have done research on systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
and are moving out in front in rheumatology.
</P>
<P>
The hospital has one of the most advanced medical labs in Asia
and specializes in immunobiology, immunopathology and molecular
biology. The research group has found that the incidence of SLE in
China is 0.07 percent and has successfully cultured an HEP-2 cell
strain for testing antinuclear antibodies, the doctors say.
</P>
<P>
They have also announced that the five-year and ten-year
survival rate of SLE patients is up to 98 percent and 84 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Chen has also developed an effective way to diagnose
diseases of the human immune system by analysing a single drop of
blood.

HAIKOU, June 7 (Xinhua) -- A recent study by China's
Oceanography Bureau showed that 80 percent of the water around the
island province of Hainan is some of the best in China.
</P>
<P>
Hainan has only 34,000 square kilometers of land, but it
controls at least 2 million square kilometers of sea, or two
thirds of China's total.
</P>
<P>
The red tide that hit neighboring Guangdong Province and Hong
Kong recently did not bother Hainan and scientists say that the
ocean around Hainan has not deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
Since it became a province in 1988, Hainan has passed at least
20 regulations for protecting the ocean and 13 marine protection
zones have been set up.
</P>
<P>
Hainan put major industrial projects in the western part of the
province for pollution control and closed 75 enterprises with
severe pollution problems.
</P>
<P>
In the capital, Haikou, which has a population of 600,000, a
sewage treatment plant and equipment for industrial sewage
treatment have been built.
</P>
<P>
The maritime industry is expected to become a major industry
for Hainan because of its abundant marine resources.

<P>
PARIS, June 6 (Xinhua) -- A united Korean team should be
fielded for the next World Cup and a mammoth stadium in the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea's capital used for some of
the games, the outgoing president of soccer's world body said
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
FIFA president Joao Havelange said a joint North-South team had
been a success at the last under-16 world championships in
Portugal and that a similar effort for the World Cup would fulfill
one of the goals of his long-running presidency.
</P>
<P>
"My idea is to unite the two countries on the sports field for
the World Cup in 2002," Havelange said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He said he had visited Pyongyang, DPRK's capital, four
times and seen the construction of a 100,000-seat stadium there.
</P>
<P>
"With a united team, perhaps that stadium could be used for
some matches," Havelange added.
</P>
<P>
South Korea and Japan were picked by FIFA to co-host the 2002
World Cup, the first time soccer's world championship will be held
in two nations.
</P>
<P>
Havelange, who steps down from the FIFA presidency after 24
years at the end of this year's World Cup, also said he hoped to
eventually help stage an exhibition match between Israel and
Palestine in New York.

<HEADLINE> Rampant use of DDT Pollutes Bangladesh's Underground </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The reckless use of DDT and
heptachlor are seriously contaminating the underground water in
Bangladesh's rural areas, creating health hazards for the people,
said a study reaching here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Conducted by the National Minor Irrigation Development Project
in collaboration with the Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission, the
study found the sub-soil water of different regions of the country
having traces of toxic residues of pesticides --DDT and
heptachlor, which are banned and allowed only for restricted use
in this South Asian country.
</P>
<P>
In most cases, heptachlor residues were found to be beyond the
World Health Organization recommended level of 0.03 microgram per
liter.
</P>
<P>
One of the samples contained heptachlor residue of 0.789
microgram per liter while DDT in another sample measured 1.527
microgram per liter, the study stated.
</P>
<P>
The presence of DDT and heptachlor residues indicates that the
contraband highly-toxic pesticides were still being used
indiscriminately in the country.
</P>
<P>
Percolation of carcinogenic pesticides including DDT and
heptachlor into human body might lead to cancer and neurological
problem, the study quoted M.A. Quayum, former chairman of the
Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission, as saying.

WASHINGTON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Olympic medalist speed
skater Nikki Ziegelmeyer, who suffered a spinal injury while
training last year, said Saturday in New York that she will make a
comeback.
</P>
<P>
But the 22-year-old said she will compete in long-track speed
skating, instead of short-track.

"Short-track is too dangerous, " Ziegelmeyer said at a
hospital. "I made it through an injury once and I don't want to
press my luck."
</P>
<P>
She skated into a wall and fractured her vertebrae last October
while training for the Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. Bone
fragments were crushed into her spinal canal, and it wasn't clear
whether she would ever walk again, said Allen Carl, her surgeon.
</P>
<P>
Her injury was the most serious suffered by a U.S. speed
skater. Ziegelmeyer won a bronze medal in the 1994 Winter Olympics
and a silver medal in the 1992 Olympics in short-track skating.

<P>
DHAKA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- About 200,000 Bangladeshis may find
jobs abroad this year, with some 50 percent of them having
already gone to different countries with work, the Labor and
Manpower Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Those abroad have earned about 21.3 billion taka (46.3 million
U.S. dollars) in foreign currency for the country so far this
year, the Financial Express daily reported Sunday, quoting a
ministry source as saying recently.
</P>
<P>
As one of the country's major foreign exchange earners, labor
export earned 1.5 billion dollars during the past 1996-97 fiscal
year ending on June 30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
To create employment opportunities for Bangladeshi people
abroad, Labor and Manpower Minister M.A. Mannan, who is now in
Geneva, is trying to increase demand for Bangladeshi manpower
abroad, and the ministry has sent a letter to Bangladesh high
commissioner to South Africa to find out areas of employment in
Africa, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The same letter has also been issued to labor attaches of
Bangladesh high commissions in ten other countries, including
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, Libya, and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
According to Labor and Manpower Secretary Ahsan Ali Sarker,
some countries such as Singapore were eager to import skilled
manpower. A training center has been set up in the country at the
request of a Singaporean company, he said.

With an area of about 144,000 square kilometers, Bangladesh has
a 127-million population, and a high jobless rate.

<P>
NEW DELHI, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Equities on India's premier
Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) market during the week received a
severe drubbing with the BSE sensitive index showing yet another
sharp fall.
</P>
<P>
The BSE sensitive index tumbled by another 268.50 points to end
the week at 3417.89 as against last weekend's close of 3686.39.
The national index also nose dived by 130.20 points to close the
week at 1513.94 from previous weekend close of 1644.14.
</P>
<P>
The budget for 1998-99 presented to Parliament on June 1 failed
to enthuse investors and the World Bank decided to put on hold all
loans to India. Stocks took a pounding as foreign funds and bulls,
disappointed by budgetary sops for industry, went on a selling
spree.
</P>
<P>
The gloom in the market worsened as the World Bank said last
week it was putting off talks on loans worth 800 million U.S.
dollars to India, and deferring indefinitely two other proposed
loans worth another 200 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the market would have bad days ahead if the 3260
strong support level was broken in the near future.

<HEADLINE> Italy Calls on Eritrea, Ethiopia to Stop Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro
Saturday appealed to the leaders of Eritrea and Ethiopia to stop
all hostilities immediately.
</P>
<P>
In a written message to Eritrean President Isaias Afewerki and
Ethiopian President Negaso Gidada, Scalfaro said that Italy,
former colonial power of the two African countries, was
"profoundly disturbed by the recent tragic events" and was ready
to help them hold peace talks so that the road of mutual
understanding and collaboration could be found once again.
</P>
<P>
He said that Foreign Undersecretary Rino Serri, who would attend
an Organization for African Unity summit in Burkina Faso on
Monday, would meet with the two leaders to seek possible ways of
re-establishing peace.
</P>
<P>
He said when he visited Eritrea and Ethiopia last
November, he "heard talk of the feeling of brotherhood between
people of the two countries, of their close cooperation in all
fields, regional integration, peace and progress for the entire
horn of African region."
</P>
<P>
He was surprised by the fighting between the two nations, which
claimed innocent civilian lives, Scalfaro said.
</P>
<P>
Clashes between Ethiopia and Eritrea have been escalating for
weeks on a border dispute. Saturday morning, Ethiopian planes
bombed Asmara airport for the third time in two days and Eritrean
planes attacked the northern Ethiopian provincial capital of
Makalle, leaving dozens of people dead and over a hundred
injured.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Ethnic-Chinese Citizens Have Equal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
said here Saturday that the ethnic-Chinese community have equal
rights with other indigenous citizens.
</P>
<P>
"Both indigenous and non-indigenous Indonesians have the same
rights and obligations to the state and nation," Habibie told 50
editors of print and electronic media in a dialog forum.
</P>
<P>
A non-indigenous Indonesian who shows his commitment and takes
care of the national interests is much better and more respected
than an indigenous one, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic-Chinese has been targets for violence during times of
hardship in Indonesia in the past several decades. However, the
rioters have never been punished.
</P>
<P>
During the May 13-15 riots in Jakarta and elsewhere last month,
over 5,000 shops and homes of ethnic-Chinese were burned and
looted, and 1,193 people were killed, reports said.
</P>
<P>
There is still deep concern in the Chinese community over the
future, and a key to economic revival will be to attract back the
money from the community that moved out of the country some months
ago, said local English newspaper "The Sunday Observer".
</P>
<P>
According to a report published by the Forum of Reform
Entrepreneurs, about 110,000 families of Chinese descent had left
Indonesia since the riots erupted. Eighty thousand of the families
said they would return if the political and security situations
stabilized, 20,000 were still indecisive, and the remaining 10,000
had decided to move to Singapore and Hong Kong.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- China's increasing population of
seniors and growing demand in rural areas are indicating an
unprecedented opportunities to domestic drug manufacturers,
reports today's "Business Weekly."
</P>
<P>
According to an official with the State Pharmaceutical
Administration (SPA), China has more than 110 million senior
citizens above the age of 60. By year 2000, that figure is
expected to reach 130 million, accounting for 10.6 percent of the
nation's total population.
</P>
<P>
China's 864 million rural residents only accounts for 20
percent of the country's total pharmaceutical consumption. The
official says the increase of living standards in rural areas will
add to the market potential.
</P>
<P>
The pharmaceutical sector is profitable, accounting for 50
percent of all current and planned health care expenditures, and
constituting the largest single share of medical spending.
</P>
<P>
"China has become a major producer of medicines and
pharmaceutical instruments after two decades of continuous growth
averaging 17.5 percent, a rate much higher than in most developed
nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, total output value of the sector topped 120 billion
yuan (14.45 billion US dollars), tripling that of 1978.
</P>
<P>
Besides, China has formulated or revised many national and
professional standards for pharmaceutical products. So far, half
have reached the standards of developed countries, such as the
United States and Japan.

<HEADLINE> CAAC Restricts Air-fare Discounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Heavy losses of domestic airlines
have prompted the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) to
impose restrictions on air-fare discounts on domestic routes and
stop irrational price war of air transport, reported today's
"Business Weekly."
</P>
<P>
The capacity of Air China's Shanghai-Beijing route jumped to
more than 80 percent soon after CAAC set out a 20-percent ceiling
on domestic discounts in late April.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, 11 large domestic airlines
suffered losses totalling 1.7 billion yuan (204 million US
dollars), according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
The "Business Weekly" quoted Air China Vice-President Fu Baoxin
as saying that one of the reasons for the decline is that the
number of available seats "has been slightly higher than demand"
in the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
CAAC wants domestic carriers to forge alliances to lower costs
and improve efficiency.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, this consolidation has been derailed due to
protectionism exercised by local governments," said an official
with a large airline.
</P>
<P>
These local civil aviation companies have gained the upper hand
in the price war because of limited air routes, low operating
costs, flexible management and fewer employees.
</P>
<P>
Participation of foreign airlines on international routes from
and to China has also put a crimp in the earnings of China's big
three airlines: China Southern Airlines, China Eastern Airlines
and Air China.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of the 7.6 million international air
passengers arriving and leaving China used foreign airlines in
1997.
</P>
<P>
However, the domestic aviation industry still has immense
potential, the "Business Weekly" says.
</P>
<P>
Only one out of every 24 people in China travel by air each
year, in sharp contrast to the United States, where on average
each person takes at least two flights a year.

<HEADLINE> China's SEZs Protect Environment Well While Economy Grows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- China's eastern coastal city of
Xiamen, in a time of rapid economic growth, has still managed to
maintain a fine environment, with the quality of air and sea water
up to first grade of the national criteria.
</P>
<P>
One of China's five Special Economic Zones (SEZs), the
131-sq-km island city has witnessed a growth of industrial output
of nearly 40 times in the past two decades without sacrificing the
environment. It has been cited as a national model of
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the State Bureau of Environmental Protection show
that China's first group of six environmental protection models
include three SEZs -- Xiamen, Shenzhen and Zhuhai.
</P>
<P>
Instead of following the old framework of "pollution first and
treatment afterwards" adopted by many countries during their
economic development, China's SEZs have achieved sturdy economic
growth at the minimum environmental cost.
</P>
<P>
Wu Zilin, director of Xiamen's environmental protection
bureau, said the city has always attached great importance to
environmental protection, and no project producing serious
pollution is allowed to be set up there.
</P>
<P>
When Xiamen obtained autonomous legislative power in 1994 the
first local law passed was one on environmental protection, Wu
said.
</P>
<P>
China's largest SEZ, the island province of Hainan, has drawn
up more than 20 laws and regulations on environmental protection
over the past ten years.
</P>
<P>
As all the leading officials of China's SEZs consider a fine
environment to be an important factor in attracting foreign
investment, each SEZ is doing its utmost to protect its
environment.
</P>
<P>
Xiamen injected 2.08 percent of its GDP into environmental
protection last year, compared to 1.85 percent in 1996. The
environmental protection investment is expected to reach three
percent of the city's GDP this year.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen directly poured 773 million yuan (about 93.3 million
US dollars) into environmental protection in the first half of
last year, while Shantou earmarks five million yuan for
environmental protection every year.
</P>
<P>
Wu Zilin said Xiamen's environmental protection efforts have
been rewarded at least in two aspects -- a clean and beautiful
environment its citizens and a steady inflow of foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of April Xiamen had actually
used foreign funds worth 8.12 billion yuan and introduced 4,366
foreign-funded projects.

<HEADLINE> 11 Killed in Philippine Army, Rebels Clash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Eleven people, including five
soldiers, were killed in separate gunbattles Friday between the
Philippine army and Muslim rebels in the southern Philippines, the
newspaper Manila Standard reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Citing military reports, the newspaper said that a patrol team
of the Army's 26th Infantry Battalion was ambushed by a band of
the separatist Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) in Sapad town,
Lanao del Norte province in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Three soldiers were killed and six others wounded in the
ambush, while three guerrillas were reported killed on the MILF
side.
</P>
<P>
The rebel group was led by Kadi Abdullah who reportedly
withdrew into the hinterlands with remnants of his group before
the arrival of reinforcing government troops.
</P>
<P>
In Zamboanga City, capital of Zamboanga province, another
contingent of armymen clashed with another MILF rebel group
Friday, resulting in the death of two troopers, two rebels and a
pregnant woman.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, which has fought for a separate Islamic state in
Mindanao for decades, is currently the strongest anti-government
troops in the Philippines, with an estimated membership of more
than 12,000.
</P>
<P>
The MILF began low-level peace talks with the government in
January 1997, but the two sides have so far failed to reach an
agreement on the timetable for formal peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Trade Needs Participation of Private Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- A senior trade expert recently
suggested that the government allows private companies to
participate more in China's foreign trade, as the Asian financial
crisis has made it more urgent to do so.
</P>
<P>
Qin Xuanren, deputy-secretary general of China Association of
International Trade, told Business Weekly that "the participation
of private foreign trade firms will definitely reinforce China's
foreign trade."
</P>
<P>
He also dismissed the worry that the establishment of private
foreign trade firms will hurt state-owned ones.
</P>
<P>
Qin said a minimum 1.4 percent growth rate for exports must be
reached to ensure this year's national economy of 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
China's state-owned foreign trade firms, which used to be the
backbone of China's exports, are falling short of capacity, and
many of them are suffering from heavy debts, reported today's
"Business Weekly."
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial turmoil, which has caused sluggish import
demand and increased the export competitiveness of the affected
countries, has worsened China's foreign trade situation, the
report says.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, more aggressive foreign-invested companies and
manufacturing enterprises with foreign trade rights have quickly
emerged as the mainstay of China's export industry.
</P>
<P>
Private foreign trade firms will only act as a complement to
their state-owned counterparts, and they can also force
state-owned firms to reform their operation, the "Business Weekly"
quoted Qin as saying.
</P>
<P>
Private firms will be mainly engaged in the import and export
of goods like shoes, clothes and toys, while state-owned ones will
control the bulk of large electronics and machinery products, such
as planes and ships, he suggested.

<HEADLINE> Yunnan Purifies Scenic Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The water quality of Dianchi Lake,
a major scenic spot just outside this capital of southwest China's
Yunnan Province and the sixth-largest freshwater lake in China, is
expected to be considerably improved by the year 2000, according
to a city official.
</P>
<P>
A major source of water for Kunming, the lake has been polluted
by increasing amounts of industrial and domestic sewage water in
recent years. Official figures show that 50,000 tons of waste
water flows into the lake each day.
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the '99 World Garden Exposition, to be held
here from May to October next year, Yunnan has earmarked a large
amount of money to clean up Dianchi Lake, an effort that is
supported by the central authorities and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The purification project, estimated to cost 2.6 billion yuan
including 150 million US dollars in World Bank loans, includes
building and renovating five sewage-disposal plants and the
construction of an lake-environment monitoring system.
</P>
<P>
After the completion of the project in May 1999, Kunming's
sewage water disposal rate will exceed 80 percent and the amount
of pollutants deposited in the lake will be reduced by 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
Besides the main project, several subsidiary projects involving
the installation of pipelines and the building of pumping stations
have also been started to help improve the overall environment and
ecology in the lake area.

<HEADLINE> Russia Beats Australia to Play for Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia, who disqualified for last
championship four years ago, survived a strong comeback and
revenged Australia 82-76 Saturday, advancing to the final at the
Women's World Basketball Championship.
</P>
<P>
This was a repeat game of the Atlanta Olympic semi-final in
1996 when Australia edge Russia by four points, 74-70.
</P>
<P>
"This is our best game at this World Championship" said Elena
Baranova, who led the Russians with 25 points, 14 rebounds and 4
assists. "We have improved game by game and are playing our best
World Championship for a long time. We defeated the Australians
by our strong defense."
</P>
<P>
The WNB star was surported by Elena Pshikova's 22 points
including five 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
Russia will meet with another semi-final winner between the
United States and Brazil in Sunday's final.
</P>
<P>
"We are capable of producing the unforced errors, we will have
a good chance in tomorrow's final," said Evgueny Gomelksy, the
famous Russian head coach.
</P>
<P>
"Australia has a very good team. They put us under pressure for
a long time by their pressing defense. I think Australia will be
even stronger in two years and has a good chance to win the gold
medal at the Olympics."
</P>
<P>
Russia started with a 19-11 lead only six minutes 29 seconds
into the game, but was surpassed 24-23 on Lauren Jackson's
straight six points with 7:34 to play in the first half.
</P>
<P>
Then game leveled four times and changed several time in scores
with a 36-36 halftime equal.
</P>
<P>
It seemed Russia could win without the problem after forward
Elena Pshikova hit her fifth 3-pointers to promote the Russians'
advantage to 60-44 with 10:39 left.
</P>
<P>
Australia, fourth place finisher four years ago at home and
Olympic bronze midalist, fired two spurts in the span of less than
eight minutes to narrowed the margin by only two points for 74-76.
</P>
<P>
But the well-coached Russian team finally prevented from their
opponents' last rally to seal the berth of the gold medal final.
</P>
<P>
Forward Michelle Griffiths was the top scorer for Australia
with 17 points while Michele Timms scored 14.
</P>
<P>
"Russian scored in 50 percent of their shots, we only in 30
percent. In addition, the Russians dominated the rebounds,"
Australian coach Tom Maher said.
</P>
<P>
"They have good players, a well-balanced team. Contrary to my
team, they shot very well and successfully," the Austrlian coach
added.

night.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Nips Paraguay in World Cup Warm-up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Second-half Belgian substitute
Enzo Scifo ended 56 minutes of agitating wait with the lone goal
of Saturday's World Cup warm-up game with Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
The goal handed the Red Demons the win of their seventh and
last tune-up game. The Belgians wound up their preparation series
with three wins, as many draws against one defeat.
</P>
<P>
The first-half team seemed unable to shake off the doldrums it
sank into during the second half on Wednesday when they scored two
goals in the first 45 minutes to lead Colombia in another warm-up
match.
</P>
<P>
Scifo and Emile Mpenza, the new blood up front and in midfield
as match resumed, quickened the tempo of play that soon tore open
the hitherto well-pitched defense by the South Americans.
</P>
<P>
In the 56th minute, Scifo picked up a forward pass from back
court and dribbled toward the right side of the penalty area
before thundering a shot that deflected off an opposing defender
only to land in the upper corner of the goal.
</P>
<P>
Scifo told the press after the match that the tempo of play was
too slow and the Belgians had problems in gearing up their speed.
But he said he was satisfied with his goal and the win.

BERLIN, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States overcame a slow
start to pull away in the second half and trounced defending
champions Brazil 93-79 Saturday night to book the berth of the
gold medal final with Russia at the Women's World Basketball
Championship.
</P>
<P>
Russia squeezed past Australia 82-76 earlier Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The semi-final of the Americans and Brazilians is a rematch of
the last championship's semifinal in Sydney when Brazil, headed by
super star Hortencia Marcari Oli, edged the American side 110-107.
</P>
<P>
Both also met in the final of the Atlanta Olympic women's
basketball tournament in 1996 with the host taking the gold.
</P>
<P>
Five Americans scored double-figures with Lisa Leslie, Natalie
Williams and Ruthie Bolton 16 points each.
</P>
<P>
36-year-old Maria Paula tossed in 25 points to lead the
Brazilian team and Arcatin Janeth added 24.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which won the bronze at last tournament,
trailed 7-14 five minutes into the game and 44-45 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
The game was still hard to be decided before the score tied
55-55. No sooner, the Americans found the basket and defensive
zoon and used a 18-4 charge for 73-59, almost ensuring the
victory, with 8:44 remaining.

WASHINGTON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Hackers entered U.S. Army
computers last week and altered a command's Web site, The U.S.
Army said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Army spokesman Gerry Gilmore was quoted by the Associated Press
as saying, "Evidently they went through some Army organization's

</P>
<P>
Gilmore said the hackers apparently got into the Army's
computers Thursday through its Dental Command system at Fort Sam
Houston, Texas.
</P>
<P>
Gilmore said the home page, the title page, was altered. But He
would not elaborate on the type of information the hackers gained
or if U.S. security was compromised.
</P>
<P>
Gilmore also did not comment about whether the hackers used the
Army access to enter the Indian government computers.
</P>
<P>
Days earlier, computer hackers claimed to have entered India's
national security computer network and stolen sensitive nuclear
weapons secrets.
</P>
<P>
They also said in an interview with the online magazine Wired
News that they altered a World Wide Web site there.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Jim Turner said that "the appropriate
authorities are looking into it." The FBI and the Army were
investigating the matter.
</P>
<P>
The six hackers, who call themselves the MilwOrm Group, said
they are 15-18 years old and hail from the United States, England,
the Netherlands and New Zealand. They claim to have accessed
electronic mail messages sent between India's nuclear scientists
and Israeli government officials as well as downloaded sensitive
documents, the Associated Press report said.
</P>
<P>
They also altered the Web site of the Bhabha Atomic Research
Center, the nerve center of India's nuclear programs, they said in

MOSCOW, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
deeply concerned over the nuclear tests conducted by India and
Pakistan, on Saturday urged India to sign the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>

In a telephone conversation with Indian Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee, Yeltsin said that the Indian-Pakistani nuclear
competition has spread far beyond the region. It undermines the
nuclear non-proliferation regime and sets a dangerous precedent of
nuclear weapons spread.
</P>
<P>
In view of India's present position on nuclear testing and the
disarmament talks in Geneva, the Russian president stressed the
need for New Delhi to take further positive steps in this
direction.

The two leaders also discussed possible forms that Russia
directly promotes a dialogue between India and Pakistan.

Chinese Ambassador to the United Nations on Saturday.

Qin made the remarks at the Security Council meeting which was
held to adopt a resolution condemning the nuclear tests by India
and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"In total disregard of the opposition and protest of the
international community, India conducted nuclear tests on May 11
and 13, thus bringing tension suddenly to the South Asian
Subcontinent. Then, Pakistan carried out its own nuclear tests,"
Qin said.
</P>
<P>
"Under the present circumstances, what is most urgent, in our
view, is to take measures to call on india and Pakistan to
exercise restraint, stop all further nuclear tests, abandon
their nuclear weapons development programmes, be committed to
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty immediately and unconditionally," Qin
said.
</P>
<P>
"The resolution adopted by the Security Council this morning
has fully confirmed the importance of the two treaties and the
determination of the international community to continue to
adhere to the treaties, and made corresponding demand of the two
countries in explicit terms. This is extremely right and
necessary thing to do," the Ambassador added.

<HEADLINE> China Calls on India, Pakistan to Solve Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Regarding the issue of
Kashmir, India and Pakistan should look for a solution to their
disputes in accordance with the principles enshrined in relevant
U.N. resolutions and the Simla Agreement and through peaceful
negotiations, Qin Huasun, Chinese Ambassador to the United
Nations, said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Qin made the remarks at the Security Council meeting
which was held this morning to adopt a resolution concerning the
nuclear tests by India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"The recent nuclear tests have also further strained the
bilateral relations between India and Pakistan, and undermined the
relative peace and stability in the Subcontinent," said the
Ambassador.
</P>
<P>
"What is worrisome is that the two countries have once again
entered into military engagement in Kashmir. There is no doubt
that escalation of the Kashmir dispute will further deteriorate
the situation, which will not only bring untold sufferings to the
two countries and their peoples, but inevitably endanger the peace
and stability in the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
"China calls upon India and Pakistan to be calm and
restrained, to restore talks between them, to halt any statements
or movements that may further escalate the tensions, and to
refrain from an arms race," Qin said.
</P>
<P>
"In Kashmir, they should respect and stick to the control
line, and they shall, under no circumstances, step across the
control line, or seek to change the state of affairs in the
region unilaterally," Qin stressed.
