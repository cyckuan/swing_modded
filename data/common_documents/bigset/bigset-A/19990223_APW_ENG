<HEADLINE> Coke Buys Half of Peru Soft Drink </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- The Coca-Cola Co. has bought half of Peru's  
Inca Kola, a beverage that may be one of the few soft drinks in the 
world to outsell Coke in its own domain. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said Coke has long wanted to purchase the cola that  
incites patriotism in many Peruvians. Coke called the purchase a 
``strategic partnership,'' not a takeover as some citizens had 
feared. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale was announced Tuesday at a news conference.  
</P>
<P>
	Coke bought 50 percent of Inca Kola while the family that has  
run the company for 89 years will retain 50 percent. Coke is also 
buying 20 percent of Inca Kola's Lima bottler. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke will lead global marketing and sales of Inca Kola, while  
operations inside Peru will be run as a joint venture between the 
partners, said Timothy Haas, president of Coke's Latin American 
subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials would not say how much Coca Cola paid.  
</P>
<P>
	``Inca Kola has a great symbolic importance because Peru is one  
of the few countries in the world where Coca-Cola is not the No. 1 
soft drink,'' said Michael Flit, beverage analyst for Banco de 
Credito, Peru's largest bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Inca Kola and Inca Kola Diet account for 30 percent of soft  
drink sales in Peru, and Coca-Cola and Coca-Cola Light 28 percent, 
Flit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke officials say their figures show that Coca-Cola soft  
drinks, which include Sprite and Fanta, have 34 percent of the 
Peruvian market compared to 32 percent for Inca Kola products. 
</P>
<P>
	The partial sale and uncertain future of Inca Kola threatens to  
stir a nationalist reaction in Peru, where many people drink the 
ultra-sweet, bubble gum-like beverage out of patriotism. 
</P>
<P>
	To ease such fears, Coke officials said they will not change  
Inca Kola but instead will use their international sales network to 
boosts sales around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Inca Kola is sold in 18 U.S. states, Ecuador, Japan and Europe.

<HEADLINE> GM Resurrects 50-Year-Old Jingle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. will resurrect one of its  
most famous advertising jingles, ``See the USA in your Chevrolet,'' 
as part of a patriotic brand-image campaign aimed at reversing the 
slump in car sales at its biggest division. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevrolet's goal is to once again become the top-selling  
automotive brand in the United States with the best-selling car 
within five years, marketing general manager Kurt Ritter said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	It has a way to go: Chevy's car sales fell nearly 11 percent  
last year to 876,432, compared with 1,069,329 cars sold by Ford 
Motor Co.'s Ford division. Chevy's top-selling car, the Cavalier, 
ranked No. 6 in the industry last year with 256,099 sold, well 
behind the top-selling Toyota Camry at 429,575. 
</P>
<P>
	From the 1950s through the '70s, Chevy was the undisputed U.S.  
sales king. But in the past two decades, ``the hunter and the 
hunted have reversed roles,'' Ritter said, as Chevrolet has found 
itself chasing Japan's Toyota Motor Corp., Honda Motor Co. and 
longtime domestic rival Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevy last held the U.S. car-sales crown in 1991. It last had a  
No. 1 car, the Celebrity, in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	The division is reaching back to the '50s for the ``See the  
USA'' jingle, made famous by entertainer Dinah Shore, who sang it 
at the start and end of her weekly television variety show that ran 
from 1951 to 1963. It was written 50 years ago and used for all 
Chevy-sponsored radio and TV programs of that era. 
</P>
<P>
	In the new commercial, which debuts Wednesday night on the  
Grammy Awards show on CBS, the refrain is repeated by singer Shawn 
Colvin over a video montage of pop culture Americana. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevrolet wants the new image campaign to do for its cars what  
the 7-year-old ``Like a Rock'' campaign has done for its truck line 
-- provide a consistent brand identity. The idea is to link Chevy 
cars with mainstream American values, much as the ``Baseball, hot 
dogs, apple pie and Chevrolet'' campaign of the 1970s did. 
</P>
<P>
	Wes Brown, an industry analyst with the California consulting  
firm Nextrend, said it makes sense for Chevrolet to tap into 
nostalgia and its heritage to lure customers. But it can lead to 
more sales only if the cars in the showroom match the expectations 
the ads create. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything that brings back the heyday of GM and Chevrolet can  
definitely help,'' Brown said. ``The down side of that is when you 
look at some of the cars out there today -- and not just Chevrolets 
-- they don't have the presence that their cars used to. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't back it up with product, the campaign means  
nothing.''

<HEADLINE> Slovenia's Pretnar Wins Slalom Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARE, Sweden (AP) -- Spela Pretnar got her motivation back after  
yet another heartbreaker. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 13, the young Slovenian straddled a gate near the  
finish, probably costing her a slalom medal in the World Ski 
Championships at Vail, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was maybe the toughest moment in my life because I was 100  
percent sure to get a medal,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday night, Pretnar enjoyed one of the brightest moments  
of her career, winning her first World Cup slalom under the lights 
in northern Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	She was ninth, but only .58 seconds off the leader's pace, after  
the first run. Still, she didn't like her chances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think I'd win when I came into the finishing area  
because there were another eight racers on the top who skied faster 
in the first run,'' Pretnar said. ``That's maybe why I wasn't so 
happy when I came down. I didn't believe I could win. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was tough to get the motivation back after the World  
Championships. I told my coaches that I felt like I didn't ski with 
my heart anymore. I felt like a machine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pretnar, who turns 26 next week, won her only previous World Cup  
race in 1995, a giant slalom at Bormio, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months later, while training in Austria, she broke her left  
leg for the fourth time. She needed almost two years to recover 
from that bad spill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought about quitting many times,'' she recalled ``But I  
decided to continue and I trained really hard. A lot of people 
helped me. This season we had new coaches. I'm happy for them as 
well because they were waiting for this victory as much as I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pretnar had a combined time of 1 minute, 26.93 seconds down  
Gastrappet, the only illuminated slalom and giant slalom course in 
the world approved by the International Ski Federation (FIS). She 
earned her first podium finish of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Trine Bakke of Norway, the bronze medalist at Vail who led after  
the first run, finished second, .18 seconds behind. Anja Paerson, 
the 17-year-old Swedish sensation, was third, .25 behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow Swede Pernilla Wiberg, runnerup in the world championship  
slalom, was another one-hundredth behind in fourth place. Sabine 
Egger of Austria wound up ninth, but still has a 425-415 lead over 
Wiberg going into the final slalom of the season at Sierra Nevada, 
Spain, next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Zali Steggall of Australia, the slalom gold medalist at Vail,  
tied for sixth with Sweden's Ylva Nowen, the reigning World Cup 
slalom champion who is winless this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Misfortune continued for Kristina Koznick of the United States,  
last year's winner here. She missed a gate in the second run after 
only about 15 seconds and was disqualified. Koznick, who did the 
same thing in the world championship slalom, crossed her ski tips 
near a gate, hitting several photographers and spectators as she 
crashed. 
</P>
<P>
	The American placed sixth in the first run, only .19 off Bakke's  
pace. A year ago, Koznick captured her first World Cup slalom here 
and she also scored her first World Cup points in this northern 
Swedish resort six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicknamed the ``Queen of the Night,'' Koznick, who grew up  
skiing at night on a little hill called Buck Hill near Burnsville, 
Minn., won her two World Cup slaloms at night. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexandra Meissnitzer of Austria, who won Monday's giant slalom  
here, leads Hilde Gerg of Germany 1,430 points to 983 in the 
overall standings. Meissnitzer did not compete in the slalom, but 
was scheduled to return tonight for another giant slalom.

<HEADLINE> J Peterman Bankruptcy Plans OK'd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Catalog retailer J. Peterman will go out  
of business after failing to find a potential buyer. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge on Tuesday approved plans for the company to  
liquidate its assets and begin going-out-of-business sales. 
Peterman has been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy court 
protection since Jan. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes you pull it out in the ninth inning, sometimes you  
don't,'' said John Peterman, who founded the off-beat catalog in 
1987. ``I was here at the beginning, and I'm here at the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company became a household name when it was parodied on the  
top-rated television comedy ``Seinfeld.'' During the show's final 
three seasons, ending last May, the character Elaine Benes worked 
for J. Peterman. 
</P>
<P>
	Early last year, John Peterman embarked on an ambitious retail  
expansion that included plans for 50 stores and 20 catalog outlets. 
He recruited outside executives, raised $10 million from private 
investors and made plans to target upscale markets. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the year, though, there were layoffs and a freeze  
on new store openings, followed last month by the bankruptcy 
filing. 
</P>
<P>
	An auction of assets was scheduled for March 5 and Peterman said  
the company would stop taking telephone orders Wednesday. Peterman 
is looking for a liquidator to run the final sales at its 13 retail 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 400 employees will lose their jobs.  
</P>
<P>
	Peterman, who has said he plans to write a ``tragically  
humorous'' book about his experiences, said he was unsure what 
would happen if another company tried to buy the J. Peterman name 
at the March 5 auction. 
</P>
<P>
	``My name is John Peterman and John Peterman is J. Peterman,''  
he said. ``We'll see what happens, but the two can't be separated 
too easily.''

<HEADLINE> Canseco Misses First Day of Drills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Spring training is here, and the big  
bat the Tampa Bay Devil Rays want in the middle of their lineup is 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Canseco, who has a history of reporting late, was a no-show  
Tuesday when the team held its first full-squad workout. Adding to 
the club's consternation was the fact that no one had heard from 
the slugger. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, it's irritating a little bit because he's such a big cog  
of the wheel,'' general manager Chuck LaMar said. ``Jose's going to 
show up when Jose's ready. And I guess that's what bothers me the 
most. If it was injury or visa problems or personal problems or 
irritation over a contract or a trade that just materialized, then 
that's one thing. But just to premeditatively not show up for a 
couple of days -- if that's the case -- is a different story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Tuesday was the voluntary reporting date, players aren't  
required to be in camp until March 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest need we had was right-handed power,'' LaMar said.  
``We went out and got a right-handed power hitter, and we're 
thrilled to have him. He's going to have a heck of a year. But I 
wish he was here today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco, who had 46 homers and 107 RBIs for the Toronto Blue  
Jays last season, signed with the Devil Rays as a free agent this 
winter. Tampa Bay finished near the bottom of the American League 
in most major offensive categories in 1998 and is counting on 
Canseco to make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
	LaMar and manager Larry Rothschild were hoping that Canseco, who  
talked about how much he wanted to play for Tampa Bay when he 
signed a one-year contract that guarantees him $3 million, would be 
eager to get started. 
</P>
<P>
	A .266 hitter with 397 homers in 13 major league seasons,  
Canseco frequently has arrived late for camp during a career that's 
included stints with the Blue Jays, Oakland Athletics, Texas 
Rangers and Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to make too big of an issue of it ... A lot of  
major league camps go through this. But very candidly, it's the 
first time we've gone through it,'' LaMar said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 74 other players in camp, and that's what Rothschild  
preferred to focus on. Besides Canseco, the only player missing was 
injured infielder Herbert Perry. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are so many positive things going on that I'd rather  
concentrate on,'' the manager said. ``Jose will catch up when he 
gets here ... I don't anticipate that it's going to be a major 
problem.''

<HEADLINE> Palmer, Vikings OK Four-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Kick returner and third-down  
specialist David Palmer has agreed to re-sign with Minnesota for 
four years 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is worth $7.35 million, including a $1.6 million  
signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, a second-round draft pick by the Vikings in 1994, had  
scheduled visits to Miami and Baltimore this week, but canceled 
them after agreeing to terms. His agent, Russ Campbell, said he is 
likely to wait until March 1 to sign the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Palmer became the first Viking since Herschel  
Walker in 1989 to return a kickoff for a touchdown, and he broke 
Eddie Payton's 1980 team record for combined kick and punt return 
yardage, with 1,435 yards. On offense, he caught 18 passes for 185 
yards and rushed 10 times for 52 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dennis Green said free safety Orlando Thomas is the last  
unrestricted free agent the Vikings are working to get under 
contract. They have lost fullback Charles Evans to Baltimore and 
cornerback Corey Fuller to Cleveland and re-signed linebacker Ed 
McDaniel.

<HEADLINE> Prominent Nigerian woman Wins Seat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) -- The strong cheekbones and broad smile are  
reminiscent of her late father, one of Nigeria's most famous sons. 
But the feminist fervor is distinctly her own. 
</P>
<P>
	``I give God the credit for my success,'' Lola Abiola-Edowar  
told a crowd of supporters outside her two-story British 
colonial-style house after winning a seat Saturday in the House of 
Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	In a country where women have long been relegated to the  
political fringe, the daughter of Moshood Abiola, the billionaire 
politician who died in military detention last year, is breaking 
new ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory in her home constituency in the Lagos neighborhood  
of Apapa ushered her into a tiny club -- in recent years, women have 
held less than 1 percent of Nigeria's legislative seats. 
</P>
<P>
	The elections, in which Nigeria's largest Peoples Democratic  
Party won a majority of the 109 Senate and 360 House of 
Representatives seats, were a preview to this weekend's 
presidential vote. That ballot completes the democratic transition 
from military to civilian rule for Africa's most populous nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The PDP's retired Gen. Olsegun Obasanjo is expected to defeat  
coalition candidate Olu Falae, a former finance minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike her father, who campaigned against the military and was  
jailed after the army aborted the 1993 presidential election he 
appeared poised to win, Abiola-Edowar is fighting a different 
struggle -- to be taken seriously by the male political 
establishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``If parties want votes, they need to realize that women make up  
a majority in Nigeria,'' Abiola-Edowar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, she's pragmatic enough to know that basing a campaign on  
women's rights would not get her very far in today's Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the time comes, I will push for more women's rights,''  
she said with a smile. ``We have to be realistic. But we're going 
to get there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, she is concentrating on issues such as equal treatment  
for members of Nigeria's 250 ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Abiola-Edowar would like to follow her father into presidential  
politics, but concedes that ``women in Nigeria face serious 
handicaps'' that could keep her from that goal. 
</P>
<P>
	While she insists her Alliance for Democracy party has not  
discriminated against her, examples abound of the unequal treatment 
of women in politics. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's wing of Obasanjo's PDP -- the Alliance's main rival --  
threatened to defect after the party barred women delegates from 
nominating a candidate earlier this month. Instead, they were asked 
to serve food. 
</P>
<P>
	In her late 30s, Abiola-Edowar has the same charismatic charm  
and engaging smile as her father, who amassed a business empire of 
publishing houses and contract companies for successive Nigerian 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are differences: He was a Muslim, she is a Christian.  
He spoke haltingly, in proverbs that often perplexed his listeners. 
She speaks easily, like a seasoned politician. 
</P>
<P>
	Abiola-Edowar readily admits she benefits from her famous name  
and the privileges that go with it. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike her father, who had a modest upbringing, she grew up in  
wealth, the eldest daughter among dozens of children by his many 
wives and mistresses. 
</P>
<P>
	She was partly educated in Britain and married a Lagos  
millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
	``My father's shoes are very big to fill. And I will probably  
always be following them,'' she says.

<HEADLINE> GOP Moderate Wins Gingrich's Seat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Three months after the resignation of Newt  
Gingrich, constituents of Georgia's 6th District still have a 
Republican as their congressman -- but Johnny Isakson is a far cry 
from the combative former House speaker. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always been one to build consensus,'' Isakson said  
Tuesday night after his overwhelming victory in the nonpartisan 
special election for Gingrich's seat. ``I believe you make progress 
wherever you can find common ground and that's what I'm going to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Isakson, a moderate known for his ability to cooperate with  
Democrats, easily defeated six other opponents. With all precincts 
reporting, Isakson had 51,548 votes, or 65 percent, followed by 
Kennesaw State University professor Christina Jeffrey with 20,116 
votes, or 26 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Pelphrey, the lone Democrat on the ballot, had 4,014 votes,  
or 5 percent. No other candidate had more than 2 percent of the 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Isakson avoided a runoff by winning more than a majority of the  
vote in the staunchly Republican suburban Atlanta district. 
</P>
<P>
	Isakson, a former state legislator, was most recently appointed  
chair of the state school board by then Gov. Zell Miller, a 
Democrat, to help quell differences between the Republican school 
superintendent and the Democratic board. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Ms. Jeffrey acknowledged Isakson's crossover appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	``We pulled in the Republican votes we thought we would,'' said  
Ms. Jeffrey, who was hired and then fired as House historian by 
Gingrich in 1995 amid controversy over her review of a Holocaust 
course. ``But the Democrats figured Johnny was the best they were 
going to get and mobilized for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Isakson, a 54-year-old Marietta real estate millionaire,  
represented Cobb County in the Georgia Legislature for 17 years. In 
1990, he was the GOP's nominee for governor, losing to Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich gave up his seat after his party's poor showing in the  
November elections. He encouraged Isakson to run, but stopped short 
of an endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
	Isakson received nearly $1 million in donations to fund his  
campaign, dwarfing his rivals. He said he would not be as 
confrontational or as partisan as Gingrich was in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will seek out consensus and not divisiveness,'' Isakson  
said. ``There are principles we are all interested in -- lowering 
the national debt and lowering taxes ... and if Congress does not 
get together and do it, there will be a lot of turnover in the next 
election.''

<HEADLINE> Olympic Sponsors Still Skittish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- While sponsors of the 2002 Winter Games  
wait to see if the International Olympic Committee cleans house, 
some are wary about a new prospect for Salt Lake's organizers: too 
much openness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the sponsors are worried about too much oversight, too  
much government control that hampers the ability to put on the 
games,'' said Robert Garff, chairman of the Salt Lake Organizing 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	A new era of openness and ethics was heralded by the SLOC during  
its Feb. 11 purge and reorganization following revelations that 
executives during the city's bidding days went overboard while 
courting IOC member votes. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigating panel earlier this month said two executives  
unethically gave more than $1 million worth of cash payments, 
vacations, free medical care, bogus scholarships and shopping 
sprees to IOC members and their families. The IOC voted in June 
1995 to give Salt Lake the 2002 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ensuing reorganization, the SLOC's board endorsed the  
concept of having all meetings and documents presumed open unless 
there is good reason to keep them secret; added two top lawmakers 
to its policy board; and called for trustees with conflicts of 
interest to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of them -- two ski resort owners and the owner of a  
construction company that is building the roof for the 
speed-skating oval -- resigned that week. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsors had called for an end to conflicts of interest on the  
board and generally lauded the reforms. But they hope they don't go 
too far. 
</P>
<P>
	``We understand the desire to make a good bit of this open as  
long as the integrity of negotiations are kept intact,'' said Julie 
Davis, a spokeswoman for NationsBank. 
</P>
<P>
	NationsBank, based in North Carolina, is expected to pay $50  
million to sponsor the 2002 Games and every U.S. Olympic team 
through 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank also is extending a $170 million line of credit to the  
SLOC. The bank's sponsorship name will eventually change to Bank of 
America to reflect last year's merger. 
</P>
<P>
	The finer points of the relationship will continue to be  
negotiated, and that should not be in public, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just not good business practice,'' she said. ``From our  
perspective you're giving out competitive information and from 
SLOC's perspective it could hurt their negotiating position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garff said the tension stems from the fact that Olympic  
organizations in the past were mostly private. 
</P>
<P>
	``Decisions have to be made every day. ... If we have to go  
through five layers, that's what the banks are concerned about,'' 
Garff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers are also dishing out some heartburn.  
</P>
<P>
	While the organizing committee tries to assure sponsors of  
confidentiality, lawmakers pass bills such as one that sailed 
through the House on a 70-0 vote last week. It would open many of 
the organizers' contemporary internal records to anyone who asks 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public is saying we want openness and we've come back and  
said, `But the private sponsors want confidentiality,''' Garff 
said. ``We have to be free to manage the games in a classic 
(not-for-profit) fashion and not at the Legislature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though it's a balancing act between the public's right to know  
and corporate sponsors' need for confidentiality, it's not as if 
they're on opposite sides, Garff said. ``Sponsors want the public 
happy. That's why they do it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, US West, which is providing the games with $60 million  
in cash and services, welcomes greater openness. ``There wasn't 
enough of that before,'' said spokesman Michael Frandsen. 
</P>
<P>
	US West in January temporarily withheld a $5 million payment,  
and paid up only when it was convinced real reform was under way. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's conceivable the pendulum could swing too far, but we're  
not there yet,'' Frandsen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC has $370 million more to raise from corporate  
sponsorships -- some of it cash and some goods and services. The 
goal had been to line up all the sponsors by August, but marketing 
officials say the scandal could push that back as much as a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitt Romney, the new chief executive, says he plans to recruit  
executives with Utah ties to act as ambassadors to potential 
sponsors and Romney himself will take a more active role in sponsor 
recruitment. 
</P>
<P>
	Lining up sponsors is really the job of OPUS, a joint venture  
with the U.S. Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think this is an important enough endeavor that you want  
all hands on deck,'' Romney said earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that we will be speaking to the USOC more and more  
about how we will interrelate,'' Garff said. ``We'll take a little 
stronger role, and I think they would welcome us to, so they don't 
have all the pressure on them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Krimsky, OPUS president and deputy secretary general of the  
USOC, did not return phone calls seeking comment Monday and 
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Braves' Klesko Back at First Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KISSIMMEE, Fla (AP) -- Ryan Klesko went back to his roots  
Tuesday, pulling a first baseman's glove out of the locker. Now, if 
only he could fill Andres Galarraga's shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming off the worst season of his major league career, Klesko  
assumed the unenviable task of trying to replace Galarraga as the 
Atlanta Braves held their first full-squad workout of spring 
training. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're missing a big hitter in our lineup and a great person,''  
Klesko said. ``I'll go out there and give it 100 percent and do my 
best, like I have since I've been with this organization. That's 
all I can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga, who hit .305 with 44 homers and 121 RBIs last year,  
is undergoing treatment for a cancerous tumor in his back and will 
miss the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
	Klesko, whose future with the team was in doubt just a week ago  
after a disappointing 18-homer, 70-RBIs performance, suddenly finds 
himself in a prominent role as the Braves set their sights on an 
eighth straight postseason appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	A first baseman throughout his minor-league career, his path was  
blocked once he got to Atlanta -- first by Fred McGriff, then by 
Galarraga. So Klesko shifted to left field, where he transformed 
himself from a defensive Marine (``It's not just a job, it's an 
adventure'') to an average outfielder who made only one error last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not too many guys can say that,'' Klesko said proudly. ``I  
play aggressive, and you usually make errors when you play 
aggressive. But fortunately, I didn't make any last year except for 
one throwing error.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately for Klesko, he underwent an appendectomy in June  
and never seemed to get on track as a hitter. His power numbers, in 
fact, have been dwindling since he had 34 homers and 93 RBIs in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Braves signed free agent outfielders Otis Nixon and  
Brian Jordan, there was speculation that Klesko's days in Atlanta 
were numbered. He shrugged off the trade rumors, saying ``I've been 
going through that forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't worry about it anymore,'' said the 27-year-old Klesko,  
entering his 11th season with the Braves organization. ``When I was 
younger, I used to think, `Boy, I would hate to leave. I wonder who 
I'm going to get traded to.' Now, if it happens, it happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Klesko dropped to 24 homers and 84 RBIs in 1997, then fell even  
further last season. Though he cut his strikeouts nearly in half 
(130 to 66) and had a career-high 29 doubles, this 6-foot-3, 
220-pounder is built to hit homers and drive in runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last two years have been tougher because I've had some  
wrist problems,'' he said. ``I didn't have the power in the alleys 
like I used to have. I couldn't drive the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves' new hitting coach, Don Baylor, said Klesko's  
problems weren't merely physical. He tried to pull the ball every 
time, Baylor said, rather than hitting toward the opposite field, 
all in the blind pursuit of prodigious home runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember when Klesko first came to the big leagues, he was a  
left-center guy,'' Baylor said. ``Sometimes, you forget about other 
things you have to do, like putting the ball in play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for making the transition back to first base, no one seems to  
think that will be a major challenge for Klesko, even though his 
most memorable moment at that position was a glaring error in Game 
4 of the 1996 World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Klesko entered the game at first during a 10th inning  
double-switch, only to drop a soft liner by Charlie Hayes that 
allowed an insurance run to score in New York's 8-6 victory. Klesko 
claimed he lost the ball in the lights. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll do all right over there,'' said Glenn Hubbard, the  
Braves' new infield coach. ``It's not like he won't work at it. The 
son of a gun got to be where he was pretty good in the outfield.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Klesko played seven games at first and usually took  
ground balls once or twice a week. Now, he's going to be doing it 
every day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not saying it's going to be easy, but I don't think it's  
going to be terribly hard, either,'' he said. ``Guys are going to 
be hitting scud missiles at you from 90 feet away, so you've got to 
hang in there. But that's why we've got five weeks of spring 
training.''

<HEADLINE> Ocalan Highlights Greek Policy Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Earlier this month, a sleek executive jet  
carrying Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan touched down in 
Greece -- and once again self-proclaimed Greek patriots had dragged 
their nation into an international mess. 
</P>
<P>
	The fingerprints of ultra-nationalists have been on nearly every  
Greek foreign affairs crisis in recent years -- and they have 
managed to shove their agenda to the forefront of Greek politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an inept state ... every buccaneer, every privateer can  
make a dent in policy,'' said Thanos Veremis, president of the 
Hellenic Foundation for Defense and Foreign Policy. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1990s, uncompromising northern Greeks took the lead  
in fiercely opposing the use of the name Macedonia by the former 
Yugoslav republic -- a campaign that left Greece internationally 
isolated. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, rabid anti-Turkish politicians and journalists helped  
stoke a showdown over claims to the uninhabited Greek island of 
Imia. Turkish nationalists further escalated the feud, bringing the 
NATO neighbors the closest they have ever come to war. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Ocalan debacle carries an extra sting for Greece:  
National pride was trampled by its inability to safeguard the 
Kurdish leader from its longtime rival, Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, the government never wanted the role of Ocalan's  
guardian. Greece never felt it worth the risk of a conflict with 
Turkey, where Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party has battled since 
1984 for autonomy. More than 37,000 people have died in the 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Premier Costas Simitis must explain to a humiliated nation  
how a clique of Ocalan supporters, led by a retired naval officer, 
smuggled the rebel leader into Greece and effectively blackmailed 
the government into taking him under its wing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately ... irresponsible and stupid supposed  
super-patriots here in Greece ... play for national interests, for 
foreign policy, on issues of vital interest to the country,'' 
Simitis complained last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The crew that brought Ocalan to Greece is just the latest in an  
eclectic lineage of Greeks who have meddled in issues they perceive 
as national causes. 
</P>
<P>
	They include politicians of all stripes -- conservatives and  
socialists -- as well as academics, doctors, lawyers, writers and 
some retired military officers. 
</P>
<P>
	A common theme for many is their sense of the ``lost  
homelands,'' a vision of shrinking Greek influence that in ancient 
times encompassed a wide region across the Mediterranean, North 
Africa, the Balkans and Asia Minor. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Ocalan case, many supporters view him as a modern-day  
embodiment of the Greeks who rose up against the Ottoman Turks that 
ruled Greece for 400 years until the early 19th century. 
</P>
<P>
	George Savidis, who represented AHEPA, the largest  
Greek-American organization for more than seven years, complained 
that often a ``few nuts'' can undermine years of diplomacy and 
foreign policy efforts in Greece's volatile neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	But the actors often don't see it that way.  
</P>
<P>
	The retired commodore who dumped the Ocalan issue on Greece,  
Andonis Naxakis, challenged officials who began interrogating him 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let them arrest me,'' he said. ``I did my duty.''

<HEADLINE>  Team Impressed By McGwire's Acting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUPITER, Fla. (AP) -- The reviews are in: Mark McGwire can act,  
too. 
</P>
<P>
	``He might be the next John Wayne,'' St. Louis Cardinals general  
manager Walt Jocketty said Tuesday, a day after the 70-homer man 
made his debut on the sitcom ``Mad About You.'' ``I think if he 
wanted to, he'd be pretty good at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Tony La Russa said McGwire's guest appearance was almost  
as good as one of his home runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoever coached him for that appearance, we ought to hire,''  
La Russa said. ``He was outstanding -- surprisingly. I was really 
impressed. I didn't expect him to be anywhere near that good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, not everyone was that complimentary. After all,  
McGwire played himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``He shouldn't quit his day job,'' pitching coach Dave Duncan  
joked. 
</P>
<P>
	Landing in bed on screen with Helen Hunt was one of the  
highlights of McGwire's hectic offseason. He didn't appear until 
late in the half-hour show and didn't have a lot of lines, but 
pulled off his role without a hitch in one of those 
mistaken-identity, wrong-room routines. 
</P>
<P>
	His best line came at the end, when he and Hunt were at the  
breakfast table on the morning after. Paul Reiser walked in wearing 
a Cardinals uniform, continuing the role reversal theme. 
</P>
<P>
	``You remember, they're going to throwing you junk all year  
long,'' McGwire said. ``So just wait for your pitch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then he gave Hunt a quick kiss. Leaving character and returning  
to McGwire the baseball player, he raised an arm in triumph as if 
he'd just taken someone deep. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be tough to be an actor all the time,''  
pitcher Alan Benes said. ``He was probably more nervous doing that 
than anytime in his life. That's probably a lot harder than facing 
a pitcher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's only misstep Monday came when he missed a team party  
and screening at a local restaurant. McGwire apparently forgot 
about the back entrance the Cardinals had waiting for him and tried 
to go in the front door. When he saw TV cameras and fans waiting, 
he turned around. 
</P>
<P>
	``The notoriety he's gained, people want a piece of him,''  
Jocketty said. ``You'd be surprised at the unbelievable requests we 
get, from media and fans. They don't understand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals are taking steps to protect McGwire as much as  
possible. Though he showed up at camp Monday -- two days ahead of 
schedule -- he's not speakers with reporters until after full-squad 
workouts start Wednesday. His interview time throughout spring and 
the season will be regulated. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll make time to talk the first few days,'' La Russa said.  
``There are certain things he doesn't want to talk about after that 
point, like `How'd it feel to hit 70?' If somebody tries to push 
him on it, they're not going to be very happy, because he's just 
not going to talk about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire took some batting practice in an indoor cage Monday. On  
Tuesday he muscled up outside with 11 home runs in two BP turns, 
signed several autographs and then called it a day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did you expect differently?'' pitcher Matt Morris said.  
``Eleven homers, that's weak for him, isn't it?''

<HEADLINE> Arsenal Wins Replayed Soccer Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Ten days later, Arsenal beat Sheffield United --  
again. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gunners, who agreed to a replay even though they won the  
original game, won 2-1 Tuesday night on goals by Marc Overmars and 
Dennis Bergkamp, advancing to the quarterfinals of England's 
Football Association Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	United had protested that Overmars' go-ahead goal in the  
original game was unfair because Gunners' forward Nwankwo Kanu 
ignored or misunderstood a well-established procedure that follows 
when a player gets injured while the ball is in play. 
</P>
<P>
	With one of its players lying injured, United kicked the ball  
out of play so he could get treatment and expected Arsenal to throw 
the ball back in to one of the Blades' players. Instead, Kanu 
chased after the ball and crossed to Overmars, who scored. 
</P>
<P>
	Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger then called for the the game to be  
replayed. FIFA, soccer's governing body, did not grant approval 
until Monday, just 24 hours before the scheduled kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
	At Highbury, Overmars scored in the 15th minute of the replay  
and Bergkamp scored with eight minutes left in the first half. 
Arsenal plays Derby County of Huddersfield in the quarterfinals.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals' La Russa Accused of Bias </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUPITER, Fla. (AP) -- Three months after the St. Louis Cardinals  
traded Ron Gant, he and former manager Tony La Russa are still 
exchanging insults. 
</P>
<P>
	Immediately after he was dealt to the Philadelphia Phillies,  
Gant popped off about Mark McGwire batting third instead of fourth. 
On Tuesday, Gant even accused La Russa of racism. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rickey Henderson didn't like him, Royce Clayton didn't like  
him,'' Gant told reporters in Clearwater, Fla. ``He treated Ozzie 
Smith like dirt. Brian Jordan didn't like him. I don't know too 
many people who did like him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All of those players are black.  
</P>
<P>
	``You do the math,'' Gant said. ``Something's not right there.''  
</P>
<P>
	La Russa did a slow burn when the comments were relayed to him.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's called unforgivable,'' La Russa said. ``That's lower  
than cheap. But I'm not going to sue him. I'll turn the page.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among Gant's accusations are that La Russa hastened the  
retirement of Smith, a future Hall of Famer, by having him split 
time with Royce Clayton in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anyone who treats Ozzie Smith like he's some kid coming up  
from the minors has no ethics or morals to him,'' Gant said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gant also said having McGwire bat third and the pitcher hit  
eighth hurt everyone else in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Cardinals were the laughingstock of the league for that  
lineup,'' Gant said. ``Guys on every team were coming up to me and 
saying `What's this about?' All I could say is `Nobody knows what 
he's thinking about.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa responded that Ray Lankford batted .293 with 31 homers  
and 105 RBIs, Brian Jordan hit .316 with 25 homers and 91 RBIs and 
Delino DeShields was effective as the leadoff man with a .290 
average and 26 steals. 
</P>
<P>
	``And in his few games in September, it worked for J.D. Drew,''  
La Russa said. ``The only one it didn't work for was Ron Gant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa also fired back about Gant's lack of production. Gant  
struck out 162 times in 1997 and slumped again last season, needing 
a strong September to win up at .240 with 26 homers and 67 RBIs. In 
382 games with the Cardinals during three seasons, he fanned 352 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was whiff, whiff, whiff,'' La Russa said. ``I really hope  
he goes to Philly and whiffs for them like he whiffed for us, and 
we'll see what excuse he makes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gant said those who conclude La Russa is a good manager have the  
wrong impression. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who are those people?'' he said. ``Are they from another  
planet? He was successful in Oakland because he had four or five 
50-homer guys. You could manage them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gant said La Russa prefers to surround himself with players who  
won't question his authority. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he can't control you as a player, if you're not a `yes'  
player, he doesn't want you,'' Gant said. ``If you have your own 
opinions, he doesn't want you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa wondered what else Gant accused him of.  
</P>
<P>
	``Did he say anything about me kicking animals or robbing old  
ladies?'' the manager said. 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa also said he'd like to talk to Gant and end it.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just want somebody to give me his phone number so I can call  
him,'' he said. ``I hope he'll answer the phone.''

<HEADLINE> Lettuce Co. Settles Harassment Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- One of the nation's largest lettuce  
growers has agreed to pay $1.9 million to settle allegations that 
managers demanded sexual favors from female Hispanic farm workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission announced the  
settlement Tuesday, saying it was the largest sexual harassment 
settlement it has ever handled in the agriculture industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case steps forward to protect the rights of those who are  
probably the most vulnerable in our country: Latina farm workers,'' 
said EEOC chairwoman Ida Castro. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, Tanimura &AMP; Antle of Salinas, admitted no  
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	According to court records, Blanca Alfaro was told by a  
production manager and another manager that she had to perform 
sexual favors to keep her job and get her benefits. In addition, 
the records alleged that a male employee was threatened when he 
tried to report the harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfaro will receive an undisclosed amount of the settlement and  
four years' salary, including two years' back pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Other details of the alleged harassment were kept confidential.  
</P>
<P>
	Three employees were disciplined in the case, according to the  
EEOC. Two workers are no longer employed at the company and cannot 
be rehired. A third employee received a written reprimand and will 
undergo counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	The EEOC said it believed there are a few more employees who  
were also sexually harassed.

<P>
	Today is Wednesday, Feb. 24, the 55nd day of 1999. There are 310  
days left in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's Highlight in History:  
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 24, 1868, the House of Representatives impeached  
President Andrew Johnson following his attempted dismissal of 
Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton; Johnson was later acquitted by 
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	On this date:  
</P>
<P>
	In 1803, the Supreme Court ruled itself the final interpreter of  
constitutional issues. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1821, Mexico declared its independence from Spain.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1863, Arizona was organized as a territory.

time. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1945, American soldiers liberated the Philippine capital of  
Manila from Japanese control. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1955, the Cole Porter musical ``Silk Stockings'' opened at  
the Imperial Theater on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1980, the U.S. hockey team defeated Finland, 4-2, to clinch

</P>
<P>
	In 1981, Buckingham Palace announced the engagement of Britain's  
Prince Charles to Lady Diana Spencer. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1983, a congressional commission released a report condemning  
the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II as a 
``grave injustice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, in a ruling that expanded legal protections for parody  
and satire, the Supreme Court overturned a $200,000 award that Rev. 
Jerry Falwell had won against Hustler magazine and publisher Larry 
Flynt. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago: A state funeral was held in Japan for Emperor  
Hirohito, who died the month before at age 87. A cargo door blew 
off a United Air Lines Boeing 747-100 flying near Hawaii; the 
explosive release of pressure pulled nine passengers to their 
deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago: Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders labeled smoking  
an ``adolescent addiction'' and accused the tobacco industry of 
trying to convince teen-agers that cigarettes will make them sexy 
and successful. Entertainer Dinah Shore died in Beverly Hills, 
Calif., at age 76. 
</P>
<P>
	One year ago: Henny Youngman, a tireless comic who quipped  
``Take my wife -- please'' and countless other one-liners during a 
career that spanned seven decades, died in New York City at age 91.

<HEADLINE> Hundreds Attend Siskel Funeral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HIGHLAND PARK, Ill. (AP) -- Film critic Gene Siskel was  
remembered as a public man who loved his private life. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,200 people attended his funeral Monday, including  
Oprah Winfrey, Christie Hefner and Siskel's longtime television 
partner, Roger Ebert. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Richard M. Daley canceled scheduled campaign stops to  
attend the service at a Jewish synagogue on the wooded shore of 
Lake Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	``He breathed and slept Chicago and his love of our sports, love  
of politics,'' Daley said. ``And of course, always his review of 
films was a highlight for myself and, I think, not only for 
Chicagoans, but for people who truly loved the arts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Siskel died Saturday at 53 from complications following surgery  
to remove a growth from his brain in May. 
</P>
<P>
	In a eulogy, Rabbi Vernon Kurtz spoke of Siskel's dedication to  
his family and his faith. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the same manner that you have used these many years -- Gene  
Siskel, you lived a life that was indeed two thumbs up,'' Kurtz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rabbi spoke of how Siskel's last appearance outside his home  
or the hospital was at his daughter's bat mitzvah in January, and 
how he smiled in spite of his obvious pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Siskel told his daughter the most important things in life were  
family and Judaism, Kurtz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Siskel is survived by his wife, Marlene, two teen-age daughters  
and a 4-year-old son.

<HEADLINE> Philadelphians Want Ricky Williams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams said  
Tuesday night that he wants to play in a city that wants him. 
Philadelphia ought to fit that requirement quite nicely. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Edward G. Rendell said interest in Williams has eclipsed  
all other issues on the minds of the citizens he meets. He said 
people no longer ask him about tax cuts, the upcoming election, or 
other issues mayors usually face. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only question I've gotten from the people of the city of  
Philadelphia for the last six weeks is, `Are we going to draft 
Ricky Williams?''' Rendell said during Tuesday night's banquet held 
by the Maxwell Football Club. 
</P>
<P>
	That went along with what Williams said just minutes earlier.  
</P>
<P>
	``I want to go somewhere where they're excited to have me,''  
Williams said as he spoke briefly to reporters after signing 
autographs for children before stepping into the banquet hall. 
</P>
<P>
	So how does Philadelphia's reaction compare to the reaction  
elsewhere? 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said he doesn't know. He hasn't been to similar events  
in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA record-breaking running back from Texas could return to  
Philadelphia in the near future, since the Eagles hold the No. 2 
pick in the upcoming NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just wants to play football,'' said Sandy Williams, the  
player's mother, accepting the Maxwell Award for college player of 
the year on his behalf. ``Ricky can adapt to any situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday, Randall Cunningham spoke as the club honored  
him as pro football player of the year, giving him the Bert Bell 
Award for the third time. He led the Minnesota Vikings to a 15-1 
regular season while throwing 34 touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past I didn't really appreciate when I received an  
award,'' Cunningham said during a midday press conference. ``I was 
young and immature and took it for granted. But this is a great 
honor. I've grown and now have the maturity to accept it and know 
what it's all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham, 35, who previously won the Bert Bell in 1988 and  
1990, joined Baltimore Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas as the only 
three-time winners of the award. He said returning to Philadelphia, 
where he spent his first 11 seasons, made it special. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other award winners cited by the Maxwell Club were  
Texas A&AMP;M linebacker Dat Nguyen, who won the Chuck Bednarik Award 
as defensive player of the year; Tennessee's Phil Fullmer, who 
guided the Vols to a perfect season and the national championship 
and was named George Munger college coach of the year; and Dennis 
Green, named Greasy Neale professional coach of the year after 
leading Cunningham and the Vikings to the NFL's best record. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Lycoming coach Frank Girardi became the Maxwell's  
first tri-state college coach of the year winner, Justin Sands of 
the Hill School received the Jim Henry high school student athlete 
honors, and Pittsburgh Steelers president Dan Rooney was named Reds 
Bagnell winner for contributions to football.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls Against Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against the Japanese yen Tuesday  
in a further retreat from an 11-week high, but it gained ground 
against the euro and the British pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan  
Greenspan captivated currency traders. With Greenspan signaling 
that change was unlikely soon in monetary policy, U.S. Treasury 
bond prices fell as hopes dimmed for an interest rate cut and 
stocks turned in a mixed performance. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro -- the single currency of 11  
European nations -- was quoted at $1.1007, down from $1.1028 late 
Monday. The British pound fell to $1.6134 from $1.6258. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in late trading, the dollar was quoted at 120.81 Japanese  
yen, down from 120.91 Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, before beginning to decline, the dollar had topped  
122 yen for the first time in 11 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders in Japan said the dollar lost ground Tuesday after  
Eisuke Sakakibara, a top finance ministry official, was quoted in 
the business daily Nihon Keizai as predicting that the yen will 
strengthen if the economy recovers this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sakakibara's comments gave us the impression that Japanese  
monetary authorities don't want excessive weakness of the yen,'' 
said Koichi Kubo, assistant general manager of foreign exchange at 
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	In later trading, currency dealers closely followed Greenspan's  
testimony as he appeared before the Senate Banking Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, in his semiannual report to Congress, said the U.S.  
economy should remain strong. But he cautioned that there were 
risks, including a stock market drop or a rebound in inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Some interpreted his remarks to mean there would be no interest  
rate moves in the next few months, either up or down. But Greenspan 
left open the possibility of rate cuts or increases down the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did a typical double speak: On the one hand the Fed might  
ease, the Fed might tighten,'' said Sherry Cooper, chief economist 
and senior vice president for Nesbitt Burns Inc., a Toronto-based 
investment company subsidiary of the Bank of Montreal. ``As a 
result, the (stock) market sold off and the dollar sold off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the dollar regained its strength against the euro partly  
because a German government aide was quoted as saying that if the 
European Union couldn't agree on a budget, financial markets might 
perceive that as euro-zone fiscal failure. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Germany's finance minister again called on the European  
Central Bank to cut rates, a move that would undermine the euro by 
driving away investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4477 Swiss francs, down from  
1.4495, and 1.4961 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4962. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Tuesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.7768 German 
marks, up from 1.7734; 5.9595 French francs, up from 5.9488; and 
1,760.56 Italian lire, up from 1,754.39.

<HEADLINE> Survivor of 1911 Fire Dies at 107 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Bessie Cohen, a survivor of the 1911 Triangle  
Shirtwaist fire in New York that led to passage of some of 
America's first worker safety laws, has died at 107. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Cohen, who died Sunday, became an icon to union activists  
seeking to eliminate dangerous working conditions in sweatshops. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire she survived as a 19-year-old Russian immigrant took  
the lives of 146 of her co-workers, mostly other young immigrant 
women. But the tragedy gave momentum to America's young labor 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``By surviving what she had been through, she became a symbol  
for the labor movement and also for the Jewish community in 
America,'' said Steve Nutter, regional director for the Union of 
Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Her name was Bessie Gabrilowich on March 25, 1911. The garment  
workers were just finishing a nine-hour shift at the Triangle 
Shirtwaist Co. factory when a co-worker told her the building was 
on fire. 
</P>
<P>
	She ran past a group of women crying and pounding on the doors  
of an elevator shaft. The main stairway was locked, but Mrs. Cohen 
escaped by running down stairs near the freight elevator. 
</P>
<P>
	After reaching the safety of the street, Mrs. Cohen watched  
co-workers leap from the upper floors of the 10-story building. 
Among them was her 15-year-old friend, Dora Wolfovitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody was running, trying to get out,'' Mrs. Cohen said in  
a 1996 interview with the Los Angeles Times. ``And there was this 
beautiful little girl, my friend, Dora. I remember her face before 
she jumped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A photograph that appeared in The New York Times the day after  
the fire shows Mrs. Cohen swooning at the sight of dozens of bodies 
laid out at a makeshift morgue. 
</P>
<P>
	The blaze led to passage of improved fire safety and worker  
protection laws in New York and other states. Some of those laws 
eventually became models for national legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the fire was never determined, but a commission  
appointed to investigate found that a number of exit doors had been 
locked. Also, survivors said water hoses in the building didn't 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one survivor of the fire is still living. Rose  
Freedman, 103, of Beverly Hills, escaped from the burning factory 
by fleeing to the roof, said her daughter, Arlene March. Mrs. 
Freedman was 18 at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	After the fire, Mrs. Cohen went on to work in a grocery store.  
She married in 1916 and in 1941 moved to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mrs. Cohen's a symbol because she reminds us of our past and  
we look and see it's not just the past. It's right here today,'' 
Nutter said.

<HEADLINE> Hornets' Armstrong Out Two Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Charlotte Hornets reserve guard B.J.  
Armstrong will be sidelined for at least two weeks because of a 
degenerative condition in his right knee, the injury-depleted team 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, 31, had been complaining of soreness in the knee for  
several days, and a magnetic resonance imaging test Tuesday 
disclosed the condition, said Dr. Glenn Perry, the team's doctor. 
Armstrong, who has averaged 5.8 points and 2.7 assists this season, 
will try rest and therapy for two weeks, at which time additional 
tests will determine the next course of action. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, the Hornets said reserve guard Eldridge Recasner  
was doubtful for Wednesday night's home game against Miami because 
of a hyperextended right elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Armstrong nor Recasner can be placed on the injured list  
because Charlotte (1-7) already has three players on it, including 
starting forwards Glen Rice and Anthony Mason.

<HEADLINE> Columbia/HCA Reports Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Columbia/HCA Healthcare's fourth quarter  
earnings fell far short of Wall Street expectations today, as the 
nation's largest hospital company was pummeled by declining 
admissions, falling Medicare reimbursement and rising medical 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income from continuing operations, excluding gains on the  
sale of 72 hospitals and surgery centers, costs related to the 
investigation and other expenses, was $27 million, or 4 cents per 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	That was an improvement from a year ago when Nashville-based  
Columbia lost $404 million or 63 cents per share, from continuing 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts had expected earnings from operations of 23 cents  
per share, according to survey by First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the unexpectedly low earnings, the company's shares were  
up 56 1/4 cents at $18.93 3/4 at midday on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said Columbia may be edging closer to a settlement with  
the government over a billing fraud investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	They noted Columbia said Tuesday it has recently issued a $1  
billion letter of credit to the Justice Department related to its 
recently completed $1 billion share repurchase program. The letter 
of credit was issued in conjunction with a new $1 billion stock 
buyback program. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia said the $1 billion figure was not related to how big a  
fine it might pay as part of any settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	For the latest quarter, its loss including onetime items was $42  
million, or 6 cents a share, in contrast to a loss of $1.2 billion, 
or $1.92 per share, in 1997. The 1997 loss was due mainly to huge 
write-offs related to the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth-quarter revenue was up slightly, from $4.37 billion to  
$4.42 billion. But same-facility admissions, a key measure of the 
company's vitality, were off 1 percent. In December alone, 
admissions dropped by 3.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the company soon resolves the fraud investigation, its  
overall operations appear in poor shape, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hospitals are a volume driven business,'' said Sheryl  
Skolnick, an analyst with BancBoston/Robertson Stephens. ``If you 
do not have patients in the beds, this is clearly the margin 
pressure you would expect to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For more than 18 months, the federal government and at least 11  
states have been looking into whether Columbia committed fraud by 
overcharging Medicare, Medicaid and other government health 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Four Columbia middle managers were indicted in Florida. They are  
charged with conspiring to defraud the government of $2.8 million 
by disguising certain Medicare claims to get a higher 
reimbursement. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia has stopped gobbling up hospitals and has been selling  
off assets. It hopes to complete the previously announced tax-free 
spin-offs of 61 hospitals during the second quarter, but needs 
approval from the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Columbia reported a profit of $379 million, or 59  
cents per share, compared with a loss of $305 million or 46 cents 
per share for 1997. Revenue was down slightly, from $18.8 billion 
to $18.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the earnings boost came from the $365 million Columbia  
earned last year from the sale of 36 hospitals, 36 surgery centers 
and other assets, part of a plan to jettison about a third of its 
hospitals and consolidate operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia sold 14 hospitals during the fourth quarter, leaving it  
with 305 hospitals nationwide, down from 336 a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Woods Ready First Match Play Event  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- With the flash of a smile, Tiger Woods  
spoke volumes about his anticipation of seeing Nick Faldo on the 
first tee and anyone else who may follow over the next few days of 
the Match Play Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	With one swing of the club, he showed why the smile isn't for  
show. 
</P>
<P>
	``Give me the driver,'' he said to Bryon Bell, a childhood  
friend who is caddying for him this week. ``I've got a bet to 
settle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His eyes locked on a white truck beyond the 40-foot mesh net at  
the back end of the driving range, Woods swung with all his might 
and watched the ball arc majestically into the blue skies north of 
San Diego and disappear over the fence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Give me another one,'' he said. This one sailed so far that no  
one was exactly sure where it landed -- if it ever did. Woods let 
out an approving laugh, put his money in his pocket and walked off 
to the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Chalk another up for Tiger, and let the matches begin.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have always enjoyed playing one-on-one,'' Woods said. ``I  
have always enjoyed having a chance when a tournament comes down to 
a one-on-one situation. I love the feeling of that. In this sport, 
we don't get that chance very often.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's about to change.  
</P>
<P>
	The Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship, which begins  
Wednesday with the top 64 players in the world, brings match play 
back as an official event for the first time since the two-year 
Tucson experiment ended in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Only this will never be confused for Tucson or any other regular  
stop on any of the five tours behind the $5 million World Golf 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of excitement in the air, a lot of buzz,'' said  
Mark O'Meara. ``These world events are definitely important, 
because you always want to play against the best players, and you 
definitely have them here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only one missing is Jumbo Ozaki, who is 52 and rarely leaves  
Japan. No one seems to be complaining, because his absence let in 
Nick Faldo and set the table for high drama on the first day of the 
matches. 
</P>
<P>
	Faldo vs. Woods.  
</P>
<P>
	``Knowing that you have got to go head-to-head with Nick Faldo  
... that gets me pretty fired up,'' Woods said. ``Doesn't matter 
what golf course I'm playing. I'll be excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods hasn't looked this relaxed, hasn't smiled this wide since  
Saturday afternoon at Augusta National two years ago when he was 
well on his way to a record, runaway victory in the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	La Costa doesn't give Woods the advantage he gets at Augusta,  
but it doesn't hurt. With dry weather expected all week, and rough 
nowhere near the level of a U.S. Open, length will again be like 
having an extra club in the bag. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't particularly need to hit it straight,'' said Lee  
Westwood of England. ``You just need to hit the ball a long way. 
They will play into a couple people's hands, not that I'm 
mentioning any names.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't have to.  
</P>
<P>
	Woods is considered one of the best in America at match play,  
particularly since he won the U.S. Amateur three years in a row. He 
also beat Greg Norman 1-up in a meaningless singles match in the 
Presidents Cup in December. 
</P>
<P>
	And the past month has offered even more evidence why Woods has  
been gearing up for the Match Play Championship. He has played the 
past four weeks and showed that he's not quite ready to yield his 
No. 1 ranking to David Duval. 
</P>
<P>
	He tied for third in Phoenix behind Rocco Mediate, won in San  
Diego in a match-play atmosphere against Billy Ray Brown, then had 
a brief lead in the Nissan Open last week before finishing second, 
two strokes behind Ernie Els. 
</P>
<P>
	``I play with Tiger, and he's swing pretty darn good,'' O'Meara  
said. ``He's putting well, and has done so in the last couple of 
weeks. He's a good match-play player. He's going to do very well 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The brackets are set up like an NCAA tournament, but the  
expectations for the top seeds to sail toward the Final Four are 
hardly the same. The difference between No. 6 (Colin Montgomerie) 
and No. 59 (Craig Stadler) is nothing like the difference between 
Kentucky and Alcorn State. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how you can call it an upset, because the guys in  
the top 64 are all good players,'' O'Meara said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the strength of the field, despite the money, none of  
the players are willing to put the Match Play in the same league 
with any of the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not to say they are any less excited.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to be huge,'' said Nick Price. ``It's  
dog-eat-dog, every day. You've got to play your best from the first 
hole to the last if you want to get all the way through. Whoever 
wins this week will have five great scalps under their belt.''

<HEADLINE> Airborne Express Faces FAA Fines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Airborne Express and three companies the air  
cargo carrier uses to handle hazardous materials face $210,000 in 
fines for allegedly failing to train their employees properly. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration announced Tuesday that it  
has proposed a $100,000 civil penalty against ABX Air Inc., a 
wholly owned subsidiary of Airborne, for allegedly failing to train 
four cargo handlers and a supervisor on the identification and 
proper handling of hazardous materials. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the allegations, Airborne Express spokeswoman  
Camille Pitre said, ``We are now just investigating to determine 
specifically what it all entails, if there are some issues that 
have to be worked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agency proposed a second fine of $80,000 for Airborne  
Express contractor Hilson &AMP; Fergusson Inc. of Fernandina Beach, 
Fla., alleging that it failed to train and test its hazardous 
material employees and to keep appropriate training records. 
</P>
<P>
	It directly employed the cargo loaders who worked at an Airborne  
Express facility in Nashville, Tenn., and the FAA says a follow-up 
inspection found that Hilson &AMP; Fergusson had another untrained 
Airborne Express contract employee whose responsibilities included 
loading hazardous materials onto Airborne Express aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	A third fine of $20,000 is proposed for contractor Canuck  
Industries Inc. of Bellingham, Wash. The FAA alleges that two 
employees who worked as drivers for Airborne Express did not have 
hazardous materials training. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency proposed a fourth fine of $10,000 for contractor  
Motor Air Dispatch of Murfreesboro, Tenn., alleging that it also 
failed to provide one of its employees, a driver for Airborne 
Express, with hazardous materials training. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA filed the notices Jan. 29. The companies have 30 days  
from receipt of the notice to reply.

<HEADLINE> Lucinda Williams Favored in NY Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lucinda Williams' trip down the back roads of  
the South took her to the top of the Village Voice music critics 
poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Her ``Car Wheels on a Gravel Road'' was named best album of 1998  
in the weekly's annual poll, narrowly beating Grammy favorite 
Lauryn Hill's solo debut, ``The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' sweet blend of country, rock, folk and blues is  
something of a travelogue of the Southern towns she knows as an 
on-the-road singer-songwriter and daughter of a college professor. 
</P>
<P>
	The critics also liked Bob Dylan's live recording from 1966, a  
collaboration between Billy Bragg and Wilco on some just-discovered 
Woody Guthrie songs and Elliott Smith's ``XO'' album. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll involved 496 critics.

<HEADLINE> Bowater To Cut Print Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- Bowater Inc. says it will cut newsprint  
production at a Canadian mill by 35,000 metric tons this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowater, North America's largest newsprint producer, said  
Tuesday the cutback would correct an order imbalance at its mill in 
Gatineau, Quebec. The mill has a capacity of 450,000 metric tons a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sagging paper and pulp prices hurt the Greenville-based company  
this past year as it posted an $18.5 million loss, partly because 
of charges related to the planned sale of mill in Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowater has 10 pulp and paper mills in the United States, Canada  
and Korea.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Olympic Village Raided </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The Olympic Village and five other  
Sydney building sites have been raided by Australian Federal Police 
and Australian Tax Office investigators over an alleged $5.2 
million tax fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Simultaneous raids Tuesday morning by 40 officers followed an  
investigation of 30 companies controlled by one person, the Daily 
Telegraph in Sydney reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said police arrested two people associated with  
construction work on the Olympic Village and froze bank accounts 
and assets in the wake of a six-month investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Fyna Formwork director James Soong was charged with organized  
fraud under the Proceeds of Crime Act, after officers stopped him 
in his car near his western Sydney home. 
</P>
<P>
	Soong and a Fyna Formwork accountant were also facing three  
criminal charges each of defrauding the commonwealth for not paying 
tax, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Olympic Coordination Authority refused to comment on the  
future of Fyna's contract work at the Olympic Village.

<HEADLINE> MLB Spring Training Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Houston Astros knew Moises Alou would be absent for the  
start of spring training. Now, the NL Central champions might be 
missing him for the whole season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros learned Monday that their All-Star outfielder, who  
fell off a treadmill last week, has a torn anterior cruciate 
ligament in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a devastating blow for our team,'' Astros general  
manager Gerry Hunsicker said from training camp in Kissimmee, Fla. 
``Clearly, this was the worst-case scenario we could have 
imagined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's probably facing missing most of the year, possibly the  
whole season,'' Hunsicker said. ``I think the best we could hope 
for is that he returns sometime in late August or early 
September.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alou, 32, hit .312 with 38 home runs and 124 RBIs. Carl Everett  
and young Richard Hidalgo will try to take Alou's place in left 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	Alou was hurt last Thursday at his home in the Dominican  
Republic when he lost his balance trying to adjust a treadmill that 
was going too fast. He hoped the injury was not serious, but an MRI 
in Houston showed the damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Anaheim Angels and Texas Rangers also were struck by  
injuries, though nothing as serious as the one to Alou. And Florida 
rookie Mike Lowell was recovering after undergoing surgery for 
testicular cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Angels shortstop Gary DiSarcina will miss at least a month after  
breaking his left forearm in a freak accident at camp in Tempe, 
Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	DiSarcina, a sound fielder who batted .287 last season, was hurt  
Sunday. After taking batting-practice swings, he blindly turned and 
walked into the swing of first-base coach George Hendrick, who was 
hitting ground balls to infielders. 
</P>
<P>
	DiSarcina was confident he would be back before the Angels'  
opener April 6. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be around all the time, running a lot, because I want to  
be with the guys,'' he said. ``This is not going to ruin our frame 
of mind entering the season. I'm determined to make sure of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas will be minus closer John Wetteland for the next week or  
two after he strained his right ankle during a workout at Port 
Charlotte, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's frustrating because I put in a lot of sweat and hard work  
to get back to where I was feeling pretty good,'' Wetteland said. 
``It just shows that the ankle is an important part of the body, 
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wetteland, who had 42 saves and was 3-1 with a 2.03 ERA, had  
elbow surgery in the offseason and has been throwing without any 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell, a third baseman acquired from the New York Yankees on  
Feb. 1, had a testicle removed Sunday in an outpatient surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prognosis for recovery is excellent,'' general manager  
Dave Dombrowski said. ``It is not a life-threatening situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell was expected to be the Marlins' starting third baseman.  
He is scheduled to begin workouts with other position players 
Friday at Melbourne, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the players showing up in camps Monday were Mark McGwire,  
Albert Belle and David Wells. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire took batting practice, worked out in the weight room and  
played table tennis in the St. Louis Cardinals' clubhouse in 
Jupiter, Fla. The 70-homer man will hold a news conference 
Wednesday after the team's first full squad workout. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope the people in St. Louis, and here, will give him some  
space, let him go to a restaurant, go to the mall,'' Cardinals 
manager Tony La Russa said. ``I'm betting on the people in St. 
Louis. He's their guy. I can't imagine anyone would do anything to 
hurt him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire was expected to join in a team party Monday night at a  
local restaurant to watch an episode of the TV show ``Mad About 
You.'' McGwire played himself in the episode. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle, meanwhile, took his first swings for the Baltimore  
Orioles in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would rather have come to Baltimore than the Yankees,'' said  
Belle, who worked out two days early. ``You look at their 
situation, they're the kingpin and you want to be that underdog 
that knocks them off the top. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's pretty much the situation I've been in my whole career.  
It just makes for a better season when you knock the big guys off 
the top,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells reported to camp at Dunedin, Fla., and offered an  
immediate assessment of the trade that sent him to the Blue Jays 
and moved Roger Clemens to the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Toronto got the better part of the deal,'' Wells said.  
``The key to winning is pitching and this team has some good 
pitchers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto general manager Gord Ash, who got the big lefty,  
reliever Graeme Lloyd and second baseman Homer Bush for Clemens 
last week, said he intends to keep Wells. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not discuss any deals with David Wells,'' Ash said.  
``In the words of George Bush: Read my lips -- David Wells will not 
be traded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Mets and Cleveland supposedly are interested in  
Wells, who went 18-4 during the regular season and 4-0 in the 
postseason for the World Series champions.

<HEADLINE> NBC Retains Lead in Sweeps Week / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- George Clooney wasn't the only big draw on  
television last week, though he was enough to give NBC a big 
ratings boost during the key ``sweeps'' period. 
</P>
<P>
	Clooney's last regular appearance on ``ER'' as Dr. Doug Ross was  
only one example of the ``sweeps'' shows that profited from a 
ballooning number of viewers last week, Nielsen Media Research said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Viewership last Thursday jumped 30 percent, thanks to ``ER'' and  
other programs, including the final chapter of Stephen King's ABC 
miniseries ``Storm of the Century'' and the Fox reality special 
``World's Most Shocking Medical Videos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In a sea of network erosion, if you put the right programs on  
people will tune in to the networks. Thursday was a clear example 
of that,'' said industry analyst Mark Berman of New York-based 
Seltel. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's top-rated ``ER'' had the biggest audience for an episode  
of any regular entertainment series this season, with viewership 15 
percent higher than normal for the series. 
</P>
<P>
	The third and final part of the King miniseries ranked 11th for  
the week; the Fox special was 30th. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC won the week of Feb. 15-21 with a 9.9 rating and 16 share,  
keeping the network ahead during the February sweeps, when ratings 
are used to set local advertising rates. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS was second with a 9.5 rating and 15 share, followed by ABC  
with a 9.2 rating and 15 share. Fox earned a 6.8 rating and 11 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the emerging networks, WB had a 3.7 rating and 6 share,  
UPN had a 2.3 rating and 4 share and PAX TV had a 0.7 rating and 1 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. Share is the 
percentage of televisions in use that are tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	Other shows enjoying a sweeps dividend included a two-hour  
episode of ``Star Trek: Voyager,'' with its highest rating since 
October 1997. It was UPN's highest-rated program of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Homicide'' received its best rating since November 1997  
with the conclusion of a crossover episode with ``Law &AMP; Order'' 
that jabbed at a Kenneth Starr-like special prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Queen Knights Actor Nigel Hawthorne </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Nigel Hawthorne had a little flashback to his  
television stardom when he was knighted Tuesday by Queen Elizabeth 
II. 
</P>
<P>
	``The gentlemen in front and behind me were senior civil  
servants, so I was in good company,'' said Hawthorne, who played 
the imperious civil servant Sir Humphrey Appleby on the shows 
``Yes, Minister'' and ``Yes, Prime Minister.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But I played King George III -- and I didn't get crowned  
today,'' Hawthorne joked. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawthorne, 70, said the ceremony at Buckingham Palace was less  
intimidating than an Academy Award night. Hawthorne was nominated 
for ``The Madness of King George'' but lost at the 1995 ceremony to 
Tom Hanks, who won for ``Forrest Gump.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Academy Awards are very disconcerting because you are in  
competition, whereas here you feel that you are among friends and 
you know you've already got the award,'' Hawthorne said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Six people have been sentenced for their  
part in a $17 million heist from a vault at the Loomis, Fargo 
armored car company, one of the largest thefts of its kind in U.S. 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	More than $2 million is still missing.  
</P>
<P>
	Eric Grant, one of the plotters of the heist, was sentenced  
Tuesday to 12 years and nine months. He was ordered to pay $26,000 
in restitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael McKinney was sentenced to 11 years and three months in  
prison and ordered to pay $120,000 in restitution. He was accused 
of money laundering and participating in a plot to kill David 
Ghantt. 
</P>
<P>
	Ghantt is a former Loomis employee who was videotaped stealing  
money and is awaiting sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Payne, described by prosecutors as one of the heist's ``big  
six,'' drew 6 1/2 years in prison for money laundering and larceny and

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- The European Union and members of  
the South American trade bloc known as Mercosur may join forces to 
create a gigantic, trans-Atlantic free zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations for the super-bloc are to begin in June, during a  
Latin American and EU summit in Rio, officials from both blocs 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The union would be the world's biggest free trade area, larger  
than the U.S.-proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas. 
</P>
<P>
	The hemispheric trade project has stalled since the U.S.  
Congress denied President Clinton fast-track authority to negotiate 
with Latin American countries. Meantime, Mercosur has grown bigger, 
incorporating Chile and Bolivia as associate members. 
</P>
<P>
	The move for the creation of a transatlantic free trade bloc was  
the main achievement of a EU-Mercosul Business Forum that ended 
Tuesday. About 150 business executives and government officials 
attended the meeting.

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A former presidential candidate said  
Tuesday that Colombia's second largest rebel group seems open to 
reaching a peace agreement.

<P>
	``I found very good will, the position of the National  
Liberation Army gave me a very good impression,'' Horacio Serpa 
told reporters. 
</P>

	The Liberal Party leader, who lost last year's presidential race  
to Andres Pastrana, said he met Monday with the No. 2 leader of the 
rebel group, Antonio Garcia, in a Venezuelan city he declined to 
identify. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of the group met twice in Venezuela earlier this month  
with the government's presidential peace envoy, Victor Ricardo. No 
agreements were reached.

	One-time heir apparent Ramon Ortega and Buenos Aires provincial  
governor Eduardo Duhalde announced Monday they would run together. 
They have not decided who will run for president and who for vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance of Ortega and Duhalde is seen as an effort to

<HEADLINE> Chilean Olympic Chief Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Sergio Santander, implicated in the  
widespread an Olympic bribery scandal, resigned Tuesday as 
president of Chile's Olympic committee. He had announced earlier he 
would resign March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the Chilean Olympic Committee, Santander appeared  
to bow to public pressure, disclosing he was giving up the post 
effective ``immediately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter came hours after a similar letter Monday evening in  
which had said he would depart in March, saying he needed time to 
gather his belongings and wrap up ``administrative matters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In neither letter did he indicate whether he would relinquish  
his membership on the International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, members of the Chilean committee asked Santander to  
voluntarily resign following his implication in the corruption 
scandal and an IOC recommendation for his expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	That request, Santander insisted Tuesday, ``damages any defense  
before the IOC, regardless of how valid my cause might be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His statement appeared to suggest that he still plans to attempt  
a defense during an IOC meeting in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Luis Moreno, acting president of Chile's committee, said Tuesday  
that Santander may choose to quit his IOC post rather than risk 
expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that should Santander decide to defend himself, ``it is  
clear that his position would have less force now that he is no 
longer the president of the Chilean committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Santander cited medical reasons for his resignation rather than  
involvement in the scandal. He spent several days in a hospital 
earlier this month, reportedly suffering from depression. 
</P>
<P>
	Santander has acknowledged receiving $4,700 from Tom Welch,  
former president of the Salt Lake City bid organizers, but he 
called it a personal contribution for an unsuccessful campaign for 
Chile's congress in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	An ethics report on the bribery scandal surrounding Salt Lake  
City's successful quest for the 2002 Winter Games identified 24 IOC 
members -- a fifth of the membership -- who benefited from $1.2 
million in cash, travel, medical care and other favors from Utah 
bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine members have resigned or been expelled. The IOC will hold a  
special session in Lausanne, Switzerland, March 17-18 to endorse 
the expulsions and consider reforms.

<HEADLINE> Tyson To Go It Alone During Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- Mike Tyson is handling this fight without  
the help of trainers, managers or lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The former world heavyweight champion planned to defend himself  
during a disciplinary hearing today against accusations he threw a 
television set in a jail recreational room last Friday when a guard 
hung up a telephone he was using. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no right to counsel in disciplinary hearings,'' said  
Tyson's attorney, Paul Kemp, who met with Tyson on Tuesday to 
discuss today's proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
	Kemp described Tyson as ``bewildered and confused.'' He said  
Friday's outburst came after a psychiatrist contracted by the jail 
took Tyson off an antidepressant drug that he had been taking for 
four months. Corrections officials have since allowed him to resume 
taking the medication, Kemp said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's could have asked a fellow inmate or member of the jail's  
staff to represent him during today's closed disciplinary hearing, 
said Eric Seleznow, a spokesman or the Montgomery County Department 
of Corrections and Rehabilitation. ``Most people don't do that,'' 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't look good for Mike,'' said a Tyson adviser who  
spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``Mike's never good in these 
situations. He can't defend himself well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson faces accusations of disorderly conduct, destroying  
property and assaulting a correctional officer who was allegedly 
struck with shards of plastic from the television. 
</P>
<P>
	No criminal charges are pending, said Seleznow. But he said  
Tyson could lose some privileges, such as visitation rights and 
telephone calls, and any good time served could be discounted. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a routine hearing. We have 15 to 20 of them a week,''  
Seleznow said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson has not had contact with the other inmates since Friday,  
when he was placed in solitary confinement after his alleged 
outburst. Before then, he had begun serving a one-year sentence in 
a private cell, but was in a block with the jail's regular 
population of inmates who are awaiting trial or serving sentences 
of 18 months or less. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson was sentenced Feb. 5 after pleading no-contest to charges  
he assaulted two men after a minor traffic accident last August. He 
has until March 7 to appeal the sentence. Kemp said he would 
probably decide whether to appeal today or Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's alleged outburst occurred after jail officials began  
withholding his daily dose of Zoloft, Kemp said. Tyson received no 
medication Thursday or Friday even though the judge recommended 
Tyson remain on his medication when he sentenced Tyson, Kemp said. 
</P>
<P>
	The jail psychiatrist will not give medication to inmates unless  
they consult with him, Kemp said. He added that Tyson does not want 
to see that doctor because he has been under the care of a Dr. 
Richard Goldberg, chairman of the psychiatry department at 
Georgetown University Medical Center, who saw him Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Browns May Use Detmer As Teacher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- If Ty Detmer is going to be his teacher, Tim  
Couch promises he'll study hard. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cleveland Browns have agreed with Detmer on a seven-year  
contract with the idea he'll start at quarterback for the expansion 
club next season while serving as a mentor to the Browns' QB of the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	And it looks more and more likely that quarterback will be  
Couch, the Kentucky All-American who on Tuesday said he liked the 
idea of being Detmer's pupil. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be great,'' Couch said by phone from  
Lexington, Ky. ``He has been in the league for a long time and he 
could do nothing but help me. I could learn a lot under him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After being chased by the Browns for two weeks, the 31-year-old  
Detmer finally agreed to come to Cleveland on Monday by approving a 
trade with the San Francisco 49ers. He was hunting cougar with 
friends in Utah when his agent finally tracked him down. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ty has verbally approved the deal and it's subject to the  
documentation of the Browns,'' Detmer's agent, Don Yee, said. 
``Ty's very excited to be heading to Cleveland and is looking 
forward to contributing to the Browns in any way he can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, that will be as the Browns starter, but if the team  
uses its No. 1 pick in April's NFL college draft on Couch, Detmer 
will find himself once again in the role of backup. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns were awaiting completion of paperwork before formally  
announcing Detmer's signing, team spokesman Alex Martins said 
Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland and San Francisco will swap picks in the fourth round  
and the Browns' first pick in the fifth round will go to San 
Francisco for Detmer, who has completed 407 passes for 4,807 yards 
and 27 touchdowns in 44 NFL games. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams were close to finalizing a deal on Feb. 9 during the  
expansion draft, but Detmer used a no-trade provision in his 
contract. The Browns did acquire tight end Irv Smith and defensive 
end Roy Barker from San Francisco, but Detmer was the player they 
wanted most. 
</P>
<P>
	Dwight Clark, Cleveland's director of football operations, has  
been a fan of Detmer for years. When he was with San Francisco, 
Clark attempted to trade for Detmer, who was then starting in 
Philadelphia. Following the 1997 season, Clark wanted to sign 
Detmer, a free agent, to a 10-year contract but settled for a 
five-year, $4 million deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Detmer was in the second year of that deal with the 49ers which  
paid him about $800,000 per season. In his new deal with the 
Browns, Detmer will make $3 million in 1999 and $14 million for the 
entire contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``The deal is designed to give him longevity,'' said Browns  
president Carmen Policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Policy signed Detmer before last season to be Steve Young's  
backup in San Francisco and to help bring along 1997 first-round 
draft pick Jim Druckenmiller. Before joining the 49ers, Detmer 
spent two years as a starter for the Eagles and served as Brett 
Favre's backup in Green Bay for almost four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Detmer set 59 NCAA records during his career at Brigham Young,  
and won the Heisman Trophy with the Cougars in 1990 after passing 
for more than 5,000 yards and 41 TDs as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch was just a kid then, but remembers watching Detmer shred  
defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I followed him when he was at BYU and I'm familiar with the  
kind of offense he ran there because we ran BYU's offense at 
Kentucky,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch, who will work out for the Browns on March 11 in  
Lexington, got his first chance to meet with Cleveland coach Chris 
Palmer during last week's scouting combine in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it went great,'' Couch said. ``It was just nice to  
sit down and talk football with him. I'm sure we'll talk more 
in-depth later, but we just talked about basic football stuff, 
coverages and stuff like that.''

<HEADLINE> Mo. Executes 1st Since Pope's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POTOSI, Mo. (AP) -- A man who stabbed two people to death was  
executed by injection early Wednesday, the first Missouri execution 
since the governor commuted the death sentence of a killer last 
month following a face-to-face request by Pope John Paul II. 
</P>
<P>
	James Edward Rodden, 38, offered no last words.  
</P>
<P>
	He was sentenced to death for the 1983 murder of Terry Trunnel.  
Rodden met Trunnel at a bar, then took her back to an apartment he 
shared with Joseph Arnold, who he also stabbed to death, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodden maintained that Arnold killed Trunnel, and then he killed  
Arnold in self defense. Following separate trials, Rodden was given 
the death sentence for killing Trunnel and life in prison for 
killing Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the pope's January visit to St. Louis, Gov. Mel  
Carnahan commuted the death sentence of Darrell Mease to life in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Mease had been sentenced to die for killing a partner and the  
man's wife and grandson in southwest Missouri in 1988.

<HEADLINE> Liquor Cos. Mull TV Ad Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Liquor makers are hearing from the advertising  
agency behind memorable campaigns for milk and pork as they 
consider developing TV commercials and other ads to convert beer 
and wine drinkers. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry's trade group heard a presentation in December from  
an arm of the agency Bozell Worldwide, which developed the 
milk-mustache campaign for the dairy industry and tagged pork as 
``the other white meat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bozell is considering mounting an ad campaign on behalf of the  
liquor industry as U.S. consumption of scotch, gin, rum and other 
distilled spirits has begun to stabilize after years of steady 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of liquor advertising fear such a campaign would be  
designed to make imbibing as routine as having a beer has become 
for many people. 
</P>
<P>
	``The danger is that liquor becomes viewed as just another  
liquid,'' said George Hacker, who monitors alcohol marketing for 
the consumer group Center for Science in the Public Interest. 
</P>
<P>
	But a spokeswoman for the industry's main trade group said  
Tuesday that the examination of whether to back a generic campaign 
on behalf of distilled drinks is preliminary and no decisions have 
been made. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all in the developmental stage,'' said Judy Blatman, a  
spokeswoman for the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States. 
``At this point, there is no budget, no campaign, no media schedule 
-- nothing that has been approved.'' She declined to offer a 
timetable for a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The liquor business has been increasingly envious of the  
relative freedom the beer and wine industry have to advertise on 
radio and TV. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, its sales have been slumping. Consumption of  
distilled spirits dropped 20 percent from 1985 to 1995, although it 
has edged up 1 percent over the next two years, according to the 
Adam's Business Media Liquor Handbook. U.S. liquor sales in 1997 
were estimated at $33.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The consideration of an industry ad campaign also comes a little  
more than two years after liquor makers dumped a self-imposed ban 
against advertising on radio and TV that had been in place for 
nearly 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Blatman said more than 1,000 radio and TV outlets have carried  
liquor ads since the industry lifted the ban in November 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, she said a Washington, D.C., television station ran  
an ad the group prepared comparing alcohol content in typical 
servings of beer, wine and alcohol for six weeks last summer. But 
she said the commercial only ran as part of the trade group's 
sponsorship of a tennis tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The major broadcast networks and several cable networks,  
including CNN, TNT, A&AMP;E, Lifetime and the USA Network, have refused 
to take distilled spirits ads. 
</P>
<P>
	Hacker, who said he has seen portions of a memo from the New  
York Media arm of Bozell Worldwide for the trade group, said it 
mentions spending up to $40 million for on broadcast ads, heavily 
weighted toward cable TV. He estimated individual liquor companies 
spent about $10 million on TV and radio ads for their brands in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	But he added the memo indicates ``they are considering a number  
of options'' including less dramatic efforts as well. ``This hasn't 
gotten very far. It is still a preliminary proposal,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bozell referred calls on the matter to the trade association.  
Blatman declined to provide details of Bozell's memo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal had reported on the proposal Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``It would be silly for us to talk about any plans until  
something is finalized,'' Blatman said.

<HEADLINE> NBC To Air Clinton Accuser's Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC said it will broadcast its interview with  
Juanita Broaddrick, an Arkansas woman who claims she was sexually 
assaulted by Bill Clinton 20 years ago, on ``Dateline NBC'' 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's Lisa Myers interviewed Broaddrick in January. While the  
network continued to check her allegations, The Wall Street Journal 
ran a story Friday based on Broaddrick's charges and other media 
organizations followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC News President Andy Lack said the network wanted to be  
careful to check all of the facts in the story before airing it and 
wasn't angry that others had beaten NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's lawyers said Mrs. Broaddrick's allegations  
were ``absolutely false.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Broaddrick said she first met Clinton in 1978 when he was  
running for governor and she was a campaign worker. A week after 
meeting him, she was in Little Rock, Ark., at a seminar and 
arranged to meet Clinton, then Arkansas' attorney general, for 
coffee at her hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	They went to a hotel room, where Clinton forced her to have sex,  
she claims. ``I was sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton,'' she has 
told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Myers' interview with Broaddrick quickly circulated within the  
media, with some conservative groups charging that NBC sat on the 
interview because it was embarrassing to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone involved in the process knows there's no truth to  
that,'' Lack said Tuesday. He said NBC planned to run the story on 
the first ``Dateline NBC'' available as soon as the reporting was 
complete. NBC finished its reporting Tuesday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The timing of the broadcast had nothing to do with the end of  
Clinton's impeachment trial, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have a story that was 21 years ago, that involves  
lots of information and facts and involves serious charges, you 
need to do a lot of checking,'' he said. ``And that's what we were 
doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lack said he found it ``odd'' that NBC was criticized for taking  
too much time in reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	``You wouldn't have asked that question a few years ago,'' he  
said. ``That is unfortunately some of the fallout of the pace of 
journalism over the past few years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Broaddrick said that she was telling her story to counter  
rumors that she had been bribed and intimidated to stay quiet. She 
complained that NBC had let her ``hang out to dry'' by waiting to 
air the interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Lack said he would not comment on Mrs. Broaddrick's complaints.  
</P>
<P>
	The interview airs at 8 p.m. EST Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Woods Leaves Regular Caddie At Home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- Tiger Woods sees the Match Play  
Championship as a chance to help a friend pay for medical school -- 
even if that means leaving Fluff Cowan off the bag this week with a 
$1 million first prize on the line. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second time in three weeks, Woods' popular and proven  
caddie will be staying home. In his place is Bryon Bell, a 
23-year-old college graduate who is trying to get in to medical 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a chance to help put a guy through medical school,''  
Woods said Wednesday. ``I feel pretty good about having a chance to 
do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cowan was the longtime caddie for Peter Jacobsen, then took  
Woods' bag when he turned pro after winning his third straight U.S. 
Amateur. Woods won twice in just eight starts, then soared to the 
top of golf by winning the Masters and three other tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods said he's not having any problems with Cowan, and said  
Cowan didn't mind taking the week off. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been taken pretty good care of,'' Woods said.  
</P>
<P>
	Woods has won nearly $6 million alone in the PGA Tour, meaning  
Cowan has probably earned close to $600,000 in less than three 
years as his caddie. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell and Woods have been friends since junior high school, and  
they played high school golf together in Cypress, Calif. He 
recently graduated from the University of California-San Diego and 
has applications out to several medical schools. 
</P>
<P>
	That Woods would use a friend as a caddie in a major event is  
surprising, although Woods says Bell has a good track record. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, Bell was on the bag in the Buick Invitational,  
when Woods eagled the last hole for a two-stroke win over Billy Ray 
Brown and his first victory in nine months. Bell also caddied for 
him when Woods won the Southern California Amateur, and U.S. 
Amateur qualifying tournament and the 1996 U.S. Amateur. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've never lost a tournament together,'' Woods said. ``Being  
4-0, I'd say that's a pretty good record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell was stepping off the yardage Tuesday at La Costa Resort,  
but said he doesn't get too involved with club selection. 
</P>
<P>
	A victory by Woods, ranked No. 1 in the world, would be worth  
about $100,000 to Bell and probably take care of medical school 
costs. Woods earned $486,000 for winning the Buick Invitational, 
and Bell put tuition and cost-of-living for four years of school at 
about $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowan was on the bag last week when Woods finished two strokes  
behind winner Ernie Els, but Bell said he wasn't too surprised when 
Woods asked him to join him at La Costa. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the Buick, I figured anything was possible,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Net Catches More Fund Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For many mutual fund investors, the Era of the  
Internet isn't some vision of the future. It is already happening, 
and fast. 
</P>
<P>
	Fund shareholders in rapidly rising numbers are hooking up to  
the 'Net as a way to research and track funds, check their accounts 
and even buy or redeem fund shares. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, 41.5 percent of the transactions in Charles Schwab &AMP;  
Co.'s OneSource fund supermarket were conducted on the World Wide 
Web, according to Schwab spokesman Dan Hubbard. That's up from 
about 29 percent six months before. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Vanguard Group, one of largest fund families, spokesman  
Brian Mattes says about 35 percent of all contacts with present and 
prospective investors now occur on the Web, compared to about 10 
percent four or five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm an Internet-based client of Vanguard's,'' says John  
Brennan, who is also the firm's chairman and chief executive. 
``I've found the Web to be very beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I need to get information about my account, I can do so  
with the click of a mouse. I get my fund statements, prospectuses 
and fund reports online. It has made a huge difference in the 
amount of mail I receive, and it's more convenient, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No question, real progress is occurring here. Anyone who has  
ever bought fund shares through the mail (stamps, envelope, wait a 
week or more for the confirmation to come back) can appreciate the 
efficiency of investing on the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Real-time account statements, available 24 hours a day, make a  
lot more sense than documents mailed every quarter, which are in 
many ways outdated before they arrive. 
</P>
<P>
	Fund companies are happy with all this, too. An investor's  
request for prospectuses and other information, which used to cost 
several dollars to process by mail, can now be answered for pennies 
on a fund family's Website. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are also some problems that can arise for fund  
investors. First of all, in making it much easier, simpler and 
faster to buy and redeem fund investments, the Internet increases 
the temptation to trade too often. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a little bit like the situation that arises with E-mail, as  
opposed to old-fashioned conventional mail. Have you ever had 
second thoughts about a letter you wrote in anger or enthusiasm, 
and put it back into your pocket instead of dropping it down the 
mail chute? 
</P>
<P>
	Quite often these days, ill-considered missives get sent to  
E-mail addressees with a click of the ``send'' button, before the 
writer has a chance to cool down. 
</P>
<P>
	When you get access to your fund accounts through a personal  
computer, there's nobody at the other end of the line to say, ``are 
you sure you want to do that now?'' or even just to read back your 
order to you, forcing you to consider it a little more 
dispassionately. The impulse to act all too quickly becomes an 
executed transaction. 
</P>
<P>
	This note of caution goes double for investors in  
employer-sponsored retirement vehicles such as 401(k) accounts, as 
more and more plans begin to conduct business through Websites. In 
401(k)s, the urge to over-trade isn't even restrained by the fear 
of tax consequences, since no taxes are levied until withdrawals 
are made from the account. 
</P>
<P>
	Another hazard of the 'Net: Amid the abundance of information,  
there are precious few mechanisms available to separate documented 
fact from gossip or accurate data from errors. 
</P>
<P>
	As Brennan put it at a recent meeting with reporters: ``Are  
Online investors aware that the data so readily available to them -- 
in chat rooms, for instance -- may be neither knowledge nor wisdom? 
And that it may not provide the instant answers they seek?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, he said, ``one of our constant and long-term  
concerns is that the Internet can also be an excellent tool for 
fraud. Anyone can post a Website or place a message on an online 
bulletin board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amid complications such as these, the 'Net may paradoxically  
increase demand among investors for low-tech human help and advice, 
Brennan suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	``I doubt that a Website will ever completely replace people,''  
he concludes. ``I suspect more shareholders will look to Websites 
for routine matters and to informed personnel for more complicated 
matters.''

<HEADLINE>  Wall St. Stocks End Lower / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow industrials gave some ground Tuesday,  
but technology shares pushed the broad market higher after Federal 
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan hinted that the central bank is 
more inclined to lift interest rates than cut them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average finished 8.26 lower at  
9,544.42. The blue-chip index swung narrowly all day, as market 
pundits took stabs at interpreting Greenspan's semiannual testimony 
before the Senate Banking Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Strength in technology shares, particularly in Internet-related  
stocks, pushed the Nasdaq composite up 34.34 at 2.376.35. The 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, however, slipped 0.96 to 1,271.18. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues led advancers by nearly a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. NYSE composite volume totaled 951.94 
million shares, surpassing Monday's tally. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan suggested the economy no longer needs the extra  
stimulus that three interest-rate cuts provided last autumn. 
Indeed, he indicated that further rate cuts could add too much wood 
to the fire and stoke inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Federal Reserve must continue to evaluate, among other  
issues, whether the full extent of the policy easings undertaken 
last fall to address the seizing-up of financial markets remains 
appropriate as those disturbances abate,'' the chairman said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the stock market, Greenspan echoed his late 1996 warning  
about ``irrational exuberance,'' saying that ``equity prices are 
high enough to raise questions about whether shares are 
overvalued.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ned Riley, chief investment officer at BankBoston, said stocks  
foundered ``simply because people want a little bit more clarity 
from Greenspan. He was sufficiently evasive in his first day of 
testimony to not lead either the bulls or the bears in a certain 
direction.'' Greenspan will testify before the House Ways and Means 
Committee on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue chips opened lower and then recovered, only to retreat a  
second time, as bond prices weakened throughout the session. 
Interest rates rose in the bond market after Greenspan said that 
while he expects continued growth in the economy, the possibility 
of higher inflation or a sharp stock market drop do pose a threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in New York, the Conference Board reported that  
consumer confidence rose for the fourth straight month in February. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year Treasury bond fell about $10 per $1,000 value in  
price. Its yield, which rises when prices fall, rose to 5.42 
percent from 5.35 percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow's 30 components were broadly mixed.  
</P>
<P>
	Banking and financial shares, which often move in tandem with  
bond prices, advanced, with Citigroup rising 2 3/4 to 58 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug and consumer stocks, considered safer bets in times of  
economic uncertainty, fell. But economically sensitive shares such 
as manufacturers also retreated. Procter &AMP; Gamble fell 2 1/4 to 90 3/4 
and General Motors dropped 1 15/16 to 85 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer-related stocks resumed a leadership role. Microsoft  
shares climbed 6 5/8 to 155 7/16 in Nasdaq trading after Morgan 
Stanley Dean Witter analyst Mary Meeker said the software maker 
shouldn't be much damaged by its antitrust suit. Meeker also said 
the outlook for companies that do business on the Internet remains 
very strong. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet service provider America Online led the advancers on  
the Big Board, rising 1 1/8 to 88 after a two-for-one stock split took 
effect. Yahoo! rose 7 1/8 to 152 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	In other market action, the NYSE composite index fell 2.21 to  
598.02, and the American Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.89 
to 700.92. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.19 to 
399.01. 
</P>
<P>
	In overseas trading, the Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo climbed 1.71  
percent. In Europe, Frankfurt's DAX soared 2.94 percent on the 
strength of some earnings reports. The FT-SE 100 in London added 
1.41 percent, and the CAC index in Paris climbed 1.01 percent.

<HEADLINE>  Dragging Death Case Goes to Jury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- Prosecutors likened John William King to  
``riders coming straight out of hell'' as they urged a jury to 
convict him of dragging a black man to his death. 
</P>
<P>
	In closing arguments before the case went to the jury, Jasper  
County assistant prosecutor Pat Hardy outlined evidence against 
King and said it was clear. 
</P>
<P>
	``You saw it,'' he told jurors. ``It was obvious the man was  
dragged to death behind a vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	``After they dragged that poor man and dragged him to pieces,  
they dropped him at a cemetery to show their defiance to God and 
Christianity and everything most people in this county stand for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old King, an alleged white supremacist, is the first  
of three white men to be tried for James Byrd Jr.'s slaying last 
June 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardy said King and his two co-defendants were ``three rogue  
riders coming straight out of hell. ... Instead of a rope they used 
a chain and instead of horses, they were using a pickup truck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd's tortured body was torn to pieces as he was dragged by a  
pickup truck for nearly three miles. Prosecutors argued the 
49-year-old man was conscious, suffering horribly as he vainly 
tried to save himself during a part of the way. 
</P>
<P>
	To get the death penalty, prosecutors must show Byrd's murder  
also occurred in conjunction with another crime, and argue the 
abduction of Byrd amounted to kidnapping. In his closing, defense 
attorney Brack Jones concentrated on the kidnapping argument. 
</P>
<P>
	He acknowledged a ``terrible, terrible brutal horrendous  
death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``No question. The question is: Was Mr. Byrd kidnapped?''  
</P>
<P>
	Jones said he believed the tying of Byrd's feet and the dragging  
was the method of death and not intentional kidnapping. 
</P>
<P>
	``We say the tattoo evidence doesn't prove kidnapping,'' he  
said, referring to King's numerous racist tattoos. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. King's writings do not prove kidnapping,'' he said,  
referring to numerous letters King wrote about forming a new racist 
organization in Jasper. 
</P>
<P>
	Said King's other attorney, Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs: ``I don't  
deny he made some racial slurs. Not that I agree with that. But 
that is his right. You have a right to be a racist. Right or wrong, 
you still have that right. You have a right to even be a satanist, 
but that is our right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A pathologist Monday testified Byrd was dragged alive and in  
excruciating pain along the bumpy county road. When the pickup 
swerved into a left-hand curve, Byrd's chained body swung to the 
right, where he was beheaded by a concrete culvert. 
</P>
<P>
	An ex-convict with dreams of starting his own racist group, King  
had been waiting for an opportunity to make a name for himself and 
his fledgling white supremacy group, the Texas Rebel Soldiers, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	While in prison, King told one inmate he wanted to ``take a  
black out'' to prove himself as a white supremacist. He covered 
himself in racist tattoos, his defense attorneys contended, to 
prevent attacks from the mostly black population at Beto. 
</P>
<P>
	The unemployed laborer's fondness for writing severely  
jeopardized his case. Before his letters surfaced, investigators 
had only a cigarette lighter and his DNA on cigarette butts to tie 
him to the crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
	But King revealed more information. In letters to co-defendant  
Lawrence Russell Brewer, he revealed that blood-stained clothing, 
missed by police, was still in his apartment. DNA tests showed the 
blood was Byrd's. 
</P>
<P>
	In a November letter to The Dallas Morning News, King admitted  
he had been riding in the truck with Brewer and the other 
co-defendant, Shawn Berry, on June 7 when they offered a ride to 
Byrd. 
</P>
<P>
	Until that letter, there were no witnesses to place King in the  
truck at the same time as Byrd. King insisted he had been taken 
home before Byrd was killed. But a letter to Brewer indicated 
otherwise.

	``Rodent Weekend '76-'96 (Approximately)'' (Gadfly) -- Tonio K.  

</P>
<P>
	This set unearths 19 rarities and previously unreleased songs  
from an obscure artist who has been consigned to the fringe of the 
rock scene for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	How good can such a compilation be? Better than 99 percent of  
what will be released this year, that's all. 
</P>
<P>
	Since his first record in 1978, Tonio K. has earned critical  
raves and a small but loyal fan following for his warped wit, 
skewed sensibility and straightforward guitar rock. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rodent Weekend '76-'96 (Approximately)'' offers more of the  
same, although the tunes may be even more twisted than usual. Among 
the highlights: 
</P>
<P>
	-- The couplet ``Mars needs women/you should apply'';  
</P>
<P>
	-- The uncharacteristically lush and lovely ``The Hunter'';  
</P>
<P>
	-- ``I'm Supposed to Have Sex With You,'' a 1987 radio hit that  
unfortunately was unavailable in stores at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	The hilarious liner notes alone are worth the price of  
admission. They include a two-page list of songs Tonio K. wrote but 
never bothered to record, including ``10,000 Dentists,'' ``Your 
Song (Not That One)'' and ``Maybe Tomorrow (I'll Want You 
Tonight).'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is hoped that they'll be on his next retrospective.  
</P>

	``32 Gems From 32 Jazz'' (32 Jazz) -- Various Artists  

</P>
<P>
	Spinning this trio of CDs is like listening to a terrific jazz  
radio station for 3 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The array of talent in this sampler from the 3-year-old 32 Jazz  
label is impressive. It includes Kenny Barron, Ron Carter, Rahsaan 
Roland Kirk, Pat Martino, Woody Shaw, Horace Silver, Zoot Sims and 
Sonny Stitt. 
</P>
<P>
	The performances, many of them reissues from the Muse and  
Landmark catalogs, date back as far as 1965. They cover a gamut of 
arrangements and styles, from duet to big band and from organ funk 
to free jazz. There are numerous highlights and nary a cut that 
should be skipped, although Kirk's eight-minute ``Passion Dance'' 
isn't for the faint of heart.

	``1999 Grammy Rap Nominees'' (Elektra) -- Various  

</P>
<P>
	The music industry deserves applause for deciding in the past  
couple of years to honor its achievers with albums of Grammy 
nominees. Only recently did record companies begrudgingly accept 
the concept of compilation albums, so working together here is a 
big step. 
</P>
<P>
	Elektra does the honors this year with two separate packages,  
including one focused solely on rap. The first compilation wisely 
includes the five record of the year nominees and five samples from 
the best new artist competitors. Elektra rounds out the album with 
the five male pop vocal nominees, a seemingly arbitrary choice and 
not necessarily the best. Why not mix it up? 
</P>
<P>
	The rap collection, with Busta Rhymes, Wyclef Jean, Will Smith,  
Lauryn Hill and others, is a fine idea. Rap is ultimately a singles 
medium, and collecting the year's best of what has become the 
dominant musical form for young people is smart. 
</P>
<P>
	What's missing is some kind of third collection that goes beyond  
the obvious and honors some critical favorites. How about mixing 
and matching Lucinda Williams, Daft Punk, Marilyn Manson, Brian 
McKnight and Enrique Iglesias? It may not have a target demographic 
group but it sure would be fun.

	``No Exit'' (Beyond) -- Blondie  

</P>
<P>
	If only all ``comebacking'' rock bands could have a moment as  
wonderful as ``Maria,'' Blondie's first single since the group 
disbanded 16 years ago. Deborah Harry's vocal is warm and inviting, 
the melody effortless. It has all the sass and classicism of the 
old Blondie. 
</P>
<P>
	The reality is most rock reunions are as depressing as the rest  
of this album. ``No Exit'' suffers from leaden execution and too 
many bad 1980s flashbacks, noteworthy considering the band barely 
made it to the 1980s. Blondie's restless musicality -- a ``punk'' 
band that mastered disco and rap -- once served it well. Here the 
excursions into rap, ska, lounge and dance music seem like grasping 
at straws. 
</P>
<P>
	Blondie can rightfully say it never got its due in its first  
incarnation. But they do that memory no favors here.

<HEADLINE>  Wall St. Stocks End Lower / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow industrials gave some ground Tuesday,  
but technology shares pushed the broad market higher after Federal 
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan hinted that the central bank is 
more inclined to lift interest rates than cut them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average finished 8.26 lower at  
9,544.42. The blue-chip index swung narrowly all day, as market 
pundits took stabs at interpreting Greenspan's semiannual testimony 
before the Senate Banking Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Strength in technology shares, particularly in Internet-related  
stocks, pushed the Nasdaq composite up 34.34 at 2.376.35. The 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, however, slipped 0.96 to 1,271.18. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues led advancers by nearly a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. NYSE composite volume totaled 951.94 
million shares, surpassing Monday's tally. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan suggested the economy no longer needs the extra  
stimulus that three interest-rate cuts provided last autumn. 
Indeed, he indicated that further rate cuts could add too much wood 
to the fire and stoke inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Federal Reserve must continue to evaluate, among other  
issues, whether the full extent of the policy easings undertaken 
last fall to address the seizing-up of financial markets remains 
appropriate as those disturbances abate,'' the chairman said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the stock market, Greenspan echoed his late 1996 warning  
about ``irrational exuberance,'' saying that ``equity prices are 
high enough to raise questions about whether shares are 
overvalued.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ned Riley, chief investment officer at BankBoston, said stocks  
foundered ``simply because people want a little bit more clarity 
from Greenspan. He was sufficiently evasive in his first day of 
testimony to not lead either the bulls or the bears in a certain 
direction.'' Greenspan will testify before the House Ways and Means 
Committee on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue chips opened lower and then recovered, only to retreat a  
second time, as bond prices weakened throughout the session. 
Interest rates rose in the bond market after Greenspan said that 
while he expects continued growth in the economy, the possibility 
of higher inflation or a sharp stock market drop do pose a threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in New York, the Conference Board reported that  
consumer confidence rose for the fourth straight month in February. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year Treasury bond fell about $10 per $1,000 value in  
price. Its yield, which rises when prices fall, rose to 5.42 
percent from 5.35 percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow's 30 components were broadly mixed.  
</P>
<P>
	Banking and financial shares, which often move in tandem with  
bond prices, advanced, with Citigroup rising 2 3/4 to 58 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug and consumer stocks, considered safer bets in times of  
economic uncertainty, fell. But economically sensitive shares such 
as manufacturers also retreated. Procter &AMP; Gamble fell 2 1/4 to 90 3/4 
and General Motors dropped 1 15/16 to 85 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer-related stocks resumed a leadership role. Microsoft  
shares climbed 6 5/8 to 155 7/16 in Nasdaq trading after Morgan 
Stanley Dean Witter analyst Mary Meeker said the software maker 
shouldn't be much damaged by its antitrust suit. Meeker also said 
the outlook for companies that do business on the Internet remains 
very strong. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet service provider America Online led the advancers on  
the Big Board, rising 1 1/8 to 88 after a two-for-one stock split took 
effect. Yahoo! rose 7 1/8 to 152 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	In other market action, the NYSE composite index fell 2.21 to  
598.02, and the American Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.89 
to 700.92. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.19 to 
399.01. 
</P>
<P>
	In overseas trading, the Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo climbed 1.71  
percent. In Europe, Frankfurt's DAX soared 2.94 percent on the 
strength of some earnings reports. The FT-SE 100 in London added 
1.41 percent, and the CAC index in Paris climbed 1.01 percent.

</P>
<P>
	The stock split two for one, effective Tuesday.  

</P>
<P>
 *Compaq Computer rose 1 5/8 to 44 1/4.    	
</P>
<P>
	The computer maker said a planned redemption of preferred shares

for Compaq.'' 

</P>

</P>
<P>
 *Columbia/HCA Healthcare rose 3/8 to 18 3/4.    	
</P>
<P>
	Fourth-quarter net income of 4 cents per share fell far short of  
analysts' expected 23 cents. But the company said it issued a $1 
billion letter of credit to the Justice Department. Analysts took 
that to mean the company might be ready to settle with the 
government, which has been investigating the company for billing 
fraud. Columbia said the $1 billion figure was not related to how 
big a fine it might pay as part of any settlement. 

</P>
<P>
 *Dollar General Corp. rose 2 5/16 to 29 7/8.    	
</P>
<P>
	The retailer beat analysts' expectations for fourth-quarter  
earnings, helped by a lower tax rate and lower-than-expected 
operating expenses. Profits were 36 cents a share for the quarter 
ended Jan. 29, compared with 30 cents a year earlier and the First 
Call Corp. consensus estimate of 33 cents. 

</P>
<P>
 *US West Inc. fell 4 9/16 to 57 5/8    	
</P>
<P>
	The Denver-based regional telephone operating company said  
increased capital spending will reduce earnings growth this year to 
10 percent from a previously projected 12 percent to 14 percent. 

</P>
<P>
 *Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc., down 4 5/8 to 31 3/16    	
</P>
<P>
	The giant bookseller warned of lower-than-expected profits for  
its last fiscal year and slower earnings growth in the future, 
projecting earnings of 76 cents a share for the year ended in 
January, below the 80 cents that Wall Street analysts' had 
anticipated.

</P>
<P>
	The bank-holding company will replace Oryx Energy Co. in the  
Standard &AMP; Poor 500 Index, according to analysts. Oryx is being 
acquired by S&AMP;P component Kerr-McGee Corp. 

</P>
<P>
 *Broadcast.com rose 8 3/16 to 78 1/2.  
</P>
<P>
 *Trimark Holdings Inc. rose 21/32 to 7 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Trimark agreed to license its movies to Broadcast.com in a deal  
that will give each company a minority stake in the other. 

</P>
<P>
 *Concentric Network Corp. fell 5/8 to 43 7/8.    	
</P>
<P>
	The company, which sells technology that enables small- and

<HEADLINE> U.S. Launches 2 Foreign Satellites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) -- Three satellites,  
including the first built by South Africa and Denmark, were 
launched into orbit Tuesday aboard a single Delta II rocket. 
</P>
<P>
	The rocket lifted off before daybreak after 11 mostly  
weather-related delays. 
</P>
<P>
	It released the Air Force's Advanced Research and Global  
Observation Satellite, or Argos; South Africa's Sunsat spacecraft; 
and Denmark's Orsted. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunsat was created by engineering students in South Africa,  
primarily to show that they could do it. Orsted will map Earth's 
magnetic field. Argos was designed to conduct research on military 
and space technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Though small, the 130-pound satellite from South Africa and the  
136-pound one from Denmark represent those nations' entry into the 
club of spacefaring countries. Argos, by contrast, weighs 3 tons 
and is loaded down with research gear. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunsat was also symbolic of South Africa's return to  
collaboration with the international science community after being 
isolated during the apartheid era. 
</P>
<P>
	The repeated delays had become a source of jokes in Denmark. On  
Danish postal stamps, however, the satellite has been circling 
Earth since January.

<HEADLINE> Energy Futures Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude and its products rose in futures trading on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange amid anticipation that cold weather in major 
heating regions would boost demand. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, coffee and beef futures rose sharply.  
</P>
<P>
	Crude rose despite expectations the American Petroleum Institute  
would report yet another weekly increase in inventories. Market 
participants said below-normal temperatures in the Midwest that 
were moving into the Northeast could help diminish ample heating 
oil supplies as the winter heating season comes to a close. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices have been on the defensive for weeks as supplies  
continue to grow during what has been a relatively mild winter. 
Crude stockpiles also are increasing as world oil producers fail to 
adequately reduce output in the face of sharply lower world demand. 
</P>
<P>
	The late-season cold snap is unlikely to change that scenario,  
analysts said. And the National Weather Service's latest 10-day 
forecast predicts a return to above-normal temperatures in both the 
Midwest and Northeast in just a few days. 
</P>
<P>
	But crude and its products also were supported Tuesday by  
continued talk Tosco Corp. plans to slow production at its large 
Bayway refinery in New Jersey and Trainer facility in Pennsylvania 
-- moves that could limit new supplies of gasoline and heating oil 
to the important Northeast market. The company has denied such 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Light, sweet crude for April delivery rose 41 cents to $12.48 a  
barrel; March heating oil rose 0.97 cent to 31.84 cents a gallon; 
March unleaded gasoline rose 0.14 cent to 34.84 cents a gallon; 
March natural gas rose 0.6 cent to $1.710 for each 1,000 cubic 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent Blend crude oil for delivery in April  
rose 36 cents to $10.94 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	After markets closed, the American Petroleum Institute reported  
that U.S. crude oil stocks rose last week by 1.882 million barrels 
to 334.149 million barrels. Gasoline stocks rose 2.191 million 
barrels to 230.841 million barrels. Refineries were operating at 
94.1 percent capacity compared to 94.4 percent the week before. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures rose sharply on the Board of Trade of the City of  
New York amid reports shipments from Latin American producers in 
January were smaller than originally expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures prices have been in the doldrums amid  
expectations premium Central American beans and lesser-quality 
beans from a bumper Brazilian crop will reach U.S. shores just as 
the peak winter consumption period begins winding down. But the 
National Federation of Coffee Growers in Colombia reported exports 
in January were nearly 10 percent below levels of a year ago, while 
Mexico's crop forecast was revised downward. 
</P>
<P>
	March arabica coffee fell 3.10 cents to $1.059 a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures rose sharply on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange  
after the government said shipments of donated beef to Russia will 
begin in just a few weeks, which could prompt heavy buying on cash 
markets. Pork futures finished mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle rose 1.17 cents to 67.62 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle rose 1.20 cents to 73.97 cents a pound; April lean 
hogs fell 0.55 cent to 45.25 cents a pound; March pork bellies rose 
0.25 cent to 52.80 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Consumer confidence Rises Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Consumer confidence rose for a fourth-straight  
month in February as Americans enjoyed continued U.S. economic 
growth and felt especially secure about the current job market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board reported today its index of consumer  
confidence rose 3.2 points to 132.1 in February from a revised 
128.9 in January. The index dropped sharply in October and has 
since been making a steady recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer sentiment is an important economic indicator since  
consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's overall 
economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers were unfazed by President Clinton's impeachment trial  
and were thoroughly pleased with the current economic situation, 
the report said. The index that measures feelings about present 
conditions rose 5.5 points to 178.4, its highest level ever in the 
32 years that the survey has been compiled by the private 
business-financed study group. 
</P>
<P>
	The index that measures expectations for the next six months was  
also higher, rising 1.6 points to 101.2. 
</P>
<P>
	``President Clinton's personal problems and the impeachment  
trial have had little or no impact on consumer attitudes,'' said 
Lynn Franco, associate director at the New York-based Conference 
Board. ``Consumers continue to be most concerned about their jobs, 
their salaries and the overall health of the economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The survey said it found an all-time low 11.7 percent of  
consumers who reported jobs are hard to get. It also reported more 
Americans said they would buy a car, home or major appliance in the 
next six months. More consumers expect business conditions to get 
better, meaning more jobs and higher paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
	The report comes amid robust economic growth in the United  
States, which is surprising to many economists who had expected the 
pace to slow in early 1999 as problems overseas threatened American 
prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
	Many worry that if economic growth continues in coming months,  
the Federal Reserve will see a need to raise interest rates to 
preserve the economy's low inflation by taking the edge off 
consumer and business buying demand. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer confidence index, started in 1967, is compiled from  
responses to questions sent to 5,000 households nationwide. The 
survey polls consumers on matters ranging from job prospects to 
buying plans. The index compares results to its base year, 1985, 
when it stood at 100.

<HEADLINE> Holyfield, Lewis in Verbal Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lennox Lewis says Evander Holyfield doesn't  
practice what he preaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``He says he's religious, but he's a hypocrite,'' Lewis said of  
the man he hopes to beat for the undisputed heavyweight 
championship March 13 in an already sold-out Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis was referring to Holyfield's public admission last October  
that he has fathered five children out of wedlock with four women 
and that he provides financially for them. Holyfield also has three 
children with his first wife and one with his second. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't bother me,'' Holyfield said by telephone Tuesday  
from Houston, where he training. ``What he saying is I made some 
mistakes. If I can be heavyweight champion of the world and make 
mistakes, why can't I be a man of God and make mistakes? ``Why 
can't I clean myself and get back up? 
</P>
<P>
	``What he's trying to do is psyche himself up,'' Holyfield said  
of the accusations made Monday by Lewis at his training camp at a 
resort hotel near Scot Run, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight is much more a must-win match for Lewis, the  
33-year-old WBC champion from Britain, than it is for the 
36-year-old Holyfield, IBF-WBA champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis, who has fought in the shadows of Holyfield and Mike  
Tyson, feels he had not received his due, especially from the U.S. 
boxing media and American fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is going to be the definitive fight for Lennox  
Lewis,'' Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has to be my biggest fight because it's an upcoming  
fight,'' said Holyfield, who has been in several big matches, 
including his two wins over Tyson, and whose place in boxing 
history is secure. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's coming to a point where I'm about finished,'' Holyfield  
said, then he quickly added that he doesn't plan for this bout to 
be his last.

<HEADLINE> Court Favors NCAA in Sex-Bias Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The NCAA is not subject to a federal sex-bias  
law just because it collects dues from federally financed colleges 
and universities, the Supreme Court ruled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the justices' unanimous decision left open the possibility  
the governing body for college sports may for other reasons be 
covered by the law known as Title IX of the Education Acts of 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Renee Smith, an Ohio woman who says she was illegally declared  
ineligible to play college volleyball, had argued the NCAA could be 
sued under the law because the dues it receives from member schools 
make it an indirect recipient of federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
	But Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for the court, ``At most,  
the association's receipt of dues demonstrates that it indirectly 
benefits from the federal assistance afforded its members.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This showing, without more, is insufficient to trigger Title  
IX coverage,'' Ginsburg said. 
</P>
<P>
	The law bars sex discrimination in educational programs  
receiving federal financial aid. Ginsburg noted that similar 
wording is used in other laws banning discrimination in federally 
funded programs based on race, age or disability. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the NCAA's 1,200 schools receive federal funds and  
therefore are covered by Title IX. The NCAA's lawyers said during 
arguments in January the association itself was not a federal aid 
recipient and that athletes should take up discrimination 
complaints with the individual schools. 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA president Cedric Dempsey said he was pleased with Tuesday's  
decision and was confident lower courts will reject Smith's other 
arguments for allowing her suit to go forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Dempsey added: ``We have consistently said that the NCAA should  
be in compliance with Title IX on a voluntary basis and have worked 
to achieve compliance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a welcome legal victory for the NCAA, which is still  
reeling from a 1997 federal court ruling that the association acted 
unlawfully in capping the salaries of entry-level coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA is also being sued over its decision to require metal  
alloy baseball bats to perform more like traditional wooden bats. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's lawyer, Carter Phillips, discounted the importance of  
this latest ruling, contending Smith has a good chance of 
convincing a lower court she should be allowed to sue the NCAA 
because schools have given it control of athletic programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We clearly live to fight another day,'' Phillips said.  
</P>
<P>
	That view was echoed by Adele Kimmel of the Trial Lawyers for  
Public Justice, which is representing black athletes in a separate 
race-discrimination lawsuit against the NCAA. The Supreme Court 
``was in fact leaving the door open'' to other arguments that the 
NCAA should be covered by the anti-bias laws, Kimmel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who lives in Wintersville, Ohio, played volleyball for  
St. Bonaventure in the 1991-92 and 1992-93 seasons and graduated in 
less than three years. 
</P>
<P>
	She later pursued a graduate degree at Hofstra and a law degree  
at Pittsburgh. At each, her attempts to play two more seasons of 
volleyball were thwarted by an NCAA rule that barred graduate 
students from playing college sports at a school other than the one 
from which they earned their undergraduate degree. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawsuit said the NCAA grants men a disproportionate number  
of waivers from its rules. The NCAA said more men seek waivers but 
that a higher percentage of women receive them. In 1996, the 
association began allowing graduate students to transfer their 
sports eligibility to another school. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge threw out Smith's lawsuit, but the 3rd U.S.  
Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated her Title IX claim last year. 
``The NCAA is not merely an incidental beneficiary of federal 
funds,'' the appeals court said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court disagreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Entities that receive federal assistance, whether directly or  
through an intermediary, are recipients within the meaning of Title 
IX; entities that only benefit economically from federal assistance 
are not,'' Ginsburg wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the justices instructed lower courts to hear Smith's  
arguments that she should be allowed to sue the NCAA under Title IX 
on grounds it receives federal funds through the National Youth 
Sports Program and because schools have given the NCAA controlling 
authority over college athletics.

<HEADLINE> Layoffs Hit Country Music Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- As Shania Twain waited to see how many  
Grammys she would win tonight, some of her country music colleagues 
were in a far less glamorous situation: waiting to see if they 
could find work. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as Twain and Garth Brooks sell millions, the industry has  
been wracked by layoffs. The problem is Nashville's recent 
inability to launch new top-selling acts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The consumer is changing,'' said Joe Galante, who runs the  
Nashville office of RCA Records. ``And I'm not sure everybody's got 
their finger on the pulse. ... Clearly there is a problem in terms 
of what we are doing as an industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After reaching record heights in 1995, country album sales have  
sagged. Last year's sales increase of 2.7 percent was due largely 
to Brooks, who accounted for 10 percent of the nearly 73 million 
albums sold, according to SoundScan, which tracks sales. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Arista Nashville, a division of RCA, fired six  
executives last week. Song publisher Sony/ATV Tree dropped about 
half of its Nashville roster of 100 songwriters in October, citing 
declining royalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercury and MCA Records, owned by Seagram Co., have laid off  
seven country-division employees between them. And the publishing 
divisions of PolyGram and MCA will soon merge, costing jobs in 
Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	Some worry that a repeat of the mid-1980s may be in store.  
That's when the bottom fell out of the boom started by the 1980 
movie ``Urban Cowboy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Even when you're getting a hit, you're not selling as many  
units as you did four years ago,'' Galante said. ``You do 2 million 
(sales) on the Dixie Chicks; a couple of years ago that would have 
been 4 or 5 million.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nashville may be a victim of its own phenomenal success. Revenue  
from the sale of country music albums quadrupled between 1989 and 
1995 to about $2 billion, when Brooks became one of the most 
recognizable celebrities in America. 
</P>
<P>
	As the money rolled in, companies like Warner Bros. and MCA  
built expensive office buildings, gave employees raises and hired 
more people. Now those companies want to cut costs and small labels 
like Rising Tide, Magnatone, Almo Sounds, Imprint and Decca have 
closed their doors in the past couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a total surprise to me, to everybody,'' said Kim  
Fowler, a publicist who had barely started at Rising Tide a year 
ago when the company folded. ``People are getting squeezed out and 
they have nowhere to go in the music business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Promising singers like Shane Stockton, Chris Knight and Matraca  
Berg have lost their record deals. Dolly Parton did, too, when 
Decca closed last month, though she won't have trouble getting 
another. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever you mix art and commerce, you put yourself in danger  
of the current craze or trends or style,'' said Jimmie Fadden of 
The Dirt Band, country music veterans who were about to release an 
album on Rising Tide when the label closed. They have since signed 
with DreamWorks SKG. 
</P>
<P>
	Galante estimated that 10 percent of record company staffers may  
be cut in the long run, and as many as 20 percent of songwriters 
will lose the stipends from publishing companies that allow them to 
write full time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that we're not done with consolidation,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Still, far more country albums are being sold now than a decade  
ago, and country music remains the most popular radio format by 
far. 
</P>
<P>
	Del Bryant of New York-based BMI, which distributes songwriting  
royalties, said all the changes could help in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant, who started his career in the Music City, said larger  
companies will be leaner and the consolidations may allow smaller 
record companies to re-emerge, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nashville is the classic town that takes two steps forward,  
then one step back,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Mark Grace Bulks Up for New Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Mark Grace isn't ready to challenge Sammy  
Sosa to a home run hitting contest. Power isn't his game, never has 
been. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Chicago Cubs first baseman has a bulkier look this  
spring. He's added muscle and toned up from a tougher offseason 
workout program he thought was necessary with his 35th birthday 
fast approaching. 
</P>
<P>
	``From spring training 'till the end of last season, I lost 18  
pounds,'' Grace said Tuesday as he prepared for his first batting 
practice of the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm 34 years old now. I got to do those things to remain  
stronger, so we had to get to it. I see what weight lifting has 
done for so many guys, including No. 21 (Sosa). It's hard to argue 
with the results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grace, a career .310 hitter with just 121 homers, worked four  
days a week for five hours a day with former Cubs trainer John 
Fierro. Grace ran, lifted and went through agility drills. 
</P>
<P>
	He undertook his new conditioning regimen at the suggestion of  
manager Jim Riggleman and general manager Ed Lynch. It's one he 
wants to carry over into the season, although he admitted it's not 
easy to hit the weights after a three-hour game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has not been a part of Mark's routine, and what he is  
hoping to do is get in there more often and maintain his 
strength,'' Riggleman said. ``As he's gotten older, his lifetime 
average has gone up, so we're not trying to reinvent Mark Grace. He 
just doesn't want to feel worn out in September.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grace, who is 125 hits shy of 2,000, will be eligible for free  
agency after this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been a free agent before. If I can go out and have a  
typical year, then I don't see any reason why I won't remain a 
Cub,'' Grace said. ``If I can stay off the DL, then my numbers will 
be fine, and that's what I care about. I'm going to hit over .300, 
hit about 40 doubles and a few homers. My goals are to be on base 
to be driven in, and driving in (other players) when they are out 
there for me. Unfortunately nobody was out there for me last year 
in the second half because Sammy drove them all in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grace has never played for any team other than the Cubs. He's  
been with the club since 1988, longer than anyone else on the 
roster. Staying with the same team throughout a career is nearly 
unheard of in modern baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are things more important than that, like getting to a  
World Series, getting the playoffs again, but I'd love to stay with 
the Cubs. It's the only organization I've ever known,'' Grace said. 
``By the same token, it's also something that rarely happens. I 
would understand if it doesn't happen. It wouldn't be my choice; it 
would be made by the decision makers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Sosa arrives for his first workout Sunday, the hoopla over  
his 66-homer, MVP season will start anew. Grace is ready, saying 
there will be no distractions for a veteran team like the Cubs. 
Players got used to it last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sammy handled it so well, and as long as he does, it won't be  
a distraction,'' Grace said. ``Otherwise, guys like myself might 
step in and say, `Hey, give him some room and let him go.' I think 
Sammy enjoys the attention, and I don't foresee it as a problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grace has been to the playoffs just twice in his career, in 1989  
and again last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was the most fun I ever had, including '89. By far  
the most fun,'' Grace said. ``There are no guarantees, no 
guarantees that Sammy will do those things again, no guarantees 
that any of us will do those things again. We have to go out and 
make it happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Kerry Wood missed his second straight day of drills. He  
still feels weak from a bronchial ailment. ... Mickey Morandini, 
Lance Johnson, Jason Maxwell and Glenallen Hill were early 
arrivals, joining Grace and Jeff Blauser.

<HEADLINE> Ty Detmer Heading to Browns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Ty Detmer is headed to the Cleveland Browns  
after agreeing to a seven-year contract and a trade from the San 
Francisco 49ers, sources told The Associated Press on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Detmer, who had the right to turn down a trade and did so  
several weeks ago, will earn nearly $3 million next season and $14 
million for the entire contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns and 49ers agreed to the deal, but Detmer did not  
approve it until Monday night, said a source who asked not to be 
identified. The seven-year NFL veteran and winner of the 1990 
Heisman Trophy was on a hunting trip in Utah when he agreed to the 
trade and the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns and 49ers worked on a deal involving Detmer for about  
two weeks. Cleveland's president is Carmen Policy, who formerly 
held that position with San Francisco, and the Browns' general 
manager is Dwight Clark, a former 49ers player and executive. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco sent defensive end Roy Barker and tight end Irv  
Smith to the Browns on Feb. 12, after the Browns took 49ers 
cornerback Antonio Langham in the expansion draft Feb. 9, saving 
the 49ers considerable salary cap space. 
</P>
<P>
	Detmer, 31, signed with San Francisco before last season as a  
free agent after two years as a starter for Philadelphia. He also 
spent four years in Green Bay as Brett Favre's backup. 
</P>
<P>
	He would likely be Cleveland's starter and a tutor for Tim Couch  
if the Browns use their first pick in the draft on the Kentucky 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland will swap picks in the fourth round and send a  
fifth-round pick to the 49ers for Detmer, who has completed 407 
passes for 4,807 yards and 27 touchdowns in 44 NFL games.

<HEADLINE> Spring Training Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Ron Gant, still angry at Tony La Russa, accused his former  
manager of racism. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rickey Henderson didn't like him, Royce Clayton didn't like  
him,'' Gant said in Clearwater, Fla. ``He treated Ozzie Smith like 
dirt. Brian Jordan didn't like him. I don't know too many people 
who did like him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All of those players are black.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's called unforgivable,'' La Russa, the St. Louis  
Cardinals manager, said Tuesday. ``That's lower than cheap. But I'm 
not going to sue him. I'll turn the page.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gant, traded to Philadelphia during the offseason, said that  
``if he can't control you as a player, if you're not a `yes' 
player, he doesn't want you. If you have your own opinions, he 
doesn't want you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa wondered what else Gant accused him of.  
</P>
<P>
	``Did he say anything about me kicking animals or robbing old  
ladies?'' the manager said. 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa also fired back about Gant's lack of production. Gant  
struck out 162 times in 1997 and slumped again last season, needing 
a strong September to end up at .240 with 26 homers and 67 RBIs. In 
382 games with the Cardinals during three seasons, he fanned 352 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was whiff, whiff, whiff,'' La Russa said. ``I really hope  
he goes to Philly and whiffs for them like he whiffed for us, and 
we'll see what excuse he makes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After several days of major trades (Roger Clemens) and  
season-ending illnesses (Andres Galarraga) and injuries (Moises 
Alou), it was a relatively quiet day around the camps. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest ruckus was in Tampa, Fla., where Jose Canseco failed  
to show on the voluntary reporting date. The mandatory date isn't 
until March 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, it's irritating a little bit because he's such a big cog  
of the wheel,'' general manager Chuck LaMar said. ``Jose's going to 
show up when Jose's ready. And I guess that's what bothers me the 
most. If it was injury or visa problems or personal problems or 
irritation over a contract or a trade that just materialized, then 
that's one thing. But just to premeditatively not show up for a 
couple of days -- if that's the case -- is a different story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Melbourne, Fla., the Florida Marlins found out rookie third  
baseman Mike Lowell will undergo a short course of radiation for 
treatment of testicular cancer. Lowell, acquired during the 
offseason from the New York Yankees, is expected to join the team 
later this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Pathology reports indicate that Lowell's chance of recovery is  
excellent, team physician Dr. Dan Kanell said. The cancer didn't 
spread beyond a testicle removed in outpatient surgery Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel optimistic and have a positive attitude,'' Lowell said  
in a statement. ``Everything is pointing in the right direction. My 
faith, family and friends have been the key ingredients in this 
battle. We are a formidable army, and the cancer didn't have a 
chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Fort Myers, the focus was on Boston shortstop Nomar  
Garciaparra, the undisputed team star following the departure of Mo 
Vaughn to Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anybody can take Mo's spot,'' Garciaparra said.  
``Everybody has the same personality they had. Nobody's going to 
change. There's no need to change and you come out here, you 
prepare yourself for the season and you take on the season like any 
other year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Port St. Lucie, Rickey Henderson and Bobby Bonilla reported  
early. Henderson, 40, was known for showing up after the voluntary 
reporting date in his younger days, which infuriated the Oakland 
Athletics more than once. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think most people during my years have always said Rickey  
comes to spring training late,'' Henderson said. ``But we were 
always scheduled a week in advance for the guys to come back from 
the East Coast, who had the bad weather, to give them a chance to 
get a head start. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was always in California and always came to camp in tip-top  
shape. The week wasn't going to do anything for me. The press was 
always going to blow it out. I was always there; they never had to 
find me.''

<HEADLINE> Doctor Held in Hospital Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	METHUEN, Mass. (AP) -- A doctor visiting his estranged wife at a  
hospital shot and killed another man in her hospital room Tuesday 
night, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctor was arrested shortly after the shooting at Holy  
Family Hospital. A revolver was recovered at the scene, Essex 
County District Attorney Kevin Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. James Kartell, 59, was separated from his wife and had gone  
to visit her at the hospital, where she was a patient, police Lt. 
Michael Hatem said. 
</P>
<P>
	The man already visiting her was apparently the woman's new  
boyfriend, authorities said. When Kartell arrived, the two men 
argued, and the doctor apparently shot the man. 
</P>
<P>
	Kartell was being treated Tuesday night for minor injuries at  
the hospital, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was set to be arraigned in Lawrence District Court on  
Wednesday morning for murder, if he is well enough to appear, Burke 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital spokeswoman Lauren Carney said the doctor is a plastic  
surgeon who has privileges allowing him to treat patients at Holy 
Family.

<HEADLINE> Unilever Profit Grows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Unilever's profit surged in the fourth quarter  
despite lower sales and flagging demand in Asia and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Anglo-Dutch consumer goods conglomerate earned 453 million  
pounds, or $735 million, in the last three months of 1998 compared 
to 167 million pounds in the same period of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Its operating profit from continuing operations rose 17 percent  
to 725 million, or $1.18 billion. Its products include Vaseline 
skin care ointments, Liton tea and Dove soap. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were in line with analysts' expectations. Unilever's  
share price in London slipped 0.2 percent in London trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterly revenues fell 2 percent to 7.14 billion pounds, or  
$11.59 billion, due partly to the continuing effects of the 
financial crises in Indonesia, Russia and other emerging markets. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year 1998, net profit rose 45 percent to 2.10 billion  
pounds, or $3.41 billion. Much of the improvement stemmed from 
stronger food sales in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the year fell 2 percent to 29.04 billion pounds, or  
$47.13 billion, due to the absence of results for the chemicals 
business that Unilever sold off in July 1997. Excluding chemicals, 
1998 revenues actually grew by 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Annual revenues fell by 4 percent in Europe, where unseasonably  
poor summer weather depressed sales of ice cream. Strong results in 
India, which accounts for 30 percent of Unilever's sales in Asia, 
helped offset losses in China and the effects of currency 
devaluations elewhere in that region. 
</P>
<P>
	Company sales were generally stronger in the first half of 1998,  
with financial crises in several markets biting deeper in later 
months, said chairman Niall FitzGerald. 
</P>
<P>
	Personal care goods like deodorants and oral hygiene products  
were among Unilever's strongest performers, FitzGerald said.

<HEADLINE> Pa. Sees Unusual Underwear Ad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEWISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- As cars speed up Route 15 at 55 mph, the  
billboard zooms past: sexy pose, woman wearing underwear -- another 
racy Victoria's Secret ad? Nope. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a 67-year-old woman in a girdle, proudly showing off her  
age spots and love handles. Call it art. 
</P>
<P>
	Bucknell University is exhibiting a photograph that 32-year-old  
London resident Melanie Manchot shot of her mother, Margaret. But 
it's not hanging in a gallery, where only a few art lovers would 
see it. Instead, the artwork poses as advertising and looms over a 
highway -- where every commuter, shopper and tourist can take a 
fleeting peek. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an unexpected encounter,'' explained Mark Segal, 38, who  
helped with the project. 
</P>
<P>
	He's not kidding. Here is an older woman who would never make it  
as a Sports Illustrated swimsuit model or a Times Square waif. 
She's clearly proud. Her hands rest behind her head. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at you loving me,'' reads the red-lettered slogan.  
</P>
<P>
	``She's an empowered person. She's not going to rise and fall on  
whether she looks good in underwear,'' says Stuart Horodner, 
director of Bucknell Art Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Manchot chose her mother because she wanted to photograph  
someone who was not the typical model. Together, they have compiled 
a series of mostly nude photographs, 60 in all. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I wanted to do was work with someone who had fallen out  
of that group -- simply because they were older,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone agrees with the display.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a conservative person, so I probably won't like it,'' said  
JoAnne Campbell of Unityville, walking outside a nearby craft store 
to take a look. ``Oh, I think that's unnecessary. We don't need 
things like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't consider it art,'' added Lorie Cero of Turbotville.  
</P>
<P>
	But the empowerment Margaret Manchot shows off touched some in  
this mostly conservative town of 5,500 people.

<HEADLINE> SEC Head Urges Over Mutual Fund / Mutual Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent directors of fund companies must  
help the government protect the millions of Americans who invest in 
mutual funds, top securities regulators say. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside directors of mutual fund companies must act as a ``force  
for accountability'' on behalf of ordinary investors, who depend on 
their independence to maintain funds' integrity, said Arthur 
Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mutual fund industry, for the most part, has been  
responsive to our concerns,'' Levitt said Tuesday at the start of a 
two-day conference on the role of independent mutual fund 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he added, at a time when more people than ever are  
investing in funds, cosmetic fixes or a ``lukewarm effort at best 
practices'' by the industry are not sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 66 million people now invest in mutual funds, whose  
total assets exceeded $5.5 trillion at the end of last year, up 
from around $1 trillion in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt has been pushing the industry for improved disclosure of  
mutual fees and investment risks. 
</P>
<P>
	``While (mutual) fund performance is unpredictable, the impact  
of fees is not,'' he said Tuesday, noting that a 1 percent annual 
fee will reduce an investor's final account balance by 17 percent 
over 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Roye, the SEC's top mutual fund regulator, said independent  
directors have played an important role in keeping the industry 
remarkably free from scandals. 
</P>
<P>
	But directors and regulators ``must remain on guard and continue  
to challenge, probe and ask the difficult questions,'' Roye told 
conference participants, who included mutual fund executives, 
outside directors, investor advocates and academics. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the SEC will ``aggressively and vigorously pursue''  
reports of legal violations brought to it by independent directors 
of mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Roye did not specifically mention any avenues that the SEC might  
take, but it was clear he referred to the agency's power to bring 
civil lawsuits against mutual fund company officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Scott, an independent director of American Century Funds  
and Dresdner RCM Capital Funds, said the SEC would be taking the 
wrong approach by bringing more suits against mutual fund 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew Fink, president of the Investment Company Institute, the  
industry's trade group, said in a statement mutual funds ``have the 
strongest system of corporate governance'' in the country's private 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is always important to guard against complacency,'' Fink  
said. He said the conference, which was organized by the SEC, 
provides an opportunity to consider ways of making ``this strong 
system of oversight even more effective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt said he hoped the conference would help find solutions to  
improve the way mutual fund companies are run. 
</P>
<P>
	John Markese, president of the American Association of  
Individual Investors, suggested ordinary shareholders in mutual 
funds be given a vote in choosing outside directors, who now are 
selected by the companies themselves.

<HEADLINE> Columbia/HCA Unsure About Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Columbia/HCA Healthcare is sending mixed signals  
to investors on when the government's long-running billing fraud 
probe will end. 
</P>
<P>
	The company on Tuesday disclosed it had given the U.S. Justice  
Department a $1 billion letter of credit. The letter showed the 
company has access to that amount of money in case the government 
asked for it as part of any settlement agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	That disclosure as well as the Justice Department's announcement  
last month that it was in settlement talks with Columbia have led 
some investors to believe a deal is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	But Columbia said the $1 billion figure was not specifically  
related to how much it may pay as part of the fine-- the figure 
could be higher or lower. And Columbia officials said they could 
not predict when a potential settlement would occur. 
</P>
<P>
	In a move that may delay any settlement, a federal court  
administrative committee on Monday denied a Justice Department 
request to consolidate a number of lawsuits filed against Columbia 
by whistle-blowers. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia has also recently completed a $1 billion stock buyback  
and announced plans Tuesday to buy back $1 billion more. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia listed a number of reasons beyond the fraud probe for  
its weak performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them were cuts in federal reimbursements for Medicare  
patients, higher medical costs, particularly for drugs, fewer 
admissions, due in part to the mild flu season and problems 
collecting payments from insurers. 
</P>
<P>
	For more than 18 months, the federal government and at least 11  
states have been looking into whether Columbia committed fraud by 
overcharging Medicare and other government health programs. Four 
Columbia middle managers have been indicted in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	After the investigation began, Columbia cut short an aggressive  
hospital acquisition program and began a major downsizing. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia sold 14 hospitals during the fourth quarter, leaving it  
with 305 hospitals nationwide, down from 336 a year ago. It expects 
to have about 217 hospitals after completing plans to sell or spin 
off hospitals to two separate companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to the investigation, Columbia owned 345 hospitals.  
</P>
<P>
	Separately Tuesday, Columbia released its fourth-quarter  
earnings, badly missing analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia lost $42 million, or 6 cents a share in the quarter,  
well below the loss of $1.2 billion, or $1.92 per share, in the 
fourth quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if expenses related to the probe and other restructuring  
efforts are excluded, the company's profits from continuing 
operations missed Wall Street predictions badly. 
</P>
<P>
	Profits from continuing operations, which are based on the  
company's regular businesses, were $27 million, or 4 cents per 
share. Analysts had expected profits from operations of 23 cents 
per share, according to survey by the research firm First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia's fourth-quarter revenue was up slightly, from $4.37  
billion to $4.42 billion. But admissions to facilities open at 
least one year -- a key measure of the company's vitality -- were off 
1 percent.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Europe Boycott Drug Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YANGON, Myanmar (AP) -- The United States and European countries  
were rebuked Tuesday for passing up an international heroin 
conference because it was in Myanmar, one of the world's biggest 
producers of the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants at the 4th International Heroin Conference said the  
boycott by the world's biggest heroin consuming nations ran counter 
to the spirit of international cooperation against drug 
trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
	``As two of the largest markets for heroin in the world, the  
United States and Britain bear a special responsibility to work 
with the rest of the international community in every way 
possible,'' Home Affairs Minister Col. Tin Hlaing said in his 
opening address. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-day conference was organized by Interpol, the Lyon,  
France-based agency that bolsters links among national police 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Other countries boycotting the conference include France,  
Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway. Representatives of 26 other 
countries, including Australia and Switzerland, were listed as 
attending. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington and other critics say the military regime in Myanmar,  
also known as Burma, has failed to seriously crack down on drugs 
and has such a poor human rights record that it does not deserve 
the legitimacy conferred by the conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States believes that the Burmese regime could use  
the conference to create the false impression of international 
approval, both by Interpol and by participating countries, for its 
counternarcotics and anti-crime performance,'' U.S. State 
Department spokesman James Foley said Tuesday in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``Burma's counternarcotics efforts, while improving, are far  
from what is necessary. And Burma, of course, persists in its 
disregard for political and human rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based Human Rights Watch likened holding the  
meeting in Yangon to ``holding a convention on weapons of mass 
destruction in Baghdad, on women's rights in Kabul or on terrorism 
in Tripoli.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Myanmar officials are especially sensitive to criticism on the  
drug issue because they feel they have made great achievements in 
the fight against drugs -- especially measured by the number of 
seizures -- with almost no outside aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Most foreign aid to the country was cut off a decade ago  
following the bloody suppression of protests against military rule.

<HEADLINE> O'Meara Knows About Match Play  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- Mark O'Meara was taking inventory of  
what it will take to win the Match Play Championship. He sounded 
very much like he was describing himself, even if that wasn't his 
intention. 
</P>
<P>
	``Experience, wisdom, a little bit of patience,'' he said on the  
driving range at La Costa Resort on Monday. ``And you can't get too 
rattled if you get off to a bad start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At age 41 and coming off the best year of his life, O'Meara has  
all of those traits. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited the experience being in the hunt so many times in a  
major championship as one reason he won the Masters. He relied on 
wisdom and patience to pull off the major double in July, winning 
the British Open in a playoff over Brian Watts. 
</P>
<P>
	And O'Meara knows a thing or two about getting off to a bad  
start, particularly in match play. Just four months ago, he fell 
behind Tiger Woods in the final of the World Match Play 
Championship in England before rallying on the final nine holes, 
winning 1-up with a birdie putt from the fringe on the 36th hole. 
</P>
<P>
	But O'Meara believe he has something even better in his corner  
this week. While just about everyone else was tuning up in Los 
Angeles for the first $5 million World Golf Championship event of 
the year, O'Meara was on the slopes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like all the guys who go skiing play well the next  
week,'' he said, referring to David Duval returning from a week 
skiing in Idaho and winning the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic with a 59 
in the final round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to play well this week.''  
</P>
<P>
	Once again, O'Meara seems to be a forgotten star this week. He  
proved a year ago that golf knows no age limit, becoming the oldest 
player to win two majors in a year. He won the Masters, but no one 
talked about a Grand Slam. He won the British Open, yet few people 
seriously thought he would be a factor in the PGA Championship. He 
tied for fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first official match-play event since Tucson in 1985,  
most of the attention is on Tiger Woods, the only player who win 
three straight U.S. Amateurs, and Ernie Els, a three-time winner of 
the World Match Play Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Never mind that O'Meara is also a former U.S. Amateur champion.  
Is his dramatic victory over Woods in the World Match Play already 
forgotten? 
</P>
<P>
	And if the good vibes that come with having had success at a  
particular course counts for anything, there's another reason not 
to count out O'Meara. He won the Mercedes Championship at La Costa 
three years ago, finished a stroke behind Phil Mickelson last year 
and has one other runner-up finish. 
</P>
<P>
	But all the wisdom and all the experience has taught O'Meara one  
thing about match play -- it's anybody's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods, ranked No. 1 in the world, has to take on three-time  
Masters and British Open champion Nick Faldo in the opening round. 
Els, coming off a victory last week in the Nissan Open, plays Paul 
Azinger, a Ryder Cup stalwart who approaches match play like a game 
of five-card stud. 
</P>
<P>
	Colin Montgomerie won the last Andersen Consulting World  
Championship of Golf -- on American soil, no less -- but has to first 
get through Craig Stadler, who grew up in the San Diego and has a 
history of doing well at La Costa. PGA champion Vijay Singh has to 
play Rocco Mediate, who outdueled Woods to win in Phoenix last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this field, you can't take anyone for granted,'' O'Meara  
said. ``You need to know, you're talking about the top 64 players 
in the world. It's not like No. 3 versus No. 300. The top 70 or 80 
are really world-class players. They can beat any player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Match Play Championship isn't a major, but no other  
tournament -- especially one in its first year of existence -- has 
generated this much excitement. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne Stewart, who won the rain-shortened Pebble Beach National  
Pro-Am two weeks ago, was already talking about the amount of 
gamesmanship that will go into the matches. Azinger says just about 
every shot he hits will depend on what Els is doing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's dog-eat-dog, every round,'' said Nick Price, who plays  
the first match of the tournament Wednesday morning against Frankie 
Minoza. ``It's going to be a survival.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And it's going to take some experience, wisdom and patience --  
all of which has served O'Meara well.

<HEADLINE> La Costa To Feature Match Play  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- Tennis players usually don't stand a  
chance in an opening-round match against the world's No. 1 player. 
</P>
<P>
	But this is golf, which means that while Pete Sampras and No. 64  
Jiri Novak are nowhere to be seen, Tiger Woods might well have his 
hands full with Nick Faldo in the opening round of the Match Play 
Championship at La Costa Resort. 
</P>
<P>
	The Woods-Faldo match helps inaugurate both a new tournament and  
a new order of world golf in the first of three $5 million events 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the last putt is sunk in today's opening round  
matches, half of the world's top 64 golfers will have been 
eliminated. And no less an observer than Greg Norman says it's very 
possible the casualties could include Woods, the top player in the 
field, who plays the 64th-ranked Faldo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes the underdog finds that little extra inside him,''  
Norman said. ``Somebody like Nick, knowing Nick's mentality and how 
strong his head is, he has found ways to win golf tournaments. And 
I wouldn't be at all surprised if he can find a way to win this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods, the top seed because of his position atop the world golf  
rankings, plays Faldo in one of the premier matches of the day as 
match play returns to the PGA Tour in the most talked about new 
tournament in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the lone player in the field who survives six matches  
-- the final one stretching up to 36 holes -- will walk away with a 
$1 million first prize. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's dog-eat-dog, every round,'' said Nick Price, who plays  
the first match of the tournament against Frankie Minoza. ``It's 
going to be a survival.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The drama of match play and the magnitude of the field has done  
what didn't seem possible before -- turn a February tournament into 
an event that has attracted attention rivaling a PGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a lot of excitement in the air, a lot of buzz in the  
air,'' said Mark O'Meara, whose No. 3 ranking got him an opening 
match against Michael Bradley. ``There is going to be some great 
matches and there is going to be some upsets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods and David Duval, the No. 2 seed, are obvious favorites in  
the $5 million tournament that is the first creation in a series of 
three tournaments put together by golf's five world governing 
bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	But any player who gets on a birdie binge for a few holes is  
capable of an upset -- although it seems unlikely that Duval faces 
that kind of a threat from Australia's Stephen Leaney, his 
first-round opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The No. 1 seed, or basically any seed here, is kind of thrown  
out the door because the top 64 players are capable of beating each 
other on any given day,'' Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods, coming off a win just down the coast at Torrey Pines two  
weeks ago and a second-place finish at the Nissan Open last 
weekend, brings a potential to overpower a La Costa course playing 
much faster than previous years when it hosted the season-opening 
Mercedes Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	He also brings a pretty impressive history in match play --  
including three straight U.S. Amateur championships before turning 
pro. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to have to make a lot of birdies,'' said Woods,  
whose most recent match play win came against Norman in the 
President's Cup in December. ``It is a different type of format 
where pars here are just not going to get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Faldo, on the other hand, is in the worst slump of his career,  
having not won in two years. The player who was once No. 1 in the 
world for 81 straight weeks has gone to a new instructor in search 
of a swing that can bring him back into contention. 
</P>
<P>
	Faldo, though, is an expert at match play, having won more Ryder  
Cup matches than any golfer in the world. Two of his 39 victories 
around the world came in England's World Match Play Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good opportunity,'' Faldo said.  
</P>
<P>
	The first day of play features some intriguing matches, and one  
of the best might be Ernie Els against Paul Azinger. Tom Watson 
faces Bob Tway, while Vijay Singh opens against Rocco Mediate, 
winner of the Phoenix Open last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The winners advance to a second round Thursday, which will  
narrow the field to 16 players, and the winners of those matches 
Friday morning will have to play again in the afternoon to get to 
Saturday's semifinal matches. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's final is scheduled for 36 holes, with the winner  
picking up $1 million and the loser pocketing $500,000. The two 
semifinal losers play a consolation match, with $400,000 to the 
winner and $300,000 to the loser. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not what I'm here for,'' England's Lee Westwood said of  
the huge purse. ``But it is always handy.''

<HEADLINE> Rodman Signs With Lakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- It's official -- The Worm is a Laker.  
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Rodman, the NBA's dominant rebounder of the '90s, signed  
a one-year contract with the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday, and 
will participate in a limited practice session Wednesday, team 
spokesman John Black said. 
</P>
<P>
	The way things have gone recently, the slumping Lakers need all  
the help they can get. 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to Rodman said the eccentric forward spent much  
of Tuesday doing post-production services on the movie ``Simon 
Sez,'' to be released later this year, but took a break to sign the 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Following Wednesday's practice, the source said, Rodman will  
attend the Grammy Awards with his wife, actress Carmen Electra. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers waited to execute the contract until after a 93-83  
loss at Vancouver on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, who will take a physical examination before Wednesday's  
practice, will replace rookie Ruben Patterson on the Lakers' 
roster. Patterson was placed on the injured list because of 
tendinitis in his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Because they're over the salary cap, the Lakers can only pay  
Rodman the veterans' minimum of $1 million, pro-rated to under 
$500,000 because of the shortened season plus the games he's 
missed. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, who has led the NBA in rebounding in each of the last  
seven seasons, will be one of several Lakers taking part in 
Wednesday's practice, which comes on the heels of a three-game, 
three-day road trip -- all of which were losses to drop them to 6-6. 
</P>
<P>
	Black said Rodman will be available to the media afterward, and  
probably play his first game for the Lakers on Friday night against 
the Los Angeles Clippers at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	Black said Rodman, who turns 38 in May, could make his Lakers'  
debut as early as Thursday night against the Clippers in Anaheim, 
or as late as Sunday against Houston at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	Also among those expected to take part in Wednesday's practice  
is forward Robert Horry, who was cleared to play Tuesday. Horry 
missed seven games after being diagnosed with an irregular 
heartbeat prior to a 101-99 loss to Indiana on Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, former Lakers point guard Nick Van Exel believes his  
former team could be making a mistake by adding Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Van Exel, who was traded to the Denver Nuggets on  
draft day last summer after five controversial seasons with the 
Lakers, might not be the most objective observer. 
</P>
<P>
	``He (Lakers coach Del Harris) thought I was a problem? I want  
to see Dennis go over there personally,'' Van Exel said after 
helping the Nuggets beat the Lakers 117-113 in overtime Monday 
night in Denver for only their second victory of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to see how Del handles it. ... My honest opinion is it  
depends on Dennis Rodman's attitude,'' Van Exel said. ``If he comes 
in with his great rebounding, the intensity he always brings to the 
game, he's going to be great for that team. If he come in with all 
his antics and just thinking about Dennis Rodman the show, he's 
going to kill that team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A member of five championship teams, including the last three  
with the Chicago Bulls, Rodman announced during a rambling 
20-minute news conference Monday he intended to play for the Lakers 
and would be in uniform later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to get some rebounds -- he's going to be a big  
help,'' Lakers star Shaquille O'Neal said after the loss at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman's announcement during a bizarre press conference met with  
mixed reaction among fans. 
</P>
<P>
	XTRA Radio in San Diego's afternoon show kept count among  
callers and the totals were 34 in favor of Rodman's addition to the 
Lakers and 28 against. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the comments:  
</P>
<P>
	-- ``Let's get the player now and then get his (former) coach  
(Phil Jackson) next.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``Cross off the cross-dresser from this list.''  
</P>
<P>
	-- ``Have not won, will not win with Del Harris. Get Rodman.''  
</P>
<P>
	Van Exel, who had a stormy relationship with Harris, said he  
wasn't the problem with the Lakers -- his coach was. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Nuggets rallied from a 12-point fourth quarter deficit  
to beat the Lakers, Van Exel said, ``I wasn't the cancer. The 
cancer is still there. He has white hair. And until they get rid of 
him, they're going to keep having lapses like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reference was obviously to Harris.

	``I was loving it,'' said Van Exel, who scored seven of his 16  
points in overtime and had 13 assists. ``It was exciting, beating 
Del, beating their management. There was a lot of revenge in this

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rejects China Satellite Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After years of promoting satellite exports to  
China, the Clinton administration abruptly reversed course, 
rejecting a $450 million commercial satellite sale to a 
Chinese-controlled consortium amid concerns about valuable military 
know-how. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision, confirmed Tuesday by senior administration  
officials, leaves Hughes Electronics with tens of millions of 
dollars in high-tech hardware under construction at its Southern 
California plant. Rejection of the export comes a week before 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright travels to Beijing for talks 
with Chinese leaders and amid congressional and executive branch 
probes of whether past satellite deals helped the Chinese military. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes, which employs 15,000 people in the Los Angeles area,  
said it would appeal the decision. But U.S. officials said they saw 
little or no chance that the national security agencies that 
opposed the deal would reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
	The key issue, the official said, was that as the proposed sale  
progressed, the consortium took on more Chinese investors with 
direct ties to the Chinese military. The Clinton administration 
emphasized this change in explaining why it was rejecting an export 
that President Clinton had initially approved in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is final as far as the U.S. government decision-making  
process is concerned,'' State Department spokesman James Foley said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The buyer is the Singapore-based Asia Pacific Mobile  
Telecommunications consortium, a cellular phone venture that 
includes investors from Singapore, Malaysia and Japan but is 
51-percent owned by Chinese organizations -- several of them 
represented by Chinese military officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Commerce Department was actively backing the export,  
arguing it would strengthen U.S. national security by improving the 
financial position of Hughes, a company that makes military and 
espionage satellites for the Pentagon and CIA. 
</P>
<P>
	``These companies cannot survive on what business they're  
getting from the Defense Department,'' said a senior Commerce 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said U.S. 
manufacturers could face difficulties in the worldwide market for 
commercial communications satellites if they cannot get licenses or 
if other countries perceive the companies will face trouble getting 
licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon and State Department opposed the sale out of  
concern that the Chinese military might gain know-how from Hughes' 
sophisticated satellite and ground station technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department also was on the verge of rejecting a  
separate license required for the Hughes satellite to be launched 
into space atop a Chinese rocket. Here the key concern was that 
U.S. technical assistance needed to put the satellite into a 
precise orbit might help the Chinese improve their ballistic 
missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Defense Department had some serious national security  
concerns about this particular transaction,'' said Pentagon 
spokesman Kenneth Bacon. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes spokesman Richard Dore downplayed the impact of the  
export license rejection. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure what it bodes for Hughes. China is a market, but  
it's not the dominant market for us,'' Dore said. ``We have in 
excess of $4 billion in backlogs on our spacecraft today. The 
bigger issue is what it might mean for the industry as a whole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes could be liable to the consortium for up to $100 million  
in potential penalties, according to Clayton Mowry of the Satellite 
Industry Association, though he said Hughes' overall financial 
health was strong. Hughes shares did not appear to be severely 
affected by news of the export license rejection. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration insists it continues to support  
satellite exports to China. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision does not mean in any way that we've changed our  
policy,'' Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the senior Commerce official said the Asia Pacific satellite  
export ``could have been used as a model'' for the U.S. government 
to approve satellite exports to China with appropriate safeguards 
to protect sensitive technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next five years, 14 Chinese rockets have been reserved  
to launch U.S.-made satellites, and most of those deals already 
have the necessary U.S. approvals, according to Mowry. But he said 
the long-term impact of the Clinton administration decision could 
be damaging to a U.S. commercial satellite industry that now 
controls 75 percent of the world market and is responsible for 
100,000 high-paying jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to kill the golden goose,'' Mowry said. ``You're  
creating a situation where the perception is you can't get a 
license or it's very difficult to get a license.''

<HEADLINE> Moviegoers Ignore 'Thin Red Line' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Disappointing the movie studio and  
confounding analysts, the World War II epic ``The Thin Red Line'' 
saw its business plummet after earning seven Academy Award 
nominations. 
</P>
<P>
	The other best picture nominees, ``Saving Private Ryan'' (in  
re-release), ``Elizabeth,'' ``Shakespeare in Love'' and ``Life Is 
Beautiful,'' all got post-nomination bounces, as did last year's 
``Titanic,'' ``L.A. Confidential,'' ``Good Will Hunting,'' ``As 
Good As It Gets'' and ``The Full Monty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But ``The Thin Red Line,'' which opened on Christmas Day in  
limited release and was expanded to wide release on Jan. 15, 
actually lost 2.4 percent of its business the weekend after the 
Oscar nominations were announced Feb. 9 and another 50 percent last 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Produced for about $52 million, the film has now grossed $34.4  
million in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's any question that it was a  
disappointment that it didn't do better with a (nomination) bump,'' 
said Tom Sherak, chairman of 20th Century Fox Domestic Film Group. 
``I have a feeling that because of the kind of movie it was -- more 
of an art movie that went really wide -- the people who had wanted 
to see it went to see it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Directed by Terrence Malick, who returned to filmmaking after a  
two-decade absence, ``The Thin Red Line'' received mostly glowing 
reviews for its poetic, visually stunning story of the battle of 
Guadalcanal, though some critics found its plot convoluted, the 
characters underdeveloped and the voiceovers confusing. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie also ran more than three hours.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's fascinating that this film has just died,'' said box  
office analyst Robert Bucksbaum of Reel Source Inc. ``I just don't 
understand why the film isn't catching on. Are people just 
comparing it to `Saving Private Ryan.' Is it just too `out there?' 
Is Fox not marketing it right?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reclusive Malick doesn't do media interviews. But one of the  
film's producers, Mike Medavoy, said there was still time for ``The 
Thin Red Line'' to at least break even, and it has strong prospects 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he believed the movie also will be appreciated  
artistically long after people stop tallying the box office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want as many people to share this movie as there exists  
people in the world,'' he said.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans ``can justifiably feel proud'' of

	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp., the U.S. steel industry's

about 18 million metric tons of steel to its plants around the 
world. The deals with about 40 global steelmakers are worth $11.7 
billion. Today's announcement marks a major shift for the world's 
largest automaker, which last year embarked on a new global bidding 
process for its steel purchases. GM previously bought its steel 
region by region, generally in one- or two-year contracts. GM 
shares were at 85 9/16, down 1 15/16.

CBS and Fox because it will beam down the network programs in a way 
it contends doesn't violate a federal court order. The company 
believes it can legally offer the CBS and Fox affiliates because 
the court order with the Sunday deadline applies only to DirecTV's

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a major policy reversal, the Clinton

<HEADLINE> Conn. College Perfect in Div. III </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) -- Six years ago, the men's basketball  
program at Connecticut College was the cellar dweller of the New 
England Small College Athletic Conference and on the verge of being 
temporarily shelved. 
</P>
<P>
	The program found a turnaround guy in Glen Miller, who knew a  
thing or two about rebuilding. He played under Jim Calhoun at 
Northeastern and was part of the original coaching staff when 
Calhoun took over in 1986 at Connecticut, a program languishing 
near the bottom of the Big East. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut (24-2) has since become a national powerhouse and  
held the No. 1 ranking for 10 weeks this year, before falling to 
No. 4 this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller's Camels are having the best season on record and at 22-0  
are No. 1 in Division III with two games left. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said he and Calhoun have a ``great relationship'' and  
talk often. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to think I'd still have the same work ethic and drive  
to be successful if I'd never associated with him,'' Miller said 
Tuesday. ``But certainly he has those qualities. He has a real will 
and determination to get the most out of practice every day and to 
improve his team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So, too, has Miller, according to his players.  
</P>
<P>
	``He expects the absolute best. Nothing less, '' senior  
co-captain Dwayne Stallings said. ``Even if we win, it's not 
satisfying unless you play well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Camels have played increasing well in each of Miller's six  
years at the private, liberal arts school. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, 37, has taken the Camels from a 6-18 record in 1993-94  
to 22-4 last year. The team advanced to the round of 16 in the NCAA 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The turnaround didn't surprise Calhoun.  
</P>
<P>
	``He (Miller) fell in love with coaching,'' Calhoun said. ``He  
has a no-nonsense work ethic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are similarities in their game plans, as well. Both teams  
thrive on full-court pressure, man-to-man defense and a speedy 
transition game. 
</P>
<P>
	Building a winner meant upgrading the recruiting program.  
Miller, who grew up in neighboring Groton, inherited a program with 
just two recruited players. He started prospecting for talent right 
outside his office at Luce Fieldhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I used to sit here and look out the window and anybody that  
walked down the stairs and looked like they had any athletic 
ability I'd meet them at the front door and asked them if they play 
basketball or if they were interested,'' Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	He struck gold in his own backyard. Stallings, a 6-3 guard from  
New London, is the team scoring leader and 3-point specialist with 
a 43 percent average from beyond the arc. He's averaging 14.8 
points a game and has 147 3-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
	The last four years have been a ride to remember, said  
Stallings, who chose Connecticut College for its academics and has 
a job with a business firm waiting for him upon graduation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm having a great time. I just wish I could come back for  
another four years. It's gone by too fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller has been much of the reason, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's fun, he's energetic, he really, really loves to win and  
he loves the game. So do I,'' Stallings said. ``I think we work out 
well when it comes to winning and losing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said he and Calhoun keep an eye on each other's programs.  
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, he watched the Huskies lose to Miami and knew to  
wait a couple days before phoning his old boss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't make it a habit of calling after they lose,'' Miller  
said. ``I give that a few days or at least until they get another 
win. I've slept in the office up there a couple times after losses. 
He's not a fun person to be around when he loses.''

in the new world of golf that might not be taking place without him 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	After spending 40 minutes in the fitness trailer -- part of his  
routine now to loosen his surgically repaired left shoulder -- 
Norman breezed through the media center and glanced for the first 
time at the brackets for the Match Play Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just glad I could make the field,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Behind that crooked, daring smile, Norman must have realized  
there might not be a field -- at least not this soon -- if he were 
just another rank-and-file player on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he ruffled the feathers of Tim Finchem, the unflappable  
PGA Tour commissioner, by proposing a world tour in November 1994 
that would bring together the top 40 players in the world eight 
times a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you needed to put a cat amongst the pigeons to flush  
out what needed to be flushed out,'' he said Tuesday, looking back 
more with pride than vindication. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Norman's proposal crashed and burned like so many of  
his final rounds in major championships. Finchem forced players to 
choose between the PGA Tour and the World Tour, threatening to 
enforce the ``conflicting events'' rule that requires permission to 
play in outside events. 
</P>
<P>
	And with shocking suddenness, players abandoned Norman's dream.  
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, an International Federation of PGA Tours headed  
by Finchem announced the creation of the World Golf Championships, 
ultimately four events worth $5 million each that would pull 
together the best players on the planet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is what Greg Norman was hoping for,'' said Mark  
O'Meara. ``Greg has done so much for the game. The ideas he had for 
a world tour. I know he was criticized for them, but everyone wants 
to see the best players in the world competing each other, and 
that's what we have this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norman and Finchem have since made peace. Norman said he was  
willing to let Finchem take the idea and run with it, curious to 
see where it might lead. Finchem is willing to concede Norman's 
influence on the finished project. 
</P>
<P>
	``Greg's effort, his biggest impact on this, was to focus  
attention on the need to align the sport more in the direction of 
international play,'' Finchem said. ``We had already formed a 
federation at that point. We had begun a dialogue. His initiative 
helped to focus on the possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've given Greg a lot of credit,'' he said. ``Without his  
initiative, we wouldn't have been as focused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finchem stopped short of saying that the first World Golf  
Championship event would have been a few years away without Norman. 
Even Norman was unsure whether the Match Play Championship would 
have taken place this week without him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to say,'' he said, pausing to contemplate the past.  
``Probably not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norman's success on the golf course is always subject to debate.  
He has lost majors more often than most players even get into 
contention, eight times a runner-up and the only man to lose all 
four majors in a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the ropes, just about everything he puts his hands on  
turns to gold -- a growing golf course design entity, his own brand 
of turf, a sharp clothing line with one of the most recognizable 
logos in golf. 
</P>
<P>
	But his plan for a World Tour never had much of a chance, and  
perhaps that's good. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 64 players in the world are gathered this week with $1  
million going to the survivor and $25,000 for those who will 
arrange flights home after the first round Wednesday. Norman's plan 
would have allowed only the top 30 to play, with 10 special 
exemptions. 
</P>
<P>
	And he never considered match play, which is more responsible  
for the hype this week than the record amount of official money at 
stake. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman didn't want his events to count as official money. He  
also proposed eight world events, not four. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he saw a semblance of what he was trying to accomplish  
when he walked across the practice range. There was Colin 
Montgomerie, Lee Westwood and Jose Maria Olazabal from Europe; 
Craig Parry from Australia and Shigeki Maruyama from Japan; and 
Ernie Els, who usually waits until March to come to America. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall,'' he said, ``it wasn't such a bad idea.''

<HEADLINE> Vaughn Says Angels Respected Him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Mo Vaughn said the Anaheim Angels showed him  
the respect lacking in Boston, so that's why he is no longer with 
the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn reported with the position players for the Angels' first  
full-squad workout Tuesday, and he answered the inevitable 
questions concerning his breakup with Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why he is no longer with the Red Sox after eight seasons,  
Vaughn said, ``I think it's all on two guys -- the general manager 
and owner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was speaking about Dan Duquette and John Harrington,  
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	``We as players said our piece,'' Vaughn said. ``We've made our  
statements. What has been said has come true. It's for everybody in 
the media to see. It's definitely in the big headlights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn was referring to Boston's inability to build and maintain  
a winning organization, at least from his point of view. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the trade of former Red Sox ace Roger Clemens to the  
arch-rival New York Yankees was ``definitely a problem for 
Boston.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox did not contact him during a 15-day period after the  
season, Vaughn claims. In that time, Anaheim called and made an 
offer worth $80 million over six years. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the deal he signed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell I was not wanted there in Boston,'' he said. ``The  
Angels came first after me, and they came with respect. You want an 
organization that wants you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he will miss the Red Sox fans the most. He wants to  
return to Fenway Park for the All-Star Game this year, not for 
vengeance, but for a chance ``to sleep in my own bed, so to 
speak.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The fans were always great to me there,'' he said. ``The thing  
is, I've been in the All-Star Game the last three or four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just so happens it's in Fenway Park this year. I won't be  
carrying a grudge when I play there. I'm a happy person.''

<HEADLINE> Weather Allows New Cotton Farming / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- Thanks to El Nino, 1998 was one of the  
most forgettable seasons for California cotton growers. 
</P>
<P>
	This year might be unforgettable, with farmers allowed to plant  
any variety of cotton for the first time in more than seven 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	It was in 1925 when an industry group asked legislators in  
Sacramento to write a law that would allow growers to plant only 
the high-quality acala variety. 
</P>
<P>
	California remained a one-variety state until 1991 when it added  
pimas, which are even higher quality than acalas. 
</P>
<P>
	But last year's wet winter and cool spring meant growers weren't  
able to plant on schedule, forcing them to ask for a reprieve from 
then-Gov. Pete Wilson. The governor issued a temporary order 
allowing farmers to plant non-approved varieties that mature 
quicker, but are lower in quality. Later, legislators passed a new 
law allowing farmers to plant any cotton variety. 
</P>
<P>
	Although some farmers found limited success in short-season  
types from last year, many are not convinced planting lower-grade 
cotton will be a magic bullet solution to bouncing back from last 
year's dismal season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real emotional issue for a lot of people,'' said Chuck  
Nichols, whose family has been growing cotton in Hanford for nearly 
half a century. ``My attitude is going to be wait and see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like most farmers in the San Joaquin Valley, where nearly all  
California cotton is grown, Nichols plans to set aside a small 
portion of his fields to test non-acala varieties. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was El Nino and although there appeared to be some  
good success with some of the short-season cotton, I'm not sure if 
that'll carry over for a more average year,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture scientists and researchers also will be testing new  
varieties this year. 
</P>
<P>
	University of California, Davis, Cooperative Extension plans to  
conduct tests on at least a dozen different varieties in six 
locations in the central and southern San Joaquin Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Although most cotton varieties have been proven in other states,  
weather and soil conditions in California may translate to 
different results, said Bob Hutmacher, UC Cooperative Extension 
cotton specialist. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think most of the people are interested in exploring what  
kind of possibilities there are with these new varieties,'' said 
Hutmacher. ``Most of them are savvy, diversified growers, so I 
don't think they'll jump into it wholeheartedly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only way for farmers to switch completely would be if the  
non-approved varieties make up for lower prices by producing much 
higher yields than acalas or pimas, Hutmacher said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why this year's tests are so crucial.  
</P>
<P>
	But despite the unknowns, the opportunity to choose from a wide  
variety of cottons is important, said Mike Fraley, general manager 
of Germains Cotton Seeds Inc., in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
	``California uplands will give growers opportunity to maximize  
their profits, but if they still want to plant acalas, they can do 
that as well,'' Fraley said. ``I won't tell growers that these 
uplands will save your soul or bail you out financially, but it's a 
choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fraley admitted the change in state law took him by surprise. He  
thinks demand for non-approved variety seeds will outpace the 
supply this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Germains was sold out on at least one short-season variety seeds  
a couple of weeks ago, even though planting doesn't start until 
March 15, he said.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls, Japanese Stocks Rise / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen today following a  
report that a senior finance official in Tokyo predicted that 
Japan's currency would rebound as soon as this summer. Japanese 
stocks rose sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.34 yen in late afternoon trading, down  
1.64 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York 
level of 120.91 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 243.98 points,  
or 1.71 percent, to close at 14,500.65. On Monday, the average 
closed up 158.63 points, or 1.13 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar retreated in Tokyo after  
climbing to an 11 week high against the yen on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said it lost ground after Eisuke Sakakibara, a top  
finance ministry official dubbed ``Mr. Yen'' for his influence over 
currency markets, was quoted in today's edition of the business 
daily Nihon Keizai as predicting that the yen will strengthen if 
the economy recovers this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sakakibara's comments gave us the impression that Japanese  
monetary authorities don't want excessive weakness of the yen,'' 
said Koichi Kubo, assistant general manager of foreign exchange at 
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar fell as low as 119.80 yen and rose as high as 121.37  
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro, meanwhile, traded at 132.95 yen, down from 134.40 yen  
late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices closed at the highest  
level since Dec. 10 after the Dow Jones industrial average posted 
its biggest gain in five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York on Monday, the Dow surged 212.73, or 2.3 percent, to  
9,552.68, leaving it within 90 points of its Jan. 8 all time high 
of 9,643.32. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo market was also bolstered by optimism that more  
aggressive restructuring efforts at Japanese companies such as NEC 
Corp. will increase profit growth, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan's recent moves to stimulate the economy by  
easing monetary policy helped buoy share prices as well, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section gained 8.86 points, or 0.80 percent, to 1,117.77. The 
TOPIX closed up 14.41 points, or 1.32 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 560.68 million shares changed hands on the first  
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, up from 409.39 million shares 
on Monday. Advancers exceeded decliners 739 to 481, with 90 issues 
closing unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.855 percent from Monday's finish of 1.725 percent, 
driving its price down to 99.56 yen from 100.60 yen.

<HEADLINE> GOP Argues As Democrats Push Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ten days after the close of President  
Clinton's impeachment trial, congressional Republicans are still 
laboring to settle on an agenda while Democrats are seizing the 
offensive with proposals ranging from Social Security to the 
minimum wage to campaign finance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that if the speaker would schedule a Patients' Bill  
of Rights, a minimum wage increase, and campaign finance reform in 
the next month, we could get all three of those measures passed in 
a bipartisan way,'' House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt said 
Tuesday after congressional leaders met with the president at the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., isn't likely to do anything  
like that, and Democrats know it. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have a series of legislative goals -- a tax cut,  
Social Security fixes and education among them -- but other than a 
bill to raise military pay now pending in the Senate, and a measure 
to cut strings on aid to education, they have little legislation 
ready or even a consensus among the rank-and-file on how to 
proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans minimize the Democratic program as little more  
than symbolic gestures that have minimal constituencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks a little like a stall agenda, a getting-nothing-done  
agenda,'' said Larry Craig of Idaho, a member of the Senate GOP 
leadership. ``I think they're driving toward a 2000 strategy of 
saying the Republican Congress couldn't get anything done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the long run, these early feints could count for little.  
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, when Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott was still  
settling into his job, it was spring before momentum built toward 
the balanced budget accord that produced major tax cuts and 
spending reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Hastert is less than two months into his tenure as speaker.  
And congressional Democrats who lined up with Clinton during 
impeachment privately express the belief that it's only a matter of 
time before the president begins to seek middle-of-the-road 
compromises with Republicans on major issues such as tax cuts and 
Social Security. That would allow him to burnish his legacy, and 
allow the GOP to claim progress on major topics as they head into 
the 2000 campaign year. 
</P>
<P>
	But for now, Democrats have pivoted out of the Clinton  
impeachment trial nicely. The president is expected on Capitol Hill 
next week for a pep rally designed to underscore their domestic 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, efforts are under way to force campaign finance  
legislation to the floor in case Hastert attempts to block it. This 
time, advocates will insist on stricter time limits on debate, to 
avoid what Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., calls ``manipulation of the 
Republican leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., toyed with the  
idea of trying to attach a minimum wage increase to the first bill 
on the floor. He decided not to, for now. But Hastert signaled 
flexibility on this subject over the weekend. Republican aides and 
lawmakers concede such a measure is likely to clear both houses, 
noting that strong economic growth will blunt claims that an 
increase will cost jobs. The presence of numerous Republican 
freshmen on the ballot in 2000 makes a Senate filibuster strategy 
less likely, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats already have reintroduced a health care measure that  
died in the Senate last year that would strengthen the ability of 
patients to deal with their managed care companies. Republicans 
passed their own bill in the House, but it never came up in the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	On this issue, as well, Republicans are seeking to blunt the  
Democratic offensive, while finessing, at least for the time being, 
the core Democratic demand that patients be permitted to sue their 
HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
	Two officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, say Hastert  
is weighing a plan to seek votes on narrowly drawn measures, 
possibly including one that would give women the right to see a 
gynecologist without needing permission from a primary caregiver. 
This and other bills could be brought to the floor under procedures 
that limit debate, bar amendments and require two-thirds majority 
for passage. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans, battered in the polls during impeachment,  
emerged with less of a concrete plan. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, the leadership has established working groups on  
several issues with a goal of developing a ``60-day marketing 
plan,'' according to one recent memo, ``to drive our message 
outside the Beltway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On taxes, Lott traveled to Michigan last week to tout a 10  
percent across the board cut, and Rep. John Kasich, House Budget 
Committee chairman, has made it the centerpiece of his expected run 
for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	But several rank-and-file Republicans voiced objections at a  
closed-door House retreat earlier this month, and an internal 
Senate GOP poll cautioned that the proposal's appeal is limited. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, GOP leaders mention the cut as one of several tax  
reductions they could bring to the floor, along with a cut in the 
so-called marriage penalty and estate taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``My attitude is, any time we want to debate which tax cuts, I'm  
ready,'' Lott told the nation's governors on Tuesday. ``I like them 
all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--------

<HEADLINE> Layoffs Hit Country Music Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Merle Haggard may have summed up the  
current state of country music with a line from a 1982 hit: ``Are 
the good times really over for good?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Layoffs have hit the country music industry.  
</P>
<P>
	After reaching record heights in 1995, country album sales have  
sagged. Sales were up a feeble 2.7 percent in 1998, and the gain 
was due largely to one artist: Garth Brooks, who accounted for 10 
percent of the nearly 73 million albums sold, according to 
SoundScan, which tracks sales. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the industry has been unable to launch new  
acts able to generate the kind of pop-star revenue that Brooks and 
Shania Twain produce. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Arista Nashville, a division of RCA, fired six  
executives last week. Song publisher Sony/ATV Tree dropped about 
half of its Nashville roster of 100 songwriters in October, citing 
declining royalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercury and MCA Records, owned by Seagram Co., have laid off  
seven country-division employees between them. And the publishing 
divisions of PolyGram and MCA will soon merge, costing jobs, 
primarily in country music. 
</P>
<P>
	Some worry that a repeat of the mid-1980s may be in store.  
That's when the bottom fell out of the country music boom started 
by the 1980 movie ``Urban Cowboy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The consumer is changing,'' said Joe Galante, who runs the  
Nashville office for RCA Records. ``And I'm not sure everybody's 
got their finger on the pulse. Clearly there is a problem in terms 
of what we are doing as an industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nashville may be a victim of its own phenomenal success. Revenue  
from the sale of country music albums quadrupled between 1989 and 
1995 to about $2 billion, when Brooks became one of the most 
recognizable celebrities in America. 
</P>
<P>
	As the money rolled in, companies like Warner Bros. and MCA  
built expensive office buildings, gave employees raises and hired 
more people. Now those companies are looking to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Small record companies Rising Tide, Magnatone, Almo Sounds,  
Imprint and Decca have all closed their doors in the past couple of 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a total surprise to me, to everybody,'' said Kim  
Fowler, a publicist who had barely started a job at Rising Tide a 
year ago when the company folded. ``People are getting squeezed out 
and they have nowhere to go in the music business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Promising singers like Shane Stockton, Chris Knight and Matraca  
Berg have lost their record deals. Dolly Parton did, too, when 
Decca closed last month, although she won't have trouble getting 
another deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever you mix art and commerce, you put yourself in danger  
of the current craze or trends or style,'' said Jimmie Fadden of 
The Dirt Band, country music veterans who were about to release an 
album on Rising Tide when the label closed. They have since signed 
with DreamWorks SKG. 
</P>
<P>
	Galante estimated that 10 percent of record company staffers may  
be cut in the long run, and as many as 20 percent of songwriters 
will lose the stipends from publishing companies that allow them to 
write full time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that we're not done with consolidation,'' he said.  
``We have been carrying, probably, just a little too much in the 
way of manpower.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nashville has survived such trends before. The industry  
rebounded from the decline in the mid-1980s to reach unprecedented 
heights. And even now, far more country albums are being sold now 
than a decade ago, and country music remains the most popular radio 
format by far. 
</P>
<P>
	Del Bryant of New York-based BMI, which distributes songwriting  
royalties, said all the changes could help in the long run. Larger 
companies will be leaner and the consolidations may allow smaller 
record companies to re-emerge, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nashville is the classic town that takes two steps forward,  
then one step back,'' said Bryant, who started his career in Music 
City.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Cracking Down on Umpires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball's plan to raise the strike zone has  
raised the ire of umpires, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Friday, a memo was sent to all 30 major league teams,  
telling them the official definition of the strike zone ``will be 
more strictly enforced'' by umpires this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The note came from Sandy Alderson, the new executive director of  
baseball operations and part of the restructured commissioner's 
office under Bud Selig. 
</P>
<P>
	The move appears designed to get umpires to call higher strikes.  
In recent years, umpires rarely called any pitch above the belt a 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
	But umpires union head Richie Phillips said his people were left  
out of the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Neither the umpires or the umpires association were consulted  
on this issue,'' Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see how anyone could say we're going to more strictly  
enforce a rule,'' he said. ``The umpires enforce all of the rules. 
That's been their job for more than 100 years. It is deplorable for 
the commissioner's office to indicate that the umpires have not 
strictly enforced all of the rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a rarity, the players association backed owners.  
</P>
<P>
	``There never has been a good reason for why players should have  
to adjust to 32 different strike zones, so some effort to make the 
strike zone more uniform is to be welcomed,'' said Gene Orza, the 
No. 2 official of the players union. 
</P>
<P>
	The existence of the memo, which was sent to teams Friday, was  
first reported Monday by the Los Angeles Times, and a copy of the 
memo was obtained by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is to inform you that, at the direction of commissioner  
Selig, and after consultation with the league presidents, the 
`strike zone' as defined in the official playing rules will be more 
strictly enforced in 1999 by umpires in both leagues,'' Alderson 
wrote to teams. 
</P>
<P>
	In the memo, which was sent to all managers and general  
managers, Alderson said that while the top of the strike zone is 
difficult to define, ``the upper limit of the strike zone will 
extend two inches above the top of the uniform pants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Criticism of differing strike zones escalated during the 1997 NL  
playoffs when a wide strike zone by Eric Gregg led to a 
15-strikeout game by Florida's Livan Hernandez against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	AL umpires were criticized for several blown calls during last  
year's playoffs, one of the reasons Selig is trying to shift 
responsibility over umpires away from the leagues to Alderson. 
</P>
<P>
	``The strike zone is the strike zone,'' Phillips said. ``Is  
there a different strike zone in the American League and National 
League? Definitely not. Some of them may see it different, but the 
strike zone is the strike zone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The umpires' labor agreement expires after this season, and a  
confrontation between owners and umpires is expected. Umpires have 
been demanding more backing since 1996, when Roberto Alomar, then 
of the Baltimore Orioles, spit at umpire John Hirschbeck and was 
suspended for only five games. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, umpires have demanded owners and players agree to a  
``code of conduct.'' While there were several meetings two years 
ago, agreement on a code has still proved elusive. 
</P>
<P>
	Alderson's memo may heighten tensions between the sides.  
</P>
<P>
	``But I'm not surprised by what goes on in the baseball offices  
at Park Avenue,'' Phillips said.

<HEADLINE>  Gilkey Nixes Trade to Pirates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Despite the laser eye surgery he underwent  
last September, Bernard Gilkey couldn't see himself in a Pittsburgh 
Pirates uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona outfielder refused a restructuring of his contract  
on Tuesday, killing a trade that would have sent him to the Pirates 
for infielder Tony Womack and outfielder Al Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision had nothing to do with money. Gilkey just wanted to  
stay with the Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no knock against the Pittsburgh organization or  
anything like that,'' Gilkey said. ``This choice was made for me 
and the benefit of my family, and the possibility of taking us to 
post-season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gilkey, 32, talked about the Diamondbacks' struggles he saw  
after he was traded to Arizona by the New York Mets last July 31. 
He watched in anticipation as the Diamondbacks spent $118.9 million 
on free agents in the offseason, building a pitching rotation 
that's one of the best in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	He also knew of the trades Pittsburgh had made to bring in  
outfielders in the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the outfield is a little more crowded in Pittsburgh,''  
Gilkey said. ``I did what I felt was best for me and my family and 
what we would enjoy. I wanted to be in a nice atmosphere and I want 
to be around a team that's moving in the right direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diamondbacks' general manager Joe Garagiola Jr. was disappointed  
but somewhat flattered. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you're always disappointed when you work on a deal and  
it doesn't go together,'' Garagiola said. ``But in one sense I 
can't be unhappy about a player who says `Look, I see all the 
things you're doing and I want to be a part of that.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The collapse of the deal left the Diamondbacks still searching  
for a leadoff hitter and some much-needed speed. Garagiola was on 
the phone about other possible trades Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilkey was in a position to veto the trade because the remaining  
two years of his contract needed to be restructured before the 
Diamondbacks would go through with the deal. Gilkey is due $11 
million for the next two years, with half of the money deferred. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks were willing to pay the deferred amount, but  
Gilkey had to sign off on some changes in the details. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both clubs did a lot of work on this,'' Pirates' general  
manager Cam Bonifay said. ``Arizona did a lot of work with their 
player, but he decided he didn't want to take the deal that was 
presented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin is not happy with the prospect of spending a season as a  
Pirates' reserve, and Womack's status as second baseman is in 
jeopardy because Pittsburgh signed free agent Pat Meares to play 
shortstop and planned to switch Mike Benjamin to second. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonifay indicated the Pirates would look elsewhere to make a  
trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the opportunity presents itself, and we felt we could get  
quality players and it was a situation where it might help out, we 
might (make a trade),'' Bonifay said. ``If not, we'll get together 
with (owner) Kevin McClatchy and see where he wants to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gilkey hit. 248 with just five RBIs in 29 games with Arizona  
after being acquired in a trade that sent Jorge Fabregas and Willie 
Blair to the Mets. For the season, he hit .233 with five homers and 
33 RBIs, far below his standout 1996 season, when he hit .317 with 
30 homers and 117 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	He says he's seeing things more clearly since the laser surgery,  
and hopes that will translate into better hitting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the clarity is there,'' Gilkey said. ``I think the  
focus on the baseball is there, like picking up the spin of the 
ball. It's definitely a big plus for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gilkey likely won't stay in left field. The Diamondbacks plan to  
use Luis Gonzalez there, shifting Gilkey to right. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I'm athletic enough to make the adjustment,''  
Gilkey said. ``It's going to be something new, but it's just 
another challenge, another page in the book, and I'm ready to 
accept the challenge.''

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Pippen's Lockers Sealed Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- If Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen aren't going  
to use their lockers in the Chicago Bulls dressing room, no one 
will. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls arrived at the United Center for Tuesday's game  
against the Milwaukee Bucks to find Jordan and Pippen's old lockers 
covered by boards. No one will use the spaces this season out of 
respect for Jordan and Pippen, who led Chicago to six NBA titles, 
but team spokesman Tim Hallam said the Bulls haven't decided 
exactly what will be done with the lockers. 
</P>
<P>
	Except for a preseason game, Jordan and Pippen's lockers have  
been off-limits to the new Bulls, most of whom didn't play with His 
Airness and his trusty sidekick. 
</P>
<P>
	After winning their sixth championship in eight years last June,  
the Bulls are in the midst of a major rebuilding effort. Jordan 
retired, and the rest of the championship team scattered soon 
after. Pippen now plays for the Houston Rockets.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans End Mixed / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) --Grain and soybean futures finished mixed Tuesday  
in quiet trading on the Chicago Board of Trade.	
</P>
<P>
        Futures prices were buoyed by buying from commodity funds seeking  
bargains after several sessions of losses. The rally faltered, however, 
in light of a report from the U.S. Agriculture Department indicating 
supplies will remain ample. 
</P>
<P>
        The USDA predicted farmers may bring in a record soybean crop  
for the third consecutive year. The department projected the soybean 
crop could rise 5 percent over last year, to 2.895 billion bushels, 
as plantings increase 1.5 percent to a record 73.5 million acres. 
</P>
<P>
        Corn and wheat plantings were expected to decline. The department  
projected the wheat harvest will decline 14.7 percent from last year, 
making it the smallest since 1991, as plantings fall 5 percent. The 
corn crop was expected to be 2.8 percent smaller than a year ago as 
plantings fall 2.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
        Although that was potentially good news, market participants  
also noted comments made Monday by the USDA's chief economist that 
exports will remain extremely weak through the year. Also, Argentina 
and Brazil are getting ready to harvest bumper competing supplies. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat for March delivery was unchanged at $2.51 3/4 a bushel;  
March corn rose 1 cent to $2.15 a bushel; March oats rose 3/4 cent 
to $1.02 1/4 a bushel; March soybeans were unchanged at $4.74 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
        Beef futures rose sharply on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange  
after the government said shipments of donated beef to Russia will 
begin in just a few weeks, amove that could prompt heavy buying on 
cash markets. Pork futures finished mixed. 
</P>
<P>
        April live cattle rose 1.17 cents to 67.62 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle rose 1.20 cents to 73.97 cents a pound; April lean hogs 
fell 0.55 cent to 45.25 cents a pound; March pork bellies rose 0.25 
cent to 52.80 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Vikings' Offensive Coordinator Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Fish stories, and a bright future.  
That's how the Minnesota Vikings remembered offensive coordinator 
Chip Myers on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Myers, a career assistant who was promoted to his first  
coordinator's job last month, died of a heart attack at his 
suburban home. He was 53. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 28 years as a coach I've never had a more tragic thing  
happen,'' coach Dennis Green said. 
</P>
<P>
	Myers' death came without warning and shocked the Vikings.  
Although Myers was a casual smoker, there had been no signs 
pointing to a potentially serious health problem. 
</P>
<P>
	He recently spent a week in Hawaii with the rest of the Vikings  
coaches for the Pro Bowl, and had been with the staff in 
Indianapolis over the weekend for the NFL scouting combine. 
</P>
<P>
	The coaches returned together late Monday afternoon, and Myers  
died several hours later at his home in Long Lake. Police found his 
body on his bed about 3:30 a.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's devastating,'' outside linebackers coach Trent Walters  
said. ``It's like losing a member of the family, like losing a 
brother. Because we were just that tight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walters was the last Vikings assistant to talk to Myers at the  
airport Monday. They made tentative plans to go ice fishing Tuesday 
night -- ``He was the guy responsible for me being a high-tech 
fisherman,'' Walters said -- following a day of meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	But Myers' familiar blue truck was noticeably missing from the  
parking lot Tuesday as the rest of the coaches began arriving for a 
7 a.m. meeting. When the assistants went inside, Green told them 
the excruciating news he had received about 5:15 a.m. from Myers' 
wife, Susie. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there was anybody in this building who was loved  
more than he was,'' said defensive coordinator Foge Fazio, who 
worked with Myers seven of the last eight season with the New York 
Jets and Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Panama City, Fla., and a former Pro Bowl receiver  
with the Cincinnati Bengals, Myers came to Minnesota in 1995. He 
coached receivers in 1995-97, and shifted to quarterbacks last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Under his guidance, Randall Cunningham went from a backup role  
to the Pro Bowl. Cunningham led the Vikings to the most points in 
NFL history and a 15-1 regular-season record before an upset loss 
to Atlanta in the NFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a big part of my success,'' Cunningham said, ``and I'll  
carry the teachings and things I've learned from him onto the field 
each game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When former offensive coordinator Brian Billick left two days  
after the Atlanta loss to take the top job with the Baltimore 
Ravens, Green wasted no time putting Myers in charge of the NFL's 
most prolific offense. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings led the league in both of Myers' specialties last  
season. They converted 51 percent of the time on third down -- no 
one else topped 46 percent -- and scored on 53 of 56 trips inside 
the opponents' 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was really just starting to show what he could do,'' Green  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether it was game day at the Metrodome or the offseason in his  
bass boat on Lake Minnetonka, Myers' calm, laid-back demeanor never 
changed, something that made him popular among his peers. He was 
typically low-key when he was promoted last month, calling the 
coordinator's job one he had hoped for, but not one for which he 
had been trying to position himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been ready to do this for 10 years,'' he said. ``I've  
just never (promoted) myself to do it, and I would never do that at 
all. ... A (job) title to me, it doesn't mean one thing. It never 
has, and hopefully it never will. I'm not comfortable even with

win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wanted to be somewhere where he could fish, too. Fazio said  
the combination of football and the outdoors made Minnesota the 
most rewarding stop in Myers' coaching career. 
</P>
<P>
	``He loved football, and he loved fishing. He got all that here  
in Minnesota,'' Fazio said. ``He was very, very happy here. We're 
all happy he got a chance to experience that. It's kind of sad he 
didn't get a chance to see how far he could go being an offensive 
coordinator in this league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Myers is survived by his wife and five children ranging in age  
from 21 to 31. Funeral services were scheduled for 1 p.m. Friday at 
Indian Hill Church in Cincinnati, where Myers played for the 
Bengals from 1969-76.

	Guilty Verdict in Dragging Death Case  
</P>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- A white supremacist was convicted of  
capital murder today for chaining a black man to a pickup truck and 
dragging him to his death in one of the nation's grisliest hate 
crimes in decades. Jurors deliberated less than 2 1/2 hours before 
returning their verdict against John William King, who now faces 
either life in prison or execution. The panel of 11 whites and one 
black will decide his punishment after a separate phase of 
testimony.

	Albanians Give Deal Tentative OK  
</P>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- Talks at the Kosovo peace conference  
have been recessed until next month without an agreement, but U.S. 
officials say ethnic Albanians have tentatively approved a truce. 
The Albanians want two weeks to ``sell'' the plan to their 
constituents. The Serbs continue to balk at NATO troops policing an 
agreement, something Secretary of State Madeleine Albright says is 
key to a deal. Both sides are being warned to respect the 
cease-fire until the talks resume March 15 in France. NATO says 
airstrikes against Yugoslavia remain an option.

	INNSBRUCK, Austria (AP) -- At least seven people were killed  
today when an avalanche smashed into a small town in the Alps in 
western Austria today. About 35 people were feared buried. At least 
13 people were injured, some critically, in the latest of a series 
of deadly avalanches this winter in Europe. At least 20 people, 
some of them critically injured, were rescued by early evening, 
Austrian television said. Heavy snowfalls have set off a series of 
avalanches in the Alps in recent weeks, claiming lives in France, 
Switzerland and Austria. Snowstorms snarled traffic and halted 
trains today in Germany.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today kicked off a national  
campaign to enroll millions more children in Medicaid, using 
household products and a toll-free phone number to encourage 
parents to seek federal health benefits for them. Clinton announced 
the ``Insure Kids Now'' campaign, which seeks to educate families 
on eligibility for Medicaid and the new Children's Health Insurance 
Program. The president has stated a goal of enrolling 5 million of 
the estimated 10 million eligible children in Medicaid within five 
years.

<P>
	KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) -- At least 140 people in Sudan have died  
from meningitis and 1,000 more are suffering from the virus that 
affects the brain, a health official said today. The Sudanese News 
Agency reported that the disease first surfaced last month in West 
Darfur state, where 24 deaths were reported. Meningitis, an acute 
inflammation of the membranes around the brain or spinal cord, is 
usually connected with severe summers. Many parts of Sudan are in 
the midst of a heat wave, with temperatures in Khartoum reaching 
110 degrees today.

today for boycotting an international heroin conference because it 
was taking place in Myanmar, one of the world's biggest producers 
of the drug. Participants at the 4th International Heroin 
Conference said the boycott by the world's biggest heroin-consuming 
nations ran counter to the spirit of international cooperation 
against drug trafficking. But Washington and other critics have 
charged that Myanmar's military regime has failed to seriously 
crack down on drugs and has such a poor human rights record that it 
does not deserve the legitimacy conferred by the conference.

	Court Makes It Harder To Sue NCAA  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today made it harder to sue  
the NCAA under a law banning sex bias in educational programs 
receiving federal aid. The justices said that the fact that the 
NCAA gets dues from federally financed colleges and universities 
doesn't open it up to lawsuits under the anti-bias law known as 
Title IX. But the high court said lower courts should consider 
other arguments that would make the NCAA subject to Title IX 
lawsuits. Renee Smith filed the lawsuit claiming she was illegally 
declared ineligible to play intercollegiate volleyball.

<HEADLINE> Inquiry Opens in Ship Grounding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- A Coast Guard inquiry into the grounding  
of the cargo ship New Carissa opened Tuesday, focusing on the 
captain's decision to ride out a storm close to shore amid fierce 
winds and powerful swells. 
</P>
<P>
	The first witness, a maritime expert, appeared to back the  
captain, testifying that anchoring just offshore in shallow water 
is accepted industry practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shallower water is more favorable,'' said John Betz, a former  
oil tanker captain for Chevron. ``Everybody wants to get into 
shallower water if they can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Betz said anchoring in shallow water helps reduce the stress on  
the anchor chain and allows the ship to drift in a tighter circle. 
He noted, however, that the captain must keep monitoring 
navigational systems to make sure the anchor doesn't start dragging 
along the sea bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	That's apparently what happened Feb. 4 when the 639-foot ship  
ran aground on a beach north of Coos Bay while its crew was waiting 
for a maritime pilot stranded ashore by stormy weather. 
</P>
<P>
	The vessel eventually cracked open under pounding waves and  
spilled as much as 70,000 gallons of gooey bunker oil onto Oregon 
beaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Under cross-examination, Betz pointed out that anchoring is not  
an exact science and it is largely the captain's judgment call. 
</P>
<P>
	State and federal officials launched the inquiry, in part, to  
determine whether the New Carissa broke state law when it anchored 
so close to the beach without having a local maritime pilot on 
board. 
</P>
<P>
	Depending on the findings, civil claims or criminal charges  
could be levied against the ship's operator and officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Under state law, penalties for unlawfully piloting a vessel such  
as the New Carissa too near the Oregon shore include as much as a 
$50,000 fine and six months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile Tuesday, fog and howling winds thwarted attempts to  
rig the broken bow of the grounded cargo ship with a 10-inch-thick, 
1,100-yard-long cable that will be used to tow it out to sea. 
</P>
<P>
	If the cable can be rigged during daylight hours Wednesday,  
plans call for the tug Sea Victory to make the first attempt to 
pull the charred bow of the New Carissa and the thick oil remaining 
inside off the beach Wednesday evening at high tide. 
</P>
<P>
	Once afloat, the bow will be towed 200 miles out to sea and sunk  
by gunfire in thousands of feet of water.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Meets With Congess Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today met with the  
congressional leaders of both parties for the first time in 19 
months. All sides promised to work together despite the partisan 
bitterness generated by the impeachment battle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all took an oath and I think we intend to follow it,''  
Clinton said, when asked by reporters if they could set aside 
differences. ``We owe it to the American people and I'm looking 
forward to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, who joined Clinton in the Oval  
Office two months after voting to impeach him, said, ``We're 
starting to work to put together ideas. That's the first step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Creating bipartisan commissions to tackle such politically  
volatile issues as Social Security, tax reform and missile defense 
was one idea tossed around, said Hastert. 
</P>
<P>
	Also present at the meeting with House Minority Leader Dick  
Gephardt, Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle and White House chief 
of staff John Podesta were House Majority Leader Dick Armey and 
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott -- both of whom also voted to 
impeach or convict the president on charges of perjury and 
obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	After the meeting, Lott refused reporters' bait to repeat his  
post-impeachment complaint that the president is untrustworthy. ``I 
trust the ability of the people here in the Congress and the 
government to work together to do what needs to be done for the 
people,'' said Lott, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert suggested that Republicans had not yet decided their tax  
agenda, with the party's lawmakers variously pushing for an 
elimination of the marriage penalty, an across-the-board rate cut, 
and an end to taxes on Social Security benefits for retirees who 
continue to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of things that we're looking at and I think that  
whatever we do, it's going to be part of mix,'' said Hastert, 
R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporting on the Kosovo peace talks, Clinton said ``a lot of  
progress'' had been achieved but that ``there are still some 
important disagreements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton met with the leaders to hash out legislative priorities  
from Social Security to education and to review administration 
policy in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	All sides say they are looking for consensus on domestic issues  
as the president and Congress try to put the impeachment process 
behind them. 
</P>
<P>
	In an address to the Democratic Governors Association Monday  
night, Clinton offered a vigorous defense of his administration's 
continued involvement in the peace processes in the Northern 
Ireland, the Middle East, Africa and Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``No country turns away from its common values and common  
humanity even for a moment without paying a price,'' he said. 
``Every night I thank God we have a chance to work for peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today's meeting was the first time in 19 months that Clinton had  
met with the Republican leaders in Congress. With many GOP 
lawmakers still smarting from their failed effort to drive Clinton 
from office, the session was being seen as a chance to clear the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the president wanted to  
focus on his fiscal 2000 proposals to overhaul Social Security and 
Medicare, improve education, and pass a patients' bill of rights 
and a minimum wage hike. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the president has long said that we need to move  
forward in a way that best advances the interests of Social 
Security, Medicare,'' Lockhart said. ``And I think the way we're 
going to do that is working with Democrats and Republicans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said he would press Clinton to support plans before a  
commission reviewing the Medicare program that would revamp the 
system, which is facing a budget crunch in 2008. Lott said the 
overhaul plan was one vote shy of commission approval.

<HEADLINE> Internet Fraud Complaints Jump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Con artists who've migrated to Internet  
auctions are largely to blame for a sixfold jump in consumer 
complaints of online fraud since 1997, a consumer group said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Auction fraud last year accounted for two out of every three  
complaints to Internet Fraud Watch, an online fraud reporting 
system created by the National Consumers League. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington, D.C.-based group reported at a hearing on  
Internet fraud today that the number of complaints jumped from 
1,280 in 1997 to 7,752 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 10 sources of fraud complaints reported to the group  
are, in order of frequency: auctions, general merchandise sales, 
computer equipment and software, Internet services, work-at-home 
offers, business opportunities, marketing schemes, credit card 
offers, advance fee loans and employment offers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission is beefing up its surveillance of  
Internet fraud, but the agency says that such crimes are not yet 
among its top complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	Eileen Harrington of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection  
said the agency plans to set up a special unit next month to 
monitor the Internet 24 hours a day to look out for scam artists. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the FTC tracked down a group of three people  
who were charging customers without their knowledge for nonexistent 
Internet services valued at a total of $45 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people had never heard of this company, and many of them  
didn't even have computers,'' Harrington said at a hearing on 
Internet crime today in Trenton sponsored by New Jersey's attorney 
general and the New Jersey Commission on Investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey is one of a handful of regional governments  
experimenting with efforts to crack down on a fraud that defies 
local, state and national boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
	New York City's Department of Consumer Affairs said last month  
it is looking into whether some online auction sellers are falsely 
labeling baseballs supposedly signed by such legends as Babe Ruth 
and Roberto Clemente, as ``one-of-a-kind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer advocates say people who buy on the Internet should use  
either a credit card or buy through an escrow service, a third 
party that will hold payment of the check until the consumer is 
satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
	``If somebody sends a check or a money order off-line to  
somebody they don't know, they're asking for trouble,'' Harrington 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rise in fraud has also driven the growth of fraud watchers  
such as Cyveillance, a company that helps clients track down bogus 
sellers of their products. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found people on the Internet who were selling fake Gucci  
bags, fake Coach bags,'' Cyveillance President Christopher Young 
said. ``We run across pretty much anything you can think of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups say rising fraud has mirrored the surge that has  
brought 79 million Americans to the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest of the online auctioneers, San Jose, Calif.-based  
eBay, is only four years old and now has 2.1 million registered 
users trading everything from Barbie dolls to Mercedes-Benzes.

<HEADLINE>  Marlin Rookie To Get Radiation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida Marlins rookie third baseman Mike  
Lowell will undergo a short course of radiation for treatment of 
testicular cancer, and he's expected to join the team later this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Pathology reports indicate that Lowell's chance of recovery is  
excellent, team physician Dr. Dan Kanell said Tuesday. The cancer 
didn't spread beyond a testicle removed in outpatient surgery 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Under the circumstances, it's the best-case scenario,'' Kanell  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell, who turns 25 Wednesday, was diagnosed with seminoma  
after a small mass was found during a routine physical examination. 
He was to begin spring training workouts Friday and was considered 
the front-runner to become Florida's starting third baseman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel optimistic and have a positive attitude,'' Lowell said  
in a statement. ``Everything is pointing in the right direction. My 
faith, family and friends have been the key ingredients in this 
battle. We are a formidable army, and the cancer didn't have a 
chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Dave Dombrowski said it's uncertain when Lowell  
will join the Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody reacts to radiation in different ways,'' Dombrowski  
said. ``He has a long career ahead of him, and he will be a fine 
big-league player. The important thing is for him to get healthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell, who grew up in Miami, was acquired Feb. 1 from the New  
York Yankees for three pitching prospects. Last year he hit .304 at 
Triple-A Columbus with 26 homers and 99 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Orie, who hit .263 in 48 games for the Marlins last year,  
is likely to be the opening-day third baseman.

<HEADLINE> Baldwin Wants To Play Tooth Fairy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Alec Baldwin wants to play the tooth fairy.  
</P>
<P>
	The star of ``The Juror'' and ``The Edge'' has asked parents in  
New York and New Jersey to donate their children's baby teeth to 
medical science. 
</P>
<P>
	Baldwin affixed his signature to 15,000 letters that began going  
out Monday as part of a study of Americans' exposure to 
radioactivity. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at the Radiation and Public Health Project want to  
examine the level of radiation in the teeth to find out whether the 
food moms ate during their pregnancy was contaminated, said Dr. Jay 
Gould, the project's director. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am writing you as someone personally concerned that our high  
cancer rates may be influenced by radioactive reactor emissions in 
the greater New York metropolitan area,'' Baldwin wrote in the 
letter sent to families on Long Island and near Toms River, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	``We only need one or two of the baby teeth that your children  
lose between the ages of five and twelve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The actor's mother, Carol Baldwin, survived breast cancer.  
</P>
<P>
	Gould said his group hoped to analyze 1,000 teeth by the end of  
the year.

<HEADLINE>  Astros Open Workouts Without Alou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- It's been a bummer of an offseason for the  
Houston Astros. 
</P>
<P>
	First, Randy Johnson left. Then they failed to get Roger  
Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, they're likely to be missing Moises Alou for the entire  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not as good a team today as were yesterday,'' manager  
Larry Dierker said Tuesday as full-squad workouts began in 
Kissimmee, Fla. ``I'm sure it's going to be more subdued out there 
among the veteran players. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston found out Monday that Alou tore the anterior cruciate  
ligament in his left knee when he fell during a treadmill workout. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody's going to replace Alou, but we have some guys who can  
come close.,'' Dierker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Hidalgo, who split time in center last year with Carl  
Everett, likely will take over from Alou in left. Third baseman Ken 
Caminiti, who came back to Houston as a free agent, is expected to

title.

ineffective in the postseason.

coming in and finding out that Alou is going down. He's a great

sure we'll be all right.''

<HEADLINE>  Astros Open Workouts Without Alou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- It's been a bummer of an offseason for the  
Houston Astros. 
</P>
<P>
	First, Randy Johnson left. Then they failed to get Roger  
Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, they're likely to be missing Moises Alou for the entire  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not as good a team today as were yesterday,'' manager  
Larry Dierker said Tuesday as full-squad workouts began in 
Kissimmee, Fla. ``I'm sure it's going to be more subdued out there 
among the veteran players. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston found out Monday that Alou tore the anterior cruciate  
ligament in his left knee when he fell during a treadmill workout. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody's going to replace Alou, but we have some guys who can  
come close.,'' Dierker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Hidalgo, who split time in center last year with Carl  
Everett, likely will take over from Alou in left. Third baseman Ken 
Caminiti, who came back to Houston as a free agent, is expected to 
replace some of Alou's power. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting Camy was great,'' second baseman Craig Biggio said.  
``He gives you a big bat in the No. 4 spot. ``But when you lose Mo, 
that's a big loss. What he did as a player is just hard to

<HEADLINE> Astros' Alou May Miss Whole Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	When Moises Alou fell off a treadmill and hurt himself, the  
Houston Astros figured he might miss most of spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Alou and the Astros got a shocking report: The  
All-Star outfielder tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left 
knee and will likely miss most, if not all, of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a devastating blow for our team,'' Astros general  
manager Gerry Hunsicker said from training camp in Kissimmee, Fla. 
``Clearly, this was the worst-case scenario we could have 
imagined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alou was hurt last Thursday while training at his home in the  
Dominican Republic, losing his balance when he tried to adjust a 
treadmill that was going too fast. The Astros hoped the injury was 
not serious, but an MRI in Houston revealed the damaged ACL. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's probably facing missing most of the year, possibly the  
whole season,'' Hunsicker said. ``I think the best we could hope 
for is that he returns sometime in late August or early 
September.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alou, 32, finished third in the NL MVP voting last season behind  
Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire. Playing his first season in Houston, 
Alou hit .312 with 38 home runs and 124 RBIs in helping the Astros 
win the NL Central championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgery has not been set, though Hunsicker hoped it would happen  
sometime next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody was so shocked by this diagnosis, I think everybody  
is going to take a day or two to gather themselves before anything 
is scheduled,'' Hunsicker said. ``I think he was really stunned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros will rely on Carl Everett and Richard Hidalgo to fill  
Alou's spot in left field. 
</P>
<P>
	Everett hit .296 with 15 homers and 76 RBIs and Hidalgo, 23,  
batted .303 with seven homers and 35 RBIs in 211 at-bats. Hidalgo 
was one of the players mentioned in the past as the Astros tried to 
trade for Roger Clemens, a deal that would have depleted the team's 
depth. 
</P>
<P>
	``But you don't replace an All-Star caliber player,'' Hunsicker  
said. ``We all understand that injuries are part of the game and we 
live in fear of one of our star players being struck down with a 
serious injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunsicker said Alou was hurt when he caught himself in the  
crevice between the treadmill belt and frame. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, the Astros were optimistic the injury was not too  
serious. They knew he would not take part when position players 
began spring training Tuesday, but Hunsicker thought it might be a 
cartilage problem that would take 3-4 weeks to heal. 
</P>
<P>
	``There doesn't appear to be any structural damage, which is  
good news, but we don't know the extent of it until he gets the 
tests,'' Hunsicker said last week. ``He can put weight on it, which 
is also a good sign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the MRI showed far more extensive damage. Alou traveled to  
Houston on Sunday night and was examined by team physician Dr. 
David Linter on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Alou set career highs in almost every offensive category last  
season with 182 hits, 34 doubles and 104 runs as the Astros won 
their second straight division title. 
</P>
<P>
	Alou starred in the 1997 World Series for the Florida Marlins,  
who traded him soon after winning the championship. Under his 
five-year contract, Alou could have demanded a trade after last 
season, but elected to stay after the Astros agreed to give him an 
extra $3 million in 2002.

<HEADLINE> Placido Domingo To Star in 'Le Cid' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tenor Placido Domingo, the artistic director  
of the Washington Opera, will star in one work next season and 
conduct another, while his wife will direct a third. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been with her for 37 years,'' the international opera  
star told a news conference Tuesday. ``She's always been able to 
give me something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Domingo, who also is artistic director of the Los Angeles Opera,  
will take the title role in Washington in Jules Massenet's ``Le 
Cid,'' which has not been done in the United States since 1902. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hadn't expected to still be singing,'' said Domingo, who is  
57. ``I'm very fortunate. I hope I can sing for another four or 
five years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also will conduct Giuseppe Verdi's ``Otello,'' a role he has  
sung nearly 200 times. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, Marta Domingo, will direct Ernanno Wolf-Ferrari's  
``Sly,'' based on Shakespeare's ``The Taming of the Shrew.'' It was 
written more than 70 years ago but is only now getting its North 
American premiere. 
</P>
<P>
	Next season, Mrs. Domingo will direct Verdi's ``Rigoletto.''

	Daley Re-Elected as Chicago Mayor  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Mayor Richard M. Daley easily extended his  
family's political dynasty today, defeating challenger Bobby Rush 
to win a third full term as the city's voters chose a Daley as 
their mayor for the 10th time in half a century. Daley, 56, won on 
the strength of a booming local economy, a highly publicized school 
reform program and sweeping efforts to give the city a facelift. 
Rush, 51, a four-term congressman who was a Black Panther leader in 
the 1960s, had trailed in polls and fund raising throughout the 
campaign. In initial returns, Daley had 3,194 votes, or 94 percent, 
and Rush had 216 votes, or 6 percent.

	ATLANTA (AP) -- A Republican with a reputation for  
consensus-building instead of partisan trench warfare was winning a 
special election today for the House seat vacated by Newt Gingrich. 
The only suspense for front-runner Johnny Isakson was whether he 
would get a majority of the vote in the seven-way race and avoid a 
runoff. With 19 percent of precincts reporting, Isakson had 6,379 
votes, or 56 percent, while the closest contender, Christina 
Jeffrey, had 3,447 votes, or 30 percent.

	Partial Peace Deal Reached in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- Serbs agreed in principle today to  
give limited self-rule to majority ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. The 
partial settlement puts on hold NATO's threats to bomb Serb targets 
if they don't adopt the complex plan that would force them to 
withdraw troops from Kosovo and accept NATO peacekeepers. There was 
no agreement on deploying NATO peacekeepers in the tense province 
to enforce the agreement. According to senior U.S. officials, the 
Serbs still insist on Serbian courts for Serbs accused of crimes, 
refuse to permit the ethnic Albanians to have a president and are 
unwilling to cooperate with a war crimes tribunal looking into 
atrocities against civilians. More talks were scheduled for March.

	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- It took a jury less than 2 1/2 hours today to  
find white supremacist John William King guilty of capital murder 
for dragging a black man to his death. King faces the death penalty 
for the murder of June 7 murder of James Byrd Jr. Courtroom 
spectators applauded and the victim's relatives broke into tears. 
``I am relieved,'' said Stella Brumley, Byrd's sister. ``That's all 
we wanted, was justice.'' King was the first of three white men to 
go on trial in the slaying, which prosecutors said he carried out 
because he wanted ``something dramatic'' to gain credibility for a 
racist group he was organizing.

<HEADLINE> Soccer Star's Dad Home After Kidnap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) -- The father of Mexico's star soccer  
goalkeeper Jorge Campos was safe and at home Tuesday, six days 
after being kidnapped. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexican television stations broke into regular programming to  
report the news to a country seemingly grown numb to repeated waves 
of kidnappings. 
</P>
<P>
	Jorge Campos, the most popular athlete in Mexico, left his team  
in Mexico City and flew to this Pacific resort to meet his father. 
The player spoke briefly outside the family home, saying only that 
his father was well and he did not think a ransom had been paid. 
</P>
<P>
	Alvaro Campos, 66, walked up to a police checkpoint outside  
Acapulco at 8:20 a.m., identified himself and asked for help. He 
was whisked to the Acapulco federal police office, where he met his 
family and taken home. 
</P>
<P>
	Police sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the  
elder Campos sprained his left ankle when he tumbled down an 
embankment last Thursday, trying to flee his captors. 
</P>
<P>
	Police doctors said he appeared tired but otherwise in good  
shape. The sources said he was not blindfolded during captivity and 
was generally treated well. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators suspect Alvaro Campos was held captive at the town  
of Tixtlancingo, high in the Sierra Madre Mountains, according to 
the police sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The place is a known stronghold of the Peasant Organization of  
the Southern Sierra, an activist group linked to the Popular 
Revolutionary Army guerrilla organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The Campos family supports the ruling Institutional  
Revolutionary Party, and Alvaro Campos spoke out several times in 
favor of its candidate Rene Juarez Cisneros, who was elected 
governor of Guerrero state this month. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as eight heavily armed men seized Alvaro Campos shortly  
before 2 p.m. on Feb. 17 at a sports field named for his son in a 
suburb of Acapulco. 
</P>
<P>
	Jorge Campos is famous for flamboyant play as a goalkeeper for  
Mexico's national team, appearing in the 1994 and 1998 World Cups. 
He has played the last three years for professional teams in the 
United States and Mexico, including the reigning Major League 
Soccer champion Chicago Fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico has been plagued by hundreds of kidnappings every year  
for at least the past five years. Ransoms have ranged from hundreds 
to tens of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives of victims rarely complain to police, fearing current  
or former officers may be among the abductors and would pass word 
to the kidnappers.

<HEADLINE> Fed Prepares Extra Cash For Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has a  
word of advice for Americans wondering whether they should withdraw 
a wad of cash on the eve of New Year's Day 2000: Don't. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most sensible thing is to leave it where it is,'' he told  
the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But just in case, the Fed plans to stockpile an extra $200  
billion in cash, about one third more than usual. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know we have enough currency to meet any conceivable  
demand,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said Americans' money will be safe in financial  
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's almost no conceivable way ... that computers will  
break down and records of people's savings accounts would 
disappear,'' he said. ``There's, fortunately, so many checks and 
balances that if it's knocked out one place, it's available in 20 
others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said the ``overwhelming majority'' of U.S. banks have  
made ``impressive progress'' in ensuring their computer systems are 
rid of codes that would read the year '00 as 1900 rather than 2000. 
Regulators are following up with the small minority who have fallen 
behind, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Fed will make cash available, he urged people to  
think twice before ``taking it out and waving it around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Walking around with a lot of $100 bills is not the safest  
thing,'' he said. ``There's going to be an awful lot of people who 
are going to be pretty interested in that.''

<HEADLINE> Check to Jones Deposited With Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- President Clinton's $850,000 check to  
settle the Paula Jones sexual harassment case against him has been 
deposited with a federal court in Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright on Tuesday also set a  
May 3 hearing in a dispute between Mrs. Jones' former and current 
lawyers over how the money will be distributed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jan. 12 check was sent to a California lawyer for Mrs.  
Jones, William N. McMillan III. It was made out to Mrs. Jones, 
McMillan, the Dallas law firm of Rader, Campbell, Fisher &AMP; Pyke, 
and Virginia lawyers Joseph Cammarata and Gilbert Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Cammarata and Davis claim Mrs. Jones owes them $874,571. They  
represented Mrs. Jones between April 1994 and the summer of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	They asked to withdraw in September 1997 after Mrs. Jones did  
not want to accept a settlement offer from Clinton. She went on to 
hire the Dallas firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones sued the president in 1994, alleging he propositioned  
her at a Little Rock hotel in 1991, when he was governor of 
Arkansas. Clinton has denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright dismissed the lawsuit April 1. While Mrs. Jones was  
appealing Wright's decision, she and Clinton reached the 
settlement.

<HEADLINE> Drugs for Urinary Infection Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Researchers have found an increase in  
antibiotic-resistant infections of the urinary tract that may 
require switching drugs and treating patients for longer periods. 
</P>
<P>
	A five-year study of women with urinary-tract infections found  
more than 20 percent of the most common bacteria-causing infections 
were resistant to penicillin-type antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
	The prevalence of resistance to two other commonly used  
antibiotics, trimethoprim and trimethoprim-sulfathoxazole, also 
rose from more than 8 percent in 1992 to more than 16 percent in 
1996. Trimethoprim is marketed under brand names such as Proloprim; 
trimethoprim-sulfathoxazole is sold as Bactrim, Septra and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacterial resistance to lesser-used drugs, such as  
nitrofurantoin, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin, did not increase over 
the period, the researchers reported in today's Journal of the 
American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle-based HMO in the study, the Group Health Cooperative  
of Puget Sound, has used trimethoprim-sulfathoxazole as its 
first-line therapy for urinary infections since 1996, said 
researchers led by Dr. Kalpana Gupta of the University of 
Washington School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The lesser-used drugs may become more logical choices as  
antibiotic-resistance increases, the researchers said. Research 
suggests, at least for nitrofurantoin, that seven days of treatment 
may be needed vs. three days now generally used with 
trimethoprim-sulfathoxazole.

<HEADLINE> Internet Tax Panel In Limbo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A commission Congress created to recommend how  
to tax Internet commerce was supposed to begin meeting in December, 
but it remains in limbo because of a dispute over who got appointed 
to the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The conflict is important because the panel's work will give  
Congress and all 50 states a starting place in determining how to 
tax the fast-expanding world of online commerce in the 21st century 
-- and whether Main Street merchants who do pay taxes view that 
system as fair. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is just a real basic equity question we need to  
address,'' said Democratic Gov. Thomas Carper of Delaware, in 
Washington for an annual governors conference. 
</P>
<P>
	By law, the Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce panel  
must have eight members from private industry, eight from state and 
local governments -- including at least one from a state with no 
sales tax -- plus the secretaries of Commerce and Treasury and the 
U.S. trade representative. Instead, it has the three federal 
officials plus nine members from industry and seven from state and 
local governments, none from a state with no sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
	State and local government groups have threatened to go to court  
to block the panel from meeting unless its makeup is changed to 
comply with last fall's law. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will not be a meeting of the commission until this is  
fixed,'' said Neil Osten, who handles commerce and communications 
for the National Conference of State Legislatures. 
</P>
<P>
	The state and local government officials say they must have  
equal representation to protect a potential gold mine of tax 
revenue, even as they insist they don't want to cripple the 
Internet with heavy new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., told the governors  
Tuesday that he was working to ``get this commission under way 
without having to go through a court fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are aware of your interests and your concerns. I will try  
to help find a resolution without changing the overall makeup of 
the commission,'' Lott said. But he added: ``It's not going to wind 
up tilted the way you would like to have it, perhaps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The law, which also imposed a three-year moratorium on new  
Internet taxes, set the three federal members in stone. But because 
the White House and congressional leaders didn't communicate, the 
rest of the appointments -- made by the administration and both 
parties in Congress amid heavy lobbying by the online industry -- 
didn't follow the law. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the private industry appointees -- which include Netscape  
chief James Barksdale and AT&AMP;T Chairman Mike Armstrong -- has 
offered to step aside, and no politician has the stomach to ask 
such figures to depart. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very, very hard thing to take a name back,'' Osten  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another option would be to reopen the law to change the  
membership, but that could enable lawmakers to offer other 
amendments. Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., is already trying to make the 
law's tax moratorium permanent. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Rhodes, legislative director for the U.S. Internet Council,  
called the dispute ``a minor issue that should be easily corrected. 
I don't think it will poison the well.''

<HEADLINE> Barnes &AMP; Noble's Stock Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc.'s stock fell nearly 13  
percent on Tuesday after the giant bookseller warned of 
lower-than-expected profits for its last fiscal year and slower 
earnings growth in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based company, which released its forecast late  
Monday, expects to report earnings of 76 cents a share for the year 
ended in January, below the 80 cents that Wall Street analysts' had 
anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	The estimates were based on its retail operations and  
money-losing Internet business, barnesandnoble.com. Excluded is a 
gain of 53 cents a share from German media conglomerate Bertelsmann 
AG's purchase of a 50 percent stake in barnesandnoble.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in Barnes &AMP; Noble fell $4.56 1/4 to $31.18 3/4 in trading on  
the New York Stock Exchange. It is scheduled to report its earnings 
on or around March 11. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also said that earnings from its stores will rise  
between 14 percent and 17 percent in the year ending next January, 
below the 25 percent gain that many analysts had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes &AMP; Noble will slow the pace that it opens new superstores  
and will close more of its underperforming mall stores than 
expected, said Amy Ryan, a retail analyst at Prudential Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, it will spend $15 million to install new technology  
in its stores that will allow customers to access all of the titles 
they find on the Internet. The growing popularity of selling books 
online has stripped sales away from its retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the forecast, Barnes &AMP; Noble said sales at  
superstores open at least a year rose 5 percent for the year and 
4.7 percent in the fourth quarter. Same-store sales at B. Dalton 
stores, which are smaller and usually found in malls, declined 1.4 
percent for the year and 2.6 percent in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales at barnesandnoble.com climbed 381 percent last year to  
$70.2 million. While its sales were better-than-expected, it still 
lagged behind the $609 million in sales at No. 1 online bookseller 
Amazon.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the company filed for an initial public offering of  
barnesandnoble.com, but it was delayed after Bertelsmann bought a 
50 percent stake in the site for $200 million. Analysts said an IPO 
is likely this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes &AMP; Noble is also awaiting approval from the Federal Trade  
Commission on its $600 million bid for Ingram Book Group, the 
largest U.S. book distributor to retailers that would allow Barnes 
&AMP; Noble to deliver books faster and more cost-effectively.

<HEADLINE> Skier Jim Moran's Condition Improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) -- Former U.S. Olympic freestyle ski team  
member Jim Moran showed improvement Tuesday, three days after he 
suffered a severe head injury during a competition at Vail. 
</P>
<P>
	Moran remained on a respirator and slightly sedated to give his  
body a chance to heal, according to physicians at Swedish Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim's vital signs are stable, but he remains in critical  
condition,'' said Dr. John McVicker, a neurosurgeon. ``However, we 
are seeing improvement every day and feel it's too early to comment 
on his recovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moran, 26, was injured when he landed after an aerial spin at  
the U.S. Freeskiing Open Saturday and was air-lifted to the 
hospital that day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eyewitness accounts report Jim was wearing a helmet and we can  
attribute that to saving his life,'' McVicker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moran left the U.S. team after finishing 23rd in the moguls  
competition in the Nagano Olympics. He skied to two World Cup 
moguls victories, a 1993 event in Breckenridge and a 1996 
competition in Altenmarkt, Austria.

<HEADLINE> Navy Hoping To Land NCAA Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP)-- Traditional powers like Duke and North  
Carolina expect to go to the NCAA Tournament every March. But for 
teams like Navy, a tournament trip is an accomplishment, and two 
straight is really something special. 
</P>
<P>
	The Midshipmen (20-6) will travel to West Point, N.Y. this  
weekend in search of their third consecutive Patriot League 
Tournament championship. Only Valparaiso and three-time Ivy League 
champ Princeton have more consecutive conference titles than Navy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to win our tournament,'' said Navy Coach Don DeVoe,  
who conceded that the Patriot League is ``light years away'' from 
having one of its teams get an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you win 20 games I feel you should get some  
consideration,'' for either an at-large NCAA bid or an NIT berth, 
DeVoe said, adding that he's not sure the Midshipmen will get a nod 
from either. 
</P>
<P>
	So Navy will have to get it done this weekend. The Midshipmen  
face Lehigh -- 5-21 and winless since mid-December -- on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Should they prevail and survive other opening round games, they  
would face Bucknell in the semifinals on Sunday. Navy and Bucknell 
split two regular season meetings. A win on Sunday would send Navy 
to the conference finals the following Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want a shot at whoever wants a shot against us,'' said  
sophomore swingman Chris Williams. ``It doesn't matter. It's not an 
`if'; we're going to win this tournament, and have another fun time 
in the field of 64.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senior captain Skip Victor is thinking about a legacy.  
</P>
<P>
	``It would be real special to get back for the third year in a  
row. You start to build a tradition, and make a name for 
yourselves,'' Victor said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would sort of be like Princeton. You go back a couple  
times, and then you get enough confidence to win one. Then people 
don't just think `Here's Princeton,' they think `How many games can 
Princeton win?' It would be good to have them think that way about 
Navy,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Court Hears Religion Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- When a 10-year-old Paraguayan boy adopted by an  
Israeli family was told he might have to undergo another conversion 
to Judaism, this time by the ultra-Orthodox Rabbinical Courts, he 
ran and hid under his bed, his father said. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy had already been converted by a rabbi from the  
Conservative movement, a more liberal stream of Judaism, and his 
parents felt that was good enough for them. 
</P>
<P>
	Their battle against an Orthodox conversion is at the heart of a  
landmark case before Israel's Supreme Court. The clash pits the 
country's Orthodox religious establishment against the Conservative 
and Reform movements -- and has driven a wedge between Israel and 
world Jewry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court resumed debate Tuesday on a 1995 petition by  
two families who adopted non-Jewish children abroad and had them 
converted by Conservative rabbis in Israel. The families opted for 
Conservative conversions because Orthodox rabbis would only convert 
the children if their families first adopted Orthodox lifestyles, 
including adhering to dietary laws and observing the Jewish 
Sabbath. 
</P>
<P>
	But the conversions were not recognized by the Interior  
Ministry, meaning the children are not listed in a national 
registry as Jews -- something the families want changed. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Reform and Conservative Jews far outnumber Orthodox  
Jews in the United States, in Israel the two liberal movements have 
less than 40,000 members and are not officially recognized. 
Attempts to undermine the liberal streams in Israel, have angered 
American Jews, who have threatened to cut off funding. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court repeatedly postponed the case of the adopted  
children, hoping that Israel's parliament would find a solution. 
But attempts at compromise have failed. 
</P>
<P>
	The family of the 10-year-old boy, whose identity has been  
withheld by the court, recently rejected an offer by Orthodox 
rabbis to reconvert their son if the family agreed to follow a less 
strict set of religious guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	The liberal streams have fought in court and in parliament for  
greater recognition in Israel, triggering a backlash by the 
Orthodox, who have staged protest rallies and submitted legislation 
seeking to encode their dominant role into law. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Ehud Bandel, leader of the Conservative movement in  
Israel, contends a rally by 250,000 ultra-Orthodox Jews last week 
against the Supreme Court's rulings was partly intended to 
intimidate the judges hearing Tuesday's case. 
</P>
<P>
	In its response Tuesday, the state suggested Israel's Jewish  
character would be eroded if the Supreme Court ruled in favor of 
the adoptive families. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rabbi Reuven Hammer, who oversees conversions by the  
Conservative movement in Israel, said religious freedom was at 
stake. 
</P>
<P>
	``In every other country in the world, the conversions that we  
do are perfectly alright,'' Hammer said. ``Only in the state of 
Israel is there an attempt to say that there is one group alone, 
the Chief Rabbinate, which has the monopoly on these kinds of 
conversions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Searching for a compromise, Chief Justice Aharon Barak suggested  
the children's' nationalities be listed as ``Jews'' in the Interior 
Ministry's registry, but their religious affiliations be left 
blank. 
</P>
<P>
	The families rejected that proposal and the state has until the  
next, as yet unscheduled, hearing to respond.

<HEADLINE> Sens. Review Independent Counsel Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Spawned by Watergate but increasingly attacked  
by lawmakers of both parties, the law that gave Independent Counsel 
Kenneth Starr his job is in for a major overhaul if it survives at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've either got to fix it or drop it and look for another  
mechanism,'' said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., a principal author of 
the 1978 statute intended to take the politics out of investigating 
high-ranking officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of a Senate committee opening hearings on Wednesday  
into whether to renew or kill the Independent Counsel Act agrees - 
and even he isn't convinced of the need for such a law. Sens. Mitch 
McConnell, R-Ky., and Chris Dodd, D-Conn., were more blunt Tuesday, 
calling for the law's demise. 
</P>
<P>
	Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Fred Thompson, R-Tenn.,  
has said that he knows of no way to adequately fix the law before 
it expires June 30, but he's holding hearings to double-check. 
</P>
<P>
	Battered by years of criticism first by Republican  
administrations under investigation, and now by Democrats in the 
wake of Starr's five-year investigation of President Clinton, the 
statute has few fans on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the law's problems, Thompson told reporters Tuesday, are  
the tendency of prosecutors under public pressure to deliver a 
``rougher justice'' to some officials, and to get ``more involved 
in the impeachment process'' than is appropriate. Pressed on 
whether he was referring to Starr's investigation of Clinton 
specifically, Thompson declined to answer. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, the panel's ranking  
Democrat, is one of the few lawmakers willing to give change a try. 
But even he admits having no ideas how to accomplish that goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have more questions than answers,'' Lieberman said this week  
in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The law requires the attorney general to seek the appointment of  
an independent counsel when there is substantial and credible 
evidence of a crime by any one of 49 top federal officials, 
including the president. A panel of three federal judges then picks 
an attorney for the job. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor has an unlimited budget to hire aides and  
investigate his target -- a frequent point of criticism. Starr has 
spent nearly $50 million on the Clinton investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	With approval from the attorney general and the appointing  
judges, the independent counsel can broaden investigations far 
beyond the original mandate, another target of the law's critics. 
Starr's mandate, for example, began with inquiries into Clinton's 
land deals and widened repeatedly, finally to the Monica Lewinsky 
scandal that led to his impeachment and trial. The Senate acquitted 
Clinton Feb. 12 on the two articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	But Congress' frosty regard for the law began when Starr was  
still on the bench of the U.S. Court of Appeals in the 1980s. 
Republicans were the first to complain of the law's abuse during 
Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh's seven-year Iran-Contra 
investigation. The controversy prompted Congress to let the law 
lapse for 18 months during the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, it was Clinton who successfully campaigned for the  
law's renewal in 1994. Two years ago, already under investigation 
by Starr, Clinton said that the law's costs had outweighed the 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart told reporters Tuesday  
that ``there seems to be a bipartisan consensus that the 
independent counsel statute, as written, needs a very serious look 
and some reforms if it's to be reauthorized. ... We agree with that 
consensus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what kind of reforms, he said: ``We haven't come to any  
firm conclusions here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Deputy U.S. Attorney Eric Holder told reporters that  
the Justice Department also wants Congress to ``tinker'' with the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one issue on which the Republicans were right, and we  
were just wrong,'' Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said last fall. 
``The independent counsel statute is dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House and Senate committees plan to hold hearings that could  
last well into the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as they prepared to get under way, Starr's role was an  
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson told The Associated Press on Tuesday that Starr  
probably won't appear before the committee before April. 
</P>
<P>
	But in an effort to keep the proceedings from becoming a  
referendum on Starr, Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., who will head the 
House subcommittee hearings on the law, has refused to do so. 
Gekas, chairman of the Judiciary Committee's panel on commercial 
and administrative law, plans to open the hearings on March 2 with 
testimony from Holder, a GOP source said on condition of anonymity.

<HEADLINE> Garciaparra Is Now Red Sox Top Star </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Even following Mo Vaughn's departure,  
Nomar Garciaparra doesn't expect his role to change. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anybody can take Mo's spot,'' Garciaparra said  
Tuesday, the day before Boston's first full-squad workout. 
``Everybody has the same personality they had. Nobody's going to 
change. There's no need to change and you come out here, you 
prepare yourself for the season and you take on the season like any 
other year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn, who hit .337 with 40 homers and 115 RBIs, may be talked  
about more by Red Sox fans this spring than the players he left 
behind when he signed an $80 million, six-year deal with Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mo's over there,'' Garciaparra said. ``I'm sure he's worried  
about the team he's on now and trying to help them win the World 
Series and we're doing the same thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra, who hit .323 with 35 homers and 122 RBIs in his  
second season as Boston's shortstop, became the team's undisputed 
offensive leader following Vaughn's departure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think about it,'' he said. ``I'm not going to change  
myself. I've still got a job to do. That's my main concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra is one of just five players to hit at least 30  
homers in each of his first two major league seasons and finished 
second in the AL MVP voting last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure he'll handle whatever comes his way to the best of  
his ability,'' manager Jimy Williams said. ``You can't please 
everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just like last year, forecasters are discounting the Red Sox as  
a playoff threat. Boston wound up with the second-best record in 
the league behind the New York Yankees, so Garciaparra scoffs at 
predictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why am I going to waste my energy on that when I know what's  
going on myself,'' he said. ``I don't need somebody else to tell me 
who's outside looking in.''

<HEADLINE> Purdue Back on Top in Women's Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Purdue once again was the beneficiary of a Tennessee loss.  
</P>
<P>
	For the second time this season, Tennessee fell out of the No. 1  
spot in The Associated Press women's basketball poll. And for the 
second time, Purdue replaced the Lady Vols at the top. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue returned to No. 1 on Monday, one day after Tennessee  
suffered a 72-69 loss at LSU. The Boilermakers gained their 
first-ever No. 1 ranking in the second poll of the season after 
beating Tennessee in their opener, but they lasted only one week in 
that spot. 
</P>
<P>
	While coach Carolyn Peck wouldn't mind staying there a little  
longer this time -- there are only two more polls this season -- she 
insisted that's not her team's primary concern. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I said in November, it's a tremendous honor to be ranked  
No. 1 and it's a real tribute to the commitment by our 16 
players,'' Peck said. ``But the ranking is not going to help us 
score any points or come up with any steals. Our focus is on the 
Big Ten tournament, where everyone is 0-0.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue (25-1) received 38 of 41 first-place votes and 1,021  
points from a national media panel. Tennessee (25-2) slipped to 
second with one first-place vote and 973 points. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fourth time this season the lead has changed hands.  
The poll has not seen that many changes at No. 1 since there were 
four in the 1992-93 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee, winner of the last three national championships, was  
No. 1 in the preseason poll. Then came Purdue, which lost at 
Stanford by one point less than a week later and was replaced at 
No. 1 by Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut held the lead for seven weeks before a loss to  
Tennessee sent the Lady Vols back to the top. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee routed Memphis by 74 points and Vanderbilt by 36  
before stumbling at LSU, the Lady Vols' first loss to a 
Southeastern Conference team since the 1997 league tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other change in the Top 10 was a switch in positions by  
No. 9 Virginia Tech and No. 10 Notre Dame. There were few big 
changes in the rest of the list expect for LSU's jump from 23rd to 
17th. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana Tech (22-2) held at No. 3 with one first-place vote  
and 951 points, while No. 4 Colorado State (27-1) received its 
first-ever vote for No. 1 and had 893 points. Old Dominion was 
fifth, followed by Connecticut, Rutgers, Duke, Virginia Tech and 
Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Tech remained 11th, UCLA climbed one spot to 12th and  
North Carolina slipped one place to 13th after losing to Duke. Then 
it was Georgia, Penn State, Clemson and LSU, followed by Oregon, 
Virginia and Iowa State. 
</P>
<P>
	The final five were UC Santa Barbara, Kansas, Auburn, Alabama  
and Florida International. 
</P>
<P>
	LSU's move of six places was the biggest jump in the poll. The  
biggest drop was just two places -- by Clemson (14th to 16th), 
Virginia (17th to 19th) and Florida International (23rd to 25th). 
</P>
<P>
	Clemson fell despite beating Wake Forest in its only game and  
Virginia dropped after winning twice. Florida International lost to 
Western Kentucky in its only game of the week.

<HEADLINE> Rickey Henderson in Mets Camp Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (AP) -- Rickey Henderson didn't just show up  
on time, he arrived early. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's good for them, it's good for me,'' the career steals  
leader said Tuesday after working out with the New York Mets for 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson, 40, was known for showing up after the voluntary  
reporting date in his younger days, which infuriated the Oakland 
Athletics more than once. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think most people during my years have always said Rickey  
comes to spring training late,'' Henderson said. ``But we were 
always scheduled a week in advance for the guys to come back from 
the East Coast, who had the bad weather, to give them a chance to 
get a head start. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was always in California and always came to camp in tip-top  
shape. The week wasn't going to do anything for me. The press was 
always going to blow it out. I was always there; they never had to 
find me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Bonilla also showed up early, just in time to celebrate  
his 36th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel strong,'' said Bonilla, largely a disappointment when  
he was with the Mets from 1992-95. ``I feel great. It's going to be 
fun for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a morning session in the batting cage, both players hit  
live against Mets first-base coach Mookie Wilson. Henderson hit 
crisp line drives from the beginning of the session and Bonilla hit 
several balls over the fence. 
</P>

	``I don't necessarily think they need to be here early to show  
us anything, they just want to be here and that's great,'' Mets 
manager Bobby Valentine said. ``They came, they mixed with the 
guys, they had great enthusiasm, talked a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine also took notice that both players reported to camp in

</P>
<P>
	``I think they've been in long enough to know what messages are  
supposed to be sent by their presence, and I think they wanted to 
send the right message and I think they did,'' Valentine said. ``I

Florida and Los Angeles.

	``I know Bobby Bo has worked very hard this winter,'' general  
manager Steve Phillips said. ``Our strength and conditioning coach 
almost lived at his house and worked him over pretty good. Rickey 
is in phenomenal shape and we're pleased with how he's come in.''

<HEADLINE> MLS Boots Deputy Commissioner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sunil Gulati, the deputy commissioner of Major  
League Soccer, was removed Tuesday for his unilateral decision to 
renew the contract of midfielder Tab Ramos with the New York/New 
Jersey MetroStars. 
</P>
<P>
	MLS commissioner Doug Logan announced the change but would not  
discuss the reasons for it. Gulati's responsibilities were 
reassigned to Ivan Gazidis, executive vice president of player 
relations and operations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gulati, reached at his home, had no comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Gulati has been a key figure in U.S. soccer, both as the  
league's No. 2 official and as the top aide to 1994 World Cup head 
Alan Rothenberg. He arranges international player transfers and at 
times has done international scheduling for the U.S. Soccer 
Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	In the MLS, all players sign contracts with the league and are  
assigned to teams, with Gulati playing the most prominent role in 
the decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Gulati's move to exercise the option year on Ramos' three-year  
contract at the league maximum salary of $250,000 apparently 
angered MetroStars' official Stuart Subotnick, said a league 
source, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	For salary cap reasons, the MetroStars felt the deal  
necessitated the trades of two popular players, goalkeeper Tony 
Meola and defender Alexi Lalas, to Kansas City last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramos, a key member of the United States' last three World Cup  
teams, was the first player ever signed by MLS. However, he was 
sidelined much of the last two seasons with knee injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The MLS board of governors, chaired by Subotnick, met for four  
hours in Dallas on Monday to discuss Gulati, who reportedly had the 
support of Philip Anschutz, owner of the Colorado Rapids, Chicago 
Fire and Los Angeles Galaxy; and Lamar Hunt, owner of the Columbus 
Crew and Wizards.

<HEADLINE> Internet To Show Live Surgery Demo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than 300 miles from his operating room in  
Ohio, a physician in Washington will demonstrate, during live 
surgery on Wednesday, how the next generation of the Internet might 
help doctors in one city work with patients elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers planned to unveil their $500 million Abilene Network,  
the new super-fast data pipeline linking more than three dozen 
research universities nationwide at speeds 45,000 times faster than 
the best telephone modems people now use to surf the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-speed computer connection, named after an important  
railhead founded in the 1860s in Kansas, is faster, at 2.4 gigabits 
per second, than all but a few highly experimental federal 
government networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately financed by corporations and run by a nonprofit group  
based in Washington, its use is limited to academics and other 
professional researchers, with no way to let home users dial into 
Abilene. But experts anticipate benefits will trickle down to 
consumers within just a few years. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Jerry Johnson, who will be at Washington's Union Station  
rail terminal, will collaborate Wednesday night with a surgical 
team at Ohio State University's hospital as they perform 
laparoscopic surgery, snaking a miniature video camera within a 
volunteer patient suffering from a gastrointestinal disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, a doctor and researcher at Ohio State, will talk with  
his colleagues using wireless microphones and a video camera, with 
the words and pictures transmitted across the high-speed Internet 
lines. More than 300 invited people will be able to peer into the 
patient's abdomen on huge screens, see the surgeons as they work in 
Ohio and ask them questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This certainly paves the way for the future,'' said John  
Linkous, director for the Washington-based American Telemedicine 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson won't perform the surgery himself from Washington,  
although researchers say that will certainly be feasible one day 
using robotic technology. But organizers call the network's debut a 
harbinger for extraordinary advancements in telemedicine, 
education, tornado forecasting and even entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, when plans for Abilene were announced  
last year, predicted: ``We will unleash breakthroughs that will 
power American industry for years to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Remote surgery, especially, simply isn't feasible using today's  
Internet, in part because of the potential for gridlock caused by 
the enormous flow of other data -- from Web sites, office jokes 
circulated via e-mail and computer games played across the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem, as described by Stephen Wolff of Cisco Systems  
Inc., is: ``Can a surgery and multi-player Doom coexist on a 
network?'' Cisco supplied about $5 million worth of high-tech 
plumbing for the network. 
</P>
<P>
	To avoid those Internet traffic jams, hospitals typically resort  
to expensive closed-circuit video systems beamed over a satellite 
link, essentially renting their own expressway to guarantee their 
data arrive on time. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kind of video signals our surgeons need to see clearly, to  
have accurate detail, true color, which is really important -- you 
couldn't send that over the existing Internet now,'' Johnson said. 
``It requires that good data pipe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the next generation of the Internet promises a revolutionary  
advantage, even beyond its jaw-slackening speed: The network will 
prioritize data to deliver the most important material first, such 
as the video image from a heart surgery. E-mail jokes would follow 
much later. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purpose of Abilene and the advanced Internet is to develop  
that capability, to characterize the high-priority traffic,'' said 
Wolff, Cisco's executive director for advanced Internet 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things less demanding, with a lower priority, will take a  
little bit longer. But mostly people won't notice a three- to 
four-second delay in the delivery of e-mail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers also will use the network Wednesday to let about a  
dozen high school students studying paleontology in Dekalb County, 
Georgia, talk across a video link with dinosaur experts at the 
Smithsonian Institution in Washington.

<HEADLINE> Intel Demonstrates Speedy New Chip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Intel Corp. said it passed a key technology  
milestone Tuesday, demonstrating a speedy new microprocessor that 
lets ordinary home computers easily respond to human voices and 
master other advanced features. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, the world's largest maker of chips for PCs, said it will  
mass-produce the souped-up Pentium III chip as the brainpower for 
business machines starting late next year or early 2001. The 
company didn't say when it would make the fast microprocessors for 
home computers, but analysts expect sales in mid-2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Running at 1 gigahertz, or 1,000 megahertz, the Pentium III  
demonstrated by Intel is twice as fast as the commercially 
available version, which goes on sale Friday as the eventual 
replacement for the Pentium II. The faster speed will let Intel's 
most expensive PC chip offer more realistic 3-D games, improved 
speech recognition and other fancy features. 
</P>
<P>
	While a handful of other companies also have developed  
technology to make 1-gigahertz microprocessors, Intel is the first 
to show off such a fast general-purpose chip running software 
applications for PCs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Santa Clara, Calif. company announced the development at its  
annual conference of software developers in Palm Springs, Calif.

<HEADLINE> China Pushing For WTO Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- In a shift that could help China's drive to join  
the World Trade Organization, Beijing officials appear to be more 
interested in opening their economy to competition, a top U.S. 
official says. 
</P>
<P>
	An agreement is not close, but more officials have concluded  
that ``a more open, more competitive, more dynamic economy'' is in 
China's interest, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there may be some greater appreciation of that on the  
Chinese side,'' Summers told reporters after meeting with Premier 
Zhu Rongji. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers said intense negotiations are expected before Zhu, the  
official in charge of economic reform, visits the United States in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining the WTO would give China low-tariff access to export  
markets and shield it from one-sided trade sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	China wants to be admitted to the group as a developing country,  
a condition that would let it protect industries by retaining some 
trade barriers that industrialized countries are not permitted to 
have. 
</P>
<P>
	China is worried that a wider opening could undermine key  
industries and throw even more people out of work at a time when 
millions are being laid off in an attempt to make state companies 
profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	But Summers argued that an open economy would help China in the  
long run. What's more, the WTO would provide a neutral forum for 
settling disputes arising from the huge U.S.-China trade imbalance, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. trade deficit with China reached nearly $57 billion  
last year, second only to the gap with Japan. More open markets 
could trim the difference by letting U.S. companies try to sell 
China more goods and services. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers said he did not discuss specific market-opening  
measures, but rather briefed Zhu on the U.S. position in 
preparation for his trip. The hard bargaining will be left to U.S. 
Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, who is due in Beijing 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The stop in Beijing is the middle of an Asian tour by Summers to  
take stock of the effects of the regional financial crisis. He has 
visited Singapore and Indonesia and will go on to South Korea and 
Japan.

<HEADLINE> Olivetti Pursues Telecom Anyway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Olivetti SpA intends to pursue its $58 billion  
hostile bid for Telecom Italia, Italy's largest phone company, 
according to the communications ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberto Colaninno, the chief executive of Olivetti, informed  
Telecommunications Minister Salvatore Cardinale on Tuesday that 
Olivetti would push ahead with the attempt to acquire Telecom, the 
ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinale met with Colaninno a day after Italy's market watchdog  
agency set back Olivetti's upstart bid for a company more than five 
times its size, by ruling the bid failed to measure up to takeover 
standards. But the agency, Consob, on Tuesday left open the 
possibility that Olivetti could qualify as having a valid bid if it 
provided more detailed plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti made its offer public Saturday in a filing it had hoped  
would pre-empt Telecom from adopting a ``poison pill'' capital 
restructuring that would make a takeover prohibitively expensive. 
In Italy, once a company becomes the target of a bid deemed valid 
by Consob, it is forbidden from taking such steps. 
</P>
<P>
	Consob's ruling Monday set the stage for Telecom to launch a  
vigorous takeover defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom's chief executive Franco Bernabe could reveal the  
strategy Wednesday during a meeting with union leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	While unions worried about losing jobs in a takeover discussed  
strategy, Olivetti workers announced plans for a one-day strike on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In declaring Olivetti's weekend takeover filing inadequate,  
Consob on Monday complained that so many regulatory approvals were 
needed that financing could not be assured. It said Tuesday that 
with more details, Olivetti could have a full-fledged takeover bid. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Tuesday on Milan's stock exchange, both Telecom  
Italia and Olivetti fell 3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Home Depot Reports Strong Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Home Depot's fourth-quarter earnings surged 36 percent as  
continued strength in the housing market fueled demand for its 
home-improvement merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	The Limited, the nation's largest specialty clothing retailer,  
posted a 13 percent improvement in its latest quarterly profit, 
boosted by strength at its Express and Intimate Brands divisions. 

</P>
<P>
                           *The Home Depot    	
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta-based home improvement giant earned $418 million, or  
27 cents a share, in the final three months of 1998, up from $307 
million, or 20 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales totaled $7.26 billion for the quarter, up 27 percent from  
a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The results topped Wall Street analysts' estimates, but Home  
Depot's stock was down 93 3/4 cents at $60.56 1/4 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	An unusually warm winter in much of the country, a flurry of  
home mortgage refinancing and the overall strength of the U.S. 
economy has boosted business at home-improvement retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	For the fiscal year, Home Depot's profits totaled $1.61 billion,  
or $1.06 per share, up from $1.16 billion, 78 cents per share, in 
1997. Revenues in 1998 totaled $30.2 billion, up from $24.2 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fiscal 1998 was an outstanding year for The Home Depot,'' said  
Arthur M. Blank, president and chief executive officer. ``The 
financial performance for the year is clear evidence of our drive 
to serve the needs of more home improvement customers every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of 1998, the company operated a total of 761 stores,  
including 707 Home Depot stores and eight EXPO Design Centers in 
the United States; 43 Home Depot stores in Canada, two Home Depot 
stores in Chile, and one Home Depot store in Puerto Rico. 

</P>
<P>
                          *The Limited Inc.    	
</P>
<P>
	The Columbus, Ohio-based specialty retailer reported operating  
earnings of $250.5 million, or $1.07 a share, for the company's 
fourth quarter ended Jan. 30. That compared with $222.6 million, or 
96 cents a share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 figures exclude results from Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, a  
division that was spun off last May. Also excluded from the prior 
year comparison was a $289 million pre-tax charge related to costs 
from the closing of the Cacique division, the downsizing of Henri 
Bendel from six stores to one, and other store closings. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth-quarter sales totaled $3.25 billion, a 7 percent increase  
from the $3.05 billion recorded in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Fueling the improvement was a turnaround at Express that the  
company attributed to keeping pace with fashion trends among young 
women. 
</P>
<P>
	The Limited also drew a boost from its Intimate Brands division,  
which includes Victoria's Secret and Bath &AMP; Body Works stores. The 
Limited owns an 85 percent stake in IBI. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the company continues to struggle with its  
Limited-branded stores for women and its Structure division for 
men. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, the Limited earned $342.4 million, or $1.46 a  
share, up from $298.4 million, or $1.31 a share, a year earlier. 
Sales were $9.19 billion, a 6 percent increase from the prior 
year's total of $8.67 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Limited operates nearly 3,492 stores, including Express,  
Lerner New York, Lane Bryant, Limited Stores, Limited Too, Galyan's 
and Henri Bendel. 
</P>
<P>
	The Limited's earnings met Wall Street analysts estimates, but  
its stock closed off 31 1/4 cents at $37.18 3/4 on the New York Stock 
Exchange.

	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- A white supremacist was convicted of murder  
today and could get the death penalty for chaining a black man to a 
pickup truck and dragging him until his body was torn to pieces in 
a crime that shocked the nation with its savagery. The jury of 11 
whites and one black took less than 2 1/2 hours to reach a verdict 
against John William King in the slaying last June of James Byrd 
Jr. ``I am relieved,'' said Stella Brumley, Byrd's sister. ``That's

conflict was reached today as Serbs agreed in principle to give 
limited self-rule to majority ethnic Albanians. The agreement puts 
on hold, at least temporarily, NATO's threats to bomb Serb targets 
if they don't adopt the complex plan that would force them to 
withdraw troops from Kosovo and accept NATO peacekeepers. More 
talks were scheduled for March as a new round of violence shook the

rejecting a $450 million commercial satellite sale to a 
Chinese-controlled consortium amid concerns about valuable military 
know-how. The decision, confirmed today by senior administration 
officials, comes a week before Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright travels to Beijing for talks with Chinese leaders and amid 
congressional and executive branch probes of whether past satellite

	INNSBRUCK, Austria (AP) -- Tons of snow tumbled down upon a small  
village in the Austrian Alps today, killing at least eight people. 
It was one of dozens of avalanches to strike Central Europe as the 
region endured its worst snowfall in 50 years. The Austrian Press 
Agency said up to 30 people remained missing. Tens of thousands of 
travelers were stranded in train stations, traffic jams and 
isolated resort towns across France, Italy, Switzerland and Austria 
as the avalanches buried homes, roads and railways. At least 59 
people have died in Alpine avalanches across Europe this winter.

Gingrich. The only suspense for front-runner Johnny Isakson was 
whether he would get a majority of the vote in the seven-way race

campaign, which seeks to educate families on obtaining coverage 
under Medicaid and the new Children's Health Insurance Program. The 
goal is to enroll the millions of children thought to be eligible.

<HEADLINE>  Philadelphians Want Ricky Williams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- No knock on Philadelphia or the Eagles, but  
Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams wants to go to the Cleveland 
Browns because they have the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ideally, I want to be the No. 1 pick, but if I'm not, I'm  
extremely comfortable coming here,'' Williams said. ``After meeting 
coach (Andy) Reid, I'm really comfortable with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said Tuesday night that he wants to play in a city that  
wants him. Philadelphia ought to fit that requirement quite nicely. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Edward G. Rendell said interest in Williams has eclipsed  
all other issues on the minds of the citizens he meets. He said 
people no longer ask him about tax cuts, the upcoming election, or 
other issues mayors usually get asked about. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only question I've gotten from the people of the city of  
Philadelphia for the last six weeks is, 'Are we going to draft 
Ricky Williams?''' Rendell said at Tuesday night's banquet held by 
the Maxwell Football Club. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA record-breaking running back from Texas could return to  
Philadelphia in the near future, since the Eagles hold the No. 2 
pick in the upcoming NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just wants to play football,'' said Sandy Williams, Ricky's  
mother, accepting the Maxwell Award for college player of the year 
on his behalf. ``Ricky can adapt to any situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday, Randall Cunningham spoke as the club honored  
him as Pro Football Player of the Year, giving him the Bert Bell 
Award for the third time. He led the Minnesota Vikings to a 15-1 
regular season while throwing 34 touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past I didn't really appreciate when I received an  
award,'' Cunningham said. ``I was young and immature and took it 
for granted. But this is a great honor. I've grown and now have the 
maturity to accept it and know what it's all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham, 35, who previously won the Bert Bell in 1988 and

<HEADLINE> Federal Stem Cell Tests To Proceed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal scientists will continue planning  
research using human stem cells despite arguments by members of 
Congress that the studies would violate a federal ban, the 
secretary of health and human services says. 
</P>
<P>
	Donna Shalala, the HHS secretary, said Tuesday that she believes  
the federal law permits the study of cultured human stem cells even 
though the cells were originally obtained from human embryos. 
</P>
<P>
	``The law allows stem cell research,'' Shalala told a Senate  
Appropriations subcommittee that oversees HHS spending. ``We intend 
to move forward in a careful, deliberative process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., the subcommittee chairman and a  
supporter of stem cell research, asked if new legislation were 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't believe a change in law is necessary,'' Shalala said.  
</P>
<P>
	Stem cells are basic biological building blocks. One type,  
called pluripotent stem cells, have the ability to create any organ 
or any tissue. Scientists say that by guiding the growth of these 
cells, it might be possible to grow new organs to replace ailing 
hearts, or neurons to treat brain disease or injury, or 
insulin-producing cells to cure diabetes. Privately funded 
researchers recently, for the first time, isolated pluripotent stem 
cells from human embryos and fetuses. The cells are now maintained 
in laboratory cultures. 
</P>
<P>
	Shalala's statement contradicts contentions by some lawmakers.  
</P>
<P>
	A letter signed by 70 House members and sent to Shalala last  
week argued that any government-funded research using human stem 
cells would violate a federal ban because the cells originated from 
human embryos. A letter signed last week by seven senators made 
similar objections. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1996 law specifically forbids federal funding of research in  
which human embryos are created or destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawmakers' letters followed the January announcement by Dr.  
Harold Varmus, head of the National Institutes of Health, that the 
ban did not cover stem cells living in a laboratory culture. He 
said the NIH was planning to finance stem cell research. 
</P>
<P>
	Shalala wrote to Rep. Jay Dickey, R-Ark., first signer of the  
House letter, that the ban applies only to research in which human 
embryos are destroyed or discarded, but ``not to research preceding 
or following such research projects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been advised that there is nothing in the legislative  
history to suggest that the provision was intended to prohibit 
funding for research in which embryos ... are not involved,'' she 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The House members' letter had contended the ban applied to any  
research ``which follows or depends upon the destruction of or 
injury to a human embryo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dickey spokesman Rod Johnson said the congressman had not yet  
seen Shalala's letter and had no immediate comment.

<HEADLINE>  Philadelphians Want Ricky Williams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- No knock on Philadelphia or the Eagles, but  
Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams wants to go to the Cleveland 
Browns because they have the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ideally, I want to be the No. 1 pick, but if I'm not, I'm  
extremely comfortable coming here,'' Williams said. ``After meeting 
coach (Andy) Reid, I'm really comfortable with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said Tuesday night that he wants to play in a city that  
wants him. Philadelphia ought to fit that requirement quite nicely. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Edward G. Rendell said interest in Williams has eclipsed  
all other issues on the minds of the citizens he meets. He said 
people no longer ask him about tax cuts, the upcoming election, or 
other issues mayors usually get asked about. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only question I've gotten from the people of the city of  
Philadelphia for the last six weeks is, 'Are we going to draft 
Ricky Williams?''' Rendell said at Tuesday night's banquet held by 
the Maxwell Football Club. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA record-breaking running back from Texas could return to  
Philadelphia in the near future, since the Eagles hold the No. 2 
pick in the upcoming NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just wants to play football,'' said Sandy Williams, Ricky's  
mother, accepting the Maxwell Award for college player of the year 
on his behalf. ``Ricky can adapt to any situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday, Randall Cunningham spoke as the club honored  
him as Pro Football Player of the Year, giving him the Bert Bell 
Award for the third time. He led the Minnesota Vikings to a 15-1 
regular season while throwing 34 touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past I didn't really appreciate when I received an  
award,'' Cunningham said. ``I was young and immature and took it 
for granted. But this is a great honor. I've grown and now have the 
maturity to accept it and know what it's all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham, 35, who previously won the Bert Bell in 1988 and  
1990, joined Baltimore Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas as the only 
three-time winners of the award. He said returning to Philadelphia, 
where he spent his first 11 seasons, made it special. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other award winners cited by the Maxwell Club were  
Texas A&AMP;M linebacker Dat Nguyen, who won the Chuck Bednarik Award 
as Defensive Player of the Year; Tennessee's Phil Fullmer, who 
guided the Vols to a perfect season and the national championship, 
was named George Munger College Coach of the Year; and Dennis

leading Cunningham and the Vikings to the NFL's best record.

<HEADLINE> DirecTV Promises Fox, CBS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's largest satellite TV company,  
DirecTV Inc., said Tuesday that its customers will continue to get 
CBS and Fox this Sunday, because the company will beam down the 
network programs in a way it contends doesn't violate a federal 
court order. 
</P>
<P>
	The company believes it can legally offer the CBS and Fox  
affiliates because the court order with the Sunday deadline applies 
only to DirecTV's former programming supplier, said DirecTV 
president Eddy Hartenstein. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was the latest twist in an ongoing fight  
between satellite TV companies and broadcasters over how customers 
who get their TV from satellite can watch networks' local 
affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Broadcasters said it is considering  
legal action against DirecTV. Fox called DirecTV's action a 
``flagrant violation'' of the court order and is considering suing 
DirecTV to stop it from carrying Fox programming, said senior vice 
president Peggy Binzel. CBS officials had no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law allows DirecTV and other satellite companies to  
provide ``distant'' network signals -- which come from other 
broadcast areas -- to customers only if those customers can't 
receive their local TV stations using rooftop antennas. 
</P>
<P>
	And, that's where the dispute is occurring. The satellite and  
broadcasting industries have been at odds for years over how to 
interpret an arcane legal test for determining when a satellite 
customer can't get a local signal. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with DirecTV's action, several hundred thousand satellite  
customers nationwide are still supposed to be cut off from Fox and 
CBS programs on Sunday, under the court order obtained by the 
networks last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning Thursday, DirecTV, based in El Segundo, Calif., plans  
to offer customers nationwide the option of buying a new package of 
broadcast network stations, including CBS' affiliate in Los Angeles 
and Fox's affiliate in New York, Hartenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartenstein contends DirecTV can legally do this because the  
court order is only against PrimeTime 24, until recently a leading 
programming provider to it and other major satellite companies such 
as EchoStar. 
</P>
<P>
	DirecTV has terminated its contract with PrimeTime 24,  
Hartenstein said. EchoStar also has ended its contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of the PrimeTime 24 package, DirecTV on its own will  
carry the CBS and Fox affiliates, along with NBC and ABC 
affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Morrisey, an attorney speaking for PrimeTime 24, said  
that while the company is ``disappointed with DirecTV's decision, 
we remain committed to our goal of providing consumers access to 
satellite network delivered programming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morrisey also indicated that he believed DirecTV's new  
arrangement could violate the court order, which affects PrimeTime 
24's distributors, even though DirecTV no longer carries PrimeTime 
24's product. 
</P>
<P>
	The two industries are now doing battle on Capitol Hill over how  
to ease the standard for when customers can get ``distant'' 
signals. The satellite industry and consumer groups want the 
standard to be based on picture quality: If a satellite customer's 
local station comes in with snow, static and other interference 
using an antenna, they should be able to get access to distant 
signals. 
</P>
<P>
	But the broadcasting industry wants the standard to stay  
virtually the same, relying on whether a satellite TV customer 
lives in the local station's coverage area. Customers who do aren't 
legally entitled to buy distant broadcast signals even if their 
over-the-air picture quality is poor. Broadcasters argue that 
beaming distant broadcast signals into local markets can hurt local 
stations' ratings and revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	John McCain, R-Ariz., whose Senate Commerce Committee is  
considering legislation on the changes, said he wants the committee 
to vote on his bill, opposed by the broadcasting industry, on March 
3. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain wants the two industries to work out an agreement that  
would ensure passage of his legislation, but said he's doubtful 
they would and pledged to move forward anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Another order by the same court, in Miami, will cut off another  
1.5 million customers from CBS and Fox signals by April 30. Both 
injunctions are against PrimeTime 24 for violating copyright law 
and do not affect NBC, ABC or other networks' affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
	Satellite TV customers, meanwhile, can contact their local CBS  
or Fox affiliate to try to obtain a waiver and continue to receive 
CBS and Fox shows on their satellite systems.

<HEADLINE> GOP Govs. Urge Bush To Run in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's governors demanded more federal  
money for state programs with no strings attached, ending a 
four-day conference Tuesday that also boosted Texas Gov. George W. 
Bush's presidential prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Bush left Washington without a formal endorsement, his  
supporters said they secured support from 13 of the 31 GOP 
governors. Three or four more could soon join in, organizers of the 
drive said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to be a few more days before we get this  
done,'' Montana Gov. Marc Racicot said. He joined forces with Govs. 
John Engler of Michigan and Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts to round 
up Bush allies, hoping to get a majority of the GOP governors 
aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush was hardly the only topic at the conference, which ended on  
an upbeat note with Democratic and Republican governors saying 
their style of bipartisanship and consensus building might be 
taking hold in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sense a new civility that may be in the air in our nation's  
capital,'' said Gov. Tom Carper, a Democrat from Delaware who is 
chairman of the National Governors' Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The governors were often united across party lines, often  
against Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	They demanded more money for education and welfare programs,  
while telling Congress and President Clinton to keep their hands 
off money that states earned in lawsuits against tobacco companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The president promised on Monday to back legislation allowing  
states to keep the tobacco money if it is spent on health and 
anti-smoking initiatives. GOP governors said they would make sure 
Clinton kept his promise. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Congress' turn Tuesday, with lawmakers from both parties  
trooping to a downtown hotel to address the governors. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said he, like  
Clinton, would support states keeping tobacco money. ``I know this 
is a burr in your saddle,'' he told them. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi promised a  
quick vote on a bill that would allow states to waive federal 
education regulations, and he said the next budget will include 
more money for schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I want is more flexibility and more money for you,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several governors complained that Washington was not giving  
states money promised for welfare and special education programs 
mandated by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the 2000 presidential situation, what started as an  
informal head count Sunday rapidly evolved into a Bush boomlet and 
could still lead to a formal endorsement in the next week or so, 
organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has yet to announce his intentions, but his advisers expect  
him to form a presidential exploratory committee next month and 
formally enter the race a few months later. The moves to support 
him reflect a desire by GOP governors to see one of their own in 
the White House, preferably a governor they supported early enough 
to earn a spot on the ticket or a Cabinet post. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll sign the sheet three times,'' said Oklahoma Gov. Frank  
Keating of the mythical endorsement list. 
</P>
<P>
	``They like him. They trust him,'' Racicot said. ``They think he  
can win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush told reporters that he didn't coordinate the effort.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't come here and say, `Well, gosh, let's round up a  
bunch of governors.''' The governors who coordinated the effort 
said they received Bush's permission to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	At least two governors, Mike Huckabee of Arkansas and Don  
Sundquist of Tennessee, support Lamar Alexander for the 
presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Two others appeared to be leaning toward former Vice President  
Dan Quayle and one was expected to back Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. 
The others are uncommitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's political advisers believe he will eventually be endorsed  
by two-thirds of the GOP governors.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Exec Questioned Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A government attorney tried to chip away at  
the credibility of a Microsoft executive on Tuesday, getting him to 
acknowledge the software giant offered rival Netscape 
Communications ``several inducements'' to stop competing in the 
Internet browser market. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest effort against Microsoft's defense came during  
further cross-examination of Dan Rosen, the company's general 
manager for new technology. At one point, Justice Department 
attorney David Boies accused Rosen of making up his answers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosen is a key witness because he was present at a disputed June  
21, 1995 meeting between Netscape and Microsoft officials. The 
government claims Microsoft offered to split the Internet browser 
market with Netscape, which dominated the market at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft is accused of threatening to ``crush'' Netscape if it  
continued selling its browser on computers using newer versions of 
Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosen has denied repeatedly that Microsoft ever threatened  
Netscape, but he acknowledged ``we offered them several inducements 
if they adopted several of our technologies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rosen said Microsoft simply tried to provide technological tools  
that would have allowed Netscape to make its Web browser compatible 
with Windows 95, an operating system that runs on more than 90 
percent of all personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosen also was questioned about the first time he tried to  
obtain Netscape's browser for computers that used Windows 95. 
</P>
<P>
	He first told Boies it was sometime in July 1995 -- more than a  
month after the June 21 meeting. That answer, however, drew a 
challenge from the government. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't remember that, do you, sir? You're just making that  
up,'' Boies said. Rosen adamantly denied it. 
</P>
<P>
	But then Boies presented two one-line e-mail messages Rosen  
wrote to his colleagues. The first, dated April 27, 1995, asked 
``Do you remember who took the Netscape Win95 browser that they 
gave us during our last meeting? I'd like to get a copy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the second message, dated May 11, Rosen asks: ``Can I  
borrow/copy the Netscape Win95 new (browser) they gave us?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I stand corrected,'' Rosen responded, after seeing the  
documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosen said he never actually got the browser, which was a test  
version that did not work properly. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also raised questions about Rosen's Monday  
testimony over the disputed Netscape meeting. And as he testified 
Monday, the judge who will decide the verdict rolled his eyes and 
sometimes shook his head at Rosen's answers. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Rosen took the stand Tuesday to be questioned by  
Microsoft's own attorney, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield 
Jackson told Microsoft lawyer Michael Lacovara: ``It is always 
inspiring to watch young people embark on heroic endeavors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government on Tuesday also began its cross-examination of  
Eric Engstrom, who ran Microsoft's audio and video software. 
Engstrom is expected to deny charges that Microsoft tried to 
sabotage multimedia software made by Apple Computer after that 
company refused to go along with Microsoft's alleged plan to 
``carve up the market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In written testimony submitted to the court last week prior to  
taking the stand, Engstrom said Microsoft never urged Apple to stop 
selling QuickTime, a popular software product that lets people hear 
audio and watch video across the Internet. The product competes 
directly with Microsoft's Netshow and Media player. 
</P>
<P>
	The claims of sabotage were made by Avadis Tevanian, a senior  
Apple executive who testified earlier in the trial.

<HEADLINE> '60 Minutes' Plans ALS Follow-Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After hearing from angry viewers, CBS's ``60  
Minutes'' will present an alternative to Dr. Jack Kevorkian. 
</P>
<P>
	This Sunday, the newsmagazine will do a follow-up story about  
patients living with Lou Gehrig's disease after many of them 
complained about being demoralized when the network showed 
Kevorkian giving a lethal injection to an ALS sufferer. 
</P>
<P>
	The program sparked widespread debate about euthanasia last  
November when it aired a tape of Kevorkian administering drugs to 
Thomas Youk, a Michigan man with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS also was criticized for airing videotape of a person dying  
on prime-time television, particularly since it came during a 
``sweeps'' period when ratings are used to set advertising rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Largely unnoticed at the time was the ``furious'' reaction of  
other people with the disease, said Dr. Stan Appel, director of a 
treatment center for ALS patients at Baylor University. 
</P>
<P>
	``It angered a lot of our patients that the focus was so  
misplaced,'' Appel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Hewitt, executive producer for ``60 Minutes,'' said he and  
Mike Wallace decided to do the follow-up story after it was 
suggested to them by a caller on CNN's ``Larry King Live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's story, titled ``Choosing Life,'' will feature a handful  
of people who are living with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Viewers criticized ``60 Minutes'' because it ``never showed us  
people who made a choice other than Kevorkian,'' Hewitt said, ``and 
I thought that was a legitimate thing to show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The second story is not an indication that ``60 Minutes'' was  
having second thoughts about the Kevorkian segment, he said, nor 
does it indicate that its producers are particularly susceptible to 
public pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Lewis, host of an annual Muscular Dystrophy Association  
telethon, was among the people who wrote to Hewitt complaining 
about the Kevorkian segment. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said it ``amplified the fear'' of people who have the  
disease or who will get a diagnosis of it in the future.

<HEADLINE> Yanks Need To Fill Left Field Spot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- While other teams are filled with unsettled  
spots, the only available starting job with the New York Yankees is 
left field. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are several different directions they can go. They can  
go and pick from some good players out there,'' Chad Curtis said 
Tuesday as full-squad workouts began. ``There is competition, but 
it's not going to get in the way of the total team concept.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Curtis will be competing with Darryl Strawberry, Shane Spencer  
and Ricky Ledee, with a platoon also a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, recovering from colon-cancer surgery last October,  
returned to the field Tuesday after taking Monday off due to 
fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd like to see Strawberry out there, because that would  
mean he's heathy. That would be the sentimental thing to say,'' New 
York manager Joe Torre said. ``We'll do what we have to do. The 
important thing is we have quality to pick from ... even if you 
have a platoon situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another concern is filling the bullpen spot vacated by  
left-hander Graeme Lloyd, traded to Toronto last week with David 
Wells and Homer Bush for Roger Clemens. The Yankees are exploring 
trades and thinking about trying to lure Jimmy Key out of 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're exploring all options,'' Yankees general manager Brian  
Cashman said. ``There is nothing to report on Jimmy Key. We are 
prepared to go north with a right-hander.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Naulty has emerged as the frontrunner if the Yankees opt to  
go with just one left-handed reliever, Mike Stanton. Two non-roster 
left-handers will get looks: David Carroll, who missed Tuesday's 
workout because of flu, and Ed Yarnall.

Cashman said. ``The money is nice, but it's not always about the 
money,'' Jeter added. ``If I need money, I'll borrow from Bernie 
(Williams).' ... Center fielder Bernie Williams has been slowed by 
flu. ... Pitchers will begin throwing live batting practice 
Wednesday. The good news for hitters is Clemens is not expected to 
pitch. The five-time Cy Young Award winner will do long toss 
instead. ... The Yankees are scheduled to play intrasquad games 
March 1 and 2.

<HEADLINE> Indiana Man Freed From Arson Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMMOND, Ind. (AP) -- A man who has maintained for several years  
that he had nothing to do with the fire that killed his wife and 
four children was freed after arson charges were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Weber, 44, was released Monday after the Bureau of  
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms questioned the arson ruling by the 
state fire marshal's office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, now there will be more cooperation in trying to  
find out what happened,'' Weber said. ``I feel if these people 
would have put as much effort into working with me as they did to 
try to prove me guilty, we might have found out the truth, whether 
it be arson or accident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A request from prosecutors to dismiss the charges in the 1994  
mobile home fire in Hebron was approved by U.S. Magistrate Andrew 
Rodovich. 
</P>
<P>
	Weber's attorneys were informed by prosecutors Friday that a new  
review of the case by ATF concluded the state's arson ruling ``is 
not supported with reasonable degree of scientific certainty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, dismissal of the charges was prompted by two  
witnesses who said they saw Weber in Wisconsin in the hours before 
the fire. Weber, a truck driver, had said all along he was on the 
road in Wisconsin at the time that his wife, Marsha, and children, 
ranging from 9 months to 16 years, were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Weber called news conferences to proclaim his innocence and  
offered explanations ranging from gang activity to a police 
cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Jon DeGuilio promised a further look into the  
fire. Weber had been jailed since Dec. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do intend to conduct an aggressive investigation in the  
hopes of getting at the truth of the matter,'' DeGuilio said. He 
said ATF investigators ``are not saying it was not arson. They're 
simply questioning the way the conclusion was reached.''

<HEADLINE> HMO Breast-Cancer Treatment Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Some Medicare HMOs do a better job than  
traditional fee-for-service medicine at diagnosing and treating 
breast cancer, but quality varies tremendously from one HMO to 
another, a government study found. 
</P>
<P>
	Some policymakers have promoted health maintenance organizations  
as a way to hold costs down for Medicare recipients. Others 
believe, however, that the quality of care suffers under HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
	About 6.5 million people belong to HMOs under Medicare, the  
government health insurance program for Americans 65 and older, and 
that number is expected to grow rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study published in Wednesday's Journal of the American  
Medical Association, researchers using data from 1988 to 1993 
looked at how HMOs in 11 areas of the country compared with 
traditional fee-for-service care in diagnosing and treating breast 
cancer in Medicare patients. 
</P>
<P>
	On average, the HMO patients were less likely to have breast  
cancer diagnosed at late stages (7.6 percent among HMO patients, 
10.8 percent among those in fee-for-service care). 
</P>
<P>
	When cancer was caught early, the two types of plans were about  
equal in the rate at which they used breast-conserving surgery, or 
lumpectomy. On average, the rate was 38.4 percent in HMOs and 36.8 
percent in FFS. 
</P>
<P>
	But the rates varied wildly among HMOs, from a low of 27.1  
percent to a high of 55.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	And the use of radiation to accompany lumpectomy -- now  
considered virtually necessary for the best chance of cure -- also 
varied wildly, from a low of 49.2 percent to a high of 82.5 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In fee-for-service care, radiation accompanying lumpectomy was  
used 61.1 percent and 69 percent of the time in the geographic 
areas where the high and low rates for HMOs were found. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers did not identify the HMOs nor the areas.  
</P>
<P>
	The study was led by Gerald F. Riley of the federal Health Care  
Financing Administration, which runs Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows that people who enroll in Medicare HMOs in general do  
as well or better with respect to the care of breast cancer,'' said 
Dr. Sheldon M. Retchin, a professor of internal medicine at 
Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said he found ``more startling'' the tremendous variation  
among HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It says to me, `Somebody knows how to do this, and somebody  
doesn't,''' Retchin said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the government is working to develop guides for  
consumers to use to compare various plans. In the meantime, the 
government has an Internet address for Medicare recipients to 
review plans in their area. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> NBC Retains Lead in Sweeps Week / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A full plate of ``sweeps'' fare that included  
George Clooney's ``ER'' farewell sent television viewership soaring 
last Thursday as NBC kept its lead in the February ratings contest. 
</P>
<P>
	There were other winners last week as highly promoted sweeps  
episodes gave a number of series a ratings boost, including 
``Homicide: Life on the Street'' and ``Star Trek: Voyager.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC won the week of Feb. 15-21 with a 9.9 rating and 16 share,  
according to Nielsen Media Research figures released Tuesday. That 
keeps the network ahead, so far, in the intense period of ratings 
measurement used to set local ad rates. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS was second with a 9.5 rating and 15 share, followed by ABC  
with a 9.2 rating and 15 share. Fox earned a 6.8 rating and 11 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the emerging networks, WB had a 3.7 rating and 6 share,  
and UPN had a 2.3 rating and 4 share. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. Share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's top-rated ``ER'' said goodbye to Clooney's Dr. Doug Ross  
with the biggest audience for an episode of any regular 
entertainment series this season. Viewership was 15 percent higher 
than normal for the medical drama. 
</P>
<P>
	Other hot Thursday night programs included the final chapter of  
ABC's Stephen King miniseries ``Storm of the Century,'' and the Fox 
reality special ``World's Most Shocking Medical Videos.'' The King 
miniseries ranked 11th for the week; the Fox special was 30th. 
</P>
<P>
	Viewership rose 30 percent last Thursday over normal levels,  
said industry analyst Mark Berman of New York-based Seltel. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a sea of network erosion, if you put the right programs on  
people will tune in to the networks. Thursday was a clear example 
of that,'' Berman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other shows enjoying a sweeps dividend, ``Star Trek:  
Voyager'' posted its highest rating since October 1997 and was 
struggling UPN's highest-rated program all year with a two-hour 
episode. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Homicide'' received its best rating since November 1997  
with the conclusion of a crossover episode with ``Law &AMP; Order'' 
that took pointed jabs at a Kenneth Starr-like special prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the news programs, NBC's ``Nightly News'' posted an 8.3  
rating and 17 share to edge out ABC's ``World News Tonight,'' which 
had an 8.2 rating, 16 share. The ``CBS Evening News'' had a 7.9 
rating and 16 share. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Feb. 15-21, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were: 
</P>
<P>
	``ER,'' NBC, 23.8; ``Friends,'' NBC, 19.0; ``Frasier,'' NBC,  
18.8; ``Jesse,'' NBC, 15.9; ``Veronica's Closet,'' NBC, 15.6; ``60 
Minutes,'' CBS, 14.9; ``CBS Sunday Movie, Too Rich: The Secret Life 
of Doris Duke,'' Part 1, CBS, 14.3; ``Touched by an Angel,'' CBS, 
14.0; ``ABC Monday Night Movie: Storm of the Century,'' Part 2, 
ABC, 12.2; ``Dateline NBC-Tuesday,'' NBC, 12.2.

<HEADLINE> Applause for 'Beautiful Thing' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Caring about the characters on stage is half the  
battle, and ``Beautiful Thing'' wins the war for audience attention 
hands down. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of Act 2, you will find yourself cheering for the  
five people who populate Jonathan Harvey's gay coming-of-age drama 
set in a grim London housing project. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvey's story, on view at off-Broadway's Cherry Lane Theater,  
is a sweet-tempered flowering of first love. Yet the play is not 
overly sentimental. Whenever it threatens to get soggy, Harvey 
supplies a tart one-liner that adds some acidity to the 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	Teen-age Jamie and next-door neighbor Ste are tentative, shy and  
totally confused about their sexuality. Jamie's slutty neighbor, 
Leah, and tart-tongued mother, Sandra, are not much more realistic. 
</P>
<P>
	Leah spends her days listening to old recordings of the Mamas  
and the Papas, particularly idolizing the late, great Mama Cass. 
Sandra, overworked and abandoned by her husband, has an attentive 
younger boyfriend. She, too, has dreams of moving from waitress to 
pub owner. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the main focus of the play is on the two boys. Ste moves in  
with his friend after a row with an abusive father. In the close 
quarters of a cramped apartment, the attraction grows, at first 
terrifying them both. Acceptance of themselves and by others, done 
to the soundtrack of Mama Cass, is a fitting and touching finale. 
</P>
<P>
	Ste is played by the lanky, likable Daniel Eric Gold who has  
gawkiness down to perfection. Matt Stinton's Jamie is a little more 
knowing about his sexuality. After all, he knows that Eleanor 
Parker played Capt. von Trapp's fiancee in the movie version of 
``The Sound of Music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the raunchy Leah, Susan Bennett provides comic relief and  
still manages to prove touchingly insecure. Kirsten Sahs captures 
the sexy toughness of Jamie's mother, anchoring the play in a 
practicality that stands in contrast to the giddy romance happening 
under her nose. Kurt Brocker, as the mother's understanding 
boyfriend, may be stuck with the innocuous nice-guy role, but 
Brocker pulls it off with considerable charm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Beautiful Thing,'' first done on stage in London in 1994, has  
had a backwards history in the United States. It first surfaced 
here in 1996 as a film, directed by Hettie MacDonald. 
</P>
<P>
	This production started last year at the tiny Famous Door  
Theater in Chicago, where it was a big success. Judging from 
theatergoers' responses at a recent performance, that popularity 
should be repeated here.

<HEADLINE> Profanity Found in TV Wrestling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A study has found that a popular cable  
television's wrestling show is packed with obscene gestures, 
crotch-grabbing, satanic rituals -- and a bit of actual wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
	A detailed Indiana University investigation of 50 ``WWF Raw''  
episodes last year on the USA network turned up a staggering amount 
of profane or risque incidents and an average of less than 36 
minutes of wrestling in a two-hour show. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers counted 1,658 instances of a character grabbing or  
pointing to their own crotch -- or roughly eight every 30 minutes, 
not counting the slow-motion instant replays. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could see where an adult would be very concerned with the  
frequency at which these behaviors were aired, particularly at this 
time of day,'' Walter Gantz, professor at Indiana's Department of 
Telecommunications, said Monday 
</P>
<P>
	For the past year, wrestling programs on USA or TNT have  
consistently been among the highest-rated shows each week on basic 
cable. But they're far from the goofy fun of the old days. 
</P>
<P>
	The syndicated news show ``Inside Edition'' commissioned the  
Indiana University study for a two-part report airing this week. 
Reporter Matt Meagher said he became interested in studying 
wrestling when his wife, a middle school teacher, told him about 
her students imitating the behavior seen on the shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers counted 157 instances of wrestlers or audience  
members making an obscene gesture and 434 times when people either 
said a sexually charged slogan or displayed one on a handmade sign. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 128 episodes of simulated sexual activity and 47  
references to satanic activity. One segment featured people 
supposedly draining blood from a ``dead'' wrestler and drinking it, 
Gantz said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were also 609 instances of wrestlers or others being  
struck by objects like garbage cans or nightsticks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somehow they managed not to hurt each other,'' Gantz said.  
``I'm not certain that a 10-year-old realizes that they are skilled 
at doing this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Byrne, senior vice president of marketing for the World  
Wrestling Federation, said they were ``responsible broadcasters.'' 
WWF places a parental warning on ``WWF Raw'' and provides calmer 
programs during hours when children are more likely to watch, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrne said ``WWF Raw'' has plots similar to those aired on the  
NBC drama ``NYPD Blue'' and Fox's prime time soap opera ``Beverly 
Hills 90210.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The fans are tuning in for the story lines and the fact that  
we are somewhat edgy makes it more attractive,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A USA network representative had no immediate comment on the  
study.

<HEADLINE> Pirates Welcome Martin Back For Now </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Pirates were geared up to  
welcome outfielder Bernard Gilkey to their spring training camp in 
Bradenton, Fla., on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cancel that party.  
</P>
<P>
	Welcome back, Al Martin. For now.  
</P>
<P>
	The long-rumored trade sending Martin and second baseman Tony  
Womack to Arizona fell through Tuesday when Gilkey wouldn't rework 
a contract worth $11 million in base salary and deferred payments 
over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The player didn't approve of it and didn't want to make the  
change,'' Pirates general manager Cam Bonifay said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonifay isn't sure how a disappointed Martin will react to  
nearly being traded to Arizona, where the outfielder lives in the 
offseason, only to be yanked back to the team he first asked to 
trade him last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't worry about him being ready to come into camp, no  
sir,'' Bonifay said Tuesday. ``Al Martin has always been ready to 
come into camp and perform and work hard, and I would not expect 
anything different this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin will be given every chance to regain his starting job,  
Bonifay said, even though Brian Giles apparently will replace him 
in left field. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, who woke up Tuesday morning expecting to drive 90 miles  
south to the Diamondbacks' camp in Tucson, Ariz., instead was 
packing for an all-night flight to Florida. Because he won't arrive 
until Wednesday morning, he probably won't work out in Bradenton 
until Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unbelievable,'' Martin said of a trade that seemed nearly  
done first on Sunday and again late Monday night. ``I don't know 
what else of say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the collective bargaining agreement, Martin is not  
required to report to camp until March 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I have an obligation to be there, and I'll be there,''  
Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates first tried to deal Martin last summer, but could  
find no takers for an outfielder with moderate power, below-average 
defensive skills and a contract worth $6 million over the next two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Bonifay will begin anew to trade Martin, but could have  
trouble moving him because of the contract and his .239 average 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the opportunity presents itself, and we felt we could get  
quality players and it was a situation where it might help out, we 
might (make a trade),'' Bonifay said. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Martin is unhappy to still be in Pittsburgh, Womack  
clearly is relieved the deal unraveled. 
</P>
<P>
	Womack, the two-time NL stolen base champion, didn't  
particularly want to changes uniforms or positions; the 
Diamondbacks planned to convert the second baseman into a right 
fielder. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like I said all along, I'm happy to play for the Pittsburgh  
Pirates,'' Womack said after completing a morning workout in 
Bradenton. ``I had no desire to go anywhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unless the Pirates swing a deal before their April 5 opener  
against Montreal, Womack will form a double play combination with 
shortstop Pat Meares, who signed a $1.5 million, one-year contract 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	If the trade had gone through, either veteran utilityman Mike  
Benjamin or rookie Warren Morris would have started at second. 
</P>
<P>
	With Womack still around, the Pirates have an unaccustomed glut  
of middle infielders after struggling last season to settle on a 
starting shortstop. Kevin Polcovich, Lou Collier and Abraham Nunez 
split time there but contributed little offensively or defensively. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, they have new infield starters in Meares and third baseman  
Ed Sprague and reliable backups in Benjamin, a part-time starter at 
second base for Boston last season, and non-roster spring training 
invitee Rafael Bournigal. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonifay said it was better the trade didn't go through if Gilkey  
didn't want to play in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always said that sometimes the best trades are the ones  
that are not made,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants More Kids on Medicaid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the aid of a toll-free hot line,  
President Clinton appealed Tuesday for poor parents to seek 
Medicaid or state health coverage for their children. ``It's up to 
you to find out if your child is eligible,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president kicked off the national Insure Kids Now campaign,  
which seeks to educate families on obtaining coverage under 
Medicaid and the new Children's Health Insurance Program. The goal 
is to enroll the millions of children thought to be eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our message must be: 'What you don't know about your  
children's health insurance options can hurt them,''' Clinton said. 
``But let's be frank -- to reach them all, everyone who can touch 
the life of a child or the child's parents needs to be involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He recited the campaign's toll-free number -- 1-877-KIDS-NOW --  
and had the audience in the East Room repeat it with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not hard to remember, and important not to forget,'' Clinton  
said. ``It's one of the few things I can think of to say that's 
subject to absolutely no controversy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Along with first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, Health and Human  
Services Secretary Donna Shalala and officers from the National 
Governors Association, Clinton unveiled two public service ads that 
would begin airing on television networks Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In one ad, Mrs. Clinton speaks of how parents often want to give  
their children a bicycle or a dog, but the best thing they could 
provide is access to health care. ``Every child should be 
covered,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other, actors S. Epatha Merkerson and Benjamin Bratt,  
stars on the NBC drama ``Law &AMP; Order,'' urge parents to at least 
determine if their children are eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doing the best for your kids means what?'' asks Bratt.  
``Keeping them healthy,'' replies Merkerson. 
</P>
<P>
	There also will be an ad in Spanish on Univision, to target the  
estimated 25 percent of uninsured Hispanic children, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials also planned to run radio ads in 45 states  
over a four-week period, beginning Tuesday in Alabama, California, 
Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, New Jersey, North 
Carolina, Ohio and Utah. The campaign will be followed in the 
spring by an editorial on children's health insurance in USA Today 
and a full-page ad in Time magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said it is ``inconceivable'' that the United States,  
with all its prosperity, has nearly 11 million children who lack 
health insurance. ``They deserve to be as healthy as we feel 
today,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president has stated a goal of enrolling 5 million children  
in Medicaid or the state-based Children's Health Insurance Program, 
or CHIP, within five years. Last year, he directed several federal 
agencies to find better ways to identify eligible children and sign 
them up. 
</P>
<P>
	Shalala compared CHIP to a newly opened restaurant -- ``a few  
customers come in, but we have a lot of empty tables'' -- and said 
the information campaign is necessary to make the program 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
	``CHIP is not a welfare program. It is a serious, substantial  
effort,'' Shalala said. ``We all win when we keep our children 
healthy and make our economy strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said parents often are deterred from seeking health  
benefits in the mistaken belief they are ineligible because they 
work, or because they are frustrated by the application process. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes, the long, complicated forms just seem to be too  
much for a family to take,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's proposed budget for fiscal 2000 includes $1.2 billion  
to assist states in this children's health outreach initiative.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC has decided to air its story on Juanita  
Broaddrick tonight, less than a week after the Arkansas woman's 
claim of a 1978 sexual assault by Bill Clinton hit the newsstands. 
</P>
<P>
	The interview was to be shown on ``Dateline NBC,'' which airs at  
8 p.m. EST. Clinton's lawyers have said the charges are 
``absolutely false.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's Lisa Myers interviewed Broaddrick in January. While the  
network continued to check her allegations, The Wall Street Journal 
editorial page ran a piece Friday based on Broaddrick's charges and 
other media organizations followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC News President Andrew Lack said the network wanted to  
complete its reporting on the story before airing it and wasn't 
angry that others had beaten NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Broaddrick said she first met Clinton in 1978 when he was  
running for governor and she was a campaign worker. A week after 
meeting him, she was in Little Rock, Ark., at a seminar and 
arranged to meet Clinton, then Arkansas' attorney general, for 
coffee at her hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	They went to a hotel room, where Clinton forced her to have sex,  
she claims. ``I was sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton,'' she has 
told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Myers' interview with Broaddrick quickly circulated within the  
media, with some conservative groups charging that NBC sat on the 
interview because it was embarrassing to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone involved in the process knows there's no truth to  
that,'' Lack said Tuesday. He said NBC planned to run the story on 
the first ``Dateline NBC'' available as soon as the reporting was 
complete. NBC finished its reporting Tuesday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The timing of the broadcast had nothing to do with the end of  
Clinton's impeachment trial, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have a story that was 21 years ago, that involves  
lots of information and facts and involves serious charges, you 
need to do a lot of checking,'' he said. ``And that's what we were 
doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lack said he found it ``odd'' that NBC was criticized for taking  
too much time in reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	``You wouldn't have asked that question a few years ago,'' he  
said. ``That is unfortunately some of the fallout of the pace of 
journalism over the past few years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Broaddrick said that she was telling her story to counter  
rumors that she had been bribed and intimidated to stay quiet. She 
complained that NBC had let her ``hang out to dry'' by waiting to 
air the interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Lack said he would not comment on Mrs. Broaddrick's complaints.

<HEADLINE> Uncut Cash Used As Wrapping Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- The green on this wrapping paper is in  
fashion any season of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	It's green, as in greenbacks.  
</P>
<P>
	Maus &AMP; Hoffman, a chain of upscale clothing stores in Florida,  
is offering to wrap presents with uncut sheets of $1 and $2 bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``So many of our customers are older and they have everything,  
and they're so hard to buy for,'' explained Michelle Kielb, who 
works at the store on the ritzy Worth Avenue in Palm Beach. ``It's 
a nice way to get something extra.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maus &AMP; Hoffman, a chain of upscale clothing stores in Florida,  
has been offering to wrap presents with uncut sheets of $1 and $2 
bills for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Naturally, this type of service is not complimentary. In fact,  
depending on the purchase, the wrapping paper may cost more than 
what it's wrapping. 
</P>
<P>
	A sheet of 32 bills -- measuring just large enough to adorn a  
shirt box-- will cost $110 for those who choose the $2 variety. In 
$1 increments, Maus &AMP; Hoffman charges $55. 
</P>
<P>
	The government began selling uncut sheets of bills more than 30  
years ago, mainly to those who wanted to collect or frame it, said 
Claudia Dickens, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Engraving and 
Printing in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency also sells the uncut currency in $5 increments, and  
in sheets of four and 16 bills. The most popular uncut item is the 
set of four $2 bills, according to Dickens. In 1998, the government 
sold $1,395,263 in uncut bills, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	As wrapping paper, sheets of dollar bills might be out of place  
in an average department store. 
</P>
<P>
	But in swanky Palm Beach, where marble watering holes on street  
corners encourage shoppers to ``curb'' their dogs, there's really 
no pretense attached to it, said John Maus, whose family runs six 
stores throughout Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought in the beginning it might be a little ostentatious,  
but I have not had that reaction,'' said Maus, who runs the Palm 
Beach store. ``It's mostly surprise and curiosity. People are 
spending a lot of money to buy something special, and this is just 
a way to top it off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Maus &AMP; Hoffman first began offering the Wrap It In Money  
service more than a decade ago, the people receiving the gifts 
sometimes didn't realize they could slice up their wrapping paper 
and use it at the corner store. 
</P>
<P>
	So Maus &AMP; Hoffman designed a gold seal to put on each wrapped  
package: ``WARNING. Destroying this gift wrap may be hazardous to 
your wealth, as it is an uncut sheet of genuine one dollar bills 
from the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, some still don't get the message.  
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe we got too cute and they miss it because we've heard a  
number of stories -- 'You mean that was real?' You just know it was 
crumpled up and thrown away,'' said Bill Maus, who is John's 
brother.

<HEADLINE> Lakers' Horry Cleared To Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Los Angeles Lakers forward Robert  
Horry, who missed seven games after being diagnosed as having an 
irregular heartbeat, was cleared to play Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The team said medical tests on Horry show that his condition is  
greatly improved to the point where he is not at risk to 
participate in physical activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Lakers spokesman John Black said Horry will be among several  
players including Dennis Rodman who will participate in a limited 
practice Wednesday afternoon at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	Horry, 28, has also been cleared to play in Thursday night's  
game against the Los Angeles Clippers in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors believe the irregular heartbeat was caused by a viral  
infection, but Horry was kept out of games as a precautionary 
measure and to undergo tests.

<HEADLINE> Consumer confidence Rises Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Healthy U.S. economic growth and a strong job  
market bolstered consumer confidence for a fourth-straight month in 
February, and many Americans don't see the good times ending soon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board reported Tuesday that its index of consumer  
confidence rose a stronger-than-expected 3.2 points to 132.1 in 
February from a revised 128.9 in January. The index dropped sharply 
in October and has since been making a steady recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer sentiment is an important economic indicator since  
consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's overall 
economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are upbeat about the current environment and the things  
that influence their everyday lives,'' said Gary Thayer, senior 
economist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ``They have 
jobs and good wages. Interest rates are low and so is 
unemployment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's impeachment trial didn't affect consumers in  
February. Many, instead, enjoyed the benefits of the robust U.S. 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey said it found an all-time low 11.7 percent of  
consumers who reported jobs are hard to get. It also reported more 
Americans said they would buy a car, home or major appliance in the 
next six months. More consumers expect business conditions to get 
better, meaning more jobs and higher paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
	The index that measures feelings about present conditions rose  
5.5 points to 178.4, its highest level ever in the 32 years that 
the survey has been compiled by the private business-financed study 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	The index that measures expectations for the next six months was  
also higher, rising 1.6 points to 101.2. 
</P>
<P>
	The report comes amid strong economic growth in the United  
States, which is surprising to many economists who had expected the 
pace to slow in early 1999 as global financial turmoil threatened 
American prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
	Many worry that if economic growth continues in coming months,  
the Federal Reserve will see a need to raise interest rates. A rate 
hike would preserve the economy's low inflation by slowing consumer 
and business buying demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan signaled in evenhanded congressional  
testimony Tuesday that rates are likely to hold steady for the time 
being. While he said the economy's performance should remain solid 
this year, he cautioned that dangers persist, including the 
possibility of a stock market or the resumption of inflationary 
pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer confidence index, started in 1967, is compiled from  
responses to questions sent to 5,000 households nationwide. The 
survey polls consumers on matters ranging from job prospects to 
buying plans. The index compares results to its base year, 1985, 
when it stood at 100.

<HEADLINE> Schools Sued on Religious Grounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- Three Roman Catholic families are  
suing a school district, claiming fourth-grade vocabulary words 
such as ``ghoul,'' Earth Day celebrations and drug counseling 
violate their religious and privacy rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The families also object to the study of a Hindu god, a field  
trip to a cemetery and a card game with satanic references. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are two standards,'' said James Bendell, the families'  
attorney. ``Any trace of Christianity must be banished, but 
teachers are free to smuggle in Eastern religions and any other 
forms (of belief).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bendell made the remarks during opening statements Monday in the  
federal court trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Satanism, occultism and New Age religions were being fostered,  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The card game ``Magic: The Gathering,'' is worse than  
witchcraft, testified one of the plaintiffs, Mary Ann DiBari. 
</P>
<P>
	Her two granddaughters and four teen-age brothers from another  
family testified how they were offended as Catholics by an assembly 
with a yoga teacher and a visit from a mineralogist who talked 
about crystals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not my religion, and I don't participate in  
deep-breathing exercises,'' said John DiNozzi, 17, referring to the 
yoga session. 
</P>
<P>
	Krystal DiBari, 15, said that when she was in fourth grade, a  
woman leading a field trip to a cemetery asked one of the children 
to lie down on a grave ``to see the size of the people. ... I 
didn't like it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On cross-examination, school district lawyer Warren Richmond got  
some of the children to acknowledge that they had been able to opt 
out of some of the classes and their teachers, while educating them 
about certain cultural beliefs, did not express approval of those 
beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Charles Brieant, who had tried to get school authorities  
to settle the case, repeatedly expressed irritation with the 
lawyers. He sarcastically said, ``That's shocking, isn't it?'' when 
John DiNozzi talked about the presence of senior citizens at Earth 
Day celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
	In his opening, the school district lawyer said the plaintiffs  
had mischaracterized and wildly misrepresented the programs. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the study of Indian and Mexican culture, the celebration  
of Earth Day and the distribution of tiny dolls -- all objected to 
in the lawsuit -- do not amount to the endorsement of religion and 
are standard educational fare replicated throughout the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit stems from the popularity of the card game, which  
divided Bedford in the mid-1990s. Children had been buying the 
cards in packs at candy stores and playing a strategy game, 
sometimes in clubs at school. Some of the cards are lurid 
depictions of demons and one shows a woman about to be sacrificed. 
</P>
<P>
	When some parents objected, the school district put a moratorium  
on the game but it was later rescinded.

<HEADLINE> Wolfpack Set To Leave Coliseum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Deep in their hearts, the North Carolina  
State faithful know it's time to move on. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has suggested trying to save 50-year-old Reynolds  
Coliseum which will play host Wednesday night to its final game. 
The only protests are over the cost of the school's new off-campus 
home, now estimated at $158 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But the closing of Reynolds, built in the days of coach Everett  
Case, won't come without tears and memories of simpler things like 
the $1.50 ticket price when the gym opened in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
	Older fans remember when Case rode on the shoulders of the 1965  
Atlantic Coast Conference title team to cut down the nets a year 
before his death from cancer. There were few dry eyes that day. 
</P>
<P>
	Younger ones recall David Thompson's horrifying fall in the East  
Regional finals in 1974 and subsequent return from the hospital. 
The Wolfpack actually stopped the game and walked off the floor as 
their star emerged, head bandaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Or when Jim Valvano said his goodbye in 1993 just months before  
he, too, would die of cancer. ``That farewell ranks with Lou 
Gehrig's farewell,'' former sports information director Frank 
Weedon said of Valvano's speech to sobbing Wolfpack fans. 
</P>
<P>
	William Neal Reynolds Coliseum, with its bright red seats and  
long, narrow interior, is one of the loudest places in the nation 
to play. Students surround the court, and their rude and crude 
comments are easily within earshot of opposing coaches and players. 
</P>
<P>
	``At N.C. State you've got a guy screaming in my face that my  
wife is ugly, I've got a rotten tie and my shoes stink,'' said 
Virginia coach Pete Gillen. 
</P>
<P>
	In Case's era, 4,000 seats were added to an already framed  
building. That meant more at the ends, resulting in odd viewing 
angles. 
</P>
<P>
	There are six rows of seats on the lower level along the court,  
with an additional 16 in a steep upper deck. In contrast to those 
22 rows, there are 46 in the end zones, where Thompson's retired 
No. 44 jersey hangs along with the a group of banners, including 
two for NCAA titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Former coach Norm Sloan, who played on Case's first team and  
coached the 1974 national champions with Thompson, Tom Burleson and 
Monte Towe, admits to sharing the nostalgia over Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
	``But if you were to talk to coach Case right now, even he would  
say what I'm saying -- that it's time to move on,'' said Sloan, who 
is scheduled to make the last basket at Reynolds, taking a pass 
from Les Robinson, a player, coach and now the athletic director 
for the Wolfpack. 
</P>
<P>
	There are those among the ACC's competitors who will welcome the  
end of Reynolds, where the Wolfpack has a record of 587-176. Some, 
like Maryland coach Gary Williams, thrive on the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a competitor I hope the new arena stays the same as  
Reynolds because this is part of college basketball,'' Williams 
said. ``This place belongs as a big part of college basketball. It 
meant a lot to college basketball in this area of the country to 
have a Reynolds Coliseum back when they did it. It was big time.''

<HEADLINE> Columbia/HCA Loses $42M in Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Columbia/HCA HealthCare continued to lose money  
in the fourth quarter, due partly to declining admissions and costs 
related to a long-running federal fraud investigation, the company 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if expenses related to the probe and other restructuring  
efforts are excluded, the company's profits from continuing 
operations missed Wall Street predictions badly. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the beleaguered hospital chain's stock rose  
slightly Tuesday as investor hopes rose for an end to the 18-month 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia lost $42 million, or 6 cents a share in the quarter,  
well below the loss of $1.2 billion, or $1.92 per share, in the 
fourth quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Profits from continuing operations, which are based on the  
company's regular businesses, were $27 million, or 4 cents per 
share. Analysts had expected profits from operations of 23 cents 
per share, according to survey by the research firm First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia shares rose 37 1/2 cents to $18.75 on the New York Stock  
Exchange. That's still half the price of its 52-week high. 
</P>
<P>
	A big reason investors bought Columbia's stock Tuesday was that  
the company disclosed it had given the U.S. Justice Department a $1 
billion letter of credit. The letter showed the company has access 
to that amount of money in case the government asked for it as part 
of any settlement agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	That disclosure as well as the Justice Department's annoucement  
last month that it was in settlement talks with Columbia have led 
some investors to believe a deal is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	But Columbia said the $1 billion figure was not specifically  
related to how much it may pay as part of the fine-- the figure 
could be higher or lower. And Columbia officials said they could 
not predict when a potential settlement would occur. 
</P>
<P>
	In a move that may delay any settlement, a federal court  
administrative committee on Monday denied a Justice Department 
request to consolidate a number of lawsuits filed against Columbia 
by whistleblowers. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia has also recently completed a $1 billion stock buyback  
and announced plans Tuesday to buy back $1 billion more. The 
buybacks also may have contributed to the stock price gain, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia listed a number of reasons beyond the fraud probe for  
its weak performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them were cuts in federal reimbursements for Medicare  
patients, higher medical costs, particularly for drugs, fewer 
admissions, due in part to the mild flu season and problems 
collecting payments from insurers. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia followed several competitors in reporting  
lower-than-expected earnings, but its results still shocked 
analysts, who expected the company to make more progress on a 
restructuring plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their operations have been eroding in every quarter and we  
don't see any turnaround,'' said Sheryl Skolnick, an analyst with 
BancBoston/Robertson Stephens. ``Hospitals are a volume driven 
business, and if you do not have patients in the beds, this is 
clearly the (profit) margin pressure you would expect to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia's fourth-quarter revenue was up slightly, from $4.37  
billion to $4.42 billion. But admissions to facilities open at 
least one year -- a key measure of the company's vitality -- were off 
1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	For more than 18 months, the federal government and at least 11  
states have been looking into whether Columbia committed fraud by 
overcharging Medicare, Medicaid and other government health 
programs. Four Columbia middle managers were indicted in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	After the investigation began, Columbia cut short an aggressive  
hospital acquisition program and began a major downsizing. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia sold 14 hospitals during the fourth quarter, leaving it  
with 305 hospitals nationwide, down from 336 a year ago. It expects 
to have about 217 hospitals after completing plans to sell or spin 
off hospitals to two separate companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to the investigation, Columbia owned 345 hospitals.  
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Columbia reported a profit of $379 million, or 59  
cents per share, compared with a loss of $305 million or 46 cents 
per share for 1997. Revenue was down slightly, from $18.8 billion 
to $18.7 billion. Part of the earnings boost came from the sale of 
hospitals and other assets.

<HEADLINE> Two Knuckleballers in Marlins' Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Fla. (AP) -- As a sporting goods representative walked  
through the Florida Marlins' clubhouse Tuesday, pitcher Dennis 
Springer waved a glove at him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Got any more of these suckers?'' Springer asked.  
</P>
<P>
	It was a catcher's mitt for fast-pitch softball, bigger but  
lighter than a baseball catcher's glove. Springer has found the 
mitt works best for catching knuckleballs, which means the Marlins 
need to stock up. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-handed Springer and left-hander Kirt Ojala give  
Florida two knuckleball pitchers in camp this spring. They'll 
compete for a job in the starting rotation, and Ojala is also a 
candidate for the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't remember two being on one team,'' manager John Boles  
said. ``Hopefully we've got a catcher who can catch them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a clubhouse filled with hard-throwing young prospects,  
journeymen Springer, 34, and Ojala, 30, provide a contrast because 
of their backgrounds and pitching styles. Each has been with four 
organizations since 1995, and now they hope to land jobs with a 
team rich in knuckleball tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, it was the first pitch in Marlins history. Charlie  
Hough threw a knuckleball for a called strike in Florida's opener 
as an expansion team six years ago. He went on to win that game and 
13 more for the Marlins before retiring in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Springer and Ojala have both discussed the knuckler with Hough,  
who is now a coach for the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year when we went to LA, he came up to me and started  
talking and offering advice,'' Ojala said. ``I was in awe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ojala began relying heavily on a knuckleball just last year.  
</P>
<P>
	``If it's a fraternity, I'm still in the hazing stage,'' he  
joked. 
</P>
<P>
	By the second half of the 1998 season, Ojala was throwing  
knucklers almost half the time. Then a 29-year-old rookie, he 
worked as both a starter and reliever for Florida and went 2-7 with 
a 4.25 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Springer has been relying mostly on the knuckleball since 1988  
but admitted he has yet to perfect the pitch, as his record 
suggests. He went 3-11 last year with a 5.45 ERA for expansion 
Tampa Bay and was briefly demoted to Triple-A. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a humbling sport, and it's a humbling pitch,'' he said.  
``With the knuckleball you have to be perfect. If I throw a bad 
knuckleball to a hitter, he's going to smoke it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's reason for the Marlins to hope for better results from  
Springer this year. He went 9-9 with Anaheim in 1997 and pitched a 
career-high 194 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got a legitimate shot at making this team,'' Boles said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ojala may have a better chance because he is left-handed and  
still improving with the knuckler. He threw it at about 80 mph last 
season and hopes to slow down to 65 mph, which should make the 
pitch flutter more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I peaked later than a lot of people do,'' Ojala said. ``I  
wasn't ready six or seven years ago to be in the big leagues, and I 
can see that now. I take care of myself, and I look at myself as 
being the same as a 22-year-old in this camp. I can pitch another 
10 years the way I feel now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Springer also hopes to pitch into his 40s, but first he must win  
a job this spring. He and Ojala have been assigned adjacent 
lockers, and despite their competition for a paycheck, the 
knuckleballers say they'll gladly share advice. They've played 
catch together the past two days. 
</P>
<P>
	``Watching somebody throw the knuckleball back to you, you might  
figure something out,'' Ojala said. ``I don't know what it would 
be, but I don't think it could hurt -- unless you take it off the 
shin.''

	CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- Bernhard Langer, a two-time Masters  
champion, spent two days at Augusta National before coming to the 
Match Play Championship. He expected to see the changes to four of 
the holes, but saw a lot more than he bargained for. 
</P>
<P>
	Rough.  
</P>
<P>
	At Augusta?  
</P>
<P>
	``It was about this thick,'' Langer said, holding his fingers  
about an inch apart. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether the rough will be there in six weeks remains to be seen.  
Golfweek cited highly placed sources in this week's issue as saying 
tournament officials are debating how high the rough should be and 
how much area it should cover. 
</P>
<P>
	Augusta National officials declined comment.  
</P>
<P>
	If there is rough, its impact would be difficult to measure  
until the second week in April. One source told Golfweek it could 
play almost one stroke tougher, while another said it would only 
give the generous fairways more definition. 
</P>
<P>
	Tournament officials are always tweaking the course that Bobby  
Jones and Alister Mackenzie designed in 1933. Alterations this year 
include an additional 25 yards on the par-5 second hole and the 
par-4 17th, along with pine trees planted down the 15th fairway and 
a rebuilt green on No. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Rough at Augusta would fall in line with those changes in that  
it puts a premium off the tee. On No. 2, for example, long hitters 
like Tiger Woods and David Duval will have to decide whether they 
want to bring the bunker into play. The 15th would penalize any 
drive that strays to the right. 
</P>
<P>
	Augusta officials rarely use the word ``rough,'' instead  
referring to the second cut. Either way, should the ``second cut'' 
be even an inch deep, it would be the most drastic change since 
bentgrass greens were introduced in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SCOUTING REPORT:* Greg Norman obviously doesn't spend as much  
time in Australia as he used to. 
</P>
<P>
	While scouting some of the early action in the Match Play  
Championship, Norman said some players might be in for a tougher 
match than people realize -- like Mark O'Meara against Michael 
Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got international players who are very, very good  
players, who very few people know about,'' Norman said. ``Michael 
Bradley is as good as any young player out of Australia than I have 
ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One problem. Bradley, who will defend his title at Doral next  
week, is from Florida. Norman apparently confused him with Bradley 
Hughes, who is not in the field this week. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ZINGER AND THE BIG CAT:* Should Paul Azinger get in touch with  
Atlanta Braves first baseman Andres Galarraga, he can offer a 
little insight on lymphoma. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's bone related, it's very treatable,'' Azinger said.  
``But that doesn't make the treatment easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga, diagnosed last week with lymphoma, has a tumor lodged  
on a bone at the base of his spinal column. He will be treated with 
five months of chemotherapy and one month of radiation, and doctors 
are optimistic of a full recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Azinger was diagnosed with lymphoma in his left shoulder in  
1994, just four months after he won the 1993 PGA Championship. 
Azinger returned to the PGA Tour a year later, although he hasn't 
won since. 
</P>
<P>
	``You immediately think you're going to die, but when the doctor  
says it's a 90 percent recovery, it frees you up a little bit,'' 
Azinger said. ``It helps to hear people say, `Guess what?' I got 
thousands of letters from people who had been cured.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SOLHEIM SWITCH:* Next year's Solheim Cup is moving.  
</P>
<P>
	Tim Howland of the European Ladies' PGA cited ``commercial  
realities'' for moving the matches from Sunningdale in England to 
Loch Lomond in Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
	The matches, scheduled for Oct. 6-8, 2000, will be played in  
Scotland for the second time since they started in 1990. Europe 
trails 4-1, its only victory coming at Dalmahoy in Scotland in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FIRST TEE:* The world's best golfers aren't the only ones  
profiting from the Match Play Championship. Some future golfers 
will benefit as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament will raise $500,000 to help children learn golf  
through the First Tee program. 
</P>
<P>
	The First Tee golf initiative, created to provide affordable and  
accessible playing opportunities for beginning golfers, is the 
primary charity for the tournament. First Tee will also get 
contributions from the other two World Golf Championship events 
scheduled later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	First Tee, which was unveiled in November 1997 with former  
President Bush as honorary chairman, focuses on giving children who 
would otherwise be unable to afford it an opportunity to learn and 
play golf. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SPIRITED EFFORT:* The USGA has teamed with former President  
Bush, athletes and celebrities to create a new educational 
initiative called ``The Spirit of the Game,'' aimed at teaching new 
golfers about traditions and proper etiquette. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnold Palmer, national chairman of the USGA Members Program,  
came up with the idea two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Arnold was especially concerned about new players and their  
need to know why golf is such a special game,'' USGA president Buzz 
Taylor said. ``We hope all players will embrace this program, learn 
from it and put its lesson into practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The program features a seven-segment videotape, which lasts  
almost an hour. The tape covers the tee box, pace of play, course 
condition, honesty and integrity, greens, walking and riding, and 
manners and behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those taking part in the segments are Jack Nicklaus and  
Nancy Lopez, Hall of Famers Mike Schmidt and Johnny Bench, John 
Elway and Jim Brown, Ivan Lendl, Mario Lemieux and actor John 
O'Hurley. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Spirit of the Game'' also includes a brochure, which will  
be distributed to golf courses and associations throughout the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DIVOTS:* Every field on the West Coast swing had at least a  
stronger field than the previous year. ... One sign the Match Play 
Championship is truly a world event: signs on every hole are marked 
in yards and meters. ... Sara Lee Corp. has decided to drop 
sponsorship of the LPGA's Sara Lee Classic, which has been played 
at the Hermitage Golf Course in Nashville, Tenn., the past 11 
years. Hermitage officials are trying to get a new sponsor for the 
54-hole event with a $750,000 purse. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STAT OF THE WEEK:* Ernie Els is the first player since Jack  
Nicklaus to win at least once in his first six years as a PGA Tour 
member. Nicklaus went 17 years before his first winless season on 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

is crap.'' -- Nick Faldo.

<HEADLINE> Palmer, Vikings Sign Four-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Minnesota Vikings kick returner and  
third-down specialist David Palmer has agreed to terms on a 
four-year contract worth $7.35 million, including a $1.6 million 
signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement averages $1.83 million a season and led the  
fifth-year player who is a free agent to cancel visits to Miami 
today and Baltimore on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, a second-round draft pick in 1994, will likely wait  
until March 1 to sign the deal, when he's in the Twin Cities, said 
his agent, Russ Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer is in Birmingham, Ala., recuperating from offseason  
arthroscopic shoulder surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Palmer became the first Viking since Herschel  
Walker in 1989 to return a kickoff for a touchdown, and he broke 
Eddie Payton's 1980 team record for combined kick and punt return 
yardage, with 1,435 yards. On offense, he caught 18 passes for 185 
yards and rushed 10 times for 52 yards.

<HEADLINE> Prosecution Rests Marine Jet Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A backseat crewman aboard the Marine  
jet that cut an Italian ski gondola cable, killing 20 people, 
testified Tuesday that he didn't think the pilot was 
``flat-hatting,'' or flying recklessly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't have any reason to believe we were flying below'' the  
minimum altitude, said Capt. William Raney, 27. ``If at any time I 
thought we were going out to flat-hat, I would have stopped the 
flight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raney's testimony came as prosecutors wrapped up their case in  
the court-martial of Capt. Richard Ashby, 31, who is charged with 
involuntary manslaughter and other counts and could get 200 years 
in prison. Prosecutors say Ashby was flying too low and too fast 
and executed a dangerous 360-degree roll before hitting the cable 
last February. 
</P>
<P>
	Raney sat in one of the EA-6B Prowler's back seats, where the  
jet's radar detection and jamming equipment is located. Just before 
the plane hit the cable, Raney told an eight-man military jury, the 
pilot sharply banked the jet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was obvious he was trying to miss something,'' Raney said.  
``It was very jerky, very abrupt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On cross-examination, Raney said he was not concerned about his  
safety until the impact and he praised Ashby as a safe, 
professional pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	Raney was called as a government witness under a grant of  
immunity. Last week, the jury heard from Capt. Chandler Seagraves, 
29, another backseat crewman. The navigator, Capt. Joseph 
Schweitzer, 31, still faces trial. 
</P>
<P>
	All four Marines were stationed on duty for Bosnia at the NATO  
base in Aviano, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Seagraves, Raney said he never heard the jet's radar  
altimeter alarm during the last leg of the flight, but did hear it 
earlier as the jet crossed ridges. The ski lift was severed between 
360 and 370 feet, and the altimeter had been set to sound an alarm 
at 800 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Col. James Brubaker, a navigation expert, testified the crew  
was not qualified to fly a low-level flight at such high speeds 
because it had been seven months since Ashby's last low-level 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
	``My opinion is that the route was flown exceedingly fast and it  
was flown at an altitude lower than they planned to fly it,'' 
Brubaker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers contend that Ashby's radar altimeter  
malfunctioned and that he was misled by a map that didn't show the 
cable system. They also argue that an optical illusion may have 
made Ashby think he was flying higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense witnesses are expected to begin testifying Wednesday,  
and closing arguments are expected during the middle of next week.

<HEADLINE> White House Mulls Next Kosovo Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The three-week pause in troubled Kosovo peace  
talks gives administration officials more time to build their case 
for why U.S. troops may be sent there. Congress isn't making it 
particularly easy for them. 
</P>
<P>
	The failure of Serbs and ethnic Albanians to reach an agreement  
to end their yearlong conflict in the southern Serbian province 
only has increased skepticism on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who intervened in the  
talks in Rambouillet, France, ``has done the best she could, but 
she had a very weak hand to play,'' said Sen. Dick Lugar, R-Ind., 
who is influential on foreign policy matters. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though both sides made some concessions in the 17 days of  
talks, and another session in France is planned for March 15, the 
remaining differences are pretty much what they were before the 
talks began, Lugar suggested: ``The Serbians do not want NATO in 
Kosovo. And the Kosavars want at least a formula for how they get 
to independence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional leaders had hoped to move a ``sense of Congress''  
resolution to weigh in and show support for U.S. troops, if 
necessary. But, with the negotiating pause -- and NATO airstrikes on 
hold -- the leaders aren't quite sure what it should say. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans want to require President Clinton to get  
congressional approval before sending troops to Kosovo as part of 
any NATO peacekeeping force. Others want to express concern about 
the impact of yet another overseas deployment on overall military 
morale and readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has proposed contributing 4,000 U.S. troops to a  
28,000-strong NATO force -- if there is a peace agreement to 
enforce. So far, there's not. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has justified the deployments on the ground that ethnic  
conflict in Kosovo threatens ``Europe's stability and future.'' He 
has said the violence could spread to Macedonia, Greece and Turkey 
if left unchecked. 
</P>
<P>
	But there have been skeptics.  
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman of the House  
International Relations Committee, doubts that any plan, even if 
backed by NATO troops, will succeed so long as Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic remains in power in Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	``This cannot be a very satisfactory outcome for the Congress or  
for most of the American people or for the administration, who will 
sooner or later be asking why we are investing our treasure and 
perhaps our blood in a part of the world that is remote indeed from 
our ordinary interests,'' Gilman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo is part of Serbia, the dominant republic of what's left  
of Yugoslavia. Kosovo, where ethnic-Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-1, 
had self-rule powers until Milosevic revoked them in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration contends that, without foreign soldiers to  
oversee the drawdown of Serbian police and Army forces from Kosovo, 
a peace settlement would never stick. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, citing his  
experiences with Vietnam, contends that sending troops to Kosovo 
could create another quagmire for the United States. ``Kosovo is no 
more a threat to America than Haiti was to Europe -- and we never 
asked for NATO support there,'' Kissinger wrote in an op-ed essay 
in The Washington Post earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't agree with that, and the Clinton administration  
doesn't agree with that either,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon 
said Tuesday. ``This would be a NATO force that would go in. The 
United States is the leading member of NATO, and we would play an 
appropriate role in the force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then Bacon uttered the dreaded ``B'' word: ``It should be very  
clear that the U.S. participation would be much smaller than it is 
in Bosnia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American troops were sent to Bosnia, a former Yugoslav republic  
itself, in late 1995 as part of a NATO peacekeeping force. Clinton 
initially assured Congress the mission would end within a year, but 
it is continuing today with no certain end in sight. There are 
still about 6,700 U.S. troops in Bosnia, down from a peak of more 
than 22,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., cautioned that U.S.  
forces ``could become involved in yet another costly, open-ended 
and ill-defined peacekeeping mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And even some key Democrats have expressed concern.  
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we are wearing out our troops,'' Rep. Ike Skelton of  
Missouri, the senior Democrat on the House Armed Services 
Committee, wrote to Defense Secretary William Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we indeed deploy forces to Kosovo, let me urge you in the  
strongest terms possible to eliminate or reduce our commitments 
elsewhere -- in the Sinai, in Macedonia, in Haiti, in Bosnia.''

<HEADLINE> Baseball to Umps: Call High Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball's plan to raise the strike zone has  
raised the ire of umpires, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Friday, a memo was sent to all 30 major league teams,  
telling them the official definition of the strike zone ``will be 
more strictly enforced'' by umpires this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The note came from Sandy Alderson, the new executive director of  
baseball operations and part of the restructured commissioner's 
office under Bud Selig. 
</P>
<P>
	The move appears designed to get umpires to call higher strikes.  
In recent years, umpires rarely called any pitch above the belt a 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
	But umpires union head Richie Phillips said his people were left  
out of the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Neither the umpires or the umpires association were consulted  
on this issue,'' Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see how anyone could say we're going to more strictly  
enforce a rule,'' he said. ``The umpires enforce all of the rules. 
That's been their job for more than 100 years. It is deplorable for 
the commissioner's office to indicate that the umpires have not 
strictly enforced all of the rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a rarity, the players association backed owners, for the most  
part. 
</P>
<P>
	``There never has been a good reason for why players should have  
to adjust to 32 different strike zones, so some effort to make the 
strike zone more uniform is to be welcomed,'' said Gene Orza, the 
No. 2 official of the players union. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the other hand, asking the umpires to undertake right away  
a wholesale change in the way they do their business could upset 
the tempo of the game. What's required here is the right mix of 
determination and patience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The existence of the memo, which was sent to teams Friday, was  
first reported Monday by the Los Angeles Times, and a copy of the 
memo was obtained by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is to inform you that, at the direction of commissioner  
Selig, and after consultation with the league presidents, the 
`strike zone' as defined in the official playing rules will be more 
strictly enforced in 1999 by umpires in both leagues,'' Alderson 
wrote to teams. 
</P>
<P>
	In the memo, which was sent to all managers and general  
managers, Alderson said that while the top of the strike zone is 
difficult to define, ``the upper limit of the strike zone will 
extend two inches above the top of the uniform pants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Criticism of differing strike zones escalated during the 1997 NL  
playoffs when a wide strike zone by Eric Gregg led to a 
15-strikeout game by Florida's Livan Hernandez against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	AL umpires were criticized for several blown calls during last  
year's playoffs, one of the reasons Selig is trying to shift 
responsibility over umpires away from the leagues to Alderson. 
</P>
<P>
	``The strike zone is the strike zone,'' Phillips said. ``Is  
there a different strike zone in the American League and National 
League? Definitely not. Some of them may see it different, but the 
strike zone is the strike zone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The umpires' labor agreement expires after this season, and a  
confrontation between owners and umpires is expected. Umpires have 
been demanding more backing since 1996, when Roberto Alomar, then 
of the Baltimore Orioles, spit at umpire John Hirschbeck and was 
suspended for only five games. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, umpires have demanded owners and players agree to a  
``code of conduct.'' While there were several meetings two years 
ago, agreement on a code has still proved elusive. 
</P>
<P>
	Alderson's memo may heighten tensions between the sides.  
</P>
<P>
	``But I'm not surprised by what goes on in the baseball offices  
at Park Avenue,'' Phillips said.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Fall on Greenspan Remarks / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury prices tumbled Tuesday after Federal  
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan suggested that higher interest 
rates could be on the way if the economy doesn't slow down. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 1 1/8 point,  
or $11.25 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction, rose to 5.43 percent from 5.35 percent late 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In his biannual report to Congress, Greenspan said the U.S.  
economy remains ``surprisingly robust'' and should continue growing 
this year, although at a slower pace. He also hinted the Fed might 
raise interest rates to ease demand and contain inflationary 
pressures if the economy does not show signs of slowing. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher interest rates would hurt bond prices by making the  
yields on bonds already in circulation less attractive. Rising 
inflation would make fixed-income investments less appealing as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were off between 3/16 point and 5/32 point, and intermediate 
maturities were off 7/16 point to to 11/16 point, reported Bridge

<HEADLINE> Owners Catch No Arbitration Breaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- While baseball owners won nine of the 11  
hearings, players were still the big winners in salary arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	The 62 players in arbitration this year averaged a record 169  
percent salary increase, topped by a record 1,517 percent raise for 
Texas pitcher Rick Helling, according to a study by The Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Helling, who went 20-7 and tied for the AL lead in wins, went  
from a $216,500 salary last year to an average of $3.5 million with 
a $10.5 million, three-year contract with the Rangers. That topped 
the 1,511 percent raise Milwaukee outfielder Jeromy Burnitz got 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston closer Billy Wagner got the second-highest percentage  
raise this year, increasing 1,126 percent from $280,000 to 
$3,433,333 with a $10.3 million, three-year deal with the Astros. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall increase was up from a 150 percent average last year  
and broke the previous record of 154 percent, set in 1997. Salaries 
for those who filed rose from an average of $781,780 to an average 
of $2,099,790, breaking the previous record of $2,091,187, set in 
1994 before a 7 1/2-month strike. 
</P>
<P>
	While owners won most of the hearings, they lost their two  
biggest cases, losing to a pair of New York Yankees stars: 
shortstop Derek Jeter and closer Mariano Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
	While owners have a 236-181 advantage in cases since arbitration  
began in 1974, they hate the process and repeatedly attempt to 
negotiate it out of existence because it forces small- and 
middle-market teams to match the salaries paid to young players by 
large-market rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Players with three to six years of major league service are  
eligible for arbitration, along with about a dozen players with two 
to three years in the majors. After six seasons, a player becomes 
eligible for free agency. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a new effort this year by management's labor lawyers  
to push for better settlements by teams, and it paid off. Of the 19 
players who avoided hearings by agreeing to one-year contracts, 12 
settled below the midpoint, seven settled at the midpoint and none 
settled above. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, there were eight settlements above the midpoint  
last year, seven at the midpoint and 22 below. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners also pushed for earlier settlements, with 24 of the 62  
players agreeing before the exchange of numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	But players were extremely aggressive in asking for large  
increases, which caused the record raises. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-four players -- nearly three of four filing -- doubled their  
salaries, down from 49 last year, and 26 tripled, down from 29. But 
17 got fivefold raises, an increase of two, and 11 got sixfold 
raises, also an increase of two. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay left-hander Terrell Wade, on the disabled list for  
most of last season, got the smallest raise, a 12 percent increase 
from $222,500 to $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven players agreed to multiyear contracts, down from 19 last  
year and 14 in 1997.

<HEADLINE> D.C. To Make Pitch for Baseball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two years after luring professional hockey and  
basketball from the suburbs, officials in Washington, D.C. said 
Tuesday they would make a major pitch for professional baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baseball will be an economic home run for the district,'' said  
Mayor Anthony Williams, as he pledged the support of local 
officials to return major league baseball to the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said visions of a modern stadium within view of  
national landmarks such as the Washington Monument and the U.S. 
Capitol should be alluring for fans and teams alike. About 25 
million people visit Washington each year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure many of them would love to see their home team play  
while they were here,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	The district hasn't had baseball since the Washington Senators  
left after the 1971 season and became the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington officials hope a National League team will relocate,  
but William Collins is trying to lure one to the suburbs of 
Northern Virginia. Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos is 
expected to attempt to block any move, claiming it infringes on his 
team's territory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Montreal Expos, the most likely team to move, have asked  
that a March 6 deadline to find new ownership and have stadium 
plans in place be pushed back by a few months.

<HEADLINE> Internet Auctions Blamed for Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J (AP) -- Consumer complaints of online fraud jumped  
sixfold last year, with Internet auctions prompting two out of 
every three complaints, a consumer group reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of consumers complaining that they were defrauded  
online went from 1,280 in 1997 to 7,752 last year, according to 
Internet Fraud Watch, an online fraud reporting system created by 
the National Consumers League. 
</P>
<P>
	As officials in New Jersey, California and New York try to cope  
with a brand of fraud that defies boundaries, the Federal Trade 
Commission said it is launching a 24-hour Internet fraud-detecting 
group next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``More people are online, and more people are getting scammed,''  
Susan Grant, director of Internet Fraud Watch, told New Jersey 
Attorney General Peter Verniero and a state panel at a hearing 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 10 complaints by callers to Internet Fraud Watch are, in  
order of frequency: auctions, general merchandise sales, computer 
equipment and software, Internet services, work-at-home offers, 
business opportunities, marketing schemes, credit card offers, 
advance fee loans and employment offers. 
</P>
<P>
	William Porter, a La Platta, Md., scientist, said he gave up  
trying to get his money back after he paid a California-based 
seller $615 for a computer that never arrived following an online 
sale hosted by eBay, the largest Internet auction service. He still 
bids online to add to his collection of vintage GI Joe action 
figures, but now he'll rarely risk more than $100. 
</P>
<P>
	``The payoff is you're getting things at substantially reduced  
prices or things that you can't get anywhere else,'' Porter said. 
``But you've got to use common sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York City's Department of Consumer Affairs said last month  
it is looking into whether some online auction sellers are offering 
bogus baseball paraphernalia, and a Ventura County, Calif., 
district attorney has prosecuted auction house Alto for failing to 
file a $20,000 bond with the state for holding auctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Grifters have followed the surge that has brought 79 million  
Americans to the Internet, regulators say. Market researcher 
Jupiter Communications estimates that the number of Internet 
auction customers will jump sixfold from 1.2 million to 6.5 million 
by 2000, when they will spend about $7.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission is increasing its surveillance of  
Internet fraud, but the agency says such crimes are not yet among 
its top complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	Eileen Harrington of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection  
said the agency plans to set up a special unit next month to 
monitor the Internet 24 hours a day to look out for scam artists. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency held a meeting in August to inform online auction  
houses they needed to take extra measures to protect consumers, she 
said. Some, including eBay, did add security measures and penalties 
for bogus bidders and sellers who don't deliver what they promise. 
</P>
<P>
	``Out of roughly every million transactions we receive  
notification of incidents of fraud of about 27 to 30,'' eBay chief 
executive Meg Whitman said in an interview last month. ``There are 
a small number of incidents, but we are working hard to make sure 
that no one has a bad experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Consumer League notes that many consumers take  
their complaints directly to Internet Fraud Watch or federal 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC last week tracked down a group of three people sharing a  
house in Malibu, Calif., who allegedly were charging customers 
without their knowledge for nonexistent Internet services totaling 
$45 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people had never heard of this company, and many of them  
didn't even have computers,'' Ms. Harrington said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC has pursued at least 57 cases of alleged Internet Fraud,  
but only one has involved an online auction. In that case, Craig 
Lee Hare of Lake Worth, Fla., was sentenced to six months of home 
detention for selling computers he failed to deliver. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer advocates say people who buy on the Internet should use  
either a credit card or buy through an escrow service, a third 
party that will hold payment of the check until the consumer is 
satisfied for a fee of 3 to 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``If somebody sends a check or a money order off-line to  
somebody they don't know, they're asking for trouble,'' Ms. 
Harrington said at the hearing Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Volkswagen Profits Rise in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WOLFSBURG, Germany (AP) -- Volkswagen's profits rose 65 percent  
last year, but the German automaker warned that it may not be able 
to improve on those results in 1999 because of difficult global 
economic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Volkswagen reported Tuesday that it earned 2.24 billion German  
marks ($1.26 billion) last year, up from 1.36 billion marks in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales jumped 18 percent to 134 billion marks ($75.4 billion)  
from 113.2 billion marks. 
</P>
<P>
	But the company said in a statement that it would likely post  
weaker results this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``A further improvement in group net profit in 1999 will be  
difficult to achieve given the crises in the global automobile 
markets,'' Volkswagen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were released after the close of stock market  
trading in Frankfurt, where Volkswagen shares rose 6 percent 
earlier as the market rallied. 
</P>
<P>
	Volkswagen said it would provide more details about its earnings  
figures in a news conference scheduled for March 25.

<HEADLINE> Viacom Boosting Internet Presence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Viacom Inc. is hoping the same people who made  
MTV and Nickelodeon two of cable's most-watched networks will do 
the same for the company's Internet business. 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom is expanding the Web sites for those popular cable  
channels into broader online ``communities'' for music fans and 
kids, following rival media giants who are putting greater emphasis 
on doing business in cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the plan, Viacom announced Tuesday it will create a  
new division to run its online businesses and may eventually spin 
it off into a separate company, hoping to cash in on the Internet's 
growing popularity among consumers and investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The company believes the success of Nickelodeon, MTV and sister  
network VH1 on television will draw a wealth of advertisers to the 
sites and lure consumers into online sales of CDs, concert tickets 
and toys. 
</P>
<P>
	``We start with a big leg up. We start with the most powerful  
brands in the industry,'' said Sumner Redstone, Viacom's chairman 
and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom would not say how much it is spending overall to expand  
its online business, but said it will pour $250 million over the 
next five years into promoting the sites on the cable networks. 
Viacom has already used similar cross-promotion strategies to 
create successful movies and books from the TV shows ``Star Trek'' 
and ``Rugrats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom is trying to keep up with rivals such as Walt Disney Co.,  
Time Warner Inc. and News Corp. in racing to upgrade its online 
holdings and seek ways to turn a profit in cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
	``Viacom is a little bit late to the game, but there's certainly  
time to create a decent franchise,'' said Barry Hyman, an analyst 
at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, MTV and Nickelodeon already have two of the most  
popular Web sites, according to Internet research firm Media 
Metrix. MTV.com had 1.6 million individual visitors last month, 
with Nick.com at 1.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom's vast holdings include Paramount Pictures, the  
Blockbuster video chain, the UPN network and the Showtime and 
Comedy Central cable networks. It sold most of the Simon &AMP; Schuster 
publishing house last year but retained its consumer book 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The first result of the company's new Internet approach will be  
a music site to launch in June that will link to MTV.com and 
VH1.com but offer a much more extensive music library, including 
jazz, classical and country. 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom announced Tuesday that it acquired online radio  
broadcaster Imagine Radio for an undisclosed amount, which will 
allow Viacom's new music site to offer 100 channels of Internet 
radio. Visitors will be able to punch in their favorite artists and 
genres to create customized online broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
	The site also will feature videos, links to sites of record  
labels and artists, and areas for buying CDs or concert tickets. It 
does not yet have a name but is code-named ``The Buggles Project,'' 
a reference to the band whose ``Video Killed the Radio Star'' video 
launched MTV in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom is also expanding its Nick.com site to offer a broader  
array of kid-oriented features from Nickelodeon and other 
providers, and adding services such as e-mail and online chats. 
</P>
<P>
	The new version of Nickelodeon's site will debut in September  
and will employ two recent Viacom acquisitions: Red Rocket, an 
online educational toy retailer, and Nvolve Inc., a Web site 
developer. 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom's new Internet division will report to Tom Freston,  
chairman and chief executive of MTV Networks, who said negotiations 
are under way with many companies to provide content for both new 
sites.

<HEADLINE> Economy Affects Social Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Improving the economy -- by paying off the  
national debt or cutting taxes, for example -- would be one of the 
best ways to help ensure the nation can afford promised Social 
Security benefits, congressional budget analysts said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The size of Social Security's trust fund, on the other hand, is  
irrelevant, say the nonpartisan researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the Social Security trust fund, we have debt, not assets,''  
said Dan L. Crippen, director of the Congressional Budget Office. 
``It's the size of the economy that ultimately determines the 
ability of the nation to support a growing elderly population.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crippen gave lawmakers at hearings in both the House and Senate  
the CBO's preliminary analysis of the Social Security rescue plan 
President Clinton proposed in his State of the Union speech last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans in Congress have criticized the plan, but have not  
yet come up with a unified counterproposal. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici,  
R-N.M., said he will introduce legislation requiring that most of 
the federal budget surpluses expected in coming years go toward 
paying off the national debt, unless lawmakers agree to use them to 
help along reforms that would control Social Security's costs in 
the future. To spend the money on anything else would require 
agreement by more than a majority of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Domenici said his approach would leave money for the broad tax  
cuts Republicans want, which is precluded by Clinton's plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's gone to great lengths to see that there are no tax cuts  
available to the American people for quite some time. I don't think 
we need to do that,'' Domenici said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's plan would use about two-thirds of federal budget  
surpluses expected over the next 15 years to pay down the 
government's debts to private investors who hold Treasury bonds, 
which many economists believe would help the economy grow. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, the president would put IOUs in Social Security's trust  
fund based on the expectation that more money would flow from a 
bigger economy and could be used to pay off those IOUs. 
</P>
<P>
	CBO analysts agreed with Republican critics who say that  
wouldn't set aside cold, hard cash to pay retirement benefits in 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a transfer (of money). It's a creation of new debt  
and I think it's confusing,'' said Barry B. Anderson, CBO's deputy 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	But strategies like Clinton's that try to improve the economy  
could make it easier to pay retirement benefits promised in the 
future, the CBO analysts said, and lawmakers should be considering 
such possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``There may be governmental programs or tax reductions that  
increase economic growth more than debt reduction,'' Crippen said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, lawmakers could look for ways to control  
Social Security's costs -- such as raising the retirement age or 
making stock market investments that could bring a greater return 
for the program's money -- the CBO analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Social Security Commissioner Kenneth S. Apfel said Clinton is  
willing to discuss such options. The president wants to ``achieve 
bipartisan action on the hard choices that must still be made,'' 
Apfel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders on Tuesday also signaled willingness to work  
with Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where there are flaws in the White House proposal, let's fix  
them. Where there are good ideas, let's seize them,'' said House 
Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Pending the introduction of their own plan, Archer said House  
Republicans will push for a floor vote later this week on a 
nonbinding resolution asking lawmakers to commit to shoring up 
Social Security without raising taxes.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants More Kids on Medicaid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the aid of a toll-free hot line,  
President Clinton appealed Tuesday for poor parents to seek 
Medicaid or state health coverage for their children. ``It's up to 
you to find out if your child is eligible,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president kicked off the national Insure Kids Now campaign,  
which seeks to educate families on obtaining coverage under 
Medicaid and the new Children's Health Insurance Program. The goal 
is to enroll the millions of children thought to be eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our message must be: 'What you don't know about your  
children's health insurance options can hurt them,''' Clinton said. 
``But let's be frank -- to reach them all, everyone who can touch 
the life of a child or the child's parents needs to be involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He recited the campaign's toll-free number -- 1-877-KIDS-NOW --  
and had the audience in the East Room repeat it with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not hard to remember, and important not to forget,'' Clinton  
said. ``It's one of the few things I can think of to say that's 
subject to absolutely no controversy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Along with first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, Health and Human  
Services Secretary Donna Shalala and officers from the National 
Governors Association, Clinton unveiled two public service ads that 
would begin airing on television networks Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In one ad, Mrs. Clinton speaks of how parents often want to give  
their children a bicycle or a dog, but the best thing they could 
provide is access to health care. ``Every child should be 
covered,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other, actors S. Epatha Merkerson and Benjamin Bratt,  
stars on the NBC drama ``Law &AMP; Order,'' urge parents to at least 
determine if their children are eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doing the best for your kids means what?'' asks Bratt.  
``Keeping them healthy,'' replies Merkerson. 
</P>
<P>
	There also will be an ad in Spanish on Univision, to target the  
estimated 25 percent of uninsured Hispanic children, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials also planned to run radio ads in 45 states  
over a four-week period, beginning Tuesday in Alabama, California, 
Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, New Jersey, North 
Carolina, Ohio and Utah. The campaign will be followed in the 
spring by an editorial on children's health insurance in USA Today 
and a full-page ad in Time magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said it is ``inconceivable'' that the United States,  
with all its prosperity, has nearly 11 million children who lack 
health insurance. ``They deserve to be as healthy as we feel 
today,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president has stated a goal of enrolling 5 million children  
in Medicaid or the state-based Children's Health Insurance Program, 
or CHIP, within five years. Last year, he directed several federal 
agencies to find better ways to identify eligible children and sign 
them up. 
</P>
<P>
	Shalala compared CHIP to a newly opened restaurant -- ``a few  
customers come in, but we have a lot of empty tables'' -- and said 
the information campaign is necessary to make the program 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
	``CHIP is not a welfare program. It is a serious, substantial  
effort,'' Shalala said. ``We all win when we keep our children 
healthy and make our economy strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said parents often are deterred from seeking health  
benefits in the mistaken belief they are ineligible because they 
work, or because they are frustrated by the application process. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes, the long, complicated forms just seem to be too  
much for a family to take,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's proposed budget for fiscal 2000 includes $1.2 billion  
to assist states in this children's health outreach initiative.
