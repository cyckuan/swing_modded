<HEADLINE> Ullrich Keeps Tour of Spain Lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AVILA, Spain (AP) -- Frank Vandenbroucke of Belgium won the 19th  
stage of the Tour of Spain cycling race Friday, and German Jan 
Ullrich kept his overall lead with two days left. 
</P>
<P>
	Ullrich ended the leg as he began it, with a 31-second lead over  
his nearest rival Igor Gonzalez Galdeano of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	Vandenbroucke covered Friday's 114-miles from El Escorial to  
Avila in west-central Spain in 4 hours, 54 minutes and 18 seconds. 
The group of cyclists that included Ullrich and Gonzalez Galdeano 
were 20 seconds back. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spaniard said catching Ullrich would require the German to  
make an uncharacteristic mistake in Saturday's sage -- a 2.8-mile 
time-trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Ullrich slips up, we will try to take advantage, but it  
isn't going to be easy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The race ends Sunday in Madrid.

<HEADLINE> London Shares Close Lower / British Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The London Stock Exchange blue chip index fell  
Friday, but NatWest shares soared on an unsolicited takeover bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed down  
32.1 points, or 0.5 percent, at 5,937.6. 
</P>
<P>
	Provisional volume came to 1.3 billion shares, compared with 1.2  
billion on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Reuters Group PLC shares, which dropped 15 percent on Thursday,  
fell an additional 3 percent Friday. The media and financial 
information company's stock faded following a briefing for analysts 
Wednesday that raised questions about the performance of its 
Instinet electronic stock-trading unit. 
</P>
<P>
	NatWest Bank shares soared 29 percent after Bank of Scotland  
made an unsolicited $34.3 billion bid for its rival, which is more 
than three times its size. Analysts said they expected additional 
bids for NatWest. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of Scotland shares rose 6.2 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	The bid shook up the rest of the banking sector, as investors  
eyed other potential marriages with the view that one merger would 
push others to the altar in order to stay competitive.

<HEADLINE> Duncan To Promote Virgin Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) -- NBA Finals MVP Tim  
Duncan of the San Antonio Spurs signed a contract Friday to promote 
his native U.S. Virgin Islands in exchange for tax breaks on his 
planned business enterprises there. 
</P>
<P>
	``Welcome home,'' Gov. Charles Turnbull said at a small ceremony  
on Duncan's native island of St. Croix, attended by Duncan's 
father, sister and about 100 others. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan will participate in three official advertisements a year  
for 15 years to promote the U.S. Caribbean territory as a tourist 
destination. The tax breaks he will receive will apply to Duncan's 
T.D. Enterprises Inc., from which he plans to set up businesses 
such as sports bars and promotional merchandising outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	The local legislature must still approve the contract, which is  
to go into effect Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal, Duncan reestablished his residency in the  
U.S. Virgin Islands and will pay income tax from his multimillion 
dollar NBA salary and other sources to the island government, which 
has been seeking new revenues to chip away at its more than $1 
billion in debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not often that you see a situation where both parties  
come up with a good deal,'' Duncan told Radio WRRA after the 
ceremony. ``We're still in the process of looking at a bunch of 
(business ideas). There's not a rush to do anything now -- the thing 
will be on its way soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 15-year tax breaks cover corporate income taxes, gross  
receipt, Customs and excise taxes. T.D. Enterprises' real property 
taxes will be waived for one executive headquarters, two 
promotional merchandising outlets and two sports bars. 
</P>
<P>
	As a resident of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Duncan will not pay  
income tax to the U.S. federal government. Duncan is entering the 
final year of a three-year, $10 million contract he signed as the 
NBA's No. 1 draft pick in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Graphite Electrodes Exec Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A former executive of the world's largest  
producer of graphite electrodes agreed Thursday to plead guilty, 
pay a $1 million fine and serve 9 months in jail for fixing prices 
of a key steel-making component, the Justice Department announced. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the department's antitrust division has brought five  
cases and obtained nearly $300 million in criminal fines from its 
ongoing investigation of price-fixing in the graphite electrode 
industry. Graphite electrodes are the heat source for the 
fastest-growing segment of the U.S. steel industry -- mini-mills -- 
that now account for half of U.S. steel production. 
</P>
<P>
	A criminal case filed in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia  
charged that Robert J. Hart, former senior vice president and chief 
operating officer of UCAR International Inc., conspired in 
violation of the Sherman Act to eliminate competition in the 
industry here and abroad from July 1992 until June 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, steelmakers paid higher prices for graphite  
electrodes used to melt scrap and refine steel for a variety of 
business and consumer items. 
</P>
<P>
	``Imposition of this jail term and fine will send a strong  
message to other executives that participation in cartels which 
prey on U.S. businesses and consumers will not be tolerated and 
will result in severe penalties,'' said Assistant Attorney General 
Joel I. Klein. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said Hart also agreed to cooperate in the  
continuing investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	UCAR itself agreed to plead guilty in April 1998 and paid a  
then-record $110 million fine for the same conspiracy. Since then, 
SGL Carbon AG, a German corporation, was sentenced to pay a $135 
million fine in the case. There also have been three smaller fines 
in the case.

<HEADLINE> US Sudan Missile Strike Challenged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A high-priced team of lawyers, investigators  
and scientists has collected soil samples and other evidence in an 
effort to get the Clinton administration to reimburse a Mideast 
businessman $30 million for the U.S. missile strike against his 
pharmaceutical plant in Sudan. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration already has quietly freed $25 million in  
assets belonging to the plant owner, although it maintains the 
bombing was justified. The strike on Aug. 20, 1998, was based on a 
single soil sample that indicated chemical weapons activity at the 
plant and on a suspected link to accused terrorist leader Osama bin 
Laden. 
</P>
<P>
	But the plant's owner, Salah Idris, a Sudanese citizen with a  
Saudi passport, denies any ties to bin Laden, believed to be in 
Afghanistan. His lawyers say they're awaiting his go-ahead to sue 
if the U.S. government refuses to pay. The administration 
acknowledges it didn't know Idris was the owner when it struck. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are ready to go to trial,'' said lead attorney George  
Salem. ``The plant came out clean and, of course, our client came 
out clean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salem said Idris feels the unfreezing of his assets already  
clears his name of involvement in terrorism, and he is weighing the 
risks of suing the U.S. government, which can suppress evidence 
based on national security interests. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Idris is a great believer in the American system of  
justice,'' Salem said. ``It has vindicated him thus far, and before 
taking this next step, he wishes to make sure that all of his other 
options are exhausted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Idris' plant was destroyed in a cruise missile attack that also  
included strikes on an alleged terrorist training camp in 
Afghanistan -- all in response to the bombings two weeks earlier of 
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people, 
including 12 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Idris contends his factory provided 50 percent of Sudan's basic  
medicines, including treatments for malaria and tuberculosis. 
Sudanese officials say Idris' plant alone saved the government 28 
percent of the hard currency it spends on imported medicines. The 
bombing killed one person was killed and injured several others. 
</P>
<P>
	The government freed Idris' assets in May after he filed an  
earlier lawsuit. Officials said then they still had sensitive 
information about him but weren't willing to reveal it. At the 
time, a senior official told reporters that U.S. agents were 
monitoring Idris and ``his network.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Idris got $24 million the U.S. Treasury had ordered frozen plus  
another $1 million in accumulated interest. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, officials have refused to discuss Idris, even  
in background briefings, citing pending litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last official statement more than one month ago, State  
Department spokesman James Foley acknowledged that U.S. officials 
only learned who owned the plant after the strike. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our actions against the al-Shifa plant were not in any way  
predicated on that person's ownership of the plant,'' said Foley. 
He said it had to do with bin Laden's intentions, his ties to Sudan 
and the discovery at the plant of the chemical Empta, which is used 
in the production of VX nerve gas. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate and House intelligence committees have raised questions  
about the retaliatory strike. Along with the mistaken CIA targeting 
of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade during NATO attacks on 
Yugoslavia, the Khartoum bombing has put a negative spotlight on 
the intelligence agency's role in target planning. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant owner has hired heavyweights to help him.  
</P>
<P>
	Salem leads a group of partners at the high-octane Washington  
firm of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &AMP; Field. He declined to discuss 
costs but described as low an estimate that Idris is paying $3 
million for his U.S. legal work. 
</P>
<P>
	``We put together a first-class team of scientists, chemists,  
environmentalists, experts in every realm, in order to give a 
proper defense,'' Salem said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyers had E. Norbert Garrett, a former CIA station chief  
in Kuwait, investigate Idris' claims and background -- he has been a 
banker and exporter. They also enlisted Thomas D. Tullius, 
chemistry department chairman at Boston University, to direct a 
soil investigation using a British environmental engineer to 
collect samples from the plant and recognized laboratories to test 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to clean soil tests, Salem said a layout of the  
factory shows that dangerous chemicals could not possibly have been 
manufactured there. ``If they were, all the people working on it 
would have been killed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Their suit would demand about $30 million for the plant itself.  
The Sudanese government is reportedly turning the ruins into a 
memorial to remind citizens of the U.S. attack. Washington 
maintains sanctions against Sudan, accusing it of sponsoring 
terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	On the bombing anniversary, Sudan announced completion of two  
similar plants, and Idris is building a $45 million unit in the 
same neighborhood. He says all produce common drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sudan, which denies it support terrorism, also has asked for  
compensation and for a U.N. inquiry into the bombing.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Proposes IMF Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, responding to  
growing criticism about its policies toward Russia, says it will 
push for changes at the International Monetary Fund to make sure 
Russia and other countries don't misuse the billions of dollars the 
IMF provides in loans. 
</P>
<P>
	While insisting the administration's overall approach to Russia  
has been sound, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers unveiled 
proposals Thursday that would call on the IMF to make wider use of 
independent audits and allow the lending agency to impose stiffer 
penalties for countries caught lying. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers said he expected to gain backing for the proposals  
during a meeting Saturday of finance ministers and central bank 
presidents of the world's seven wealthiest countries -- the United 
States, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Britain and Canada. The 
changes would have to be approved by the IMF's governing board. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a huge interest in whether Russia becomes a market  
economy, on whether it stays a democracy,'' Summers said in 
announcing the package of proposed reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	The new requirements are intended to strengthen the IMF's  
ability to guard against the misuse of its loans -- one of the 
allegations that has been made against Russia in a widening 
investigation of corruption and money laundering in that country. 
</P>
<P>
	The package of proposals comes amid renewed criticism from  
Republicans in Congress that the Clinton-backed IMF approach to 
Russian economic reform has been a huge failure. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States will ask that the IMF be required to order  
independent audits of central banks in countries suspected of 
misusing loans. It also wants the IMF to be given greater leeway to 
penalize borrowing countries caught lying to the agency about 
domestic economic conditions and be allowed to impose penalties for 
abuse even after a country has stopped borrowing from the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The G-7 discussions this weekend are being held in advance of  
the annual meetings of the 182-nation International Monetary Fund 
and its sister lending organization, the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets are anticipating that participants also may  
discuss a plan to jointly intervene in currency markets to buy 
dollars in support of the U.S. currency, which is close to a 
44-month low against the Japanese yen. The dollar's weakness has 
unnerved American investors, who fear it will boost the cost of 
imports and add to inflation, and has been cited as a key reason 
for falling U.S. stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers refused to be drawn into a discussion on whether the G-7  
might consider coordinated intervention to support the dollar. He 
said he will stress the need for more balanced global growth -- with 
increased economic activity in Europe and Japan taking the pressure 
off the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	But Summers said Japan's recovery remained uncertain, making it  
critical for the Japanese government to remain committed to 
``continued stimulus, using all available tools'' to boost 
domestic-led demand. 
</P>
<P>
	On another matter., Summers and IMF Managing Director Michel  
Camdessus said they were optimistic that agreement may be reached 
on a plan to increase the amount of debt relief provided to the 
world's 41 poorest nations. A the key elements of the plan is the 
sale of 14 million ounces of the IMF's gold reserves to IMF member 
countries, rather than on the open market, and use the proceeds to 
forgive debt held by these countries.

<HEADLINE> Bucks Said Interested in Rodman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE, Wis. (AP) -- Dennis Rodman's agent says the Milwaukee  
Bucks are interested in signing the 6-foot-8 forward and that ``The 
Worm'' is listening. 
</P>
<P>
	The colorful and controversial Rodman is searching for a new  
team and Milwaukee is under consideration, his Los Angeles-based 
agent Steven Chasman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I spoke to Milwaukee and they did express interest,'' Chasman  
told The Journal Times of Racine. ``Dennis and I have talked about 
playing in Milwaukee and Dennis isn't opposed to doing that. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a good team and he wants to play for a good team.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bucks general manager Ernie Grunfeld said he was happy to hear  
people want to play for his team. 
</P>
<P>
	Grunfeld called Rodman one of the game's greatest rebounders and  
declined further comment on whether he might like to hire him. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman was a member of two championship teams with the Detroit  
Pistons and three with the Chicago Bulls. He holds an NBA record of 
seven consecutive seasons of leading the NBA in rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman has said he wants to return to the Los Angeles Lakers,  
who released him last April. Lakers vice president Jerry West has 
said he considered the Rodman chapter closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman is also believed to be looking at the Los Angeles  
Clippers, Miami, New Jersey, Dallas, Houston and Atlanta, a list 
that Chasman declined to confirm.

<HEADLINE> Stations Turn to Web Broadcasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- This past summer, if you were a baseball fan in  
search of Florida Marlins' highlights, you might tune in to WPEC's 
11 p.m. newscast -- or log on to its Web site to watch a simulcast. 
</P>
<P>
	Not anymore. Major League Baseball has cried ``Foul!'' -- and  
copyright infringement -- forcing the station in West Palm Beach, 
Fla., and others around the country to stop broadcasting on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Disputes over Internet programming rights, though still rare,  
are on the rise as more radio and TV stations run their 
over-the-air feeds on the Web as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is technology is always way ahead of the law,''  
said Kathleen Kirby, a lawyer for the Radio-Television News 
Directors Association, a Washington-based industry group. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet broadcasts generally mirror those sent over the  
airwaves, so some stations do not see the need for additional 
rights. But distributors of sports and entertainment programming 
say their contracts spell out permitted uses and automatically 
prohibit everything else. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball contracts go a step further and include a clause that  
specifically bans Internet broadcasts, even Internet broadcasts of 
highlights. The baseball league found several violators, and 
lawyers stopped the Web broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's starting to come up this season,'' said Michael Mellis,  
new media counsel for Major League Baseball Enterprises, the 
licensing division. ``Our game footage is copyrighted, and our 
intellectual property is valuable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	WPEC, which started Web simulcasts of local news shows on June  
21, has since eliminated its entire sports segment from the Web 
version. The station also disabled the Internet archives of past 
news shows because they contain baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, it's no different than re-broadcasting your news on  
cable,'' said Doreen Wade, WPEC's general manager. ``I don't see 
what the big deal is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A sister station, WWMT in Kalamazoo, Mich., initially stopped  
running baseball highlights on its over-the-air newscasts after 
learning of the Internet restriction. The station has since 
restored baseball to regular broadcast but keeps footage off the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really surprised that it became an issue because it's not  
a revenue-driven thing at all here,'' said Al Forist, the station's 
operations manager. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Web service costs more money than it generates, so  
WWMT does not want to pay for separate rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Football League currently permits Web simulcasts of  
highlights for one-time usage but prohibits video broadcasts of 
entire games on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro basketball officials found a few radio stations that carried  
live feeds of games over the Internet but the stations stopped 
after they were contacted by the National Basketball Association. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Adam Silver, president of NBA Entertainment, said given  
the scope of the Internet, ``it's so difficult to police.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Restrictions extend to non-sports programming as well.  
</P>
<P>
	Premiere Radio Networks, a syndicator of radio programming,  
allows Web simulcasts for some shows, but not for lucrative 
holdings such as Rush Limbaugh and Dr. Laura Schlessinger. Premiere 
worked out a licensing agreement with broadcast.com, a site through 
which stations offer simulcasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Radio feeds through broadcast.com began in 1995. The site now  
has programming from 500 radio and 65 TV stations. Yahoo! Inc., 
which runs the site, expects continued growth as better technology 
makes quality feeds possible. 
</P>
<P>
	The company routinely checks with stations to make sure they  
have the proper rights. Difficulties primarily arise, Yahoo! Vice 
President Kevin Parke said, when the contract says nothing on the 
scope of the rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's a question, we try to go ahead and work with the  
rights holder,'' Parke said. ``The last thing we want to do is 
violate anyone's copyright.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Wharton, spokesman for the Washington-based National  
Association of Broadcasters, said broadcasters are sorting through 
the legal ramifications. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a brave new world we're entering.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Takes Issue With Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton took a swipe at Republican  
front-runner George W. Bush over tax cuts Friday and reminded 
voters that the United States was jolted by a recession during the 
last Republican administration -- when Bush's father was president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's take just a little walk down memory lane here, shall  
we?'' Clinton said in partisan speech that delighted the Democratic 
National Committee's annual fall meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, I saw a survey the other day that said that times  
had been so good for so long, the American people couldn't remember 
when it was bad and tended to give everybody good ratings on the 
economy -- Bush, Hoover, the whole crowd,'' Clinton said to 
Democratic laughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Underscoring his point, Clinton repeated practically the same  
line later in a separate speech to Democratic businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
	The president also suggested that Vice President Al Gore should  
not be disheartened by recent polls showing him running neck and 
neck with Democratic rival Bill Bradley in New Hampshire and New 
York, and behind Republican Gov. Bush nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a long time between now and November of 2000,'' the  
president said. ``In June of 1992, you know where I was in the 
polls? Not behind. Third. Third.'' He said he would never forget 
his comeback victory in California primary June 2, 1992, and 
subsequent successes in New Jersey and Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Americans are not paying attention to politics now, Clinton  
said. ``For most people,'' he said, ``the election is not going on. 
If you live in Iowa or New Hampshire, it's already going on. If you 
live in Arkansas, you're still worried about the price of cattle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Clinton generally has refrained from attacking Gov.  
Bush, he knocked the Republican presidential hopeful for saying he 
would have signed the Republicans' $792 billion tax cut bill. 
Clinton voted the bill Thursday -- the same day Bush promised to 
increase military pay, accelerate high-tech weaponry and develop an 
anti-missile system. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I thought to myself,'' Clinton said, ``this is a nice  
speech but if I sign this tax bill that (Bush) is for, there won't 
be any money for the promise he just made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton suggested Bush should be thankful for the veto, which is  
likely to boost the already soaring budget surplus. ``I need to 
quit helping these Republicans this way,'' Clinton joked. The 
president playfully lamented that he has helped Bush build a huge 
campaign warchest. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, my economy has made it possible for those  
Republicans to give George Bush all that money,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush did not seem perturbed by the attention.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm flattered that once again the president has taken time  
from his busy schedule to talk about me and my policies, even 
before I've won my party's nomination,'' Bush told The Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the projected surpluses,'' Bush said, ``I believe  
America's military can be strengthened and our taxes cut. This 
unprecendeted attention by the Clinton-Gore administration must 
mean they're extremely worried about my candidacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While many Americans are basking in prosperous times, Clinton  
used his two speeches to recall the economic downturn under Bush's 
father, President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``And lo and behold,'' Clinton said, '' after the '88 election,  
we found ourselves in the worst recession since the Great 
Depression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he and Gore set out to fix the economy. ``And now  
we have the longest peacetime expansion in our history instead of 
the worst recession since the Great Depression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, Clinton's recollection was incorrect. The 1981-82  
recession during the Reagan administration was the worst since the 
Depression. In comparison, the 1990-91 recession during the Bush 
administration was relatively mild.

	Bank of Scotland Bids for NatWest  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Bank of Scotland PLC today launched a hostile  
$34.3 billion takeover bid for National Westminster Bank PLC. 
NatWest, which is three times bigger than Bank of Scotland, quickly 
rejected the offer, and its shares soared as analysts speculated 
that other bidders might join the pursuit. Even though the offer 
would represent Britain's biggest bank merger, ``It's not a 
knockout bid. It's feasible someone could come in with a higher 
bid,'' said David Liston, analyst at Capel Cure Sharp. NatWest's 
U.S. shares rose 27.5 percent on the New York Stock Exchange, 
surging $27.81 1/4 to close at $128.81 1/4. Bank of Scotland shares were

Daimler-Benz. Thomas Stallkamp, the president of the Chrysler

will give up his seat on DaimlerChrysler's management board, and be 
replaced as head of Chrysler by James Holden, executive vice

	Sales of Existing Homes Off 2.8 Pct

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sales of existing homes fell in August for the  
second straight month after hitting a record high in June. Still, 
sales are on track for a banner year. The National Association of 
Realtors said today that sales of existing single-family homes 
decreased by 2.8 percent in August to a seasonally adjusted annual 
rate of 5.25 million units. Rising interest rates were believed a 
major factor. August's sales level was the lowest since May when 5 
million units were sold. The 2.8 percent decline in August, 
followed a 4 percent drop in sales in July. In June, sales hit an 
all-time high of 5.63 million units sold.

trading Monday, and traders expect shares to fall as far as the 
rules allow. Since the quake struck, many traders around the island 
have been unable to work because their electronic dealing systems 
had no power. There was little information available about damage 
sustained by listed companies. The extent of the fallout is still 
far from clear. Analysts say the main question they have is not

nation's largest publicly held insurance company also revised its 
fourth-quarter earnings downward sharply. But an analyst said 
losses from Floyd should have a minimal effect on the insurance 
industry, noting the other reasons cited by Allstate for its 
revision. Allstate said third-quarter operating earnings would be 
50 cents to 55 cents per share -- down from 76 cents for the same 
period a year ago and well under the 78 cents that an analysts' 
consensus had anticipated. Allstate shares were down 3 1/2 at 28 1/4.

following the death of John F. Kennedy Jr., its charismatic founder 
and editor. There had been concerns as to whether the four-year-old 
magazine could survive without him. Kennedy died in a plane crash 
in July. Hachette Filipacchi Magazines, which shared ownership of 
the magazine with Kennedy, announced Friday the magazine would cut 
back to 10 issues a year from 12 next year but would guarantee 
advertisers a larger circulation. And starting with the February 
2000 issue, advertisers are being promised circulation of 450,000 
per issue of the magazine that mixed political commentary and 
celebrity profiles, up 12.5 percent from the current 400,000.

	Relief Agency Criticizes IMF  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund is failing to  
complete its mission of reducing poverty in the world's poorest 
nations and needs a radical overhaul, the international relief 
agency Oxfam said today. It suggested a radical overhaul of the 
IMF. A report by the group said IMF programs in developing 
countries not only are failing to spur economic growth but also are 
fostering deep cuts in spending on public health and education. 
Among other things, it faults governments of major industrialized 
countries, which control the IMF, for continuing to insist that 
poor countries comply with IMF programs as a condition for 
receiving foreign aid and debt relief.

<HEADLINE> Higher Census Cost Confirmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The increased workload caused by the ban on  
using sampling to take next year's census is the main factor in a 
$1.7 billion boost in the count's cost, the General Accounting 
Office reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The extra funds were sought by the Census Bureau following the  
Supreme Court decision banning statistical sampling in developing 
numbers used to redistribute seats in the House of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress asked the GAO, its investigative arm, to study the  
request, which would be an addition to the original $2.8 billion 
Census budget request. 
</P>
<P>
	Census Director Kenneth Prewitt welcomed the report, saying,  
``We are gratified that our serious and methodical work on the 
budget for this revised plan has been thoroughly examined by GAO.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Challenging the conclusion was Rep. Dan Miller, chairman of the  
House Government Reform subcommittee on the census. 
</P>
<P>
	He charged that the Census Bureau had lowered its productivity  
estimates without justification and failed to calculate possible 
savings if advertising increases the census mail response rate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The GAO report has raised some serious concerns about how the  
Census Bureau will spend their mammoth budget,'' Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., ranking minority member of the  
subcommittee, said the report ``verified the accuracy of the Census 
Bureau's financial plan.'' She hoped Congress would provide full 
funding for the count. 
</P>
<P>
	Inability to use sampling to estimate people not counted means  
the bureau will have to send enumerators to visit an estimated 12 
million more households that fail to return their questionnaire by 
mail than had originally been planned, GAO noted. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the Census Bureau will have to add several  
programs to improve coverage, such as revisiting some counted 
households to check the accuracy of the information collected. 
</P>
<P>
	In its request for additional funds the Census Bureau estimated  
that enumerators would be able to visit 1.03 households per hour, a 
reduction from previous estimates of 1.28 per hour. GAO termed that 
a ``very conservative'' estimate and Miller contended the reduction 
was unjustified. 
</P>
<P>
	The need to visit more homes coupled with the anticipated  
reduction in efficiency means that the bureau will have to hire 
1,350,000 temporary workers to do the count, up from original plans 
of 780,000, GAO noted. 
</P>
<P>
	The new estimate also increased advertising costs $72 million in  
an effort to increase the number of people who mail back their 
questionnaires. If that works, GAO noted, fewer homes would have to 
be visited later, potentially reducing costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Census Bureau had planned to use statistical sampling in the  
2000 count, contending that it would save money and be more 
accurate than the 1990 effort, which, later checks indicated, had 
some 12.8 million errors -- missing 8.4 million and double-counting 
4.4 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	With sampling, more than 90 percent of Americans would be  
counted directly and the results would be used to estimate those 
not counted. 
</P>
<P>
	But the plan was challenged by Republicans in Congress and the  
Supreme Court in January agreed that sampling did not satisfy the 
requirements for numbers used in apportionment. 
</P>
<P>
	Census Day is April 1. Questionnaires will be sent to some 100  
million households, and enumerators will hit the streets to track 
down those who fail to respond.

<HEADLINE>  IOC Defending Anti-Drug Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Seven months after holding an international  
conference on the escalating drug crisis in sports, the IOC is 
facing roadblocks to its plans for a world antidoping agency and a 
new antidoping code. 
</P>
<P>
	White House drug czar Barry McCaffrey said Wednesday the IOC's  
drug agency project is unacceptable, claiming it lacked 
transparency, accountability and independence, and maintained ``the 
Byzantine elements of the current IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not the first time McCaffrey and the IOC have locked horns.  
At the antidrug summit in February, IOC officials responded to 
McCaffrey's criticism by telling him to solve the serious doping 
problem in American sports before lecturing the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Pound, an IOC vice president spearheading the antidoping  
agency project, said he would write to McCaffrey to contest his 
latest remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little disappointed with his approach,'' Pound said in a  
telephone interview. ``It ignores a lot of good work that has been 
done leading to an international consensus for the agency. That's 
what we promised at the world conference and that's what we've 
delivered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jacques Rogge, an IOC executive board official, accused  
McCaffrey of ignoring that the agency plans have been backed by 
European governments, the United Nations, World Health Organization 
and other bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that's not a strong political agreement, I don't know what  
is,'' he said. ``If Gen. McCaffrey is not happy, he better consult 
with the other governments who have given their approval. He should 
not point the finger at the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The drug agency is designed to coordinate drug testing around  
the world, including unannounced out-of-competition controls. The 
IOC, which is putting up $25 million to get the agency started, has 
promised it will be established by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC director general Francois Carrard said a Swiss foundation,  
run by a board of directors consisting of government and sports 
officials, would be set up shortly to manage the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Several contentious issues remain to be decided -- namely where  
the agency will be located and who will run it. Critics, like 
McCaffrey, say the agency should be completely independent of the 
IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Lausanne, Switzerland, where the IOC is based, is one of the  
possible sites being considered for the agency's headquarters. 
Other cities which have expressed interest include Vienna, Austria; 
Madrid, Spain; Lisbon, Portugal, and Stockholm, Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the agency's tasks will be to apply the IOC's  
controversial new ``Olympic Movement Anti-Doping Code.'' The 
95-page document sets out guidelines on drug testing, sanctions, 
rules and procedures for all Olympic sports. 
</P>
<P>
	The code, approved by the IOC at its session in Seoul, South  
Korea, in June, is scheduled to go into effect Jan. 1. But it has 
come under attack from several leading Olympic officials. 
</P>
<P>
	John Coates, president of the Australian Olympic Committee,  
recently sent a 12-page letter to IOC president Juan Antonio 
Samaranch criticizing the code as ``unworkable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coates, a lawyer, found numerous holes in the document,  
including flaws in the definitions of doping and trafficking and 
failure to fully address the issue of out-of-competition testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound, who drafted the document along with fellow IOC vice  
president Keba Mbaye of Senegal, said the code is a ``work in 
progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not perfect,'' Pound said. ``No document in this field  
will ever be perfect. If any changes should or will be made, they 
ought to be made at the behest of the agency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senior officials of two major Olympic sports, track and field  
and swimming, have expressed serious reservations about the code. 
</P>
<P>
	Gunnar Werner, honorary secretary of the international swimming  
federation, said he agreed with many of Coates' complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope (the document) will be delayed or reconsidered,'' he  
said. ``The main problem is it completely changes the whole system 
of sanctions. It conflicts with our rules. At the moment, we would 
not be able to apply it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arne Ljungqvist, chairman of the International Amateur Athletic  
Federation's medical commission, said his federation would also 
need to change its rules, noting that the next IAAF congress won't 
be held until 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The code lists a scale of sanctions for drug offenses, including  
``intentional doping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For example, recommended penalties for a first offense for use  
of stimulants or other minor substances are: a warning, a ban from 
one or several competitions, a fine of up to $100,000, and a 
suspension of one one to six months. 
</P>
<P>
	For intentional doping with steroids, the listed penalties are:  
life ban from participation in any sports event, fine of up to $1 
million, suspension of four years to life from all sports 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Werner and Ljungqvist questioned how sports officials will be  
able to prove intentional doping. According to the document, 
intentional doping can be proved ``by any means whatsoever, 
including presumption.''

	Kinkel Pleads Guilty to Murder  
</P>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Kip Kinkel, 17, abandoned an insanity  
defense and plead guilty today to murdering his parents at home and 
then shooting to death two classmates at Springfield's Thurston 
High School. He faces a potential life sentence. Kinkel had told 
investigators after his arrest that he had ``no choice'' but to 
kill after shaming his parents by getting expelled from school. His 
attorneys thought that by proving he was insane, or at least not in 
control of his actions, they could spare him life in prison. 
Because he was just 15 at the time of the crimes, Kinkel never 
faced the death penalty.

	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- Outflanked politically by the United  
Nations and outgunned by international peacekeepers, Indonesia's 
demoralized military is withdrawing from East Timor with little 
grace. Determined not to leave anything behind, soldiers are 
vandalizing and setting fire to their barracks before departing, 
leaving live ammunition behind to explode in the heat. Some delight 
in scaring already-terrorized Timorese civilians by firing shots in 
the air. Others stare sullenly from the backs of trucks hauling 
them, their families and possessions past makeshift refugee camps 
to waiting ships and planes.

	PERUGIA, Italy (AP) -- A jury today acquitted former Premier  
Giulio Andreotti of the 1979 murder of an Italian journalist. After 
a three-year trial and four days of deliberations, the jury of two 
judges and six private citizens concluded there was no proof to 
convict Andreotti, 80, one of Italy's most powerful and enduring 
politicians. Andreotti, who was premier seven times and is a 
senator-for-life, was indicted for premeditated murder along with 
five other people in the 1979 slaying of journalist Mino Pecorelli.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Shuffles Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler's North American chief retired as  
part of a management shakeup Friday, putting the company's German 
executives in even more dominant roles. The shuffle raised new 
questions about the ultimate success of the merger of Chrysler 
Corp. and Daimler-Benz AG. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler's profits have been disappointing and its stock  
is at a 52-week low. Industry analysts, while saying the moves 
weren't surprising, wondered if Chrysler's freewheeling corporate 
culture will be stifled by a more rigid Daimler management system. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's this view within this company that there's Chrysler  
guys and there's Daimler guys,'' said Rod Lache, an analyst with 
Deutsche Bank Securities in New York. ``Although the functions have 
been integrated, the cultures haven't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the moves announced Friday, Thomas Stallkamp, the  
president of the Chrysler division and a 19-year Chrysler veteran, 
will retire Dec. 31. He will give up his seat on DaimlerChrysler's 
management board, and be replaced as head of Chrysler by James 
Holden, executive vice president for sales and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	Co-chairmen Juergen Schrempp and Robert Eaton also announced  
that the management board would be trimmed from 17 to 14. In 
addition to Stallkamp, another Chrysler executive and two former 
Daimler-Benz AG executives will lose their seats. One former 
Daimler executive will join the board. All the moves are effective 
Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The new board will focus its automotive tasks in three areas --  
Chrysler cars and trucks, Mercedes-Benz vehicles and commercial 
trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Schrempp and Eaton have said the board needed to be pruned once  
the first part of the merger was complete. Eaton said Friday the 
move would allow the company to move faster, and was not a shift in 
power towards one side of the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't a German or American thing,'' he said. ``This is  
one company striving to be the No. 1 automotive transportation 
company in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of the merger in November 1998, Chrysler was known  
for having a more progressive, open culture. It was credited with 
innovations such as the first minivan, and vehicles such as the 
retro Chrysler PT Cruiser, due out next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding that style to the more traditional, top-down management  
culture of Daimler-Benz AG was supposed to help both companies by 
improving Chrysler's quality while helping Daimler expand its reach 
outside luxury cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Eaton and Schrempp portrayed it as a marriage of equals, keeping  
dual headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany and Auburn Hills, Mich., 
outside Detroit. They also acknowledged the risks: Their own study 
of transnational mergers found 70 percent failed to achieve the 
kind of success that was anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	And one of the stars of the merger was Stallkamp. Before  
becoming president of Chrysler in January 1998, he was credited 
with helping the company shed billions in costs, and was expected 
to help the German side do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	The 53-year-old executive threw himself into making the merger  
work. He took German language classes, learned how to criss-cross 
the Atlantic in a day without jet lag and sent out scores of 
e-mails to employees with questions about the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The folks at Daimler-Benz and the folks at Chrysler are a lot  
more alike than you might think,'' he said in an interview last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	But in recent months, there have been signs of trouble in the  
marriage. In July, DaimlerChrysler announced lower-than-expected 
earnings, even though U.S. car buyers are on track to set an 
all-time record for yearly sales. The company said losses due to 
the Smart small cars sold in Europe, a weak Euro and trouble in 
Latin America dragged profits down. 
</P>
<P>
	Those concerns pushed the company's stock down from about $90 to  
about $75. News of Stallkamp's departure help send the stock to its 
all-time low Thursday of $66.25. It was up 3.2 percent Friday on 
the New York Stock Exchange, or by $2.12 1/2, to close at $68.37 1/2 a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	Stallkamp ``was an icon of the old Chrysler Corp.,'' Lache said.  
``He was also very vocal since the merger and fairly critical of 
certain programs that didn't have a strong business position, such 
as Smart. He echoed shareholders views well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christian Breitsprecher, auto analyst at Deutsche Morgan  
Grenfell in Frankfurt, said the move consolidated Schrempp's power 
over the company. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to realize that this was never a 'merger of equals'  
to start with,'' he said. ``In the end it was clear that Schrempp 
would have the say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others said that since Eaton is scheduled to retire in a few  
years, Schrempp had already established himself as the company's 
leader, and the move was just another part of shuffling two 
companies together. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, the authority resides in Stuttgart,'' said Alan  
Baum, an analyst with IRN Inc. ``None of this is surprising -- that 
certain people didn't carry through. But I don't think anybody 
would have said a year ago that Stallkamp would not carry 
through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scott F. Merliss, an analyst with Wasserstein Perella Securites  
Inc. in New York, upgraded his view of the company after the 
announcement Friday, saying the company had a lot of profitable 
cars and trucks on the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sad to see Tom go, but they have great products with great  
earnings,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In an e-mail to employees, Stallkamp said he had left on good  
terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``In any merger, issues may arise as a result of different  
styles or corporate cultures. But, these issues have been worked 
out, and will be worked out in the future, because they are not the 
result of personalities or national differences,'' Stallkamp said.

<HEADLINE> Gay Cleric Resigns From N.J. Parish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A gay priest whose ordination divided the  
Episcopal church has left the parish where he ministered for six 
years, blaming the controversy that surrounded him. 
</P>
<P>
	Rev. Barry Stopfel said the furor strained his relationship with  
his partner, and preached his last sermon at St. George's Church in 
Maplewood on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``My ministry has not been a typical one,'' Stopfel told The  
Star-Ledger of Newark in a story published today. ``It has been 
deeply gratifying but very stressful, and it has taken its toll on 
me and our marriage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Stopfel was ordained as a deacon in 1990, conservative  
Episcopal bishops filed heresy charges against Newark Bishop Walter 
Righter. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Court Nixes Late-Term Abortion Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A federal appeals court ruled Friday that bans  
on a type of late-term abortion in three Midwestern states were 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	A panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled  
separately on cases from Nebraska, Arkansas and Iowa, issuing all 
three rulings the same day because the cases were so similar. The 
cases involve the procedure that opponents call ``partial-birth 
abortion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three states are among 28 that have adopted bans of the  
procedure since 1995, although the courts have blocked or limited 
enforcement in 19 of those states. In 1997, President Clinton 
vetoed a national late-term abortion ban. The House voted to 
override, but the Senate sustained the veto. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Midwestern cases, the court cited concerns about the  
vagueness of the laws -- measures that the judges believed could be 
read to prohibit common abortion procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	``The central difficulty with the Arkansas statute is that it  
covers too much,'' Chief Judge Richard Arnold wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Nebraska case, Arnold wrote that the law ``would prohibit  
in many circumstances the most common method of second-trimester 
abortion. Such a prohibition places an undue burden on the right of 
women to choose whether to have an abortion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The court's ruling confirms that the entire campaign to ban  
'partial-birth abortion' -- a campaign that has consumed Congress 
and the federal courts for over three years -- is nothing but a 
fraud designed to rob American women of their right to abortion,'' 
said Janet Benshoof, president of Center for Reproductive Law and 
Policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska Attorney General Don Stenberg said he would appeal, and  
Janet Parshall, spokeswoman for the Family Research Council, said: 
``U.S. Supreme Court -- here we come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The abortion procedure involves partially extracting a fetus,  
legs first, through the birth canal, cutting the skull and draining 
the contents.

<HEADLINE> World Stocks Fall After U.S. Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices ended moderately lower on Wall Street  
today in a volatile session that saw stocks try in vain to regain 
some of the massive losses they suffered earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average, down more than 505 points over  
the previous three sessions, lost an additional 39.26 and closed at 
10,279.33. The index changed course several times during the 
session. The Dow fell more than 127 points in morning trading, 
recovered to move into positive territory and then dropped more 
than 131 points in afternoon trading before recovering somewhat at 
the close. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow finished the week 524.30 points below last Friday's  
close, a loss of 4.9 percent. It has now dropped 9.2 percent from 
its record high close of 11,326.04, set Aug. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks also fell in overseas trading. Frankfurt's Xetra DAX  
index fell 2.13 percent and the CAC index in Paris fell 1.31 
percent. In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange index closed 
with a decline of 0.54 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock  
Average dropped 454.03 points, or 2.62 percent. The Tokyo exchange 
was closed for a holiday Thursday, and today's slide followed a 
drop of 3.4 percent in share values on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks plunged Thursday in heavy selling on Wall Street as  
investors worried about higher interest rates and the strength of 
the dollar. A warning from Microsoft president Steve Ballmer that 
technology stocks are overvalued robbed the market of what had been 
a big source of strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street was also uneasy about the weakness of the dollar and  
the possibility of a third increase in U.S. interest rates this 
year. The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meets Oct. 5 to 
assess inflation and the economy and decide whether rates should be 
pushed higher once more. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said they expected the market to remain uncertain until  
after the Fed meeting.

<HEADLINE> Unearthed Coffins Collected in N.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TARBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Coast Guardsmen plied the 20-foot  
floodwaters of eastern North Carolina on Friday, trying to snag 
scores of coffins that popped out of the ground after Hurricane 
Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, a team of funeral home directors will begin  
identifying the wayward caskets to help get them back to what were 
supposed to be their final resting places. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're doing this to ensure that all the caskets are identified  
so that we can notify their loved ones,'' said Coast Guard Lt. 
Scott Bates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard crews spent the day in Princeville, across the  
Tar River from Tarboro, trying to round up as many as 100 airtight 
caskets that were forced from the ground by the river's 
floodwaters. 
</P>
<P>
	Too heavy to pull onto boats, the caskets were either towed to  
shore or tied to trees as Coast Guard crews recorded their 
locations. All appeared to be sealed. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers' ID numbers on the caskets can be traced to  
funeral homes and ultimately the families who bought them, but the 
bodies still must be identified and the coffins repaired before 
they are reburied, said Buddy Bell, a mortuary liaison officer for 
the U.S. Public Health Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Identifying the bodies could be as simple as a relative  
describing the clothing the person was buried in or it could 
require the use of dental records, officials said. Family members 
won't be asked to make visual identifications. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to be able to positively identify the person and  
assure the family they are getting their loved ones back,'' Bell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Search crews, meanwhile, used dogs trained to detect bodies to  
look for victims of the floodwaters that swallowed Princeville, a 
town of 1,900, a week ago. At least 42 deaths have been blamed on 
Hurricane Floyd in eastern North Carolina alone, and the numbers 
could rise as floodwaters recede. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the river in downtown Tarboro, some business owners were  
finally able to get into their stores for the first time since 
floodwaters forced them to evacuate Sept. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Rex Browning, 66, remained upbeat as he cleaned up his jewelry  
store five blocks from the river. The paneling was wilted 4 feet up 
the wall, marking the floodwaters' high point. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started here 42 years ago with nothing, so I guess I have  
more than that now,'' Browning said as he examined broken watches. 
</P>
<P>
	A stench filled the air and some people wore masks over their  
mouths and noses. Murky water poured into the streets from whirring 
pumps emptying businesses. Wet carpeting, twisted furniture and 
other items littered the sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the day, dump trucks and other heavy construction  
equipment rumbled down the muddy streets. 
</P>
<P>
	Donna Webb's office supply store was open again, thanks to a  
4-foot-high concrete dam she had built a week ago in front of the 
place. ``It was almost as hard to tear down as it was to build,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a week after 20 inches of rain fell on parts of the  
state, emergency management officials said 2,700 people remained in 
24 shelters. Preliminary damage estimates released by the state 
showed about 7,000 homes had been damaged and more than 600 had 
been destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Utility crews were able to restore power to nearly all the 1.5  
million people who lost electricity. But it could be at least two 
weeks before classes resume in all the school districts affected by 
the flooding. Eleven districts with about 176,000 students remained 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some cases the schools are OK, but the communities are  
gone,'' said Ben Matthews, state director of school support. ``In 
other cases, the community is all right, but the road to the school 
is washed out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a visit to Greenville, Gov. Jim Hunt pledged to find the  
money for repairs and improvements so the region isn't ravaged by 
flooding again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to fix up something and have it happen again two  
years from now,'' he said. ``This time, fix it right.''

<HEADLINE> Gun Control Agreement Said Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde  
said Thursday that negotiators were close to agreement on 
legislation to tighten gun control and safety laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The Illinois Republican said that while one or two issues remain  
to be resolved, negotiators have agreed on provisions to bar minors 
from possessing assault weapons, ban certain large scale ammunition 
clips and require ``reasonable'' mandatory background checks for 
purchases, including those at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	There would also be provisions for safety devices and trigger  
locks and a lifetime ban on the purchase of a handgun by anyone 
convicted of a gun-related felony as a juvenile, Hyde said. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the high school shootings in Colorado in the spring,  
the Senate passed a juvenile crime bill that included a series of 
gun control provisions. But the House version left out the gun 
measures after some Republicans argued they were too strong and 
some Democrats asserted they were too weak. 
</P>
<P>
	A House-Senate conference to work out differences in the two  
bills has stalled for several months over the gun control issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde spoke during debate on a motion by Rep. Carolyn McCarthy,  
D-N.Y., to urge the House-Senate negotiators to meet in open 
sessions beginning Friday and continuing until a compromise was 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarthy said negotiators needed an incentive to move forward.  
``I fear the delays we have faced have been caused by the 
congressional leadership's reluctance to enact meaningful gun 
safety legislation,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hyde argued that informal meetings have been taking place on  
a daily basis. ``Nobody wants this to fail. Give credence to our 
good faith.'' A vote on the motion was scheduled for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Thursday, the House approved, by 305-117, another  
measure offered by Democrats to guide the House-Senate negotiators. 
That motion recommended that the final version of the juvenile 
crime bill include language to close loopholes allowing criminals 
to obtain guns at gun shows and from non-licensed dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	It also said the bill should not include language that weaken  
current gun safety law and that it should aid in enforcing current 
laws against criminals who use guns.

<HEADLINE> Reggie May Join Bid To Buy Angels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson, already part of  
a group trying to buy the Oakland Athletics, said he might be 
interested in entering a group bidding for the Anaheim Angels. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson said he has discussed joining billionaires Henry  
Nicholas III and Henry Samueli in their attempt to buy the Angels 
from Disney. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know Nicholas and Samueli and we have had a short visit,''  
Jackson told The Los Angeles Times. ``I'd certainly be interested, 
but there is nothing concrete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The slugger said he has met with Nicholas, president and chief  
executive officer of the Irvine-based semiconductor group Broadcom 
Corp., and Samueli, Broadcom's co-chairman and vice president, to 
discuss the possibility of his involvement if they were to buy the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's role could perhaps be as an investor and as an  
executive in the team's front office, the newspaper said. The 
report did not specify when the three had discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Nicholas and a small group of investors,  
including Samueli, were reportedly close to a signing a letter of 
intent to buy the Angels and Mighty Ducks from the Walt Disney Co. 
for between $400 million and $500 million. Both Disney and Broadcom 
declined to comment on that report. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcom did not return calls from The Associated Press about  
Jackson's possible involvement. Disney spokeswoman Chris Castro 
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Tavares, president of Disney subsidiary Anaheim Sports  
Inc., responded last week to sale rumors at the baseball owners 
meetings in New York. He acknowledged that Disney had been 
approached from people interested in the teams and said the company 
was ``in a listening mode.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Any deal involving the Angels would need the approval of Major  
League Baseball. Tavares said last week that talks weren't at the 
stage where the team would seek permission from the commissioner's 
office to share its financial information with possible investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney bought the Angels for $140 million three years ago. The  
company also paid a $50 million franchise fee for the hockey team. 
However, both teams have not been big money makers. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest development in the speculation of the Angels' sale  
has the added wrinkle of bringing in a renowned baseball player who 
already has ties to the team. Jackson played on two of the team's 
three division winners during five years with the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson is currently director of new business alliances for  
Viking Components, which makes computer memory. He is also a 
principal of Ulico Insurance Group of Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson has been involved in a group seeking to buy the A's, but  
major league owners recently shelved the deal, pending a report of 
a committee studying the sport's economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson told the Times he would be available to join Nicholas'  
investment group because he considered the A's purchase to be a 
dead issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Angels represent a great brand in a great market,''  
Jackson said. ``They've had a difficult year and will still draw 
more than 2 million. It's all there. They just need some strategic 
direction.''

<HEADLINE> Ovarian Implant Called Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Young women left infertile due to cancer or  
other ailments may someday have children thanks to an experimental 
ovarian tissue transplant that gave a menopausal woman the ability 
to produce eggs. 
</P>
<P>
	A 30-year-old woman suffering from early menopause was able to  
ovulate and have a normal menstrual period after undergoing the 
landmark surgery at New York Methodist Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Kutluk Oktay, who performed the operation, said the surgery  
gives new hope for young infertile women, especially women who had 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's probably the best news they can have,'' Oktay said  
Thursday. ``After they hear they have cancer, there is someone 
telling them they may have hope for the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Kutluk Oktay performed the procedure in February on Margaret  
Lloyd-Hart in the hopes of reversing symptoms of menopause brought 
on by the removal of her ovaries. The organs were taken out for 
medical reasons, although the specifics were not made public. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lloyd-Hart, a dancer from Tucson, Ariz., had some of her  
ovarian tissue preserved through freezing after her second ovary 
was removed two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors used miniature instruments and robotic equipment to  
implant the tissue through three tiny holes in the patient's 
pelvis. 
</P>
<P>
	Four months after the procedure, Oktay gave Ms. Lloyd-Hart  
fertility drugs to test ovarian function. She developed an egg, 
ovulated, and had a normal menstrual period, Oktay said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case indicates that we are on the cusp of safe, reliable  
transplantation of human ovarian tissue,'' said Larry Lipshultz, 
president of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. ``This 
should give great hope to women suffering from ovarian and other 
cancers, and may lead to successful treatment for other causes of 
infertility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lloyd-Hart is on hormone replacement therapy in Arizona, and  
there is no way to check whether she is continuing to ovulate until 
she returns to New York in a couple of months for a follow-up exam, 
the doctor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Oktay will be presenting his work next week at a meeting of the  
American Society for Reproductive Medicine in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Cancer Society estimates that 25,200 women will be  
diagnosed with ovarian cancer this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only can the disease damage ovaries, but some treatments for  
cancer, like chemotherapy, can cause damage as well. If the new 
procedure proves successful, such women could potentially have 
their ovaries removed, be treated for cancer and then have the 
ovaries re-implanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Oktay said he recommended that the procedure be initially  
focused on young women facing cancer, rather than otherwise healthy 
older women looking to delay or reverse menopause. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't recommend for someone over 30 to have an ovary  
taken out to be put back at a later stage,'' Oktay said.

<HEADLINE> Fox Appeals Ruling on Turner Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Fox Sports Net South is appealing a lower court  
ruling that allowed Turner South, a new regional network, to 
broadcast Atlanta baseball, football and hockey games. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Rowland  
Barnes denied Fox Sports' request for an injunction. The network 
was attempting to prevent Turner South from including the 
Thrashers, Hawks and Braves as part of its programming lineup, 
beginning Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox filed its appeal Thursday with the Georgia Supreme Court and  
said in a statement that it ``intends to pursue all legal and 
equitable remedies available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No date has been set for a briefing in the matter, at which the  
court would decide whether to grant Fox's appeal a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox sued in June, claiming that the new network violates a  
12-year non-compete agreement that was part of a $65 million deal 
the companies struck in 1996.

<HEADLINE> GOP Bill Would Extend Tax Credits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican bill to renew expiring tax  
credits and protect millions of middle-class taxpayers from what 
the GOP called a tax ``time bomb'' began moving Friday in the 
House. It drew a fresh veto threat from the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The individual items in the five-year, $23.3 billion package  
have strong bipartisan support, but Treasury Secretary Lawrence 
Summers told Democrats privately he would recommend a veto because 
the measure would consume part of the projected budget surplus 
before other priorities are met. 
</P>
<P>
	That infuriated House Republicans, who accused President Clinton  
and Democrats of using the ``extenders'' package as a bargaining 
chip in larger spending and tax battles. The president vetoed the 
GOP's centerpiece 10-year, $792 billion tax cut a day earlier, but 
said he might sign a smaller package. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm terribly confused,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas,  
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. ``It is becoming 
painfully clear that the only specific priority for the president 
this fall is higher and higher Washington spending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the top Democrat on the panel, Rep. Charles Rangel of New  
York, said the president was rightly holding the line on spending 
the budget surplus until the future solvency of Social Security and 
Medicare is ensured and the elderly gain a new prescription drug 
benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill is not paid for,'' Rangel said. ``These are very,  
very popular items, but they don't want to work it out with the 
president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Ways and Means Committee approved the extenders package on a  
strict party-line vote after defeating a Democratic alternative 
that would have paid the costs by closing several corporate tax 
shelters. The bill next moves to the full House. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally part of the larger tax cut, the package includes a  
five-year extension of the research and development tax credit 
popular with high-tech industry and manufacturers. In addition, it 
would permanently ensure that middle-class taxpayers who claim 
credits such as the $500-per-child credit do not become entangled 
in the complex, costly alternative minimum tax, or AMT. 
</P>
<P>
	Archer estimated that unless the AMT fix is approved, 1 million  
taxpayers could be faced with higher income taxes -- ``the tax-hike 
time bomb,'' he said -- if they claim too many credits. The AMT was 
originally intended to prevent the wealthy from escaping taxes 
through legal credits and deductions, but it is not indexed for 
inflation and has been affecting more and more people with modest 
incomes. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also renews credits encouraging businesses to hire  
former welfare recipients and people from groups who traditionally 
have trouble keeping jobs. It extends an oil and gas provision and 
one exempting from taxes certain foreign corporate income from 
banking, insurance or financing business. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the bill would be paid for using projected budget  
surpluses, but its $1.5 billion cost in fiscal 2000 would be offset 
by raising taxes on high-income individuals for that year only. 
Also to save money, companies would be temporarily ``suspended'' 
from taking the R&AMP;D credit until Oct. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The veto rhetoric aside, the sheer popularity of the extenders  
and the need to get them done quickly -- the Internal Revenue 
Service says it needs guidance by Oct. 7 to do the proper AMT forms 
-- means they will likely win final approval one way or another. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the package is one more piece of leverage the White  
House can use to push through at least its Medicare reform and 
prescription drug benefit, if not a Social Security fix. 
</P>
<P>
	Toward that end, Summers and White House Chief of Staff John  
Podesta met Friday with Senate Finance Committee Chairman William 
Roth, R-Del., to begin exploring common ground on these issues as 
well as tax relief. Roth has said he will work this fall on a 
Medicare reform bill, including prescription drugs.

<HEADLINE> Hakkinen Blazes Practice in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NUERBURGRING, Germany (AP) -- Mika Hakkinen, the defending  
Formula One champion, drove his McLaren-Mercedes to the fastest 
time in Friday's free practice for the European Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far everything has gone well and we will continue to focus  
on improving the car over the weekend,'' said Hakkinen, who hopes 
to bounce back from his major disappointment two weeks ago in the 
Italian Grand Prix at Monza. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen was comfortably in the lead when he made a mistake and  
spun out of the race. He then broke down in tears. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of strengthening his lead in the drivers' standings,  
Hakkinen dropped into a tie for first place with Eddie Irvine, who 
is seeking to become the first Ferrari driver to win the title in 
20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen and Irvine are tied at 60 points, with three races left  
in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	A victory Sunday, worth 10 points, would give either driver a  
significant lead before the championship is decided in the final 
two races -- in Malaysia Oct. 17 and Japan Oct. 31. Second place 
brings only six points. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen dominated Friday's two practice sessions and will be  
favorite to win his 12th pole position of the season in Saturday's 
qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an interesting track for a driver as you carry a lot  
of speed into the corners, but this also means that you have to 
work hard to get the balance right,'' said Hakkinen, whose team 
used only one set of tires. 
</P>
<P>
	A Ferrari was second, although it was not driven not by Irvine  
but his teammate Mika Salo, giving Finnish drivers the top two 
places in the practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen's best lap on the 2.831-mile Nuerburgring was one  
minute, 20.758 seconds. Salo was clocked in 1:20.920, just .162 
behind Hakkinen. 
</P>
<P>
	Free practice times may not mean much for the qualifying and the  
race itself since many teams use the two sessions to experiment 
with various setups. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the work we have done over the past few days has paid off  
and the car is much better, although not perfect,'' Irvine said. 
``The main effect of the changes is that we have more grip.''

<HEADLINE> Russia Awaits Oct. IMF Loan Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- The Russian government expects to receive the next  
$640 million installment of a $4.5 billion loan package from the 
International Monetary Fund in October, a top official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a possibility that a decision involving the tranche  
will be made by mid-October,'' First Deputy Prime Minister Viktor 
Khristenko said. That would mean the loan would be received at the 
end of that month. 
</P>
<P>
	Khristenko said an audit of the Russian central bank's  
transactions through offshore subsidiaries has not come up with 
evidence of wrongdoing by the bank or the government. The audit is 
expected to be completed soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reviews of all accounts have not brought up any claims,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF has come under fire after an alleged money-laundering  
scheme involving Russians and the Bank of New York. No one has been 
charged in the case, but the IMF is considering whether it should 
impose additional controls on the use of IMF funds in Russia.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Keep Falling; Dow Down 78.84 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell again today, extending Thursday's  
steep selloff fueled by concerns that technology stocks are 
overvalued. 
</P>
<P>
	In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was down 78.84 at 10,239.75, adding to its 205-point drop 
on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow has tumbled more than 600 points or more than 5 percent  
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also slumped today. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was down 15.10 at 1,265.31. The 
technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index was down 56.58 at 
2,693.25, adding to its 108-point decline on Thursday, its 
fourth-biggest drop ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors today continued to focus on comments made by Microsoft  
president Steve Ballmer, who said at a conference Thursday that 
technology stocks -- including Microsoft -- are too highly priced. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market was looking for a reason to sell off and he gave it  
a reason,'' said Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at 
George K. Baum &AMP; Co., in Kansas City, Mo. ``The market needs 
catalysts in terms of corrections and this was the catalyst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks also came under selling pressure amid concerns  
that the earthquake that hit Taiwan earlier this week will hurt 
production of computer chips and may force price increases. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan's semiconductor sector accounts for about 10 percent of  
the world's chipmaking capacity and about 80 percent of the 
``motherboards'' used to run personal computers, according to the 
Semiconductor Industry Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, which fell 4 7/8 on Thursday, was down 1 5/8 at 89 9/16 at  
midday and Intel was off 4 3/16 at 73 5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's losses came despite some positive economic news. The  
dollar rose slightly against the Japanese yen for the second 
straight day. The U.S. currency has been lingering near its lowest 
levels against the yen since 1996, and its weakness has been a big 
factor in the stock market's selloff this week. 
</P>
<P>
	A lower dollar makes imports more expensive, setting the stage  
for inflation, and it also makes foreign investments more 
attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	In early New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 104.15 yen,  
up from 103.95 late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the National Association of Realtors reported that  
sales of existing homes fell by bigger-than-expected 2.8 percent in 
August, the second straight month of declines after hitting a 
record high in June. The realtor group cited rising interest rates 
as the reason for the drop. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 411.63 million 
shares, up from 381.17 million shares early Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index was down 5.63 at 414.58.

<HEADLINE> GOP Senators Form Waco Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Democrats are refusing to participate  
in a Republican-led task force that will investigate how President 
Clinton's Justice Department handled inquiries into the Waco 
standoff, alleged campaign finance abuses and nuclear espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	A key Democratic lawmaker scoffed at the Republican's offer to  
make the probe bipartisan, saying the task force had been set up 
over Democratic objections and had been announced to reporters 
first. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a Republican task force. No Democrats have been  
involved,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the senior Democrat 
on the Senate Judiciary Committee. ``I don't intend to be part of a 
Republican-organized, partisan investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At an earlier news conference, Senate Majority Leader Trent  
Lott, R-Miss., said the task force would be chaired by Sen. Arlen 
Specter, R-Pa., and would focus on ``what in the world is happening 
at the Justice Department, why is there no justice at the Justice 
Department?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said the five-member task force would include two Democrats  
and two more Republicans in addition to Specter. But only one other 
Republican member, Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, was present at 
Thursday's announcement. No Democrats attended. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans had squabbled among themselves for weeks over the  
size and scope of the probe. But even as they debated, Specter was 
moving forward. He said his aides had traveled to Texas to preserve 
evidence collected from the FBI's 1993 siege against members of the 
Branch Davidian cult. The 51-day siege ended when the cult's 
compound near Waco erupted in flames. Davidian leader David Koresh 
and some 80 followers died during the inferno, some from fire, 
others from gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter said his aides found only one of two canisters that  
federal agents only recently admitted firing. ``Nobody knows'' what 
happened to the other one, Specter said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also confirmed he had talked with Charles LaBella about  
leading the panel's investigation. LaBella is a former Justice 
Department prosecutor who publicly disagreed with Attorney General 
Janet Reno's decision not to have an outside, independent counsel 
investigate alleged fund-raising abuses by the Clinton-Gore 
campaign in the 1996 election. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a great, great many questions which are left  
unanswered,'' Specter said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things just aren't right,'' agreed Grassley.  
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina will round out the  
Republican side of the panel, Specter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter said that at the request of former Sen. John Danforth he  
will hold off for 30 days before talking to witnesses to the 
government siege. Reno named Danforth to head an independent 
investigation of the government's use of force against the 
Davidians. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the Judiciary Committee last week, Danforth  
complained that Specter's investigators already had interviewed 
witnesses. ``In the interest of avoiding even the appearance of a 
turf battle,'' Specter told reporters Thursday, he agreed to hold 
off on interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	The probes were sparked by public disclosures last month that  
the FBI used the potentially incendiary tear gas on the final day 
of the siege. Although Republicans had accused the FBI of covering 
up use of such devices for years, the Justice Department, in fact, 
had informed Congress in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials maintain that Branch Davidians, and not  
federal agents, set the fatal fire on April 19, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the Senate Judiciary Committee  
chairman, had wanted a narrowly focused probe; Specter and Lott 
advocated a broader look at the Justice Department. Hatch did not 
attend Thursday's news conference on the issue, and later told 
reporters he grudgingly signed off on Specter's plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have preferred it be done another way,'' Hatch said.  
``It's out of my hands now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Specter was ready to start putting a staff in place. LaBella, he  
said, ``would hit the ground with a sprint.'' But he added that he 
will not extend a formal offer to LaBella until after he has spoken 
with Democrats over the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerned that LaBella's stewardship of an investigation that  
would focus largely on his former boss' performance, Specter said 
he has received informal approval for the hiring from officials on 
the Senate Ethics Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	LaBella would have intimate knowledge of the campaign finance  
investigation, but Specter said the task force probe would stretch 
to a third topic, the Justice Department's handling of alleged 
nuclear espionage by China. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI has expanded its China spying probe following criticism  
that for more than three years it focused too narrowly on the Los 
Alamos nuclear weapons lab in New Mexico.

<HEADLINE>  London Stages Fashion Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Shrugging off the absence of several of its stars,  
London Fashion Week again proved it deserves its reputation for 
exciting, cutting-edge design. 
</P>
<P>
	From Hussein Chalayan's remote-controlled glass-fiber dress over  
a fluffy pink tutu, to Amanda Wakeley's sleekly classic evening 
sheaths, London has not lost its wow factor -- or its claim to be a 
fashion capital. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, it's been what people love London about: very  
extreme, very bold, very exciting,'' said designer Paul Costelloe, 
who opened proceedings Monday night with a collection of long 
tunics and fluid trousers in the brightest pinks. 
</P>
<P>
	While fashion ``may grow up elsewhere,'' said Daily Telegraph  
fashion editor Hilary Alexander, ``London is where you see fashion 
being born.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 40 designers held catwalk shows over four days and  
more than 200 others exhibited accessories and jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
	The look for spring/summer 2000 is ruched, ruffled and ridged,  
in layers of buttery leather, delicate lace or wisps of chiffon 
printed with florals, spots and stripes or scattered with sequins. 
The palette is white, moss, flesh tones and pastels. Look for 
blouson tops, the tiniest hot pants and daring backless dresses 
with this season's new neckline, the halter. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander McQueen, Vivienne Westwood and Nicole Farhi opted out  
of the London scene after unveiling their collections in New York 
last week. And once again, Antonio Berardi will stage his show in 
Milan. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chalayan, the British Designer of the Year, was there with  
an array of his trademark precision-cut garments. 
</P>
<P>
	In keeping with the season's very feminine look, he showed  
concertina frills and fluted hems on tutus and ballerina dresses. 
Some had cutaway backs with intricately scrolled petticoats that 
resembled rosebuds. 
</P>
<P>
	A child used a remote control device to open the glass-fiber  
panels of one dress, revealing a confection of tulle petticoats. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Smith produced trouser suits and shirts in candy stripes  
that evoked gracious 1920s tennis parties, and embroidered velvets 
inspired by India. Owen Gaster shone with skirts in skin-tight 
snakeskin, tailored pink tweed and leather printed with holograms. 
</P>
<P>
	Red or Dead's Wayne Hemingway sent ``real people'' down the  
catwalk in African prints and outfits in batik, cheesecloth and 
crushed linen, hessian, muslin and leather. He said he decided not 
to use models to give ``a sense of an egalitarian future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Welsh designer Julien Macdonald, known for his glorious knits,  
injected a note of glamour by having Mel G -- Scary Spice to her 
fans -- model a translucent pink beaded dress with slim jeweled 
straps. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Macdonald creations included vivid PVC bomber jackets  
printed with computer graphics, tie-dye jackets and fluorescent 
miniskirts and mirrored halter dresses. 
</P>
<P>
	Another up-and-coming designer, Matthew Williamson, produced  
sequin-studded camisoles and low-slung ``harem'' skirts studded 
with jewels, inspired by India's exotic Kathkali dancers. 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, most shows were held in marquees erected at the main  
venue, the Natural History Museum. But this year many designers 
opted for the battered warehouses that line Brick Lane in east 
London, the historical home of Britain's garment industry. 
</P>
<P>
	They included Preen, which showed dramatically draped leather  
tunics with halter tops and torn hems and Clements Ribeiro, who 
produced dresses, blouson tops, skirts and micro shorts in 
transparent chiffon scattered with flowers or sequins in pink, 
plum, brown and yellow. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonja Nuttall displayed her pleated and ruched outfits in stone,  
black and honey on racks in the back of a parked truck. 
</P>
<P>
	The $28 billion a year British fashion industry now employs  
300,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Strikes Back at GOP Rivals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pat Buchanan accused Republican presidential  
rivals on Friday of `piling on me'' in their criticism of his views 
about Nazi Germany, as he prepared to consult with Reform Party 
founder Ross Perot about possibly leaving the GOP for a third-party 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican and conservative leaders, including at least three  
fellow presidential candidates, have issued harsh judgments of 
Buchanan's campaign book, ``A Republican, Not an Empire.'' The book 
questioned the timing of United States' entry into World War II and 
its participation in the battle against Adolf Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
	In a detailed statement, Buchanan argued that ``liberal  
interventionism,'' not isolationism, spawned Hitler's fascism. 
``While the West is busy erecting Holocaust museums, it has failed 
to study the history that produced it,'' Buchanan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, the United States is handing out war guarantees all  
over Eastern Europe, guarantees a future generation of Americans 
may refuse to honor, guarantees that are driving a defeated, 
demoralized, divided and democratic Russia, with 20,000 nuclear 
weapons, straight into the arms of a Chinese Communist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the book was written to prevent ``that cataclysm.''  
</P>
<P>
	``As for my Republican rivals, opportunistically piling on me,  
to the giddy applause of the establishment, do you really think you 
will be spared should you also violate the normal of political 
correctness and speak the truth to power?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential rivals John McCain, Elizabeth Dole and Steve Forbes  
have questioned Buchanan's writings in highly critical terms. 
McCain said Republicans should welcome Buchanan's departure from 
the party. 
</P>
<P>
	Front-runner George W. Bush said in an interview Friday that he  
wants Buchanan to remain Republican, though he disagreed with his 
opinion that Germany was not a threat to the United States after 
1940. ``Germany (was) a threat,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, meanwhile, was planning to hold a long-expected  
conversation with Perot by telephone in the next few days, 
according to officials close to both men. 
</P>
<P>
	For Buchanan, the call is a matter of courtesy extended to the  
party's founder. He also may get a sense of Perot's feelings about 
his potential candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Reform Party is the house that Ross built,'' Buchanan  
said, ``and I've got a great respect for Mr. Perot and what he went 
through to build that party and to challenge the two incumbent 
parties, and I would certainly want to speak with him about what 
his intentions were and what he believed is best for that party 
because I think he'd have great influence upon what could happen 
and would happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what he would like most about the prospect of being the  
Reform nominee, he talked about his place in the presidential 
debates next fall ``standing up on a platform with W. and Al Gore 
for 90 minutes three times in October in the year 2000 because I 
think the debates would probably then decide the election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan has no assurances from Perot or knowledgeable  
associates that the party founder will endorse him, officials in 
both camps said Friday. Nor does Buchanan know whether Perot would 
agree to not block a Buchanan bid, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	They spoke on condition of anonymity, and have cautioned for  
days that Perot has not tipped his hand. However, Buchanan's team 
has been given strong encouragement by Perot supporters, such as 
his former running mate, Pat Choate. 
</P>
<P>
	One senior Perot adviser said it is conceivable that the party  
founder could enter the race himself if an economic crisis or other 
tragedy triggered a groundswell of calls for his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Perot has said little about his plans for 2000.  
</P>
<P>
	``The deafening silence says that he will abide by the  
collective will of the party and not stand in the way of Buchanan 
or (Donald) Trump or George W. Bush, should he decide to leave that 
failed (Republican) Party,'' outgoing Reform Party chairman Russell 
Verney said, denying that Perot is implicitly backing Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	In another sign that Buchanan is on the brink of bolting, the  
New Hampshire Reform Party postponed its convention this week after 
Buchanan advisers tried to gain control of the party. 
</P>
<P>
	Others mentioned as potential Reform Party presidential nominees  
are real estate tycoon Trump of New York and Minnesota Gov. Jesse 
Ventura, highest-elected official in the party.

<HEADLINE> `Third Man' Tops 100 British Films </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- ``The Third Man,'' a classic tale of intrigue set  
in post-World War II Vienna, has been named the best British film 
of the century in a poll announced this week by the British Film 
Industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Other films to make the top 10 ranged from Alfred Hitchcock's  
``The 39 Steps,'' at No. 4, to Nicholas Roeg's erotic chiller 
``Don't Look Now,'' at No. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	David Lean was responsible for three top citations, with ``Brief  
Encounter,'' ``Lawrence of Arabia'' and ``Great Expectations'' -- 
placing second, third and fifth, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Alec Guinness starred in more listed films than anyone else,  
with nine, while Michael Caine headlined in seven and Julie 
Christie starred in six. 
</P>
<P>
	The list was chosen by 1,000 people in the British film and  
television industries, who collectively cast 25,700 votes covering 
820 films. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Third Man,'' directed by Carol Reed, is a stylish 1949  
adaptation of a Graham Greene thriller. Filmed against a backdrop 
of ruined buildings and starring Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten, it 
contains some of cinema's most memorable black-and-white images. 
The background theme of zither music is so powerfully connected to 
the story that it is instantly recognized by anyone who has seen 
the film. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the results, the '60s were the evident golden age for  
British movies. Twenty-six films from that decade made the list, as 
opposed to 17 from the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one recent film made the top 10 -- ``Trainspotting,''  
director Danny Boyle's scabrous 1996 look at heroin addicts in 
Scotland. It is also movie that launched Ewan McGregor as an 
international name. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oscar-winning ``Shakespeare In Love,'' Shekhar Kapur's  
``Elizabeth'' and Ken Loach's ``My Name Is Joe'' were three other 
films from last year to make the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the choices may surprise Americans, since they  
include such films as ``The English Patient,'' ``Sense and 
Sensibility,'' and ``Shakespeare In Love,'' all of which were made 
either largely or wholly with American money. 
</P>
<P>
	But for the purposes of the poll, the industry qualified as a  
British film any movie employing a substantial number of Britons. 
All three of the movies named above used British talent who went on 
to win Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	While most of the films draw on original scripts, many are  
adaptations of novels and plays, reflecting Britain's rich literary 
heritage. Shakespeare, Dickens, Alan Bennett, and Graham Greene 
were among the authorial heavyweights to have made the list.

<HEADLINE> Report: Crew Chief Leaving Gordon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOVER, Del. (AP) -- Jeff Gordon is losing the only crew chief he  
has had in his Winston Cup career. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN-SI reported Friday that Ray Evernham is quitting after  
helping Gordon win three championships in the last four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The network, citing no sources, said Evernham will act as  
Gordon's crew chief for this weekend's MNBA Gold 400, but mechanic 
Brian Whitesell will make the race-day calls. Whitesell will 
replace Evernham when he leaves, perhaps before the end of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Evernham and John Hendrick, head of Hendrick Motorsports, had no  
comment when asked about the report Friday at Dover Downs 
International Speedway. The company plans an announcement next 
month concerning Gordon's team. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon was unable to shed much light on the report.  
</P>
<P>
	``The plan all along has been to take our guys and step them up  
in our program,'' he said. ``That's been Ray's wishes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked like things were going to be taking place anyway,  
and we are basically stepping into a little of that right now. 
We're still trying to figure out how everything is going to shake 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evernham has helped Gordon win 47 Winston Cup races. For months,  
there have been reports of friction between Evernham and the 
Hendrick organization. His contract runs through the 2006 season, 
but CNN-SI said a release is being negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of Evernham's departure has caused speculation that  
he will start his own Winston Cup team. This season, he and Gordon 
started a Busch Grand National team under the banner of 
Gordon-Evernham Motorsports. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN-SI said Gordon is expected to sign a long-term contract with  
Hendrick, which would include partial ownership of all three 
Hendrick teams.

<HEADLINE> House Panel Starts Hilliard Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Earl Hilliard is promising full  
cooperation with a House ethics committee investigation into 
allegations arising from his personal and political financial 
activities since his election to Congress in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee announced Thursday that it wants to find out if  
the Alabama Democrat violated House rules or federal laws in three 
specific areas: 
</P>
<P>
	--Loans his campaign committee made to specific individuals in  
1993 and 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Birmingham office space his campaign occupied from 1992  
through 1998, including expenditures for rent and utilities. 
</P>
<P>
	--His compliance with federal financial disclosure laws from 1992  
to 1999 regarding his ownership interest in two companies, 
Hilliards &AMP; Co. Inc., and the Birmingham Greater Golf Associates 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will cooperate with the committee,'' Hilliard said. ``I've  
been through this before and I don't see any reason not to 
cooperate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hilliard said the investigation involves old issues that he  
thought had been resolved. He said he fully expected to be 
exonerated. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics committee asked Hilliard in January 1998 to respond  
to a list of questions about his personal and business dealings 
that were raised by a series of newspaper articles. Hilliard said 
he answered a second, detailed list of questions from the committee 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hill, a weekly newspaper that covers Congress, reported in  
late 1997 that Hilliard's campaign committee had paid more than 
$100,000 to companies and nonprofit organizations linked to the 
lawmaker in the six years since he first began campaigning for 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Election Commission records show that since 1992,  
Hilliard's campaign paid $67,100 in rent to various companies that 
share the same address as the congressman's campaign headquarters 
in Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
	During the same six-year period, the campaign also has made  
payments to companies or nonprofit organizations with links to 
Hilliard, totaling $16,800 for radio advertising fees, $5,973 for 
insurance premiums and $7,200 for donations. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal election law permits campaigns to use candidate-owned  
companies as long as they pay market rates for goods and services. 
The Hill said some of the payments by Hilliard's campaign suggest 
that they may have been converted to personal use or used for 
non-campaign purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee's questions about Hilliard's compliance with  
financial disclosure laws apparently stems from his failure to 
report his interest in Hilliards and Co. and in Birmingham Greater 
Golf Associates Inc. on the financial disclosure forms members of 
Congress must file each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilliard said he had filed amendments listing the two companies,  
even though he still contends he was not required to disclose them 
because neither had any assets or value. 
</P>
<P>
	On the loan question, Hilliard said his campaign committee did  
make loans to several individuals who worked for the campaign, but 
he denied any wrongdoing. He said one loan was repaid and two 
others were not. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics committee named Rep. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, to head the  
investigation, and Rep. Martin Olav Sabo, D-Minn., to serve as 
ranking Democrat. Others named to the investigating panel were 
Reps. Kenny Hulshof, R-Mo., and Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Under committee rules, the panel will decide by majority vote  
whether to file formal charges against Hilliard. Any such charges 
then would be heard by a separate subcommittee. The full ethics 
committee eventually would have to approve any report to the House 
recommending action against Hilliard.

<HEADLINE> Worries About Vietnam Nagged LBJ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Exhausted from campaigning in 1964, President  
Johnson was so worried about the conflict in southeast Asia that 
there was no time for the Texan to bask in what would be the 
largest popular majority vote ever received by a president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish you'd go get some sun somewhere in Key West or  
something like that,'' Bill Moyers, a special assistant to Johnson 
told him on the phone before the returns were in on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson yawned loudly into the phone and replied that he  
couldn't -- something weighed on his mind: ``I'm afraid of 
Vietnam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The conversation was among the latest batch of Johnson  
recordings released today by the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library in 
Austin, Texas. The tapes are mostly from November and December 
1964, a year after Johnson ascended to the presidency when John F. 
Kennedy was assassinated. 
</P>
<P>
	The tapes capture Johnson's election night phone calls to and  
from supporters. His earthy and often blunt responses were tempered 
by his worries about America's involvement in the Vietnam conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in trouble in Vietnam, serious trouble,'' Johnson told  
Hubert H. Humphrey, his vice presidential running mate shortly 
before 6 p.m. on Election Day -- when they were still guessing how 
large their victory would be. 
</P>
<P>
	Often during the calls Johnson aired his worries over Vietnam  
and sought counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	In a conversation from his Texas ranch with Attorney General  
Robert F. Kennedy, Johnson kidded about how long it took Republican 
presidential candidate Barry Goldwater to concede the election. 
Kennedy said many people sympathized with Johnson about his having 
to wait for the concession speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, I'm going to need a hell of a lot of it, I'll tell you  
that,'' Johnson said. ``In the meantime, if you get any solution 
for Vietnam just call me direct, will you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy replied, ``I've got a thought about that.''  
</P>
<P>
	``I want to talk to you,'' said Johnson.  
</P>
<P>
	But the conversation was not without its jocular moment. Earlier  
Johnson and Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield, D-Mont., kidded 
Humphrey about donning Western clothes and riding a horse during 
his visit at the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
	``You look great in that Western outfit,'' says Mansfield to  
Humphrey, who was listening in on the line. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did you hear what Hubert announced in his speech here?'' says  
Johnson. ``By God, he said he'd resign if there was any more 
horseback riding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Humphrey joked that his Western clothes were ``droopy,'' and  
blamed it on Johnson: ``After all, the president was the man that 
dressed me.''

<HEADLINE> NBA To Crack Down on Physical Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Expect to hear a lot more  
whistles at the start of the NBA season under a crackdown on 
physical play that was outlined to the league's referees Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rules that were always on the books we are now going to  
enforce,'' NBA vice president of operations Rod Thorn said. ``In 
the exhibition season, there will be more fouls than normal, but 
once the season starts the players will adjust and adjust quickly. 
There are no good players who want to sit on the bench with three 
fouls after two minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four official rules changes are being adopted for the 1999-00  
season, but the crackdown on overly physical play is not among 
them. The league will simply instruct its referees to keep a 
vigilant eye out for clutching, grabbing and banging away from the 
ball, or players being hindered running around screens. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, what constitutes a foul in one ref's mind might not  
in another ref's mind, and Thorn acknowledged there will be a gray 
area regarding how much contact will be allowed away from the ball. 
But he said the league office will work with the referees in an 
effort to develop a standard that is consistent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect all our refs to know what to call and what not to  
call,'' Thorn said. ``We don't want a lot of ticky-tack fouls 
called.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting between the referees and the league's competition  
committee was one of several held among NBA personnel on a full day 
of activity in the league meetings, which are held every two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The day began with a general session, including a speech by  
commissioner David Stern, attended by team employees. 
</P>
<P>
	With trade talk at a relative lull -- although Scottie Pippen and  
Glen Rice rumors refused to die -- much of the focus was on the 
rules changes, be they official or unofficial. 
</P>
<P>
	Thorn, in a candid admission of what's ailing the game  
aesthetically, said the league wants to encourage fast breaks and a 
more wide-open style of play. The NBA is coming off the 
lowest-scoring season in its history, one in which just the 
Sacramento Kings averaged 100 points. The league-wide average of 91 
points a game was the lowest since the shot clock was introduced in 
1954-55. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of the 29 teams, 25 of the offenses are basically the same,''  
Thorn said, ``and I dare say that the majority of teams don't have 
a secondary fast break in their play book anymore. We're hoping 
this will get offenses to do some different things. We want to see 
some different looks and attacks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The officials rules changes are:  
</P>
<P>
	--A prohibition on forearm checking, except below the free-throw  
line. 
</P>
<P>
	--A 5-second rule limiting the amount of time an offensive player  
not facing the basket can control the ball below the free-throw 
line before he must pass, shoot or pick up his dribble. 
</P>
<P>
	--Resetting the shot clock to 14 seconds instead of 24 on certain  
stoppages of play. 
</P>
<P>
	--An exemption from illegal defense rules for players positioned  
on the strong side of the court. 
</P>
<P>
	The change in the illegal defense rule will amount to allowing a  
zone defense in the low post. Theoretically, it will encourage 
defenses to use double-teams to guard against entry passes into the 
low post, thereby deterring offenses from dumping the ball into the 
big man and then standing around waiting for him to either make a 
move or pass the ball out to the 3-point line. The result, 
hopefully, will be more cutting, passing and mid-range jump 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be harder to score in a set, half-court offense,  
so it'll be in teams' best interests to run, push the ball upcourt 
and shoot the ball early,'' Thorn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coaches and team executives said they will take a wait-and-see  
attitude toward the rules changes, which were first enforced during 
summer league games and resulted in a inordinate number of fouls. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're good recommendations, but we'll have to see  
how they are,'' Indiana president Donnie Walsh said. ``I think the 
league will be open to adjusting them to get the game back to where 
it was.''

<HEADLINE> Good Thing US Golfers Weren't Paid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- Maybe it's a good thing they didn't get  
paid. 
</P>
<P>
	Because imagine how many meals the so-called ``Brookline Four''  
-- David Duval, Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson and Mark O'Meara -- and 
their dependents would have missed if their livelihood actually 
depended on the results they produced in Friday's opening round of 
Ryder Cup matches. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning with the morning foursomes:  
</P>
<P>
	Duval and Mickelson lost 3 and 2 to Colin Montgomerie and Paul  
Lawrie. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods and Tom Lehman lost 2 and 1 to Sergio Garcia and Jesper  
Parnevik. 
</P>
<P>
	And continuing with the afternoon fourballs:  
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson and Jim Furyk lost 1-up to Parnevik and Garcia.  
</P>
<P>
	Duval and Woods lost 1-up to Lee Westwood and Darren Clarke.  
</P>
<P>
	Keeping in mind that U.S. captain Ben Crenshaw kept O'Meara  
lashed to the bench all day, that's zero points in four matches 
from the players who stood up at a team meeting last month and said 
they wanted a piece of the roughly $20 million profit the PGA of 
America will make on this singular event. 
</P>
<P>
	If only they wanted a piece of the Europeans that badly on  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The four also happen to be the world's No. 1 (Woods), No. 2  
(Duval), No. 11 (O'Meara) and No. 13 (Mickelson) ranked players. 
Small wonder the Europeans zoomed out to a 6-2 lead, and now might 
find overconfidence their toughest opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to deflate any and all such notions, European captain  
Mark James said, ``I'm sure Ben has a few trump cards up his 
sleeve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If so, it's hard to imagine what they might be.  
</P>
<P>
	The Europeans drilled the Americans in both the alternate-shot  
and best-ball format. They beat the two best U.S. players -- Woods 
and Duval -- playing their own balls. They found a new leader, Scot 
Colin Montgomerie, to take the place of departed veterans Seve 
Ballesteros and Nick Faldo. They got four of their seven rookies -- 
Spaniards Garcia and Miguel Angel Jimenez, Scot Paul Lawrie and 
Ireland's Padraig Harrington -- their baptism by fire without 
getting burned. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe that's why when James was asked to name best decision he  
made all day, he simply deadpanned, ``I had the hamburger for lunch 
-- instead of the chicken sandwich.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And you can be certain that even though James wouldn't admit as  
much, he's now looking forward to washing it down come Sunday with 
champagne sipped from that gold chalice donated 70 years ago by 
English seed merchant Sam Ryder. 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw, meanwhile, looked like he could use something stiffer  
than champagne by the end of the day. And he was probably reeling 
as early as the conclusion of the morning foursomes -- at least 
judging by his handwriting on the pairings sheet for the afternoon 
fourball matches. 
</P>
<P>
	On the left-hand side of the roster sheet, James had neatly  
printed the full name of each of his eight players. On the 
right-hand side were the American names in thick, wavering block 
letters, looking as though they'd been scrawled with a crayon by an 
unsteady hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's chaotic, confusing, excruciating,'' Crenshaw said about  
his job (though he could have said the same about his penmanship). 
</P>
<P>
	No doubt it's all those things -- and more. Crenshaw appeared so  
shell-shocked afterward that when he took his seat in the interview 
room, he asked out loud whether the score was actually 6-2. The 
scary thing is that his job only gets harder from here on out. 
</P>
<P>
	To be fair, there was nothing to suggest that the pay-for-play  
issue diverted anybody's attention from the task at hand. O'Meara 
was frustrated sitting out -- ``I'd be lying if I said I wasn't 
disappointed'' -- and the other members of the ``Brookline Four'' 
hardly covered themselves with glory, but not for a lack of effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods caught heat last month for saying he considered the Ryder  
Cup ``an exhibition'' because there was no winner's check at the 
end. And Duval, likewise, was roasted for comparing the matches to 
a ``large corporate outing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But anybody who saw Woods come racing out of the crowd to see  
his flop shot disappear into the hole on No. 10, or Duval fighting 
time and again to coax something better from his deteriorating game 
could be certain they were holding nothing back. 
</P>
<P>
	But the likelihood is that Crenshaw will go back to have dinner  
with his team Friday night and find that its psyche, fragmented 
even before the matches began, is now fragile as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best thing that I can possibly do is instill a belief in  
themselves,'' Cresnshaw said. ``I'm doing everything I can to do 
that and everybody else on the team is doing it as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``But,'' he said, finally, ``it's still a matter of seeing those  
results.''

<HEADLINE> Flooding Causing Hurricane Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The massive inland floods left behind by  
Hurricane Floyd are causing its biggest share of storm deaths, a 
change from times past when ocean surges along the coasts claimed 
the most lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the era of modern warnings and evacuations, the  
wind-driven waves known as storm surges were the greatest killers, 
killing thousands of people along coastlines. 
</P>
<P>
	But that has changed in recent years, hurricane forecaster Ed  
Rappaport reports in a study prepared for publication later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, with nearly 70 deaths, Floyd is the deadliest hurricane  
since Agnes, 27 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	And ``it will again be freshwater flooding that was the cause of  
the majority of the deaths,'' said Rappaport. 
</P>
<P>
	Of 415 drownings blamed on hurricanes since 1970, a total of  
292, or 71 percent, occurred in inland freshwater floods, he found. 
By contrast, 62 were shoreline drownings and just five were in the 
storm surges, massive walls of water driven ashore by hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a far cry from decades earlier when powerful storms often  
caused hundreds of deaths with storm surges. Indeed, the greatest 
natural disaster in U.S. history took place 99 years ago when a 
hurricane storm surge swept over Galveston, Texas, claiming an 
estimated 8,000 lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that the greatest potential for a loss of large  
magnitude is still the coast,'' Rappaport said, attributing the 
decline in storm surge deaths to improved forecasts and storm 
warnings and the willingness of people to move away from the coast 
when threatened. 
</P>
<P>
	And there has been some luck along the way too. For example,  
last year's Hurricane Georges was forecast to cross the Florida 
Keys as a category 3 storm, but weakened to a category 2. If it had 
strengthened instead, there could have been many fatalities, 
Rappaport said. 
</P>
<P>
	While people are increasingly aware of the storm surge danger at  
the coast, they know less of the hazard of inland flooding, he 
said, often waiting too long to react and then driving into danger. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least 20 percent of the (drownings) were people who were  
in, or attempting to abandon, their vehicles. Almost all of these 
were on, or near, freshwater-flooded roads,'' Rappaport noted. 
</P>
<P>
	In his paper, Rappaport estimated that hurricanes have killed a  
total of about 25,000 people in the United States since the 
American Revolution, mostly in storm surges. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the period from 1970 to 1998, inland flooding was the  
greatest hazard, he found. During that period, he found 517 deaths 
directly attributable to 59 different tropical storms and 
hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 517 fatalities, 295 died in inland counties, 128 in  
coastal counties, 55 offshore and 39 in locations that could not be 
determined. Besides those who drowned, others died of wind-related 
injuries, were killed by tornadoes associated with the hurricanes 
or from building failures, lightning, hypothermia or in downed 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	``Large losses occurred in several tropical cyclones, with more  
than 100 fatalities in Agnes, mostly due to inland flooding in the 
Northeastern states. In numerous instances, loss of life was large 
even after the storm had little or no remaining surface 
circulation,'' he reported, including Charley in 1998, 13 deaths; 
Alberto in 1994, 34 deaths, and Amelia in 1978, 33 deaths. ``For 
these systems, like Agnes, inland flooding from rain was the 
culprit,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Mercedes CEO Moves to AutoNation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The president and chief executive of luxury car  
maker Mercedes-Benz USA Inc. has been named as chief executive of 
the nation's biggest auto retailer, AutoNation Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael J. Jackson was named today to replace Steven Berrard,  
who left earlier this year after serving as right-hand man to 
AutoNation chairman H. Wayne Huizenga. Five other executives have 
also left this year at AutoNation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike Jackson is a car guy's car guy,'' Huizenga said in a  
statement on Jackson's appointment. ``He understands what it takes 
to be a successful automotive retailer because he's done it 
himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, 50, who began his automotive career 28 years ago as a  
Mercedes-Benz technician and led the car company to record U.S. 
sales, will be responsible for the development of AutoNation's 
business strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe in the AutoNation business model,'' said Jackson,  
who was in discussions with Huizenga for two months. ``I have 
admired from a distance how much AutoNation has achieved in such a 
relatively short period of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AutoNation has 412 franchises, 42 used car outlets and 270  
retail Web sites, but is in the midst of transition in its core 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	The company announced plans last month to sell its lackluster  
rental-car business, including the Alamo and National chains. 
</P>
<P>
	AutoNation spent about $1.8 billion over the past two years to  
acquire five rental car companies. But analysts say the businesses 
suffered from too many cars, reservation system problems and 
in-house discounting. 
</P>
<P>
	Others who have left AutoNation recently include president John  
Costello, who came from Sears, Roebuck less than a year before; 
rental car division chief Bill Lobeck; brand development chief Bob 
Thomas; senior vice president for human resources Bob Dees and vice 
president of investor relations Sheila Steuwe. 
</P>
<P>
	AutoNation's stock lost nearly a third of its value this summer  
and is off nearly three-quarters from a peak in January 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in his career, Jackson was managing partner of Euro  
Motorcars of Bethesda, Md., a regional auto dealership with 11 
franchises when he left.

<HEADLINE> Baca Still Victorious Over Brown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) -- Final results of a special  
election have confirmed that state Sen. Joe Baca did edge out the 
widow of Rep. George E. Brown Jr. to advance to a runoff election 
that will determine who will win Brown's seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Results released Friday by the San Bernardino County Registrar  
of Voters showed Baca getting 31.5 percent of the primary vote, and 
Marta Macias Brown coming up short with only 30.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the nine candidates in Tuesday's race received more than  
50 percent of the vote. The results mean that Baca, who received 
the greatest percentage of any Democrat, will now go on to run in a 
general election Nov. 16 against three other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Brown issued a written statement Friday after refusing to  
concede Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	She didn't outright endorse Baca, but said she looked forward to  
November and ``can see Democratic forces unifying to hold this 
seat, and I support that effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Brown's husband died July 15 at age 79. He was the  
longest-serving congressman in California history, holding the seat 
since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, Baca will face Republican Party candidate Elia  
Pirozzi, Reform Party candidate Rick Simon and Libertarian Party 
candidate John Ballard.

<HEADLINE> GOP Prepares Bare-Bones Tax Measure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Opening a new front in the tax battle, House  
Republicans today began moving a $23.2 billion, five-year measure 
to renew a handful of expiring tax credits that immediately drew a 
fresh veto threat from the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after President Clinton vetoed the GOP's 10-year, $792  
billion tax cut, the House Ways and Means Committee approved the 
``extenders'' measure on a strict party-line vote, clearing it for 
floor action. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally part of the larger bill, the new bill includes a  
five-year extension of the research and development tax credit 
popular with high-tech industry and manufacturers. It would 
permanently ensure that middle-class taxpayers who claim credits 
such as the $500-per-child credit do not become entangled in the 
complex, costly alternative minimum tax. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ways and Means Committee chairman, Rep. Bill Archer,  
R-Texas, said the panel was acting with dispatch because the 
Internal Revenue Service needs guidance by Oct. 7 to draft the 
proper tax forms for filing season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless tax law changes were made by Oct. 7, they would have  
real problems holding down costs and making next year's tax filing 
season run smoothly,'' Archer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the items in the package have bipartisan support, a  
Treasury Department official said Clinton would likely veto it 
because it would spend part of the projected budget surplus over 
five years before agreement is reached on the future solvency of 
Social Security and Medicare. Clinton gave those same reasons for 
his veto of the larger GOP tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	The new bill ``does not follow the framework set out by the  
president,'' said Jon Talisman, a top Treasury tax official. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also faces an uncertain future in the Senate, where  
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said its success requires that 
members of Congress -- particularly in the Senate -- have the 
discipline not to use it as a vehicle to load up other pet tax 
items. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd have to have a lot of cooperation,'' Lott said. ``It  
tends to be the engine that pulls a lot of cars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a Rose Garden ceremony Thursday, Clinton followed through on  
his repeated promise to veto the larger $792 billion, 10-year GOP 
tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``At a time when America is moving in the right direction, this  
bill would turn us back to the failed policies of the past,'' the 
president said. 
</P>
<P>
	That bill would have reduced all income tax rates by 1  
percentage point, eased the marriage penalty on many two-income 
couples, eliminate estate taxes and the alternative minimum income 
tax, reduce capital gains taxes, expand pension and 401(k) laws and 
provide numerous business tax breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the GOP measure would undermine efforts to shore up  
the Social Security and Medicare programs, to reduce the national 
debt and to improve education. ``The bill is too big, too bloated, 
places too great a burden on America's economy,'' the president 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would force drastic cuts in education, health care and  
other vital areas,'' Clinton added. ``It would cripple our ability 
to pay down the debt. It would not add a day to the Social Security 
trust fund, it would not add a day to the Medicare trust fund or 
modernize Medicare with prescription drug coverage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans disputed the president and said he had killed tax  
relief for families, for education and for low-income Americans. 
``I regret the president has stolen this tax cut from working 
American families,'' Lott said in a remark echoed by GOP 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders said they would now concentrate on fixing Social  
Security, preventing $248 billion in tax increases urged by the 
administration over 10 years, restraining the growth of government 
and reducing the debt.

<HEADLINE>  Stocks Dip; Dow Ends Off 39.26 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rounded out a dismal week with a volatile  
session but generally modest losses Friday. Investors continued 
selling semiconductor stocks, but made some cautious overtures 
toward battered shares of Internet and financial companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 39.26 to close at  
10,279.33. The Dow finished the week 524.30 points below last 
Friday's close, a loss of 4.9 percent. It was the first time the 
Dow has ever lost more than 500 points in a single week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow has now dropped 1,046.71, or 9.2 percent, below its  
record close of 11,326.04, set Aug. 25. But it is still up nearly 
12 percent for all of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also ended lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 fell 3.05 to 1,277.36, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 9.42 
to 2,740.41. 
</P>
<P>
	With little news to move the market, investors fell prey to the  
momentum that dragged the Dow below 10,500 on Thursday. Analysts 
consider 10,500 a ``technical support'' level, and most have long 
forecast that a drop below that level would prompt further selling 
as investors fear the market is approaching a major, enduring 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will take days, or maybe weeks, before the market  
stabilizes,'' said Tom Galvin, chief equity strategist at 
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday, investors remained focused on fears that technology  
stocks, the market's strongest performers for most of 1999, are 
faltering. 
</P>
<P>
	The market continued to suffer from Microsoft president Steve  
Ballmer's remarks Thursday that technology stocks -- including 
Microsoft -- are too highly priced. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market was looking for a reason to sell off and he gave it  
a reason,'' said Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at 
George K. Baum &AMP; Co., in Kansas City, Mo. ``The market needs 
catalysts in terms of corrections and this was the catalyst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks also came under selling pressure amid concerns  
that the earthquake that hit Taiwan earlier this week will hurt 
production of computer chips and may force price increases. Taiwan 
is a major semiconductor producer. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft slipped 1/4 to 90 15/16, and Intel fell 1 53/64 to 75  
43/64. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyclical companies, whose fortunes tend to mirror the strength  
of the overall economy, sustained some heavy losses. Minnesota 
Mining &AMP; Manufacturing dropped 3 7/16 to 91 13/16, the worst 
performer in the Dow. 
</P>
<P>
	By early afternoon, some buyers were treading cautiously back  
into the market. America Online rose 10 to 97 1/2, a gain analysts 
attributed to Microsoft's decision to raise Internet access fees. 
That could prevent AOL from succumbing to price competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial companies had some strength, with American Express  
rising 1 to 136 3/8 and Bank of America gaining 3 1/16 to 57 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's losses came despite some positive economic news. The  
dollar rose slightly against the Japanese yen for the second 
straight day, edging up to 104.15 yen from 103.95 late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. currency has been lingering near its lowest levels  
against the yen since 1996, and its weakness has been a big factor 
in the stock market's selloff this week. A lower dollar makes 
imports more expensive and it also makes foreign investments more 
attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the National Association of Realtors reported sales  
of existing homes fell by a bigger-than-expected 2.8 percent in 
August, the second straight decline after hitting a record high in 
June. The realtor group cited rising interest rates as the reason 
for the drop. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest rates remain a powerful force in the market as the  
Federal Reserve's Oct. 5 meeting draws near. Many analysts expect 
the Fed to raise rates for the third time this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether the central bank raises rates or holds them steady, the  
decision could lead to a market recovery, Galvin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market will grind along the bottom until then,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. Composite volume totaled 1.04 billion 
shares, compared with 1.06 billion the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 3.12 to 417.09.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas indexes plunged, following Thursday's weak showing on  
Wall Street. Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 2.62 percent. In 
Europe, Germany's DAX index lost 2.1 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 
fell 0.5 percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 1.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Move Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean prices settled mostly higher  
Friday in mixed trading ahead of a big harvest weekend. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat led the gains, responding to rumors that Egypt would  
be purchasing wheat. Prices also was buoyed by heavy Iranian wheat 
imports and by Indonesia's rejection of an Australian wheat deal. 
</P>
<P>
        Corn and soybeans rose on false rumors, traders said, of a  
change in the U.S. Department of Agriculture's loan policy which could 
limit the amount of crops on the market. 
</P>
<P>
        But gains were limited by forecasts predicting weekend weather  
beneficial to harvests throughout the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat for December delivery rose 4 1/2 cents to $2.77 3/4 a  
bushel; December corn rose 1/2 cent to $2.08 3/4 a bushel; December 
oats were unchanged at $1.13 1/4 a bushel; November soybeans rose 2 
cents to $4.80 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
        Beef and pork futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  
</P>
<P>
        October live cattle rose .60 cent to 66.97 cents a pound; October  
feeder cattle rose .62 cent to 80.02 cents a pound; October lean hogs 
rose .40 cent to 46.50 cents a pound; February frozen pork bellies 
rose 3 cents to 62.42 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Boosts Funds for Adoption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Surrounded by adopted children and their  
smiling parents on Friday, President Clinton pointed to nationwide 
success moving foster children to permanent homes, and announced 
more than $25 million in federal money for adoption programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration will award $20 million in bonuses to  
35 states where adoptions are on the increase. The largest bonus 
will go to Illinois, which gets $6.8 million as a reward for 
increasing adoptions to 4,656 last year -- more than double the 
average number of adoptions in the previous two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Another $5.5 million will go to promote adoptions across state  
lines and adoptions of children with special needs or problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The money follows on a 1997 law that relaxed or eliminated laws  
limiting adoptions of foster children. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have new evidence that these efforts are bearing fruit,''  
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited a new Health and Human Services Department report  
showing adoptions from the foster care system increased from 28,000 
in 1996 to 36,000 in 1998. Clinton called it the first significant 
increase in adoptions since the national foster care program was 
created nearly 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration set a goal of doubling annual adoptions  
nationwide by 2002, which would mean about 56,000 in that year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're well on our way,'' Clinton said at a ceremony also  
attended by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and several families 
with adopted children. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said most credit should go to families such as Dawn and  
Steven Keane of Hershey, Pa., who open their homes to foster 
children or others who might never find a permanent home otherwise. 
The Keanes' three children introduced Clinton at Friday's event. 
Two of the children were adopted last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are the proof of the unlimited goodness of the human  
heart,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Social services agencies say it is very hard to find permanent  
families for older children who may have bounced from foster home 
to foster home. Similarly, children with medical or behavioral 
problems are difficult to place. 
</P>
<P>
	The audience also included what Clinton called a remarkable  
bipartisan congressional delegation. The group of six included two 
of the most visible political personalities of last year's 
impeachment drama -- House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, who 
called the evidence against Clinton overwhelming, and Rep. Maxine 
Waters, D-Calif., one of the president's loudest defenders. 
</P>
<P>
	``This may be the only issue all six of these people agree on,''  
Clinton said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
	Continuing in a folksy tone, Clinton said he got quite angry  
recently as he read a newspaper profile about DeLay. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got about halfway through and he was giving me the devil for  
something. You know he's very good at that,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he was particularly irritated at DeLay's  
insinuation that the president cheats at golf. His irritation 
evaporated, Clinton said, as the story turned to DeLay's experience 
as a foster parent. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden I didn't care what he said about my golf  
game,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Clinton framed adoption as a nonpartisan issue, at  
least one House Republican claimed that the White House glossed 
over one political point. The GOP-passed $792 billion tax cut that 
Clinton vetoed Thursday would have doubled the tax credit available 
to adoptive families. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the president was truly concerned about the adoptions of  
foster children in America, he would have signed the tax relief 
package Congress sent him,'' said Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla. and 
chairman of the House Republican Conference.

<HEADLINE> IOC Official Criticizes US Drug Czar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A senior Olympic executive delivered a blunt  
message to the White House drug adviser: Crack down on drugs in pro 
sports in the United States instead of criticizing the 
International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the greatest of respect, your view is clearly wrong,''  
IOC vice president Dick Pound said in a letter to Barry McCaffrey, 
director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said he was troubled by McCaffrey's attacks on the IOC's  
plans for an anti-drug agency. McCaffrey said this week the project 
is unacceptable because it lacks accountability and independence. 
He called the IOC untrustworthy and ``Byzantine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a four-page letter, a copy of which was obtained Friday by  
The Associated Press, Pound urged McCaffrey to tackle the drug 
problem in his own back yard. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States ``could contribute a great deal ... were its  
own policies clear, unequivocal and fully implemented in its own 
territory,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound cited an ``enormous disconnect'' between McCaffrey's  
attacks on the IOC and the drug situation in professional sports in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Performance-enhancing drugs are widely used and apparently  
regularly tolerated,'' Pound said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC official also took another swipe at Mark McGwire, who  
acknowledged using androstenedione last season when he hit a record 
70 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some sports, the national icons freely admit to using drugs  
that are prohibited within the Olympic movement,'' Pound said. 
</P>
<P>
	Androstenedione, which is legal in major league baseball, is on  
the IOC's list of banned steroids. McGwire said earlier this season 
he had stopped using the product. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound suggested the anti-drug fight was being compromised in the  
United States by the threat of lawsuits against drug suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you wanted the U.S. to demonstrate leadership in this vital  
area, you could find a mechanism to insulate (international sports 
federations) from the ruinous exposure and expense that such 
lawsuits entail,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound also complained that the IOC had not received a reply to a  
letter it sent last May to McCaffrey and the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration expressing concern over the ineffective labeling of 
dietary supplements. Many of these supplements, available 
over-the-counter and advertised on the Internet, contain banned 
substances. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said he had hoped to discuss plans for the anti-drug  
agency in meetings with McCaffrey earlier this year. But he said 
two scheduled meetings were canceled by McCaffrey's staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been more helpful ... for you to have provided  
input regarding the international consensus than simply to 
criticize the valuable work that has been accomplished,'' Pound 
said. ``Casting doubt upon the genuineness of the commitment of 
those involved in the international effort is not helpful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said the framework for the agency had been backed by the  
European Union, United Nations, World Health Organization, Interpol 
and other bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	He reiterated that the IOC plans to set up the agency by the end  
of this year and have it in place for next year's Sydney Olympics. 
With the IOC putting up an initial $25 million in funding, the 
agency will coordinate drug-testing around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said it was agreed earlier this year that no single  
constituency would control the agency, that Olympic leaders and 
government officials would be equally represented. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the IOC is resolved to proceed ``with or without the  
participation of public authorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound defended the IOC's record on drugs, saying, ``No other  
organization in the world has done more than the IOC in the 
struggle against doping in sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the IOC has backed plans for unannounced  
out-of-competition tests, funded research into developing tests for 
EPO and human growth hormone, and promised to implement blood tests 
once a reliable analysis is established.

<HEADLINE> Ousted Mayor Sues Miami Herald </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Former Mayor Xavier Suarez has filed a libel suit  
against The Miami Herald, accusing the newspaper of portraying him 
as unstable in its Pulitzer Prize-winning coverage of his 
fraud-riddled election. 
</P>
<P>
	Suarez complained about both news stories and columns, citing,  
among others, columnist Carl Hiaasen, who repeatedly called Suarez 
``Mayor Loco'' in print. The lawsuit was filed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Herald managing editor Larry Olmstead called the lawsuit  
groundless. 
</P>
<P>
	Suarez, a lawyer, said the Herald caused him to lose standing in  
Miami's legal community. He estimated the stories cost him $100,000 
in earnings in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	A voter-fraud scandal following the 1997 mayoral election led to  
criminal charges against 57 people, but not Suarez. 
</P>
<P>
	Suarez led Miami through most of the 1980s, but a state appeals  
court threw out his most recent victory and named Joe Carollo 
mayor.

	Kinkel Pleads Guilty to Murder  
</P>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Abandoning an insanity defense, Kip Kinkel,  
17, pleaded guilty today to murdering his parents at home and then 
shooting to death two classmates at Springfield's Thurston High 
School. He could get a life sentence. Kinkel had told investigators 
after his arrest that he had ``no choice'' but to kill after 
shaming his parents by getting expelled from school. His attorneys 
had hoped to spare him life in prison by proving he was insane, or 
at least disturbed to the point that he was not fully in control of 
his actions. Because he was just 15 at the time of the crimes, 
Kinkel never faced the death penalty.

hinterland had been emptied and torched, multinational peacekeeping 
troops on Friday searched house-to-house for militia suspects in 
East Timor's capital. About 1,000 multinational troops, backed by 
armored personnel carriers and two Blackhawk helicopters, sealed

a three-year trial. After four days of deliberations, the jury of 
two judges and six private citizens concluded there was no proof to 
convict Andreotti, 80, one of Italy's most powerful and enduring 
politicians. Andreotti, who was premier seven times and is a

and editor. Hachette Filipacchi Magazines, which shared ownership 
of the magazine with Kennedy, announced Friday the magazine would 
cut back to 10 issues a year from 12 next year but would guarantee 
advertisers a larger circulation. Starting with the February 2000

inappropriate remarks and physical contact'' with Tampa Bay catcher 
Mike DeFelice during and following the Devils Rays' game against 
the Anaheim Angels on Monday.

	Aid Sent to Victims of Russia Blast  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Trucks carrying tons of aid for victims of a  
Russian apartment blast have arrived in the city of Volgodonsk, the 
ITAR-Tass news agency reported today. The aid for the hundreds of 
people left homeless by the Sept. 18 explosion included food and 
clothing along with construction materials such as doors and 
windows. Volgodonsk is about 500 miles south of Moscow. The blast, 
in which 18 people died, was one of four apartment explosions this 
month that killed some 300 people. Authorities blame the blasts on 
Islamic militants from breakaway Chechnya.

Russia and other countries don't misuse the billions of dollars the 
IMF provides in loans. While insisting the administration's overall

slowly. It was many hours before they sent in troops to rescue 
victims and many hours until they sent helicopters,'' said Tsai

<HEADLINE> Worries About Vietnam Nagged LBJ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- On Election Day 1964, on the brink of one of  
the biggest presidential landslides ever, Lyndon Johnson lay in bed 
at 5 p.m., nursing a headache and sore hip -- and sorting out his 
conflicted thoughts about whether to escalate U.S. involvement in 
Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	On newly released presidential tape recordings, Johnson yawns  
noisily into the phone and complains about his back, head and hip 
pains. Yet he ignores advice from his assistant Bill Moyers to take 
a break and celebrate his victory under the Florida sun. Something 
troubled him deeply. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm afraid of Vietnam,'' Johnson tells Moyers in a hoarse  
voice. 
</P>
<P>
	The conversation is among 36 hours of recorded conversations  
released Friday by the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library. Most of the 
tapes were recorded in November and December 1964 as Johnson, who 
became president after President Kennedy's assassination in 1963, 
was elected to his own four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
	The tapes capture Johnson's earthy and domineering persona. He  
exchanges oral backslaps on election night and chats about civil 
rights with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. In the King phone call, 
Johnson calls his victory, which was heavily supported by black 
voters, ``a great tribute to the intelligence and the judgment and 
the patriotism of the Negro people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wonders aloud how large his win will be. He chuckles -- even  
snorts -- on the tapes and jokes about how his running mate, Hubert 
H. Humphrey from Minnesota, had donned Western duds and hopped on a 
horse at the LBJ ranch in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	But the tapes also show a president burdened by Vietnam and  
still undecided about America's response to communist actions in 
Southeast Asia. It wasn't until March 1965 that Marines, the first 
U.S. combat troops, landed in South Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon, antiwar protesters would chant, ``Hey! Hey! LBJ! How many  
kids did you kill today?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are two schools of thought on this,'' said Michael  
Beschloss, a presidential historian who is writing three books on 
the Johnson tapes. ``One is that Johnson came to the presidency in 
November 1963 desperate to escalate the war in Vietnam. The other 
is that he believed in the American commitment to South Vietnam, 
but that as late as the end of 1964, he was open-minded on how to 
carry that out. 
</P>
<P>
	``What these tapes show is that he was still keeping his counsel  
and actually still soliciting recommendations as late as Election 
Day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after the election, Johnson asks former Attorney  
General Robert F. Kennedy, ``If you get any solution for Vietnam, 
just call me direct, will you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the same phone call, Johnson warns of moving too fast on  
Vietnam. He tells Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield, D-Mont., 
that he has received ``some pretty strong ideas'' from 
congressional leaders. But he says: ``I sent them back and told 
them, 'Let's be careful. Let's, let's look where we're going before 
we go.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Later that same day, Johnson asks Defense Secretary Robert  
McNamara for an update on Vietnam. ``It's just a worrisome 
problem,'' McNamara tells him. ``None of us have a pat answer that 
we're ready to give you yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walt Rostow, director of policy planning at the State Department  
in late 1964, said in a telephone interview that Johnson was still 
weighing the decision about troops in early 1965. ``He didn't wait 
until the election was over and say, 'Well now, let's go,''' Rostow 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his worries about Vietnam, the tapes also reveal  
Johnson's teasing and cajoling. 
</P>
<P>
	He jokes with congressional leaders about Vice President-elect  
Humphrey, who was bunking at Johnson's ranch right after the 
election. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did you hear what Hubert announced in his speech here?''  
Johnson asks the leaders who were gathered in a room on the other 
end of the line. ``By God, he said he'd resign if there was any 
more horseback riding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Humphrey jokes that his Western clothes were ``droopy,'' and  
blames it on Johnson. ``After all, the president was the man that 
dressed me,'' Humphrey says. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson asks Sen. Ross Bass, D-Tenn., how he thought Humphrey  
looked on a horse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll tell you what. That's a desecration to put him on a  
Tennessee walking horse,'' jokes Bass. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is that a desecration of Hubert or the horse?'' Johnson says  
in a quick comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	Humphrey breaks out laughing.

<HEADLINE> Former Nurse Taken Sick at Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRAZIL, Ind. (AP) -- A former nurse charged with killing seven  
elderly patients with drug injections was hurried from court to a 
hospital today, suffering from what the judge later called a 
``nervous stomach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Orville Lynn Majors Jr. became ill about five minutes after his  
attorneys began presenting their case and was taken from the 
courthouse in an ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
	He was released about two hours later and returned to jail.  
</P>
<P>
	Judge Ernest Yelton, who had dismissed the jury until next week,  
followed Majors to the hospital. He said doctors determined Majors' 
blood pressure was elevated and the initial diagnosis was acute 
gastritis. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctor said the best way to explain that is he had a very  
nervous stomach brought on by irritation and anxiety,'' Yelton 
said. ``The doctor is very comfortable he will be able to return to 
court on Monday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lead defense attorney I. Marshall Pinkus said Majors has high  
blood pressure and diabetes and has been receiving medication for 
the ailments while in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	``His stomach was real upset this morning. He does have high  
blood pressure. He just didn't act the same to me. He looked pretty 
pale,'' Pinkus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Majors, 38, faces life in prison if convicted in the deaths of  
the patients at Vermillion County Hospital. His trial began Sept. 
7. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said medical experts will testify that each death  
was consistent with injections of potassium chloride. Vials 
containing traces of the drug and syringes were found at Majors' 
home and in his van, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Majors and his lawyers say all of the patients died of natural  
causes.

<HEADLINE>  Stocks Dip; Dow Ends Off 39.26 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rounded out a dismal week with a volatile  
session but generally modest losses Friday. Investors continued 
selling semiconductor stocks, but made some cautious overtures 
toward battered shares of Internet and financial companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 39.26 to close at  
10,279.33. The Dow finished the week 524.30 points below last 
Friday's close, a loss of 4.9 percent. It was the first time the 
Dow has ever lost more than 500 points in a single week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow has now dropped 1,046.71, or 9.2 percent, below its  
record close of 11,326.04, set Aug. 25. But it is still up nearly 
12 percent for all of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also ended lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 fell 3.05 to 1,277.36, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 9.42 
to 2,740.41. 
</P>
<P>
	With little news to move the market, investors fell prey to the  
momentum that dragged the Dow below 10,500 on Thursday. Analysts 
consider 10,500 a ``technical support'' level, and most have long 
forecast that a drop below that level would prompt further selling 
as investors fear the market is approaching a major, enduring 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will take days, or maybe weeks, before the market  
stabilizes,'' said Tom Galvin, chief equity strategist at 
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday, investors remained focused on fears that technology  
stocks, the market's strongest performers for most of 1999, are 
faltering. 
</P>
<P>
	The market continued to suffer from Microsoft president Steve  
Ballmer's remarks Thursday that technology stocks -- including 
Microsoft -- are too highly priced. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market was looking for a reason to sell off and he gave it  
a reason,'' said Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at 
George K. Baum &AMP; Co., in Kansas City, Mo. ``The market needs 
catalysts in terms of corrections and this was the catalyst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks also came under selling pressure amid concerns  
that the earthquake that hit Taiwan earlier this week will hurt 
production of computer chips and may force price increases. Taiwan 
is a major semiconductor producer. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft slipped 1/4 to 90 15/16, and Intel fell 1 53/64 to 75  
43/64. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyclical companies, whose fortunes tend to mirror the strength  
of the overall economy, sustained some heavy losses. Minnesota 
Mining &AMP; Manufacturing dropped 3 7/16 to 91 13/16, the worst 
performer in the Dow. 
</P>
<P>
	By early afternoon, some buyers were treading cautiously back  
into the market. America Online rose 10 to 97 1/2, a gain analysts 
attributed to Microsoft's decision to raise Internet access fees. 
That could prevent AOL from succumbing to price competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial companies had some strength, with American Express  
rising 1 to 136 3/8 and Bank of America gaining 3 1/16 to 57 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's losses came despite some positive economic news. The  
dollar rose slightly against the Japanese yen for the second 
straight day, edging up to 104.15 yen from 103.95 late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. currency has been lingering near its lowest levels  
against the yen since 1996, and its weakness has been a big factor 
in the stock market's selloff this week. A lower dollar makes 
imports more expensive and it also makes foreign investments more 
attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the National Association of Realtors reported sales  
of existing homes fell by a bigger-than-expected 2.8 percent in 
August, the second straight decline after hitting a record high in 
June. The realtor group cited rising interest rates as the reason 
for the drop. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest rates remain a powerful force in the market as the  
Federal Reserve's Oct. 5 meeting draws near. Many analysts expect 
the Fed to raise rates for the third time this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether the central bank raises rates or holds them steady, the  
decision could lead to a market recovery, Galvin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market will grind along the bottom until then,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. Composite volume totaled 1.04 billion 
shares, compared with 1.06 billion the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 3.12 to 417.09.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas indexes plunged, following Thursday's weak showing on  
Wall Street. Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 2.62 percent. In 
Europe, Germany's DAX index lost 2.1 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 
fell 0.5 percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 1.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Angelica Huston Honored in Spain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN SEBASTIAN, Spain (AP) -- Anjelica Huston was relaxed and  
animated as she talked about two key people in her film career: her 
father, the late director John Huston, and her former lover, actor 
Jack Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
	The actress was here Friday to receive the San Sebastian Film  
Festival's Donostia award for her contribution to film. She shares 
the prize with Vanessa Redgrave and Spanish actor and director 
Fernando Fernan Gomez-Gomez. 
</P>
<P>
	Huston said she learned the most from her father.  
</P>
<P>
	``For the first twelve years of my life I lived in Ireland and I  
was raised exclusively on his films. Obviously he was my first 
teacher,'' said Huston. 
</P>
<P>
	She won an Oscar for best supporting actress for her role in  
``Prizzi's Honor,'' which also starred Nicholson. Huston and 
Nicholson had broken up by the time they starred together in 1995's 
``The Crossing Guard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In my mind the relationship was unresolved because of outside  
elements, but after doing that film with Jack I felt that noone 
else could have done that film, I don't regret it,'' Huston said.

<HEADLINE> Tired Teen-Agers Need More Sleep </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Your teen-ager insists she cannot fall asleep  
until after midnight. Every morning means yelling to wake her up in 
time to be at school by 7:15 a.m. She loves history class, but it 
is first period and many days she snoozes through it. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the daily grind for millions of students and their  
parents. If it is any comfort, scientists say it is not the 
teen-ager's fault: Biology is behind adolescents' sleep problems, 
and earlier bells at the nation's high schools are turning many 
students into zombies. 
</P>
<P>
	You cannot just order a sleepy teen-ager to bed earlier and  
expect the problem solved. 
</P>
<P>
	Sophisticated studies of teen-agers' sleep patterns show  
adolescents need more slumber -- 9 hours and 15 minutes -- than the 
eight hours recommended for adults. 
</P>
<P>
	But sometime in late puberty, the body secretes the  
sleep-related hormone melatonin at a different time than normal -- 
changing the ``circadian rhythms'' that guide people's sleep-wake 
cycles. So even if you somehow get your teen-ager to turn out the 
lights at 10 p.m., he may just stare at the ceiling until 1 a.m. 
waiting to doze off. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider, too, that many high schools have pushed up the  
starting bell as early as 7:15 a.m., and the average American 
teen-ager gets 6.5 hours of sleep on a school night, some lots 
less. 
</P>
<P>
	Those missing hours of slumber each night add up, depriving  
teen-agers of the benefits that Shakespeare described as knitting 
up ``the ravell'd sleeve of care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sleep deprivation cripples memory and inhibits creativity,  
meaning tired students do not learn much. 
</P>
<P>
	The teen-age years are a struggle to learn to deal with stress  
and control emotion -- irritability, lack of self-confidence and 
mood swings often are common, but sleep deprivation worsens it all. 
</P>
<P>
	There also is evidence that enough sleep is important for a  
robust immune system. 
</P>
<P>
	Worse, many bleary-eyed students are driving to school in the  
morning, and at other times when their body is yearning for a nap. 
Scientists do not know how many car crashes involving teen-age 
drivers are sleep-related, but say it clearly is a safety risk that 
needs serious investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Parents, educators don't understand this,'' complains famed  
sleep researcher Dr. William Dement of Stanford University, who 
helped discover the vital ``rapid eye movement'' or REM stage of 
deep sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	``What can we do about it?'' he asked sleep experts gathered by  
the prestigious National Academy of Sciences this week to determine 
how to educate Americans about the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Conventional wisdom is that your body adjusts to less sleep.  
</P>
<P>
	Not so, insists Dr. Mary Carskadon of Brown University, who  
intensively has studied adolescent sleep. ``Your brain doesn't get 
used to it,'' she warns. 
</P>
<P>
	Carskadon put monitors on sleep-deprived teen-agers. Twelve out  
of 25 could fall into REM sleep in a startling 3 to 4 minutes, far 
faster than a healthy adult can sleep so deeply. In fact, a doctor 
glancing at those test results would assume those 12 teens were 
narcoleptics, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But their ability to nap snapped off around 7:30 p.m., when  
teen-agers' unusual circadian rhythm kicked in to make them fully 
alert. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to such science, some Minnesota schools have moved  
back start times from 7:20 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. It is too early for 
proof, but researchers are reporting better grades and fewer 
discipline problems. 
</P>
<P>
	But changing schools is difficult. Aside from cutting into  
teen-agers' time for after-school jobs or sports practice, most 
school systems use the same buses for elementary through high 
school, letting the littlest kids go in later. Opening high schools 
later means more buses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not in any way, shape or form inexpensive,'' said Mona  
Signer of the Montgomery County, Md., school board, which last year 
said the $1.7 million tab made opening high schools later too 
pricey. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., has introduced legislation that  
would give small grants to school systems that make the change, but 
acknowledges it has no chance of passing Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Academy of Sciences plans to help parents and  
schools learn more by distributing free fact sheets with all the 
proven science regarding adolescent sleep needs early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the National Sleep Foundation offers advice:  
</P>
<P>
	--Stay away from caffeine and nicotine, both stimulants, after  
noon. Also avoid alcohol, which can disrupt sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	--Heavy studying or computer games before bed are arousing, as is  
trying to sleep with a computer or TV flickering in the room. 
</P>
<P>
	--Avoid bright light in the evening, but open blinds or turn on  
lights as soon the morning alarm sounds to jumpstart the body's 
awakening cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	--Sleeping more than two or three hours later than on weekends  
than weekdays can disrupt your body clock even more, making Monday 
morning harder. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ex-Gov. Edwards Faces More Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Former Gov. Edwin Edwards is facing more  
federal charges, this time stemming from his role in the settlement 
of a failed insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards was charged Friday with fraud and conspiracy for  
allegedly charging a $100,000 fee to set up a meeting between the 
owner of Cascade Insurance Co. and its court-appointed overseers. 
Authorities say the payment came after he was out of office. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards already faces a Jan. 10 federal racketeering trial with  
six others. In that investigation, the defendants are accused of 
manipulating the state's riverboat licensing procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	Five others also were indicted Friday, including a state judge  
and state Insurance Commissioner Jim Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI wiretaps of Edwards' telephone calls apparently picked up  
conversations between Edwards and Cascade owner David Disiere, also 
indicted Friday. Cascade failed in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards, who did not return telephone calls Friday, has said he  
merely acted as an attorney when he set up meetings between Disiere 
and the court-appointed overseer. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, elected in 1991 as a reformer, is the third-straight  
insurance commissioner to be indicted on federal charges for his 
dealings while in office. The previous two went to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said Friday he is innocent and that he did not have the  
authority to be involved in the Cascade settlement. He also claimed 
prosecutors purposely handed down the indictments just before the 
Oct. 23 primary and that a gag order that prohibits him from 
discussing the case will not allow him to tell his side of the 
story to the voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prosecutors have chosen to bring this indictment just a  
few weeks before the election, knowing full well that I would not 
have time to defend or exonerate myself before election day,'' 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Eddie Jordan said the timing was driven by the  
evidence in the case, and was not politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted on all charges, Brown could be sentenced to 290  
years in prison and fined nearly $14 million while Edwards and the 
others could get up to 230 years in prison and nearly $12 million 
in fines.

<HEADLINE> Bishops Want Catholic Colleges Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- America's Roman Catholic bishops are moving  
toward tighter control over what the nation's Catholic colleges and 
universities teach. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the U.S. hierarchy's 54-member board approved a  
policy proposal that will be voted on at a November meeting of all 
of the nation's bishops. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal is largely similar to a 1998 draft that provoked  
strong attacks from Catholic educators. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal requires that theology teachers have the  
endorsement of bishops in order to teach. That would make them 
subject to removal in cases of conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal also says that ``to the extent possible,'' the  
majority of board members and teachers should be committed 
Catholics. And college presidents are expected to take an oath of 
fidelity to the church and its teachings. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy would apply to 235 Catholic colleges with 670,000  
students. 
</P>
<P>
	If two thirds of the bishops approve the text, it will go to the  
Vatican for endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Charles Currie, executive director of the Jesuit  
college association, said he hopes it does not pass in its current 
form. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look forward to working with the bishops over coming weeks  
and hope to come up with something everybody can be relatively 
happy with,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities contends  
that the proposed controls could endanger public aid, threatening 
the survival of some schools, and would violate academic procedures 
and civil law. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the latest turn in a nine-year struggle in which the  
U.S. bishops have tried to balance the views of the pope with those 
of American advocates of academic freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	Catholic conservatives say some church-affiliated colleges are  
nearly indistinguishable from secular campuses. Catholics have 
tangled over theology professors criticizing church policy, 
commencement speakers in favor of abortion rights, gay student 
clubs and crucifixes on classroom walls.

<HEADLINE> Runners Embark on 152-Mile Marathon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Following the footsteps of an ancient  
Greek messenger, 190 runners set out from the foot of the Acropolis 
at dawn Friday on a punishing 152-mile journey from Athens to 
Sparta, nearly six times the distance of a marathon. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletes from 27 countries, many with bottles of water strapped  
to their back, will run along old highways, dirt tracks and up 
steep mountain passes, hoping to arrive at their destination by 
nightfall Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wim Epskamp, 45-year-old Dutchman, was leading the race at  
Corinth, 52 miles west of Athens, after two-time winner Costas 
Repos of Greece dropped out with stomach cramps. Japan's Kimie 
Funada was leading a dozen women, ahead of American favorite Ann 
Trason. 
</P>
<P>
	The race, known as the Spartathlon, traces the legendary course  
run by the messenger Pheidippides nearly 2,500 years ago to enlist 
the help Sparta's warrior kingdom which had allied with rival 
Athens against a Persian invasion. The run was recorded by the 
ancient historian Herodotus. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spartathlon has been held every year since 1982, when five  
officers from Britain's Royal Air Force put history to the test, 
running along the route described by the historian. 
</P>
<P>
	About half the field usually quit because of blisters or  
exhaustion. For those who finish, the prize is decidedly Spartan: a 
drink of local water and an olive wreath placed on their head. 
</P>
<P>
	``This race is not about speed. It's endurance and  
determination,'' said John Foden, who led the British team in 1982 
and is a spectator this year. ``The most difficult part is the 
climb up the mountains in the dark over rough track. Sometimes it 
can be very cold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spartathlon record, 20 hours and 25 minutes, was set by  
Yiannis Kouros of Greece in 1984, and is three hours faster than 
any other athlete has completed the race. Kouros broke a long 
string ultra-distance records in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	A campaign is being pushed to have the Spartathlon staged as an  
exhibition event before the start of the 2004 Olympic Games in 
Athens. 
</P>
<P>
	Pheidippides' run to Sparta may have been unnecessary. The  
advancing forces from the vast Persian Empire were defeated at the 
Battle of Marathon in 490 B.C., before the Spartans arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	But not all his efforts were in vain. According to Greek legend,  
Pheidippides fought with other Athenian soldiers against the 
Persians and ran from the battleground to Athens to announce ``we 
have won'' -- before dropping dead with exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
	His last 26 miles inspired another race, the marathon.

<HEADLINE> AL Umpire Suspended Three Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- John Shulock became the second umpire to be  
disciplined this season when he was suspended by the American 
League today for three games for his ``display of temper'' in a 
game this week. 
</P>
<P>
	AL president Gene Budig, in his first major decision since being  
told his position was being terminated by commissioner Bud Selig, 
suspended Shulock for the final three games his crew is to work 
this season and fined him an undisclosed amount. 
</P>
<P>
	The penalties were levied, Budig said, for Shulock's ``overly  
aggressive behavior, display of temper, inappropriate remarks and 
physical contact'' with Tampa Bay catcher Mike DeFelice during and 
following the Devils Rays' game against the Anaheim Angels on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shulock apparently became upset with DeFelice during the third  
inning of the Angels' 10-5 victory, a game in which the Devil Rays 
complained about the umpire's ball and strike calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The trouble began when Devils Rays pitcher Wilson Alvarez threw  
a fastball that struck Shulock in the mask. DeFelice barely raised 
his mitt to catch the pitch, and the ball squarely struck Shulock. 
</P>
<P>
	Shulock, unhurt, straightened up and slowly headed toward the  
mound. DeFelice caught up with the umpire as Tampa Bay manager 
Larry Rothschild came out of the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	Shulock and Alvarez argued briefly, but the umpire did not eject  
the pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, Shulock said, ``The more I think about it, I  
think he (Alvarez) did it intentionally. I can't prove it, but I'm 
upset, and I have a right to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the season, National League umpire Tom Hallion was  
suspended for three games without pay for allegedly bumping 
Colorado catcher Jeff Reed and pitching coach Milt May. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Tata, working the game with Hallion, denied Hallion had  
made contact with Reed and May. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball officials couldn't recall another suspension of an  
umpire for an on-field dispute.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Jailed Correspondent Gets Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Endre Marton now has a complete record of the  
interrogation he withstood more than four decades ago in a 
Hungarian prison. 
</P>
<P>
	His country was under Communist rule, and Marton, a  
correspondent for The Associated Press in Budapest, and his wife, 
Ilona, who worked for United Press, were jailed for 15 months on 
charges of espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	She was placed in a separate cell. They managed to communicate  
through coded tappings on the bars. 
</P>
<P>
	Marton was freed in time to cover the Hungarian revolution in  
1956, an abortive attempt to throw off Soviet control, and they 
left for the United States soon afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday night, the Hungarian foreign minister, Janos  
Martonyi, presented Marton, 88, with Hungary's Officers Cross of 
the Order of Merit and paid tribute to the couple's ``tenacious 
courage when they were fighting for freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the award, which was received by Kati Marton, their  
daughter, was a thick envelope containing a transcript of Marton's 
interrogation. 
</P>
<P>
	The minister paid tribute to the Martons for their ``tenacious  
courage when they were fighting for freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremonial dinner was hosted by Kati Marton's husband,  
Richard C. Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. 
The Martons did not attend, Kati Marton explaining that her mother 
was not well and that her father would not leave her in alone in 
their home in Bethesda, Md., to come to New York for the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Marton wrote of his experience in a memoir, ``The Forbidden  
Sky.'' Until his retirement in 1975, he worked as a reporter for 
The Associated Press at the State Department.

<HEADLINE> Senate Approves $97 Million Measure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate approved a $97 billion measure  
Friday financing next year's housing, veterans and science 
programs, despite a White House veto threat over shortfalls for 
some environmental and public housing efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure was approved by voice vote. The next step is for  
senators to try crafting a compromise with the House, which 
approved its version two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill is $2.5 billion below what President Clinton  
requested. But it provides $5 billion more than the House approved, 
making it much closer to what the legislation's likely final 
version. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's strongest objections include the Senate's  
failure to provide any of the 50,000 new vouchers Clinton requested 
for low-income people to use paying rent. Overall, the Senate 
measure would provide $1 billion less than Clinton wanted for 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate also provided $186 million less than Clinton wanted  
for overall operations of the Environmental Protection Agency, and 
$100 million less than he wanted for hazardous waste cleanups. The 
Senate would provide $7.3 billion for the EPA, $100 million more 
than Clinton requested, but far outspend him for individual 
projects in lawmakers' districts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate would provide the same $13.6 billion that Clinton  
sought for NASA, but approved $120 million less than he proposed 
for NASA's space science programs. Space science includes the 
Hubble space telescope and the Mars Pathfinder. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill also would provide $19 billion for veterans'  
health care, $1.7 billion more than Clinton sought. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Congress has sent Clinton just four of the 13 annual  
spending bills for fiscal 2000, which begins next Friday. The 
administration has threatened to veto seven of the measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress plans to send Clinton a bill next week temporarily  
keeping agencies open for three additional weeks while the two 
sides work out differences.

<HEADLINE> Kinkel Pleads Guilty to Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Kip Kinkel, the meek-looking teen-ager who  
killed his parents and gunned down two classmates at school, 
abandoned an insanity defense Friday and pleaded guilty to murder 
in a deal that could someday let him walk free. 
</P>
<P>
	The plea bargain came three days before Kinkel was to go on  
trial in the May 21, 1998, attack at Springfield's Thurston High 
School -- the third in a string of school shootings that included 
Pearl, Miss., Paducah, Ky., Jonesboro, Ark., and Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinkel could get as little as 25 years, meaning he could be free  
by age 42. If he had been convicted as charged, he could have faced 
life in prison without parole. No sentencing date was set. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mind is clear and I am not sick,'' read the text of the  
plea agreement signed by the 17-year-old Kinkel. He sat slumped in 
a chair in court and never lifted his head as he read each 
paragraph silently and initialed it ``KK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He pleaded guilty to four counts of murder and 26 of attempted  
murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, he will get a total of 25 years for the  
murders. Prosecutors have recommended 7 1/2 years for each attempted 
murder count for the 25 students he wounded and a detective he 
attacked with a knife. The judge will decide whether those 
sentences will be tacked onto the end of the 25-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Doug Harcleroad called the deal ``the best  
thing for the community'' and refused to comment on the possibility 
of a 25-year sentence. He noted that survivors of the attack will 
get a chance to speak before Kinkel is sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released by her lawyer, Kinkel's sister, Kristin,  
22, said she hoped the plea agreement will mean her brother will 
get the help he needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very sad, but relieved,'' she said in the statement.  
``Sad that this day had to even happen. Sad that there are so many 
innocent victims. Sad that I lost another member of my family. But 
relieved that the painful memories of those tragic events of 16 
months ago will not be revived by a trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because Kinkel was 15 at the time of the slayings, he could not  
have faced the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyers had hoped to spare him a life sentence by proving he  
was mentally disturbed. If they had succeeded, Kinkel would have 
been confined to a mental hospital until he was no longer deemed a 
danger to society. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinkel told investigators he had ``no choice'' but to kill  
because he had embarrassed his parents by getting expelled for 
having a gun in his locker. He said he thought he was a 
disappointment to his parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to be 100 percent,'' Kinkel told a psychiatrist. ``No  
one is perfect though. Lots of times, life sucked. With my parents, 
if I didn't do the best, I was an embarrassment to my parents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kinkel shot his parents in their home. The following morning, he  
dressed in a trench coat, walked into the cafeteria just before 
classes and opened fire with a semiautomatic rifle. He squeezed off 
50 rounds in 90 seconds, killing Ben Walker, 16, and Mikael 
Nickolauson, 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Several classmates tackled Kinkel as he tried to reload. Later,  
in a jail interview room, Kinkel lunged at a detective with a knife 
that had been taped to his leg and begged police to kill him. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Financier May Need Public Defender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Martin Frankel is accused of embezzling  
hundreds of millions of dollars to live a life of luxury, but his 
lawyer claims the rogue financier doesn't have enough money to pay 
his legal bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Hugh Keefe on Friday said he plans to withdraw  
as Frankel's lawyer because federal officials have frozen all of 
Frankel's assets and rejected requests to release a portion of the 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you were to believe the government, he's allegedly one of  
the great white-collar criminals of our time, but if he is, he 
certainly doesn't have any funds to hire a private lawyer,'' Keefe 
told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can't very well mount a defense unless he gets some of the  
money they seized from him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Delcie Thibault, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in  
Connecticut, declined to say how much the government has seized or 
comment on Keefe's claims. A message left seeking comment from an 
FBI spokeswoman in Connecticut was not returned Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators say Frankel's unlicensed brokerage siphoned at least  
$218 million from insurers in Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, 
Oklahoma and Tennessee. A lawsuit filed by some of the companies 
puts the loss much higher, at $915 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel, a 44-year-old money manager from Greenwich, fled the  
United States in May. 
</P>
<P>
	When Frankel was arrested in a hotel room in Hamburg, Germany,  
on Sept. 4, authorities seized more than $1 million in cash and 
diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, the FBI seized one of the two mansions Frankel kept in  
Greenwich. The IRS seized the second estate earlier this month, 
alleging it was bought with money from a Swiss bank account into 
which Frankel had deposited $44 million he stole from the insurance 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	State regulators have seized $57.5 million and were seeking  
another $26.5 million in a frozen Swiss bank account linked to 
Frankel. 
</P>
<P>
	Keefe said he has notified the federal public defender's office  
in Connecticut that they may have to appoint someone to defend 
Frankel. Thomas G. Dennis, chief federal public defender, did not 
return messages left Friday.

<HEADLINE> Fox Appeals Ruling on Turner Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Fox Sports Net South is appealing a lower court  
ruling that allowed Turner South, a new regional network, to 
broadcast Atlanta baseball, football and hockey games. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Rowland  
Barnes denied Fox Sports' request for an injunction. The network 
was attempting to prevent Turner South from including the 
Thrashers, Hawks and Braves as part of its programming lineup, 
beginning Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox filed its appeal Thursday with the Georgia Supreme Court and  
said in a statement that it ``intends to pursue all legal and 
equitable remedies available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No date has been set for a briefing in the matter, at which the  
court would decide whether to grant Fox's appeal a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox sued in June, claiming that the new network violates a  
12-year non-compete agreement that was part of a $65 million deal 
the companies struck in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Boy Arrested After Infant's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LYNN, Mass. (AP) -- A 10-year-old boy pleaded innocent to a  
juvenile charge of murder Friday in the death of his 5-week-old 
relative whose body was found stuffed in a knapsack in a bedroom 
closet. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested the boy, who was not identified because of his  
age, after finding the infant boy's body in the house where the two 
lived, prosecutors said. Authorities did not say how the two were 
related or what led them to the young suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	There was ``significant evidence of trauma'' to the infant,  
Essex County District Attorney Kevin Burke said without 
elaborating. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of death had not been determined, prosecutors said. An  
autopsy was scheduled for Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Etoya Vaughn, 22, called authorities to her home about 3:45 a.m.  
Friday, saying she could not find her son, Davion, police said. 
After finding no signs of forced entry to the home, officers went 
inside and found the body. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect was ordered held for 20 days and is scheduled to  
re-appear in juvenile court on Oct. 14. If convicted, he could be 
committed to the Department of Youth Services until the age of 18, 
Burke said.

<HEADLINE> Detroit Teachers Get New Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Detroit teachers who went on strike earlier this  
month voted Friday to ratify a three-year contract, a union 
representative said. 
</P>
<P>
	Union members voted 6,328 to 2,058 to accept the contract, which  
gives all teachers a 2 percent raise each year for the next three 
years. Teachers with more seniority and education will receive 
higher raises to keep up with wages in suburban districts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm satisfied. I'm encouraged by the vote and the margin of  
the yes and no,'' union President John Elliott said. ``Quite 
frankly, the members voted in their best interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott said nearly 11,000 of the Detroit Federation of  
Teachers' 11,500 members were eligible to vote. Teachers secretly 
voted at their work locations. 
</P>
<P>
	Students in Detroit missed the first six days of school after  
union members voted against a 10-day contract extension while 
negotiations continued. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Conn, a Cass Technical High School math teacher who was  
one of the most vocal teachers during the strike, said teachers 
approved the contract by such a large margin because of the way the 
ballot was worded. 
</P>
<P>
	The ballot asked teachers to either accept the agreement or  
reject the contract and ``withhold'' services starting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's flat out untrue that we would be on strike. There's  
nothing that requires that we walk out on Monday,'' Conn said. ``I 
think if it was a fair yes-no vote, it would have been much 
closer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conn had said before the tentative settlement was announced  
earlier this month that teachers would vote down any contract 
offer. In fact, he urged teachers to reject the settlement before 
details of the contract were announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott said the union used the same ballot language it has used  
since the 1970s. He denied that the language was aimed at ensuring 
the contract would be approved. He did say, however, that the 
language probably should be changed for future votes. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 30, the day before classes were to begin, teachers  
rejected their union's proposal for a 10-day contract extension. 
Nine days later, teachers voted overwhelmingly to return to work, 
ending an extended summer vacation for 180,000 students. They also 
approved a temporary extension of their old contract until the 
union could hold a vote on the new deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The teachers had walked off the job because they were not happy  
about proposals for a longer school day, merit pay, and other 
proposals made by the new school reform board. 
</P>
<P>
	The new contract includes a plan to reduce class size in  
kindergarten through third grade. The deal also includes more 
restrictions on unexcused absences of teachers, which was a board 
priority.

<HEADLINE> Authors Debate Luck in Hollywood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- At a panel entitled ``Mangled at the Movies?,''  
four authors whose books have been adapted to the screen -- E.L. 
Doctorow, Walter Mosley, Scott Turow and Russell Banks -- pondered 
the results. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote? One mangled author, Doctorow. And three satisfied  
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a bill of indictment right here!'' Doctorow announced  
at the opening of Thursday's discussion, holding up a blank fold of 
papers. 
</P>
<P>
	The author has had four novels made into films, including  
``Ragtime,'' ``Billy Bathgate'' and ``Welcome to Hard Times.'' His 
reviews range from ``tepid'' for ``Billy Bathgate'' to ``the second 
worst movie ever made in Hollywood'' for ``Welcome to Hard Times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only ``Swamp Fire,'' a Johnny Weissmuller film from Doctorow's  
childhood, ranked lower. 
</P>
<P>
	But the other writers can either be called luckier or less  
demanding. Mosley said he loved the adaptation of his detective 
story, ``Devil in a Blue Dress,'' which starred Denzel Washington. 
Banks felt just as strongly about the film versions of ``The Sweet 
Hereafter'' and ``Affliction'' and Turow had only mild criticisms 
for the production of ``Presumed Innocent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel like I've been mangled in Hollywood,'' said  
Turow, whose legal thriller was made into a film starring Harrison 
Ford. ``There are many novelists who live off movie options. And 
God bless them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one could quite explain why some writers have been luck than  
others. Banks praised the directors of his movies: Atom Egoyan and 
Paul Schrader. But Doctorow worked with an Academy Award-winning 
filmmaker, Milos Forman, on ``Ragtime'' and ended up with what he 
called a 2 1-2 hour movie that was ``brilliant for the first 10 
minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All agreed money was a factor, both in allowing the rights of a  
book to be sold and in compromises that have to be made. Banks 
believed his projects succeeded because they involved relatively 
little money. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somewhere around $14 million you have to put black hats on the  
bad guys and white hats on the good guys,'' Banks said. ``I want to 
keep the gray hats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turow advised authors unhappy with movie adaptations not to  
``cash the check.'' He noted that there would always be 
``disjunctions'' in adapting a novel, calling movies ``nothing but 
an abridgment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And if any of them could keep one thing from their books?  
</P>
<P>
	Turow: ``The moral ambiguity.''  
</P>
<P>
	Banks: ```Moral ambiguity.' That means don't let them change the  
ending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctorow: ``The absolute ideal thing for me is to have the book  
bought and never made into a movie.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Candidates Like Home Schooling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The growing home school movement commanded an  
audience Friday with five of the nine Republicans running for 
president, each proclaiming that if parents want to teach their 
children at home, the government should let them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We view home schooling as something to be respected and  
something to be protected,'' Texas Gov. George W. Bush told a 
conference of the Home School Legal Defense Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``Respected for the energy and commitment of loving mothers and  
loving fathers. Protected -- protected -- from the interference of 
government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The candidates, who appeared separately in the Daughters of the  
American Revolution auditorium, were unanimous in their salute of 
the movement's progress. An association-sponsored study last spring 
showed that home-schooled students, numbering an estimated 1.5 
million, score well above the national median on standardized tests 
and often study above their normal grade level. 
</P>
<P>
	``No parent in America should be forced to send their child to a  
lousy school. Period,'' said publisher Steve Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've shamed the regular school systems with what you've  
achieved. For those who have carped and criticized and said, 'What 
about socialization?' ... you look at some of our schools, you call 
that socialization?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Bauer, an undersecretary in President's Reagan's Education  
Department, promised, ``When I'm in the White House, you will have 
a reliable friend for home schooling sitting in the Oval Office.'' 
Home-schooling parents are ``on the front lines, the cutting edge 
of the education debate,'' Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The speaker's roster of presidential candidates, including  
Republicans Pat Buchanan and Alan Keyes, plus independent New 
Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith, was testimony to the potency of education 
in this campaign and the growing appeal of home schooling among 
religious and political conservatives disenchanted with public 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the association was founded in 1983, when home schooling  
was not even legal in all 50 states as it is today, the number of 
children whose parents eschew schools for at-home lessons grew from 
a couple hundred to today's estimate of 1.5 million to 1.7 million, 
said HSLDA spokesman Richard Jefferson. 
</P>
<P>
	During a musical slide show between political speakers and  
prayer offerings, the audience -- sprinkled with baby strollers and 
slouched children in play clothes -- burst into applause when the 
screen flashed Patrick Henry's immortal line, ``Give me liberty or 
give me death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Farris, president of the Virginia-based association,  
said his 65,000-member families -- up from 29,000 in 1993 -- have 
just one message to Washington policymakers: ``Leave us alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush offered just a couple sentences on home schooling before  
launching into his standard stump speech. ``I know this might not 
be the proper forum for a political speech,'' Bush said. ``But I 
can't resist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He encouraged activism by his religious audience. ``The role of  
the president is to say to people of faith, 'You're welcome to help 
change America because changing hearts will change America for the 
better,''' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan Childress, visiting from Kalona, Iowa, with her  
home-schooled son, sported a Keyes campaign button. But, after 
hearing Bush, she told a reporter: ``Maybe it won't be so bad if he 
is elected. I'm beginning to feel like I can more trust what he's 
saying.''

<HEADLINE> Gold Rises; Its up 5 Pct. for Week  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Gold futures extended their strongest rally of the year Friday  
on the New York Mercantile Exchange, registering a 5 percent gain 
for the week as traders' confidence in the battered metal grew. 
</P>
<P>
	Palladium and platinum prices sank in response to gold's rise.  
In other markets, wheat futures advanced significantly and pork 
bellies soared 5 percent higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold snapped out of an extended slump last Tuesday after an  
auction of British reserves drew higher-than-expected prices. The 
rally continued for a fourth day, sending prices to their highest 
level since March at $272.40 an ounce before settling back 
slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold for December delivery closed up $2.50 at $269.80 per troy  
ounce on the Comex division of the New York Merc. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices remain down 6 percent for the year, a decline attributed  
to central banks dumping their reserves for more attractive 
investments. But traders and analysts said the rally doesn't appear 
to be out of steam yet, and Friday's rise came on greatly increased 
trading volume over the lackluster levels of a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.K. auction certainly acted as a catalyst,'' said James  
Steel, an analyst for Refco Inc. in New York. ``There were a lot of 
producers and consumers represented, rather than speculative 
elements, which is very bullish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While not exactly embracing gold as in years past, investors may  
also be reacting to the slide in the U.S. stock market this month, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Platinum and palladium fell sharply in thin trading -- their  
declines blamed on a flight into gold. 
</P>
<P>
	October platinum fell $5.60 to $368.40 an ounce on the New York  
Merc; December palladium fell $5.55 to $358.40 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures rose on the Chicago Board of Trade due in large  
part to rumors that Egypt would be tendering an offer for wheat, as 
well as on news that Australian wheat imports had been banned by 
some Indonesian millers. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 4 1/2 cents to $2.77 3/4 a bushel.  
Other grains and soybeans also were mostly higher -- December corn 
rose 1/2 cent to $2.08 3/4 a bushel; December oats were unchanged at 
$1.13 1/4 a bushel; November soybeans rose 2 cents to $4.80 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, pork belly futures zoomed  
higher as traders tried to anticipate a quarterly report by the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture which came out after the market 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, deemed neutral for the market, put hog inventory at  
96 percent of last year, close to analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	February frozen pork bellies rose 3 cents to 62.42 cents a  
pound.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Mayor Freezes Museum's Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has frozen $7 million in  
city funding for one of the city's largest art museums over an 
exhibit that includes a dung-splattered painting of the Virgin Mary 
and pig halves in formaldehyde. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani described as ``sick'' the show scheduled to open Oct. 2  
at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, and said work that offends religious 
sensibilities doesn't deserve public money. 
</P>
<P>
	The city money amounts to nearly one-third of the museum's  
budget. 
</P>
<P>
	He also objected Thursday to the museum's plan to require  
children under 17 to be accompanied to the show by an adult, and 
one of his deputies suggested the museum buy its city-leased 
building if it doesn't like his position. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't approve closing down access to a museum that's paid  
for by the taxpayers,'' Giuliani said. ``What about the First 
Amendment rights of the children ... who aren't allowed to go in?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics said the mayor's position comes dangerously close to  
censorship. 
</P>
<P>
	The show, ``Sensation: Young British Artists From the Saatchi  
Collection,'' has been advertised for several weeks, and the city 
has several representatives on the museum's board. Asked why he 
waited to take action, Giuliani said he hadn't been made aware of 
the exhibit until recently. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit includes a painting of the Virgin Mary splattered  
with elephant dung, two pig halves floating in formaldehyde and a 
13-foot high rendering of a notorious British child killer. 
</P>
<P>
	Museum director Arnold Lehman said the items are meaningful.  
</P>
<P>
	``Contemporary art has always been provocative, it's been  
challenging,'' he said. ``That's what art of our time is about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He defended the decision to restrict children's entry.  
</P>
<P>
	``We think we're acting quite appropriately, giving parents the  
discretion to choose for their children,'' Lehman said.

<HEADLINE>  Sosa Taking Over M.J.'s Restaurant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- No one could upstage Michael Jordan on the  
basketball court. In the restaurant business, however, the retired 
superstar is being shoved aside by baseball's home run leader, 
Sammy Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
	In a move prompted by declining sales at Jordan's eatery --  
blamed partly on a rift between Jordan and the restaurant's owners 
-- Michael Jordan's Restaurant will become Sammy Sosa's Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	H. Gene Silverberg, a controlling partner in both ventures, said  
Jordan's eatery just north of downtown Chicago will be moved to a 
smaller, but higher-traffic location. He said sales at the 
restaurant have slipped about 20 percent in the last couple of 
years, although it remains profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to move Michael closer to traffic; he's an  
international brand,'' Silverberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the restaurant's initial popularity was ``due to the  
fact that we had seen six championships, several MVPs and (Jordan) 
came in very often.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But that has changed in recent years. Jordan apparently stopped  
eating at the restaurant after the owners rejected his ideas for 
making the restaurant more upscale. Silverberg said investors 
thought that would exclude many potential customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The switch is being made without Jordan's approval -- Silverberg  
said he doesn't need it. Jordan attorney Fred Sperling said the 
issue is not over, adding, ``Michael will respond in court, not 
through the media.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Jordan, Sosa will be required to make appearances.  
</P>
<P>
	And by all accounts, Slammin' Sammy is ready to play ball. He  
donned a chef's hat at a news conference Thursday to announce the 
restaurant and even swung a 4-foot-long red fork -- Sosa swinging a 
fork is the restaurant's logo. 
</P>
<P>
	``No way would (Jordan) put on that hat,'' Silverberg said.  
``Sammy is still playful ... and we need that to make this work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Sosa said he's going to consult with the chefs on  
the Spanish and American menu, and has no problem putting in 
appearances at the eatery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely (will be there); one reason I want to do this  
restaurant is to (thank) people from all over the world,'' said 
Sosa, who admits he can't cook. ``I've never had a restaurant 
before ... it's like a new car. People will see me there quite 
often.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa said he had nothing to do with the decision to move  
Jordan's restaurant, and called him ``my hero.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's still the man in my heart,'' Sosa said. ``I love  
Michael.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were other theories about why the restaurant -- a  
wall-to-wall shrine to Jordan that includes a gift shop -- declined 
in popularity. 
</P>
<P>
	Food critics said the cuisine, basic ``American comfort food,''  
was nothing to write home about -- or go back for. And the 
atmosphere was reminiscent of Planet Hollywood, another 
celebrity-heavy theme restaurant that fell on hard times, said 
Penny Pollack, dining editor at Chicago Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there is ever a reason to go back unless you had  
an out-of-town guest who really needed to go there,'' Pollack said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lunchtime customers had mixed opinions Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I love the Cubs and Sammy, but Michael's an icon in this  
city,'' said former Chicagoan Scott Neururer, 38, who was visiting 
from Los Angeles with his wife and baby. ``It's sad to see anything 
(related to) Michael go away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others said Jordan's absence definitely dampened business.  
</P>
<P>
	Johnny ``Red'' Kerr, the Bulls' first coach and a team announcer  
for the past 25 years, said people would have continued to crowd 
the restaurant if Jordan ate there. 
</P>
<P>
	``People packed the place when he was there,'' said Kerr, who  
also owned a Chicago restaurant for about five years. ``I don't 
think the Jordan mystique is gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Jordan's enormous popularity, Silverberg said Sosa and  
the Cubs might have more staying power, especially with Chicagoans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The difference is, the Cubs are forever in this town,''  
Silverberg said. ``They're sacred.''

<HEADLINE> No. 8 Virginia Tech 31, Clemson 11 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLACKSBURG, Va. (AP) -- Shyrone Stith, Ike Charlton and Corey  
Moore rescued No. 8 Virginia Tech from a great 57-minute show by 
Clemson quarterback Brandon Streeter on Thursday night, lifting the 
Hokies to a tense 31-11 victory over the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	Stith rushed for 162 yards and a touchdown, Charlton picked off  
Streeter's pass with 3:09 left and returned it 34 yards for a 
touchdown and Moore turned a sack and fumble by Streeter into a 
32-yard scoring play 38 seconds later for the Hokies (3-0). 
</P>
<P>
	Clemson (1-2) lost despite 27 completions in 43 attempts by  
Streeter, who had the Hokies' top-ranked defense on its heels until 
Charlton's game-turning TD. 
</P>
<P>
	The defensive scores were the first of the season for the  
Hokies, and gave them 34 touchdowns in 141 games since Frank Beamer 
became coach in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	The game marked the return of freshman sensation Michael Vick to  
the Hokies' lineup. Unlike the first game, when he was spectacular, 
Vick showed his inexperience by throwing three interceptions and 
trying to force the action. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hokies led 14-3, however, and appeared to have turned  
Streeter away again after forcing a fourth-and-4 from the Virginia 
Tech 9 with 11:31 to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemson lined up for a field goal, but placekicker Tony Lazarra  
instead took the snap and passed to running back Vince Ciurciu 
alone in the end zone. Streeter's 2-point conversion pass to Jason 
LeMay made it 14-11 with plenty of time left. 
</P>
<P>
	Stith, with 128 yards rushing by then, added 34 on seven  
carries, including a key third-down conversion at the Clemson 47, 
as Tech went on a 6 1/2-minute drive. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hokies drove 62 yards in 13 plays, finally settling for  
Shayne Graham's 47-yard field goal that made it 17-11 with five 
minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	From there, it was the defense's turn to finally get the best of  
Streeter.

<HEADLINE> Mass. Brings Back Jailhouse Stripes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW BEDFORD, Mass. (AP) -- A sheriff who has reintroduced chain  
gangs has also brought back old-fashioned black-and-white striped 
prison garb for teen-age inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason I chose that type of uniform is that kids today  
have a strong affinity with the clothes they wear and associate 
that with who they are,'' said Bristol County Sheriff Thomas 
Hodgson. ``If they make bad choices, they need to know they will 
lose that privilege.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dress code was implemented in July at a juvenile detention  
center in southeastern Massachusetts. So far, reaction among the 
young detainees has been exactly as Hodgson hoped. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't like them,'' he said. ``They're not a fashion  
statement in their world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some critics disagree with the sheriff's tactic.  
</P>
<P>
	``The striped uniforms are considered a joke in society, like  
Halloween costumes you can buy in a store,'' said attorney Greta 
Janusz, who specializes in prison litigation. ``Kids have a chance 
to be rehabilitated, and we should be concerned with their 
self-esteem. It's esteem problems that often lead to the crime 
itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hodgson, who was elected in November, gained notoriety earlier  
this year when he began offering crews of shackled prison inmates 
for community service projects. He also took away cigarettes, 
televisions and weight-lifting equipment privileges from some 
inmates.

	Indonesian Students Protest  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- The Indonesian government's suspension  
Friday of a new law giving the armed forces expanded emergency 
powers did not immediately quell running battles in Jakarta between 
student-led protesters and riot police backed by marines. The 
policy reversal -- one day after it was passed -- will further erode 
the prestige of President B.J. Habibie, who is running for 
re-election. During much of the day, demonstrators blocked the 
capital's main thoroughfare pelting police with stones and gasoline 
bombs. The national currency, the rupiah, continued to slide on 
fears of political instability and ended six percent lower than 
last week.

	Bush to Buchanan: Stay With GOP  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- GOP presidential front-runner George W. Bush  
today urged Pat Buchanan to remain a Republican and not bolt to a 
Reform Party presidential bid. Discussing a range of foreign policy 
issues in an interview with The Associated Press, Bush said he had 
the will to force United Nations weapons inspectors back into Iraq, 
and he sided with supporters of the troubled F-22 stealth fighter. 
On Buchanan, Bush said he disagreed with the conservative 
commentator's view that Nazi Germany wasn't a threat to the United 
States after 1940.

	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russian airstrikes around Chechnya's  
capital Friday sent thousands fleeing as the intensifying campaign 
heightened fears of another war in the breakaway republic. The 
bombings, which killed five people, followed attacks Thursday in 
which Russian planes pounded targets in and near Grozny in the 
first major raid on the city since a 1994-96 war between federal 
forces and Chechen separatists. The Russian government says it is 
trying to destroy Islamic militants based in Chechnya who twice 
invaded the neighboring Russian region of Dagestan since early

	Anti-Milosevic Protests Grow Slowly

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Demonstrations against Yugoslav  
President Slobodan Milosevic drew about 30,000 people in Belgrade 
on Friday, the biggest crowd so far in the latest round of 
protests. Milosevic's opponents hope to channel popular discontent 
with his autocratic rule into large demonstrations, like those that 
temporarily weakened his grip in late 1996 and early 1997. Some of 
those protests mobilized more than 100,000 people. One opposition 
leader, Democratic Party president Zoran Djindjic, said it was too 
early to conclude that the protests have failed. But, Djindjic 
said, ``if Milosevic is not shaken by November, we will have to 
concede that we didn't succeed.''

Keefe said he will withdraw as Frankel's lawyer because federal

Arafat today touted opportunities in the West Bank and Gaza and

<HEADLINE> Dancer Mignon Garland Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN PABLO, Calif. (AP) -- Mignon Garland, a dancer who carried on  
the legacy of Isadora Duncan in the United States, has died at the 
age of 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Garland, who died Sept. 15, was founder and director of the  
Isadora Duncan Heritage Society. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan helped pioneer modern dance by turning away from ballet  
and looking to ancient Greece for inspiration. She died in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Garland, born in Brooklyn, N.Y., decided to devote her life  
to dance that year after attending a performance by Duncan's 
disciples. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1930s and 40s, Ms. Garland toured with the Minneapolis  
Symphony, danced in Moscow and New York, founded several dance 
companies and was dance editor of New Theater magazine. Later, she 
lived for many years in the San Francisco home where Ms. Duncan was 
born. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Garland helped drive a Duncan revival that began with the  
1977 centenary of her birth. She also trained many Duncan dancers 
performing today, including her granddaughter, Amy Baird Garlin, 
and Lori Belilove. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Garland is survived by son Victor Garlin, a sister and two  
granddaughters.

<HEADLINE>  Sosa Taking Over M.J.'s Restaurant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- No one could upstage Michael Jordan on the  
basketball court. In the restaurant business, however, the retired 
superstar is being shoved aside by baseball's home run leader, 
Sammy Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
	In a move prompted by declining sales at Jordan's eatery --  
blamed partly on a rift between Jordan and the restaurant's owners 
-- Michael Jordan's Restaurant will become Sammy Sosa's Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	H. Gene Silverberg, a controlling partner in both ventures, said  
Jordan's eatery just north of downtown Chicago will be moved to a 
smaller, but higher-traffic location. He said sales at the 
restaurant have slipped about 20 percent in the last couple of 
years, although it remains profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to move Michael closer to traffic; he's an  
international brand,'' Silverberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the restaurant's initial popularity was ``due to the  
fact that we had seen six championships, several MVPs and (Jordan) 
came in very often.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But that has changed in recent years. Jordan apparently stopped  
eating at the restaurant after the owners rejected his ideas for 
making the restaurant more upscale. Silverberg said investors 
thought that would exclude many potential customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The switch is being made without Jordan's approval -- Silverberg  
said he doesn't need it. Jordan attorney Fred Sperling said the 
issue is not over, adding, ``Michael will respond in court, not 
through the media.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Jordan, Sosa will be required to make appearances.  
</P>
<P>
	And by all accounts, Slammin' Sammy is ready to play ball. He  
donned a chef's hat at a news conference Thursday to announce the 
restaurant and even swung a 4-foot-long red fork -- Sosa swinging a 
fork is the restaurant's logo. 
</P>
<P>
	``No way would (Jordan) put on that hat,'' Silverberg said.  
``Sammy is still playful ... and we need that to make this work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Sosa said he's going to consult with the chefs on  
the Spanish and American menu, and has no problem putting in 
appearances at the eatery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely (will be there); one reason I want to do this  
restaurant is to (thank) people from all over the world,'' said 
Sosa, who admits he can't cook. ``I've never had a restaurant 
before ... it's like a new car. People will see me there quite 
often.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa said he had nothing to do with the decision to move  
Jordan's restaurant, and called him ``my hero.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's still the man in my heart,'' Sosa said. ``I love  
Michael.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were other theories about why the restaurant -- a  
wall-to-wall shrine to Jordan that includes a gift shop -- declined 
in popularity. 
</P>
<P>
	Food critics said the cuisine, basic ``American comfort food,''  
was nothing to write home about -- or go back for. And the 
atmosphere was reminiscent of Planet Hollywood, another 
celebrity-heavy theme restaurant that fell on hard times, said 
Penny Pollack, dining editor at Chicago Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there is ever a reason to go back unless you had  
an out-of-town guest who really needed to go there,'' Pollack said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lunchtime customers had mixed opinions Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I love the Cubs and Sammy, but Michael's an icon in this  
city,'' said former Chicagoan Scott Neururer, 38, who was visiting 
from Los Angeles with his wife and baby. ``It's sad to see anything 
(related to) Michael go away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others said Jordan's absence definitely dampened business.  
</P>
<P>
	Johnny ``Red'' Kerr, the Bulls' first coach and a team announcer  
for the past 25 years, said people would have continued to crowd 
the restaurant if Jordan ate there. 
</P>
<P>
	``People packed the place when he was there,'' said Kerr, who  
also owned a Chicago restaurant for about five years. ``I don't 
think the Jordan mystique is gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Jordan's enormous popularity, Silverberg said Sosa and  
the Cubs might have more staying power, especially with Chicagoans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The difference is, the Cubs are forever in this town,''  
Silverberg said. ``They're sacred.''

<HEADLINE> Rooney Explains Column </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Andy Rooney has taken steps to clear up a little  
wreck of his own. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``60 Minutes'' curmudgeon set tongues wagging with a  
newspaper column this week that suggested that the most beautiful 
woman in TV news ``looks as if she had been in a minor automobile 
accident'' because of plastic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't name any names. That's because, Rooney said Thursday,  
he wasn't talking about anybody. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was writing metaphorically,'' he said. ``I didn't have  
anybody really in mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his column about aging, Rooney said that most people are more  
attractive if they look their age instead of synthetically trying 
to improve their appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	That's something many people in his business can't accept, he  
noted. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the most beautiful -- OK, THE most beautiful -- woman in  
television news had a job done on herself a few years ago and, 
while she doesn't look bad, she does not look the same or as good 
to me as when she had what must have seemed to her to be 
shortcomings,'' he wrote. ``She looks as if she had been in a minor 
automobile accident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gossip columnists -- and undoubtedly a few of Rooney's female  
colleagues -- immediately began the guessing game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suppose there must be 20 women in television who thought I  
was talking about them,'' Rooney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some speculated Rooney meant Diane Sawyer, his former colleague  
on ``60 Minutes.'' Not so fast, the New York Post's Page Six opined 
on Thursday, tossing the names Barbara Walters, Christiane 
Amanpour, Maria Shriver, Jane Pauley, Lesley Stahl and Connie Chung 
into the mix. 
</P>
<P>
	Yikes!  
</P>
<P>
	With so many women to potentially offend, Rooney put a stop to  
it. He said he regretted writing it: ``I didn't mean to call this 
much attention to myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he offered a verbal bouquet to Ms. Sawyer.  
</P>
<P>
	``Diane is a good friend of mine and I like her a lot,'' he  
said. ``I think she's not only one of the great people in 
television but she's one of the good people, too. She's as smart as 
she is beautiful.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Ryder Cup Team Wants Cheers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- Momentum means everything in the Ryder  
Cup matches. The reaction of approximately 35,000 spectators who 
line the fairways today at The Country Club will indicate which 
team is on its way to winning the cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis Love III, a member of the last four U.S. teams, drew a  
logical conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	``If things get quiet, we're going to be in trouble,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Unlike most golf tournaments, the crowd plays a big part in the  
Ryder Cup, where national pride can be at stake outside the ropes 
just as much as it is inside. 
</P>
<P>
	The roaring throngs can't make putts or hit long drives, but  
they can help change the momentum of the matches. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's all the crowds out there that are just going bananas  
for one team or another, and you feel their desire and you feel the 
desire of your teammates,'' Tom Lehman said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton is expected to be part of that crowd Sunday,  
and the king and queen of Spain will be on hand to cheer for the 
Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
	The noises that roll across the hilly fairways of The Country  
Club will be so unmistakable that players won't need a scoreboard 
to figure out what is going on. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's going to be cheers for the Europeans, but the cheers  
for the Americans are going to be a lot louder,'' Payne Stewart 
said. ``So, if you're playing in a match and you hear a big cheer 
behind you, you're going to know who it's for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justin Leonard found that out at Valderrama where he hit a poor  
shot on the first tee, and heard the crowd cheer. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's something you don't hear too much on a golf course,''  
Leonard said. ``It can be intimidating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Europeans discovered that in 1991 at Kiawah Island, S.C.,  
where boisterous fans chanted ``USA, USA'' and acted so badly that 
even some of the American players were embarrassed. 
</P>
<P>
	Scotland's Colin Montgomerie, a Ryder Cup rookie that year,  
might have had that in mind at the U.S. Open last year, when fans 
heckled him briefly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Save it for the Ryder Cup,'' Montgomerie said.  
</P>
<P>
	Montgomerie is a player Americans love to hate, though he played  
the 1995 Ryder Cup at Oak Hill in Rochester, N.Y., without problems 
and expects the same this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't foresee any problems this week,'' Montgomerie said.  
</P>
<P>
	Teammate Darren Clarke agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``What hostile crowd?'' Clarke said. ``Who said the crowd was  
going to be hostile?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Europeans might want to heed the words of 1997 team member  
Scott Hoch, who was paired with Jeff Maggert against Nick Faldo and 
Lee Westwood at Valderrama. 
</P>
<P>
	On the first tee, the crowd was cheering the European team and  
heckling the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `You guys aren't used to this, but I'm used to people  
rooting against me every week on the PGA Tour,' '' Maggert said. 
``It took the nerves out of the day and we had a great day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Tiger Woods, having a home crowd is long overdue.  
</P>
<P>
	Woods played on his first Ryder Cup team in Spain, and has  
played the Presidents Cup in Australia, the Eisenhower Cup in 
France and the Walker Cup in Wales. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to have some fans cheering for us for some good  
shots,'' Woods said. ``I don't have to hear boos all day.''

<HEADLINE> Ripken Has Season of Ups and Downs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Cal Ripken proved this season he can still hit  
for average and with power. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iron Man also showed he is a mere mortal, burdened by a back  
injury that required surgery and the emotional blow of his father's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken's most trying season came to a sudden, early end  
Thursday. The 39-year-old third baseman closed the year just nine 
hits short of 3,000 for his career, a milestone he should reach in 
April if his rehabilitation proceeds as expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can carve this in granite: If anyone can come back from a  
back operation without losing a step, it's Cal Ripken,'' Dr. Bill 
Howard, director of sports medicine at Baltimore's Union Memorial 
Hospital, said Thursday. ``He's got the strength, the conditioning 
and the mindset to make it happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, it was hard to imagine Ripken missing a game, let  
alone a week. Or a month. The most durable player in the history of 
the sport played 2,632 consecutive games before voluntarily ending 
the run in the Orioles' final home date of the 1998 season. 
</P>
<P>
	This year was decidedly different. Ripken twice spent time on  
the disabled list for the first time since his career began in 
1981. He missed three weeks with lower back pain beginning April 20 
and sat out the entire month of August after the back spasms 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	He finally decided this week surgery was the only option, and he  
had an operation Thursday in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgery completed a season that began with the loss of his  
father, Cal Sr., who died of lung cancer in March. The emotional 
and physical pain diminished a year in which he hit his 400th 
career homer and compiled a .340 average, 64 points above the .276 
lifetime mark he carried into the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to meet a lot of professional and personal challenges,''  
Ripken said last week. ``When you look back, will it be a season to 
remember? I guess in some ways it would be, but for the most part, 
it represents something of a loss as well as something of a gain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gain? Ripken found a batting stance that let him either pull  
the ball or drive it to the opposite field. He got a career-high 
six hits in one game and his 18 homers were more than he had in 
four of his previous five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ironically, in my opinion, his back forced him to have a  
conservative stance for the first time in years,'' teammate Mike 
Mussina said. 
</P>
<P>
	An interesting theory, Ripken says.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think when I first started coming back and swinging the bat  
I was tentative because I didn't know what effect there was on the 
back. I started to get a pretty good feel in the batting cage and I 
developed it from there, so maybe you could say the back injury did 
have something to do with it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The back injury had everything to do with the fact that he  
played in only 86 games, a far cry from his steady 162. 
</P>
<P>
	And even when he was on the field, he couldn't shake the  
memories of his father, a former coach and manager with the Orioles 
who was by far the most notable influence in Ripken's stellar 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``The injuries that I've never had to deal with professionally  
and the loss of my father personally -- that affects everything I 
do, my focus, the ability to concentrate,'' Ripken said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all go through different issues and it all impacts on your  
work or your ability to function in life. I just happened to get a 
double dose of them at the same time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Personally and professionally, it was a hard dose of reality for  
a seemingly invulnerable sports hero. 
</P>
<P>
	``You live and learn,'' he said, ``and you deal with it as best  
you can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He dealt with it well in 1999.  
</P>
<P>
	``Cal certainly has been through a lot this year,'' Orioles  
shortstop Mike Bordick said. ``And then to have the season he's 
having ... well, what else can you call it but Ripkenesque?''

<HEADLINE> J. Bush Pushes Vouchers to Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Giving parents vouchers for private schools  
doesn't mean abandoning public education, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush 
told congressional leaders interested in replicating his state's 
program at the federal level. 
</P>
<P>
	``There should be zero tolerance for failure,'' said Bush, whose  
state is the first to give parents money that can be used for 
private and parochial schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents whose children are in low-performing schools must be  
given options, but those schools must not be neglected, Bush told 
the House Budget Committee on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Though similar proposals died in the Senate, a majority in the  
House has always been willing to consider the idea of federal 
public funds for private schooling. Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, who 
chairs the budget panel, said plans like Florida's ``are able to 
rescue the public education system, by giving a failing school the 
resources -- and time -- necessary to right itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the state law Bush signed in June, schools are graded on  
an A-to-F scale based mostly on students' state test results in 
reading, math and writing. Students in schools graded F for two out 
of every four years could go to private school with the tax dollars 
that would otherwise go to the public school. The amount could 
range from $3,000 to up to $25,000 for a child with special needs 
such as one with a physical disability. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, 78 schools with 61,000 students, got Fs. But just two  
schools were chosen for the voucher plan. Bush said that the 134 
children who used the vouchers had a range of abilities, which he 
said debunks the theory that vouchers take the best students from 
public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reaction to our plan has been fun to watch,'' said Bush,  
adding that failing schools get funds for after-school programs, 
class-size reduction and extended-year schooling. ``You have 
dramatic reform in schools where children have not been learning as 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Education Secretary Richard Riley strongly criticized the idea.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's the belief that all you have to do to fix public  
schools is to leave them behind and subsidize private education 
instead, that there is some kind of parallel universe of superior 
private schools ready to take on the job of educating 46 million 
public school students,'' Riley said in his testimony. ``Well, I'm 
here to tell you that there is no such parallel universe. The only 
way to fix the public schools is to fix the public schools, not to 
abandon them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Rush Holt, a New Jersey Democrat, criticized Republican  
funding of education: ``The House leadership has had a rhetorical 
support of education, but there has been little in the way of 
actual support. You need only look at this year's flat funding for 
the education budget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's brother Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the GOP presidential  
hopeful, has proposed giving federal money for poor children to 
their parents. Parents unsatisfied with their schools could use the 
money for tutoring or toward a public or private education. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeb Bush defended Florida's plan, noting he also gives those  
schools that get an A grade incentives up to $100 per student to 
spend as they see fit. Some education and civic groups have charged 
the plan violates church-state separation laws and takes needed 
public funds from public schools. A pending lawsuit by the NAACP 
and the state teachers' union is aimed at eliminating the program.

<HEADLINE> Burn 1, Revolution 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Oscar Pareja scored in the 70th minute  
Friday night to give the Dallas Burn a 1-0 victory over the New 
England Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	The Revolution have won only twice since the All-Star break and  
remain one point behind Miami for the final Eastern Conference 
playoff berth. Dallas has already clinched a playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Revolution (11-20) had the better of the chances, but Dallas  
(17-13) made the most of its scant opportunities, aided by some 
shoddy defending by New England. 
</P>
<P>
	Pareja got his fourth goal of the year after Mark Santel's cross  
from the left corner was headed to him by Jason Kreis, who was left 
unmarked by John Harkes. Pareja slotted the ball home from 10 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas goalkeeper Matt Jordan had consecutive stops of a header  
by Giovanni Savarese and a spinning kick by Johnny Torres in the 
final minute. 
</P>
<P>
	New England had two chances in the early going. In the ninth  
minute, Joe-Max Moore took a cross by Ted Chronopoulos and struck a 
powerful shot from 5 yards only to be denied by Jordan. Three 
minutes later, Harkes floated a cross to Savarese, who headed wide 
of the left post. At 16 minutes, Harkes put Moore into the Dallas 
area, where he was again foiled by Jordan -- this time from 6 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight minutes into the second half, Ariel Graziani put Pareja  
through on the right side where he knocked a high shot from 15 
yards that goalkeeper Jeff Causey palmed away. The rebound came to 
Santel 17 yards out on the left side, but the Dallas midfielder 
shot right at Causey.

<HEADLINE> Senator's Aide Makes Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- The former chief of staff for Sen. Max  
Baucus lodged a sexual harassment complaint against him Friday, 
claiming the Democrat made advances toward her and tried to coerce 
her into dropping her accusations. 
</P>
<P>
	In seeking redress through a congressional employee grievance  
process, Christine Niedermeier said Baucus promised her two months 
of severance pay if she backed off. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement issued Thursday, Baucus reiterated his denial  
that he sexually harassed Niedermeier, and repeated that he fired 
her last month because she had abused his staff and constituents 
with her harsh management style. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look forward to moving this matter to a forum where I will  
be fully vindicated,'' he said. He would not agree to an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Niedermeier, 47 and single, has claimed Baucus, 57 and married,  
made sexual advances from the time she joined his staff in May 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	She made her complaint to the Office of Compliance, a  
legislative agency created in 1995 after the sexual harassment 
scandal of former Sen. Bob Packwood of Oregon. The system first 
turns to counseling and mediation, and if unsuccessful moves to a 
private hearing before a federal judge, or to federal civil courts. 
</P>
<P>
	In her complaint, she said Baucus ``on many occasions engaged in  
conduct in the office that can best be termed abusive, 
temperamental and inappropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baucus constantly questioned her about her personal life and  
dating habits, suggested they go away for a weekend together and 
indicated he wanted more than an employer-employee relationship, 
she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``On many occasions, I let him know that his actions made me  
feel uncomfortable and was unwanted,'' she wrote. ``On some 
occasions I directly asked him to stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said he fired her shortly after one such confrontation July  
31. 
</P>
<P>
	Baucus' lawyer, Jean Manning, called Niedermeier's charge a  
fabrication. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is exactly where we wanted the case -- in a forum where  
she has to testify under oath and we'll deal with facts before a 
judge now,'' Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint accuses Baucus of harassment, gender  
discrimination and retaliation. She wants past and future lost 
wages and benefits, and punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she may also take legal action for breach of contract,  
defamation, extortion and theft.

<HEADLINE> Ray Is the Hunter at Vegas.com 500 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Greg Ray is used to being the hunted, not the  
hunter. But the Indy Racing League points leader found himself 
chasing Sam Schmidt in Friday's practice for the Vegas.com 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmidt was the fastest driver in both the sessions at the Las  
Vegas Motor Speedway. In his Sprint PCS car with a G Force chassis, 
the Las Vegas resident turned a fast lap of 208.849 mph in the 
morning and went 207.876 mph later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely great to be on the top of the pole, but really  
all that matters is Sunday,'' said Schmidt, who finished a 
career-best second here last year. ``At the same time, if you can 
practice your race setup and be at the front of the pack, it just 
tells you everything is working.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ray, winner of three of the last four IRL events, including the  
last two, had the day's second-best speed at 208.631 mph in the 
morning session. He struggled in the afternoon, going 206.889 mph 
in his Glidden-Menards with a Dallara chassis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wasn't confident in the car,'' he said. ``A lot of  
times I drive the car hard when it's not perfect. I don't feel like 
doing that this weekend. I would rather the car be perfect if I'm 
going to commit to it like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ray leads the IRL points standings with 246, 44 ahead of Scott  
Goodyear and 47 ahead of Kenny Brack. Ray needs to increase his 
lead to 56 points or more after Sunday's race to clinch his first 
IRL championship and a $1 million bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray could tie an IRL record for consecutive victories set last  
year by Brack with a victory Sunday. His fourth win of the season 
would be an IRL record. 
</P>
<P>
	Brack went slightly faster in the afternoon (205.950 mph) than  
the morning (205.097) as he adjusts from a Dallara to a G Force 
chassis in his A.J. Foyt-owned car. Foyt made the decision to 
switch after testing the G Force in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very smooth and predictable right now,'' he said. ``We  
haven't raced it yet, so we don't know for sure, but it's very 
consistent and stable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The track temperature rose from 104 degrees in the morning to  
129 degrees by the afternoon. Handling on the 1.5-mile oval can be 
tricky, with the heat and wind often combining for slippery 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmidt, who has four top-10 finishes in his last five races,  
noticed a difference in practice sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fortunately, we were pretty close in both situations,'' he  
said. ``I don't think the heat affected it as much as the increase 
in wind. There really wasn't a whole lot of wind in the morning, 
very minimal. Then we started getting some in our (afternoon) 
session.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stephan Gregoire had the day's third-quickest practice speed of  
207.333. Mark Dismore went 206.572 mph and Buddy Lazier was fifth 
at 206.256 mph. Lazier increased his speed from 204.043 mph in the 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel good to have made such a gain,'' Lazier said. ``This  
racetrack is very challenging from a grip point of view. It has to 
do with the atmosphere here in the desert and the banking of the 
track. It's like driving 200 mph on snow and ice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Ray's lead, Schmidt and 10 others aren't exactly out of  
the points race. From Goodyear in second to Schmidt in 12th, 11 
drivers are separated by just 30 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear has slumped recently, finishing out of the top 10 in  
his last four races. His last victory was in the Longhorn 500 on 
June 12 at Texas Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to stick to our plan, which is to just go out and  
win, and that's our only focus right now,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Indonesia Ends Controversial Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesia's government caved in to  
massive public protests today and suspended the implementation of a 
controversial law that would have given the military power to curb 
civil liberties. 
</P>
<P>
	The passage of the law by Indonesia's outgoing parliament on  
Thursday sparked protests across Indonesia. In Jakarta, four people 
were reported killed and 115 injured in violence between 
demonstrators and heavily armed riot police. 
</P>
<P>
	``Half of people do not understand the contents of the bill,''  
military spokesman Maj. Gen. Sudrajat said in announcing the 
Cabinet decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of that, the government has decided to suspend the  
security law,'' said Sudrajat, who like many Indonesians uses only 
one name. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the announcement, violent protests had gripped Jakarta  
for a second day as riot police firing rubber bullets struggled to 
contain crowds of demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
	An official from Jakarta's Ciptomangunkusumo Hospital said the  
bodies of three protesters had been brought in since late Thursday. 
All had been shot by plastic bullets or live rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	A police officer died in a traffic accident, authorities said.  
</P>
<P>
	About 500 riot police stormed the Atma Jaya Catholic University  
before dawn, firing volleys of tear gas and rubber bullets at 
students who had taken over the campus. 
</P>
<P>
	By early afternoon, the clashes were moving slowly down  
Jakarta's main boulevard, Sudirman Avenue, toward the center of the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	Many feared the controversial new law could allow the armed  
forces to use the crisis in the territory of East Timor and other 
outbreaks of unrest to gradually seize control of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking on national television today, Sudrajat said the  
legislation was more democratic than the existing law. 
</P>
<P>
	However, ``it will not be implemented until it is clear that the  
people understand the contents and the purpose of this bill,'' 
Sudrajat said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shops and banks in the area of the university closed early and  
sent their employees home at lunch time because of the violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the campus, police smashed the windows of buildings and  
cars and arrested five students. Overall, 42 people were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are not police, they are pirates and murderers,'' said  
business student Alex Leonardo, 25. 
</P>
<P>
	The university was the focus of massive pro-democracy protests  
last year that led to the ouster of then-President Suharto, the 
military strongman who ruled the country for 32 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Indonesians believe the armed forces, which underpinned  
Suharto's dictatorship, are trying to reassert their political 
clout in the wake of the country's first free elections in four 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``The military will take advantage of the new bill, that is for  
sure,'' said Amien Rais, a prominent Muslim politician and a member 
of the new parliament that is to be sworn in on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``The role of the armed forces will be increased and the  
democratic process could be blocked,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The protests swept the nation Thursday after the outgoing  
assembly, dominated by Suharto loyalists, rubber-stamped the 
hastily introduced measure allowing the military to revoke civil 
liberties in ``emergency situations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In today's protests, youths from Jakarta's working class  
districts joined the fray. Several hundred protesters continued to 
taunt police who fired volley after volley of rubber bullets and 
tear gas to keep them at bay. 
</P>
<P>
	The clashes closed the main thoroughfare during morning rush  
hour today, forcing tens of thousands of people to walk to work. 
Many of the commuters were coughing and holding handkerchiefs to 
their faces as they walked through clouds of tear gas.

<HEADLINE> Nielsen Expected To Be Funny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- After making people laugh in slapstick  
movies like ``The Naked Gun'' series, Leslie Nielsen is finding it 
hard to for some people to take him seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	The 73-year-old actor is scheduled to appear here tonight in the  
one-man play ``Clarence Darrow,'' about the legendary defense 
attorney. He said in a previous performance, some audience members 
giggled inexplicably. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were laughing in crazy places. I realized it had to be  
because they expected me to be funny,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The play covers Darrow's famous defense in 1925 of Tennessee  
science teacher John Scopes, who was convicted of violating a state 
law making it a crime to teach evolution. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had this incredible ability to speak on any subject,''  
Nielsen said of Darrow. ``Usually in debates he would take the con 
side of the debate. He enjoyed facing, as he said, 500 to 1,000 
people who were waiting for him to fall on his face.''

<HEADLINE> Gov't Sees No Threat in Copper Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Phelps Dodge has yet to persuade Cyprus Amax  
Minerals Co. and Asarco Inc. to accept its hostile takeover bid, 
but the Justice Department sees no threat to competition if the 
three copper makers become one. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal agency's antitrust division agreed to cut short the  
waiting period during which the government could challenge or 
subject the deal to further review, spokeswoman Jennifer Rose said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision amounts to a tacit approval of the proposed deal,  
which would merge three of the nation's four largest copper 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Phelps Dodge sweetened its offer to buy the two  
companies, which have already spurned two bids and agreed to push 
ahead their own merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Stockholders for Cyprus Amax, based in Englewood, Colo., and  
Asarco, based in New York, are scheduled to vote on their two-way 
deal on Sept. 30.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A woman driving out of a midtown Manhattan  
parking garage lost control of her car and smashed through the 
front of a restaurant, killing one person and injuring more than 20 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were sprawled all over,'' said firefighter Brian  
Kearney. ``It was unbelievable -- it's the worst I've ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mercedes-Benz driven by Marcia Feltingoff, 51, of West New  
York, N.J., accelerated suddenly Thursday evening and plowed 
through Arno, striking patrons before coming to a rest against the 
restaurant's rear wall, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She came through the barrier ... then, like out of a movie,  
went through the front of the restaurant,'' said witness Mike 
McCormack. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear what caused the accident and there were no  
immediate arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	Cirel Trucl, 62, of New Jersey, was pronounced dead after  
suffering a heart attack and head wounds. Seventeen of the injured 
patrons were transported to hospitals for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Feltingoff also suffered minor injuries.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Boss Gets His Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Juergen Schrempp caused a lot of queasiness in  
Germany when he took over as chairman of Daimler-Benz in 1995, 
announcing harsh U.S.-style cuts to restore Germany's biggest 
industrial concern to profitability after a year of record losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Now at the top of an even bigger DaimlerChrysler, Schrempp is  
shaking things up again. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's announced departure of Chrysler division president  
Thomas Stallkamp -- an outspoken American and Schrempp critic who 
was considered a possible successor for the top job -- was 
interpreted as a move toward consolidation of power on the German 
side of the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not the first time Schrempp, 55, described as both  
charismatic and ruthless, has been seen as edging out rivals with 
differing views. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, then-Mercedes-Benz chairman Helmut Werner resigned  
rather than see his power eroded in Schrempp's plan to merge the 
luxury car and truck manufacturer back into its parent company, 
Daimler-Benz. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan gave Schrempp, who beat out Werner to take over Daimler  
in 1995, more direct control over Mercedes. Werner -- whom Business 
Week included on its 1996 list of the 25 most successful top 
managers -- had opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
	Following last year's merger, seven top Chrysler executives  
jumped ship, provoking reports of a culture clash at the 
trans-Atlantic automaker. Schrempp has bristled at hints of 
problems, though. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is the big deal of seven people ... having left? ... No  
deal whatsoever, happens all the time and will continue to 
happen,'' he told reporters in a conference call in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Schrempp, who began his career more than 30 years ago as a  
mechanic trainee for Mercedes cars, has worked overseas himself, 
including 11 years in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1982-84 he headed Cleveland-based Euclid, Inc., a Daimler  
subsidiary that produced heavy-duty trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	He was chairman of the board of Daimler-Benz's aerospace  
division when he was tapped to take over the whole company in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Reversing years of untethered expansion under his predecessor,  
Schrempp began slashing away at money-losing divisions that had 
contributed to a record loss of $3.2 billion in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the first German converts to the U.S. philosophy of  
stressing shareholder value, he trimmed the work force by some 10 
percent, ignoring union protests. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Schrempp showed little respect for German traditions of  
labor-management consensus when he made Daimler the first company 
to apply a new law allowing a cut in sick pay. He retreated when 
angry workers walked off their jobs, but his overall efforts 
restored the company to profitability that year. 
</P>
<P>
	Long viewed with suspicion by play-it-safe German business  
circles, the turnaround earned Schrempp respect -- which only grew 
after he pulled off the Chrysler merger coup.

<HEADLINE> Ovarian Implant Called Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Young women left infertile due to cancer or  
other ailments may someday have children thanks to an experimental 
ovarian tissue transplant that a doctor says restored a menopausal 
woman's menstrual cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case indicates that we are on the cusp of safe, reliable  
transplantation of human ovarian tissue,'' said Larry Lipshultz, 
president of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	``This should give great hope to women suffering from ovarian  
and other cancers and may lead to successful treatment for other 
causes of infertility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Kutluk Oktay performed the operation in February on Margaret  
Lloyd-Hart in the hopes of reversing symptoms of menopause brought 
on by the removal of her ovaries. Her first ovary was removed when 
she was 17 because of a cyst. The second was removed two years ago 
for a medical condition described only as benign. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lloyd-Hart, a 30-year-old dancer from Tucson, Ariz., had  
some ovarian tissue from the second operation preserved through 
freezing six months before the implant at New York Methodist 
Hospital. The preserved tissue contained unfertilized eggs. 
</P>
<P>
	Four months after the implant, Oktay gave Ms. Lloyd-Hart  
fertility drugs to test ovarian function. She ovulated and had a 
normal menstrual period, Oktay said. Ms. Lloyd-Hart, who is on 
hormone replacement therapy and now lives in London, won't know 
until her next examination in New York in a couple of months 
whether she is continuing to ovulate, Oktay said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of her condition, there is no way for her to know with  
certainty whether an egg is being released without an examination 
by a specialist. 
</P>
<P>
	Oktay, who will be presenting his work next week at a meeting of  
the American Society for Reproductive Medicine in Toronto, said 
Thursday the surgery gives new hope for young infertile women, 
especially women who had cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's probably the best news they can have,'' Oktay said.  
``After they hear they have cancer, there is someone telling them 
they may have hope for the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He and other experts say the procedure is not recommended as a  
means for women to delay child-bearing into what would normally be 
menopausal years. 
</P>
<P>
	Ian Craft of the London Fertility Centre noted that women  
already in menopause would not benefit because ``they have no eggs 
left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American Cancer Society estimates that 25,200 women will be  
diagnosed with ovarian cancer this year. In addition to damage from 
the disease, women can suffer ovarian damage from treatments such 
as chemotherapy. If the new procedure proves successful, such women 
could potentially have their ovaries removed, be treated for cancer 
and then have the ovaries re-implanted.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Court Upholds Electric Chair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Two months after a horrific state  
execution that sent blood spurting down the condemned man's chest, 
the Florida Supreme Court ruled Friday that the electric chair is 
not cruel or unusual punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third time the court has upheld the state's use of  
electrocution this decade. It issued similar rulings after flames 
shot from the chair's headpiece during executions in 1990 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``The record in this case reveals abundant evidence that  
execution by electrocution renders an inmate instantaneously 
unconscious, thereby making it impossible to feel pain,'' the court 
wrote in its 4-3 decision Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Chief Justice Major Harding urged lawmakers to consider  
offering condemned killers an alternative method of execution, such 
as lethal injection. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 38 states with capital punishment, only Florida, Georgia,  
Alabama and Nebraska use the electric chair as their sole execution 
method. 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge to Florida's use of the electric chair was brought  
by death row inmate Thomas Provenzano, who was scheduled to die in 
the electric chair Friday for the 1984 murder of an Orlando court 
bailiff. Provenzano's execution was delayed for a second hearing on 
his sanity. 
</P>
<P>
	The focus of his challenge was the bloody execution in July of  
Allen Lee ``Tiny'' Davis. Doctors determined that the blood seen 
flowing from Davis' collar and down his chest during the execution 
came from a nosebleed, but the descriptions from witnesses drew 
wide public criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyer Martin McClain, who argued the case for Provenzano, said  
there was ``good reason'' to appeal the court's decision to uphold 
electrocution to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't going away,'' McClain said. ``It is going to come  
up again, perhaps in every execution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a dissenting opinion Friday, Florida Supreme Court Justice  
Leander Shaw wrote: ``The color photos of Davis depict a man who -- 
for all appearances -- was brutally tortured to death. 
</P>
<P>
	``Violence begets violence, and each of these deaths was a  
barbaric spectacle played by the state of Florida on the world 
stage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jeb Bush called the court ruling a ``resounding victory for  
all Floridians, especially those who have been victimized by the 
cruel and malicious acts of those inmates on death row.''

<HEADLINE> Owner of Mich. Dailies Seeks Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOUNT CLEMENS, Mich. (AP) -- 21st Century Newspapers Inc., the  
company that owns daily newspapers in Pontiac, Mount Clemens and 
Royal Oak, is looking for a potential merger partner or buyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Employees at The Oakland Press in Pontiac, The Macomb Daily in  
Mount Clemens and The Daily Tribune in Royal Oak were told Thursday 
that owner Frank H. Shepherd has retained Goldman, Sachs and Co. to 
help with a merger or sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepherd plans to retire to be with his family once the  
transaction is completed. 
</P>
<P>
	21st Century also owns weekly newspapers and the Greater Detroit  
Newspaper Network, an advertising sales group based in Royal Oak, 
Mich. Shepherd formed the company in 1995 and bought the three 
dailies in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepherd, who has more than 35 years experience in the  
publishing industry, mostly in Michigan. He began his career at The 
Times Herald Co. in Port Huron and eventually became general 
manager of The Daily Sentinel in Utica. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepherd joined Panax Corp. in East Lansing in 1968 and became  
chief operating officer, running seven daily newspapers. When Panax 
was sold in 1981, Shepherd bought a publishing company in Houston, 
Texas, then joined the Scripps Howard group in 1984, where he was 
vice president of newspaper operations. 
</P>
<P>
	He also served as president and CEO of Stauffer Communications  
Inc. of Topeka, Kan., until it was sold. Stauffer owned 23 dailies, 
including two in Michigan, 13 broadcast outlets and several 
magazines.

<HEADLINE> Financier May Need Public Defender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Authorities say rogue financier Martin  
Frankel masterminded one of the largest insurance scams in U.S. 
history, but now he doesn't even have enough money to pay his legal 
bills, according to his lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	New Haven defense attorney Hugh Keefe said Friday he will  
withdraw as Frankel's lawyer because federal officials have frozen 
all of Frankel's assets and rejected requests to release a portion 
of the funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you were to believe the government, he's allegedly one of  
the great white-collar criminals of our time, but if he is, he 
certainly doesn't have any funds to hire a private lawyer,'' Keefe 
told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can't very well mount a defense unless he gets some of the  
money they seized from him,'' Keefe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Keefe said the money was needed both to pay his bill and hire  
experts to work for the defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Delcie Thibault, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in  
Connecticut, declined to say how much the government had seized or 
comment on Keefe's claims. A message was left seeking comment from 
a spokeswoman for the FBI in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel, a 44-year-old money manager from Greenwich, fled the  
United States in May after allegedly bilking insurance companies in 
five states out of hundreds of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	When Frankel was arrested in a hotel room in Hamburg, Germany,  
on Sept. 4, authorities seized more than $1 million in cash and 
diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, the FBI seized one of the two mansions Frankel kept in  
Greenwich. The IRS seized the second estate earlier this month, 
alleging it was bought with money from a Swiss bank account into 
which Frankel had deposited $44 million he stole from the insurance 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	State regulators have seized $57.5 million and were seeking  
another $26.5 million in a frozen Swiss bank account linked to 
Frankel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, we're working with other states toward whatever  
other asset recovery will be possible,'' said Marilyn Elam, a 
spokeswoman for the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Keefe said defending Frankel will require an array of  
high-priced experts, including forensic accountants to help 
decipher the wildly varying estimates of the loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators say Frankel's unlicensed brokerage siphoned at least  
$218 million from insurers in Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, 
Oklahoma and Tennessee. A lawsuit filed by some of the companies 
puts the loss much higher, at $915 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators originally thought Frankel may have stolen as much  
as $1.98 billion from the St. Francis of Assisi Foundation, a bogus 
charity Frankel established last year in the British Virgin 
Islands. But it's now unclear whether much -- if any -- of that money 
ever existed. 
</P>
<P>
	Keefe said he has notified the federal public defender's office  
in Connecticut that they may have to appoint someone to defend 
Frankel. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas G. Dennis, chief federal public defender, could not be  
reached for comment Friday. Two messages were left at his Hartford 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Keefe said he has been unable to speak to Frankel since he was  
arrested because officials at the Hamburg prison where Frankel is 
being held will not allow Frankel to use the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he will remain as Frankel's lawyer for several more days  
as he waits to hear whether German officials will allow him to 
speak to Frankel to explain the process for appointing a new 
attorney.

<HEADLINE> GOP Restores Ban on Faulty Reactor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After objections by Democrats, Republicans  
restored a long-standing legislative ban against reopening a leaky 
nuclear reactor in the district of a Democratic congressman who 
quit the GOP in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans meeting Friday to craft a House-Senate compromise  
bill financing next year's federal energy and water projects had 
decided to drop a prohibition against using the Brookhaven National 
Laboratory's experimental reactor in New York's eastern Long 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
	They changed their minds later in the day, a decision that came  
after a private meeting in which Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., insisted 
the ban be restored, said officials who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old lab is in the district of Rep. Mike Forbes,  
D-N.Y., who said when he left the party last summer that the GOP 
had been captured by ``extremists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure it was a tragic oversight,'' Forbes told a reporter  
when asked if he believed the omission was an attempt at political 
retribution. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban against reopening the reactor has been in the annual  
energy-water bill for the last two years. It was also included in 
versions of the bill the House and Senate had approved earlier this 
year for fiscal 2000, which begins next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We regarded it as highly unusual and punitive for them to take  
out a provision that was in both bills'' earlier this year, Obey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The reactor has been a major issue on Long Island since the  
Energy Department revealed in 1997 that radioactive tritium had 
been leaking and contaminating ground water at least since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes has long sponsored the annual language that has kept the  
reactor shut, along with former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes attended Friday's bargaining session and told his  
colleagues that removal of the Brookhaven language left him ``a 
little bit mystified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the prohibition had been uncontroversial for years,  
``and to my knowledge until the last 24 hours it was 
noncontroversial in the House and Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ron Packard, R-Calif., chairman of the House Appropriations  
Committee's subcommittee that wrote the bill, said environmental 
problems Republicans had about the reactor had been resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just determined that was the best way of resolving it,''  
Packard said. 
</P>
<P>
	The reactor, used for advanced research in physics, medicine and  
other fields, has been out of commission since December 1996 
because of leaks of radioactive water from a spent fuel tank. It 
was opened in 1965.

<HEADLINE> 17 Cuban Refugees Reach Florida </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- A wooden boat carrying 17 Cuban  
refugeess who said they were at sea for a week landed in Florida 
early Friday and asked residents to call police. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12 men, four women and an 8-year-old boy made landfall near  
Palm Beach, just southeast of West Palm Beach, at about 1 a.m., 
said Border Patrol spokesman Dan Geoghegan. 
</P>
<P>
	They reached shore in what appeared to be an old fishing boat  
powered by a diesel engine, Geoghegan said, though the group said 
the boat was homemade. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the group said they were from Camaguey, the largest  
city in central Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten of the Cubans knocked on the door of a nearby residence  
while the others watched the boat, police said. The resident then 
called police. 
</P>
<P>
	Police turned the group over to the Border Patrol, the  
enforcement arm of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. On 
Friday afternoon the refugees were being held for processing at the 
INS's Krome Detention Center outside Miami.

<HEADLINE> Miami Stone Circle Examined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A stone circle unearthed at the mouth of the Miami  
River may mark a place where people gathered hundreds of years ago 
to exchange goods and build arts and crafts, geologists say. 
</P>
<P>
	University of Miami scientists, after four months of  
investigation, recently determined the origin of two palm-sized 
primitive stone axes found at the site. 
</P>
<P>
	Geologists believe they were produced hundreds of years ago by  
people who lived 530 miles away in central Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say the evidence shows ancient South Floridians  
maintained robust trade and cultural links with distant tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rocks can't fly. The axes had to be traded here from outside  
the state,'' Christopher Eck, director of the Miami-Dade Division 
of Historic Preservation, said in Thursday's Miami Herald. 
</P>
<P>
	Geologists determined that the axes were not produced locally  
because the tools were made from basalt, a hard, volcanic rock not 
found in Florida. Researchers said they were able to pinpoint the 
origin of the axes to within a few hundred miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The site, known as the Miami Circle, was discovered last year.  
</P>
<P>
	A developer had planned to build a $126 million apartment  
complex at the location. But a circuit judge ruled last June that 
the county can take the land. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury trial, planned for October, will determine how much the  
county would have to reimburse developer Michael Baumann for the 
2.2-acre property.

<HEADLINE> Social Security Statements Coming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Social Security Administration will begin  
mailing annual contribution and benefit statements to 125 million 
workers on Oct. 1, offering help to Americans who are preparing for 
retirement -- and a nudge to those who aren't. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good financial planning tool,'' said Social Security  
Commissioner Kenneth S. Apfel. ``We're hoping it will help people 
understand what Social Security can provide, but also encourage 
them to do further planning for retirement savings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, the Social Security statements have been available  
upon request, and 37 million Americans have asked for theirs since 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting Oct. 1, the personalized letters will be mailed  
automatically, in batches of 500,000 a day, timed so that every 
worker over age 25 will receive an updated one each year about 
three months before his or her birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress voted in 1989 to require the mailings, which at 56  
cents a letter will cost about $70 million a year. Because of the 
personal nature of the information, Social Security officials said 
the letters will be mailed first class. 
</P>
<P>
	Commercial Data Center Inc., a printing company located outside  
Dayton, Ohio, which got the contract for the job, has hired 20 new 
employees and will be dropping off 40,000 pounds of mail a day at 
the city's airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Not even the Internal Revenue Service does a bigger mailing to  
American households each year when tax forms go out. 
</P>
<P>
	The Social Security Administration has been gearing up for the  
enormous task since 1995, by sending sample statements to about 73 
million people, most over age 40. The statements have been 
simplified during the course of the test to a four-page format that 
includes: 
</P>
<P>
	--A two-column chart showing annual earnings for each year  
subject to Social Security and Medicare taxes from a person's first 
job to 1998. These numbers are significant because the amount of 
future Social Security benefits depend, in part, on a person's past 
earnings and tax contributions. In 1998, all earnings were subject 
to a 1.45 percent Medicare payroll tax and earnings up to $68,400 
were subject to a 6.2 percent Social Security tax. 
</P>
<P>
	--The total amount of taxes a person has paid into the retirement  
system over the years, and separately, what his or her employers 
have paid. Employers must match employees' Social Security and 
Medicare contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	--Estimates of monthly retirement benefits assuming a person  
continued earning at his or her current salary level until retiring 
early at age 62; on time at 65, 66 or 67; or late at age 70. The 
age of eligibility for full Social Security benefits is scheduled 
to rise incrementally to 67 from 65. Those who choose to retire 
even later get higher monthly benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	--Estimates of monthly disability benefits if a worker became  
disabled today. 
</P>
<P>
	--Estimates of survivor benefits a worker's family would receive  
if the worker died this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter also gives a toll-free telephone number that people  
are urged to call if they find mistakes in their statements. Social 
Security officials expect to get about 233,000 such calls during 
the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people getting the new statements may be pleasantly  
surprised to discover that Social Security provides financial 
protection for the young as well as the old. Polls have shown that 
the program's disability and survivor benefits are not widely 
understood. 
</P>
<P>
	For many, however, the statements are likely to be a wake-up  
call, showing just how modest a retirement income Social Security 
provides, said Don Blandin, president of the American Savings 
Education Council. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a very important line in the letter: 'Social Security  
benefits were not intended to be the only source of income for you 
and your family when you retire,''' said Blandin, whose group runs 
a public service campaign encouraging people to save. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial planners generally tell working people that they will  
need about 70 percent of their present income to live comfortably 
when they retire. For average earners, Social Security benefits 
will replace only about 40 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Social Security's own looming financial problems are also  
acknowledged in the letters. The program is expected to run short 
of cash in 2034, and lawmakers remain sharply divided over the best 
remedy. 
</P>
<P>
	In an introductory message to the new statements, Apfel says,  
``The program has changed in the past to meet the demands of the 
times and must do so again.''

<HEADLINE> High-Tech Crime-Fight Lab Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINTHICUM, Md. (AP) -- The Defense Department showed off its  
latest arsenal of high-tech crime-fighting tools Friday, a $15 
million computer lab where it can trace hackers across the 
Internet, unscramble hidden files and rebuild smashed floppy disks 
that were cut in pieces. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators will use the new Defense Computer Forensics Lab,  
located in a nondescript brick building south of Baltimore, to 
unravel electronic evidence in cases of espionage, murder and other 
crimes involving America's military. 
</P>
<P>
	Using powerful computers and special software, these 80 digital  
detectives can trace a hacker across the Internet to his keyboard, 
recover files thought to be safely deleted and quickly search tens 
of thousands of documents for an important phrase. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyberspace is ``a new kind of wild, lawless sort of frontier,''  
said Christopher Mellon, a deputy assistant Defense secretary. ``We 
have important national interests, and we have to be able to 
function.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers envision sharing equipment and secret techniques they  
develop to help FBI, state and local authorities prosecute 
criminals who use computers, such as drug-dealers who track profits 
and customers with accounting software. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI even established its own minilab upstairs in the  
building, though most of its digital forensics work will continue 
to be performed in downtown Washington at its headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Virtually every white-collar crime case today brings at least  
one computer, if not a whole network of computers,'' FBI Assistant 
Director Donald Kerr said. ``We need people who are well 
prepared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Ferguson, the lab's director, showed how experts can use  
these high-tech tools to enhance garbled audio recordings -- even 
digitally mute one voice in a conversation to listen to another -- 
and recover computer files from disks and tapes even if they had 
been deleted. 
</P>
<P>
	The lab can dissect virtually any type of computer, from  
handheld devices to Apple computers to those using Windows or even 
specialized software. It's developing a way to analyze all machines 
using a powerful assembly of computers working together, called a 
``Beowulf cluster,'' technology also used by NASA and some Energy 
Department researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	One lab worker, David Lang, demonstrated how investigators can  
reassemble and read from a computer's floppy disk that a criminal 
trying to hide evidence might cut into pieces and crumple. 
</P>
<P>
	The procedure, developed a decade ago but still being perfected,  
takes ``a day if you're lucky, to a month if it's something you 
haven't encountered before,'' Lang said. ``It's basically just a 
jigsaw puzzle to be put back together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson expects to handle about 400 cases each year from all  
the military branches, mostly crimes where a computer might have 
played part in espionage, deaths or sexual assaults. About 10 
percent of cases involve tracing hackers snooping through military 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The new program also trains investigators, who will be assigned  
full time to military posts and bases worldwide. Typical classes 
are three weeks of about a dozen students learning about espionage, 
hackers, networks and special computer hardware. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we intend to handle here is the big and large,'' Ferguson  
said, citing examples where huge amounts of data need to be 
analyzed or where a particularly savvy criminal scrambled his 
digital records and won't give up his password. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Ferguson and others declined to discuss specific cases  
already under way, they described as rare those involving encrypted 
files. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House agreed last week to allow sale of the most  
powerful data-scrambling technology with virtually no restrictions, 
although military and law enforcement officials have long warned 
that criminals and terrorists might also use the technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson said he was confident that techniques to break those  
messages will be adequate once Congress approves a proposal by the 
Clinton administration to give the FBI $80 million over four years 
for the technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Department officials also acknowledged that the lab's  
proximity to the nearby National Security Agency, the government's 
premier code-breaking organization, was a primary factor in 
deciding its location.

<HEADLINE> Grizzlies Sold for $200 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- The Vancouver Grizzlies have  
been sold to the owner of the NHL's St. Louis Blues for $200 
million, and the new owner refuses to say what his long-term plans 
are for the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no current plan to move the Grizzlies,'' said Bill  
Laurie, who nonetheless refused to give any assurances to local 
fans that he won't try to move the team in the next year or two. 
</P>
<P>
	Laurie, along with his wife, Nancy, earlier this year tried  
unsuccessfully to purchase the Denver Nuggets. They own the new 
Kiel Center in downtown St. Louis -- an arena that all too often 
sits empty. That could change if Laurie decides to move the team, 
but such a scenario is at least a year or two away. 
</P>
<P>
	Franchises wanting to relocate must submit a petition to the  
league before March 1 in order to move for the following season. 
But the Grizzlies are prohibited by their expansion agreement from 
making such an application before May 15, 2000 -- a rule that, 
although it could be amended, would seem to ensure the team will 
continue to be based in Vancouver for the next two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase price of $200 million was confirmed to The  
Associated Press by two league sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity. Former owner John McCaw would only say that he sold the 
team for a profit. 
</P>
<P>
	One year ago, the New Jersey Nets sold for $150 million --  
meaning the Laurie purchase has driven up the value of the other 28 
teams substantially. 
</P>
<P>
	Laurie, an avid basketball fan and a former point guard for  
Memphis State, agreed in April to buy the Colorado Avalanche of the 
NHL, the Denver Nuggets of the NBA and Denver's new Pepsi Center 
for $400 million. But he lost out when a rival group, given a 
second chance to bid, offered $461 million. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the Grizzlies sale came just as league officials, from  
coaches to general managers to support staff, were arriving in 
Vancouver to attend the league meetings held every other year. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner David Stern voiced his personal opposition to a  
relocation, citing the league's record of not having any franchise 
migrations since the Clippers moved from San Diego to Los Angeles 
in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my goal to see the Grizzlies stay and succeed in  
Vancouver,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision on whether to allow the team to move, however,  
would ultimately be made by the league's Board of Governors. Of the 
league's 29 owners, only 15 would be needed to approve a 
relocation. A three-quarters majority would be needed to approve 
the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not unprecedented for an NBA team to move, but on the  
other hand when you place a franchise someplace, you ask the fans 
to make a certain commitment to the team,'' Stern said. ``And it's 
not inappropriate for the fans to expect the team to have some 
commitment to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laurie, asked repeatedly if he would give the fans of Vancouver  
some kind of commitment or reassurance, refused to say anything of 
substance regarding his long-term plans for the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really feel uncomfortable with the skepticism, only because  
this is a big day for our family,'' Laurie said. ``This is a big 
step for us, and somehow some of the excitement and fun is being 
taken away by the cloud hanging over us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCaw also owns the NHL Vancouver Canucks and GM Place, the  
team's 19,000-seat arena. Both had been for sale, but McCaw said 
they are now off the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation has swirled about the future of the Grizzlies  
franchise since McCaw said last month he was willing to sell part 
or all of his Orca Bay sports empire. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grizzlies have met with limited success since joining the  
NBA, never winning more than 19 games. Vancouver was 8-42 in the 
lockout-shortened 1999 season, the worst record in the 29-team 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareef Abdur-Rahim, the Grizzlies' best player, reacted  
cautiously to the sale announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``With everything happening as fast as it has, the reassuring  
thing is that the people I trust and the people I believe in are 
still there,'' Abdur-Rahim said. ``I believe in (general manager) 
Stu (Jackson) and the people up there, and as long as that 
situation is the same, it's cool. That was the determining factor 
in me signing (a contract extension last season) -- Stu being there 
and making me believe in his vision of what we need to do.''

<HEADLINE> Pan American Hires New Hoops Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDINBURG, Texas (AP) -- Bob Hoffman, men's basketball coach at  
Oklahoma Baptist for nine seasons, was hired Friday as coach of the 
Texas-Pan American basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman inherits a program that has lost and regained its NCAA  
certification, been dropped by its athletic conference and dealt 
with alleged misuse of university money by previous coach Delray 
Brooks -- all in the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman said during a news conference Friday that he would work  
on restoring the Broncs' reputation by ``just doing the right thing 
and doing it as often as we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in this thing together,'' Hoffman said. ``We're going to  
be about servant leadership, not power leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman had a 242-79 record at Oklahoma Baptist, making it to  
the NAIA championship game in 1993 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Bison teams went to five consecutive NAIA tournaments this  
decade. After missing the tournament in 1998, they made it to the 
1999 NAIA quarterfinals and finished last season 31-7. Hoffman was 
Sooner Athletic Conference coach of the year in 1996 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman previously coached the Southern Nazarene women's team,  
which won the 1989 NAIA championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``We accept coach Hoffman's resignation with sincere regret, but  
he will go with our very best wishes,'' Oklahoma Baptist president 
Mark Brister said in a statement released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks was fired on Aug. 23 because Texas-Pan American officials  
believe he deposited a $25,000 check from Southwest Missouri into 
his personal account and then made withdrawals from the account. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks acknowledged that $25,000 was placed in his account last  
December but denied that he deposited it or that he told someone 
else to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Hidalgo County District Attorney Rene Guerra has said he will  
seek a grand jury indictment of Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas-Pan Am athletic director William Weidner said Hoffman's  
reputation was important. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were looking for someone who had unquestioned integrity,  
someone who truly cares about the student athlete as a person, not 
just as a basketball player, and has demonstrated that through the 
years through actions,'' Weidner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks played at Indiana and Providence and most recently spent  
five years as an assistant at Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	He was hired to restore Pan American's reputation, sullied when  
the school lost its NCAA certification in July 1996 over charges 
that two assistants improperly helped potential recruits with 
correspondence coursework. 
</P>
<P>
	Certification was restored in May 1998, after the Sun Belt  
Conference had dropped the school. Texas-Pan American remains an 
independent.

<HEADLINE> NBA To Crack Down on Physical Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Expect to hear a lot more  
whistles at the start of the NBA season under a crackdown on 
physical play that was outlined to the league's referees Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rules that were always on the books we are now going to  
enforce,'' NBA vice president of operations Rod Thorn said. ``In 
the exhibition season, there will be more fouls than normal, but 
once the season starts the players will adjust and adjust quickly. 
There are no good players who want to sit on the bench with three 
fouls after two minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four official rules changes are being adopted for the 1999-00  
season, but the crackdown on overly physical play is not among 
them. The league will simply instruct its referees to keep a 
vigilant eye out for clutching, grabbing and banging away from the 
ball, or players being hindered running around screens. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, what constitutes a foul in one ref's mind might not  
in another ref's mind, and Thorn acknowledged there will be a gray 
area regarding how much contact will be allowed away from the ball. 
But he said the league office will work with the referees in an 
effort to develop a standard that is consistent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect all our refs to know what to call and what not to  
call,'' Thorn said. ``We don't want a lot of ticky-tack fouls 
called.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting between the referees and the league's competition  
committee was one of several held among NBA personnel on a full day 
of activity in the league meetings, which are held every two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The day began with a general session, including a speech by  
commissioner David Stern, attended by team employees. 
</P>
<P>
	With trade talk at a relative lull -- although Scottie Pippen and  
Glen Rice rumors refused to die -- much of the focus was on the 
rules changes, be they official or unofficial. 
</P>
<P>
	Thorn, in a candid admission of what's ailing the game  
aesthetically, said the league wants to encourage fast breaks and a 
more wide-open style of play. The NBA is coming off the 
lowest-scoring season in its history, one in which just the 
Sacramento Kings averaged 100 points. The league-wide average of 91 
points a game was the lowest since the shot clock was introduced in 
1954-55. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of the 29 teams, 25 of the offenses are basically the same,''  
Thorn said, ``and I dare say that the majority of teams don't have 
a secondary fast break in their play book anymore. We're hoping 
this will get offenses to do some different things. We want to see 
some different looks and attacks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The officials rules changes are:  
</P>
<P>
	--A prohibition on forearm checking, except below the free-throw  
line. 
</P>
<P>
	--A 5-second rule limiting the amount of time an offensive player  
not facing the basket can control the ball below the free-throw 
line before he must pass, shoot or pick up his dribble. 
</P>
<P>
	--Resetting the shot clock to 14 seconds instead of 24 on certain  
stoppages of play. 
</P>
<P>
	--An exemption from illegal defense rules for players positioned  
on the strong side of the court. 
</P>
<P>
	The change in the illegal defense rule will amount to allowing a  
zone defense in the low post. Theoretically, it will encourage 
defenses to use double-teams to guard against entry passes into the 
low post, thereby deterring offenses from dumping the ball into the 
big man and then standing around waiting for him to either make a 
move or pass the ball out to the 3-point line. The result, 
hopefully, will be more cutting, passing and mid-range jump 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be harder to score in a set, half-court offense,  
so it'll be in teams' best interests to run, push the ball upcourt 
and shoot the ball early,'' Thorn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coaches and team executives said they will take a wait-and-see  
attitude toward the rules changes, which were first enforced during 
summer league games and resulted in a inordinate number of fouls. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're good recommendations, but we'll have to see  
how they are,'' Indiana president Donnie Walsh said. ``I think the 
league will be open to adjusting them to get the game back to where 
it was.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Candidates Like Home Schooling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The growing home school movement commanded an  
audience Friday with five of the nine Republicans running for 
president, each proclaiming that if parents want to teach their 
children at home, the government should let them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We view home schooling as something to be respected and  
something to be protected,'' Texas Gov. George W. Bush told a 
conference of the Home School Legal Defense Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``Respected for the energy and commitment of loving mothers and  
loving fathers. Protected -- protected -- from the interference of 
government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The candidates, who appeared separately in the Daughters of the  
American Revolution auditorium, were unanimous in their salute of 
the movement's progress. An association-sponsored study last spring 
showed that home-schooled students, numbering an estimated 1.5 
million, score well above the national median on standardized tests 
and often study above their normal grade level. 
</P>
<P>
	``No parent in America should be forced to send their child to a  
lousy school. Period,'' said publisher Steve Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've shamed the regular school systems with what you've  
achieved. For those who have carped and criticized and said, 'What 
about socialization?' ... you look at some of our schools, you call 
that socialization?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Bauer, an undersecretary in President's Reagan's Education  
Department, promised, ``When I'm in the White House, you will have 
a reliable friend for home schooling sitting in the Oval Office.'' 
Home-schooling parents are ``on the front lines, the cutting edge 
of the education debate,'' Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The speaker's roster of presidential candidates, including  
Republicans Pat Buchanan and Alan Keyes, plus independent New 
Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith, was testimony to the potency of education 
in this campaign and the growing appeal of home schooling among 
religious and political conservatives disenchanted with public 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan said home schooling parents ``teach values but we can't  
give up on the public schools either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Public schools would be better off without the civil liberties  
groups and teachers unions and with ``God and the Ten Commandments 
put back into the schools,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Voicing scorn for other candidates' ``half-baked arguments for  
expediency,'' Keyes gave a fire-and-brimstone exhortation for moral 
self-confidence. Parents who home school have shown courage and 
should carry it into the broader political arena, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His pitch rising to such shrillness that many in the audience  
put their fingers in the ears, Keyes said: ``It's time for courage 
to be restored -- not by leaders like G.W. Bush, but by people like 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the association was founded in 1983, when home schooling  
was not even legal in all 50 states as it is today, the number of 
children whose parents eschew schools for at-home lessons grew from 
a couple hundred to today's estimate of 1.5 million to 1.7 million, 
said HSLDA spokesman Richard Jefferson. 
</P>
<P>
	During a musical slide show between political speakers and  
prayer offerings, the audience -- sprinkled with baby strollers and 
slouched children in play clothes -- burst into applause when the 
screen flashed Patrick Henry's immortal line, ``Give me liberty or 
give me death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Farris, president of the Virginia-based association,  
said his 65,000-member families -- up from 29,000 in 1993 -- have 
just one message to Washington policymakers: ``Leave us alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush offered just a couple sentences on home schooling before  
launching into his standard stump speech. ``I know this might not 
be the proper forum for a political speech,'' Bush said. ``But I 
can't resist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He encouraged activism by his religious audience. ``The role of  
the president is to say to people of faith, 'You're welcome to help 
change America because changing hearts will change America for the 
better,''' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan Childress, visiting from Kalona, Iowa, with her  
home-schooled son, sported a Keyes campaign button. But, after 
hearing Bush, she told a reporter: ``Maybe it won't be so bad if he 
is elected. I'm beginning to feel like I can more trust what he's 
saying.''

<HEADLINE> Cards' DT Smith Ends Holdout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Defensive tackle Mark Smith ended his  
holdout Friday and accepted the Arizona Cardinals' minimum offer of 
$325,000 for this season minus the salary he would have received 
for the two games he missed. 
</P>
<P>
	That means the third-year pro will get just under $285,000, far  
less than the more than $1 million he originally had demanded. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he was ready to play football,'' Smith's agent, Gil  
Thompson, said. ``It was an instinctive type of thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith had virtually no leverage in his holdout. He couldn't sign  
with another team and had to be available to play for at least six 
games this season to count toward him becoming a restricted free 
agent next year and an unrestricted free agent in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's play didn't help him much either. Without Smith,  
Arizona is sixth in the NFL in total defense after two games. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, the Cardinals offered $500,000, but withdrew that  
offer and retreated to the $325,000 Smith was due under NFL rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson declined to say the holdout was a mistake or that Smith  
regrets not accepting the $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just a small contract battle in a war,'' Thompson  
said. ``I'd prefer to look forward instead of backward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was to fly from his home in Auburn, Ala., Friday night and  
join the team for practice Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy that he's in,'' coach Vince Tobin said. ``He's a  
good player, a big part of our defense last year. I'm just 
disappointed that it took this long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tobin said he will have to see how Smith looks when he gets to  
Arizona before making a decision on whether to suit him up for 
Monday night's game against the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no idea what kind of shape he's in,'' Tobin said. ``He  
hasn't seen any of our defenses ... It probably will be awfully 
hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith had 56 tackles, 31 solos, as a rookie. Last year, as a  
starter, he led the team in sacks with nine. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Greene, the Hall of Fame defensive lineman who as Cardinals'  
defensive line coach worked extensively to make Smith a force in 
the NFL, said Smith has hurt himself greatly by the holdout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had great hopes for Mark, as did everybody in the  
organization,'' Greene said. ``I was extremely disappointed that he 
wasn't here during mini-camp and training camp. I thought he needed 
that to move to the next level. I was disappointed and angry. Now 
that he's here, I've got to get over it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's agreement leaves rookie offensive tackle L.J. Shelton,  
the 21st pick in the first round, as the only Cardinals' holdout.

<HEADLINE> JonBenet Grand Jury Resumes Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- As a grand jury resumes investigating the  
JonBenet Ramsey slaying, county officials are asking prosecutors to 
justify why they should keep funding the inquiry if no indictment 
is returned by the end of next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve grand jurors resumed work Thursday for the first time in  
four months with the October deadline looming. 
</P>
<P>
	County Commissioners say the grand jury and District Attorney  
Alex Hunter will have to come up with new information to justify 
more funds for the grand jury and the investigation, which has 
already cost the county more than $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Among witnesses said to have testified already are police,  
forensics experts and friends and relatives of the Ramseys, 
including JonBenet's brother, Burke. Her parents are not believed 
to have made an appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	JonBenet's body was found beaten and strangled in the basement  
of her parents' home Dec. 26, 1996. Her parents, John and Patsy 
Ramsey, remain under a police ``umbrella of suspicion,'' but have 
maintained their innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter turned to the grand jury last year after the case bogged  
down in wrangling over accusations the investigation was bungled by 
authorities, who allowed John Ramsey to search the house for 
evidence. Ramsey, accompanied by a friend, found his daughter's 
body and contaminated evidence, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police in turn blamed the district attorney for not making an  
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury could issue an indictment, put out a report  
without bringing any charges, or disband without taking any action.

<HEADLINE> Whole Foods To Spin Off Internet Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, (AP) -- Whole Foods Inc. said Thursday it will spin off  
its Internet grocery business and sell shares of the Web venture to 
the public within a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Austin-based natural foods store chain said it wants to  
build a ``healthy-living'' Web site where consumers can get 
information as well as groceries. 
</P>
<P>
	John P. Mackey, the company's founder and chief executive, will  
lead the new company, to be called WholePeople.com. The store chain 
sold a 13.5 percent stake in the new company to venture 
capitalists, whom Mackey would not identify. 
</P>
<P>
	Whole Foods' stock lost more than 9 percent in trading Friday on  
the NASDAQ stock market, down 3 15/32 to 33 3/32. 
</P>
<P>
	Whole Foods is the nation's largest natural foods chain, with  
more than 90 stores in more than 20 states and Washington, D.C. It 
stresses food free of pesticides, preservatives and sweeteners. Its 
stores include Whole Foods Market, Bread &AMP; Circus, Bread of Life, 
Fresh Fields, Merchant of Vino and Wellspring Grocery. The company 
has also moved into the coffee roasting and nutritional-supplements 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, with 14,200 employees, reported sales last year of  
nearly $1.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The new online company will include Amrion Inc., a mail-order  
vitamin-sales firm that Whole Foods bought in 1997, and American 
WholeHealth Inc., a holistic-medicine company. 
</P>
<P>
	An analyst said the spin-off indicates that selling groceries  
over the Internet, which Whole Foods started to do in March, isn't 
a profitable business. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you're going to see an explosion of people  
buying broccoli over the Internet, but you will see an explosion in 
people looking for information or easier-to-ship products,'' 
Matthew Patsky of Adams Harkness in Boston told the Austin 
American-Statesman. His company helped find investors for the new 
Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Online grocery sales last year were just $148 million, according  
to Jupiter Communications, an online research company in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Whole Foods is taking a non-recurring charge of $3.5 million to  
close two Amrion divisions. The company also said it would take a 
$6 million charge this quarter for software and hardware purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	Removing Amrion and WholeFoods.com from Whole Foods' balance  
sheet takes away $1.1 billion in revenue and about $34.7 million in 
net income, the company said. That means Whole Foods' fiscal year 
2000 earnings will likely be 18 to 26 cents below analysts' 
estimates of $2.13 per share, Mackey said. 
</P>
<P>
	He predicted that Whole Foods' traditional business will grow 15  
to 20 percent next year.

<HEADLINE> Is There Fertility After Menopause? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An experimental ovarian tissue transplant that  
may eventually allow women to turn back their biological clocks and 
have children past menopause is raising ethical questions with some 
experts. 
</P>
<P>
	The procedure was performed in February on a 30-year-old woman  
in the hopes of reversing symptoms of early menopause brought on by 
the removal of her ovaries. Four months after the implant, she 
ovulated and had a normal menstrual cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Kutluk Oktay, who performed the operation at New York  
Methodist Hospital, says the surgery gives new hope for young 
infertile women, especially those who had cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	He has stressed that the procedure should be reserved for women  
with premature menopause triggered by serious illnesses -- and not 
be considered a panacea for otherwise healthy women who want to 
have children later in life. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's premature to expand the technology for use that way. It  
may come, like all these other developments in the fertility field. 
But for myself, that's not my focus,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts on medical ethics worry that such fertility-prolonging  
treatments may eventually be abused. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert J. Stillman, medical director of the Shady Grove  
Fertility Reproductive Science Center in Rockville, Md., said that 
while important, the advance should only be used to help women who 
have lost their ovaries for medical reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``The use of the technology only for patients in need would  
eliminate the ethical issues,'' Stillman said, adding that elective 
surgery to remove part of an ovary may actually cause infertility 
through scar tissue, bleeding and infection. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like most medical advances, this one has some benefits and  
some almost startling risks,'' Arthur Caplan, of the University of 
Pennsylvania's Center for Bioethics, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why some questions need to be posed, said Caplan, who  
wrote about the ethical questions of such a possibility in his 
book, ``Am I My Brother's Keeper?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In the far distant future, would we see people just using such  
an organ transplant solely for eugenic purposes? ... Can you ever 
be too old to be a parent, reach a point where you couldn't claim 
your frozen ovary back?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Wulf Utian, executive director of the North American  
Menopause Society, which was meeting Friday in Manhattan, called 
the concept ``intriguing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said a woman who had her ovaries removed to be reimplanted 20  
years later would have to be on hormone replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it would be ethical to remove ovaries and store  
them at this time for someone in that situation,'' he said. 
``Because you prove something's possible, that doesn't 
automatically mean that it's necessary,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the procedure is being greeted enthusiastically by  
women's advocates. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hope it can offer to women is really the important issue  
here. It's staggering,'' said Marcia Ann Gillespie, editor in chief 
of Ms. magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe this could become a routine procedure that would allow  
women in their 50s and 60s to have children. ... All of our notions 
of age and aging and time have been thrown on their ear anyway. 
Sitting here, thinking about a 60-year-old woman having children 
seems less and less far fetched. It really doesn't surprise me,'' 
she said.

<HEADLINE> Kids Impressive at Ryder Cup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- The kid can play. And so, too, can the  
rest of Europe's Ryder Cup rookies. 
</P>
<P>
	Sergio Garcia, the 19-year-old European version of Tiger Woods  
known as ``El Nino,'' wasn't the only rookie to stir the crowd 
Friday as Europe took a 6-2 lead in the first day of the 33rd Ryder 
Cup matches. Rookies contributed to the scoring in every match they 
played, and the only rookie to lose was not a European but an 
American, David Duval. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia and Miguel Jimenez of Spain, Paul Lawrie of Scotland and  
Padraig Harrington of Ireland helped the Europeans take a 2 1/2-1 1/2 
lead in the opening foursome matches Friday, and then Lawrie, 
Garcia and Jimenez played key roles in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We no longer have seven rookies,'' European team captain Mark  
James said after the morning matches. ``I think it will do the new 
boys some good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the most closely followed match of the morning, Garcia and  
Jesper Parnevik of Sweden defeated Woods and Tom Lehman 2 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia and Woods, both trained in golf since age 3, were billed  
as the rivalry of the future, a feeling that intensified when 
Garcia and Woods fought it out last month in the PGA Championship. 
But Garcia said that didn't come into play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here it's Europe against the USA, it's not Sergio against  
Tiger. Everybody needs to understand that,'' Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Europeans said they were nervous but didn't lose confidence  
even as the heavily favored Americans jumped to leads in three of 
the first four matches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't feel cool inside, but after that first drive, it  
wasn't that bad, really,'' said Lawrie, who played with fellow Scot 
and Ryder Cup veteran Colin Montgomerie in the morning. They 
defeated Duval, America's only rookie, and Phil Mickelson 3 and 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very disappointed,'' Duval said. ``The match certainly  
didn't seem like it should have been a 3 and 2 match.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Lawrie played well in the match, it was Montgomerie, who  
often has been frustrated playing in the United States, who helped 
his partner allay the jitters by holing several key putts of 6-10 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's like a rock,'' Lawrie said of Montgomerie.  
</P>
<P>
	It was not that the United States team played poorly. Most of  
the matches were close throughout. 
</P>
<P>
	``The striking thing was the standard of play,'' James said.  
``Both teams played fabulous golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payne Stewart and Davis Love III had several chances to put away  
the all-rookie team of Jimenez and Harrington in the morning, but 
managed only a draw worth a half-point. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played good and we got a halve out of it,'' Stewart said.  
``For two rookies, they played extremely well together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was more of the same in the afternoon, with European rookies  
playing in three of the four best ball matches. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson and Jim Furyk had a combined score of 60, yet lost to  
Garcia and Parvenik. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very disappointing,'' said Mickelson, who missed an  
8-foot birdie putt on 18 that would have halved the match. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Parnevik, with four birdies and an eagle on the front  
nine, who kept the Europeans in that match until Garcia chipped in 
for eagle on the par-5, 14th hole for a 1-up lead that stood. 
</P>
<P>
	``A fantastic day,'' Garcia said. ``The rookies have done well.  
Sometimes the people say things that are wrong and we are trying to 
prove that and just trying to play the best we can.''

<HEADLINE> Arlington, Wyo., is Real Windy City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Wyo. (AP) -- Chicago has a lot of nerve calling itself  
the Windy City when there are places like Arlington on the map. 
</P>
<P>
	Arlington (population 20, if you get here before one couple  
leaves for San Diego for the winter) is one of the windiest towns 
in America. The wind blows an average of 24 mph, day in and day 
out. Sometimes it really whistles. 
</P>
<P>
	``One-hundred thirty mph is the fastest I've ever seen it, and  
that's as high as it ever got. You can't stand up hardly,'' said 
73-year-old Ted Griffith, a teller of what sound like tall tales of 
the Wyoming prairie. (Among other things, he insists a 
headlight-spooked deer can be grabbed by the antlers, tossed in the 
back seat and driven all the way home with its head on your 
shoulder.) 
</P>
<P>
	Arlington, 80 miles west of Cheyenne, is a few houses and other  
buildings huddled at the south end of Rock Creek Valley, a shallow 
seam in the burlap-colored prairie. The wind blows out of the vast, 
flat expanse to the west of Arlington and squeezes between the 
mountains to the north and south of town. Interstate 80 runs 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll blow cars off that dang road coming through here,''  
Griffith said. ``I don't know how many people I've pulled out from 
under cars. Wind just blew them over and tipped them over, on that 
ice -- shwipt! -- into the ditch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Corri Rabidue, a waitress at the Outpost Cafe, which has a small  
counter with two stools, said Arlington fills with tractor-trailers 
on the worst days. 
</P>
<P>
	``We always laugh that you'll know if a person's not from around  
here,'' she said. ``If it's a nice day, they're the ones that are 
weaving all over the road. If it's bad, we're the ones that can 
drive straight because we're so used to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With winter come wind chills way below zero, and blowing snow  
can close I-80. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never like it,'' Ms. Rabidue said. ``When you've had weeks  
on end with nothing but wind into the 40 mph all day, you really 
get sick of it. I mean, because it just whistles. 
</P>
<P>
	``But you just kind of deal with it.''  
</P>
<P>
	The wind is actually a boon to some. Two years ago, a company  
called SeaWest began building sleek white windmills on the edge of 
the valley for some regional utility companies. The 105 structures, 
each 180 feet high, generate enough electricity for about 20,000 
homes. The whirling blades look like some oversized science fair 
project. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of the better wind sites in the country, with very  
consistent wind speed for a large portion of the year,'' said 
SeaWest vice president Steve Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
	When the wind hits 65 mph, however, the turbines have to be shut  
down to keep from overtaxing the system. 
</P>
<P>
	Rock Creek Valley is home to a few ranching families -- the  
Whites, the Brokaws, the Simmses, the Dunmires -- who spend more 
time in the wind than anybody. Up and down the valley, the 
fresh-cut hay piled into wooden bins looks like enormous loaves of 
bread. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had times when we're haying and the wind comes up and  
just takes it out of the country,'' said Shelly Dunmire, who 
stopped in the Outpost for lunch. ``You find it in the trees or in 
the creek or you just never see it again. In the winter, one of the 
jokes is when you want to feed your herd, you're really feeding 
your neighbors'.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a recent late-afternoon sun gilded the hills and dappled the  
valleys in shadow, Audrey Brokaw and her daughter finished herding 
cattle off the rim. The family has one of the smallest ranches in 
the valley, about 10,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	``You learn to work with the elements,'' she said, patting the  
nose of her black mare. ``You work as best you can in such a manner 
that when it's still, you get busy and do a lot of work, a lot of 
stacks. And when it's windy, you do something else.''

<HEADLINE>  Typhoon in Japan Kills 26 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Typhoon Bart lashed Japan on Friday with driving  
rains and winds that shattered glass windows, downed power lines, 
knocked over cranes and killed at least 26 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's northern island of Hokkaido braced for the storm, which  
was traveling northeast over the ocean off the western coast of 
Japan. Packing winds of up to 78 mph and moving at 40 mph, Bart was 
expected to hit Hokkaido early Saturday, the Meteorological Agency 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, a tornado unrelated to the typhoon tore through a  
city in central Japan, slightly injuring 262 people, mostly 
schoolchildren hit by glass from shattered windows. The twister 
swept through Toyohashi, 140 miles west of Tokyo, for about 30 
minutes Friday morning, destroying three homes and damaging dozens 
of others. 
</P>
<P>
	Bart wreaked havoc on southern Japan. On the island of Kyushu,  
the bodies of 14 people -- including two elderly women -- were 
recovered from homes submerged by high sea waves in Shiranui, a 
coastal town in Kumamoto prefecture, 560 miles southwest of Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in Kumamoto, a 79-year-old man was found dead of electric  
shock from a power line that had fallen onto a street. A 
50-year-old man died from blood loss after he was hit by broken 
glass in his home, police spokesman Shigeji Tominaga said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hiroshima, 430 miles southwest of Tokyo, two factory cranes  
toppled by strong winds crashed on a building, killing three 
workers and injuring one, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	A 50-year-old man died Thursday as the typhoon approached  
Kyushu. He was swept away in strong waves while trying to swim 
ashore after securing his boat, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The circumstances of the remaining deaths were unclear.  
</P>
<P>
	The storm injured at least 458 people, and two people were  
reported missing, police said.

<HEADLINE>  Typhoon in Japan Kills 26 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Typhoon Bart lashed Japan on Friday with driving  
rains and winds that shattered glass windows, downed power lines, 
knocked over cranes and killed at least 26 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's northern island of Hokkaido braced for the storm, which  
was traveling northeast over the ocean off the western coast of 
Japan. Packing winds of up to 78 mph and moving at 40 mph, Bart was 
expected to hit Hokkaido early Saturday, the Meteorological Agency 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, a tornado unrelated to the typhoon tore through a  
city in central Japan, slightly injuring 262 people, mostly 
schoolchildren hit by glass from shattered windows. The twister 
swept through Toyohashi, 140 miles west of Tokyo, for about 30 
minutes Friday morning, destroying three homes and damaging dozens 
of others. 
</P>
<P>
	Bart wreaked havoc on southern Japan. On the island of Kyushu,  
the bodies of 14 people -- including two elderly women -- were 
recovered from homes submerged by high sea waves in Shiranui, a 
coastal town in Kumamoto prefecture, 560 miles southwest of Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in Kumamoto, a 79-year-old man was found dead of electric  
shock from a power line that had fallen onto a street. A 
50-year-old man died from blood loss after he was hit by broken 
glass in his home, police spokesman Shigeji Tominaga said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hiroshima, 430 miles southwest of Tokyo, two factory cranes  
toppled by strong winds crashed on a building, killing three 
workers and injuring one, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	A 50-year-old man died Thursday as the typhoon approached  
Kyushu. He was swept away in strong waves while trying to swim 
ashore after securing his boat, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The circumstances of the remaining deaths were unclear.  
</P>
<P>
	The storm injured at least 458 people, and two people were  
reported missing, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Police Agency said 245 landslides were reported, 22  
homes were totally destroyed and more than 4,000 homes were 
flooded. 
</P>
<P>
	Most domestic air flights and trains on Kyushu were either

<HEADLINE> Bush to Buchanan: Stay With GOP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Recalling his father's 1992 defeat in a  
three-way race, George W. Bush on Friday urged Pat Buchanan to 
remain a Republican and not bolt to a Reform Party presidential 
bid. ``I need every vote I can get'' to win the White House, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, the GOP presidential  
front-runner also said he supports raising the federal minimum wage 
by $1 an hour but only if states can opt out -- a condition that 
could render a proposed increase meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
	Discussing a range of foreign policy issues, Bush said he had  
the will to force United Nations weapons inspectors back into Iraq, 
and he sided with supporters of the troubled F-22 stealth fighter. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-term Texas governor spoke with typical bravado about  
politics -- ``I think I'm going to be president'' -- but seemed 
unusually guarded and brusque about policy questions, fending off 
requests for details. Voters will find him ``filling in the blanks 
on policy'' on his own timetable, Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 30-minute roundtable with AP editors and reporters, Bush  
said: 
</P>
<P>
	--China is among the potential threats that require a strong U.S.  
military. Calling U.S.-China ties ``a competitive relationship,'' 
Bush said, ``I see nothing on the horizon, no talks about war right 
now, but it is a major issue'' for the next president. 
</P>
<P>
	--Congress should adhere to spending limits in the 1997  
balanced-budget deal. GOP leaders say they will exceed the limits, 
and the Congressional Budget Office says lawmakers are already on 
course to spend part of the Social Security surplus. One day after 
Clinton vetoed the GOP tax-cutting bill, Bush said he won't offer 
his own tax reduction package until ``after the dust has cleared 
here in Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--The Census should be ``an actual count,'' not conducted with  
statistical sampling methods. Minority groups being courted by Bush 
argue that traditional head counts underestimate their numbers, 
which dilutes their political clout. 
</P>
<P>
	On Buchanan, Bush said he disagreed with the conservative  
commentator's view that Nazi Germany wasn't a threat to the United 
States after 1940. He didn't join his GOP rivals in attacking 
Buchanan for expressing the viewpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, a three-time presidential candidate, is on the brink  
of dropping out of the GOP race to seek the Reform Party 
nomination. Republicans worry Buchanan could siphon votes from the 
GOP nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want Pat Buchanan to leave the party,'' Bush said. ``I  
think it's important, should I be the nominee, to unite the 
Republican Party. I'm going to need every vote I can get among 
Republicans to win the election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Buchanan ``inflicted a few'' wounds to his father's  
re-election campaign with a strong showing in the 1992 New 
Hampshire primary. And he agreed that Reform Party founder Ross 
Perot's general election campaign impacted the 1992 race, which 
ended his father's presidency. Perot drew 19 percent, Bush 37 
percent, and Bill Clinton won with 43 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the younger Bush refused to speculate about Buchanan's  
impact in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's too early to judge,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, aides said Bush was not expressing concern that  
Buchanan would hurt him in the general election. In the states that 
matter most to Bush, the campaign believes Buchanan's vote count 
would not tip the scales against the governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said his minimum wage proposal, though not fully formed,  
would give states unconditional ability to bypass the federally set 
wage. States would not be able to opt out of minimum wage levels 
already in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Of several measures pending in Congress, Bush said, ``My worry  
about the minimum wage is that if it's applied universally it's 
going to price certain people out of the job market.'' Bush also 
said he had not spoken to GOP leaders in the Senate or House about 
taxes or any other issues pending in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	As president, he would maintain a U.S. military presence near by  
Iraq and use ``good diplomacy'' to return weapons inspectors to the 
rogue nation, Bush said. Asked how his policy would differ from 
Clinton's, Bush said he has ``the will to try to get weapons 
inspectors back in Iraq.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defending the F-22 while some GOP lawmakers try to cut the  
plane, Bush said six F-22s should be funded while the Pentagon 
determines whether the Texas-built planes are needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he addressed a wide-range of topics over 30-minutes, Bush  
repeatedly brushed off follow-up questions that sought to pin him 
down. One exchange involved abortion and his belief that judges 
should be ``strict constructionists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His father used the same term to describe David H. Souter when  
he nominated him to the Supreme Court, and now many Republicans 
believe Souter's record is not conservative enough. Asked if Souter 
is a strict constructionist, Bush said, ``I'm not going to 
criticize any of the judges my dad named'' and said he hadn't 
watched Souter's record. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush firmly dismissed a question about whether his twin  
17-year-old daughters might want to talk to Chelsea Clinton about 
life in the White House. ``I don't want my daughters to be part of 
the public arena,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Stations Turn to Web Broadcasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- This past summer, if you were a baseball fan in  
search of Florida Marlins' highlights, you might tune in to WPEC's 
11 p.m. newscast -- or log on to its Web site to watch a simulcast. 
</P>
<P>
	Not anymore. Major League Baseball has cried ``Foul!'' -- and  
copyright infringement -- forcing the station in West Palm Beach, 
Fla., and others around the country to stop broadcasting on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Disputes over Internet programming rights, though still rare,  
are on the rise as more radio and TV stations run their 
over-the-air feeds on the Web as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is technology is always way ahead of the law,''  
said Kathleen Kirby, a lawyer for the Radio-Television News 
Directors Association, a Washington-based industry group. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet broadcasts generally mirror those sent over the  
airwaves, so some stations do not see the need for additional 
rights. But distributors of sports and entertainment programming 
say their contracts spell out permitted uses and automatically 
prohibit everything else. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball contracts go a step further and include a clause that  
specifically bans Internet broadcasts, even Internet broadcasts of 
highlights. The baseball league found several violators, and 
lawyers stopped the Web broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's starting to come up this season,'' said Michael Mellis,  
new media counsel for Major League Baseball Enterprises, the 
licensing division. ``Our game footage is copyrighted, and our 
intellectual property is valuable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	WPEC, which started Web simulcasts of local news shows on June  
21, has since eliminated its entire sports segment from the Web 
version. The station also disabled the Internet archives of past 
news shows because they contain baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, it's no different than re-broadcasting your news on  
cable,'' said Doreen Wade, WPEC's general manager. ``I don't see 
what the big deal is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A sister station, WWMT in Kalamazoo, Mich., initially stopped  
running baseball highlights on its over-the-air newscasts after 
learning of the Internet restriction. The station has since 
restored baseball to regular broadcast but keeps footage off the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really surprised that it became an issue because it's not  
a revenue-driven thing at all here,'' said Al Forist, the station's 
operations manager. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Web service costs more money than it generates, so  
WWMT does not want to pay for separate rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Football League currently permits Web simulcasts of  
highlights for one-time usage but prohibits video broadcasts of 
entire games on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro basketball officials found a few radio stations that carried  
live feeds of games over the Internet but the stations stopped 
after they were contacted by the National Basketball Association. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Adam Silver, president of NBA Entertainment, said given  
the scope of the Internet, ``it's so difficult to police.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Restrictions extend to non-sports programming as well.  
</P>
<P>
	Premiere Radio Networks, a syndicator of radio programming,  
allows Web simulcasts for some shows, but not for lucrative 
holdings such as Rush Limbaugh and Dr. Laura Schlessinger. Premiere 
worked out a licensing agreement with broadcast.com, a site through 
which stations offer simulcasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Radio feeds through broadcast.com began in 1995. The site now  
has programming from 500 radio and 65 TV stations. Yahoo! Inc., 
which runs the site, expects continued growth as better technology 
makes quality feeds possible. 
</P>
<P>
	The company routinely checks with stations to make sure they  
have the proper rights. Difficulties primarily arise, Yahoo! Vice 
President Kevin Parke said, when the contract says nothing on the 
scope of the rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's a question, we try to go ahead and work with the  
rights holder,'' Parke said. ``The last thing we want to do is 
violate anyone's copyright.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Wharton, spokesman for the Washington-based National  
Association of Broadcasters, said broadcasters are sorting through 
the legal ramifications. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a brave new world we're entering.''

<HEADLINE> Democrats Keep Raising 'Soft Money' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Democratic Party has nearly doubled its  
``soft money'' fund raising this year even as party leaders push 
for a ban on these big donations from unions, corporations and 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic committees took in $26.4 million in unlimited soft  
money contributions in the first half of this year, up from $13.7 
million during the last comparable period, the first six months of 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think it shows the hypocrisy,'' said Marit Babin, a  
spokeswoman for the National Republican Congressional Committee. 
``They think it's a good campaign issue, yet they haven't turned 
down any checks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans raised even more soft money -- $30.9 million during  
the first six months of the year, a 42 percent increase over 1997, 
when they raised $21.7 million. Most congressional Republicans 
oppose the soft money ban, however. 
</P>
<P>
	At a closed-door meeting of the House GOP in August, Republican  
Chairman Jim Nicholson and NRCC Chairman Thomas Davis of Virginia 
argued that a ban on soft money would leave the party's candidates 
vulnerable to unlimited expenditures by labor unions and other 
groups that back Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican-controlled House approved a ban on soft money,  
nonetheless, in a 252-177 vote Sept. 14. Of 210 Democrats, 197 
voted for the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats say they can't afford to give up soft money while  
the Republicans are still raking it in. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we should make it illegal, but we should make it  
illegal for everyone,'' said Rep. Martin Meehan of Massachusetts, 
the lead Democratic sponsor of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Simon, executive vice president of Common Cause, a group  
advocating for campaign reform, said it doesn't bother him that the 
Democrats continue to raise soft money while calling for its 
abolition. 
</P>
<P>
	``This issue should not be played for partisan advantage by one  
side or another,'' Simon said. ``There needs to be a law banning 
soft money that applies to both parties. Voluntary limits tend not 
to work because one party or the other always feels aggrieved by 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parties can raise soft money for get-out-the-vote drives and  
other party-building activities. Since the money is not raised 
under federal rules, it cannot be used to directly help elect 
candidates. Increasingly, however, the Democrats and Republicans 
spend millions of dollars of soft money on issue advertisements 
designed to help their nominees without specifically urging a vote 
for or against a particular candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee more than  
quadrupled its soft money contributions over the first half of 1997 
-- nearly closing a historic gap with its Republican counterpart. 
The DCCC took in $9 million during the first six months of 1999, 
compared with $1.9 million during the same period two years 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Republican Congressional Committee took in $9.4  
million in soft money during the first six months of 1999, a 79 
percent increase over the same period in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	DCCC Chairman Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island said his committee  
has been making two pitches to potential donors, criticizing House 
Republican policies and arguing that the Democrats will recapture 
the majority next fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to be back in the majority. Are you going to be  
with us or not?'' Kennedy said he tells prospective contributors. 
``All we need to do is get a fraction of what these people are 
giving to Republicans. They don't want the balance sheets to be so 
unbalanced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, he said prospective soft money donors agree that the  
contributions should be prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people we're raising money from are just as interested in  
anyone else in not being hit up for these large checks,'' Kennedy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also topped Democrats in raising money under federal  
contribution limits. GOP committees took in $66.4 million, compared 
with $38.1 million for the Democrats.

<HEADLINE> Treasury Sec. Facing First Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawrence Summers, Robert Rubin's brainy  
understudy, is facing his first real tests as treasury secretary. A 
dollar weakening against the Japanese yen is roiling Wall Street 
and a widening Russian corruption scandal has Republicans looking 
for scapegoats. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, he is weathering the storms, facing down critics of the  
administration's Russia policies as the lead-off witness at 
congressional hearings and keeping the pressure on Japan to get its 
economic house in order. 
</P>
<P>
	The pudgy, boyish-looking Summers, 44, whose suits were once  
described in a New Yorker magazine profile as looking like they had 
``spent the day wrapped around a mating seal,'' certainly does not 
present the same style and flair as the ever-trim and unflappable 
Rubin, 61, whom he succeeded on July 2. 
</P>
<P>
	But in terms of policy, analysts say the youngest tenured  
professor in Harvard's history stacks up very well against Rubin, 
the savvy veteran of 26 years on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``Summers may not be a Rubin. But he is a perfectly adequate  
Summers,'' said Everett Ehrlich, a former top Clinton 
administration economist and now head of a Washington consulting 
firm. ``Few people have Rubin's charm, but few people have Summers' 
understanding of how the world economy works.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, while Rubin was the seasoned front man chosen to walk  
down the Treasury steps and deliver words of assurance on bad 
market days, it was Summers working behind the scenes as Rubin's 
top deputy who was the architect of much of the policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin and President Clinton both relied on Summers' advice to  
craft administration responses to a string of foreign economic 
crises, from the meltdown of the Mexican peso in 1995 to the 
cascading collapse of Asian currencies over the past two years and 
the dark days of last fall when Russia's troubles looked as if they 
might drag the whole world into recession. 
</P>
<P>
	After recent allegations of massive money laundering in Russia  
brought cries of outrage from Republicans in Congress, it was 
Summers who marched to Capitol Hill to defend the administration's 
actions in supporting billions of dollars of Western support to 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	``To quarantine, contain or write off Russia as too corrupt  
would ill serve our national interest,'' Summers told Congress 
while at the same time promising that the administration will move 
swiftly to crack down on any illegal activities uncovered by the 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, as the dollar fell to its lowest levels against  
the Japanese yen in more than three years, Summers has repeated 
virtually word-for-word the same response Rubin always gave to 
currency questions -- ``A strong dollar is in the national interest 
of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But repeating the Rubin mantra so far has not halted the  
dollar's slide. And as the American currency tumbles further, it 
has raised concerns about inflation threats coming from higher 
prices for imported goods and possibly a stock market collapse if 
foreigners panic and cash in their sizable holdings of U.S. stocks 
and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell another 32  
points, ending a dismal week in which stocks fell by 524 points and 
now stand 1,047 points below their record close on Aug. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan is also worried about the yen's strength against the  
dollar, fearing it could derail Japan's fledgling recovery by 
cutting into exports. Japanese officials had been hoping that the 
Group of Seven finance ministers meeting on Saturday would support 
a coordinated government intervention effort to buy dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	But Summers has let it be known going into those sessions that  
Japan should be worrying less about its currency's appreciation and 
focus more on stimulating domestic demand to make sure it doesn't 
topple back into recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Private economists generally applaud Summers for this stance,  
saying government intervention has little long-lasting effect on a 
currency's value. 
</P>
<P>
	``Summers is absolutely correct. We want a strong dollar but we  
want to achieve it through focusing on getting the economic 
fundamentals right,'' said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells 
Fargo in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	And a weaker dollar, while posing a risk of higher inflation,  
could end up helping the U.S. economy by narrowing America's record 
trade deficit as U.S. exporters gain competitive advantages 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts also caution that there could be more bumpy days  
ahead for the U.S. stock market as investors watch to see how much 
farther the dollar may have to fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think currency speculators are going to do some more testing  
to try to find out just how far down they can push the dollar,'' 
said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co. in New 
York.

<HEADLINE> Rookie Montoya Close to CART Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Paul Tracy is the longest of long shot contenders  
heading into the Texaco Grand Prix of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old Canadian driver is third in the CART FedEx  
Series standings. To win the title this season, he would have to 
score the maximum 66 points in the final three races of the season 
-- sweeping the pole, leading the most laps and winning at each of 
those events -- while series leader Juan Montoya went scoreless. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tracy isn't concerned about that. Right now, he's just happy  
to be on a team that's involved in the championship chase this late 
in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, not only is Tracy still in contention, but Team Kool  
Green teammate Dario Franchitti is second in the standings, 
trailing Montoya by 28 points heading into today's opening of 
practice and qualifying for Sunday's race. 
</P>
<P>
	``What a difference a year makes,'' said Tracy, who struggled  
through a miserable 1998 season that included an embarrassing 
incident during the inaugural Houston race. 
</P>
<P>
	The teammates were running 1-2 midway through the rain-soaked  
race when Tracy tried an inadvisable pass on Franchitti. The cars 
banged together and Tracy was knocked out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Franchitti was able to continue and wound up winning the  
rain-shortened race after leading each of the 70 laps on the 
1.527-mile temporary street circuit winding around Houston's 
downtown convention center. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, he has posted four of his five career victories on  
temporary street circuits. That includes wins earlier this year in 
Toronto and Detroit, races in which Tracy finished second. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're the dominant team on street courses, which certainly  
gives us a lot of confidence going into Houston,'' Tracy said. 
``Dario and I have run real close on the streets this year, but 
we'll try to avoid getting as close in Houston as we did last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody remembers who Dario and I made contact. We're both  
fierce competitors and neither of us wanted to give ground that 
day. It was a mistake and an unfortunate thing to have happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To make matters worse, Tracy and team owner Barry Green got into  
a momentary shoving match after the driver returned to the pits. 
But both brushed shrugged off the incident as simply a 
heat-of-the-moment thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barry and I are fine. We never have had a harsh word about  
anything on the track,'' Tracy said. ``Sometimes, these things just 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franchitti remembers last year's race very clearly.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very interesting race, to say the least,'' the  
26-year-old Scotsman said. ``The incident with the two cars 
touching stirred it up a bit, but there's no problem between Paul 
and myself. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is we have equally fast cars and we are both capable  
of winning. It's only natural that at some point in a race, we'll 
find ourselves trying to pass each other. We just need to use our 
heads in doing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franchitti certainly cannot afford to have any kind of incident  
as he chases Montoya, the sensational 23-year-old Colombian rookie. 
</P>
<P>
	Montoya has taken the CART series by storm, driving to six poles  
and seven wins in his first 17 races. With only two events left 
after Sunday, Montoya could wrap up the title this week. 
</P>
<P>
	If he comes away with a 44-point lead, the elite Target/Chip  
Ganassi Racing team will have a record fourth consecutive series 
championship -- added to those won by Jimmy Vasser and two-time 
champ Alex Zanardi, Montoya's predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
	Some youngsters might feel pressured in this situation, but  
Montoya appears totally comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kid has nerves of steel,'' Vasser said. ``Maybe someone  
should remind him that he's 23 and on the brink of winning a PPG 
Cup. He really has the right attitude. He hasn't changed a thing 
about how he's approaching races.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley's Civil Rights Plan Rebuked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Bradley's suggestion that the 1964 Civil  
Rights Act be expanded to include sexual orientation drew a rebuke 
Friday from the head of the Democratic National Committee's black 
caucus, who called the suggestion ``ill-advised.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas state Rep. Al Edwards of Houston, head of the DNC caucus,  
asked the party's executive committee to pass a resolution against 
reopening the 1964 law and they did so unanimously late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The DNC would urge that the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which is  
the benchmark for all other civil rights bills, not be reopened for 
debate or amendments that diminish its existing protections,'' the 
resolution said. 
</P>
<P>
	The full Democratic National Committee, which includes many  
supporters of Vice President Al Gore, could consider the resolution 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley is waging an insurgent's challenge to Gore for the 2000  
presidential nomination. On gay rights, Gore supports the narrower 
-- more achievable, he says -- Employment Non-Discrimination Act, or 
ENDA, pending in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Hauser, a spokesman for Bradley, said the measure was not  
at odds with Bradley's position because the former New Jersey 
senator doesn't favor any changes that would diminish the law's 
``existing protections.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My commitment to the Civil Rights Act will never waver''  
Bradley said. ``As president, I would never sign any law that would 
weaken that act and would use every tool at my disposal to advance 
racial harmony and justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said that during the 1980s ``courageous Democrats sought  
to broaden the protections of the Civil Rights Act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Edwards suggested that any protections for gays and lesbians  
should be handled in separate legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics warn that opening that law to amendment now would give  
the Republican-led Congress a chance to gut its protections against 
racial, gender and religious discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Party leaders also said Friday that Democrats have an edge over  
Republicans on and that the party has been successful at erasing 
its debts from past years. 
</P>
<P>
	During an afternoon meeting, the party's rules panel:  
</P>
<P>
	--Denied South Carolina's request to have its primary on Feb. 19,  
the same day as the Republican primary, rather than later. South 
Carolina party officials pleaded for the change, saying that 
sharing the early date with Republicans would dramatically reduce 
expenses and keep the party more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	--Told Arizona Democrats their plans to allow Internet voting  
from home in that state's primary were not a problem for the DNC if 
they made Internet voting an additional option to absentee voting 
by mail, and not a replacement.

<HEADLINE> Two German Jets Collide Over N.M. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, N.M. (AP) -- Two German air force jets collided Friday  
over southeastern New Mexico, but the four pilots ejected safely 
and parachuted to the ground near a ranch. 
</P>
<P>
	Ande Marbach of the Kincaid Ranch said she heard the collision  
and called for help when she saw some of the pilots parachuting 
down. They appeared to be in good shape, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounded like when they break the sound barrier,'' she said.  
``I saw smoke from where the planes hit and saw two of them come 
down. They just asked to call the ambulance and call Holloman,'' 
the south-central New Mexico air base where German pilots have been 
based for several years. 
</P>
<P>
	Holloman Air Force Base said the men were being taken to a  
hospital in Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident, involving two European-made Tornado aircraft  
belonging to the German air force, happened shortly before 3 p.m., 
said state police Sgt. Rick Anglada. 
</P>
<P>
	The German Luftwaffe has trained its pilots at Holloman for  
years, and its Flying Training Center there currently has about 580 
military personnel and about 25 Tornado airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash happened about 100 miles southeast of Holloman.

<HEADLINE> Bob Barker To Leave Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Less than a week after surgery to clear a  
blocked artery, game show host Bob Barker plans to go home to 
California, his publicist said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Barker was scheduled to check out of George Washington  
University Hospital on Saturday, Henri Bollinger said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Barker underwent surgery on Monday to clear an artery in his  
neck that was impeding the flow of blood to his brain. He was 
admitted Sept. 16 to the hospital for fatigue. Tests later revealed 
his left carotid artery was 85 percent blocked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Barker is experiencing a good recovery from surgery and  
will now need to go home and rest,'' his neurosurgeon, Anthony 
Caputy, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	A longtime animal rights activist, Barker, 75, was in Washington  
to lobby for a bill that would ban circuses from using elephants. 
</P>
<P>
	His illness is not expected to interfere with production of  
``The Price Is Right'' because the show is taped well in advance. 
Barker has been host of the program since 1972.

<HEADLINE> Ventura at Odds With Nevada Brothel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Gov. Jesse Ventura doesn't want a Nevada  
brothel making money off The Body. 
</P>
<P>
	The Moonlight Bunny Ranch near Carson City has designated one  
room the Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura Suite and has produced signs 
and leaflets that put Ventura's name next to the phrase: ``I had 
sex at the Moonlight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura has denied ever saying those words, and he had his  
lawyer send a cease-and-desist letter threatening legal action 
against the brothel owner, Dennis Hof, for implying the governor 
endorses the establishment. 
</P>
<P>
	The advertisements were prompted by Ventura's oft-repeated boast  
that he was ``one of the only men standing on the Earth who can say 
he went to a Nevada ranch and was paid for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a story recounted in his autobiography, ``I Ain't Got Time to  
Bleed,'' Ventura claimed that sometime in the 1970s, when he was a 
Navy SEAL, he visited the legal brothel, where a prostitute admired 
his belt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `Make me an offer.' And she said, `How about a trick  
and $10?''' he said, retelling the story during his book tour. ``I 
did it!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hof said he will change the name of the Ventura suite to the  
Governor's Suite (and decorate it with Ventura posters, Navy SEAL 
regalia and feather boas, which were Ventura's trademark). And he 
said he will change the ad to more closely reflect what the 
governor said in his book. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hof angrily noted that the governor often bragged about the  
ranch for his purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's selling sensationalism. That's how he's selling his  
book,'' Hof said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hof, who once hired John Wayne Bobbitt to work at the brothel,  
also said he is trying to find the prostitute Ventura patronized, 
and plans to promote her to talk shows and tabloids.

<HEADLINE> SEC Supports Stock Market Overseer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman  
Arthur Levitt said he would support creation of a single, 
independent agency to police the nation's stock markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In speech delivered at Columbia University on Thursday night,  
Levitt gave mild support to a plan in which each exchange would 
police its own trading, but an umbrella agency would monitor member 
activities, sales practices and trading between the various 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I certainly am not wedded to any particular model at  
this point -- a great deal more thinking needs to be done -- this 
latter approach is intriguing,'' Levitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of a single, independent agency has been gaining steam  
amid a proliferation of smaller alternative markets and the 
likelihood that the self-regulating New York Stock Exchange and 
Nasdaq Stock Market may change into for-profit businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Competition from new ECNs, or electronic communications  
networks, has pressured more traditional, non-for-profit exchanges 
like the NYSE and Nasdaq to consider selling stock to the public to 
raise money and allow for greater flexibility in their operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Both, however, would need SEC approval for changes to their  
business or regulatory units. And concerns have been raised that 
the NYSE's and Nasdaq's regulatory units would face endless 
conflicts of interest if the two exchanges became profit-driven 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how that would change the SEC's role, Levitt said the  
agency would act not as an enforcer, but rather as a sort of 
arbitrator, getting the various exchanges to remove 
anti-competitive practices and put in place measures that protect 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt said the new ECNs provide needed competition in the  
markets, calling them ``one of the most important developments in 
our markets in years -- perhaps decades.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the SEC chairman also said the growing rivalry among markets  
has heightened the need to find a compromise between the benefits 
of competition and the problems created by fragmented markets, 
which can make it hard for investors to obtain information and find 
the best stock price. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the securities industry also expressed support  
Thursday for an umbrella regulatory body. 
</P>
<P>
	``The securities industry would like to see one regulator for  
the entire industry,'' said Bernard Madoff, president of Madoff 
Securities in New York, asserting that the SEC would need to ensure 
that such a body remains independent from any of the dozen or so 
stock markets now operating in this country. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading firms such as Madoff's would save money under a single  
regulatory body because they are currently required to help pay 
regulatory costs at each of the exchanges where they are members. 
</P>
<P>
	Madoff said the industry needs Levitt's leadership on the issue  
because neither the NYSE or the Nasdaq has provided any details on 
how they plan to police their markets should they become for-profit 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Some were critical of Levitt Thursday for not moving fast enough  
to address the rapid changes washing over the markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been way behind the curve on this,'' said Junius Peake,  
an economics professor at the University of Northern Colorado and a 
former member of the board of governors at the National Association 
of Securities Dealers, which oversees the Nasdaq market. 
</P>
<P>
	Peake said support for a single, independent regulator has been  
building for 25 years. Such an agency should regulate any aspect of 
an exchange that produces income because, ``That's where everybody 
gets caught up and everybody has a terrible time staying neutral.''

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Bank Execs Face Penalties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Parliament recommended Friday the  
suspension of some of Indonesia's leading financial officials in a 
banking scandal that has implicated some of President B.J. 
Habibie's associates. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal involves the channeling of government funds through  
Bank Bali, allegedly for Habibie's re-election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Habibie vowed that he would not block any investigations into  
the case, even if they led to prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let the court proceed with the case. I have no plans or  
intentions to hamper the process,'' he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	A special parliamentary investigation team said that Habibie  
should suspend Finance Minister Bambang Subianto, Bank Indonesia 
Governor Sjahril Sabirin and the entire board of governors of the 
central bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Habibie ``should take immediate legal action against government  
officials who are strongly suspected of being involved, directly or 
indirectly'' in the Bank Bali scandal, the team said in a report. 
They should be suspended pending court verdicts, the report added. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have ordered a thorough investigation of anybody who was  
allegedly involved in the case,'' Habibie said Friday in a speech 
to members of parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Parliament also recommended the suspension of senior Habibie  
adviser A.A. Baramuli, former Bank Bali chief executive Rudy Ramli, 
and a number of other officials and executives. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers said the scandal was tarnishing Indonesia's image  
abroad, and called for a complete resolution of the case within one 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank Bali scandal centers around the transfer of $105  
million to Bank Bali as repayment for funds owed by a closed bank, 
under a government guarantee program. 
</P>
<P>
	Of this, $63 million was then transferred to a company  
controlled a senior official in the ruling Golkar party. 
</P>
<P>
	Golkar opponents claim the funds were meant to finance Habibie's  
re-election campaign. The election, to be conducted by an assembly 
of legislators and government appointees, is set for November. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal threatens to derail International Monetary Fund,  
World Bank and Asian Development Bank loans meant to help Indonesia 
emerge from economic turmoil. Private investors have also been 
spooked by the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has refused to publish a PriceWaterhouseCoopers  
investigation into the case, saying that banking security laws 
prevent it from being made public. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus on Thursday said  
Indonesia should publish the audit if it wants the IMF to consider 
resuming aid.

<HEADLINE> Timber Bill Makes Congressional Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A proposal that would sharply boost federal  
timber payments to counties and encourage the Forest Service to cut 
more trees cleared its first hurdle Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Agriculture Committee unanimously approved a bill by  
Rep. Nathan Deal, R-Ga., that would continue to give counties 25 
percent of forest revenues -- mostly logging receipts -- that come 
from federal land within counties' borders. 
</P>
<P>
	But Deal's bill requires the Forest Service to pay counties from  
the agency's budget when timber harvests fall below the average of 
the three peak years since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a recognition... the revenue stream has been  
substantially declining,'' Deal said. 
</P>
<P>
	As logging on federal land has declined 70 percent in the last  
decade, average payments to many rural counties have fallen by an 
equal percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop has forced some rural schools to lay off workers,  
reduce class offerings and delay equipment purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	The Deal bill boosts county payments by more than 80 percent to  
nearly $500 million. They would continue at that level for five 
years while an advisory group researches a long-term solution to 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management shipped about  
$273 million to about 800 counties in 41 states last year to pay 
for roads and schools in communities that have lost tax base to 
federal forest land. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 75 percent of the payments went to five states --  
Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho and Montana. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration officials have threatened to veto the  
Deal bill, saying it is time to end the 91-year practice of linking 
children's education with fluctuating timber harvests.

<HEADLINE> Ariz. Gov. Will Not Endorse McCain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Arizona Sen. John McCain said Friday his home  
state's governor, Jane Hull, told him she will endorse his rival 
for the Republican presidential nomination, Texas Gov. George W. 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain has been counting on Arizona's early Republican primary  
Feb. 22 to boost his chances three weeks later in California, where 
he is campaigning with life-or-death fervor. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said he spoke with Mrs. Hull by telephone earlier Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	Bush is scheduled to make his first campaign stop in Arizona  
Tuesday and a source close to his campaign confirmed that Mrs. Hull 
planned to use the visit to announce her endorsement. Aides to her 
would not deny those plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Officially, the governor has not made an endorsement,'' said  
Francie Noyes, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Hull. ``She does have a 
meeting with Gov. Bush.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said he was disappointed by Mrs. Hull's decision but  
remained confident he could carry his home state, where he recently 
won his third Senate term by a wide margin. 
</P>
<P>
	``I consider Jane a friend and I will naturally continue to work  
with her on behalf of the people of Arizona,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other seekers of the Republican presidential nomination next  
year also have wooed Mrs. Hull. Former Vice President Dan Quayle, 
who now lives in Arizona and publisher Steve Forbes have met with 
her seeking support. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona's early primary makes the state attractive for  
candidates needing a springboard and for the front-running Bush, 
who would like to lock up the GOP nomination without an expensive 
fight.

<HEADLINE> Up and Down Day for Free Web Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Even as investors gave the usual hero's welcome  
to the newest Internet stock, there were strong signs that the 
newcomer's main product -- free dial-up access to the Internet -- may 
not be the wave of the future after all. 
</P>
<P>
	NetZero's shares nearly doubled on Friday, the first day of  
trading after the free Web service's initial public offering of 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were apparently unfazed by news that Microsoft, which  
had considered giving away access to customers of its MSN service, 
is actually going the other way and raising its fee by $2 a month, 
to $21.95. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Microsoft's decision came amid increasing skepticism by  
analysts toward the free-Web trend. One problem, they say, is 
getting users to stick with a free service, which make money by 
parading a steady stream of advertisements across a user's screen. 
</P>
<P>
	Several early providers of free Web access, including Bigger.net  
and Tritium Networks, have died trying to make a profit. 
</P>
<P>
	``After doing further work on the 'free access' business model,  
we are also highly skeptical that it is economically viable,'' 
Merrill Lynch analyst Henry Blodget wrote in a report to investors 
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Laszlo, an analyst with the Jupiter Communications research  
firm, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``As people look more closely under the hood, the idea you can  
provide Internet access solely supported by advertising seems less 
and less like a winning proposition,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Underlying their skepticism is an obvious conclusion: Most  
people, including Internet users, don't like being bombarded with 
ads. More preferable are subtle advertisements such as paid Web 
links on the start-up pages for Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, for its part, is placing its bets on its for-fee  
service. Starting Oct. 5, MSN service will cost the same price 
charged by America Online, the No. 1 provider of Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the risks, analysts say companies are likely to continue  
to experiment with providing free access, particularly to consumers 
who are heavy users of goods and services. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Surfree.com introduced a service that lets customers  
cut their monthly bills by watching ads. Also in August, AltaVista 
decided to give away access to customers who click on a window of 
ads and Web links at least once an hour. Those who don't are 
disconnected. 
</P>
<P>
	NetZero's public offering was the latest test of enthusiasm for  
the trend, and investors appeared to embrace it, boosting the 
company's stock more than $13 to $29.12 1/2. Notably, the big gain 
came at the end of a week in which technology stocks have suffered 
punishing losses on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Fueling investor optimism are projections that the number of  
Internet users will swell from 63 million in 1998 to 177 million in 
2003, according to International Data Corp. That's a lot of 
eyeballs for advertisers' messages. 
</P>
<P>
	``My inclination is that NetZero will have a dramatic increase  
in advertising because it's free,'' said David Menlow, editor of 
IPO Frontline, a Millburn, N.J.-based newsletter for individual 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	But thus far, providers of free access have had mixed success in  
keeping customers, and most have yet to earn money. 
</P>
<P>
	NetZero, for instance, disclosed in a filing with federal  
regulators that it had signed up 1.68 million users -- but only 
about 890,000, or 53 percent, actively used the service. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeserve, an upstart pioneer of free Web access in Britain, has

posts its latest quarterly results next week. In fact, those losses 
come despite the fact that Internet access providers in Europe get 
to share in telephone revenues as subscribers dial up.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Discusses Gun Control Measure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- In a bid to curb civil wars, ethnic  
massacres and terrorism, the U.N. Security Council on Friday 
discussed an initiative by the U.N. chief to implement greater 
gun-control measures around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the first ministerial debate on small arms,  
council members called for new measures to discourage arms from 
reaching conflict zones and also called for effective 
implementation of arms embargoes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Small arms and light weapons are primary tools of violence in  
many conflicts taking place in the world,'' Annan told the council. 
</P>
<P>
	``The proliferation of small arms, ammunition and explosives has  
also aggravated the violence associated with terrorism and 
organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even in societies not beset by civil war, the easy  
availability of small arms has in many cases contributed to 
violence and political instability,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	With at least 200 million firearms are owned by American  
citizens, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced the 
United States would refrain from sellings arms to war zones not 
already covered by arms embargoes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We encourage other nations to establish and observe such  
moratoria,'' she said. ``We have passed laws making it illegal for 
traffickers subject to American law to broker illicit deals 
anywhere. We ask others to crack down on brokering as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	British Foreign Minister Robin Cook told the Council: ``It is a  
tribute ... that nuclear weapons have never been used for half a 
century, and that chemical weapons have rarely been used. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, over the same period the assault rifle has become the  
weapon of mass killing. ... Over the last decade alone, conflicts 
fought with only small arms have killed over 3 million people, 
mostly civilians,'' Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Five million dollars will buy approximately 20,000 assault  
rifles -- enough to equip the army of a medium-sized state,'' he 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministers met to discuss a report by Annan which recommended  
among other things: 
</P>
<P>
	--Better enforcement of U.N. arms embargoes on nations and  
regions in conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	--Nations should require arms manufacturers to put serial numbers  
and identification marks on weapons so the diversion of legitimate 
sales into the black market can be monitored. 
</P>
<P>
	--Nations should share information on the registration of guns  
and on legal transactions, in order to trace black market deals.

<HEADLINE> New System Finds Delinquent Parents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly 3 million parents owing child support  
have been found since last October using an automated system 
Congress mandated to help locate such people, the government said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the 1996 welfare overhaul, Congress required that  
state-supplied information on employees be matched against a 
federal database of individuals owing child support. The directory 
was one of several measures that lawmakers required states to adopt 
in an effort to increase child support collections. 
</P>
<P>
	The system helped find 2.8 million delinquent payers in fiscal  
1999, said Olivia Golden, assistant secretary for children and 
families at the Department of Health and Human Services. The figure 
was more than twice the 1.2 million parents located in fiscal 1998, 
the first year of the system, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	All 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and 146  
federal agencies report employment data to the national directory. 
Matches are reported back to the states, which automatically deduct 
payments from an individual's wages. 
</P>
<P>
	The department could not say how much child support had been  
collected from the 2.8 million people found since October. 
</P>
<P>
	Golden, who testified at a House Ways and Means subcommittee  
hearing on the child support enforcement program, said overall 
federal and state collections climbed to a record $14.3 billion in 
fiscal 1998 -- an increase of $6.3 billion since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of cases in which collections were made also  
increased, to 4.5 million last fiscal year, compared with 2.8 
million cases in 1992, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal database contains more than 12 million child support  
cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of fathers identified or acknowledging paternity also  
hit a high of 1.5 million last year -- almost three times the 1992 
figure of 512,000, Golden said. 
</P>
<P>
	A joint program with the State Department that denies U.S.  
passports to parents owing at least $5,000 in support has netted 
more than $2.2 million in lump sum payments since its June 1998 
launch, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	States also are being required to match delinquent parents  
against records from every financial institution operating within 
their borders. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials testifying before the human resources  
subcommittee praised the new measures. Lawmakers praised the 
effort, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Laura Kadwell, Minnesota's child support enforcement director  
and president-elect of the National Child Support Enforcement 
Association, said the employment database was increasing 
collections and getting money to children faster. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is encouraging to know that when we pass legislation ...  
something happens in people's lives,'' said Rep. Nancy Johnson, 
R-Conn., the panel's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala  
also announced that five states -- Colorado, Maryland, 
Massachusetts, Virginia and Washington -- several tribal and 
nonprofit groups and the University of New Hampshire will share 
more than $2.2 million in grants to test new ways of increasing 
collections.

<HEADLINE> AL Umpire Suspended Three Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball disciplined another umpire Friday when  
American League president Gene Budig suspended John Shulock for 
three games and fined him an undisclosed amount following a blowup 
in a game between Anaheim and Tampa Bay earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Budig, whose job is being eliminated by commissioner Bud Selig,  
acted because of Shulock's ``overly aggressive behavior, display of 
temper, inappropriate remarks and physical contact'' with Tampa Bay 
catcher Mike DeFelice on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Working behind the plate in the game at Anaheim, Shulock was  
struck in the mask in the third inning by a pitch from Tampa Bay's 
Wilson Alvarez that sailed past DeFelice. He thought he was hit 
deliberately and headed out for the mound to confront the pitcher. 
DeFelice intercepted him and Devil Rays manager Larry Rothschild 
came out of the dugout to protect his players. 
</P>
<P>
	An argument followed and Shulock apparently made contact with  
DeFelice as he yelled at Alvarez, who was not ejected but was 
removed from the game by Rothschild. After the game, won by Anaheim 
10-5, Shulock said he believed the pitcher had thrown at him on 
purpose and the catcher made no effort on the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more I think about it, I think he (Alvarez) did it  
intentionally,'' Shulock said. ``I can't prove it, but I'm upset, 
and I have a right to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shulock said the Devil Rays had been complaining about ball and  
strike calls during the game and he thought that was behind the 
pitch which struck him. 
</P>
<P>
	Alvarez, DeFelice and Rothschild all refused to discuss the  
matter before the Devil Rays played the New York Yankees on Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Shulock, who was working the Chicago-Minnesota game Friday  
night, also refused comment. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday night, Alvarez said there was no intent on the pitch.  
</P>
<P>
	``Mike called for a fastball away, and I threw one that went  
down the middle,'' he said. ``I wasn't trying to hit him. Those 
things happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shulock wasn't convinced.  
</P>
<P>
	``The catcher called for a curve, and he throws a fastball,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to call strikes on pitches that are outside just  
to make someone look good. If he can't throw strikes, it's not my 
fault. He had a bad night. I didn't. The only thing he could hit 
all night were the Angels' bats, and my mask. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that's the way he wants to be, what goes around comes  
around. He'll get his.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shulock is not a member of the umpires union. He was hired as a  
replacement umpire in 1979 when the regular umps struck major 
league baseball for seven weeks. Shulock was retained after the 
strike ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though he is not a member, the union said if he chose to  
file a grievance over the suspension, it would pursue the matter 
for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Budig said Shulock would not work the final three games of the  
season with his crew. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the season, National League umpire Tom Hallion was  
suspended for three games without pay for allegedly bumping 
Colorado catcher Jeff Reed and pitching coach Milt May. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Tata, working the game with Hallion, denied Hallion had  
made contact with Reed and May. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, baseball officials couldn't recall another  
suspension of an umpire for an on-field dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Hallion was one of 22 umpires whose resignations were accepted  
by baseball and who lost their jobs Sept. 2.

<HEADLINE> Unearthed Coffins Collected in N.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TARBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Coast Guardsmen plied the 20-foot  
floodwaters of eastern North Carolina on Friday, trying to snag 
scores of coffins that popped out of the ground after Hurricane 
Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, a team of funeral home directors will begin  
identifying the wayward caskets to help get them back to what were 
supposed to be their final resting places. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're doing this to ensure that all the caskets are identified  
so that we can notify their loved ones,'' said Coast Guard Lt. 
Scott Bates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard crews spent the day in Princeville, across the  
Tar River from Tarboro, trying to round up as many as 100 airtight 
caskets that was forced from the ground by the river's floodwaters. 
</P>
<P>
	Too heavy to pull onto boats, the caskets were either towed to  
shore or tied to trees as Coast Guard crews recorded their 
locations. All appeared to be sealed and intact. 
</P>
<P>
	The manufacturer's ID numbers on the caskets can be traced to  
funeral homes and ultimately the families who bought them, said 
Andrew Ritter, executive director of the North Carolina Board of 
Mortuary Science. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a terrible thing, but when you're talking about 4,000  
caskets in Edgecombe County and 100 pop up, it's bad that those 100 
popped up, but it's good that 3,900 others didn't,'' Ritter said. 
He said they posed no health risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Search crews, meanwhile, used dogs trained to detect bodies to  
look for victims of the floodwaters that swallowed Princeville, a 
town of 1,900, a week ago. At least 42 deaths have been blamed on 
Hurricane Floyd in eastern North Carolina alone, and the numbers 
could rise as floodwaters recede. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the river in downtown Tarboro, some business owners were  
finally able to get into their stores for the first time since 
floodwaters forced them to evacuate Sept. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Rex Browning, 66, remained upbeat as he cleaned up his jewelry  
store five blocks from the river. The paneling was wilted 4 feet up 
the wall, marking the floodwaters' high point. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started here 42 years ago with nothing, so I guess I have  
more than that now,'' Browning said as he examined broken watches. 
</P>
<P>
	A stench filled the air and some people wore masks over their  
mouths and noses. Murky water poured into the streets from whirring 
pumps emptying businesses. Wet carpeting, twisted furniture and 
other items littered the sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the day, dump trucks and other heavy construction  
equipment rumbled down the muddy streets. 
</P>
<P>
	Donna Webb's office supply store was open again, thanks to a  
4-foot-high concrete dam she had built a week ago in front of the 
place. ``It was almost as hard to tear down as it was to build,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a week after 20 inches of rain fell on parts of the  
state, emergency management officials said 2,700 people remained in 
24 shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	Utility crews have restored power to nearly all the 1.5 million  
people who lost electricity. But it could be at least two weeks 
before classes resume in all the school districts affected by the 
flooding. Eleven districts with about 176,000 students remained 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some cases the schools are OK, but the communities are  
gone,'' said Ben Matthews, state director of school support. ``In 
other cases, the community is all right, but the road to the school 
is washed out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a visit to Greenville, Gov. Jim Hunt pledged to find the  
money for repairs and improvements so the region isn't ravaged by 
flooding again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to fix up something and have it happen again two  
years from now,'' he said. ``This time, fix it right.''

<HEADLINE> Orioles Expect Ripken Back for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Showing the same grit that allowed him to play  
in 2,632 straight games, Cal Ripken played until the pain in his 
back became intolerable. 
</P>
<P>
	Only then did the Ripken give in.  
</P>
<P>
	The Baltimore Orioles third baseman had back surgery Thursday,  
ending his 1999 season nine hits short of 3,000, but giving 
baseball's Iron Man hope he can continue his career without pain. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital said in a statement that the 90-minute operation by  
orthopedic surgeon Dr. Henry Bohlman, director of University 
Hospitals' Spine Institute, accomplished its goal, ``to relieve 
pressure on the nerve roots located in Ripken's lower back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. Bohlman and Orioles team physician Dr. Michael Jacobs, who  
observed the surgery, said Ripken is expected to make a full 
recovery,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	University Hospitals spokeswoman Eileen Korey said Ripken  
requested that nothing further about the operation be released, and 
hospital officials had no updated information on Ripken's condition 
this morning. Korey did not know how long the infielder would stay 
in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking in Baltimore, general manager Frank Wren said he was  
optimistic Ripken would be back next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``From our standpoint, it went very well,'' Wren said. ``We  
expect a full recovery and expect to see him at third base on 
opening day 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 39-year-old Ripken was having one of his most personally  
fulfilling seasons before opting for the surgery he had tried to 
postpone until the winter. 
</P>
<P>
	He was batting .340, 64 points higher than his career average,  
and with nine more hits, Ripken would become the 24th player in 
history to reach 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	But the surgery ended his season and his chances of joining the  
3,000-hit club, which already welcomed Tony Gwynn and Wade Boggs 
this season. It would have been the first time three players 
reached the 3,000-hit milestone in the same season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, we're hoping for a speedy recovery,'' Orioles  
shortstop Mike Bordick said Thursday at Camden Yards. ``Health 
takes priority over the game. It's too bad because he had played so 
great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, who holds the major league record by playing in 2,632  
straight games, went on the disabled list for the first time in his 
18-year career this season. 
</P>
<P>
	He first went on the DL on April 20 because of a bad back,  
missing three weeks and was again sidelined after experiencing more 
back pain Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	But after sitting out for a month, he came off the DL on Sept.  
1, and in his second game back hit his 400th career homer. His 
swing looked like it did in his 1983 and '91 MVP seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	But even though Ripken had been playing well, the pain in his  
back never subsided and he finally decided this week that surgery 
was his only option. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgery ended a bittersweet and emotional '99 season for  
Ripken, whose father, Cal, died of lung cancer in March. His 
father's death weighed heavily on Ripken, who said he had trouble 
concentrating in the ensuing weeks, especially at the ballpark 
where the senior Ripken coached and managed the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to meet a lot of professional and personal challenges,''  
he said last week. ``When you look back, will it be a season to 
remember? I guess in some ways it would be, but for the most part, 
it represents something of a loss as well as something of a gain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken voluntarily ended his consecutive games streak on Sept.  
20, 1998, asking Miller to take him out of the lineup 30 minutes 
before a game against New York. A two-time AL MVP, Ripken played in 
his 17th straight All-Star game this year.

<HEADLINE> NASA Station May Go to Private Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- NASA is willing to turn over operation of the  
new international space station to private enterprise, perhaps 
within the next decade, space agency Administrator Daniel Goldin 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldin told members of the Space Frontier Foundation that  
private control of the station would allow NASA to concentrate on 
its preferred mission of exploring the solar system. 
</P>
<P>
	In an age of shrinking budgets NASA can no longer afford to  
manage orbiting operations, such as the space station now under 
construction, and also reach out to explore the planets, Goldin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	After five or 10 years of steady operation, NASA would be  
willing to let private industry operate the station, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our hope is to turn the keys of the station over to an  
entrepreneur, if the private sector sees opportunity'' Goldin said. 
``The government would become just one of many tenants and users of 
the station. The entrepreneurs could make money as we wave good-bye 
to low-earth orbit to explore the far frontier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview following his speech, Goldin said any private  
company that wants the job must demonstrate that it has the 
necessary expertise and financial clout necessary for such an 
undertaking. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've made the offer,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Goldin spoke to about 400 engineers, scientists and aspiring  
space entrepreneurs attending the foundation's annual conference. 
The group is among several private organizations that has been 
lobbying the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and 
Congress for greater opportunity for private companies to pursue 
commercial ventures in space. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our NASA people want to design missions that open up the space  
frontier. They don't want to sit holding the hands of customers, 
watching dials and turning knobs,'' Goldin said. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, space exploration was considered the exclusive domain  
of NASA and a few big contractors such as Boeing Co. and Lockheed 
Martin Corp. that built spacecraft and provided services to the 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	That has changed in recent years as the demand for commercial  
satellite launches have far exceeded NASA's launch capability. 
French, Russian and Chinese entitites have become strong 
competitors in the launch market. U.S. aerospace companies are 
working to develop inexpensive launch vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the satellite market has softened in recent months, it  
is expected to remain a key aerospace market. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of turning the station entirely over to private  
management goes far beyond a plan NASA has adopted that would allow 
private companies to share the space station. Goldin said the 
existing plan would make 30 percent or more of the station 
available to companies while NASA retains control. Several 
companies have submitted proposals that are under study. Goldin 
declined to name them or describe their proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a chance for the private sector to own a piece of the  
rock, make money from it and show there is life in the commercial 
sector, not just talk,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the conference attendees represented small startup  
companies trying to attract venture capital for low-cost launch 
vehicles or communications ventures. Many have complained in the 
past that NASA's vision of space commercialization was limited to 
big companies such as Boeing, said Rick Tumlinson, the foundation's 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Goldin's remarks came as a welcome surprise, he  
said. The group has argued for several years for creation of a 
quasi-public agency, such as the port authorities that control the 
nation's harbors, to operate the space station. 
</P>
<P>
	Sessions at the three-day convention dealt with potential space  
ventures ranging from space tourism to asteroid mining. But some 
who attended had more practical ventures in mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many at the conference, Gregory Allison, president of High  
Altitude Research Corp., dreams of the day when tourists will board 
spaceships for vacations in orbit or to the moon. But for now, his 
company is focused on providing cheap launch services for small 
communications satellites and university research projects. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, based in Huntsville, Ala., has had two paying  
customers so far, including NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
	The company uses balloons to launch small rockets from an  
altitude of about 100,000 feet. He believes the company can break 
even by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	If the company is successful with small rockets, it will build  
larger vehicles to carry more ambitious payloads, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're promoting something we can finance, that there is an  
established market for,'' he said. ``Investors want a fast return 
on their investment, and they want a good return on their 
investment.''

<HEADLINE> Author Accused of Stealing Ideas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A woman claims that Richard Paul Evans  
stole ideas from her manuscript for his 1998 best-selling novel, 
``The Locket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit filed by Leisa Hancock accuses Evans of using  
``distinctive sequences of events, distinctive locale, similarity 
of characters, similar plot and other original ideas'' in 
``Laurel,'' her unpublished novel. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans denied stealing Ms. Hancock's ideas or ever meeting her.  
</P>
<P>
	``We don't see any infringement here. What I would suggest is  
that you read both books and you will reach the same conclusion,'' 
said Thomas Vuksinick, Evans' attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hancock said she gave Evans a copy of her manuscript at a  
1995 writers conference in Provo and asked him to read it. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans' books included ``The Letter'' and ``The Timepiece.''

<HEADLINE> New Ads Aren't What You Think </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- All over town, people are doing double and  
triple takes at the new ad campaign featuring the initials for the 
clothing company French Connection U.K. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads, prominently displayed atop many New York City cabs,  
also show models posed alongside risque text. ``Think my clothes 
off,'' says one. ``Wash your mind out,'' says an ad in the 
company's SoHo store. 
</P>
<P>
	But not everybody finds it clever. Even New York's notoriously  
gruff taxi drivers have complained about the way the initials, 
fcuk, easily can be misread as bad language. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clearly denigrating to the industry,'' said Taxi  
Commissioner Allan J. Fromberg, who sent a letter to the 
London-based company asking it to change the approach. 
</P>
<P>
	The London public relations office for French Connection did not  
return a call for comment, and the company that designed the 
campaign is not discussing the ads.

<HEADLINE> Ripken Has Season of Gains &AMP; Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Cal Ripken proved this season he can still hit  
for average and with power. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iron Man also showed he is a mere mortal, burdened by a back  
injury that required surgery and the emotional blow of his father's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken's most trying season came to a sudden, early end  
Thursday. The 39-year-old third baseman closed the year just nine 
hits short of 3,000 for his career, a milestone he should reach in 
April if his rehabilitation proceeds as expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can carve this in granite: If anyone can come back from a  
back operation without losing a step, it's Cal Ripken,'' Dr. Bill 
Howard, director of sports medicine at Baltimore's Union Memorial 
Hospital, said Thursday. ``He's got the strength, the conditioning 
and the mindset to make it happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, it was hard to imagine Ripken missing a game, let  
alone a week. Or a month. The most durable player in the history of 
the sport played 2,632 consecutive games before voluntarily ending 
the run in the Orioles' final home date of the 1998 season. 
</P>
<P>
	This year was decidedly different. Ripken twice spent time on  
the disabled list for the first time since his career began in 
1981. He missed three weeks with lower back pain beginning April 20 
and sat out the entire month of August after the back spasms 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	He finally decided this week surgery was the only option, and he  
had an operation Thursday in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgery completed a season that began with the loss of his  
father, Cal Sr., who died of lung cancer in March. The emotional 
and physical pain diminished a year in which he hit his 400th 
career homer and compiled a .340 average, 64 points above the .276 
lifetime mark he carried into the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to meet a lot of professional and personal challenges,''  
Ripken said last week. ``When you look back, will it be a season to 
remember? I guess in some ways it would be, but for the most part, 
it represents something of a loss as well as something of a gain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gain? Ripken found a batting stance that let him either pull  
the ball or drive it to the opposite field. He got a career-high 
six hits in one game and his 18 homers were more than he had in 
four of his previous five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ironically, in my opinion, his back forced him to have a  
conservative stance for the first time in years,'' teammate Mike 
Mussina said. 
</P>
<P>
	An interesting theory, Ripken says.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think when I first started coming back and swinging the bat  
I was tentative because I didn't know what effect there was on the 
back. I started to get a pretty good feel in the batting cage and I 
developed it from there, so maybe you could say the back injury did 
have something to do with it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The back injury had everything to do with the fact that he  
played in only 86 games, a far cry from his steady 162. 
</P>
<P>
	And even when he was on the field, he couldn't shake the  
memories of his father, a former coach and manager with the Orioles 
who was by far the most notable influence in Ripken's stellar 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``The injuries that I've never had to deal with professionally  
and the loss of my father personally -- that affects everything I 
do, my focus, the ability to concentrate,'' Ripken said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all go through different issues and it all impacts on your  
work or your ability to function in life. I just happened to get a 
double dose of them at the same time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Personally and professionally, it was a hard dose of reality for  
a seemingly invulnerable sports hero. 
</P>
<P>
	``You live and learn,'' he said, ``and you deal with it as best  
you can.''

<HEADLINE> Ryder Cup Notebook  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- Mark O'Meara has gone from nearly  
invincible in major tournaments to virtually invisible in golf's 
top team event, the Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara, winner of last year's Masters and British Open, was one  
of two Americans on the 12-member team who were not chosen by 
captain Ben Crenshaw to play in Friday's opening matches -- an 
alternate-shot competition in the morning and a best-ball round in 
the afternoon. Steve Pate, one of two picks made by Crenshaw, was 
the other. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always frustrating when you can't get out and play,''  
said O'Meara, whose No. 11 world ranking is the sixth highest among 
U.S. golfers. ``No. I'm not angry. I'm disappointed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He dismissed the idea that his differences with Crenshaw on  
compensation for Ryder Cup golfers led to his inactivity. O'Meara, 
Tiger Woods, David Duval and Phil Mickelson were mentioned by the 
captain as perpetuating the controversy over how the PGA of America 
distributes Ryder Cup revenue to charities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've taken a pretty heavy hit on the issue,'' O'Meara said.  
``I just feel bad that my name's been thrown so heavily into that 
controversy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While his teammates played their afternoon round, an idle  
O'Meara said he didn't play well in practice Wednesday but hit the 
ball OK on Thursday. There's still a chance for O'Meara to play 
Saturday or Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ben's trying to do the best he can as a captain. It's not  
easy,'' O'Meara said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MONTY'S COMPLAINTS:* Colin Montgomerie complained about the  
size of the driving range when he arrived at The Country Club. It 
didn't take him long to take issue with something else when the 
Ryder Cup matches began. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson and Duval took an early lead in their alternate-shot  
match against Montgomerie and Paul Lawrie when Mickelson played a 
flop shot to within a foot for birdie at No. 6, and Montgomerie 
missed a 10-footer. 
</P>
<P>
	PGA official Bill Clarke announced the score incorrectly --  
``Europe 3, United States 4, Europe is plus-1'' -- and Montgomerie 
tried to correct him. 
</P>
<P>
	After Europe won the next hole to tie the match, Montgomerie  
approached another PGA official. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got it all wrong, and he's walked in my line twice,''  
Montgomerie said. The Scotsman said when he tried to point out the 
errors to Clarke, the official told him, ``I'm too old and too 
decrepit. There's nothing I can do about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't seem to matter. Europe won the opening match, 3 and 2.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *THE SAME IN ANY LANGUAGE:* When Payne Stewart hit a shot into a  
bunker to the left of the 17th green Friday morning, one spectator 
to the right of the green apparently didn't see where the ball 
landed. 
</P>
<P>
	Emma Villacieros, the chairman of the Spanish golf federation,  
tapped Sergio Garcia's mother on the shoulder and asked, ``El 
bunker?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Si,'' Garcia's mother said. ``Bunker.''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MEDICAL REPORT:* A 49-year-old man was revived after suffering  
a heart attack at the Ryder Cup. He was one of more than a 
half-dozen spectators with possible heart attacks at The Country 
Club by noon Friday, according to Dr. Charles Tracy, a club member 
and part of the event's medical team. 
</P>
<P>
	The man was standing near the 13th green during practice  
Thursday as Woods was approaching. The man collapsed and paramedics 
who arrived quickly found him unconscious and with no pulse. 
</P>
<P>
	``They shocked him once and he woke up. I have to believe we  
saved one man,'' Tracy said. He also said another person collapsed 
from a possible heart attack behind the staging during Thursday's 
opening ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	There was an ankle fracture, two epileptic seizures and a  
possible heart attack victim taken to the hospital, said Tracy, who 
practices at the Wellesley Center of Harvard Vanguard Medical 
Associates. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the presence of 20 portable defibrillators with  
personnel around the course was a key to responding rapidly to 
medical emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *OPENING JITTERS:* Jesper Parnevik had played in a Ryder Cup  
before. He was part of the European team that won in 1997 at 
Valderrama. But he admitted to having some jitters when he went to 
the first tee of Friday's alternate-shot opening round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was nervous,'' the Swede said. ``I couldn't make my mind up  
whether I was going to cut it or draw it off the first tee. I had 
about 50 thoughts going through my head on the downswing and I was 
just glad to see it go straight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parnevik and Garcia won the match over Woods and Tom Lehman, 2  
and 1. 
</P>
<P>
	British Open winner Paul Lawrie of Scotland also was feeling the  
heat as he hit the first tee shot of the entire tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't feel cool inside,'' the Ryder Cup rookie said. ``But,  
after that first drive, it wasn't that bad, really. After that, I 
think we played pretty good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He and Montgomerie beat Duval and Mickelson 3 and 2.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DIVOTS:*Former President George Bush and his wife Barbara  
followed the first group in Friday morning's foursome. So did 
Britain's Prince Andrew, who was walking inside the ropes with the 
gallery packed on the other side. One marshal, apparently unaware 
of his identity, told him: ``Other side of the ropes.'' ... 
Parnevik on the maturity of Garcia: ``He might be 19 on his birth 
certificate, but he isn't, really.'' ... The three Europeans who 
didn't play Friday were Andrew Coltart of Scotland, Jarmo Sandelin 
of Sweden and Jean Van de Velde of France.

<HEADLINE>  Fan Attacks Astros' Spiers on Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- A fan came on to the field and attacked Houston  
Astros right fielder Bill Spiers in the sixth inning of Friday 
night's game against the Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Brewers came to bat, the spectator jumped Spiers from  
behind and knocked him to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Spiers left an inning later with whiplash. He is listed as  
day-to-day. 
</P>
<P>
	The entire Astros bench came to Spiers defense. Mike Hampton,  
the starting pitcher, raced out and pummeled the spectator as other 
teammates tried to separate Hampton from the attacker. Astros 
relievers jumped over the bullpen wall in center field and joined 
the melee. 
</P>
<P>
	Spiers left momentarily with a welt under his left eye and a  
bloody nose. He stayed in for the rest of the inning, but was then 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
	The unidentified attacker, 23, from South Beloit, Ill., was  
handcuffed and led off the field by Milwaukee County sheriff's 
deputies. The sheriff's office said there would be no official 
identification of him unless charges are filed. 
</P>
<P>
	He will be formally charged Monday, a Brewers spokesman said.  
The spectator faces two counts of battery -- one for attacking 
Spiers, the other for slugging a ground crew member who was 
defending the pitcher -- and one count of disorderly conduct.

<HEADLINE> Reuters Shares Drop 15 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Shares in Reuters Group PLC tumbled 15 percent in  
heavy trading Thursday in fallout from briefings to British and 
American analysts a day earlier by the media and financial 
information company. 
</P>
<P>
	The selloff continued even after the company denied it had  
disclosed any profit warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Reuters ended a volatile session down the equivalent of $2.09 to  
close at $11.90 a share. With more than 55 million shares changing 
hands, it was the most active issue on the London Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Reuters U.S. shares were down nearly 11 percent Thursday on the  
Nasdaq Stock Market, dropping $8.75 to $71. 
</P>
<P>
	The slide followed company briefings to analysts on Wednesday.  
Some analysts reduced their forecasts for Reuters earnings 
following the session and HSBC Securities downgraded its rating of 
the stock. 
</P>
<P>
	One New York analyst cited by Dow Jones Newswires said Reuters  
told investors that orders for some financial information services 
had been deferred in recent months over concerns about the Year 
2000 bug. 
</P>
<P>
	Reuters also reportedly said Instinet, its electronic  
stock-trading service, was hindered by low trading volume at Nasdaq 
during July and August. Instinet handles around 15 percent of 
Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	``The background briefings were on subjects including Internet  
strategy, the plans of our Instinet electronic broker and the 
progress of the joint venture with Dow Jones,'' said a statement 
issued by Reuters on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	There was nothing in the briefings that could be construed as a  
profit forecast or as a profit-warning, the Reuters statement also 
said.

<HEADLINE> Mosley To Fight As a Welterweight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMECULA, Calif. (AP) -- Sugar Shane Mosley, dominant as a  
lightweight, is moving up in class and, he hopes, into matches that 
will gain him more attention and bigger purses. 
</P>
<P>
	The unbeaten Mosley, who has stopped 30 of his 32 opponents, has  
jumped two weight classes and will fight for the first time as a 
welterweight. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying he would welcome a bout against either Felix Trinidad or  
Oscar De La Hoya, Mosley first must get past Wilfredo Rivera. They 
meet Saturday night in a non-title bout at the Pechanga 
Entertainment Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Mosley, who took the IBF lightweight title from Philip Holiday  
in 1997 and won all eight of his title defenses by knockout, 
believes he actually will benefit from gaining 12 pounds up to the 
welterweight limit of 147. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel a lot stronger, I feel a lot faster, and I'm more  
sure-footed,'' he said. ``I think people wonder if I'll struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	``They expect me to not hit as hard and to be a little slower,  
but that won't be the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Mosley, his father and trainer, agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think Shane will have even more power because he hasn't had  
to worry so much about making the weight,'' Jack Mosley said. His 
son is moving from the 135-pound division to the 147-pound division 
and is by-passing the 140-pound junior welterweight class. 
</P>
<P>
	Shane Mosley, coming off an eighth-round knockout of John Brown  
on April 17, said he had difficulty making the 135-pound limit for 
that bout. 
</P>
<P>
	He believes fighting as a welterweight, a glamour class now with  
De La Hoya and Trinidad, will finally put him in the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
	While Trinidad holds the IBF and WBC welterweight titles, having  
beaten De La Hoya last Saturday, a match with De La Hoya could be 
the more lucrative one. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in a perfect place to show what I can do,'' Mosley said.  
``I want to put on a show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Jack Mosley: ``Shane is a star in his own right. We just  
want to make that star brighter. Sure, a fight with Oscar would do 
that. It would be great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mosley faces an accomplished foe in Rivera is (30-3-1). One of  
the losses was to De La Hoya, and the other two were to Pernell 
Whitaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera lost to De La Hoya when the fight was stopped after eight  
rounds because of a severe cut. Whitaker outpointed Rivera in each 
of their two meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera is coming off a first-round knockout of Jimmy Morgan on  
July 16.

<HEADLINE> Rite Aid Announces Job Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Rite Aid Corp. cut 330 jobs on Friday,  
about half of them near its Pennsylvania headquarters, in a move 
the drug store chain said would save $31.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The layoffs, which involve administrative and field staff  
positions, come just a day after the company revealed plans to 
close a distribution center in Utah and eliminate 500 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts won't affect staffing levels at Rite Aid stores, where  
the company hopes to place some of the employees losing their jobs, 
said spokeswoman Karen Rugen. 
</P>
<P>
	No more large reductions are planned, but it is possible that  
additional positions could be eliminated if the company sells some 
stores or other assets, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid, based in Camp Hill, Pa., employs about 85,000 people  
overall, including 2,000 in administrative positions. The company 
has struggled over the past year, reporting a 39-percent drop in 
fourth-quarter earnings in March. Rite Aid attributed the decrease 
to new store openings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our staff overhead expenses have started to grow at a rate  
faster than our business can support,'' Chairman and Chief 
Executive Officer Martin Grass said Friday in a statement. ``While 
we would prefer to not dislocate these fine hardworking employees, 
these cuts are necessary to make us more competitive and to help 
reenergize our financial growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The savings from the layoffs announced Friday will amount to  
about $20 million after taxes, or 7 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's financial ``results haven't been quite as good as  
it hoped, and it has cash flow problems,'' said Mark Husson, an 
analyst with Merrill Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the company announced it would shut a distribution  
center in Ogden, Utah, as it shifts its West Coast distribution 
network to a new facility in Lancaster, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Company spokeswoman Karen Rugen said Friday's announcement was  
unrelated to the company's actions in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts have predicted Rite Aid will sell several hundred  
West Coast stores which, along with the Ogden distribution center, 
were acquired from Thrifty Payless in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In Friday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Rite Aid  
slid 8 percent, falling $1 per share to $11. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid operates 3,800 stores in 30 states and the District of  
Columbia and has annual revenues of nearly $13 billion.

<HEADLINE> Scott Had a Curmudgeon Presence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- On screen and off, George C. Scott had such a  
curmudgeonly presence that his considerable acting talents seemed 
overshadowed by the force of his personality. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the fact that remains is whether Scott was on stage, in  
films or on television, he was among the most dynamic actors of his 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
	His performances reflected his personal life; he conducted both  
fearlessly and without quarter. Scott was 71 when he died 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1971 Associated Press interview, he reflected on his  
profession: 
</P>
<P>
	``There are only two kinds of actors, in my opinion: risk actors  
and safe actors. Safe actors hold back, experiment not, dare not, 
change nothing and have no artistic courage. I call them `walkers.' 
</P>
<P>
	``One of my professional faults has been never to walk. I may  
stagger a little now and then, but I have never been accused of 
walking. I would rather go out there and scream to the housetops 
than play it cool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such an attitude took its toll: stormy marriages, estrangement  
from his children, a long record of alcoholism, clashes with 
directors, producers, other actors and yes, the Academy of Motion 
Picture Arts and Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott had no respect whatsoever for the Academy Awards, which he  
dubbed ``a meat parade.'' He ignored his first Academy nomination 
as supporting actor for his second film, ``Anatomy of a Murder'' in 
1959. He tried unsuccessfully to decline his second nomination, for 
``The Hustler'' in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the inevitable Oscar.  
</P>
<P>
	If ever an actor was born to play a role, it was George C. Scott  
as Gen. George (Blood and Guts) Patton. Scott's opening harangue to 
the troops before a mammoth U.S. flag in the 1970 movie ``Patton'' 
proved one of the great scenes in film history. 
</P>
<P>
	And Scott's refusal to attend the ceremony or accept the award  
confirmed his Pattonesque reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I decided to speak my piece,'' he remarked in 1977. ``I sent  
the Academy a telegram which said, `Include me out.' They replied 
negatively, saying it was against policy. Whatever the hell policy 
means. It's all absolute b.s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next year when he was nominated for an Emmy for ``The  
Price,'' he tried to avoid another brouhaha by asking his friend 
Jack Cassidy to accept for him if he won. He did. 
</P>
<P>
	And when another Oscar nomination came in 1971 for ``The  
Hospital,'' Scott kept his mouth shut this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ah, it was so much nicer that way,'' he said later. ``I have  
finally found out how to handle these things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scott's first three marriages ended in divorce. The first one,  
although brief, resulted in the birth of a daughter. His second 
wife was pregnant with their second child when he left her for his 
co-star, Colleen Dewhurst. The union of two such strong-willed 
figures seemed doomed, although they wound up marrying each other 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1972, he married a fourth actress, Trish Van Devere. That  
union would survive numerous co-starrings and separations. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the actor's early years were marked by alcohol-fueled  
escapades. 
</P>
<P>
	``I drank that stuff for 30 years,'' he said in 1978, ``and I've  
given up on it. I got tired of feeling bad. I tried so hard to 
drink everything they make, but they won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With or without booze, he was an intimidating figure, so much so  
that when Maureen Stapleton was rehearsing the play ``Plaza Suite'' 
with Scott, she wailed to director Mike Nichols: ``I'm so 
frightened of George, I don't know what to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My dear,'' Nichols replied, ``the whole world is frightened of  
George.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Whole Foods To Spin Off Internet Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, (AP) -- Whole Foods Inc. said Thursday it will spin off  
its Internet grocery business and sell shares of the Web venture to 
the public within a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Austin-based natural foods store chain said it wants to  
build a ``healthy-living'' Web site where consumers can get 
information as well as groceries. 
</P>
<P>
	John P. Mackey, the company's founder and chief executive, will  
lead the new company, to be called WholePeople.com. The store chain 
sold a 13.5 percent stake in the new company to venture 
capitalists, whom Mackey would not identify. 
</P>
<P>
	Whole Foods' stock lost more than 9 percent in trading Friday on  
the NASDAQ stock market, down 3 15/32 to 33 3/32. 
</P>
<P>
	Whole Foods is the nation's largest natural foods chain, with  
more than 90 stores in more than 20 states and Washington, D.C. It 
stresses food free of pesticides, preservatives and sweeteners. Its 
stores include Whole Foods Market, Bread &AMP; Circus, Bread of Life, 
Fresh Fields, Merchant of Vino and Wellspring Grocery. The company 
has also moved into the coffee roasting and nutritional-supplements 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, with 14,200 employees, reported sales last year of  
nearly $1.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The new online company will include Amrion Inc., a mail-order  
vitamin-sales firm that Whole Foods bought in 1997, and American 
WholeHealth Inc., a holistic-medicine company. 
</P>
<P>
	An analyst said the spin-off indicates that selling groceries  
over the Internet, which Whole Foods started to do in March, isn't 
a profitable business. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you're going to see an explosion of people  
buying broccoli over the Internet, but you will see an explosion in 
people looking for information or easier-to-ship products,'' 
Matthew Patsky of Adams Harkness in Boston told the Austin 
American-Statesman. His company helped find investors for the new 
Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Online grocery sales last year were just $148 million, according  
to Jupiter Communications, an online research company in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Whole Foods is taking a non-recurring charge of $3.5 million to  
close two Amrion divisions. The company also said it would take a 
$6 million charge this quarter for software and hardware purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	Removing Amrion and WholeFoods.com from Whole Foods' balance  
sheet takes away $1.1 billion in revenue and about $34.7 million in 
net income, the company said. That means Whole Foods' fiscal year 
2000 earnings will likely be 18 to 26 cents below analysts' 
estimates of $2.13 per share, Mackey said. 
</P>
<P>
	He predicted that Whole Foods' traditional business will grow 15  
to 20 percent next year.

<HEADLINE>  Bush Emphasizes Defense, Weaponry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush's defense policy priorities are  
similar in many ways to those of the current administration. The 
Republican presidential candidate wants the military transformed 
into a more agile, mobile force, and he sees a growing threat to 
the American homeland from terrorists with weapons of mass 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Where Bush differs with President Clinton's approach is mainly  
on the pace of military change and the extent of U.S. troop 
deployments on open-ended peacekeeping missions like Bosnia and 
Kosovo. The Texas governor said in a policy speech Thursday that if 
elected to the White House he would order an immediate review of 
overseas commitments, though not to NATO or in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not be permanent peacekeepers, dividing warring  
parties,'' he said in an address to the Citadel military academy in 
Charleston, S.C. ``This is not our strength or our calling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Bush's prescriptions for a healthier military are  
similar to those pursued by Clinton, including pay raises for 
troops and innovations to make U.S. forces more adaptable and 
easier to deploy on short notice. Bush would spend $5 billion more 
on pay raises over the next five years than the administration 
currently proposes, and he would commit an extra $20 billion over 
five years on research and development of next-generation weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Kosiak, an analyst at the private Center for Strategic  
and Budget Assessments, said Bush's proposals were ``positive,'' 
but raised questions about how he would pay the bill while also 
pushing large tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech, Bush did not say how much he would add to defense  
spending overall, but Condoleeza Rice, his top foreign policy 
adviser, told reporters that he would propose ``significant 
increases'' to the $270 billion now spent on defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice said Bush would not attempt to change the current policy on  
gays in the military, which allows homosexuals to serve as long as 
they don't acknowledge their sexual preference. He also supports 
the current policy on roles for women in the military, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Cheney, who served as defense secretary in Bush's  
father's administration, said the Texas governor's defense policy 
``is on the right track.'' He said the special emphasis on military 
research and development was particularly important for maintaining 
the American military's global dominance well into the 21st 
century. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who holds a large lead in the polls over all Republican  
and Democratic contenders, said the Clinton administration had 
weakened the nation's defenses by embarking on ``vague, endless and 
aimless'' missions abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	As president, Bush said, he would order a top-to-bottom review  
of the military -- its structure, strategy and spending priorities -- 
and give his secretary of defense a mandate: ``Challenge the status 
quo and envision a new architecture of American defense for decades 
to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``At the earliest possible date'' Bush said his administration  
would deploy anti-missile systems to protect not only U.S. troops 
abroad and allies but also to shield the U.S. homeland from 
``attack and blackmail.'' He did not spell out how extensive the 
national system would be, but aides said it would be more complete 
than Clinton envisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration plans to decide as early as June 2000  
whether to deploy a limited national defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said he would have the United States withdraw from the 1972  
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Russia if Moscow refused to 
accept amendments allowing the testing and deployment of a national 
missile defense. The Clinton administration is pressing Moscow to 
accept such changes and has said withdrawal from the treaty remains 
an option. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said he would earmark at least 20 percent of the Pentagon's  
weapons procurement budget for programs that propel America 
``generations ahead'' in military technology. He mentioned such 
possibilities as a ``stealthy ship'' packed with long-range 
missiles and unmanned aircraft capable of long-range missile 
strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said he would commit an extra $20 billion to defense  
research and development between 2001 and 2006. That would be in 
addition to the approximately $173 billion the Clinton 
administration has proposed over a similar period.

<HEADLINE> Rushdie: Life Better Without Fatwa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIEGE, Belgium (AP) -- Salman Rushdie says his life has improved  
since Iran distanced itself last year from a death sentence against 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not 100 percent normal, but compared to what the last 10  
years have been like, it is better,'' the ``Satanic Verses'' author 
said at a news conference Friday.

	He said the lifting of the death sentence would allow him to  
focus on being a novelist rather than the center of a political 
debate.

<HEADLINE> Olazabal Comes Back at Ryder Cup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- From the solitude of a morning practice  
round to the cheers of the gallery at dusk, Jose Maria Olazabal 
returned to the Ryder Cup on Friday afternoon from a short, and 
self-imposed, sabbatical. 
</P>
<P>
	After benching himself in the morning alternate shot matches --  
snapping a perfect attendance record spanning five previous Ryder 
Cup appearances -- Olazabal paired with Miguel Angel Jimenez in the 
afternoon fourball to beat Hal Sutton and Jeff Maggert 2 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, it was a difficult decision for me not to play in  
the morning,'' Olazabal said after the European pair clinched a 
point with a par 4 on No. 17. ``But I think it was the right thing 
to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Olazabal spent the time on the course, trying to rescue  
a swing that has caused him to miss the cut in two majors -- he 
withdrew in the third, the U.S. Open, when he broke his hand 
punching a wall -- since winning the Masters in April. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, he was criss-crossing the fairways through his round,  
putting him between an access road and the gallery on No. 15 before 
he saved par with a 4. ``I still missed some tee shots that I was 
not pleased with,'' he said before trying to beat the sunset with a 
few more practice holes. 
</P>
<P>
	Sutton and Maggert were the only Americans to win their morning  
foursome match as the Europeans took a 6-2 lead after the first 
day. But Olazabal and Jimenez outplayed them, winning the first 
hole on Jimenez' birdie and holding a two-hole lead for 14 of the 
last 15 holes. 
</P>
<P>
	Golfers can play a minimum of one and a maximum of five matches  
in a Ryder Cup. For the first two days, in both morning and 
afternoon, the captain must choose eight members of the 12-man team 
to play and four to sit; all 12 play singles on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Olazabal had never sat out in five previous Ryder Cups  
-- that's 25 of a possible 25 matches, with a 14-8-3 record -- he 
went to European captain Mark James on Thursday and said his 
driving was too erratic to play in the alternate shot format. James 
obliged by leaving him out of the draw. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm quite happy with what Jose tells me,'' said James, who as  
captain has kept close tabs on all of his players' progress. 
``There's no secrets in that team room. It's an open book.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nor was it a difficult decision to play Olazabal in the  
afternoon, when the players each play the hole but count only the 
best score. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very good fourball player,'' James said. ``Even if he  
isn't driving the ball well,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal began playing at age 6, when his mother -- who worked at  
the same course in Spain where his father was the greenskeeper -- 
would take him out in the afternoon after everyone else had 
finished playing. 
</P>
<P>
	But with 35,000 people crowding into the The Country Club for  
the first day of matches on Friday, it wasn't quite so easy to find 
a moment of solitude on the course. Fans lined up five and 10 deep 
around the greens, and the grandstands located throughout the 
course were full whenever the golfers came near. 
</P>
<P>
	The foursomes were on the back nine and the crowds had followed  
them when Olazabal teed off No. 1 for some practice at 10:50 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Crickets chirped.  
</P>
<P>
	The wind rustled through the trees.  
</P>
<P>
	``Go get 'em, Jose,'' one man yelled to Olazabal as he and his  
caddie trudged down the first fairway. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was no one for Olazabal to ``get.''  
</P>
<P>
	Not yet, anyway.

<HEADLINE> London Stages Fashion Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Shrugging off the absence of several of its stars,  
London Fashion Week again proved it deserves its reputation for 
exciting, cutting-edge design. 
</P>
<P>
	From Hussein Chalayan's remote-controlled glass-fiber dress over  
a fluffy pink tutu, to Amanda Wakeley's sleekly classic evening 
sheaths, London has not lost its wow factor -- or its claim to be a 
fashion capital. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, it's been what people love London about: very  
extreme, very bold, very exciting,'' said designer Paul Costelloe, 
who opened proceedings Monday night with a collection of long 
tunics and fluid trousers in the brightest pinks. 
</P>
<P>
	While fashion ``may grow up elsewhere,'' said Daily Telegraph  
fashion editor Hilary Alexander, ``London is where you see fashion 
being born.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 40 designers held catwalk shows over four days and  
more than 200 others exhibited accessories and jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
	The look for spring/summer 2000 is ruched, ruffled and ridged,  
in layers of buttery leather, delicate lace or wisps of chiffon 
printed with florals, spots and stripes or scattered with sequins. 
The palette is white, moss, flesh tones and pastels. Look for 
blouson tops, the tiniest hot pants and daring backless dresses 
with this season's new neckline, the halter. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander McQueen, Vivienne Westwood and Nicole Farhi opted out  
of the London scene after unveiling their collections in New York 
last week. And once again, Antonio Berardi will stage his show in 
Milan. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chalayan, the British Designer of the Year, was there with  
an array of his trademark precision-cut garments. 
</P>
<P>
	In keeping with the season's very feminine look, he showed  
concertina frills and fluted hems on tutus and ballerina dresses. 
Some had cutaway backs with intricately scrolled petticoats that 
resembled rosebuds. 
</P>
<P>
	A child used a remote control device to open the glass-fiber  
panels of one dress, revealing a confection of tulle petticoats. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Smith produced trouser suits and shirts in candy stripes  
that evoked gracious 1920s tennis parties, and embroidered velvets 
inspired by India. Owen Gaster shone with skirts in skin-tight 
snakeskin, tailored pink tweed and leather printed with holograms. 
</P>
<P>
	Red or Dead's Wayne Hemingway sent ``real people'' down the  
catwalk in African prints and outfits in batik, cheesecloth and 
crushed linen, hessian, muslin and leather. He said he decided not 
to use models to give ``a sense of an egalitarian future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Welsh designer Julien Macdonald, known for his glorious knits,  
injected a note of glamour by having Mel G -- Scary Spice to her 
fans -- model a translucent pink beaded dress with slim jeweled 
straps. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Macdonald creations included vivid PVC bomber jackets  
printed with computer graphics, tie-dye jackets and fluorescent 
miniskirts and mirrored halter dresses. 
</P>
<P>
	Another up-and-coming designer, Matthew Williamson, produced  
sequin-studded camisoles and low-slung ``harem'' skirts studded 
with jewels, inspired by India's exotic Kathkali dancers. 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, most shows were held in marquees erected at the main  
venue, the Natural History Museum. But this year many designers 
opted for the battered warehouses that line Brick Lane in east 
London, the historical home of Britain's garment industry. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ex-Conn. Treasurer Guilty in Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A former state treasurer faces up to 40  
years in prison after he pleaded guilty to federal corruption 
charges of accepting over $100,000 in kickbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Paul Silvester was paid thousands of dollars by  
middlemen who get states to invest their pension money with certain 
financial firms. Some of the money turned up in his failed election 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``He used his authority as state treasurer to invest money not  
solely in the best interest of the funds, but to guarantee wealth 
for himself, his friends and his colleagues,'' U.S. Attorney 
Stephen Robinson said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Silvester, 37, pleaded guilty Thursday to racketeering and money  
laundering charges. He also faces a $750,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	The scheme included Silvester's brother and brother-in-law, who  
also pleaded guilty Thursday to federal corruption charges and face 
prison time. 
</P>
<P>
	Silvester was hustled out of the courthouse and away from  
reporters without answering questions. His attorney, Hubert Santos, 
said his client would have no comment, and said the pension fund 
had not been jeopardized. 
</P>
<P>
	Silvester, a Republican, was deputy state treasurer when he was  
appointed by Gov. John G. Rowland to finish the term of Christopher 
Burnham in July 1997. Burnham resigned to take a private-sector 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	Silvester lost the November 1998 election to Denise Nappier, who  
assured residents Thursday that the state pension fund was in good 
hands and that no one in her office is being investigated in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund actually grew from $16.8 billion to $18.5 billion  
during Silvester's tenure between September 1997 and February 1999, 
a month after he left office. 
</P>
<P>
	Silvester had been under investigation for several months for  
investments made during his final months in office. Most of the 
investments were made after the election but before his term ended 
Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	His 50-year-old brother, Mark, could get five years in jail and  
be ordered to pay a $250,000 fine after pleading guilty to 
conspiracy to solicit and accept corrupt payments. Their 
brother-in-law, Peter Hirschl, 43, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to 
launder money and faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
	All three were released on $10,000 bond and are scheduled to be  
sentenced March 20.

<HEADLINE> Fan Attacks Astros' Spiers on Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- A fan came on to the field along the right  
field line and attacked Houston Astros right fielder Bill Spiers in 
the bottom of the sixth inning of Friday night's game against the 
Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Brewers came to bat, the spectator jumped Spiers from  
behind and knocked him to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The entire Astros bench came to Spiers defense. Mike Hampton,  
the starting pitcher, raced out and pummeled the spectator as other 
teammates tried to separate Hampton from the attacker. Astros 
relievers jumped over the bullpen wall in center field and joined 
the melee. 
</P>
<P>
	Spiers left momentarily with a welt under his left eye and a  
bloody nose, but stayed in the game. Hampton was visibly upset by 
the attack.

<HEADLINE> Grizzlies Sold for $200 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- The Vancouver Grizzlies have  
been sold to the owner of the NHL's St. Louis Blues for $200 
million, and the new owner refuses to say what his long-term plans 
are for the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no current plan to move the Grizzlies,'' said Bill  
Laurie, who nonetheless refused to give any assurances to local 
fans that he won't try to move the team in the next year or two. 
</P>
<P>
	Laurie, along with his wife, Nancy, earlier this year tried  
unsuccessfully to purchase the Denver Nuggets. They own the new 
Kiel Center in downtown St. Louis -- an arena that all too often 
sits empty. That could change if Laurie decides to move the team, 
but such a scenario is at least a year or two away. 
</P>
<P>
	Franchises wanting to relocate must submit a petition to the  
league before March 1 in order to move for the following season. 
But the Grizzlies are prohibited by their expansion agreement from 
making such an application before May 15, 2000 -- a rule that, 
although it could be amended, would seem to ensure the team will 
continue to be based in Vancouver for the next two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase price of $200 million was confirmed to The  
Associated Press by two league sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity. Former owner John McCaw would only say that he sold the 
team for a profit. 
</P>
<P>
	One year ago, the New Jersey Nets sold for $150 million --  
meaning the Laurie purchase has driven up the value of the other 28 
teams substantially. 
</P>
<P>
	Laurie, an avid basketball fan and a former point guard for  
Memphis State, agreed in April to buy the Colorado Avalanche of the 
NHL, the Denver Nuggets of the NBA and Denver's new Pepsi Center 
for $400 million. But he lost out when a rival group, given a 
second chance to bid, offered $461 million. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the Grizzlies sale came just as league officials, from  
coaches to general managers to support staff, were arriving in 
Vancouver to attend the league meetings held every other year. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner David Stern voiced his personal opposition to a  
relocation, citing the league's record of not having any franchise 
migrations since the Clippers moved from San Diego to Los Angeles 
in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my goal to see the Grizzlies stay and succeed in  
Vancouver,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision on whether to allow the team to move, however,  
would ultimately be made by the league's Board of Governors. Of the 
league's 29 owners, only 15 would be needed to approve a 
relocation. A three-quarters majority would be needed to approve 
the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not unprecedented for an NBA team to move, but on the  
other hand when you place a franchise someplace, you ask the fans 
to make a certain commitment to the team,'' Stern said. ``And it's 
not inappropriate for the fans to expect the team to have some 
commitment to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laurie, asked repeatedly if he would give the fans of Vancouver  
some kind of commitment or reassurance, refused to say anything of 
substance regarding his long-term plans for the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really feel uncomfortable with the skepticism, only because  
this is a big day for our family,'' Laurie said. ``This is a big 
step for us, and somehow some of the excitement and fun is being 
taken away by the cloud hanging over us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCaw also owns the NHL Vancouver Canucks and GM Place, the  
team's 19,000-seat arena. Both had been for sale, but McCaw said 
they are now off the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation has swirled about the future of the Grizzlies  
franchise since McCaw said last month he was willing to sell part 
or all of his Orca Bay sports empire. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grizzlies have met with limited success since joining the  
NBA, never winning more than 19 games. Vancouver was 8-42 in the 
lockout-shortened 1999 season, the worst record in the 29-team 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareef Abdur-Rahim, the Grizzlies' best player, reacted  
cautiously to the sale announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``With everything happening as fast as it has, the reassuring  
thing is that the people I trust and the people I believe in are 
still there,'' Abdur-Rahim said. ``I believe in (general manager) 
Stu (Jackson) and the people up there, and as long as that 
situation is the same, it's cool. That was the determining factor 
in me signing (a contract extension last season) -- Stu being there 
and making me believe in his vision of what we need to do.''

<HEADLINE>  Bush Emphasizes Defense, Weaponry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush's defense policy priorities are  
similar in many ways to those of the current administration. The 
Republican presidential candidate wants the military transformed 
into a more agile, mobile force, and he sees a growing threat to 
the American homeland from terrorists with weapons of mass 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Where Bush differs with President Clinton's approach is mainly  
on the pace of military change and the extent of U.S. troop 
deployments on open-ended peacekeeping missions like Bosnia and 
Kosovo. The Texas governor said in a policy speech Thursday that if 
elected to the White House he would order an immediate review of 
overseas commitments, though not to NATO or in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not be permanent peacekeepers, dividing warring  
parties,'' he said in an address to the Citadel military academy in 
Charleston, S.C. ``This is not our strength or our calling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Bush's prescriptions for a healthier military are  
similar to those pursued by Clinton, including pay raises for 
troops and innovations to make U.S. forces more adaptable and 
easier to deploy on short notice. Bush would spend $5 billion more 
on pay raises over the next five years than the administration 
currently proposes, and he would commit an extra $20 billion over 
five years on research and development of next-generation weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Kosiak, an analyst at the private Center for Strategic  
and Budget Assessments, said Bush's proposals were ``positive,'' 
but raised questions about how he would pay the bill while also 
pushing large tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech, Bush did not say how much he would add to defense  
spending overall, but Condoleeza Rice, his top foreign policy 
adviser, told reporters that he would propose ``significant 
increases'' to the $270 billion now spent on defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice said Bush would not attempt to change the current policy on  
gays in the military, which allows homosexuals to serve as long as 
they don't acknowledge their sexual preference. He also supports 
the current policy on roles for women in the military, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Cheney, who served as defense secretary in Bush's  
father's administration, said the Texas governor's defense policy 
``is on the right track.'' He said the special emphasis on military 
research and development was particularly important for maintaining 
the American military's global dominance well into the 21st 
century. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who holds a large lead in the polls over all Republican  
and Democratic contenders, said the Clinton administration had 
weakened the nation's defenses by embarking on ``vague, endless and 
aimless'' missions abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	As president, Bush said, he would order a top-to-bottom review  
of the military -- its structure, strategy and spending priorities -- 
and give his secretary of defense a mandate: ``Challenge the status 
quo and envision a new architecture of American defense for decades 
to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``At the earliest possible date'' Bush said his administration  
would deploy anti-missile systems to protect not only U.S. troops 
abroad and allies but also to shield the U.S. homeland from 
``attack and blackmail.'' He did not spell out how extensive the 
national system would be, but aides said it would be more complete 
than Clinton envisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration plans to decide as early as June 2000  
whether to deploy a limited national defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said he would have the United States withdraw from the 1972  
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Russia if Moscow refused to 
accept amendments allowing the testing and deployment of a national 
missile defense. The Clinton administration is pressing Moscow to 
accept such changes and has said withdrawal from the treaty remains 
an option. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said he would earmark at least 20 percent of the Pentagon's  
weapons procurement budget for programs that propel America 
``generations ahead'' in military technology. He mentioned such 
possibilities as a ``stealthy ship'' packed with long-range 
missiles and unmanned aircraft capable of long-range missile 
strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said he would commit an extra $20 billion to defense  
research and development between 2001 and 2006. That would be in 
addition to the approximately $173 billion the Clinton 
administration has proposed over a similar period.

<HEADLINE> Social Security Statements Coming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Social Security will begin mailing annual  
statements to 125 million working Americans beginning Oct. 1, 
telling many for the first time how much they've paid into the 
nation's retirement system and what they can expect to get back. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hoping it will help people understand what Social  
Security can provide, but also encourage them to do further 
planning for retirement savings,'' said commissioner Kenneth S. 
Apfel. ``It's hard to live just on Social Security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, the Social Security statements have been available  
upon request, and 37 million Americans have asked for theirs since 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting Oct. 1, the personalized letters will be mailed  
automatically, in batches of 500,000 a day, timed so that every 
worker over age 25 will receive an updated one each year about 
three months before his or her birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress voted in 1989 to require the mailings, which at 56  
cents a letter will cost about $70 million a year. Because of the 
personal nature of the information, Social Security officials said 
the letters will be mailed first class. 
</P>
<P>
	Commercial Data Center Inc., a printing company located outside  
Dayton, Ohio, which got the contract for the job has hired 20 new 
employees and will be dropping off 40,000 pounds of mail a day at 
the city's airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Not even the Internal Revenue Service does a bigger mailing to  
American households each year when tax forms go out. 
</P>
<P>
	The Social Security Administration has been gearing up for the  
enormous task since 1995, by sending sample statements to about 73 
million people, most over age 40. The statements have been 
simplified during the course of the test to a four-page format that 
includes: 
</P>
<P>
	--A two-column chart showing annual earnings for each year  
subject to Social Security and Medicare taxes from a person's first 
job to 1998. These numbers are significant because the amount of 
future Social Security benefits depend, in part, on a person's past 
earnings and tax contributions. In 1998, all earnings were subject 
to a 1.45 percent Medicare payroll tax and earnings up to $68,400 
were subject to a 6.2 percent Social Security tax. 
</P>
<P>
	--The total amount of taxes a person has paid into the retirement  
system over the years, and separately, what his or her employers 
have paid. Employers must match employees' Social Security and 
Medicare contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	--Estimates of monthly retirement benefits assuming a person  
continued earning at his or her current salary level until retiring 
early at age 62; on time at 65, 66 or 67; or late at age 70. The 
age of eligibility for full Social Security benefits is scheduled 
to rise incrementally to 67 from 65. Those who choose to retire 
even later get higher monthly benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	--Estimates of monthly disability benefits if a worker became  
disabled today. 
</P>
<P>
	--Estimates of survivors benefits a worker's family would receive  
if the worker died this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter also gives a toll-free telephone number that people  
are urged to call if they find mistakes in their statements. Social 
Security officials expect to get about 233,000 such calls during 
the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
	Some getting the new statements may be pleasantly surprised to  
discover that Social Security provides financial protection for the 
young as well as the old. Polls have shown that the program's 
disability and survivor benefits are not widely understood. 
</P>
<P>
	For many, however, the statements are likely to be a ``wake-up  
call,'' showing just how modest a retirement income Social Security 
provides, said Don Blandin, president of the American Savings 
Education Council. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a very important line in the letter: 'Social Security  
benefits were not intended to be the only source of income for you 
and your family when you retire,''' said Blandin, whose group runs 
a public service campaign encouraging people to save. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial planners generally tell working people that they will  
need about 70 percent of their present income to live comfortably 
when they retire. For average earners, Social Security benefits 
will replace only about 40 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Social Security's own looming financial problems are also  
acknowledged in the letters. The program is expected to run short 
of cash in 2034, and lawmakers remain sharply divided over the best 
remedy. 
</P>
<P>
	In an introductory message to the new statements, Apfel says,  
``The program has changed in the past to meet the demands of the 
times and must do so again.''

<HEADLINE> Worries About Vietnam Nagged LBJ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- On Election Day 1964, on the brink of one of  
the biggest presidential landslides ever, Lyndon Johnson lay in bed 
at 5 p.m., nursing a headache and sore hip -- and sorting out his 
conflicted thoughts about whether to escalate U.S. involvement in 
Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	On newly released presidential tape recordings, Johnson yawns  
noisily into the phone and complains about his back, head and hip 
pains. Yet he ignores advice from his assistant Bill Moyers to take 
a break and celebrate his victory under the Florida sun. Something 
troubled him deeply. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm afraid of Vietnam,'' Johnson tells Moyers in a hoarse  
voice. 
</P>
<P>
	The conversation is among 36 hours of recorded conversations  
released Friday by the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library. Most of the 
tapes were recorded in November and December 1964 as Johnson, who 
became president after President Kennedy's assassination in 1963, 
was elected to his own four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
	The tapes capture Johnson's earthy and domineering persona. He  
exchanges oral backslaps on election night and chats about civil 
rights with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. In the King phone call, 
Johnson calls his victory, which was heavily supported by black 
voters, ``a great tribute to the intelligence and the judgment and 
the patriotism of the Negro people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wonders aloud how large his win will be. He chuckles -- even  
snorts -- on the tapes and jokes about how his running mate, Herbert 
H. Humphrey from Minnesota, had donned Western duds and hopped on a 
horse at the LBJ ranch in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	But the tapes also show a president burdened by Vietnam and  
still undecided about America's response to communist actions in 
Southeast Asia. It wasn't until March 1965 that Marines, the first 
U.S. combat troops, landed in South Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon, antiwar protesters would chant, ``Hey! Hey! LBJ! How many  
kids did you kill today?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are two schools of thought on this,'' said Michael  
Beschloss, a presidential historian who is writing three books on 
the Johnson tapes. ``One is that Johnson came to the presidency in 
November 1963 desperate to escalate the war in Vietnam. The other 
is that he believed in the American commitment to South Vietnam, 
but that as late as the end of 1964, he was open-minded on how to 
carry that out. 
</P>
<P>
	``What these tapes show is that he was still keeping his counsel  
and actually still soliciting recommendations as late as Election 
Day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after the election, Johnson asks Attorney General  
Robert F. Kennedy, ``If you get any solution for Vietnam, just call 
me direct, will you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the same phone call, Johnson warns of moving too fast on  
Vietnam. He tells Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield, D-Mont., 
that he has received ``some pretty strong ideas'' from 
congressional leaders. But he says: ``I sent them back and told 
them, 'Let's be careful. Let's, let's look where we're going before 
we go.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Later that same day, Johnson asks Defense Secretary Robert  
McNamara for an update on Vietnam. ``It's just a worrisome 
problem,'' McNamara tells him. ``None of us have a pat answer that 
we're ready to give you yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walt Rostow, director of policy planning at the State Department  
in late 1964, said in a telephone interview that Johnson was still 
weighing the decision about troops in early 1965. ``He didn't wait 
until the election was over and say, 'Well now, let's go,''' Rostow 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his worries about Vietnam, the tapes also reveal  
Johnson's teasing and cajoling. 
</P>
<P>
	He jokes with congressional leaders about Vice President-elect  
Humphrey, who was bunking at Johnson's ranch right after the 
election. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did you hear what Hubert announced in his speech here?''  
Johnson asks the leaders who were gathered in a room on the other 
end of the line. ``By God, he said he'd resign if there was any 
more horseback riding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Humphrey jokes that his Western clothes were ``droopy,'' and  
blames it on Johnson. ``After all, the president was the man that 
dressed me,'' Humphrey says. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson asks Sen. Ross Bass, D-Tenn., how he thought Humphrey  
looked on a horse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll tell you what. That's a desecration to put him on a  
Tennessee walking horse,'' jokes Bass. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is that a desecration of Hubert or the horse?'' Johnson says  
in a quick comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	Humphrey breaks out laughing.

	Senate negotiators offered a plan to fund $1.2 billion of the  
original $1.8 billion that the Pentagon had requested for the 
program for the fiscal year that begins on Oct 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of being used to buy six of the new aircraft as the  
administration had requested, however, the proposal would put the 
bulk of the money into research, development and testing. 
</P>
<P>
	That could, in effect, delay production of the new sophisticated  
fighter for at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate earlier had voted to provide the full $1.8 billion  
for fiscal 2000 requested by the administration for the $65 billion 
aircraft being produced by Lockheed Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate offer, made by Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, chairman  
of the Senate Appropriations Committee, was a refinement on an 
informal proposal he made earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	House negotiators had voiced preliminary support for such a  
plan.

<HEADLINE> McNair 'Doing Great' After Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tennessee Titans quarterback Steve  
McNair made his first visit to the practice field since back 
surgery and said he feels ``great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNair underwent surgery for a ruptured disc last weekend and is  
expected to miss at least five more weeks. The injury snapped his 
streak of consecutive starts at 34. 
</P>
<P>
	McNair, who opened the season with a career-high 341 yards and  
three touchdown passes in a 36-35 victory over Cincinnati, is 
anxious to return to play again. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hurts a lot to know that my team battles every Sunday and I  
can't be a part of it,'' he said Friday. '' ... I've got to get 
ready to get better to get back on this field to play and help my 
team win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNair was slowed by a sore back for much of training camp and  
ruptured the disc at practice Sept. 16. He underwent surgery two 
days later in Los Angeles. He returned to Nashville Thursday and 
watched Friday's practice in street clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	``About five hours after the surgery I was walking,'' McNair  
said. ``I'm doing great.''

<HEADLINE> Financier May Need Public Defender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Authorities say rogue financier Martin  
Frankel masterminded one of the largest insurance scams in U.S. 
history, but now he doesn't even have enough money to pay his legal 
bills, according to his lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	New Haven defense attorney Hugh Keefe said Friday he will  
withdraw as Frankel's lawyer because federal officials have frozen 
all of Frankel's assets and rejected requests to release a portion 
of the funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you were to believe the government, he's allegedly one of  
the great white-collar criminals of our time, but if he is, he 
certainly doesn't have any funds to hire a private lawyer,'' Keefe 
told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can't very well mount a defense unless he gets some of the  
money they seized from him,'' Keefe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Keefe said the money was needed both to pay his bill and hire  
experts to work for the defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Delcie Thibault, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in  
Connecticut, declined to say how much the government had seized or 
comment on Keefe's claims. A message was left seeking comment from 
a spokeswoman for the FBI in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel, a 44-year-old money manager from Greenwich, fled the  
United States in May after allegedly bilking insurance companies in 
five states out of hundreds of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	When Frankel was arrested in a hotel room in Hamburg, Germany,  
on Sept. 4, authorities seized more than $1 million in cash and 
diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, the FBI seized one of the two mansions Frankel kept in  
Greenwich. The IRS seized the second estate earlier this month, 
alleging it was bought with money from a Swiss bank account into 
which Frankel had deposited $44 million he stole from the insurance 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	State regulators have seized $57.5 million and were seeking  
another $26.5 million in a frozen Swiss bank account linked to 
Frankel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, we're working with other states toward whatever  
other asset recovery will be possible,'' said Marilyn Elam, a 
spokeswoman for the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Keefe said defending Frankel will require an array of  
high-priced experts, including forensic accountants to help 
decipher the wildly varying estimates of the loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators say Frankel's unlicensed brokerage siphoned at least  
$218 million from insurers in Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, 
Oklahoma and Tennessee. A lawsuit filed by some of the companies 
puts the loss much higher, at $915 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators originally thought Frankel may have stolen as much  
as $1.98 billion from the St. Francis of Assisi Foundation, a bogus 
charity Frankel established last year in the British Virgin 
Islands. But it's now unclear whether much -- if any -- of that money 
ever existed. 
</P>
<P>
	Keefe said he has notified the federal public defender's office  
in Connecticut that they may have to appoint someone to defend 
Frankel. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas G. Dennis, chief federal public defender, could not be  
reached for comment Friday. Two messages were left at his Hartford 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Keefe said he has been unable to speak to Frankel since he was  
arrested because officials at the Hamburg prison where Frankel is 
being held will not allow Frankel to use the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he will remain as Frankel's lawyer for several more days  
as he waits to hear whether German officials will allow him to 
speak to Frankel to explain the process for appointing a new 
attorney.

<HEADLINE> Gore Announces Organ Donation Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration announced a series  
of initiatives aimed at increasing organ donation, including a $13 
million grant to educate people. 
</P>
<P>
	``The steps we are taking today will not only highlight the need  
for organ donation, it will make organ donation more possible and 
will help more of America's families to share the gift of health 
and life,'' said Vice President Al Gore. Gore was joined at 
Friday's announcement by both organ donors and recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	The initiatives include a $13 million grant to community  
organizations to improve the donation request process, increase 
outreach to minority communities and implement school-based and 
workplace donor education programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also released new public service announcements to educate  
the public about organ donation and announced plans for a series of 
regional conferences with health care providers and transplant 
professionals to share strategies. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, President Clinton signed the Organ Donor Leave Act,  
which expands the current seven-day limit on leave for federal 
employees for organ donation. 
</P>
<P>
	The act was designed to encourage more people to become donors.  
Currently more than 65,000 Americans are awaiting a transplant. 
Last year, almost 5,000 died while waiting for donors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of these deaths could have been prevented if there were a  
sufficient supply of donor organs,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new law, federal employees serving as organ donors  
would receive up to 30 days of paid leave in addition to sick or 
annual leave.

<HEADLINE> Vikings Dare Teams To Keep Blitzing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Randy Moss wanted to work on beating  
the blitz, but he couldn't outrun the flu bug. 
</P>
<P>
	Moss was sent home sick Thursday and was added to the Minnesota  
Vikings' injury report as probable for Sunday's showdown at Green 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Before he felt queasy, Moss said the Vikings were going to have  
to start focusing more on making teams pay for blitzing them silly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once defensive coordinators saw a lot of the teams during the  
preseason blitz us, I think they felt that it might be a weak spot, 
a weak link in our offense,'' Moss said. ``And hopefully we'll pick 
it up, so I think we just got to ... practice better week in and 
week out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings are actually daring teams to keep it up, however.  
</P>
<P>
	``We like people to blitz,'' coach Dennis Green insisted. ``I  
think if you have the right receivers and you're on your game, then 
that's a way that you can strike very quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problem for the Vikings (1-1) is they haven't been on top of  
their game yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, they set an NFL scoring record with a quick-strike  
offense that forced teams to respect the deep ball and not risk 
sending defensive backs and linebackers after the quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	Randall Cunningham had all day to throw the deep jump ball to  
Moss or Cris Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Minnesota is struggling to score points and run the ball  
effectively. Cunningham is spending too much time on the turf 
because his Pro Bowl-studded offensive line is getting beaten 
repeatedly, and Moss hasn't gotten into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings expect to see plenty of blitzes Sunday at Green Bay,  
especially with new coach Ray Rhodes much more willing to send 
LeRoy Butler, the best blitzing safety in the NFL, after 
Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are going to blitz,'' Green said. ``They're going to  
take their chances on whether or not they can cover Randy Moss and 
Cris Carter one-on-one. It helps to shut down the run game. And 
we've just got to do a better job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teams plotted ways to stop the Vikings all offseason and so far  
the blueprint is this: blitz more often and send defensive backs 
into deep coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	That's deprived Cunningham of the time and Moss of the room that  
allowed them to hook up for 10 touchdowns of 40 yards or more last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teams are going to do that, but we'll adjust pretty quick,''  
promised Cunningham, who also said he's going to get rid of the 
ball more quickly. ``I don't know what coach Green is going to do 
offensively, but I think we'll get to a point where we're 
outsmarting teams, because we know what teams are going to do 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the Vikings having scored just 17 points in each of their  
games so far after averaging 35 last year, Moss said he expects 
opponents to stick to what's working. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they'll approach the game as far as not letting me  
explode or have a career day. I think teams on down the line are 
going to take the same approach,'' Moss said. ``When you're 
doubling, tripling me, we've just got to find a way to make it 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Complicating matters is the knee injury to Pro Bowl right tackle  
Korey Stringer, who will play half the snaps at best with 
second-year pro Matt Birk getting the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings didn't allow more than three sacks in any game last  
year, but yielded six against Oakland last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anything, it's going to make everyone concentrate that much  
more,'' center Jeff Christy said. ``Everyone's going to re-evaluate 
where they're at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Offensive line coach Mike Tice said he had full confidence in  
Birk and agreed with Green that he'd love to see the steady diet of 
blitzes continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We love the blitz,'' Tice said. ``I hate to say it, but we  
love the blitz because we've had a lot of big plays against the 
blitz. We used to beg for the blitz. Yeah, they're blitzing us, who 
cares? If we hit a couple big plays, they're not going to blitz us, 
you know? They'll be petrified.''

<HEADLINE> F-22 Compromise Still Elusive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional negotiators are working toward a  
middle ground on the F-22 stealth fighter that will keep the 
program alive, but at a slower pace of production. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks were continuing behind the scenes over offers and  
counteroffers that were flying between the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	One proposal on the table, offered by Senate negotiators, called  
for putting much of the $1.8 billion that had been earmarked by the 
Pentagon for buying the first six F-22s into more testing and 
research. 
</P>
<P>
	That could delay production by a year of a plane the Air Force  
hopes to have by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., chairman of the House Appropriations  
defense subcommittee suggested that House negotiators could accept 
a version of that proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	But not all Senate negotiators had signed on.  
</P>
<P>
	Since the House voted to halt the program in July as too costly,  
both the Pentagon and its prime contractor, Lockheed Martin Corp., 
have waged a furious lobbying campaign to save it. 
</P>
<P>
	But at the same time, ``the opposition has toughened in many  
ways,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., one of the negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
	Leahy said he expects the final compromise to at least save part  
of the program, which he likens to ``that second mortgage you never 
can quite get rid of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The F-22 debate comes as the House-Senate conference committee  
is working on a $267 billion military spending bill for the fiscal 
year that begins Oct. 1. Congressional still hope to have the 
measure completed by week's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the House voted to halt the program in July as too costly,  
both the Pentagon and Lockheed have waged a furious lobbying 
campaign to save it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate had approved the full administration request for $1.8  
billion for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 to buy six of the new 
planes. The House had voted to suspend production.

<HEADLINE> Dead Groom Found in Storage Unit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UPLAND, Calif. (AP) -- When Maria Blackburn opened the contents  
of an abandoned storage unit she bought at auction, she found 
wedding pictures, champagne glasses and the body of the groom. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the bride who smiled back from those photos is behind bars  
and charged with murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Darlene Bourk, 31, pleaded innocent to killing Robert Bourk, the  
San Bernardino County district attorney's office said Thursday. 
Investigators believe he died in December 1996 when he was 27. It 
was unclear when the couple married. 
</P>
<P>
	Upland police Lt. Ed Gray wouldn't elaborate on the events that  
led to Bourk's death or say how he died, but he said Bourk would 
have remained listed as missing had his wife not failed to pay the 
Stor-King self-storage facility in Upland, about 50 miles east of 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	After two missed $25 payments, Stor-King auctioned off the unit,  
and Mrs. Blackburn paid $20 for its contents, which she planned to 
use to stock a thrift store in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	As she began opening the 20 to 30 boxes in the unit, she pulled  
out wedding photos, champagne glasses and then bloodstained 
clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	In a carefully wrapped wardrobe box, stuffed with two tarps, a  
blanket and a layer of thick roofing plastic, she found Bourk's 
body. 
</P>
<P>
	Stor-King manager Susie Gonzalez said Mrs. Bourk called in a  
panic after receiving notice her belongings had been sold. She left 
two notes on the storage unit, saying she'd ``give anything, 
anything to get the storage back,'' Mrs. Blackburn told The Press 
Enterprise of Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested Mrs. Bourk on Sept. 15, the day after the  
auction, in nearby San Dimas where she lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Although most of the contents of the storage unit were taken by  
police as evidence, Mrs. Blackburn said she was able to keep some 
of the items, including wedding pictures of a smiling Bourk. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looked like a nice, handsome man,'' she said. She said she  
plans to send them to Bourk's mother.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks-Suns Merger Is Mulled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Jerry Colangelo, the Phoenix sports entrepreneur  
who runs baseball's Diamondbacks and the NBA's Suns, is exploring 
the possibility of merging the teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a move would pair a young baseball franchise that is having  
record-setting success on the field but faces major debts with a 
basketball franchise that is one of the most successful financially 
in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners have been using such mergers recently to help them in  
negotiating broadcast and naming rights deals, streamlining 
overhead and even starting up their own sports broadcast networks. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're seeing unique partnerships and bundlings taking place,  
and this is the future,'' Colangelo said Thursday from San 
Francisco, where the Diamondbacks will try to clinch the NL West 
title against the Giants on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``But this has nothing to do with anything immediate. I'm just  
listening and talking with people more than anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Any decision is at least a year away, he said. The mergers add  
value in an era when the key to successful sports franchises isn't 
in ticket sales but media revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	``The advantages are mainly in marketing -- local television and  
radio revenues,'' Colangelo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo is majority owner of the Suns. He is managing general  
partner of the Diamondbacks, but only owns about 1 percent of the 
team. The rest is owned by 28 other investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks' owners have invested $350 million already, and  
Colangelo went back to them for another $24 million to meet cash 
flow needs over the next year or so. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts describe the concept of combining franchises into one  
business as the ownership model of the future. The New York Yankees 
and New Jersey Nets are almost finished with just such a move. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about building sports conglomerates from the ground floor  
up, rather than a conglomerate buying a sports franchise and 
fitting it into the conglomerate,'' Dean Bonham, president of the 
Bonham Group, a Denver-based sports-business consulting firm, told 
The Arizona Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo said the merger is just one of the options he is  
considering. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may seem very complicated on the outside, but basically  
when you merge assets, it's a matter of allocating values,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, the owners of the franchise with the most value  
would have the bigger percentage of ownership of the combined 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Any merger of the Diamondbacks and Suns ``would be heavily  
weighted toward the Suns because of our strong financial 
situation,'' Colangelo said. 
</P>
<P>
	If Colangelo did pursue the option of bundling the teams, his  
partners in both ventures would have to agree. 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo spent $118.9 million on free agents in the  
Diamondbacks' offseason, although much of those salaries are 
deferred well into the future. He said the investment was necessary 
to make the team competitive in a hurry in order to keep attendance 
from falling off too much. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, season ticket sales declined by about 9,000. On the  
field, though, the tactic worked. The Diamondbacks are on the brink 
of being the first team to make the playoffs in just its second 
year of existence.

<HEADLINE> Mets Trying To Regroup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The New York Mets staggered into Veterans  
Stadium on Friday after being swept in their NL East showdown with 
Atlanta. Manager Bobby Valentine tried everything he could to help 
them forget the Disaster in Dixie. 
</P>
<P>
	``The team has been addressed,'' Valentine said before the Mets  
lost their fourth straight, 3-2 to the Philadelphia Phillies. ``It 
was succinct, I thought. I looked around and I didn't see anybody 
frowning and I didn't see anybody looking down about what I said.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine addressed the team after Thursday's 6-3 loss in  
Atlanta. One of the Mets' sloppiest losses of the season came at 
the absolute worst time. The three-game sweep left New York four 
games behind the Braves in the NL East and only two games ahead of 
Cincinnati for the wild card. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the Mets' seventh loss in nine games against their  
nemesis, and their 13th loss in 14 games at Turner Field. 
</P>
<P>
	So there was little doubt that Valentine sought to squelch any  
ideas in the minds of his players that they can't beat the Braves. 
They have three more games against Atlanta at Shea Stadium next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're good and they won,'' Valentine said he told his team.  
``We're good and we lost. They're not perfect, and neither are we. 
</P>
<P>
	``Luckily, they haven't beaten us thoroughly this year. They  
have beaten us more than we've beaten them. Luckily, we play them a 
lot more times this year. We'll see if there's doubt, won't we? 
That's what this is all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Piazza, who hit his 38th homer off Greg Maddux on Thursday  
to set a club record with 118 RBIs, was cautious when asked about 
Valentine's talk. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it was any different than any other postgame  
talk,'' Piazza said. ``Aside from anything that he said, as a team 
we've always felt like we need to improve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets were trying to regroup Friday night after collapsing in  
Atlanta late in the season for the second straight year. New York 
lost its final five games, when only one victory would have put 
them in a playoff for the NL wild card. Three of those losses came 
in the season-ending series at Turner Field. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final game of this series, the usually sure-handed Mets  
were undone by sloppy play. The best-fielding team in the majors 
made two costly throwing errors, both allowing runs to score. First 
baseman John Olerud, who made one of the errors, also failed to 
complete a pickoff when he couldn't get the ball out of his glove 
in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know what about mistakes?'' Valentine asked. ``They blew a  
double play and got picked off three times, but you know what? They 
hit a three-run homer and they won. What can you do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine was still defending Rickey Henderson on Friday, too.  
Henderson hurt the Mets when he tried to score from first on 
Edgardo Alfonzo's double in the fifth. Henderson, hobbled by a 
tight hamstring, hesitated twice and ran through third-base coach 
Cookie Rojas' stop sign and was out easily at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to me that with Rickey, similar plays have happened  
about four times,'' Valentine said. ``He was safe the other three 
times. He was not safe, so it looked bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson tested his hamstring before the game and was in the  
lineup against the Phillies, leading off and playing left field.

<HEADLINE> EPA Seeks Great Lakes Protections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- A proposal announced Friday by the  
Environmental Protection Agency would prohibit the dumping of 
certain chemicals in parts of the Great Lakes and surrounding 
wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Each year, about 90,000 pounds of the most toxic chemicals,  
including mercury and PCBs, are discharged and diluted with the 
water of certain areas of the Great Lakes called mixing zones, the 
EPA says. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that when we protect the environment of the Great  
Lakes, we are protecting the health of our families and our 
economies,'' EPA administrator Carol Browner said to the 
International Joint Commission, formed to help the United States 
and Canada in decisions regarding shared waterways. 
</P>
<P>
	Browner proposed banning new mixing zones and phasing out the  
existing ones over 10 years in the Great Lakes basin, an area that 
encompasses the lakes and surrounding wetlands in eight states. 
</P>
<P>
	The chemicals, called bioaccumulative chemicals of concern, or  
BCCs, can move up the food chain, and will eventually affect 
humans, said Chuck Fox, EPA assistant administrator for water. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox estimated that there are about 300 mixing zones for BCCs in  
the basin, in industrial sections of rivers and at least a mile off 
the shore. ``Generally, people don't swim in this stuff,'' Fox 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would reduce by about 91 percent the 22 BCCs  
flowing into the Great Lakes from industry and municipal sewage 
treatment plants, Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
	An environmentalist say that while the EPA's proposal is good,  
it's overdue. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing it's taken them this long to do something when  
they've known about it for so long -- and they're still willing to 
give industry 10 years,'' Eric Uram, of the Sierra Club, said 
before Browner's speech. ``What happens in the meantime is more 
chemicals entering the Great Lakes and potentially affecting our 
health.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The governors of Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin  
already have started the process of eliminating mixing zones for 
BCCs in the basin, said Ken Wiesner, an assistant to the water 
division administrator for the state Department of Natural 
Resources. 
</P>
<P>
	The Great Lakes states also include Illinois, New York, Ohio,  
Pennslyvania.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Keep Raising 'Soft Money' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Democrats pushed to ban unlimited political  
contributions from businesses, unions and individuals, the party 
almost doubled the amount of so-called soft money it raised in the 
first six months of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic committees took in $26.4 million in unrestricted soft  
money contributions from January through June, up from $13.7 
million during the last comparable period, the first six months of 
1997. Republicans raised even more soft money -- $30.9 million -- in 
the first six months of the year, a 42 percent boost over 1997's 
$21.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But while most congressional Republicans oppose banning soft  
money, most House and Senate Democrats have lined up behind 
legislation to prevent parties from raising such unlimited 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	To the GOP, it reeks of hypocrisy. ``Bill Clinton and the  
Democrats preach about the evils of soft money by day and act like 
vacuum cleaners by night, sucking it all up,'' Republican National 
Chairman Jim Nicholson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholson has made no secret of his support for soft money. At a  
private meeting of the House GOP in August, Nicholson and Rep. Tom 
Davis of Virginia, chairman of the National Republican 
Congressional Committee, argued that such a ban would leave the 
party's candidates vulnerable to unlimited expenditures by labor 
unions and other groups that back Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Republican-controlled House passed a ban on soft  
money, 252-177, on Sept. 14. Of 210 Democrats, 197 voted for the 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats say they can't afford to give up soft money while the  
Republicans are raking it in. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we should make it illegal, but we should make it  
illegal for everyone,'' said Rep. Martin Meehan of Massachusetts, 
lead Democratic sponsor of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Parties can raise soft money for get-out-the-vote drives and  
other party-building activities. Since the money is not raised 
under federal rules, it cannot be used directly to help elect 
candidates. Increasingly, however, Democrats and Republicans spend 
millions of dollars of soft money on issue advertisements designed 
to help their nominees without specifically urging a vote for or 
against a particular candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee more than  
quadrupled its soft money contributions over the first half of 1997 
-- nearly closing a historic gap with its Republican counterpart. 
The DCCC took in $9 million during the first six months of 1999, 
compared with $1.9 million during the same period two years 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The NRCC took in $9.4 million in soft money during the first six  
months of 1999, a 79 percent increase over the same period in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	DCCC Chairman Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island said his committee  
has been criticizing House Republican policies to potential donors, 
while arguing that the Democrats will recapture the majority next 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to be back in the majority. Are you going to be  
with us or not?'' Kennedy said he tells prospective contributors. 
``All we need to do is get a fraction of what these people are 
giving to Republicans. They don't want the balance sheets to be so 
unbalanced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also topped Democrats in raising money under federal  
contribution limits. GOP committees took in $66.4 million, compared 
with $38.1 million for the Democrats.

<HEADLINE> Davis Still In Hunt for NFL Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Billionaire Marvin Davis remained in the game  
for an NFL franchise Friday without having to ante up again. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, who has approached the league about building a stadium at  
Hollywood Park, received an extension on a deadline for retaining 
his option on some 100 acres adjacent to the horse racing track. 
</P>
<P>
	He initially paid Hollywood Park Inc. $100,000 for the option.  
Renewing it through next March would cost him another $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The first option period was to have expired Friday. A  
spokeswoman for Davis said the extension was granted but would not 
disclose how long it runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' interest in the expansion team isn't the first time he  
has considered buying a sports franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	In previous years, he expressed interest in the Denver Broncos,  
the Dallas Cowboys and the Oakland Athletics, without consummating 
a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, reportedly weighing whether he would spend more than $1  
billion for a stadium and franchise fee, has come to be regarded as 
a window shopper who often walks away from deals. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his sports franchise quests, he also was involved  
in dead-end attempts to buy such companies as Carter Wallace and 
Mesa Inc., and the Desert Inn in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 74-year-old Davis has completed enough deals to put him  
in a tie for 63rd, with $3.5 billion, on Forbes magazine's list of 
richest Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	A shrewd sense of timing apparently has keyed much of his  
success; he made a lot of his money by selling oil properties 
before prices dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	In the mid-1980s, Davis also reportedly made $325 million when  
he sold Twentieth Century Fox to Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., and 
millions more when he sold the Beverly Hills Hotel to the Sultan of 
Brunei for $200 million after buying it a year earlier for $135 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis moved into contention for an NFL team after the league,  
which had been dealing exclusively with a backers of the Los 
Angeles Coliseum, opened the door for other LA groups or 
individuals to make proposals for the expansion franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston is still considered the favorite to get the expansion  
team, which may be decided at the league meetings that begin with a 
franchise committee meeting Oct. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Any serious bid by Davis would face several hurdles, including  
gaining the NFL's approval of Hollywood Park as a suitable site for 
a stadium, and approval of him as a prospective owner. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the Coliseum backers, construction tycoon Eli Broad,  
actually ranks ahead of Davis on Forbes' list; Broad tied for 48th 
with $4 billion.

<HEADLINE> Book Gives Reagan Blunt Appraisal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The author of Ronald Reagan's official  
biography thinks Nancy Reagan is ``going to be disturbed'' by his 
new book. 
</P>
<P>
	Biographer Edmund Morris' book ``Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald  
Reagan,'' credits Reagan with making a profound impact on the 
country and judges him to be a consequential leader. But leaked 
excerpts also betray the author's blunt appraisal of Reagan's state 
of mind as president and his frequent disengagement with the 
functions of his job. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris tells ``60 Minutes'', in a program to be broadcast  
Sunday, that he was surprised Mrs. Reagan did not ask to see a 
prepublication copy of the book, noting ``Nancy likes to be in on 
everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My guess is that she's going to be disturbed by it,'' Morris  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not hide the fact that Reagan was frequently an old,  
spaced-out man, inattentive to details. I do not disguise the fact 
that he was boring in private,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS on Thursday released a sample of the interview.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Reagan's office asked for questions to be submitted in  
writing and did not respond. She said earlier this week she had not 
seen the book. 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan himself has been silenced by Alzheimer's disease.  
</P>
<P>
	Morris said in earlier interviews Reagan's mental and physical  
health began declining after he was shot and seriously wounded in 
1981, but that he was not suggesting the president had Alzheimer's 
while in office. 
</P>
<P>
	Random House will release the book next Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Turner Revitalizes Downtown Atlanta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- With a new sports arena and a redesigned CNN  
Center that puts the news network in a fishbowl, Ted Turner is 
opening up his corner of the city and helping to make downtown a 
livelier place after dark. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 20 years this will be sort of like the Rockefeller Plaza of  
Atlanta,'' said Chris Nelson, a professor of city planning and 
public policy at Georgia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
	Philips Arena opened Sept. 18 next to CNN Center, which is, in  
turn, across the street from Centennial Olympic Park, the 
centerpiece of the 1996 Summer Games. The arena is the home of 
hockey's Thrashers and basketball's Hawks, both of which are owned 
by Turner. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the year, the makeover of CNN Center will be  
complete, with the tower's concrete facade replaced with green 
glass. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, the two projects cost $250 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Urban planners -- even those who are howling about the huge,  
six-story Philips Arena sign -- say the CNN Center redesign should 
help transform downtown Atlanta from a place that's abandoned at 
quitting time to one where people shop, eat, play and live after 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The CNN building was erected about 25 years ago. When the CNN  
founder moved his news operation there in 1987, there were only 
scruffy parking lots across the street. 
</P>
<P>
	Those lots have since been replaced by the 21-acre Centennial  
Olympic Park, which is emerging as downtown's No. 1 public 
gathering spot, with its open green spaces, brick walkways and a 
fountain in the shape of the Olympic rings. 
</P>
<P>
	``When this complex was built in the 1970s, it was meant to wall  
off downtown,'' said Janet Marie Smith, president of Turner Sports 
and Entertainment. ``We want you to be able to stand on the park 
and literally be able to look through CNN Center.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the CNN Center atrium, giant video screens have been hung  
to show off each of Turner's networks. Glass walls give visitors a 
better look inside the guts of the CNN studios. A giant world map 
is being built into the atrium floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every city needs some place you can show off to your  
Midwestern cousins when they come to town,'' Ms. Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Philips Arena, the main concourse will be open daily for  
tourists to browse its shops and restaurants. Turnstiles will be 
installed before concerts and sports events. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the Olympics, Turner -- who lives in an apartment  
atop CNN Center with wife Jane Fonda -- made his stand downtown 
while others were packing up and moving to the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	``He could've left a long time ago. So it's to his credit that  
he has helped in this whole revitalization effort,'' said Leon 
Eplan, Atlanta's planning commissioner for 10 years before the 1996 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	But such praise turns to scorn when it comes to the giant  
promotional sign Turner is erecting across from Centennial Park. 
</P>
<P>
	At 55 feet tall and 150 feet wide, the sign will include a  
Philips Arena logo, a giant video screen and a 25-foot clock on a 
silver background that spells ``ATLANTA.'' Editorials in the 
Atlanta newspapers have denounced it as a gimmicky electronic 
freak. 
</P>
<P>
	``To put such an outsized, commercial sign there cheapens that  
space,'' Eplan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner officials defend the sign by pointing out that its main  
purpose is to hide the big parking garage behind it.

<HEADLINE> Ariz. Gov. Will Not Endorse McCain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Arizona Sen. John McCain said Friday his home  
state's governor, Jane Hull, told him she will endorse his rival 
for the Republican presidential nomination, Texas Gov. George W. 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain has been counting on Arizona's early Republican primary  
Feb. 22 to boost his chances three weeks later in California, where 
he is campaigning with life-or-death fervor. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said he spoke with Mrs. Hull by telephone earlier Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	Bush is scheduled to make his first campaign stop in Arizona  
Tuesday and a source close to his campaign confirmed that Mrs. Hull 
planned to use the visit to announce her endorsement. Aides to her 
would not deny those plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Officially, the governor has not made an endorsement,'' said  
Francie Noyes, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Hull. ``She does have a 
meeting with Gov. Bush.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said he was disappointed by Mrs. Hull's decision but  
remained confident he could carry his home state, where he recently 
won his third Senate term by a wide margin. 
</P>
<P>
	``I consider Jane a friend and I will naturally continue to work  
with her on behalf of the people of Arizona,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other seekers of the Republican presidential nomination next  
year also have wooed Mrs. Hull. Former Vice President Dan Quayle, 
who now lives in Arizona and publisher Steve Forbes have met with 
her seeking support. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona's early primary makes the state attractive for  
candidates needing a springboard and for the front-running Bush, 
who would like to lock up the GOP nomination without an expensive 
fight.

<HEADLINE> IOC Official Criticizes US Drug Czar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A senior Olympic executive delivered a blunt  
message to the White House drug adviser: Crack down on drugs in pro 
sports in the United States instead of criticizing the 
International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the greatest of respect, your view is clearly wrong,''  
IOC vice president Dick Pound said in a letter to Barry McCaffrey, 
director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said he was troubled by McCaffrey's attacks on the IOC's  
plans for an anti-drug agency. McCaffrey said this week the project 
is unacceptable because it lacks accountability and independence. 
He called the IOC untrustworthy and ``Byzantine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a four-page letter, a copy of which was obtained Friday by  
The Associated Press, Pound urged McCaffrey to tackle the drug 
problem in his own back yard. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States ``could contribute a great deal ... were its  
own policies clear, unequivocal and fully implemented in its own 
territory,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound cited an ``enormous disconnect'' between McCaffrey's  
attacks on the IOC and the drug situation in professional sports in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Performance-enhancing drugs are widely used and apparently  
regularly tolerated,'' Pound said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC official also took another swipe at Mark McGwire, who  
acknowledged using androstenedione last season when he hit a record 
70 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some sports, the national icons freely admit to using drugs  
that are prohibited within the Olympic movement,'' Pound said. 
</P>
<P>
	Androstenedione, which is legal in major league baseball, is on  
the IOC's list of banned steroids. McGwire said earlier this season 
he had stopped using the product. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound suggested the anti-drug fight was being compromised in the  
United States by the threat of lawsuits against drug suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you wanted the U.S. to demonstrate leadership in this vital  
area, you could find a mechanism to insulate (international sports 
federations) from the ruinous exposure and expense that such 
lawsuits entail,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound also complained that the IOC had not received a reply to a  
letter it sent last May to McCaffrey and the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration expressing concern over the ineffective labeling of 
dietary supplements. Many of these supplements, available 
over-the-counter and advertised on the Internet, contain banned 
substances. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said he had hoped to discuss plans for the anti-drug  
agency in meetings with McCaffrey earlier this year. But he said 
two scheduled meetings were canceled by McCaffrey's staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been more helpful ... for you to have provided  
input regarding the international consensus than simply to 
criticize the valuable work that has been accomplished,'' Pound 
said. ``Casting doubt upon the genuineness of the commitment of 
those involved in the international effort is not helpful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said the framework for the agency had been backed by the  
European Union, United Nations, World Health Organization, Interpol 
and other bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	He reiterated that the IOC plans to set up the agency by the end  
of this year and have it in place for next year's Sydney Olympics. 
With the IOC putting up an initial $25 million in funding, the 
agency will coordinate drug-testing around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said it was agreed earlier this year that no single  
constituency would control the agency, that Olympic leaders and 
government officials would be equally represented. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the IOC is resolved to proceed ``with or without the  
participation of public authorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound defended the IOC's record on drugs, saying, ``No other  
organization in the world has done more than the IOC in the 
struggle against doping in sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the IOC has backed plans for unannounced  
out-of-competition tests, funded research into developing tests for 
EPO and human growth hormone, and promised to implement blood tests 
once a reliable analysis is established.

<HEADLINE> Nichols Seeks New Trial Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Bombing conspirator Terry Nichols has asked the  
10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to decide whether he deserves a 
new federal trial in the Oklahoma City bombing case. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch upheld the verdict last week,  
ruling that Nichols had not proven that the outcome of his trial 
would have been different if some additional information from the 
FBI had been turned over to defense attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	The notice of appeal, filed Wednesday, does not say what grounds  
Nichols will raise before the appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols was sentenced to life in prison for conspiracy and eight  
counts of involuntary manslaughter in the April 19, 1995, bombing 
of the federal building. The bombing killed 168 people and injured 
more than 500 others. 
</P>

murder.

<HEADLINE> Men executed in Delaware, N.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SMYRNA, Del. (AP) -- A man described by his lawyers as mentally  
retarded was executed by injection early Friday for the stabbing 
and beating death of an elderly greenhouse worker. 
</P>
<P>
	Willie Sullivan, 28, was pronounced dead at 12:24 a.m. He became  
the 10th person executed in Delaware since the state resumed 
capital punishment in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, in North Carolina, Harvey Lee Green was executed by  
injection at 2:16 a.m. for the beating deaths of two people. The 
38-year-old was the first black person executed in that state since 
it restored the death penalty in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delaware Board of Pardons refused to recommend commuting his  
death sentence on Tuesday. Sullivan's lawyers and family had argued 
that death was not justifiable because he is mentally retarded, 
with an IQ of 70, and has brain damage from Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan admitted he went to a Frederica, Del., nursery on Dec.  
17, 1991, to rob Maurice Dodd, 78. He said he used a metal potting 
soil scoop to beat the man and dropped a concrete block on his 
chest as he lay on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sullivan later insisted that he never stabbed Dodd. He said  
it was the work of an accomplice -- a claim investigators found no 
evidence to support. 
</P>
<P>
	Green was sent to death row for the killings of Sheila Bland, a  
dry cleaning store clerk, and Michael Edmundson, a customer. 
</P>
<P>
	Green's supporters contend he was a victim of racism during his  
trial because only one black person was on the jury that 
recommended the death penalty.

<HEADLINE> Dead Baby Found in Microwave Oven </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANEXA, Va. (AP) -- Authorities are investigating the death of a  
month-old baby found in a microwave oven in his parents' home. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors said they heard the father of Joseph Lewis Martinez  
screaming shortly before sheriff's deputies arrived at the house 
early Thursday. Lanexa is a rural community in New Kent County, 
about 35 miles east of Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was his pride and joy, that baby,'' said Steve Walker, a  
friend of father Joe Martinez, 18. 
</P>
<P>
	The microwave oven had been turned on, but no cause of death has  
been released. An autopsy was to be performed. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Sheriff Farrar W. Howard Jr., a deputy responded to  
a call at the home shortly before 6 a.m. about the baby being 
missing, and the body was found soon after the deputy arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard said both parents were at home when the deputy arrived.  
The couple shared the home with Martinez's sister, friends say. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's heartbreaking, it really is,'' said a sobbing Naomi  
Harris, a neighbor who has lived in the community for 25 years.

<HEADLINE> Booster Club Denies Excluding Woman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) -- They hoot when the Red Raiders win and  
holler like maniacs after a loss. 
</P>
<P>
	For 64 years, the rowdy and raucous Texas Tech Saddle Tramps  
have been known across West Texas as a famed and exclusive spirit 
club. And as far back as anyone can remember, the Tramps have only 
been men. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came Jennifer Slattery, the first woman ever to apply for  
membership. The Saddle Tramps say she wasn't denied admission this 
spring because she's a woman. But the 50-member group has applied 
for male-only legal designation that would exempt it from an 
anti-discrimination law. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy has evolved into a case of tradition versus  
tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure why this issue always has to come up,'' said Rick  
Murray, a member of the organization in 1957. ``It even comes up 
with the Boy Scouts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tramps executive board member Matthew Hines wouldn't comment on  
why Ms. Slattery was kept from joining but said the group doesn't 
exclude women. He said the group's meeting are private and that he 
is ``not allowed to discuss what goes on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have never discouraged females from coming to rushes,''  
Hines said. ``I have not noticed a lot of females ever being 
interested in joining. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a spirit organization here and we support male  
athletics. We have our own section in Jones Stadium provided by the 
athletic department. We ring bells, do chants and get everyone 
spirited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	None of which can't be done by a woman, Ms. Slattery argues.  
</P>
<P>
	``There really is no reason why a woman shouldn't be able to  
join,'' said the Tech junior. ``If they get single-sex status, I 
don't think it's fair they get my money or other females' money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Saddle Tramps receive about $2,000 a year in student fees,  
Tech officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials say the group may not discriminate against  
women -- or anyone else -- but added that there is no evidence Ms. 
Slattery was excluded because of her sex. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apparently there had been some incidents that occurred in  
which the female student made comments about the organization that 
made them feel she wasn't interested or didn't think much of the 
group,'' said Mike Shonrock, Tech's dean of students. 
</P>
<P>
	Hines said the group has asked the Internal Revenue Service to  
recognize it as an all-male organization, exempting it from the 
Title IX anti-discrimination law. The designation would allow the 
group to continue receiving public money. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Jacobsen, president of the American Civil Liberties Union,  
says a history as a single-sex group is no basis for an exemption. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea that a public group's history will allow them to be  
exempt from discrimination laws is ridiculous,'' Jacobsen said. 
``If they receive public money and make use of public resources 
then they will have to let women join.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Saddle Tramps are named after the colloquial expression for  
traveling ranchers for hire.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Markets Brace for Big Jolt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- The next big aftershock from Taiwan's  
killer quake may hit the Taipei Stock Exchange, where traders 
expect shares to fall as far as the rules allow when trading 
resumes Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has kept the market closed since disaster struck  
early Tuesday, taking more than 2,100 lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, many traders around the island could not work  
because their electronic dealing systems had no power. And there 
was little information available about damage sustained by listed 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	With the market preparing to reopen, the extent of the fallout  
is still far from clear. Analysts say the main question they have 
is not whether prices will be hurt, but how much. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clearly going to go down,'' said Peter Kurtz at  
investment bank Merrill Lynch in Taipei. ``You don't have a 7.6 
magnitude earthquake without having some impact in the economy and 
the stock market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Experts predict that many Taiwanese shares will fall by 7  
percent on Monday, the maximum one-day drop allowed under 
securities regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been speculation the government might try to limit any  
panic selling by temporarily changing the rules to permit a fall of 
no more than 3 percent, but exchange officials had made no such 
announcement by late Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	If prices go into a free fall, the government could intervene  
and buy shares with a so-called ``stabilization fund'' that has 
been used before to prop up plunging markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 300 billion Taiwanese dollars (almost $10 billion) is  
available in the fund, which includes some public pension money. 
Officials already have activated the fund several times this year. 
During the summer, they shored up a foundering market amid 
heightened Taiwan-China tensions. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, all eyes are on Taiwan's crucial high-technology  
sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Electronics products account for more than half of Taiwan's  
exports. The island is a huge provider of semiconductors, making 10 
percent of the world's chips and about 80 percent of the 
``motherboards'' used to run personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The semiconductor industry was shut down by power cuts brought  
on by the quake. But experts believe the factories sustained 
minimal damage because most are far from the quake's epicenter in 
central Taiwan, a mountainous area where farming is more important. 
</P>
<P>
	High-tech executives at some companies were able only Thursday  
to begin testing equipment. They hope to bring production gradually 
back online next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Don Floyd at Credit Lyonnais Securities believes many  
semiconductor shares will fall by the maximum 7 percent when 
trading resumes -- and possibly for more than one day. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a question of how many days of limit down,'' Floyd said.  
``You're looking at a substantial impact on earnings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trading could be erratic Monday, since power outages and cut  
phone lines in parts of Taiwan could make it impossible for some 
investors to trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Taipei's blue chip Weighted Stock Price Index was at 7,972.14  
when the quake struck -- up 19.5 percent on the year as optimism 
over export earnings outweighed concerns about recent tensions with 
China. 
</P>
<P>
	Any sharp falls could be perceived by some investors as buying  
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch's Kurtz said the likely market drop beginning  
Monday could be far worse than the actual negative impact on 
Taiwan's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be overreaction in the first few days,'' he said.  
``There will clearly be buyers. A lot of foreign institutions are 
looking to buy.''

<HEADLINE> Chicago Lyric, Met Swapping Operas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Staging the world premiere of an opera is hard  
enough. Keeping it alive after that first production can be even 
harder. 
</P>
<P>
	Now two of America's leading opera companies are helping to  
solve the problem -- by swapping operas. 
</P>
<P>
	William Bolcom's version of Arthur Miller's play ``A View From  
the Bridge'' will have its premiere at Chicago's Lyric Opera on 
Oct. 9. Then it will get a second production, at the Metropolitan 
Opera in New York, in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The Met has an opera premiere this season, too, an adaptation of  
F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel ``The Great Gatsby,'' by John Harbison, 
on Dec. 20. Next season, it will be presented at the Lyric. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, Bolcom's first opera for Lyric, ``McTeague,'' was  
widely praised at its premiere in 1992 but has since been presented 
just one other place, at Indiana University. And even that is one 
more production than most new American operas receive, because of 
the expense and the difficulties of attracting audiences to new 
works once the excitement of the premiere has worn off. 
</P>
<P>
	The new arrangement wasn't exactly entered into as a trade, said  
Susan Mathieson, director of marketing and communications for the 
Lyric. 
</P>
<P>
	``To my knowledge, we just decided we wanted to do this piece,''  
she said. ``You have to plan so far in advance with big companies 
these days. I'm sure this has been on the books at least three 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Clark, spokesman for the Met, said Thursday: ``I don't  
think there was a trade. They're doing ours and we're doing theirs. 
I don't know when it was decided here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mathieson, speaking by telephone from Chicago, said, ``We won't  
announce our complete next season until the beginning of December. 
We can't wait to see how it flies at the Met. We've signed a cast 
but it hasn't been announced. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our history of new works is seven to 10 performances in a  
season. Because we have a large subscription audience, we schedule 
so that everybody who has a full series -- eight operas is a full 
series -- gets to see the new work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lyric has presented the second production of a Met premiere  
opera once before, John Corigliano's ``The Ghosts of Versailles,'' 
which bowed at the Met in 1991, opened at Lyric in 1995 and then 
returned to the Met in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The Met has not previously performed an opera that had its world  
premiere in Chicago.

<HEADLINE> Dancer Mignon Garland Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN PABLO, Calif. (AP) -- Mignon Garland, a dancer who carried on  
the legacy of Isadora Duncan in the United States, has died at the 
age of 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Garland, who died Sept. 15, was founder and director of the  
Isadora Duncan Heritage Society. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan helped pioneer modern dance by turning away from ballet  
and looking to ancient Greece for inspiration. She died in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Garland, born in Brooklyn, N.Y., decided to devote her life  
to dance that year after attending a performance by Duncan's 
disciples. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1930s and 40s, Ms. Garland toured with the Minneapolis  
Symphony, danced in Moscow and New York, founded several dance 
companies and was dance editor of New Theater magazine. Later, she 
lived for many years in the San Francisco home where Ms. Duncan was 
born. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Garland helped drive a Duncan revival that began with the  
1977 centenary of her birth. She also trained many Duncan dancers 
performing today, including her granddaughter, Amy Baird Garlin, 
and Lori Belilove. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Garland is survived by son Victor Garlin, a sister and two  
granddaughters.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Backs Timor Rights Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The United States and other countries today threw  
their weight behind European demands for an international inquiry 
into atrocities committed in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	The draft resolution was made by the European Union and their  
East European allies at an emergency session of the U.N. Human 
Rights Commission, called at the request of Portugal, East Timor's 
former colonial power. 
</P>
<P>
	``The international community will exert every effort to ensure  
that those responsible are brought to justice,'' said the draft 
proposal. It condemns the widespread violations of human rights and 
the activities of militias terrorizing the population, and 
expresses concern at the ``desperate humanitarian situation of the 
East Timorese population.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nobel Laureate and East Timor resistance leader Jose Ramos Horta  
told the 53-nation commission that if it failed to act, it would be 
``an accomplice to impunity, an accomplice to genocide and war 
crimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ramos Horta compared the devastation of East Timor to the  
``wasteland'' of Europe after World War II and the destruction of 
Kuwait after the Iraqi occupation. 
</P>
<P>
	``My sentiments to the Republic of Indonesia are the same as the  
Jews toward Nazi Germany and the Kuwaitis toward Iraq,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed inquiry could be the first step towards the  
establishment of a U.N. criminal tribunal for East Timor and is 
supported by U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I have called for and what I discussed with (Indonesian)  
President (B.J.) Habibie is an international commission of inquiry, 
because before there can be a decision about an international 
tribunal I think it's important to gather in the facts, assess the 
degree of accountability,'' Robinson told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Ambassador George Moose told the meeting: ``The violent  
events that have occurred in East Timor require a systematic and 
credible investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is important to send a signal to all parts of the world  
that gross violations of human rights will not be tolerated,'' said 
Moose. 
</P>
<P>
	Mozambique, Slovenia, Norway and Switzerland made similar  
statements. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, speaking at the United  
Nations in New York on Thursday, rejected suggestions for an 
international investigation, saying Indonesia itself should first 
look into allegations of human rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission, which is meeting in special session for only the  
fourth time in its history, could decide to send investigators, and 
could also ask human rights envoys to report on the situation in 
East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Bishop Carlos Belo, who shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Ramos  
Horta in 1996, also called for an investigation.

<HEADLINE> `Third Man' Tops 100 British Films </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- ``The Third Man,'' a classic tale of intrigue set  
in post-World War II Vienna, has been named the best British film 
of the century in a poll announced this week by the British Film 
Industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Other films to make the top 10 ranged from Alfred Hitchcock's  
``The 39 Steps,'' at No. 4, to Nicholas Roeg's erotic chiller 
``Don't Look Now,'' at No. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	David Lean was responsible for three top citations, with ``Brief  
Encounter,'' ``Lawrence of Arabia'' and ``Great Expectations'' -- 
placing second, third and fifth, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Alec Guinness starred in more listed films than anyone else,  
with nine, while Michael Caine headlined in seven and Julie 
Christie starred in six. 
</P>
<P>
	The list was chosen by 1,000 people in the British film and  
television industries, who collectively cast 25,700 votes covering 
820 films. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Third Man,'' directed by Carol Reed, is a stylish 1949  
adaptation of a Graham Greene thriller. Filmed against a backdrop 
of ruined buildings and starring Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten, it 
contains some of cinema's most memorable black-and-white images. 
The background theme of zither music is so powerfully connected to 
the story that it is instantly recognized by anyone who has seen 
the film. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the results, the '60s were the evident golden age for  
British movies. Twenty-six films from that decade made the list, as 
opposed to 17 from the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one recent film made the top 10 -- ``Trainspotting,''  
director Danny Boyle's scabrous 1996 look at heroin addicts in 
Scotland. It is also movie that launched Ewan McGregor as an 
international name. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oscar-winning ``Shakespeare In Love,'' Shekhar Kapur's  
``Elizabeth'' and Ken Loach's ``My Name Is Joe'' were three other 
films from last year to make the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the choices may surprise Americans, since they  
include such films as ``The English Patient,'' ``Sense and 
Sensibility,'' and ``Shakespeare In Love,'' all of which were made 
either largely or wholly with American money. 
</P>
<P>
	But for the purposes of the poll, the industry qualified as a  
British film any movie employing a substantial number of Britons. 
All three of the movies named above used British talent who went on 
to win Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	While most of the films draw on original scripts, many are  
adaptations of novels and plays, reflecting Britain's rich literary 
heritage. Shakespeare, Dickens, Alan Bennett, and Graham Greene 
were among the authorial heavyweights to have made the list.

<HEADLINE> Bank of Scotland Bids for NatWest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Bank of Scotland PLC, casting itself as a tightly  
managed David out to conquer a flabby Goliath, on Friday launched a 
hostile $34.3 billion takeover bid for National Westminster Bank 
PLC. 
</P>
<P>
	NatWest, which is three times bigger than Bank of Scotland,  
quickly rejected the offer, and its shares soared as analysts 
speculated that other bidders might join the pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the offer would represent Britain's biggest bank  
merger, ``It's not a knockout bid. It's feasible someone could come 
in with a higher bid,'' said David Liston, analyst at Capel Cure 
Sharp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think they're paying enough. It's distinctly  
opportunistic'', said John Tyce, banking analyst at SG Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Burt, chief executive of Bank of Scotland, said his  
company first approached NatWest about a merger in 1997 but NatWest 
wasn't interested. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bank of Scotland has been growing since then and NatWest has  
been doing the opposite,'' Burt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Burt said Bank of Scotland decided to move after NatWest made a  
$17.7 billion offer to buy Legal &AMP; General Group PLC, an insurer 
and pension provider. Bank of Scotland said its offer was 
contingent on NatWest dropping that bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``NatWest has a history of under-performance,'' said Sir John  
Shaw, governor of the Bank of Scotland. ``Its proposed acquisition 
of Legal &AMP; General does not address NatWest's long-term problem -- 
its relative inability to extract value from its core banking 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that the NatWest business will prosper as part of a  
well-managed, focused group and that this bank-to-bank merger will 
enable Bank of Scotland to utilize its proven management skills to 
unlock substantial value for both sets of shareholders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NatWest responded that the offer ``does not reflect the value of  
the NatWest franchise and the NatWest Group as a whole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Scotland's offer valued NatWest at $20.55 a British  
share, representing a 20 percent premium over the closing price 
Thursday on the London Stock Exchange. But amid expectations of 
even bigger bids, NatWest Bank shares soared 29 percent on the 
London Stock Exchange to the equivalent of $22.21. 
</P>
<P>
	NatWest's U.S. shares rose 27.5 percent Friday on the New York  
Stock Exchange, surging $27.81 1/4 to close at $128.81 1/4 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of Scotland shares were up 6.2 percent in London, where  
Legal &AMP; General shares fell 6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, NatWest shareholders would receive 1.6 new Bank  
of Scotland shares plus notes for each NatWest share. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of Scotland said it intended to preserve NatWest's separate  
identity if its bid succeeds, but that it would sell noncore 
businesses and return cash to shareholders. It also said it 
expected the combined banks to be profitable from the start. 
</P>
<P>
	``This move is almost as defensive as it is aggressive; it's a  
good strategy play by a medium-sized bank,'' said Justin Urquhart 
Stewart, a strategist at Barclays Stockbrokers. 
</P>
<P>
	``One reason they're doing this is as a pre-emptive action; It  
moves their share price, it shows they're aggressive and gives out 
a clear message to anyone who may be thinking of it as a takeover 
target,'' Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of Scotland said its offer was an attractive alternative to  
NatWest's plans to acquire Legal &AMP; General. Some analysts 
criticized that deal as risky and expensive and shares in both 
companies fell after that deal was announced earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	In its offer Friday, Bank of Scotland insisted that NatWest drop  
the bid and it urged NatWest shareholders to vote against the Legal 
&AMP; General acquisition at an Oct. 6 shareholder meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I were a NatWest shareholder, I would prefer the Bank of  
Scotland proposal'' to the Legal &AMP; General bid, said Martin Cross, 
banking analyst at broker Teather &AMP; Greenwood. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the proposal by Bank of Scotland to acquire NatWest is  
attractive enough to persuade NatWest shareholders to vote against 
the Legal &AMP; General deal''. 
</P>
<P>
	NatWest had assets of $306 billion and pretax profits of $3.5  
billion last year. It has 1,730 branches and 64,400 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of Scotland reported assets of $90 billion and pretax  
profits of $1.2 billion in 1998. It has 325 branches and 21,000 
employees. 
</P>

	Earlier this year, Bank of Scotland backed out of a deal with  
U.S. religious broadcaster Pat Robertson to launch a telephone 
banking service in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	That deal died after Robertson, based in Virginia Beach, Va.,  
criticized Scotland as ``a rather dark land'' that tolerates 
homosexuality. On his ``700 Club'' broadcast, Robertson said, ``in 
Scotland, you can't believe how strong the homosexuals are. It's 
just unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Scotland apologized to its shareholders in June,  
saying it had been a mistake to get involved with Robertson.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A woman driving out of a midtown Manhattan  
parking garage lost control of her car and smashed through the 
front of a restaurant, killing one person and injuring more than 20 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were sprawled all over,'' said firefighter Brian  
Kearney. ``It was unbelievable -- it's the worst I've ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mercedes-Benz driven by Marcia Feltingoff, 51, of West New  
York, N.J., accelerated suddenly Thursday evening and plowed 
through Arno, striking patrons before coming to a rest against the 
restaurant's rear wall, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She came through the barrier ... then, like out of a movie,  
went through the front of the restaurant,'' said witness Mike 
McCormack. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear what caused the accident and there were no  
immediate arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	Cirel Truch, 62, of New Jersey, was pronounced dead after  
suffering a heart attack and head wounds. Seventeen of the injured 
patrons were transported to hospitals for treatment.

<HEADLINE> New Phenom on Stage at Ryder Cup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- Two years ago, a young rookie of immense  
talent was supposed to help a U.S. team reclaim the Ryder Cup at 
Valderrama in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Woods went 1-3-1 instead, finding out in the process that  
playing for national pride isn't the same as playing for cash. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the new phenom is on the other side. And how Sergio  
Garcia handles the pressure of his first Ryder Cup might be a key 
to whether the Europeans can retain the cup once again. 
</P>
<P>
	It won't take long to find out, with Garcia paired against Woods  
in alternate shot competition today as the 33rd Ryder Cup opens at 
The Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
	The rivalry that got its start last month at the PGA  
Championship could be in full bloom by the time the cup is decided 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't wait,'' Woods said Thursday after the pairings were  
announced. ``I know my experience from the last Ryder Cup is 
definitely going to help me deal with the nerves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The matchup that golf fans wanted to see came early when  
captains on both sides picked Garcia and Woods for the second 
alternate shot foursome of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not a pure meeting, though, as Woods will share his shots  
with Tom Lehman and Garcia will alternate with Jesper Parnevik. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not what the media is speculating. I know they want to  
see us play head-to-head,'' Woods said. ``But it's not necessarily 
head-to-head. We have to rely directly on our partners now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though not be head-to-head, the match is pretty good for Ryder  
Cup starters. Both Woods and Garcia figure to play in five matches 
each, giving them four more possibilities of being paired in the 
blind draws. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though it's a team format, Sergio and Tiger going at it  
is a golf fan's dream,'' Lehman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia said after the PGA that he wanted to play against Woods  
in the Ryder Cup. His focus now, though, has changed to simply 
winning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be nice,'' Garcia said. ``But what I have in my mind  
is to help the European team try to win the cup, and I don't care 
if I'm going to play with Tiger or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods was a 21-year-old with less than a full year as a pro when  
he bore the weight of the American cause at Valderrama. 
</P>
<P>
	He played sporadically, though, and was routed 4 and 2 by  
Italy's Constantino Rocca in Sunday's singles in a match that might 
have given the United States the cup if he could have won. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just didn't hit the shots at the right time. I didn't make  
the putts,'' Woods said. ``But this year I'm coming into the 
tournament with more of a positive attitude and rightfully so. It 
suits my game because it is match play. I absolutely love it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia is the young rookie this time, a 19-year-old who won his  
way onto the European team in a burst of fine play after turning 
pro just after the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	He plays with abandon, much like countryman Seve Ballesteros,  
and seemed to enjoy himself immensely when he got within a shot of 
Woods on the back nine at Medinah and nearly beat him for the PGA 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have all seen his play,'' fellow Spaniard Jose Maria  
Olazabal said. ``For a guy that is 19 years old and has played 
five, six months as a professional, he has done a hell of a job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia is one of seven Ryder Cup rookies on the European team,  
which has lost the cup to the Americans only twice in the last 
seven competitions. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, David Duval is the only rookie on the American team  
-- and he's the No. 2 player in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval, though, has been on two President's Cup teams. One was a  
winning effort, the other ended in a loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody understands what they're trying to  
accomplish this week,'' Duval said. 
</P>
<P>
	Four days of attending team dinners and various entertainment  
events ended Thursday with opening ceremonies under breezy and 
sunny conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	That left players with only one final night of worrying about  
the excruciating pressure of the Ryder Cup and what kind of shot 
they might hit off the first tee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited and ready to get started,'' Hal Sutton said.  
``We've been here long enough practicing. It's time to get this 
thing underway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal, who was left out of the first morning's matches after  
telling European captain Mark James that his game wasn't good 
enough for the alternate shot format, planned to spend his time 
instead talking to Garcia and other rookies about how to handle 
first tee jitters. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time in six Ryder Cups that Olazabal has missed  
a match. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to be nervous on the first tee like everybody  
else,'' Olazabal said. ``But mainly they need to be patient. Don't 
try to push things around. Just try to be patient and play the 
game.''

<HEADLINE> Colombia Defends Peso </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Seeking to prop up a faltering economy,  
Colombia's central bank sold U.S. dollars Friday to defend the peso 
against speculators, while finance officials negotiated a major 
loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	President Andres Pastrana is counting on the loan to help him  
reverse Colombia's worst economic decline since the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colombian peso closed at 1994.5 to the dollar after the  
central bank sold $182.8 million worth of currency reserves. 
Friday's intervention brought to more than $400 million the amount 
the bank spent this week to defend the peso. 
</P>
<P>
	The currency has lost a third of its value against the dollar in  
the past twelve months, despite a government policy -- widely 
ridiculed by economists -- of trying to maintain the peso within a 
controlled trading range. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Finance Minister Juan Camilo Restrepo and Central  
Bank President Miguel Urrutia were in Washington trying to seal an 
expected $3 billion loan from the IMF. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombia's economic slide is aggravating tensions in a country  
whose steady economy had been a stabilizing force during decades of 
political violence. The economy contracted by nearly 7 percent in 
the first half of the year, and unemployment is about 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to a business group Thursday, Pastrana said the economy  
was ``finishing its desert crossing.'' Private economists are 
dubious, citing a large budget deficit, lagging industrial 
production figures and weak coffee production.

<HEADLINE> Ex-POWs in Belgrade Leaving Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two American soldiers who were formerly  
prisoners of war in Yugoslavia are getting out the Army. 
</P>
<P>
	Staff Sgt. Christopher Stone and Spc. Steven Gonzales had run  
into red tape after their resignations were cleared quickly through 
Army Command in Europe in July. The paperwork sat at the Pentagon 
for 1 1/2 months, and top Army officials there could not tell them if 
they would be allowed to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	They were given the go-ahead this week. ``Their resignations  
have been approved. It is official,'' Army spokeswoman Martha Rudd 
said Thursday from the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	During their 32 days of captivity, Stone and Gonzales, along  
with a third soldier, Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez, endured beatings, 
interrogations and deaths threats. The three Americans were 
released May 2, seven weeks before the NATO bombings in Yugoslavia 
ended, and welcomed home as heroes. 
</P>
<P>
	The experience changed their priorities, turning the soldiers  
who had re-enlisted into men intent on quitting the Army so they 
could get college educations and rebuild their lives, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The soldiers said their division commander and other Army  
officials had told them after their captivity that they would get 
their choice of assignments -- including resigning from the 
active-duty military. 
</P>
<P>
	Their release date was set for Oct. 22, Rudd said, but the Army  
could allow the soldiers to leave earlier if they have vacation 
time remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're ecstatic. The family is very happy,'' said the  
mother-in-law of Stone's sister, Dorcas Reliford, from her home in 
Riley Center, Mich., northeast of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's what he needs -- to get on with his life,'' said Manny  
Ramos, Stone's brother-in-law, in Lapeer, Mich. ``We're happy for 
them both. They went through a rough time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The soldiers were ambushed on March 31 by about 20 Serb soldiers  
near the Macedonian border, where they were on lightly armed patrol 
in a Humvee vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	During their first week of captivity, the soldiers were hooded  
and handcuffed with legs bound, forced to lie on one side without 
moving except to eat their one meal or make their only bathroom 
trip for the day, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone and Gonzales, both in Germany with the 1st Infantry  
Division, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	But they have said they are eager to return to their home states  
and begin to rebuild their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone, 25, said he plans to join the National Guard in Michigan  
and attend a state college. Gonzales, 22, said he wants to attend 
Texas A&AMP;M and join the reserves or National Guard. Both soldiers 
have been offered scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez, 24, has been granted a transfer to Fort Irwin near  
Barstow, Calif., where he will finish his time in the Army near 
relatives in Los Angeles before planning to go to college. He 
transfers on Oct. 3.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Gives NATO Commander Citation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the second time in recent weeks, the  
Pentagon had a surprise for Army Gen. Wesley Clark, the NATO 
commander who oversaw the alliance's successful air war over 
Kosovo. But Friday's was more pleasant than word Clark got in late 
July that he would be leaving his post early. 
</P>
<P>
	This time it was what Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon called a  
``surprise citation'': a Defense Distinguished Service Medal 
awarded Clark by Defense Secretary William Cohen in a private 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	The medal is the Pentagon's highest noncombat award. Norman  
Schwarzkopf, the retired Army general, received one for commanding 
allied forces in the 1991 Persian Gulf War, as did Joint Chiefs of 
Staff Chairman Gen. Henry H. Shelton for leading American troops in 
the near-invasion of Haiti in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The official citation accompanying Clark's award praised him for  
``decisive leadership and sound policy decisions'' and cited his 
``diplomatic, political and military acumen as well as his personal 
command presence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It has been reported that Clark's behind-the-scenes advocacy of  
preparing for a possible NATO ground invasion of Kosovo was a 
source of friction with Cohen and Shelton, who were reluctant to 
send in troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark was told in a surprise phone call from Shelton in late  
July that he would be leaving his post as NATO supreme commander 
and as commander of the U.S. European Command two months early next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been widely reported -- but denied by Cohen and President  
Clinton -- that Clark was forced out early because of 
dissatisfaction with how he prosecuted the war over Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Hospitals Treating Floyd Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- North Carolina residents are keeping  
emergency room doctors busy with cuts, bites, stings, diarrhea and 
nausea as they clean up in the wake of Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	People are fumbling with chainsaws, bees and mosquitoes are  
swarming, and floodwaters are teeming with bacteria, sewage and 
chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been quite busy, day and night,'' Dr. Cathy Dover, an  
emergency medicine physician at Lenoir County Memorial Hospital, 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, especially due to the flooding, we are seeing more nausea  
and diarrhea, from drinking contaminated water, most likely. We're 
also seeing a lot of rashes, poison ivy, a lot of fire ant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sewage treatment plants and lagoons of hog waste have overflowed  
and contaminated drinking water supplies. Farm and industrial 
chemicals have also flowed into the water. In some places, people 
will have to drink bottled water or boil tap water for weeks to 
come. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, there have been no outbreaks of infectious disease. The  
federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is helping the 
state Health Department keep watch so that they can stamp out an 
outbreak as soon as it happens. 
</P>
<P>
	Nash General Hospital doctors have treated two snakebites. At  
Pitt County Memorial Hospital, doctors are seeing more people stung 
by bees as they try to clear away brush and other debris. Other 
patients have cut or punctured themselves with chainsaws and other 
things and have gotten tetanus shots to ward off infection. 
</P>
<P>
	A big problem is expected to emerge over the weekend --  
mosquitoes, which breed in standing water and can spread deadly 
encephalitis to animals and humans. Planes are scheduled to start 
spraying pesticides late next week. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, mold growing in soggy furniture and carpeting could  
worsen allergies and asthma. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of thousands of dead hogs, chickens and turkeys pose a  
health threat because they attract flies. Incinerators are being 
used to burn the carcasses, but many areas with dead livestock 
remain blocked by water. 
</P>
<P>
	State health officials are trying to stop flies from spreading  
by sprinkling piles of carcasses with insecticides that kill 
maggots.

<HEADLINE> Author Accused of Stealing Ideas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A woman claims that Richard Paul Evans  
stole ideas from her manuscript for his 1998 best-selling novel, 
``The Locket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit filed by Leisa Hancock accuses Evans of using  
``distinctive sequences of events, distinctive locale, similarity 
of characters, similar plot and other original ideas'' in 
``Laurel,'' her unpublished novel. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans denied stealing Ms. Hancock's ideas or ever meeting her.  
</P>
<P>
	``We don't see any infringement here. What I would suggest is  
that you read both books and you will reach the same conclusion,'' 
said Thomas Vuksinick, Evans' attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hancock said she gave Evans a copy of her manuscript at a  
1995 writers conference in Provo and asked him to read it.

<HEADLINE> AL Umpire Suspended Three Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- John Shulock became the second umpire to be  
disciplined this season when he was suspended by the American 
League today for three games for his ``display of temper'' in a 
game this week. 
</P>
<P>
	AL president Gene Budig, in his first major decision since being  
told his position was being terminated by commissioner Bud Selig, 
suspended Shulock for the final three games his crew is to work 
this season and fined him an undisclosed amount. 
</P>
<P>
	The penalties were levied, Budig said, for Shulock's ``overly  
aggressive behavior, display of temper, inappropriate remarks and 
physical contact'' with Tampa Bay catcher Mike DeFelice during and 
following the Devils Rays' game against the Anaheim Angels on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shulock apparently became upset with DeFelice during the third  
inning of the Angels' 10-5 victory, a game in which the Devil Rays 
complained about the umpire's ball and strike calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The trouble began when Devils Rays pitcher Wilson Alvarez threw  
a fastball that struck Shulock in the mask. DeFelice barely raised 
his mitt to catch the pitch, and the ball squarely struck Shulock. 
</P>
<P>
	Shulock, unhurt, straightened up and slowly headed toward the  
mound. DeFelice caught up with the umpire as Tampa Bay manager 
Larry Rothschild came out of the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	Shulock and Alvarez argued briefly, but the umpire did not eject  
the pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, Shulock said, ``The more I think about it, I  
think he (Alvarez) did it intentionally. I can't prove it, but I'm 
upset, and I have a right to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the season, National League umpire Tom Hallion was  
suspended for three games without pay for allegedly bumping 
Colorado catcher Jeff Reed and pitching coach Milt May. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Tata, working the game with Hallion, denied Hallion had  
made contact with Reed and May. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball officials couldn't recall another suspension of an  
umpire for an on-field dispute.

<HEADLINE> MCI WorldCom May Buy Sprint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Will three be a charm for MCI WorldCom?  
</P>
<P>
	The nation's second biggest long-distance company has failed  
twice this year to acquire a wireless phone company. Now MCI 
WorldCom is said to be eyeing Sprint, the No. 3 long-distance 
company and parent of the Sprint PCS mobile phone business. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom and Sprint both declined to comment following a  
report on Friday in The Wall Street Journal saying the companies 
have discussed a merger. 
</P>
<P>
	If MCI WorldCom can bring Sprint to the altar, the merger would  
make a stronger No. 2 in long distance to AT&AMP;T Corp. and finally 
give WorldCom a foothold in the fast-growing wireless business. 
Sprint PCS has 4 million wireless customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not surprised that MCI WorldCom is making this move  
because of the void in their wireless space. Sprint would give them 
the capability,'' said Liza Henderson, a director with TeleChoice 
Inc., a Boston-based consulting company. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, MCI WorldCom made an overture to acquire  
AirTouch Communications, but was trumped by Vodafone PLC of 
Britain. MCI WorldCom then started negotiating with Nextel 
Communications, but those talks fell apart in May in a dispute over 
price. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after, MCI WorldCom chief executive Bernard Ebbers told  
investors he expected to get into the wireless business within a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ebbers is worried that another big merger like last year's  
acquisition of MCI, paid for by issuing billions of dollars worth 
of new stock, will dilute the value of MCI WorldCom's shares. 
</P>
<P>
	But his delays may prove costly because the explosive growth of  
the wireless business is a popular theme on Wall Street. At last 
count, the number of wireless customers in the United States 
totaled 79 million, up from 16 million in 1993, according to the 
Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Notably, Nextel's stock has nearly doubled to about $65 a share  
since talks with MCI WorldCom ended. And last week, Bell Atlantic 
struck an agreement to acquire the U.S. mobile phone network of 
Vodafone AirTouch in a deal that will create the nation's largest 
wireless phone company with 20 million customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, MCI WorldCom and Sprint would control about 30 percent  
of the U.S. consumer long-distance market, still far behind AT&AMP;T's 
60 percent share. 
</P>
<P>
	No deal between MCI WorldCom and Sprint appears imminent, and  
any alliance would face tough scrutiny from regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Another obstacle could come from France Telecom and Germany's  
Deutsche Telekom AG, which each own 10 percent of Sprint and are 
partners with Sprint in Global One, a struggling international 
venture. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint, based in Westwood, Kan., has a stock market value of  
nearly $40 billion, while its PCS wireless business, which is 
represented by a separate tracking stock, is valued at about $33 
billion. The market value for MCI WorldCom, based in Clinton, 
Miss., is about $151 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In Friday's trading, MCI WorldCom fell $2.37 1/2 per share to  
$76.12 1/2 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Sprint's stock rose $2.87 1/2 to 
$54 and Sprint PCS fell $1 to $73.50, both on the New York Stock 
Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Co.: More Genes Exist Than Thought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- One of the groups racing to map every human  
gene says there are thousands more than previously thought -- a 
daunting prospect for scientists trying to unravel genetic 
disorders. 
</P>
<P>
	There are about 140,000 genes making the proteins that program  
cells in the human body, say researchers at Incyte Pharmaceuticals 
Inc. Previous estimates put that number between 80,000 and 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It simply means the human genome is probably more complex than  
previously predicted,'' Randy Scott, president of the Palo 
Alto-based company, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	While some inherited disorders are caused by single genes, other  
diseases seem to result from groups of genes. Research into these 
diseases will be more difficult if there are more genes, since 
there could be more possible interactions between them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's more of a job. Finding the genes in simply inherited  
disorders like Huntington's disease, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell 
anemia, has been relatively simple,'' said Victor McKusick, a 
genetics professor at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``The focus now is on common disorders -- high blood pressure,  
asthma -- in which it isn't just one gene but a whole cadre that 
cause the disorder,'' he said. ``That's already a very complex 
problem to tackle. If there are more genes it will complicate that 
issue appreciably.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists are fairly certain that the entire human genome  
includes about 3 billion base pairs of DNA molecules. However, the 
number of genes -- each a particular sequence of DNA -- has always 
been an estimate. Biologists cannot yet tell exactly where one 
sequence ends and another begins in the strands of molecules. 
</P>
<P>
	Incyte scientists came up with the new estimate by combining  
data from two decoding methods. 
</P>
<P>
	In one, they decoded the heads and tails of transcribed copies  
of DNA, known as RNA, and determined there were 130,000 genes in 
the genome. In the second method, based on a feature that occurs in 
about half of known genes, they calculated 143,000 genes in every 
human cell. The two figures produced the 140,000 estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	Adam Felsenfeld, a scientist with the National Human Genome  
Research Institute, said the new gene estimate does not change the 
3 billion estimate for the number of base pairs of DNA molecules. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald Rubin, who leads a federally funded consortium at the  
University of California, Berkeley working to map the fruit fly's 
much smaller genome, said he believes scientists do not yet have 
definitive information on the number of human genes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the jury is still out on what the real number is,'' he  
said, adding that if 140,000 is accurate, ``it is surprisingly 
high.''

<HEADLINE> DiCaprio Settles $10M Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Leonardo DiCaprio and fellow actor Tobey  
Maguire have settled a $10 million lawsuit that accused them of 
trying to block the release of an independent film they appeared 
in. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement announced Friday, the film will be  
distributed outside the United States, Canada and their 
territories, but will not be shown commercially in the United 
States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	David Stuman, who produced the low-budget, black-and-white film  
titled ``Don's Plum,'' alleged that DiCaprio and Maguire used 
DiCaprio's superstar status to block distribution of the 1995 film 
because Maguire, who starred in ``Pleasantville,'' was displeased 
with his performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Through a publicist's statement last year, the defendants said  
they made the film as a ``favor to a friend'' and did so under the 
agreement that it would never be promoted as a ``feature-length 
motion picture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The short film is about a group of young people who meet at a  
diner one night for coffee to discuss various subjects.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Deck Cleaner Being Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The possibility of eye or skin injuries has  
forced the recall of some 420,000 bottles of Olympic Deck Cleaner. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission says jugs of the  
cleaner may be sealed with caps that dangerously affect the air 
pressure inside the container. 
</P>
<P>
	Caps used by the manufacturer can permit air pressure to build  
up and be expelled once the lids are removed, the commission said 
Thursday. Contact with the cleaner can cause eye damage or skin 
irritation. 
</P>
<P>
	A consumer and three stores have contacted the cleaner's  
manufacturer, PPG Architectural Finishes, about bulging or seeping 
containers but no injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The recalled Olympic Deck Cleaner was sold in plastic one- and  
2.5-gallon containers with green caps. Jugs with beige-colored caps 
were not affected. 
</P>
<P>
	The recalled deck cleaners have batch codes beginning with 06C,  
07C, 08C, 09C, 10C, 11C, 12C, 01D, 02D, 03D, 04D, 05D and 06D. They 
were sold at home improvement centers, hardware stores and lumber 
yards nationwide from June 1998 through June 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers with the unused containers should not open them. They  
may call PPGAF at (888) 774-7332 between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. EDT 
weekdays for information about getting a free replacement cap.

<HEADLINE> Social Security Statements Coming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Social Security will begin mailing annual  
statements to 125 million working Americans beginning Oct. 1, 
telling many for the first time how much they've paid into the 
nation's retirement system and what they can expect to get back. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hoping it will help people understand what Social  
Security can provide, but also encourage them to do further 
planning for retirement savings,'' said commissioner Kenneth S. 
Apfel. ``It's hard to live just on Social Security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, the Social Security statements have been available  
upon request, and 37 million Americans have asked for theirs since 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting Oct. 1, the personalized letters will be mailed  
automatically, in batches of 500,000 a day, timed so that every 
worker over age 25 will receive an updated one each year about 
three months before his or her birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress voted in 1989 to require the mailings, which at 56  
cents a letter will cost about $70 million a year. Because of the 
personal nature of the information, Social Security officials said 
the letters will be mailed first class. 
</P>
<P>
	Commercial Data Center Inc., a printing company located outside  
Dayton, Ohio, which got the contract for the job has hired 20 new 
employees and will be dropping off 40,000 pounds of mail a day at 
the city's airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Not even the Internal Revenue Service does a bigger mailing to  
American households each year when tax forms go out. 
</P>
<P>
	The Social Security Administration has been gearing up for the  
enormous task since 1995, by sending sample statements to about 73 
million people, most over age 40. The statements have been 
simplified during the course of the test to a four-page format that 
includes: 
</P>
<P>
	--A two-column chart showing annual earnings for each year  
subject to Social Security and Medicare taxes from a person's first 
job to 1998. These numbers are significant because the amount of 
future Social Security benefits depend, in part, on a person's past 
earnings and tax contributions. In 1998, all earnings were subject 
to a 1.45 percent Medicare payroll tax and earnings up to $68,400 
were subject to a 6.2 percent Social Security tax. 
</P>
<P>
	--The total amount of taxes a person has paid into the retirement  
system over the years, and separately, what his or her employers 
have paid. Employers must match employees' Social Security and 
Medicare contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	--Estimates of monthly retirement benefits assuming a person  
continued earning at his or her current salary level until retiring 
early at age 62; on time at 65, 66 or 67; or late at age 70. The 
age of eligibility for full Social Security benefits is scheduled 
to rise incrementally to 67 from 65. Those who choose to retire 
even later get higher monthly benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	--Estimates of monthly disability benefits if a worker became  
disabled today. 
</P>
<P>
	--Estimates of survivors benefits a worker's family would receive  
if the worker died this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter also gives a toll-free telephone number that people  
are urged to call if they find mistakes in their statements. Social 
Security officials expect to get about 233,000 such calls during 
the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
	Some getting the new statements may be pleasantly surprised to  
discover that Social Security provides financial protection for the 
young as well as the old. Polls have shown that the program's 
disability and survivor benefits are not widely understood. 
</P>
<P>
	For many, however, the statements are likely to be a ``wake-up  
call,'' showing just how modest a retirement income Social Security 
provides, said Don Blandin, president of the American Savings 
Education Council. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a very important line in the letter: 'Social Security  
benefits were not intended to be the only source of income for you 
and your family when you retire,''' said Blandin, whose group runs 
a public service campaign encouraging people to save. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial planners generally tell working people that they will  
need about 70 percent of their present income to live comfortably 
when they retire. For average earners, Social Security benefits 
will replace only about 40 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Social Security's own looming financial problems are also  
acknowledged in the letters. The program is expected to run short 
of cash in 2034, and lawmakers remain sharply divided over the best 
remedy. 
</P>
<P>
	In an introductory message to the new statements, Apfel says,  
``The program has changed in the past to meet the demands of the 
times and must do so again.''

<HEADLINE> Moseley-Braun New Zealand Bound? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Barring any last-minute hitches, controversial  
former Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun appears on her way to becoming the 
next U.S. ambassador to New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman David Leavy said Friday he did not know if  
the final green-light from the New Zealand government had been 
received for Moseley-Braun's nomination. That would be the last 
step before President Clinton would make the formal announcement of 
her as his choice for the post. 
</P>
<P>
	Moseley-Braun did not immediately return a message left at her  
Chicago home. But earlier this month, she said she was thrilled at 
the prospect of taking the job. ``I just would love it,'' she said. 
``It sounds like a magical place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Illinois Democrat became the nation's first black female  
senator in 1992, but was defeated in her 1998 re-election bid by 
Republican Peter Fitzgerald, who used his personal wealth to attack 
her on several controversies that had surrounded her during her 
term. She was heavily criticized for a 1996 visit to a Nigerian 
dictator and never-proven allegations that she used 1993 campaign 
funds to pay for personal luxuries. 
</P>
<P>
	She was unsuccessful despite the White House's eagerness to see  
her win. Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and first lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton each headlined several fund-raisers and campaigned 
repeatedly for Moseley-Braun for more than a year leading up to the 
election. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House first raised the New Zealand ambassadorship with  
her last December, shortly after her loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Since leaving office, she has spent time on the lecture circuit  
and worked part-time for the Clinton administration's push to use 
more federal dollars to rebuild public school buildings. The 
$56-an-hour job for the Education Department involves giving 
speeches to boost the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Moseley-Braun was the lead supporter in Congress of a bill to  
provide $22 billion to build and modernize 5,000 schools nationwide 
over two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Ambassadorial nominations must be approved by the Senate.  
</P>
<P>
	The current U.S. ambassador, Josiah Beeman, is nearly two years  
beyond his term, but has stayed as a favor to Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Veto Raises Questions About Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton bundled his veto of the $792  
billion Republican tax cut bill with a call to Congress for a 
year-end compromise on spending, Medicare, Social Security, debt 
repayment and -- finally -- limited middle class tax relief. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a suggestion for a summit that GOP leaders hope to avoid.  
</P>
<P>
	``If he wants to engage us he hasn't given any indication,''  
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., responded coolly, 
shortly after Clinton's veto ceremony Thursday. Lott said he has 
spoken with the president only once since mid-July, and that was to 
discuss East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., renewed the Republican  
determination to put the tax relief argument aside for the time 
being. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the GOP plan is to pass the regular spending bills  
needed to keep the government functioning. Anticipating a clutch of 
vetoes, they will then challenge Clinton to say how he proposes to 
pay for higher spending without raising taxes or dipping into the 
Social Security trust fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to take money out of Social Security. We're  
going to balance the budget. We're going to give him a budget that 
he can sign or veto, and tell us why. And we're not going to raise 
taxes on the American people,'' Hastert said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans' decision to avoid the sort of complex,  
multi-issue negotiations that Clinton suggested stems from both 
fear and hope. 
</P>
<P>
	It's an article of faith among Republicans that they have been  
outmaneuvered time and again by Clinton in year-end negotiations. 
They still bear the political scars of two government shutdowns in 
the winter of 1995-1996. They also recall the massive spending 
increase they swallowed in last fall's closed-door negotiations 
with the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Lott emphatically told fellow Republicans at a  
recent closed-door meeting that there will be no summit with the 
White House. Any vetoed spending bill would be resolved by the 
lawmakers whose committee assignments give them jurisdiction, and 
White House aides would wait outside, said sources who attended the 
meeting and spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The hope behind the Republican strategy is that the tax cut  
issue will work in the GOP's favor in the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Numerous outside advisers, including former Republican National  
Chairman Haley Barbour, have urged Hastert and Lott privately to 
resist any temptation to reduce the tax cut to gain Clinton's 
signature. That deprives Vice President Al Gore of any part in a 
Rose Garden signing ceremony, the theory goes, and gives Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush, the front-running GOP presidential candidate, 
plenty of leeway to craft his own economic platform. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll tell you, this Congress is not going to throw in the  
towel on tax relief for the American people,'' Hastert told 
reporters Thursday. But aides said he was referring to next year, 
when Republicans may well produce another large tax cut -- and 
another veto stand-off -- closer to the election. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's message was different, even as he denounced a  
``bloated'' tax cut bill he was rejecting. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the days ahead, I will ask the Republican majority to work  
with me to fulfill these fundamental obligations'' relating to 
Social Security, Medicare and other issues, he said. ``If we can 
work together to meet these objectives, we can also work together 
to pass tax relief we can afford -- affordable, middle-class tax 
relief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans can ill afford politically to snub the president, so  
they'll try to refocus the debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be glad to work together on tax relief, but we're not  
going to tie it in with spending,'' said Rep. Tillie Fowler of 
Florida, a member of the House GOP leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton has more weapons at his disposal than mere rhetoric  
as he seeks to advance his objectives. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House upped the ante Friday when Clinton's aides  
relayed word that he would veto a minor tax bill extending certain 
politically popular tax breaks, contending they would soak up a 
portion of the budget surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is becoming painfully clear that the only specific priority  
for the president this fall is higher and higher Washington 
spending,'' said Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, chairman of the House 
Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether Archer is right or wrong about that, he and fellow  
Republicans will likely soon find themselves discussing taxes and 
spending with Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Utah Doctor Charged With Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A doctor already charged with five counts  
of murder is now facing 22 counts of fraudulently obtaining 
prescription pain killers. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal indictment unsealed this week alleges that Dr. Robert  
Allan Weitzel wrote numerous prescriptions for morphine and Demerol 
to a handful of people but kept the drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, the Drug Enforcement Agency sought to have Weitzel's  
license to prescribe drugs revoked. According to an affidavit by a 
DEA official in that case, Weitzel used illegally obtained drugs 
for himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent indictment charging the drug fraud was handed up by  
the grand jury Sept. 8 but sealed until Tuesday, when the Davis 
County Attorney filed murder charges against Weitzel in the death 
of five elderly patients. 
</P>
<P>
	All five patients died under his care when he was director of a  
geriatric-psychiatric unit run by Houston-based Horizons Mental 
Health Management Inc. at the Davis Hospital and Medical Center in 
Layton. 
</P>
<P>
	Weitzel is accused of killing the patients by prescribing lethal  
doses of morphine and other drugs between Dec. 30, 1995, and Jan. 
14, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Weitzel was arrested Tuesday in Bay City, Texas, about 75 miles  
southwest of Houston. He is free on bail. No date has been set for 
a court appearance in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	The new charges involve 18 prescriptions for morphine and four  
for the pain killer Demerol written to six patients over a span 
from March 4, 1995, to June 3, 1996, overlapping the time he is 
accused of killing his patients. 
</P>
<P>
	A message left at the office of Weitzel's attorney Friday  
evening was not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Weitzel could be sentenced to up to four years in  
prison and fined $250,000 on each count.

<HEADLINE>  London Stages Fashion Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Shrugging off the absence of several of its stars,  
London Fashion Week again proved it deserves its reputation for 
exciting, cutting-edge design. 
</P>
<P>
	From Hussein Chalayan's remote-controlled glass-fiber dress over  
a fluffy pink tutu, to Amanda Wakeley's sleekly classic evening 
sheaths, London has not lost its wow factor -- or its claim to be a 
fashion capital. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, it's been what people love London about: very  
extreme, very bold, very exciting,'' said designer Paul Costelloe, 
who opened proceedings Monday night with a collection of long 
tunics and fluid trousers in the brightest pinks. 
</P>
<P>
	While fashion ``may grow up elsewhere,'' said Daily Telegraph  
fashion editor Hilary Alexander, ``London is where you see fashion 
being born.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 40 designers held catwalk shows over four days and  
more than 200 others exhibited accessories and jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
	The look for spring/summer 2000 is ruched, ruffled and ridged,  
in layers of buttery leather, delicate lace or wisps of chiffon 
printed with florals, spots and stripes or scattered with sequins. 
The palette is white, moss, flesh tones and pastels. Look for 
blouson tops, the tiniest hot pants and daring backless dresses 
with this season's new neckline, the halter. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander McQueen, Vivienne Westwood and Nicole Farhi opted out  
of the London scene after unveiling their collections in New York 
last week. And once again, Antonio Berardi will stage his show in 
Milan. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chalayan, the British Designer of the Year, was there with  
an array of his trademark precision-cut garments. 
</P>
<P>
	In keeping with the season's very feminine look, he showed  
concertina frills and fluted hems on tutus and ballerina dresses. 
Some had cutaway backs with intricately scrolled petticoats that 
resembled rosebuds. 
</P>
<P>
	A child used a remote control device to open the glass-fiber  
panels of one dress, revealing a confection of tulle petticoats. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Smith produced trouser suits and shirts in candy stripes  
that evoked gracious 1920s tennis parties, and embroidered velvets 
inspired by India. Owen Gaster shone with skirts in skin-tight 
snakeskin, tailored pink tweed and leather printed with holograms. 
</P>
<P>
	Red or Dead's Wayne Hemingway sent ``real people'' down the  
catwalk in African prints and outfits in batik, cheesecloth and 
crushed linen, hessian, muslin and leather. He said he decided not 
to use models to give ``a sense of an egalitarian future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Welsh designer Julien Macdonald, known for his glorious knits,  
injected a note of glamour by having Mel G -- Scary Spice to her 
fans -- model a translucent pink beaded dress with slim jeweled 
straps. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Macdonald creations included vivid PVC bomber jackets  
printed with computer graphics, tie-dye jackets and fluorescent 
miniskirts and mirrored halter dresses. 
</P>
<P>
	Another up-and-coming designer, Matthew Williamson, produced  
sequin-studded camisoles and low-slung ``harem'' skirts studded 
with jewels, inspired by India's exotic Kathkali dancers. 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, most shows were held in marquees erected at the main  
venue, the Natural History Museum. But this year many designers 
opted for the battered warehouses that line Brick Lane in east 
London, the historical home of Britain's garment industry. 
</P>
<P>
	They included Preen, which showed dramatically draped leather  
tunics with halter tops and torn hems and Clements Ribeiro, who 
produced dresses, blouson tops, skirts and micro shorts in 
transparent chiffon scattered with flowers or sequins in pink, 
plum, brown and yellow. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonja Nuttall displayed her pleated and ruched outfits in stone,  
black and honey on racks in the back of a parked truck. 
</P>
<P>
	The $28 billion a year British fashion industry now employs  
300,000 people.

<HEADLINE> ABC Show To Have Quick Cable Rerun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If you miss an episode of ``Once and Again,''  
ABC's new drama about divorced parents gingerly starting a new 
romance, you can catch it on cable's Lifetime network just three 
nights later. 
</P>
<P>
	The quick rerun results from a deal between the two networks,  
the most dramatic sign of a looming revolution in TV viewing and 
one likely to force some bruising business battles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once and Again'' aired its premiere Tuesday to strong critical  
acclaim and ratings. The same episode was scheduled for Lifetime 
Friday at 11 p.m. This weekly pattern will continue until the end 
of the series' limited opening run of six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Many in the TV industry predict such ``repurposing'' is the wave  
of the future. With TV networks in the hands of a few large 
corporations, deals to air programs at different times on different 
channels may proliferate. 
</P>
<P>
	Affiliates of the major broadcast networks strongly object to  
the practice, fearing they will lose viewers -- and advertising 
dollars -- if people have more than one choice of when to see a 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once and Again'' is a perfect fit for Lifetime's  
female-dominated audience, said Dawn Tarnofsky-Ostroff, the 
network's executive vice president for entertainment. It's also a 
perfect business fit: the show is produced by Touchstone 
Television, which is owned by the Walt Disney Co., which owns ABC. 
Disney also owns half of Lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet it's so touchy with affiliates that ABC didn't make its own  
announcement of the arrangement Friday and would not make 
executives available to talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
	After tense negotiations, ABC agreed this summer to wait at  
least six months or until after the TV season to ``repurpose'' most 
of its shows. But ABC retained the right to use up to one-quarter 
of its prime-time shows this way. ``Once and Again'' is the first. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC last winter agreed to let the USA Network show episodes of  
NBC's new series, ``Law &AMP; Order: Special Victims Unit,'' two weeks 
after they are first broadcast. It was an arrangement made under 
some duress: NBC agreed to share when the producer threatened to 
stop making ``Law &AMP; Order.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are two schools of thought on how reruns affect original  
episodes of series. Some fear viewers become less interested in 
original shows when they can see other episodes elsewhere, but 
others think they help drum up interest for a program. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, ``Law &AMP; Order'' drew its largest season-opening  
audience this week since its 1990 premiere, a development NBC 
partly credits to frequent reruns of old episodes on the A&AMP;E 
network. 
</P>
<P>
	``The marketing value of having shows being viewed on more than  
one network in more than one time period is really quite surprising 
to people,'' Tarnofsky-Ostroff said. 
</P>
<P>
	After six weeks ``Once and Again'' will be supplanted by ``NYPD  
Blue'' when it returns to its customary Tuesday night time slot. 
The network then may place ``Once and Again'' elsewhere on the 
prime-time schedule -- or the series may go away until January. 
</P>
<P>
	Under no circumstances will Lifetime show original episodes  
before ABC, Tarnofsky-Ostroff said. And she said the network has 
not discussed picking up the series if it's eventually canceled by 
ABC.

<HEADLINE> Flood Victims Return to Ruin, Mud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. (AP) -- Hosing down grime on the tables and  
chairs in his restaurant, which was underwater earlier this week, 
Mickey Bailey vowed to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
	For 75 years, Bob Melton's has been a Rocky Mount institution.  
</P>
<P>
	``They'll figure if Bob Melton's can come back, they all can,''  
said Bailey, the building's owner. 
</P>
<P>
	The barbecue restaurant on the banks of the Tar River was among  
30,000 buildings damaged across eastern North Carolina after 
Hurricane Floyd tore through the state last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew there would be flooding,'' Bailey said. ``We didn't  
know it would be the flood of the millennium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Folks like Bailey returned Thursday to buildings submerged in up  
to 20 inches of rain from Floyd, and found everything a mess: 
filthy, soaked carpeting, bedding and chairs; ruined keepsakes, and 
mud everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Those able to return were the exception, not the rule.  
</P>
<P>
	Across the soggy, 18,000-square-mile region, more than 700 roads  
remained flooded, although sections of Interstate 40 submerged when 
Floyd passed through Sept. 16 were re-opened. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 42 people have been confirmed dead in North Carolina.  
Altogether, the storm killed at least 70 people from the Bahamas to 
New England, with the death toll expected to rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescue workers continued searching by helicopter and boat  
Thursday for those still missing since Floyd hit a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
	They hoped most would turn up safe in shelters or at the homes  
of friends and relatives, but braced themselves for more dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're preparing for many,'' Manning said. ``We just know from  
some of the circumstances ... we may have casualties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of people remained in shelters, though more displaced  
families began moving into a trailer village that opened Wednesday 
outside Rocky Mount. Another temporary housing community is planned 
near Greenville. About 1,000 families are expected to occupy the 
villages, and state officials say other villages may open 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who could return to their homes were unsure about the  
future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if I'm coming back or not,'' said Carson Taylor,  
whose relatives and friends sloshed through his home, carrying out 
mattresses and chairs in a Rocky Mount community of 22 homes about 
100 yards from the Tar. ``Everyone says they're not coming back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Kinston, flooding worsened Thursday and 400 people fled their  
homes as the Neuse River crested at twice its flood stage, while 
the still-rising Lumber River pushed water into the town of Fair 
Bluff. 
</P>
<P>
	National Guard helicopters continued to airlift bottled water  
and supplies to stranded crossroads communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jim Hunt was in Washington on Thursday, lobbying for more  
federal disaster aid. Losses are expected to surpass Hurricane 
Fran's $6 billion in 1996, with farm losses alone accounting for 
more than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have tens of thousands of homes completely lost,'' Hunt  
said. ``We have schools that will be closed for another month or 
two, businesses that are ruined, and the farms of eastern North 
Carolina are devastated. We absolutely cannot recover without a 
great deal of help from our government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd continues to cause problems in other states, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Spots on 15 primary roads and 132 secondary roads in  
southeastern Virginia were still closed Thursday due to high water, 
debris and damage, according to the state Department of 
Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	Juanita Ellis, who lives near Williamsburg, said her road was  
washed out by flooding and now is barricaded. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just to get a loaf of bread you have to go 15 or 20 minutes  
out of your way,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Two German Jets Collide Over N.M. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, N.M. (AP) -- Four German air force pilots parachuted to  
safety after their two jets collided over southeastern New Mexico 
during a training mission. 
</P>
<P>
	The planes were from a German flight training facility at  
Holloman Air Force Base near Alamogordo, about 100 miles northwest 
of the crash site over Sitting Bull Falls. 
</P>
<P>
	Ande Marbach of the Kincaid Ranch said she was hanging out the  
wash when she heard the collision. She called for help when she saw 
parachutes and said the men all appeared to be in good shape. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounded like when they break the sound barrier,'' she said.  
``I saw smoke from where the planes hit and saw two of them come 
down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the pilots used her telephone to call Holloman, Marbach  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holloman said all four men were in stable condition at Carlsbad  
Medical Center. Local authorities said one suffered a back injury, 
two suffered ankle injuries and the fourth initially refused 
medical treatment but later went to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The two Tornado strike-attack planes, which belong to the German  
air force, were on a training mission at mid-level altitudes. Each 
plane carried a student pilot and an instructor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force is investigating the crash.  
</P>
<P>
	The German Luftwaffe has trained its pilots at Holloman for  
years, and its Flying Training Center there currently has about 580 
military personnel and about 25 Tornado airplanes.

<HEADLINE> $125M Mars Orbiter Feared Destroyed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The apparent loss of a NASA spacecraft  
as it started circling Mars will not affect the mission of a 
sibling probe set to land on the red planet in December, mission 
scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
	Mars Climate Orbiter was supposed to be a communications relay  
between Earth and the Mars Polar Lander, but space agency officials 
say no science plans will be scrapped as a result of the orbiter's 
sudden disappearance Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mars Climate Orbiter, which like the lander was on a mission  
to study the planet's weather and look for signs of water, 
apparently flew too close to the Martian atmosphere and broke 
apart, burned up or crashed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The loss of any of those missions is very serious, but it's  
not devastating to the program as a whole,'' said Carl Pilcher of 
NASA'S Office of Space Exploration. ``The missions are designed to 
be complementary and independent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A lot of time will be spent adjusting the lander's programs  
between now and its touchdown Dec. 3, said David Paige, the 
lander's science investigator and a planetary science professor at 
the University of California, Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very substantial change to our plans,'' he said.  
``The orbiter was going to be our primary link to the lander, and 
the way these missions work is that there's an incredible amount of 
advance planning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's not to say it will be impossible to ensure that the  
lander, for instance, does not try to communicate with a 
nonexistent satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is to redesign so that we do everything that we were  
planning to do for the original mission,'' Paige said. 
</P>
<P>
	Human or software error was probably to blame for the loss of  
the orbiter. NASA said mechanical problems were all but ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
	The Climate Orbiter was last heard from about 2:06 a.m. PDT,  
five minutes after its main engine had fired to slow down the 
spacecraft so that it would be captured in the planet's orbit. As 
the probe flew behind Mars, the mission teams expected to lose its 
signal briefly, then regain it at 2:26 a.m., as it came back into 
view. 
</P>
<P>
	But controllers quickly learned that the probe's closest  
approach was about 12 1/2 miles under the lowest survivable altitude. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the spacecraft came in at a lower altitude than we  
predicted,'' said operational project manager Richard Cook. 
``Depending on how low that was, it could be the total loss of the 
mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The orbiter carried instruments designed to study the atmosphere  
and the fate of water that was believed to have once pooled in huge 
oceans on the planet. The information is key to understanding 
whether life ever existed or can exist there. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the instruments was to measure temperatures, dust, water  
vapor and clouds. The craft also had a camera that was to take 
wide- and medium-angle snapshots of the planet's atmosphere, 
similar to an Earth-based weather satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	The Climate Orbiter and Polar Lander collectively made up the  
$327.5 million Mars Surveyor '98 program. The orbiter was valued at 
about $125 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Polar Lander has equipment to study the soil and to look for  
ice beneath the surface. Just before the craft enters the Martian 
atmosphere, it will release two penetrating probes that will punch 
beneath the soil.

<HEADLINE> NASA Abandons Search for Mars Craft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Mission controllers gave up hope Friday of  
ever finding the Mars Climate Orbiter and were trying to determine 
what caused the $125 million NASA spacecraft to disappear. 
</P>
<P>
	Data received from the craft early Thursday indicated it had  
come within about 37 miles of the surface of the red planet and 
probably burned up, broke up or crashed. 
</P>
<P>
	The search for radio signals from Orbiter was abandoned Friday,  
said Mary Hardin, spokeswoman for NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pretty much we know there is no hope of finding anything,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Software problems and human error are likely to blame for  
Orbiter's failure, said project operations manager Richard Cook. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to hit a very small target hundreds of millions  
of kilometers from the Earth,'' he said. ``You're pushing the state 
of the art in doing it, and you have problems sometimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A second NASA spacecraft, the Mars Polar Lander, is set to  
arrive in Mars' orbit Dec. 3. Its mission to explore Mars' climate 
and weather history is not expected to be affected. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin, who met with Orbiter's team  
Friday, said risk is a necessary part of exploring space. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this country, we became great not because we avoided  
failure but looked failure straight in the face and dealt with 
it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Ruth's Farewell Bat Sold at Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Babe Ruth's farewell bat hit a home run at the  
World Series of baseball auctions. 
</P>
<P>
	The bat Ruth leaned on during his farewell appearance at Yankee  
Stadium on June 13, 1948, was sold for $107,000 Thursday night at 
the opening session of a week-long auction of the world's largest 
private college of baseball memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
	The first 130 items were sold for a total of $2,073,763 at  
Sotheby's Auction House, far above the high estimate of $1,334,700. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am thrilled with tonight's sales results -- a perfect game,''  
said Barry Halper, the New Jersey businessman who is selling his 
collection. ``I look forward to the next fifteen sessions with 
anticipation and delight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The entire collection has been valued at between $7 million and  
$11 million, but some experts think the figure should be much 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think that's a bit conservative,'' said David Goodwillie,  
who heads the sports collectibles department at Sotheby's. ``We 
wouldn't be surprised if it reaches $15 million or more. So much of 
it is unique, pieces that have never been sold before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most prized piece at the opening session was a bat Ruth  
never actually used during a game. Ruth, who was dying of cancer, 
borrowed the bat from fellow Hall of Famer Bob Feller to use as a 
cane during the ceremony at Yankee Stadium. Ruth died two months 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	Two sports memorabilia dealers from Chicago, Dave Bushing and  
Don Knoll, bought the bat on behalf of an unidentified client. 
</P>
<P>
	Other notable sales Thursday:  
</P>
<P>
	-- $57,500 for a sheet of 15 autographs from every player who hit  
500 homers except Mark McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	-- $23,000 for an original ticket to the first World Series in  
1903. 
</P>
<P>
	-- $23,000 for Joe DiMaggio's last letter to Marilyn Monroe.  
</P>
<P>
	About 20 percent of Halper's collection was purchased by major  
league baseball for $6 million and is now housed at the Hall of 
Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. The remainder is to be auctioned by 
Sotheby's over the next week. 
</P>
<P>
	More accustomed to handling estate sales of art and furniture,  
the auction house needed two floors of its Manhattan building to 
house the Halper collection. 
</P>
<P>
	The whole operation is watched over by a larger-than-life wax  
figure of Babe Ruth, listed from $3,500 to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a framed display of canceled paychecks for the 1920  
Cincinnati Reds. Their most expensive player was Hall of Famer Edd 
Roush, who was getting a fancy $425 every two weeks. He batted 
.339, third in the National League, that season. 
</P>
<P>
	One customer, awed by the number of items on display, said of  
Halper, ``He must have a very understanding wife.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He'd have to just to accommodate the uniform jerseys that cover  
three walls at Sotheby's and rode on a dry cleaning rack in the 
basement of his home. 
</P>
<P>
	The jerseys include one from home run king Hank Aaron that's  
inscribed, ``I hit a few in this,'' and another identified as among 
those Pete Rose wore the night he broke Ty Cobb's hit record. If 
you prefer something straight from Cobb, his dentures are 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	In another corner are first baseman Bill Buckner's glove and  
cleats from the sixth game of the 1986 World Series. Buckner's 
10th-inning error enabled the New York Mets to beat Boston and the 
Mets went on to win the Series in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	The glove is accompanied by a card from Buckner to Halper which  
contains a misspelling. It says: ``To my pal, Barry. This glove has 
way to many holes in it. This is the glove I wore when I missed 
Mookie Wilson's ground ball in the sixth game. What a nightmare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also in the collection is Moe Berg's spy camera, which dates to  
a 1934 barnstorming trip through Japan when the mysterious catcher 
was taking reconnaissance pictures for the U.S. government that 
proved helpful when World War II began. 
</P>
<P>
	The most expensive item for sale is a collection of 16 World  
Series rings from former New York Yankees owner Del Webb, a 
co-owner of the team during its dynasty years of 1947-64. They are 
listed from $100,000 to $200,000 in the two-volume Sotheby's 
catalog, which costs $80. 
</P>
<P>
	About 2,500 lots will be up for sale during the auction, which  
continues through Sept. 29. Another 5,500 pieces, most of them 
priced under $1,000, will go on sale at Sotheby's Internet site, 
which will be launched in November. There is a 15 percent buyer's 
premium for items up to $50,000 and 10 percent after that. 
</P>
<P>
	Halper, a minority owner of the Yankees, began his collection  
simply with player autographs. It just grew from there. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodwillie, who spent two years after college playing Class A  
baseball at Newark, Ohio, said, ``Barry never asked me for my 
autograph.''

it is unique, pieces that have never been sold before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most prized piece at the opening session was a bat Ruth  
never actually used during a game. Ruth, who was dying of cancer, 
borrowed the bat from fellow Hall of Famer Bob Feller to use as a 
cane during the ceremony at Yankee Stadium. Ruth died two months 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	Two sports memorabilia dealers from Chicago, Dave Bushing and  
Don Knoll, bought the bat on behalf of an unidentified client. 
</P>
<P>
	Other notable sales Thursday:  
</P>
<P>
	-- $57,500 for a sheet of 15 autographs from every player who hit  
500 homers except Mark McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	-- $23,000 for an original ticket to the first World Series in  
1903. 
</P>
<P>
	-- $23,000 for Joe DiMaggio's last letter to Marilyn Monroe.  
</P>
<P>
	About 20 percent of Halper's collection was purchased by major  
league baseball for $6 million and is now housed at the Hall of 
Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. The remainder is to be auctioned by 
Sotheby's over the next week. 
</P>
<P>
	More accustomed to handling estate sales of art and furniture,  
the auction house needed two floors of its Manhattan building to 
house the Halper collection. 
</P>
<P>
	The whole operation is watched over by a larger-than-life wax  
figure of Babe Ruth, listed from $3,500 to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a framed display of canceled paychecks for the 1920  
Cincinnati Reds. Their most expensive player was Hall of Famer Edd 
Roush, who was getting a fancy $425 every two weeks. He batted 
.339, third in the National League, that season. 
</P>
<P>
	One customer, awed by the number of items on display, said of  
Halper, ``He must have a very understanding wife.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He'd have to just to accommodate the uniform jerseys that cover  
three walls at Sotheby's and rode on a dry cleaning rack in the 
basement of his home. 
</P>
<P>
	The jerseys include one from home run king Hank Aaron that's  
inscribed, ``I hit a few in this,'' and another identified as among 
those Pete Rose wore the night he broke Ty Cobb's hit record. If 
you prefer something straight from Cobb, his dentures are 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	In another corner are first baseman Bill Buckner's glove and  
cleats from the sixth game of the 1986 World Series. Buckner's 
10th-inning error enabled the New York Mets to beat Boston and the 
Mets went on to win the Series in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	The glove is accompanied by a card from Buckner to Halper which  
contains a misspelling. It says: ``To my pal, Barry. This glove has 
way to many holes in it. This is the glove I wore when I missed 
Mookie Wilson's ground ball in the sixth game. What a nightmare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also in the collection is Moe Berg's spy camera, which dates to  
a 1934 barnstorming trip through Japan when the mysterious catcher 
was taking reconnaissance pictures for the U.S. government that 
proved helpful when World War II began. 
</P>
<P>
	The most expensive item for sale is a collection of 16 World  
Series rings from former New York Yankees owner Del Webb, a 
co-owner of the team during its dynasty years of 1947-64. They are 
listed from $100,000 to $200,000 in the two-volume Sotheby's 
catalog, which costs $80. 
</P>
<P>
	About 2,500 lots will be up for sale during the auction, which  
continues through Sept. 29. Another 5,500 pieces, most of them 
priced under $1,000, will go on sale at Sotheby's Internet site, 
which will be launched in November. There is a 15 percent buyer's 
premium for items up to $50,000 and 10 percent after that. 
</P>
<P>
	Halper, a minority owner of the Yankees, began his collection  
simply with player autographs. It just grew from there. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodwillie, who spent two years after college playing Class A  
baseball at Newark, Ohio, said, ``Barry never asked me for my 
autograph.''

<HEADLINE> Red Sox Release Veteran Pitcher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Mark Portugal, recently removed from the Boston  
Red Sox starting rotation, was released Friday night with just nine 
games left and a playoff berth likely. 
</P>
<P>
	``We released Mark Portugal. We felt it was the best thing for  
the organization,'' Red Sox manager Jimy Williams said after a 1-0 
loss to the Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	He refused to elaborate and Portugal didn't comment.  
</P>
<P>
	But several of Portugal's ex-teammates appeared upset that a  
pitcher who had started 27 of his 31 games and was second on the 
team with 150 1-3 innings would be released so late in the season 
with Boston holding a comfortable lead over Oakland in the 
wild-card race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a shame,'' designated hitter Reggie Jefferson  
said. ``You hate to see a guy stay here all year and then get 
released with (nine) games to go. It doesn't make any sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't understand why now, but I don't know. I couldn't tell  
you,'' Nomar Garciaparra said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I should really comment on that right now,''  
said Bret Saberhagen, who pitched seven strong innings in Friday 
night's loss. ``It just hit me. That's something that we'll have to 
deal with. It's an inside thing. I'm kind of surprised.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Portugal was 7-12 with a 5.51 ERA and allowed 28 homers. He had  
lost four consecutive decisions since his last victory on Aug. 4 
against Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	He made his last start Sept. 11 in an 11-10 win in New York over  
the Yankees. He allowed four runs and seven hits in four innings. 
Since then, he had been used only twice, pitching three innings in 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox signed Portugal, 36, as a free agent after he went  
10-5 last year with Philadelphia. He had been signed through 1999 
with an option for 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the season, Portugal left the team briefly and  
considered retirement to spend more time with his children.

<HEADLINE> Wolverines Must Slow Dayne </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- The Michigan Wolverines held Syracuse to 59  
rushing yards last week. If they can do the same to Wisconsin's Ron 
Dayne, they'll shift the balance of power in the Big Ten and the 
Heisman Trophy race. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 4 Michigan visits Camp Randall Stadium on Saturday. The  
Wolverines will try to repeat last year's performance against the 
20th-ranked Badgers' dominating tailback, who managed only 53 yards 
in Wisconsin's only loss of the year. Wisconsin went on to win the 
Big Ten title. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody knows he's a load, he's a big guy, he's powerful,''  
said Michigan linebacker James Hall. ``Up front we're going to try 
to get him before he gets started, try to get him behind the line 
of scrimmage. Once he gets in the secondary, that's when he does 
his thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Dayne is serious about winning the Heisman, this game would  
be a good time to start proving it. A loss to Michigan or Ohio 
State next week will kill the Badgers' already slim chances of 
contending for the national title, the main reason Dayne came back 
to Wisconsin for his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been solid but unspectacular after three games, during  
which he moved into sixth place on the NCAA's career rushing list. 
But last week he was unable to prevent the Badgers from suffering 
an embarrassing loss to Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne has been good, but he'll have to be great at some point in  
order to win the big trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking at it as a big game for me and for the team,''  
Dayne said. ``After losing last week, we have something to make up 
for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The stage is set for Dayne to have a breakout game. With no  
other marquee matchups on the college football schedule this week, 
the eyes of Heisman voters will be focused on Madison. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne plays at about 252 pounds. That makes him heavier than  
seven starters on Michigan's defense, but the Wolverines (3-0) say 
they can stop him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I admit, once he gets going, it's a struggle to bring him  
down,'' senior linebacker Ian Gold said. ``But the bigger they are, 
the harder they fall. We'll go for his legs. It's that simple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their undefeated record and lofty ranking, the  
Wolverines are dealing with the puzzling disappearance of their 
offense, particularly their running game. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan averaged just 155.4 rushing yards per game last season,  
the school's lowest average since 1963. The Wolverines have just 
377 rushing yards this year, including a dismal 121 on 36 attempts 
against Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course the Badgers let Michigan accumulate a season-high 257  
yards on the ground during the Wolverines' 27-10 win over Wisconsin 
in Ann Arbor last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Tailback Anthony Thomas rushed for 102 yards against the Badgers  
last year and 97 last week against Syracuse but no solid second 
option has emerged in the Michigan backfield. 
</P>
<P>
	That lack of depth could be a problem against the Badgers, whose  
rapidly improving defense would love to make its reputation against 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to stop the run,'' said Wisconsin defensive  
coordinator Kevin Cosgrove. ``That's one of the things we didn't do 
against them last year. We did a poor job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week's 17-12 loss at Cincinnati was the only reminder the  
Badgers (2-1) should ever need that Dayne cannot carry the team to 
victory alone. Dayne racked up 231 yards but he also fumbled in the 
Bearcats' end zone, his first turnover in 336 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne missed several series while nursing a first-quarter  
sprained ankle, but he said the injury won't limit him against 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ron's been scrutinized more than any athlete, particularly  
here,'' said Wisconsin offensive coordinator Brian White. ``Every 
game's a litmus test for the Heisman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One Badger will be severely constrained by injury, however.  
Coach Barry Alvarez may watch the game from the press box because 
of his damaged right knee, which will be replaced after the Ohio 
State game. 
</P>
<P>
	Wide receiver Chris Chambers is expected to play for Wisconsin  
after missing two games with a broken bone in his hand. Some 
Badgers say their terrible outing last week will jump-start the 
team into conference play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was a good thing, because it woke us up,'' kick  
returner and wide receiver Nick Davis said. ``The beast is alive. 
The sleeping giant is alive.''

<HEADLINE> Rural School Opposes Bush Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOODRICH, Texas (AP) -- Some folks in this rural crossroads find  
it hard to understand presidential candidate George W. Bush's 
education proposal that would strip an impoverished public school 
of funds. Supporters counter that it's an effective way to improve 
poorly performing schools. 
</P>
<P>
	For Goodrich superintendent James B. Boyce, one thing is clear:  
His district has become ``a political lightning rod'' on issues 
ranging from standardized testing to school vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month Bush, the Texas governor who is seeking the  
Republican presidential nomination, pledged to change federal 
policies that ``cheat poor children.'' The cornerstone of his 
platform takes federal Title 1 funds from the worst-scoring 
schools, transferring the approximately $1,500 per pupil to poor 
parents for use toward educational alternatives, such as private 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	States would be required to test students in grades 3 through 8  
annually, and schools that fell below performance standards for 
three consecutive years would lose Title 1 funds, which amount to 
more than $8 billion annually nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``Federal money will no longer flow to failure,'' Bush vowed.  
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, only one of 1,100 districts would lose money under  
this reform: Goodrich. And that has some in this poor town of 300 
people 60 miles northeast of Houston rethinking their support for 
the popular governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always been proud of what the Bush family has done for  
Texas, but this is not fair,'' said Mark Ryman, the town's mayor 
who is also a substitute teacher. ``We do everything in this town 
for this school, and yet the governor, who I would vote for as 
president, says we have to lose our money? 
</P>
<P>
	``Then I will do everything I can to stop him from being  
president, because I don't think he's in touch with reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goodrich Elementary, attended by 150 children in kindergarten  
through fifth grade, was built in 1936 by the Works Progress 
Administration. The red-brick schoolhouse has long operated with 
the aid of the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	But for three years running, the Texas Education Agency has  
ranked the school as ``low-performing,'' based on student scores on 
the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills. Last year, 44.2 percent of 
52 poor students taking the math portion of the TAAS test passed. 
Schools with less than a 45 percent passing rate are considered low 
performing. 
</P>
<P>
	If Bush's plan were law, Goodrich Elementary would stand to lose  
some of its $47,000 in annual Title 1 funding. 
</P>
<P>
	That prospect and the town's newfound notoriety bother the  
mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryman, a disabled retiree with a straw cowboy hat and a long  
white mustache, received the state's Heroes for Children award for 
volunteer school work four years ago. He says poverty is 
education's worst enemy in Goodrich, where many families earn less 
than $15,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are kids I know who have come to school in their pajamas  
because that's the only thing they have to wear,'' he said. ``We do 
the best we can with the funds we have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boyce, the district's fourth superintendent since 1997, works in  
an aging, two-story frame house the district converted into an 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	To explain the school's performance, he rattles off a list of  
challenges in addition to poverty: a transient population, higher 
than average turnover in administration and high levels of adult 
illiteracy. 
</P>
<P>
	But Boyce's chief complaint -- the crux of the district's appeal  
of its rankings -- is directed at state education officials in 
Austin. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the test, it's the percentage way it's calculated,''  
Boyce said. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodrich's ranking would have improved if the scoring formula  
had not been changed to include the scores of learning-disabled 
students, Boyce said. None of the 10 special education students in 
the district who took the TAAS last school year passed it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas Education Agency rejects this notion. ``I don't think  
that was a cause for anyone going from acceptable to 
low-performing,'' said agency spokesman Joey Lozano. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Boyce has aggressively pursued federal and state  
grants to address his district's shortcomings. A new computer lab 
and parents' resource center are evidence of his success. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next three years, Goodrich schools will collect about  
$850,000 in grants. Ironically, the elementary school's low ranking 
helped capture much of this money. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a Catch-22,'' says Alison Breteler, president of the  
Goodrich Parent Teacher Association. ``You can't say, 'Because of 
the ranking we're going to give you an increase,' then say, 
'Because of the low ranking we're going to take money away from 
you.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush campaign spokesman Scott McClellan says the candidate  
intends to address this disparity in proposals that have yet to be 
unveiled. Other states are following Texas' lead on school 
accountability, he says. ``Without tests, there is no pressure to 
improve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Testing aside, the voucher provisions of Bush's plan would hurt  
minority schoolchildren, such as those who make up nearly half of 
Goodrich's enrollment, says Rick Dovalina, national president of 
the League of United Latin American Citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	``The governor was very much in support of voucher legislation  
that eventually failed in Texas,'' Dovalina said. ``We feel, as 
president, he's going to continue that mentality of finding ways to 
divert funds from public education, which will hurt the minority 
community and the poor community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goodrich, which has only one restaurant and one industry -- a  
company that refurbishes box cars -- is unlikely ever to support a 
private school. Although there are Christian schools in Livingston, 
five miles to the north, most have entrance exams or waiting lists 
and costs that exceed the $1,500 per year Bush's proposal offers. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't dampen the enthusiasm of the governor's supporters.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are all responsible for helping those kids in Goodrich get  
help,'' said Greg Talley, executive director of Putting Children 
First, an Austin-based pro-voucher group. ``I think Bush is right 
on target when he says school choice is about holding schools 
accountable. If you don't do a good job in three years, we're going 
to do something about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For most Goodrich students, Boyce said, educational alternatives  
are unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is their home, and they're going to be with us until they  
graduate,'' he said. ``We're concerned about these kids and their 
future.''

<HEADLINE> Court Nixes Late-Term Abortion Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A federal appeals court ruled Friday that bans  
on a type of late-term abortion in three Midwestern states were 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	A panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled  
separately on cases from Nebraska, Arkansas and Iowa, issuing all 
three rulings the same day because the cases were so similar. The 
cases involve the procedure that opponents call ``partial-birth 
abortion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three states are among 28 that have adopted bans of the  
procedure since 1995, although the courts have blocked or limited 
enforcement in 19 of those states. In 1997, President Clinton 
vetoed a national late-term abortion ban. The House voted to 
override, but the Senate sustained the veto. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Midwestern cases, the court cited concerns about the  
vagueness of the laws -- measures that the judges believed could be 
read to prohibit common abortion procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	``The central difficulty with the Arkansas statute is that it  
covers too much,'' Chief Judge Richard Arnold wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Nebraska case, Arnold wrote that the law ``would prohibit  
in many circumstances the most common method of second-trimester 
abortion. Such a prohibition places an undue burden on the right of 
women to choose whether to have an abortion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The court's ruling confirms that the entire campaign to ban  
'partial-birth abortion' -- a campaign that has consumed Congress 
and the federal courts for over three years -- is nothing but a 
fraud designed to rob American women of their right to abortion,'' 
said Janet Benshoof, president of Center for Reproductive Law and 
Policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska Attorney General Don Stenberg said he would appeal, and  
Janet Parshall, spokeswoman for the Family Research Council, said: 
``U.S. Supreme Court -- here we come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The abortion procedure involves partially extracting a fetus,  
legs first, through the birth canal, cutting the skull and draining 
the contents.

<HEADLINE> Judge Awards Injured Boxer Damages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Michael Watson, who is brain injured from a world  
title bout eight years ago, is entitled to damages from the British 
Boxing Board of Control because he did not receive ``proper 
attention,'' a High Court judge ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Ian Kennedy, dealing only with the issue of liability,  
held that Watson would have made a good recovery if proper medical 
procedures had been followed. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson, who is reported to have lost half of his brain function  
and is paralyzed on his left side, is believed to be seeking about 
$1.6 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
	A date for damage-award portion of the trial was not announced.  
The Board of Control said it would seek permission to appeal the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson did not comment after the ruling but in a statement read  
by his solicitor, he said: ``I am delighted that I have won my case 
and that I will now be compensated for my injuries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I am pleased that as a result of what has happened to me, new  
rules have been introduced which have made boxing, the sport I 
love, safer,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take comfort from the fact that those changes may have  
already saved others from a similar fate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watson fought Chris Eubank for the World Boxing Organization  
super-middleweight title in September 1991. Watson was ahead on 
points when he knocked Eubank down in the 11th round. 
</P>
<P>
	But Eubank got up to knock Watson down and the fight was halted  
26 seconds into the 12th with Watson unable to defend himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The British Board of Boxing Control argued that even if Watson  
had been given the treatment he says he should have received, he 
would have suffered the same level of brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the board said it had ``complete sympathy'' for  
Watson but didn't believe it had a legal liability.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors Head Off Financial Guru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A financial guru accused of defrauding Japanese  
investors of about $1 billion, may have tried to thwart federal 
prosecutors' fraud probe by attempting to liquidate his New Jersey 
company in a West Indies island court. 
</P>
<P>
	Princeton Economics International Ltd., the firm run by Martin  
A. Armstrong that is at the heart of the investment turmoil, filed 
for bankruptcy last Friday in the Turks and Caicos Islands, where 
it is incorporated. 
</P>
<P>
	The filing surprised U.S. prosecutors, who had frozen all of  
Armstrong's bank accounts four days earlier. The prosecutors were 
forced to scramble last weekend to get a court order to prevent 
Armstrong from liquidating the company or any of its subsidiaries 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Cohen, the U.S. court receiver for Armstrong's companies,  
requested the restraining order to stop Armstrong from taking 
actions ``that may adversely impact this court's jurisdiction and 
ability to manage this case.'' Authorities are still trying to 
figure out what happened to the Japanese investments, and how much 
money is left to repay them. That would be hard to do if Armstrong 
started selling off assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, an oft-quoted investment advisor renown for  
forecasting market swings, was arrested Sept. 13 on allegations of 
securities fraud. He was released on $5 million bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Complaints against Armstrong were filed by the U.S. Attorney,  
and two regulators, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and 
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Unger, an attorney for Armstrong, said Princeton  
Economics filed for bankruptcy ``because of all the problems that 
are out there.'' He said the interim liquidator appointed by the 
Turks and Caicos court ``is going to be able to deal with issues 
that may arise wherever they arise in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why Armstrong did not forewarn U.S. prosecutors, Unger  
said only that, ``It was a company decision. They went to court and 
they did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. prosecutors and regulators believe Armstrong raised more  
than $3 billion from Japanese investors, promising to repay them 
with interest. 
</P>
<P>
	He invested the Japanese funds in currencies, options andother  
securities, but lost more than $500 million between 1997 and August 
1999 and tried to hide the losses, prosecutors have claimed in 
court documents. 
</P>
<P>
	The money was held in accounts in the securities unit of  
Republic Bank of New York. Prosecutors allege that the bank 
provided letters to Armstrong, at his request, which overstated the 
balances in the accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he repaid the investors much of their money, today  
there is only $43 million left in the Republic accounts to repay 
almost $1 billion in securities still held by the Japanese 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, through a lawyer, has denied any fraud or criminal  
conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's never been any dispute some money was lost, the  
question is whether it was honest or criminal,'' said Marc Durant, 
who is representing Armstrong in his criminal case. Armstrong's 
company has accused Republic of mismanaging its accounts. Princeton 
Economics International, is based in Princeton, N.J., but has no 
connection to the nearby Ivy League university. It has lost a lot 
of business since Armstrong's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Until last week, Armstrong was the investment advisor on three  
investment funds, all unrelated to the problems with the Japanese 
securities, and all earning solid returns. 
</P>
<P>
	Two are now closing and the third is looking for a new advisor.  
</P>
<P>
	``How can he possibly manage the fund with this on his head?''  
asks Dion Friedland, chairman of the Magnum Group of Funds, which 
sponsored the $14 million Princeton Global Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Friedland said he opted to close the fund, although he said  
Armstrong was an ``incredible'' investor and the fund posted a 
whopping 60 percent return in the last 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other Japanese-based funds Armstrong ran were also closed,  
though it is unclear when and why they did so. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, who turned a boyhood love of coins into a lucrative  
silver and commodities business, spent almost 30 years building 
Princeton Economics International and its subsidiaries into a 
global research group with 300 employees and offices on five 
continents. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, within days of his arrest, Armstrong's empire started to  
contract. The office in Japan, a subsidiary called Cresvale 
International Ltd., will shut its doors at the end of the month and 
lay off its 50 employees.

	ALBUQUERQUE (AP) -- Drew Cloud, a longtime New Mexico Democratic  
Party leader, died Wednesday after a long bout with cancer. He was 
75. 
</P>
<P>
	A former union representative and state legislator, Cloud went

<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Dr. William Eckert, a forensic pathologist  
who was a consultant on major cases including the assassination of 
Robert F. Kennedy and the Jonestown massacre, died Sept. 17. He was 
73. 
</P>
<P>
	Eckert founded the International Organization of Forensic  
Medicine and the American Journal of Forensic Medicine and 
Pathology. 
</P>
<P>
	He was president of the International Association of Forensic  
Sciences and the National Association of Medical Examiners, wrote 
several books and held academic appointments at a number of 
universities, including Tulane Medical School. 
</P>
<P>
	Eckert was consulted on such famous cases as the Charles Manson

Nazi doctor Joseph Mengele's body and the terrorist bombing of Pan 
Am Flight 103. 
</P>
<P>
	In the late 1980s, Eckert put together an investigative team  
that re-examined the 100-year-old Jack the Ripper prostitute 
murders. He also served as a consultant for the television series 
``Quincy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Upon hearing that Robert Kennedy had been assassinated in his

	SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- Ivan Goff, co-creator of the TV  
series ``Charlie's Angels'' and co-writer of the films ``White 
Heat,'' ``Captain Horatio Hornblower'' and ``Man of a Thousand 
Faces,'' died Thursday. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	With his writing partner for 39 years, the late Ben Roberts,  
Goff wrote 25 feature films that starred James Cagney, Gregory 
Peck, Clark Gable, Doris Day, Joan Crawford and others. Among their 
credits: ``Midnight Lace,'' ``Shake Hands with the Devil,'' ``Band 
of Angels,'' ``Green Fire,'' ``King of the Khyber Rifles,'' ``Come 
Fill the Cup'' and ``Goodbye, My Fancy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goff and Roberts were Oscar-nominated for their screenplay of  
``Man of a Thousand Faces,'' which starred Cagney as Lon Chaney. In 
1954-55, Goff served as president of the screen writers council of 
the Screen Writers Guild, predecessor of the Writers Guild of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1960s, the pair turned to television, writing ``The  
Rogues'' for Dick Powell, David Niven and Charles Boyer. They also 
produced ``Mannix'' (1967-75) and created ``Charlie's Angels'' 
(1976-81). 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Perth, Goff worked as a newspaperman in Australia,  
freelanced in London in the early 1930s and became Hollywood 
correspondent for the London Daily Mirror in 1936. He wrote a 
novel, ``No Longer Innocent,'' and a play ``Portrait in Black'' 
before turning to films. He met Roberts while both served in the 
U.S. Army Signal Corps during World War II.

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Stanley Fleishman, who championed the rights  
of disabled people and won a ruling in which the state Supreme 
Court found that Henry Miller's book ``Tropic of Cancer'' was not 
obscene, died Thursday of pneumonia and complications from surgery. 
He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleishman, who was disabled by polio when he was 1, was a  
familiar site in court with his crutches when he stood to argue his 
cases on such divergent subjects as public access rights for the 
disabled and free-speech rights for the makers of adult films. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing deteriorating health, he used a wheelchair for the first  
time two months ago when he took his last case before the 9th U.S. 
Circuit Court of Appeals, said Barry Fisher, his partner in the 
Fleishman &AMP; Fisher public interest law firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The more controversial free-speech cases he took on included  
Miller's once-banned book ``Tropic of Cancer;'' the adult movie 
``Deep Throat;'' and the rights of the Pussycat adult theater 
chain. 
</P>
<P>
	It was during his work on behalf of ``Deep Throat,'' that he  
observed people in wheelchairs were being excluded from juries for 
not being ``in possession of their faculties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He argued successfully to have them included in juries, along  
with blind and deaf people, and followed that up with lawsuits 
seeking access for the disabled to jobs, airlines, public 
buildings, restaurants and hotels. 
</P>
<P>
	His work brought him honors from everyone from Playboy  
Magazine's Hugh Hefner to advocates for the disabled.

<HEADLINE> Bush to Buchanan: Stay With GOP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush spoke with typical confidence  
about his future -- ``I think I'm going to be president'' -- but 
offered few details of what his presidency would provide. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-term Texas governor said he is ``filling in the blanks  
on policy'' on his own timetable. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he addressed a wide range of topics, Bush seemed  
unusually guarded and brusque about policy questions during an 
interview Friday with The Associated Press. In a roundtable with AP 
editors and reporters, he repeatedly brushed off follow-up 
questions that sought to pin him down. 
</P>
<P>
	He did urge commentator Pat Buchanan not to bolt the Republican  
Party. A three-time Republican presidential candidate, Buchanan has 
hinted he will drop out of the GOP race to seek the Reform Party 
nomination. Republicans fear that could siphon votes from their 
nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want Pat Buchanan to leave the party,'' Bush said,  
recalling his father's defeat by President Clinton in a three-way 
race in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's important, should I be the nominee, to unite the  
Republican Party. I'm going to need every vote I can get among 
Republicans to win the election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush acknowledged that Reform Party founder Ross Perot's general  
election campaign affected the 1992 race, which ended his father's 
presidency. Perot drew 19 percent, George Bush 37 percent and 
Clinton 43 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Bush, however, refused to speculate about Buchanan's  
impact in 2000, saying, ``It's too early to judge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican and conservative leaders, including at least three  
fellow presidential candidates, have issued harsh judgments of 
Buchanan's campaign book, ``A Republic, Not an Empire.'' In it, 
Buchanan questions the timing of the United States' entry into 
World War II and its participation in the battle against Adolf 
Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
	While not joining in the condemnation of Buchanan, Bush said he  
disagreed with Buchanan's opinion that Germany was not a threat to 
the United States after 1940. ``Germany (was) a threat,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the interview, Bush also said:  
</P>
<P>
	--He supports raising the federal minimum wage by $1 an hour, but  
only if states can opt out, a condition that could gut any proposed 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	--China is among the potential threats that require a strong U.S.  
military. Calling U.S.-China ties ``a competitive relationship,'' 
Bush said, ``I see nothing on the horizon, no talks about war right 
now, but it is a major issue'' for the next president. 
</P>
<P>
	--Congress should stick to spending limits set in the 1997  
balanced-budget deal. GOP leaders say they will exceed the limits, 
and the Congressional Budget Office says lawmakers are already on 
course to spend part of the Social Security surplus. One day after 
Clinton vetoed the GOP tax-cutting bill, Bush said he won't offer 
his own tax-reduction package until ``after the dust has cleared 
here in Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--The census should be ``an actual count,'' not conducted with  
statistical sampling methods. Minority groups being courted by Bush 
argue that traditional head counts underestimate their numbers, 
which dilutes their political clout. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's minimum wage proposal, though not fully formed, would  
give states unconditional ability to bypass a federally set wage 
increase. States would not be able to opt out of minimum wage 
levels already in place. 
</P>
<P>
	``My worry about the minimum wage is that if it's applied  
universally it's going to price certain people out of the job 
market,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said he had not spoken to GOP leaders in the Senate or  
House about taxes or any other issues pending in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Discussing a range of foreign policy issues, Bush said he had  
the will to force United Nations weapons inspectors back into Iraq. 
He sided with supporters of the troubled F-22 stealth fighter, 
although some GOP lawmakers are trying to cut the $65 billion 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's confident air resurfaced Friday night during an  
appearance at the Hispanic Heritage Leadership Awards banquet. To a 
crowd that included several Republican lawmakers, he said: ``Take a 
deep breath. Help is on the way.''

<HEADLINE> Corzine Announces N.J. Senate Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUMMIT, N.J. (AP) -- A former Wall Street investment banker with  
a multi-million dollar bank account has launched his first 
political campaign, aiming to take the seat of retiring Sen. Frank 
Lautenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Jon Corzine announced his intention to seek the Democratic  
nomination for the New Jersey Senate seat on Thursday, noting that 
the Democrat incumbent also was a successful businessman before 
running for Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Corzine said while his potential opponents are already known by  
the public because of their long time in political office, he will 
need air time ``to introduce myself the New Jersey public, telling 
them who I am, why I'm running, what I'm about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For many Democrats, Corzine's appeal rests in his personal  
wealth -- estimated at $300 million -- and his outsider status. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Gov. Christie Whitman surprised many when she dropped  
out of contention for the GOP nomination this month. Some GOP 
officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Whitman was 
disturbed by the prospect of having to raise large amounts of money 
to compete against Corzine. Whitman has denied that. 
</P>
<P>
	One Democrat, U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone, pulled the plug on his  
own campaign because the prospect of Corzine's big-bucks candidacy 
chilled fund-raising opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Democrats exploring a run, former Gov. Jim Florio and former  
state Democratic chairman Thomas Byrne, are calling for limits in 
campaign spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Corzine on Thursday rejected the notion that he was trying to  
buy the election. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a concept that makes no sense,'' Corzine said. ``People  
are interested in ideas and issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to universal health care and gun control, Corzine  
also favors tax-free savings for college tuition and free state 
college tuition for good students.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up a Bit Against the Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar on Friday rose modestly against the  
Japanese yen for a second straight session amid renewed fears about 
Japan's economic recovery and in advance of a weekend meeting of 
international finance ministers. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 104.17  
Japanese yen, up from 103.95 late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders sold the yen Friday after Japan's Nikkei 225-stock  
benchmark index dropped 2.6 percent following heightened worries 
about whether Japan could keep alive its recovery from a steep 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Some traders also were anxious in advance of a Washington  
meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized nations. There has 
been speculation that Japan and other G-7 nations may try to 
coordinate action to weaken the surging yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan has intervened in its currency markets several times this  
summer in an attempt to slow the yen's gains, but without success. 
As recently as May, the dollar bought more than 124 yen, but the 
dollar since has fallen 16 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese officials believe that the yen has strengthened too  
much and could derail the economic recovery. A rising yen makes it 
harder for Japanese exports to compete on world markets. 
</P>
<P>
	But traders doubt the United States would be willing to support  
a new currency policy. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading, the euro rose to $1.0464 from $1.0440 late  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5310 Swiss francs, down from  
1.5362, and 1.4734 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4711. The British 
pound rose to $1.6437 from $1.6407. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Friday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8685 German 
marks, down from 1.8734; 6.2666 French francs, down from 6.2831; 
and 1,849.79 Italian lire, down from 1,854.66.

	``It is not a favor we ask for Israel,'' the foreign minister  
told the Center for Middle East Peace and Cooperation, a private 
group that tries to promote compromise and business in the Middle 
East. ``A true peace will benefit everyone in the area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Levy urged Egypt, with which Israel signed a peace treaty 20  
years ago, to consent to a ``warmer peace'' with the Jewish state -- 
relations are strictly formal with little in the way of exchanges 
between the two sides despite Israeli overtures. 
</P>
<P>
	The foreign minister, who has served in various Israeli  
governments along a broad political spectrum, gave no indication on 
what issues Israel would take a tough line. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said ``in order to achieve peace we must insist on  
aspects that are indispensable for us. Sometimes people don't 
understand we have principles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In negotiations with the Palestinians, Israel faces demands that  
it give up virtually the entire West Bank, agree to establishment 
of a Palestinian state, consent to having its capital in Jerusalem 
and take in tens of thousands of Arab refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	In negotiations not yet opened with Syria, Israel faces demands  
that it give up the strategic Golan Heights border enclave as well 
as land up to the shores of the Sea of Galilee, which holds 
Israel's precious water reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Israel is ready to take risks,'' Levy said. ``There will be  
obstacles, but we must not let that discourage us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elaborating on Levy's remarks, Zalman Shoval, the Israeli  
ambassador to the United States, said that with the peace process 
advancing, Israel could not accept continued use of the United 
Nations and other international forums to promote an anti-Israel 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the only case in which a country that has been the  
victim of aggression has been in the dock, as an accused, at the 
U.N.,'' Shoval said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The ambassador said Israel should not remain excluded from  
taking its turn on the Security Council, and that the United States 
was trying to help. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said, meanwhile, that the  
United States ``would stand with those who take risks for peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But she added that ``only the parties, not their friends, can  
make the tough decisions themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, on the other hand, said  
the U.S. role in peacemaking is crucial -- and has been since 
U.S.-hosted talks at Camp David in 1978 produced a peace treaty 
between Egypt and Israel the next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Underscoring the Arabs' approach, which the Clinton  
administration endorses, Moussa reminded Israel that ``the name of 
the game is land for peace.''

<HEADLINE> US Retailer's Advertisements Banned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- In Germany, some guarantees are just  
too good to be true. 
</P>
<P>
	Threatened by the American catalogue company Lands' End  
money-back guarantee, no matter what, retail competitors took the 
company to Germany's highest court -- and won a ban on 
advertisements publicizing the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Lands' End is responding with a set of ads in German  
newspapers and magazines poking fun at the ban. There's a picture 
of a fly with the caption: 1-Day Guarantee. A washing machine, 
guaranteed 6 months. 
</P>
<P>
	And next to the Lands' End logo: ``Advertisement forbidden in  
Germany.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgeville, Wis.-based company expanded overseas to England  
in 1993, Japan in 1994 and Germany in 1996, exporting along with 
its classic chinos and wool cardigans the guarantee that it will 
take back any of its products, any time, no questions asked, cash 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	Within a year of launching the German business, the company was  
being sued by an agency that monitors advertising claiming unfair 
advertisement. The case went all the way to the Supreme Court in 
Karlsruhe, which banned the advertisements last month ruling the 
guarantee was ``economically unfeasible'' and therefore amounted to 
unfair competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The guarantee was not an issue either in Japan or England.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult to understand from an American perspective. All  
we're trying to do is to offer the same service level in Germany 
that we offer everywhere else in the world,'' said Steve Bechwar, 
manager of Lands' Ends operations in Mettlach, Germany, opened in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is not the first time that American marketing savvy and  
German conservatism have clashed. In a previous instance, American 
producers of Tupperware were banned from advertising an unlimited 
guarantee, so they dropped theirs to 30 years to match Germany 
statute of limitations on lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Zippo lighters avoided legal action by deciding to remove their  
lifetime guarantee from German packaging. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fun in a way to watch Lands' End,'' said Philip Haleen,  
an American lawyer in Germany who has done work for Zippo. ``I've 
been here in Europe for a long time and there's a U.S. way of doing 
business and there's a German way of doing business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	High-court decisions are final in Germany, and Lands' End is  
considering whether to appeal at the European Union-level. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the meantime, the company is trying to get the word out  
to its German customers any way it can -- such as the oblique print 
ads launched last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The company may be aided by the expanding world of electronic  
commerce, which seems to be quickly outpacing German law. Customers 
who log onto Lands' End German site can enter the U.S. site, where 
the guarantee is spelled out. 
</P>
<P>
	And, ironically, the ban has been good advertising.  
</P>
<P>
	In Britain, the company has run print ads proclaiming: ``A  
Guarantee so good the Germans banned it.''

<HEADLINE> House Finances Deemed Healthy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Private auditors have given a clean audit for  
the first time to House financial operations, which in the past 
have been characterized by scandal and mismanagement, House 
Republicans announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of our crowning achievements,'' said Rep. John  
Boehner, R-Ohio, a leader in GOP efforts to run the House more like 
a business. ``This is a day I thought I'd never see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, in a report on 1998  
House operations, said real progress was made in correcting past 
problems. The auditors found ``no instances of noncompliance'' with 
laws and regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Their report listed five remaining internal control weaknesses,  
including an outdated payroll system, poor controls over computers 
and data and poor tracking of foods and services, but said progress 
was being made even in those areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an exciting day for many of us,'' said House  
Administration Committee Chairman Bill Thomas, R-Calif. 
``Considering the hill that we had to climb it is a significant 
accomplishment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the first acts of the new Republican majority in 1995 was  
to make the House accountable to the same financial standards that 
private businesses must abide by. Some subsidized operations, such 
as the House barbershop and restaurant, were turned over to private 
management, and the U.S. Postal Service took over the post office. 
</P>
<P>
	Then-Speaker Newt Gingrich ordered the first outside audit of  
House operations, which found considerable problems, including $14 
million in over-budget spending by House offices, but also 
concluded that the lack of organization in the often handwritten 
books made a true assessment difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``The books were so bad, the computer files were so inept and  
ambiguous, that they really couldn't find anything,'' said House 
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the House  
Administration panel, said efforts to professionalize House 
operations began under Speaker Tom Foley, a Democrat, but the 
Republican leadership ``deserves a fair amount of the credit for 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Republicans took over in 1995 looking for major  
irregularities but instead found mostly poor bookkeeping. ``It was 
a sloppy system, and it needed to be cleaned up,'' Hoyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous Democratic majority established an inspector  
general's office in the House in the aftermath of scandals 
involving the House-run bank and post office. GOP leaders expanded 
the IG office staff from two in 1994 to 20 this year and increased 
its budget from $347,500 to $3.9 million.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants Congress' Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Deriding the Republican tax cut he just  
vetoed, President Clinton criticized GOP presidential candidate 
George W. Bush today for a policy address promising better military 
pay and new weapons if he were elected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought to myself, `That's a nice speech, but if I sign this  
tax bill he's for there won't be any money for the promise he just 
made,''' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing a gathering of party officials, Clinton also called  
on Congress to set aside partisan rancor and work on a budget that 
would shore up Social Security, Medicare and the education system. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still believe there's the opportunity for us to work  
together,'' Clinton said of the Republican leadership on Capitol 
Hill. ``This is not an election year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton made frequent reference to the early start to the 2000  
election cycle in his remarks to the annual meeting of the 
Democratic National Committee. He noted that he didn't announce his 
first presidential bid until October 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I've been going through this campaign all my life,  
and I'm not even running,'' he quipped. 
</P>
<P>
	More to the point, he gave encouragement to Vice President Al  
Gore, whose campaign to move into the Oval Office has struggled to 
gain support in public opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Without mentioning Gore directly, Clinton noted that he was in  
third place and the pundits were giving him long odds when the 
voting public finally began to focus on the race in June 1992 and 
he won primaries in California, New Jersey and Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	``It became real,'' Clinton said. ``And people began to look and  
listen and they opened not just their minds but their hearts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush offered his vision for the Defense Department in a speech  
Wednesday at The Citadel. He called for greater investment in 
futuristic weapons research and accused the Clinton administration 
of paying military personnel too little. 
</P>
<P>
	Signaling that he will sign a massive military spending bill  
despite reservations about a provision that would reorganize the 
Energy Department, Clinton said Bush was ``ignoring the fact that 
we're just about to pay a big pay increase and build new weapons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he criticized the GOP candidates who supported the  
congressional tax cut proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once again I did the Republican candidates running for  
president a favor,'' Clinton said. ``If I had signed it, it would 
have made a lie out of every campaign speech they're going to give 
between now and the election about what they're going to do because 
they wouldn't have any money to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton used the speech to recap the economic success of his  
administration and champion the work Democrats have done to fight 
crime and toughen gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want you to be of good cheer and proud because America is a  
better place than it was in 1992,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The group cheered when the president mentioned that he had  
vetoed the Republicans' $792 billion tax cut a day earlier because, 
he said, it would have squandered the opportunity to strengthen the 
retirement and health care systems and invest in education. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason I vetoed the tax bill is that it would make it  
impossible for America to meet its long-term challenges,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton told the party officials that their stand on Medicare,  
Social Security and crime would set Democrats apart from 
Republicans in the upcoming elections. ``There really are 
differences between these parties,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always believed if ... we just thought about the people that  
nobody else in Washington seems to think about,'' he said, ``you 
could marry good politics and good policy and everything would be 
all right.''

<HEADLINE> Bill Would Help Subsidized Housing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers hope a bill approved by the House  
Banking Committee on Friday will counter a trend that is reducing 
the amount of government-subsidized housing available for the 
elderly and the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee members approved the bill unanimously in a voice vote  
and sent it for consideration to the full House. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., the author of the bill, said the  
legislation is necessary because tens of thousands of tenants 
across the country are losing their subsidized housing -- or being 
put at risk for losing it -- as landlords drop out of the federal 
program known as ``Section 8'' to seek higher rents on the open 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Over a period of 2 1/2 years, ending in December 1998, nearly  
100,000 units of Department of Housing and Urban Development 
housing, most of it administered under the Section 8 program for 
low-income elderly, disabled and families, have been lost, 
according to the nonprofit National Housing Trust. 
</P>
<P>
	By 2004, HUD contracts covering 1 million units -- some in every  
state -- are due to expire. About half of those units are at risk 
because their rents are below market rates, according to the trust. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, which increases funding for housing programs by $71  
million, seeks to modernize the program and provide incentives to 
building owners to stay in the program. One provision would forgive 
building owners' outstanding governmental loans, which would give 
nonprofit groups relief from heavy debt service. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would also create mixed-income senior citizen and  
disabled housing environments. 
</P>
<P>
	And it would provide incentives for building owners to convert  
government-subsidized and public housing projects to assisted 
living facilities, which provide meals, health care and other 
services to the elderly who need help with the daily activities of 
living. 
</P>
<P>
	Another provision would authorize money for nonprofit  
organizations seeking to purchase, improve and preserve affordable 
federally assisted and federally insured housing for the benefit of 
low-income tenants. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation also would provide market-level vouchers so  
tenants could stay in their buildings even after the buildings have 
gone private, and would promote building sales to nonprofit 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 202.

<HEADLINE> Relief Agency Criticizes IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund is failing to  
complete its mission of reducing poverty in the world's poorest 
nations and needs a radical overhaul, the international relief 
agency Oxfam said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	A report by the group said IMF programs in developing countries  
not only are failing to spur economic growth but also are fostering 
deep cuts in spending on public health and education. 
</P>
<P>
	``IMF staff like to portray themselves as providers of `tough  
love,' prescribing strong medicine to sick national economies,'' 
said Kevin Watkins, author of the 40-page report. ``Unfortunately, 
they are prescribing the wrong medicine in lethal doses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report also accuses governments of major industrialized  
countries, which control the 182-nation IMF, of negligence for 
continuing to insist that poor countries comply with IMF programs 
as a condition for receiving foreign aid and debt relief. 
</P>
<P>
	Oxfam said even though the IMF and the G-7 finance ministers,  
who largely determine its policies, are out of touch. But the 
relief agency said the IMF should be reformed, not dissolved as 
some members of Congress have proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was issued as ministers and central bankers from  
around the world started arriving in Washington for the annual 
meetings of the IMF and its sister organization, the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Among main findings in the report:  
</P>
<P>
	--Growth rates countries of sub-Saharan Africa that following IMF  
programs are less than half of rates required to achieve an 
internationally agreed human development goal of halving world 
poverty by 2015. 
</P>
<P>
	--Twelve out of 16 African countries whose IMF programs were  
reviewed by Oxfam analysts cut per-capita spending on education in 
a region where 47 million children don't go to school. 
</P>
<P>
	--In Indonesia, IMF austerity programs have prolonged and  
deepened a recession that has forced 20 million people below the 
poverty line, ``one of the greatest postwar human development 
reversals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Failure to protect jobs and the education budget in Thailand  
has resulted in a threefold increase in the number of children 
dropping out of school. 
</P>
<P>
	Oxfam, comprising 11 nongovernmental organizations around the  
world, lobbies governments and financial institutions to fight 
poverty and conducts anti-poverty projects in more than 100 
countries.

<HEADLINE> Some Modern Art Goes Back Centuries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's first museum devoted to modern art  
is putting on a splashy show full of the verve -- if not nerve -- of 
a collector who dared see value in less-than-ancient paintings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Renoir to Rothko: The Eye of Duncan Phillips,'' opens Saturday  
at the Phillips Collection, a pioneering mansion-turned-museum that 
began celebrating modernism some eight years before the opening of 
New York's Museum of Modern Art. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibition of some 360 paintings, running until Jan. 23,  
ranges from Pierre Auguste Renoir, the French Impressionist who 
started painting in the mid-1800s, to Mark Rothko, Russian-born 
leader of American abstract expressionists, who died in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	The 78-year-old Phillips Collection is largely the life work of  
one man. A critic as well as a collector, Duncan Phillips saw 
painters going back to El Greco in the 16th century as precursors 
of modernism. Phillips died in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	A favorite of Phillips was Honore Daumier, who liked to  
caricature legislators, lawyers and art collectors in the Paris of 
Renoir's youth. One painting is being shown now, but the collection 
owns six more and 50 of his other works. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past 15 years, the Phillips staff has been working on a  
10-pound, 840-page catalog of its 2,400 works, to be published with 
the opening of the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	In the course of cleaning work for the show, curators discovered  
that one painting had another canvas underneath it -- both by the 
American artist Gifford Beal, who died in 1956. A ``Parade of 
Elephants'' was what the museum thought it had acquired, but below 
that was a picture of a woman and two children looking down a 
hillside, apparently in the Hudson River Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	But neither picture is hung in the show. The curators liked  
another by the same artist. 
</P>
<P>
	Son of a wealthy Pittsburgh glass manufacturer, Phillips had a  
lifelong passion for art. 
</P>
<P>
	His early taste ran to traditional paintings on traditional  
subjects, in dark colors. He was one of 75,000 visitors to the 
famous ``Armory Show'' of 1913, where many Americans got their 
first taste of the dazzling Pablo Picasso, Paul Gauguin and Marcel 
Duchamp's sensational ``Nude Descending a Staircase.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips, like many others, was outraged. He reviewed the show  
for an art magazine, calling it ``stupefying in its vulgarity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But when he reprinted the review in a book 14 years later, he  
wrote: 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of the ideas I was then eager to oppose I am now eager to  
uphold. ... Consistency from youth to middle age is at best a 
stiff-necked virtue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He became a leading supporter of American painter Arthur Dove,  
who has a claim to be the first of the abstract painters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Through his patronage of living artists, Phillips disseminated  
and evangelized modernism to a not-always-receptive American 
audience,'' said chief curator Eliza Rathbone. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit will be on view through Jan. 23 and will not travel.  
Admission is $7.50 for adults, $4 for seniors and students.

<HEADLINE> Teamsters Ready To Strike Overnite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- The Teamsters union is preparing to strike  
nonunion Overnite Transportation, one of the nation's largest 
trucking companies, at a time when the industry is getting ready 
for the holiday shopping season. 
</P>
<P>
	Contract talks broke off last week and the company has no offer  
pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Teamsters spokesman David Cameron would not be pinned down  
Friday on when a strike would begin, saying only it would be 
``sooner rather than later. The Wall Street Journal reported Friday 
that the walkout could begin as early as Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Teamsters have already held two limited strikes against  
Overnite in the past year, but Cameron said that if there is a 
third strike, it will be more extensive, with pickets at all 166 
Overnite terminals. The union also is planning to engage in what it 
calls ``ambulatory picketing'' -- following Overnite trucks and 
establishing pickets at their customers' stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-five percent of the 8,500 Overnite employees eligible for  
union membership are now represented by the Teamsters, Cameron 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ira Rosenfeld, director of corporate communications for  
Overnite, said the figure is closer to 15 percent because 
membership elections at several terminals are being challenged. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,000 nonunion Overnite drivers have volunteered to work  
wherever needed, Rosenfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever they go out, this company is ready,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Rosenfeld said the battle against the union is key to the future  
of the trucking industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are not that many nonunion trucking companies left,'' he  
said. ``If this company were to fall to the Teamsters, the other 
smaller companies would likely be forced to as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cameron agreed about the importance of the dispute. He said  
deregulation and price-cutting in the trucking industry have held 
down salaries and hurt union membership. A successful campaign at 
Overnite could reverse that trend, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides say wages are not a major factor in the strike.  
Rosenfeld said nonunion drivers now make about $17 an hour compared 
to about $19 an hour for Teamsters drivers. In a few years, he 
said, the nonunion drivers will actually make slightly more. 
</P>
<P>
	A major issue is the pension system. Overnite wants to retain  
control while the Teamsters want to put pension money into a union 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Overnite, a subsidiary of Omaha, Neb.-based Union Pacific,  
competes in the less-than-truckload industry, in which the trucking 
company coordinates and consolidates small shipments of less than a 
truckload for pickup and delivery.

<HEADLINE> Phillips Shares Slump on Sale News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BARTLESVILLE, Okla. (AP) -- Shares of Phillips Petroleum Co.  
slumped more than 8 percent Friday as investors reacted to the 
company's plans to sell its chemicals and refining businesses and 
focus on exploration and production. 
</P>
<P>
	The plans cooled off Wall Street's speculation that Phillips  
would be acquired by Chevron Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Mulva, who became chief executive officer in July, outlined  
a new five-year plan for the company on Thursday. He told analysts 
he expects to raise $3 billion from the sale of its natural gas 
gathering, marketing and processing subsidiary and other assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Mulva plans to use some of that money to expand its exploration  
and production business. But Phillips also will increase its 
capital expenditures by 90 percent to $2.25 billion to make 
investments and acquisitions in areas like Alaska, Texas and the 
Permian Basin in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips, the nation's eighth-largest oil company, wants to  
concentrate on developing discoveries made recently in the Timor 
Sea and in China and on its assets in the North Sea, North America 
and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's aim is to double its reserves from the current 2  
billion-barrel level in five years. Much of the growth this year 
will come from the Hamaca project in Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some positive changes in Phillips' strategies,''  
Paul Ting, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, wrote in a 
research report Friday. ``There is no question that Mr. James Mulva 
is intensely focused on restructuring the company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Worried about the cost of that restructuring, and disappointed  
about the unlikely prospects of a merger with Chevron, investors 
pushed shares of Phillips' down $4.37 1/2 to $49.50 on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Mulva will be looking for joint-venture partners to share in the  
cost of the growth. Phillips has looked at joint venture efforts in 
the past with the gas marketing, gathering and processing unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips and Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corp. failed earlier this  
year to forge a joint venture that would have created the largest 
independent refining, marketing and transportation company in North 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies couldn't work out details and negotiations ended  
in March. 
</P>
<P>
	An attempt at a similar joint venture with Conoco failed in  
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The strategic plan marks a new strategy for the company's  
chemical operation, which includes assets worth $2.9 billion. The 
chemical unit includes the production of petrochemicals, specialty 
chemicals and plastics.

<HEADLINE> GOP, Clinton at Farm Bill Impasse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican congressional leaders struggled  
Friday to break an impasse over an agricultural spending bill. The 
Clinton administration had new criticism of the measure's emergency 
farm assistance and trade provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said the measure would fall  
$700 million short of covering farmers' losses from droughts and 
floods this year, not including hurricane damages still being 
counted in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to make sure in this package that there is an  
adequate amount of resources dedicated to those people who have 
actually suffered losses,'' Glickman said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	He stopped short of threatening to recommend President Clinton  
veto the measure, however. ``I'm not signaling anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders have agreed to put at least $8 billion worth  
of farm aid in the bill, including $500 million for weather-related 
losses. But the legislation stalled because of disputes over dairy 
policy and a Senate amendment that would allow exports of food and 
medicine to Cuba and make it difficult for the president to stop 
such sales with other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration is concerned about the trade measure,  
according to lawmakers, because it would require a president to get 
congressional approval before imposing sanctions on food and 
medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would have ``grave implications for our  
nonproliferation, counterterrorism and counternarcotics 
initiatives,'' said Gus Shumacher, USDA's undersecretary for farm 
and foreign agricultural services. He declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	The House-Senate conference committee responsible for writing  
the final version of the spending bill stopped work on Wednesday 
because of the impasse. House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., met 
with Republican members of the panel Friday morning but no 
resolution was expected before next week, lawmakers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're up against a wall on that (bill) and the leadership  
needs to take it on,'' said Rep. Bill Young, a Florida Republican 
who chairs the House Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the House leadership offered farm-state lawmakers  
an additional $700 million in disaster relief in exchange for 
dropping the Cuba and dairy provisions, but the proposal was 
rebuffed by farm organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need the money, but I think farmers know the export market  
is their future,'' said Mary Kay Thatcher, a lobbyist for the 
American Farm Bureau Federation. ``Sanctions are simply the wrong 
message.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dairy dispute involves an Agriculture Department overhaul of  
milk pricing set to take effect next month. Lawmakers in the South 
and East want to scrap the new system and replace it with regional 
price-setting agreements. Lawmakers in the Midwest support the 
proposed changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Glickman clashed with farm groups over how to  
distribute $5.5 billion that is expected to be in the bill as 
compensation for depressed commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Farm Bureau and major commodity groups want the payments  
calculated on the basis of farmers' ``market transition'' contracts 
with USDA that provide them with guaranteed annual subsidies. The 
groups say that's the best way of ensuring USDA issues the checks 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman wants to set up a new system. Payments under the market  
transition contracts are based on outdated planting patterns, not 
what farmers grew this year, and he says some of the money will go 
to producers who didn't even plant a crop.

<HEADLINE> Royals' Closer Montgomery To Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Kansas City closer Jeff Montgomery, one  
of 11 players to save 300 games in his career, will retire at the 
end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomery, who earned his 300th save last month, has 12 saves  
this season and seven of the Royals' 30 blown saves. He is 1-4 with 
a 6.34 ERA and hitters are batting .342 against him. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last few months of last year were real positive, but this  
year has not been the same,'' he said. ``The big thing is knowing 
that I'm not a fit anymore. I'm 37. When this team gets to a point 
where it is competitive, it needs someone that is definitely going 
to be there. Because of the years, it can't be me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomery battled a shoulder problem last year and a hip  
problem this year, limiting his effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomery has 304 saves in his career, all for the Royals. He  
is the only member of the 300-save club to record all of them with 
one team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once you get the 300th save, you get to a different level as  
far as recognition,'' he said. ``It puts you on the map a little 
more. The fact that I was able to accomplish that goal with Kansas 
City, all with one team, is very satisfying to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomery, acquired from the Cincinnati Reds on Feb. 13, 1988  
for Van Snider, took over the Royals' closing job from Dan 
Quisenberry midway through the 1990 season and has held it since. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was fortunate to come into an organization at a time when  
they needed someone who does what I do,'' he said. ``They stuck 
with me. The team and I have both given over the years on certain 
occasions. It's been a good fit.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Enters Final Stage of Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee is entering  
the final stages of a reform process designed to reshape the 
organization after its worst crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 10 months after the IOC became engulfed in a vote-buying  
scandal that battered its image and credibility, a special panel 
meets this weekend to review proposed changes in the committee's 
structure, rules and procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	New rules on age limits, term limits, member selection and the  
Olympic bidding process will be discussed by the executive 
committee of IOC 2000, a reform commission set up in the wake of 
the Salt Lake City bribery affair. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC purged 10 members (six were expelled and four resigned)  
in connection with $1.2 million worth of cash, gifts, travel and 
other inducements stemming from Salt Lake City's successful bid for 
the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	But the house-cleaning was seen only as a short-term response,  
with observers and critics waiting to see whether the IOC enacts 
lasting reforms to make the organization more accountable and less 
open to corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	The 80-member IOC 2000 panel was split into three working  
groups, which will present reports Saturday to a closed meeting of 
the 26-member executive body at Lausanne, Switzerland. The 13 
non-IOC members on the executive group include former Secretary of 
State Henry Kissinger and fomer United Nations Secretary-General 
Boutros Boutros-Ghali. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive's recommendations will be put to the full reform  
commission Oct. 30-31. They will then be submitted for a vote by 
the entire IOC at a special session at Lausanne Dec. 11-12 . 
</P>
<P>
	``These will be very important changes,'' IOC president Juan  
Antonio Samaranch said. 
</P>
<P>
	The weekend meetings come at a time when the IOC is facing fresh  
scrutiny amid allegations of vote-buying associated with Atlanta's 
winning bid for the 1996 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	A report delivered to Congress this week detailed how Atlanta  
bidders lavished gifts, college scholarships, job offers and other 
inducements on IOC members and their families. 
</P>
<P>
	The House commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigation  
will hold hearings into the bid process next month. Rep. Fred 
Upton, R-Mich., said the panel will subpoena Samaranch to testify 
if he doesn't appear voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC vice president Dick Pound hopes Congress will take into  
account ``the massive reform'' which the organization has embarked 
upon in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've implemented much more than the critics ever  
expected,'' executive board member Jacques Rogge said. ``We did not 
act under pressure from anybody ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Olympic Committee president Bill Hybl, a member of the IOC  
2000 group, said, ``The changes will be substantive, not cosmetic. 
The reforms are significant ..'' 
</P>
<P>
	Based on numerous interviews with members of the panel, here is  
a look at some of the key proposals: 
</P>
<P>
	-- One of the most sensitive issues is the age limit. In 1995,  
the IOC voted to raise the limit from 75 to 80 in order to allow 
Samaranch to win another term in office. 
</P>
<P>
	The reform working group is proposing lowering the limit to 70,  
but apparently only for future members. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The panel has recommended instituting term limits for the  
first time, with members facing re-election after eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The IOC president would be limited to one eight-year term.  
That would be a major change from the present system, under which 
Samaranch has been in office since 1980 and re-elected by 
acclamation three times. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Traditionally, IOC members have been essentially handpicked by  
the president. The reform panel proposes the creation of a special 
nominating committee, which would screen potential candidates and 
put names forward to the executive board for consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Fifteen contemporary athletes, elected by their peers, would  
be appointed to the IOC. ``I believe this will be the most 
important short-term and long-term change,'' Hybl said. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Also represented on the IOC would be heads of 15 international  
sports federations and leaders of 15 national Olympic committees. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The IOC will have a maximum of 115 members once all the new  
rules are phased in. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A large majority of IOC delegates (70) should be ``independent  
members'' chosen as individuals and not elected to represent 
constituent bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	-- On the Olympic site-selection process, a ``bid acceptance  
procedure'' would be introduced, requiring cities to meet certain 
technical criteria before being allowed to mount a bid. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Visits of IOC members to bid cities would be permitted only if  
``deemed necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- The final decision on the host city would continue to be made  
in a vote of all IOC members, not by the executive board or other 
small panel.

<HEADLINE> House Bill Might Help Young Boxers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House members eager to protect young fighters  
from unscrupulous promoters moved ahead legislation today that 
would set up new federal rules for professional boxing. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., called the bill a way to  
``re-establish boxing as the honest and clean sport so many of us 
grew up appreciating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The measure was approved by the House Commerce consumer  
protection subcommittee on a 15-1 vote. The dissenter, Rep. Bobby 
Rush, D-Ill., said he wanted to discuss the bill with Muhammad Ali 
before supporting it. The bill is named in honor of the former 
heavyweight champion, who testified in favor of it in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure now goes to the full committee.  
</P>
<P>
	``For too long in boxing, the fix has been in. Boxers and fans  
deserve fair fights,'' said Rep. Mike Oxley, R-Ohio, sponsor of the 
bill, which would require promoters to file financial disclosure 
forms and prohibit conflicts of interest between promoters and 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would make it illegal for a fighter to sign any  
contract extending longer than five years. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to the fury over the Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis  
bout earlier this year, it also would require all boxing referees 
and judges to be certified and approved by state boxing 
commissions. 
</P>
<P>
	It addition, the bill specifies that boxers can be suspended for  
unsportsmanlike conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., wrote the bill, which passed the  
Senate unanimously, and cooperated with House members in writing 
changes that were incorporated into the measure today. The 
five-year limit on contracts was one such change; McCain initially 
wanted no contract to last longer than one year. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bills are S.305 and H.R.1832.

<HEADLINE> IMF To Help Y2K-Stricken Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund said Friday  
that it will offer special loans to countries whose economies 
encounter problems caused by the Y2K computer bug. 
</P>
<P>
	But Managing Director Michel Camdessus said it was possible the  
funds might not be used because businesses, financial institutions 
and governments have made considerable progress in preparing their 
computers for any problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no reason to believe that there will be widespread Y2K  
problems or associated balance of payments difficulties,'' 
Camdessus said in a statement. ``In fact, it may well be that the 
Y2K facility will not be used.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Nevertheless, there are uncertainties, and the potential  
consequences for international trade and growth of possible 
interruptions to production and shipments may be significant,'' he 
said. ``Equally important is the potential for temporary 
interruptions to international capital flows in response to 
perceived problems that may -- or may not -- materialize.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF chief said the Y2K fund will provide rapid, short-term  
assistance to the 182 IMF member countries and must be repaid 
within six months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K concern is that computer programs that read only the  
last two digits of the year might mistake 2000 for 1900 and cause 
systems to go haywire. 
</P>
<P>
	Industrial nations have spent billions preparing for any Y2K  
problems, and many of them expect only minor disruptions. Poor 
countries appear to be less prepared. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Bank has been helping many of these developing  
countries fix Y2K problems with grants, loans and technical aid. 
Some of these countries may be able to revert to manual systems 
still in place while they deal with the changeover.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Breakaway Gaining Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- While publicly insisting the Clinton  
administration does not support an independent Kosovo, U.S. 
diplomats are helping lay the groundwork for a possible peaceful 
breakaway as the Yugoslav province gains autonomy under U.N. 
supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	The quietly evolving policy has its roots in U.S. antipathy for  
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and the actions of Serb 
troops and special police in the mostly Albanian province that 
prompted NATO to bomb Belgrade and force their departure. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the time being, the Serbs of Belgrade have absolutely  
forfeited any right to have any say in the destiny of the people of 
Kosovo,'' Richard Holbrooke, the new U.S. ambassador to the United 
Nations, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke, interviewed on NBC's ``Today'' program, emphasized  
that the loss of Serb control was being enforced by the NATO 
peacekeepers who are in the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Sidestepping the question of whether the United States favors  
independence, Holbrooke said, ``In the long run, the issue will be 
resolved through the U.N. Security Council.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The onetime Balkans envoy went on to say ``the final  
disposition'' of Kosovo would have to be worked out under U.N. 
auspices. 
</P>
<P>
	If Milosevic were to quit, or be forced out -- the administration  
is enthusiastically encouraging his political foes -- the Clinton 
administration might take a different view of Kosovo's future. 
</P>
<P>
	But with Milosevic hanging on, and Kosovo developing new  
Albanian-led institutions as well as an armed ``protection force,'' 
the trend is unmistakably in the direction of self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Before and throughout NATO's 78-day war against Yugoslavia that  
ended in June, the Clinton administration insisted it was not 
trying to engineer further fragmentation of Yugoslavia, from which 
four of its six republics spun off as independent nations earlier 
in the decade. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the United States has approved moves in Montenegro, the  
smaller of the two remaining republics that make up Yugoslavia, to 
strike an independent, democratic stance. And the pattern is even 
more evident in dealing with Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, a troubled Russian foreign minister, Igor  
Ivanov, reflecting his country's long ties to the Serbs, asked 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to clarify U.S. policy on 
Kosovo's future. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivanov told her of Moscow's ``profound concerns about the  
potential for independence'' of Kosovo, a senior U.S. official 
related afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia had objected to NATO's bombing campaign, and while it has  
some peacekeepers in Kosovo, it is sensitive to Serbia's historic 
religious and other roots in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the U.S. official, Albright told Ivanov ``very  
strongly'' that the best way to head off further splintering of 
Yugoslavia was to get rid of Milosevic. And Albright told Ivanov 
the United States does not support Kosovo independence, the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	In taking charge in Kosovo, the ethnic Albanians have offered  
assurances to the nearly 100,000 Serbs who remain in the province 
that the goal is a multiethnic society. 
</P>
<P>
	At a conference sponsored by the U.S.-funded Institute of Peace  
outside Washington last week that aim was underscored, although no 
Serbs were invited. 
</P>
<P>
	The Albanian formation of an armed protection force, with the  
approval of the Clinton administration, could represent a step 
toward statehood and is bitterly opposed by many Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright on Wednesday defended the conversion of the rebel  
Kosovo Liberation Army into the corps as consistent with attempts 
to develop a civil society. 
</P>
<P>
	The corps will have 3,000 active and 2,000 reserve members, will  
be led by Agim Ceku, the KLA chief of staff, and will have 2,000 
weapons, most of them under lock and key. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright told reporters it was ``quite remarkable'' the ethnic  
Albanians had turned in their weapons after the conflict between 
NATO and Yugoslavia that forced the expulsion of Serb troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is very hard to ask people to give up their weapons and not  
give them anything in exchange in terms of dignity and their own 
personal worth,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Italy  
joined in a statement approving the reorganization of the KLA into 
the civilian corps. 
</P>
<P>
	In a terse statement, Albright and the foreign ministers of the  
four allies said the corps would make a useful contribution to the 
restoration of peace and security for all of the communities in the 
province. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Serbs have threatened to create their own defense force in  
the province that they fear will become independent and be governed 
by the majority ethnic Albanian population.

<HEADLINE> Flooding Devastates N.C. Farms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd's floodwaters could put one  
in seven farms in North Carolina out of business, the state 
agriculture commissioner says. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Jim Graham estimated on Wednesday that up to 7,000  
of North Carolina's nearly 50,000 farms, or about 15 percent, may 
be lost. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ones who are in trouble are the farmers on the edge  
already,'' he said. ``These people may not lose their land. But say 
it takes them a year to dry out and have plantable soil. How are 
they supposed to pay their equipment loans between now and then?'' 
</P>
<P>
	State experts expect the agricultural damage to exceed $1  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot we won't know until things dry out,'' Graham  
said. ``A lot of people haven't gotten back onto their land yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the bright side, Graham said reports that the floods killed  
100,000 hogs -- about 1 percent of the state's total production -- 
were overly pessimistic. He said the loss is believed to be closer 
to 40,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The flooding spared much of the year's tobacco crop, most of  
which was already harvested, but about half the expected 
872,000-acre cotton crop is feared lost, Graham said. The peanut 
and sweet potato crops were also hit hard. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm leaders are lobbying for government relief money.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Demographic Shift Hurts GOP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- For the first time in 15 years, Republicans  
account for fewer than half of Orange County's registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
	In the county that proudly proclaimed itself ``Reagan Country''  
and was a crucial GOP campaign stop, only 49.98 percent of the 
registered voters are Republicans, according to a Sept. 18 count. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Republicans made up less than half of the county's  
voting bloc was during the 1984 primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Once a mainly conservative white bastion, the county has changed  
demographically. Hispanics comprise a large and growing segment of 
the population, and have tended overwhelmingly to register as 
Democrats. Thirty-two percent of the county's registered voters are 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	The ranks of independents and third-party voters also are  
growing. According to the latest count, 18 percent registered with 
third parties or declined to state their affiliation.

<HEADLINE> Bradley's Civil Rights Plan Rebuked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Bradley's suggestion that the 1964 Civil  
Rights Act be expanded to include sexual orientation drew a rebuke 
Friday from the head of the Democratic National Committee's black 
caucus, who called the suggestion ``ill-advised.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas state Rep. Al Edwards of Houston, head of the DNC caucus,  
asked the party's executive committee to pass a resolution against 
reopening the 1994 law they did so unanimously late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The DNC would urge that the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which is  
the benchmark for all other civil rights bills, not be reopened for 
debate or amendments that diminish its existing protections,'' the 
resolution said. 
</P>
<P>
	The full Democratic National Committee, which includes many  
supporters of Vice President Al Gore, could consider the resolution 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley is waging an insurgent's challenge to Gore for the 2000  
presidential nomination. On gay rights, Gore supports the narrower 
-- more achievable, he says -- Employment Non-Discrimination Act, or 
ENDA, pending in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Hauser, a spokesman for Bradley, said the measure was not  
at odds with Bradley's position because the former New Jersey 
senator doesn't favor any changes that would diminish the law's 
``existing protections.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My commitment to the Civil Rights Act will never waver''  
Bradley said. ``As president, I would never sign any law that would 
weaken that act and would use every tool at my disposal to advance 
racial harmony and justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said that during the 1980s ``courageous Democrats sought  
to broaden the protections of the Civil Rights Act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Edwards suggested that any protections for gays and lesbians  
should be handled in separate legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics warn that opening that law to amendment now would give  
the Republican-led Congress a chance to gut its protections against 
racial, gender and religious discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Party leaders also said Friday that Democrats have an edge over  
Republicans on and that the party has been successful at erasing 
its debts from past years. 
</P>
<P>
	During an afternoon meeting, the party's rules panel:  
</P>
<P>
	--Denied South Carolina's request to have its primary on Feb. 19,  
the same day as the Republican primary, rather than later. South 
Carolina party officials pleaded for the change, saying that 
sharing the early date with Republicans would dramatically reduce 
expenses and keep the party more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	--Told Arizona Democrats their plans to allow Internet voting  
from home in that state's primary were not a problem for the DNC if 
they made Internet voting an additional option to absentee voting 
by mail, and not a replacement.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Rallies Democratic Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton rallied fellow Democrats to  
prepare for the 2000 campaign by touting economic accomplishments 
of his administration that he said have made America a better 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, I saw a survey the other day that said that times  
had been so good for so long, the American people couldn't remember 
when it was bad and tended to give everybody good ratings on the 
economy -- Bush, Hoover, the whole crowd,'' Clinton said Friday to 
laughter by members of the Democratic National Committee. He 
referred to former President Bush, father of the current Republican 
presidential front-runner, George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's big advantage in money and the polls over Vice President  
Al Gore and the increased strength of Gore's Democratic opponent, 
former Sen. Bill Bradley, have made some at the DNC's annual 
meeting nervous. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton reassured them that the election was a long way off.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a long time between now and November of 2000,'' he said.  
``In June of 1992, you know where I was in the polls? Not behind. 
Third. Third.'' He said he would never forget his comeback victory 
in California primary June 2, 1992, and subsequent successes in New 
Jersey and Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Americans are not paying attention to politics now, the  
president said. ``For most people,'' he said, ``the election is not 
going on. If you live in Iowa or New Hampshire, it's already going 
on. If you live in Arkansas, you're still worried about the price 
of cattle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton reminded the crowd repeatedly of the economic  
accomplishments of his administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, my economy has made it possible for those  
Republicans to give George Bush all that money,'' he said with a 
grin. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Clinton generally has refrained from attacking Gov.  
Bush, he knocked the Republican for saying he would have signed the 
Republicans' $792 billion tax cut bill. The president vetoed the 
bill Thursday -- the same day Bush promised to increase military 
pay, accelerate high-tech weaponry and develop an anti-missile 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I thought to myself, this is a nice speech but if I sign  
this tax bill that (Bush) is for, there won't be any money for the 
promise he just made,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush was not perturbed by the attention.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm flattered that once again the president has taken time  
from his busy schedule to talk about me and my policies, even 
before I've won my party's nomination,'' Bush told The Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said after he and Gore were elected in 1992 they set out  
to fix the economy. ``And now we have the longest peacetime 
expansion in our history instead of the worst recession since the 
Great Depression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, Clinton's recollection was incorrect. The 1981-82  
recession during the Reagan administration was the worst since the 
Depression. In comparison, the 1990-91 recession during the Bush 
administration was relatively mild. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Friday, the DNC's executive committee approved a  
resolution supporting the 1964 Civil Rights Act and cautioning that 
the ``bill not be reopened for debate or amendments that diminish 
its existing protections.'' Bradley has suggested expanding the act 
to include gays and lesbians, but critics say that once open to 
amendments, the law could be gutted by the Republican Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	And the DNC's rules committee:  
</P>
<P>
	--Denied South Carolina's request to have its primary on Feb. 19,  
the same day as the Republican primary. South Carolina party 
officials pleaded for the change, saying that sharing the early 
date with Republicans would dramatically reduce expenses and keep 
the party more competitive. Now they likely will have a caucus that 
could be held no earlier than March 7. 
</P>
<P>
	--Told Arizona Democrats their plans to allow Internet voting  
from home in that state's primary were not a problem for the DNC if 
they made Internet voting an additional option to absentee voting 
by mail, and not a replacement.

<HEADLINE> Jags' McManus Likely Out for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Jacksonville Jaguars middle linebacker  
Tom McManus will have surgery on a torn tendon in his right foot 
and is expected to be out for the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The fifth-year veteran was hurt last week on Carolina's failed  
2-point conversion attempt at the end of Jacksonville's 22-20 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgery will be done sometime in the next two weeks. McManus  
is expected to be placed on injured reserve in the next few days. 
If he is, he'll be lost for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It burns me out,'' McManus told The Florida Times-Union. ``I  
finally win the job, and then this happens. I was just starting to 
feel comfortable, starting to feel like everything was clicking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McManus beat out Bryan Schwartz for the starting job in  
preseason. Coach Tom Coughlin said either Schwartz or Lonnie Marts 
will start in McManus' spot Sunday when the Jaguars play the 
Tennessee Titans.

<HEADLINE> Bob Barker Recovers From Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Game show host Bob Barker is ready to head  
back home to California after undergoing surgery to clear a blocked 
artery in his neck. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Price Is Right'' host planned to check out today from  
George Washington University Hospital, where he was admitted Sept. 
16 after complaining of fatigue. Tests later revealed his left 
carotid artery was 85 percent blocked. 
</P>
<P>
	Barker, 75, underwent the surgery Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Barker is experiencing a good recovery from surgery and  
will now need to go home and rest,'' his neurosurgeon, Dr. Anthony 
Caputy, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	A longtime animal rights activist, Barker was in Washington to  
lobby for a bill that would ban circuses from using elephants. 
</P>
<P>
	His illness is not expected to interfere with production of his  
CBS daytime show because it is taped well in advance. Barker has 
been host of the program since 1972.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Wants China Firms List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republican leaders complained Friday  
that President Clinton has yet to heed a 1998 law requiring a 
listing of companies tied to the Chinese military that are 
operating in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton sent lawmakers a letter earlier this month saying the  
Pentagon would be responsible for the list. But the Republicans 
said the Pentagon has shown little enthusiasm for the project. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is essential that the president comply,'' said Rep.  
Christopher Cox, R-Calif., chairman of the House GOP policy 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``By violating this statutory obligation, the president shows  
contempt not only for the law, but for congressional oversight and 
the national security,'' Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter was signed by 10 GOP leaders, including Cox, House  
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and Majority Leader Dick Armey, 
R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	As a part of a defense spending bill for the current fiscal  
year, which ends Thursday, Congress set a Jan. 15, 1999, deadline 
for a listing of Chinese Liberation Army-controlled companies doing 
business in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans contend the Chinese military controls a vast network  
of export businesses and other enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese government announced in July 1998 that the Chinese  
Army would no longer engage in commercial activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus, compiling a list of companies that may still have  
unofficial ties with the military is difficult and time-consuming, 
Pentagon officials said.

<HEADLINE> Kids Impressive at Ryder Cup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- The kid can play. And so, too, can the  
rest of Europe's Ryder Cup rookies. 
</P>
<P>
	Sergio Garcia, the 19-year-old European version of Tiger Woods  
known as ``El Nino,'' wasn't the only rookie to stir the crowd 
Friday as Europe took a 6-2 lead in the first day of the 33rd Ryder 
Cup matches. Rookies contributed to the scoring in every match they 
played, and the only rookie to lose was not a European but an 
American, David Duval. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia and Miguel Jimenez of Spain, Paul Lawrie of Scotland and  
Padraig Harrington of Ireland helped the Europeans take a 2 1/2-1 1/2 
lead in the opening foursome matches Friday, and then Lawrie, 
Garcia and Jimenez played key roles in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We no longer have seven rookies,'' European team captain Mark  
James said after the morning matches. ``I think it will do the new 
boys some good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the most closely followed match of the morning, Garcia and  
Jesper Parnevik of Sweden defeated Woods and Tom Lehman 2 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia and Woods, both trained in golf since age 3, were billed  
as the rivalry of the future, a feeling that intensified when 
Garcia and Woods fought it out last month in the PGA Championship. 
But Garcia said that didn't come into play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here it's Europe against the USA, it's not Sergio against  
Tiger. Everybody needs to understand that,'' Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Europeans said they were nervous but didn't lose confidence  
even as the heavily favored Americans jumped to leads in three of 
the first four matches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't feel cool inside, but after that first drive, it  
wasn't that bad, really,'' said Lawrie, who played with fellow Scot 
and Ryder Cup veteran Colin Montgomerie in the morning. They 
defeated Duval, America's only rookie, and Phil Mickelson 3 and 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very disappointed,'' Duval said. ``The match certainly  
didn't seem like it should have been a 3 and 2 match.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Lawrie played well in the match, it was Montgomerie, who  
often has been frustrated playing in the United States, who helped 
his partner allay the jitters by holing several key putts of 6-10 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's like a rock,'' Lawrie said of Montgomerie.  
</P>
<P>
	It was not that the United States team played poorly. Most of  
the matches were close throughout. 
</P>
<P>
	``The striking thing was the standard of play,'' James said.  
``Both teams played fabulous golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payne Stewart and Davis Love III had several chances to put away  
the all-rookie team of Jimenez and Harrington in the morning, but 
managed only a draw worth a half-point. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played good and we got a halve out of it,'' Stewart said.  
``For two rookies, they played extremely well together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was more of the same in the afternoon, with European rookies  
playing in three of the four best ball matches. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson and Jim Furyk had a combined score of 60, yet lost to  
Garcia and Parvenik. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very disappointing,'' said Mickelson, who missed an  
8-foot birdie putt on 18 that would have halved the match. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Parnevik, with four birdies and an eagle on the front  
nine, who kept the Europeans in that match until Garcia chipped in 
for eagle on the par-5, 14th hole for a 1-up lead that stood. 
</P>
<P>
	``A fantastic day,'' Garcia said. ``The rookies have done well.  
Sometimes the people say things that are wrong and we are trying to 
prove that and just trying to play the best we can.''

<HEADLINE> 17 Cuban Refugees Reach Florida </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- A wooden boat carrying 17 Cuban  
refugeess who said they were at sea for a week landed in Florida 
early Friday and asked residents to call police. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12 men, four women and an 8-year-old boy made landfall near  
Palm Beach, just southeast of West Palm Beach, at about 1 a.m., 
said Border Patrol spokesman Dan Geoghegan. 
</P>
<P>
	They reached shore in what appeared to be an old fishing boat  
powered by a diesel engine, Geoghegan said, though the group said 
the boat was homemade. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the group said they were from Camaguey, the largest  
city in central Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten of the Cubans knocked on the door of a nearby residence  
while the others watched the boat, police said. The resident then 
called police. 
</P>
<P>
	Police turned the group over to the Border Patrol, the  
enforcement arm of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. On 
Friday afternoon the refugees were being held for processing at the 
INS's Krome Detention Center outside Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Since October, 2,227 Cubans, including those picked up Friday,  
were apprehended by the Border Patrol after reaching Florida's 
shores.

<HEADLINE> Farm Aid Tied Up Over Cuba, Dairy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A trade dispute involving Cuba and a squabble  
over federal milk policy have derailed for the time being 
congressional action on an $8 billion farmer relief package. And 
neither side in the controversy is showing sign of wanting to 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders had agreed to put the assistance money --  
badly needed to help bail out the troubled agriculture economy -- in 
a must-pass agricultural appropriations bill being worked out by 
House and Senate negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
	But the lawmakers did not resume their talks Thursday because of  
dairy and Cuba trade issues. House GOP leaders told the budget 
negotiators they did not want the dairy issue in the bill and will 
not let the legislation out of the House if it weakens the 
40-year-old trade embargo on Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm groups are pushing Congress to allow the sale of food and  
medicine to Cuba, but that has riled some conservatives and Florida 
lawmakers. The dairy dispute involves an Agriculture Department 
overhaul of milk pricing set to take effect next month. Lawmakers 
in the South and East want to scrap the new system and replace it 
with regional price-setting agreements. Lawmakers in the Midwest 
support the proposed changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're both big (issues). They're both difficult,'' said Rep.  
Bill Young, R-Fla., chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	It was suggested Thursday that an additional $700 million in  
disaster relief for farmers might be put into the bill if the Cuba 
and dairy issues were removed, congressional sources said. But it 
wasn't clear if that will be enough to break the deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
	The aid package includes $5.5 billion in direct payments to  
growers as compensation for a second year of depressed commodity 
prices and additional money for special crops and weather-related 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to get this assistance out to people and we need to  
get it out now,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.

<HEADLINE> Coordination in Drug Fight Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Results in the fight against drug smuggling  
along the Mexican border will not improve much without an official 
to coordinate efforts of 23 federal agencies, President Clinton's 
drug policy director said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is nuts. We've got to have somebody for the local police  
and sheriff to go to,'' Barry McCaffrey told a House panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Some lawmakers said the coordinator should be able to issue  
orders and direct resources for drug-fighting efforts, not just act 
as a liaison among agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an invasion! I don't think we can say coordination is  
the answer,'' said Rep. Patsy Mink, D-Hawaii. ``Somebody needs to 
be in charge. The military might approach this from an overall 
command post.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey said that although he sympathized with that view, he  
did not think it would be possible to get Congress and the Clinton 
administration to agree. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should go for what we can achieve,'' McCaffrey said.  
</P>
<P>
	What is possible, he said, is appointing one official based in  
El Paso, Texas, to coordinate among federal, state, local and 
Mexican officials. Each border crossing post and each of the four 
states bordering Mexico also should have coordinators, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You pulled back from having a coordinator with power and  
punch,'' criticized Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey spoke at a hearing of the House Government Reform  
Committee's subcommittee on drug issues. Despite recent gains in 
money, manpower and technology, a large percentage of illegal drugs 
in America travel over the southwest border, McCaffrey said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not yet reached our purpose of significantly reducing  
the amount of cocaine, heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine coming 
across the border,'' he said. Part of the problem is that federal 
agencies are terrible at sharing information about drug cartels 
with other agencies and local police, McCaffrey said. 
</P>
<P>
	He defended the nation's drug-fighting relationship with Mexico,  
saying that despite widespread corruption in Mexico, U.S. 
authorities are working with Mexican officials who are getting 
results. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's never been more dangerous in Mexico for U.S. law  
enforcement and Mexican law enforcement,'' McCaffrey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Brian Bilbray, R-Calif., criticized the practice of  
returning some smalltime drug smugglers to Mexico without 
prosecuting them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to go after the drug kingpins,'' McCaffrey said, not  
``a rented dupe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone who was rented to smuggle drugs is still a drug  
smuggler,'' Bilbray replied. ``The dupe is the American people.''

<HEADLINE> CDC: Immunization Rates Reach High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- While national immunization rates among toddlers  
have hit all-time highs, federal health officials are still worried 
about the 20 percent who aren't getting all their shots. 
</P>
<P>
	According to figures released Thursday by the Atlanta-based  
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 80.6 percent of 
children 19 months to 35 months old had the complete series of 
recommended vaccinations for diphtheria/tetanus, polio and measles 
in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The diphtheria/tetanus vaccine is given in four shots, while  
polio vaccine is administered in three doses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an education problem,'' said Dr. Walter A. Orenstein,  
director of the CDC's National Immunization Program. ``Between 
state and federal programs, the vaccines are out there, but there 
is a lot to be done in keeping track of kids' vaccine schedules and 
just getting the kids there.''

	Kinkel Pleads Guilty to Murder  
</P>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Kip Kinkel abandoned an insanity defense and  
pleaded guilty today to murdering his parents at home and then 
killing two classmates in a shooting rampage at Springfield's 
Thurston High School. The 17-year-old could get a life sentence 
when Circuit Judge Jack Mattison sentences him for the May 1998 
attack. He told investigators after his arrest that he had ``no 
choice'' but to kill after shaming his parents by getting expelled 
from school.

	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- The multinational peacekeeping force in  
East Timor arrested a leader of a notorious anti-independence 
militia as a U.N. commission today considered investigating 
atrocities in the half-island territory. Troops and armored 
personnel carriers sealed off a central district near Dili's port 
today and conducted a house-to-house search for militiamen. The

talks with the United States. It is the first time since the United 
States agreed last week to ease sanctions against the North that 
Pyongyang formally announced that it would halt the missile

the economic sanctions that it has long maintained against the 
communist North, not just the few it has promised to abolish. South

Russian planes pounded targets around Grozny in the first major 
raid on the city since the bloody 1994-96 Chechnya war. Thousands

the newspaper said significant obstacles remain that could scuttle 
a pact. MCI WorldCom ranks behind AT&AMP;T in the long-distance

Europe to a 2 1/2-1 1/2 lead after the four morning alternate shot

Europe, which has won the last two competitions. Europe can keep 
the cup if it gets 14 points or better.

<HEADLINE> N.J. Man Guilty of NYPD Horse Punch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A man was found guilty Friday of punching a  
police horse in the nose during a rowdy protest rally last year. 
</P>
<P>
	James Hornacek, 35, could spend up to 90 days in jail for the  
misdemeanor crime. The New Jersey man is to be sentenced in two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The electrician was among nearly 40,000 construction workers  
marching on a construction site where non-union workers reportedly 
were on the job when mounted police moved in. 
</P>
<P>
	Hornacek ``looked Police Officer John Reilly right in the face  
and punched his horse dead in the nose,'' Assistant District 
Attorney Carlos F. Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hornacek claimed he just put his hands up to keep from being  
trampled. He rejected the prosecutor's offer of three days of 
community service for a guilty plea and chose to face trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury acquitted Hornacek of obstructing government  
administration but found him guilty of attempting to harm a police 
animal. 
</P>
<P>
	The police horse, Daily News 1, was retired after the incident  
and is living on a rural New York farm.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Strikes Back at GOP Rivals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pat Buchanan accused Republican presidential  
rivals on Friday of `piling on me'' in their criticism of his views 
about Nazi Germany, as he prepared to consult with Reform Party 
founder Ross Perot about possibly leaving the GOP for a third-party 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican and conservative leaders, including at least three  
fellow presidential candidates, have issued harsh judgments of 
Buchanan's campaign book, ``A Republic, Not an Empire.'' The book 
questioned the timing of United States' entry into World War II and 
its participation in the battle against Adolf Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
	In a detailed statement, Buchanan argued that ``liberal  
interventionism,'' not isolationism, spawned Hitler's fascism. 
``While the West is busy erecting Holocaust museums, it has failed 
to study the history that produced it,'' Buchanan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, the United States is handing out war guarantees all  
over Eastern Europe, guarantees a future generation of Americans 
may refuse to honor, guarantees that are driving a defeated, 
demoralized, divided and democratic Russia, with 20,000 nuclear 
weapons, straight into the arms of a Chinese Communist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the book was written to prevent ``that cataclysm.''  
</P>
<P>
	``As for my Republican rivals, opportunistically piling on me,  
to the giddy applause of the establishment, do you really think you 
will be spared should you also violate the normal of political 
correctness and speak the truth to power?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential rivals John McCain, Elizabeth Dole and Steve Forbes  
have questioned Buchanan's writings in highly critical terms. 
McCain said Republicans should welcome Buchanan's departure from 
the party. 
</P>
<P>
	Front-runner George W. Bush said in an interview Friday that he  
wants Buchanan to remain Republican, though he disagreed with his 
opinion that Germany was not a threat to the United States after 
1940. ``Germany (was) a threat,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, meanwhile, was planning to hold a long-expected  
conversation with Perot by telephone in the next few days, 
according to officials close to both men. 
</P>
<P>
	For Buchanan, the call is a matter of courtesy extended to the  
party's founder. He also may get a sense of Perot's feelings about 
his potential candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Reform Party is the house that Ross built,'' Buchanan  
said, ``and I've got a great respect for Mr. Perot and what he went 
through to build that party and to challenge the two incumbent 
parties, and I would certainly want to speak with him about what 
his intentions were and what he believed is best for that party 
because I think he'd have great influence upon what could happen 
and would happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what he would like most about the prospect of being the  
Reform nominee, he talked about his place in the presidential 
debates next fall ``standing up on a platform with W. and Al Gore 
for 90 minutes three times in October in the year 2000 because I 
think the debates would probably then decide the election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan has no assurances from Perot or knowledgeable  
associates that the party founder will endorse him, officials in 
both camps said Friday. Nor does Buchanan know whether Perot would 
agree to not block a Buchanan bid, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	They spoke on condition of anonymity, and have cautioned for  
days that Perot has not tipped his hand. However, Buchanan's team 
has been given strong encouragement by Perot supporters, such as 
his former running mate, Pat Choate. 
</P>
<P>
	One senior Perot adviser said it is conceivable that the party  
founder could enter the race himself if an economic crisis or other 
tragedy triggered a groundswell of calls for his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Perot has said little about his plans for 2000.  
</P>
<P>
	``The deafening silence says that he will abide by the  
collective will of the party and not stand in the way of Buchanan 
or (Donald) Trump or George W. Bush, should he decide to leave that 
failed (Republican) Party,'' outgoing Reform Party chairman Russell 
Verney said, denying that Perot is implicitly backing Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	In another sign that Buchanan is on the brink of bolting, the  
New Hampshire Reform Party postponed its convention this week after 
Buchanan advisers tried to gain control of the party. 
</P>
<P>
	Others mentioned as potential Reform Party presidential nominees  
are real estate tycoon Trump of New York and Minnesota Gov. Jesse 
Ventura, highest-elected official in the party.

<HEADLINE>  Russia Drops More Bombs on Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russian jets fired rockets today at  
targets around the capital of Chechnya in an escalation of its 
attacks on the breakaway republic that has raised fears of a 
full-scale war. 
</P>
<P>
	The air raids followed attacks Thursday in which Russian planes  
pounded targets around Grozny in the first major raid on the city 
since the bloody 1994-96 Chechnya war. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of people have fled as the raids have escalated.  
Today, a line of some 5,000 vehicles jammed a road leading to the 
neighboring republic of Ingushetia. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's raids killed at least five people and injured at least  
21, according to witnesses and local officials. The raids destroyed 
several apartment buildings and targeted a military airfield said 
to be no longer in use. 
</P>
<P>
	Grozny's oil refinery, a key component of the region's  
struggling economy, was destroyed by bombs over the past 24 hours, 
Sheikhahmed Edilov, director of the Grozneft oil company, was 
quoted as saying by the news agency ITAR-Tass. 
</P>
<P>
	Further airstrikes targeted a TV tower and the city district  
where Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov lives, the agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian air attacks come amid fears of a new war. The  
Russian military is building up its forces along the Chechen 
border, but analysts say the army probably is too weak to invade or 
sustain any serious ground conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Maskhadov renewed his appeal for talks with Russia.  
</P>
<P>
	``The catastrophe approaching the Northern Caucasus can be  
averted, saving the lives of hundreds of thousands of Russians and 
Chechens, if the Russian leadership agrees to solve the problems by 
political methods, around the negotiating table,'' he was quoted as 
saying by the Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has defended Russia's strikes on  
Chechen territory. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a war which international terrorism has declared on  
Russia to seize from it several territories that are rich in 
natural resources,'' Putin said during a trip to the Central Asian 
nation of Kazakstan, according to ITAR-Tass. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has said its air raids are directed against  
Islamic militants who twice invaded the neighboring Russian region 
of Dagestan since the beginning of August, and not against the 
Chechen government. 
</P>
<P>
	The militants say they want to carve out a separate Islamic  
state in the Caucasus Mountains region, but Russian officials claim 
they want to seize Dagestan for access to the oil-rich Caspian Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	The militants also want to create ``a criminal province where  
they would train international terrorists, smuggle arms and 
narcotics, hold hostages for ransom and organize large scale 
financial and other scams with impunity,'' Interior Minister 
Vladimir Rushailo said, according to the Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's military has launched scores of airstrikes against the  
militants on Chechen territory in recent weeks. It claims that 
thousands of the militants are braced on the Chechen-Dagestani 
border in preparation for a new attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Putin said today that the Russian attacks are only against  
militants' facilities. But the strikes have prompted an estimated 
300,000 Chechens to flee their homes, the Chechen Ministry for 
Emergencies said, according to ITAR-Tass. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has put an estimated 13,000 troops along the border,  
ostensibly to ward off a new invasion by militants. But the troop 
movements, as well as the air raids, have created fears that Russia 
is planning to invade Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials, including Putin, have repeatedly denied that  
federal forces will invade. But Deputy Chief of the General Staff 
Col. Gen. Valery Manilov indicated today that Russia's campaign 
against the militants would not end soon. In comments picked up by 
Interfax, he called negotiating with them ``a road to nowhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, Alexander Lebed, the former general who helped  
negotiate the 1996 Chechnya cease-fire, said emergency rule should 
be imposed in the whole North Caucasus region. Lebed, now the 
governor of Krasnoyarsk region, was quoted by Interfax. 
</P>
<P>
	Chechnya has run its own affairs since winning de facto  
independence in 1996. Moscow still claims it is a part of Russia 
and has struggled to keep violence from spreading outward to the 
rest of the Caucasus region.

<HEADLINE> Judge Dismisses Black Tobacco Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit that  
accused the tobacco industry of violating the civil rights of 
blacks by specifically trying to sell them menthol cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge John R. Padova ruled Thursday that federal  
civil rights laws do not bar tobacco product manufacturers from 
targeting a specific group of potential consumers in their 
advertising and marketing campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit filed last year claimed menthol cigarettes are  
heavily marketed in black communities and menthol compounds, when 
burned, create additional toxic substances that make such 
cigarettes more dangerous than other types. The plaintiffs included 
several black smokers and two black health groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs' lawyers said it was the first lawsuit brought  
against the tobacco industry under federal civil rights law rather 
than personal-injury or product-liability laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen A. Sheller said he and his clients would study the  
opinion before deciding whether to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a way I'm not surprised, because we knew that this was a  
novel theory of law,'' Sheller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Government studies of smoking have suggested that menthol taste  
makes it easier for people to smoke longer and inhale more deeply, 
the lawsuit claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Although blacks account for about 10 percent of all U.S.  
smokers, the lawsuit said they make up as much as 70 percent of 
menthol cigarette consumers, and are 30 percent more likely to die 
of smoking-related illnesses than whites. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was based on the original Civil Rights Acts of 1866 and  
1870, passed to prevent the victimization of former slaves during 
Reconstruction.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Gov. Edwards Faces More Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Former Gov. Edwin Edwards, already  
awaiting trial for allegedly rigging riverboat casino licenses, was 
indicted Friday on federal charges he took $100,000 to intervene on 
behalf of a failed insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
	Five other people were also indicted, including state Insurance  
Commissioner Jim Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards was accused of charging the fee to set up a meeting  
between the owner of the insurance company and its court-appointed 
overseers after he was out of office. He was charged with fraud and 
conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI wiretaps of Edwards' phone calls apparently picked up  
conversations between Edwards and Brown about the Cascade Insurance 
Co., which failed in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown is the third straight Louisiana insurance commissioner to  
be indicted on federal charges. His two predecessors went to 
prison, and Brown was elected in 1991 as a reformer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel I have been hit like a victim in a political drive-by  
shooting, because I was in the wrong place at the wrong time,'' 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was an innocent bystander caught up in an  
investigation of Edwards. Brown is running for a third term. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, Edwards said he simply charged a fee for a setting  
up a meeting. He did not return calls Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those also indicted were Cascade Insurance operator David  
Disiere and a judge. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cascade investigation is the second part of a probe of  
Edwards. In November, he and five others were indicted on charges 
of rigging the riverboat casino licensing process. Edwards has 
denied any wrongdong. His trial is set for January. 
</P>
<P>
	The new charges against Edwards carry up to 230 years in prison  
and nearly $12 million in fines. Brown could face up to 290 years 
in prison and fines of nearly $14 million.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Reacts to Soccer Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazilian soccer authorities have  
announced a series of suspensions and stadium closings in reaction 
to an increase in brawling, kicking, spitting and elbowing on the 
field and off. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sports Justice Tribunal suspended five players and two  
referees and ordered three stadiums temporarily shut. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those suspended Thursday night were Colombian star Freddy  
Rincon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not accept the canalization of violence in Brazilian  
soccer, nor the lack of discipline,'' said tribunal president 
Sergio Zveiter. 
</P>
<P>
	Rincon, the playmaker of defending national champion  
Corinthians, drew a 30-day suspension for elbowing Flamengo striker 
Leandro. The referee didn't call the foul, but the tribunal saw it 
clearly on videotape. 
</P>
<P>
	Rincon also faces discipline for a subsequent run-in with Paulo  
Nunes of Palmeiras. TV cameras showed Rincon spitting in Nunes' 
face, and the Colombian later admitted he had become enraged when 
Nunes insulted his race and his mother. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribunal also announced sanctions for violence that erupted  
during Atletico Mineiro's recent 2-1 loss to Vitoria. Both benches 
emptied and the game was briefly stopped, and the fighting resumed 
after the final whistle. 
</P>
<P>
	Fabio Costa and Otacilio of Vitoria and Lincoln and Galvan of  
Atletico Mineiro drew 30-day suspensions, as did referee Leonardo 
da Silva. Atletico's Independencia stadium was temporarily closed. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribunal punished referee Paulo Cesar Oliveira for failing  
to report an invasion of the field at Niteroi's Caio Martins 
stadium during a game between Botafogo and Internacional. Botafogo 
fans charged the field to attack their own players because the team 
was losing. Oliveira was suspended for 30 days and the stadium was 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 30-day suspension was imposed on Vasco da Gama's vice  
president Eurico Miranda, who charged onto the field to protest the 
expulsion of several players during a game with Parana. The club's 
stadium, Sao Januario, also was closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Confederation president Ricardo Teixeira blamed the increase in  
violence in part on poor officiating. He said a new, lower age 
limit had forced the many top referees into retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Teixeira also blamed coaches who encourage rough play and a  
rules change this year that suspends players only after five yellow 
cards instead of three. He said the confederation had proposed

<HEADLINE>  Russia Drops More Bombs on Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russian jets fired rockets today at  
targets around the capital of Chechnya in an escalation of its 
attacks on the breakaway republic that has raised fears of a 
full-scale war. 
</P>
<P>
	The air raids followed attacks Thursday in which Russian planes  
pounded targets around Grozny in the first major raid on the city 
since the bloody 1994-96 Chechnya war. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of people have fled as the raids have escalated.  
Today, a line of some 5,000 vehicles jammed a road leading to the 
neighboring republic of Ingushetia. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's raids killed at least five people and injured at least  
21, according to witnesses and local officials. The raids destroyed 
several apartment buildings and targeted a military airfield said 
to be no longer in use. 
</P>
<P>
	Grozny's oil refinery, a key component of the region's  
struggling economy, was destroyed by bombs over the past 24 hours, 
Sheikhahmed Edilov, director of the Grozneft oil company, was 
quoted as saying by the news agency ITAR-Tass. 
</P>
<P>
	Further airstrikes targeted a TV tower and the city district  
where Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov lives, the agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian air attacks come amid fears of a new war. The  
Russian military is building up its forces along the Chechen 
border, but analysts say the army probably is too weak to invade or 
sustain any serious ground conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Maskhadov renewed his appeal for talks with Russia.  
</P>
<P>
	``The catastrophe approaching the Northern Caucasus can be  
averted, saving the lives of hundreds of thousands of Russians and 
Chechens, if the Russian leadership agrees to solve the problems by 
political methods, around the negotiating table,'' he was quoted as 
saying by the Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has defended Russia's strikes on  
Chechen territory. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a war which international terrorism has declared on  
Russia to seize from it several territories that are rich in 
natural resources,'' Putin said during a trip to the Central Asian 
nation of Kazakstan, according to ITAR-Tass. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has said its air raids are directed against  
Islamic militants who twice invaded the neighboring Russian region 
of Dagestan since the beginning of August, and not against the 
Chechen government. 
</P>
<P>
	The militants say they want to carve out a separate Islamic  
state in the Caucasus Mountains region, but Russian officials claim 
they want to seize Dagestan for access to the oil-rich Caspian Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	The militants also want to create ``a criminal province where  
they would train international terrorists, smuggle arms and 
narcotics, hold hostages for ransom and organize large scale 
financial and other scams with impunity,'' Interior Minister 
Vladimir Rushailo said, according to the Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's military has launched scores of airstrikes against the  
militants on Chechen territory in recent weeks. It claims that 
thousands of the militants are braced on the Chechen-Dagestani 
border in preparation for a new attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Putin said today that the Russian attacks are only against  
militants' facilities. But the strikes have prompted an estimated 
300,000 Chechens to flee their homes, the Chechen Ministry for 
Emergencies said, according to ITAR-Tass. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has put an estimated 13,000 troops along the border,  
ostensibly to ward off a new invasion by militants. But the troop 
movements, as well as the air raids, have created fears that Russia 
is planning to invade Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials, including Putin, have repeatedly denied that  
federal forces will invade. But Deputy Chief of the General Staff 
Col. Gen. Valery Manilov indicated today that Russia's campaign 
against the militants would not end soon. In comments picked up by 
Interfax, he called negotiating with them ``a road to nowhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, Alexander Lebed, the former general who helped  
negotiate the 1996 Chechnya cease-fire, said emergency rule should 
be imposed in the whole North Caucasus region. Lebed, now the 
governor of Krasnoyarsk region, was quoted by Interfax. 
</P>
<P>
	Chechnya has run its own affairs since winning de facto  
independence in 1996. Moscow still claims it is a part of Russia 
and has struggled to keep violence from spreading outward to the 
rest of the Caucasus region.

<HEADLINE> Bush to Buchanan: Stay With GOP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Recalling his father's 1992 defeat in a  
three-way race, George W. Bush on Friday urged Pat Buchanan to 
remain a Republican and not bolt to a Reform Party presidential 
bid. ``I'm going to need every vote I can get'' to win the White 
House, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, the GOP presidential  
front-runner also said he supports raising the federal minimum wage 
by $1 an hour but only if states can opt out -- a condition that 
could render a proposed increase meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
	Discussing a range of foreign policy issues, Bush said he had  
the will to force United Nations weapons inspectors back into Iraq, 
and he sided with supporters of the troubled F-22 stealth fighter. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-term Texas governor spoke with typical bravado about  
politics -- ``I think I'm going to be president'' -- but seemed 
unusually guarded and brusque about policy questions, fending off 
requests for details. Voters will find him ``filling in the blanks 
on policy'' on his own timetable, Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 30-minute roundtable with AP editors and reporters, Bush  
said: 
</P>
<P>
	--China is among the potential threats that require a strong U.S.  
military. Calling U.S.-China ties ``a competitive relationship,'' 
Bush said, ``I see nothing on the horizon, no talks about war right 
now, but it is a major issue'' for the next president. 
</P>
<P>
	--Congress should adhere to spending limits in the 1997  
balanced-budget deal. GOP leaders say they will exceed the limits, 
and the Congressional Budget Office says lawmakers are already on 
course to spend part of the Social Security surplus. One day after 
Clinton vetoed the GOP tax-cutting bill, Bush said he won't offer 
his own tax reduction package until ``after the dust has cleared 
here in Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--The Census should be ``an actual count,'' not conducted with  
statistical sampling methods. Minority groups being courted by Bush 
argue that traditional head counts underestimate their numbers, 
which dilutes their political clout. 
</P>
<P>
	On Buchanan, Bush said he disagreed with the conservative  
commentator's view that Nazi Germany wasn't a threat to the United 
States after 1940. He didn't join his GOP rivals in attacking 
Buchanan for expressing the viewpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, a three-time presidential candidate, is on the brink  
of dropping out of the GOP race to seek the Reform Party 
nomination. Republicans worry Buchanan could siphon votes from the 
GOP nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want Pat Buchanan to leave the party,'' Bush said. ``I  
think it's important, should I be the nominee, to unite the 
Republican Party. I'm going to need every vote I can get among 
Republicans to win the election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Buchanan ``inflicted a few'' wounds to his father's  
re-election campaign with a strong showing in the 1992 New 
Hampshire primary. And he agreed that Reform Party founder Ross 
Perot's general election campaign impacted the 1992 race, which 
ended his father's presidency. Perot drew 19 percent, Bush 37 
percent, and Bill Clinton won with 43 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the younger Bush refused to speculate about Buchanan's  
impact in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's too early to judge,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, aides said Bush was not expressing concern that  
Buchanan would hurt him in the general election. In the states that 
matter most to Bush, the campaign believes Buchanan's vote count 
would not tip the scales against the governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said his minimum wage proposal, though not fully formed,  
would give states unconditional ability to bypass a federally set 
wage increase. States would not be able to opt out of minimum wage 
levels already in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Of several measures pending in Congress, Bush said, ``My worry  
about the minimum wage is that if it's applied universally it's 
going to price certain people out of the job market.'' Bush also 
said he had not spoken to GOP leaders in the Senate or House about 
taxes or any other issues pending in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	As president, he would maintain a U.S. military presence near by  
Iraq and use ``good diplomacy'' to return weapons inspectors to the 
rogue nation, Bush said. Asked how his policy would differ from 
Clinton's, Bush said he has ``the will to try to get weapons 
inspectors back in Iraq.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defending the F-22 while some GOP lawmakers try to cut the $65  
billion program, Bush said six of the next-generation fighters 
should be funded while the Pentagon determines whether the planes, 
to be built mainly in Texas and Georgia, are needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he addressed a wide-range of topics over 30-minutes, Bush  
repeatedly brushed off follow-up questions that sought to pin him 
down. One exchange involved abortion and his belief that judges 
should be ``strict constructionists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His father used the same term to describe David H. Souter when  
he nominated him to the Supreme Court, and now many Republicans 
believe Souter's record is not conservative enough. Asked if Souter 
is a strict constructionist, Bush said, ``I'm not going to 
criticize any of the judges my dad named'' and said he hadn't 
watched Souter's record. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush firmly dismissed a question about whether his twin  
17-year-old daughters might want to talk to Chelsea Clinton about 
life in the White House. ``I don't want my daughters to be part of 
the public arena,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Woman Suffocates Three Daughters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (AP) -- A woman who suffocated her three  
daughters while they slept apologized to relatives on Friday as she 
was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge agreed that Megan Hogg, 27, was suffering from  
depression on March 23, 1998, when she slipped into the girls' 
bedroom and duct-taped their noses and mouths. But her mental state 
didn't affect the sentence, which was agreed upon when Hogg avoided 
trial by pleading no contest to three murder charges on Aug. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	``The defendant made three separate cruel, cold and calculated  
decisions to take the lives of her children,'' said San Mateo 
County Superior Court Judge Mark Forcum. 
</P>
<P>
	Hogg drank a powerful mixture of cocoa, pain killers and  
antidepressants in a failed suicide attempt after killing 
Antoinette Michelle Marden, 7; Angelique Jennifer Roberts, 3; and 
Alexandra LeeAnn Roberts, 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry, that's all I can say,'' Hogg told Mary Roberts,  
grandmother to the younger girls.

<HEADLINE> GOP Bill Would Extend Tax Credits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican bill to renew expiring tax  
credits and protect millions of middle-class taxpayers from what 
the GOP called a tax ``time bomb'' began moving Friday in the 
House. It drew a fresh veto threat from the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The individual items in the five-year, $23.3 billion package  
have strong bipartisan support, but Treasury Secretary Lawrence 
Summers told Democrats privately he would recommend a veto because 
the measure would consume part of the projected budget surplus 
before other priorities are met. 
</P>
<P>
	That infuriated House Republicans, who accused President Clinton  
and Democrats of using the ``extenders'' package as a bargaining 
chip in larger spending and tax battles. The president vetoed the 
GOP's centerpiece 10-year, $792 billion tax cut a day earlier, but 
said he might sign a smaller package. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm terribly confused,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas,  
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. ``It is becoming 
painfully clear that the only specific priority for the president 
this fall is higher and higher Washington spending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the top Democrat on the panel, Rep. Charles Rangel of New  
York, said the president was rightly holding the line on spending 
the budget surplus until the future solvency of Social Security and 
Medicare is ensured and the elderly gain a new prescription drug 
benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill is not paid for,'' Rangel said. ``These are very,  
very popular items, but they don't want to work it out with the 
president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Ways and Means Committee approved the extenders package on a  
strict party-line vote after defeating a Democratic alternative 
that would have paid the costs by closing several corporate tax 
shelters. The bill next moves to the full House. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally part of the larger tax cut, the package includes a  
five-year extension of the research and development tax credit 
popular with high-tech industry and manufacturers. In addition, it 
would permanently ensure that middle-class taxpayers who claim 
credits such as the $500-per-child credit do not become entangled 
in the complex, costly alternative minimum tax, or AMT. 
</P>
<P>
	Archer estimated that unless the AMT fix is approved, 1 million  
taxpayers could be faced with higher income taxes -- ``the tax-hike 
time bomb,'' he said -- if they claim too many credits. The AMT was 
originally intended to prevent the wealthy from escaping taxes 
through legal credits and deductions, but it is not indexed for 
inflation and has been affecting more and more people with modest 
incomes. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also renews credits encouraging businesses to hire  
former welfare recipients and people from groups who traditionally 
have trouble keeping jobs. It extends an oil and gas provision and 
one exempting from taxes certain foreign corporate income from 
banking, insurance or financing business. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the bill would be paid for using projected budget  
surpluses, but its $1.5 billion cost in fiscal 2000 would be offset 
by raising taxes on high-income individuals for that year only. 
Also to save money, companies would be temporarily ``suspended'' 
from taking the R&AMP;D credit until Oct. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The veto rhetoric aside, the sheer popularity of the extenders  
and the need to get them done quickly -- the Internal Revenue 
Service says it needs guidance by Oct. 7 to do the proper AMT forms 
-- means they will likely win final approval one way or another. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the package is one more piece of leverage the White  
House can use to push through at least its Medicare reform and 
prescription drug benefit, if not a Social Security fix. 
</P>
<P>
	Toward that end, Summers and White House Chief of Staff John  
Podesta met Friday with Senate Finance Committee Chairman William 
Roth, R-Del., to begin exploring common ground on these issues as 
well as tax relief. Roth has said he will work this fall on a 
Medicare reform bill, including prescription drugs.

<HEADLINE> D.C. Subway Hours Extended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The subway system in the nation's capital is  
going to stay open one hour past midnight on weekends starting in 
November for an eight-month trial run. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11-member board of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit  
Authority voted unanimously Thursday to extend Metrorail's hours on 
Saturday and Sunday mornings. The demonstration project begins 
after midnight Friday, Nov. 5, and will continue until June 30, 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 16,000 transit riders, environmentalists, members of  
groups against drunken driving and others signed petitions 
supporting the extension after D.C. Councilman Jim Graham made the 
proposal in July. 
</P>
<P>
	About 3.2 million people in the District of Columbia, northern  
Virginia and suburban Maryland have access to Metrorail. Although 
an estimated 383,000 passenger trips are logged on the 92.4 miles 
of track on weekdays, ridership on weekends and off-peak hours has 
been low. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say the extra hour could bring additional crowds to  
bars and restaurants after concerts, sporting events and plays.

<HEADLINE>  Burn 1, Revolution 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Oscar Pareja scored in the 70th minute  
Friday night to give the Dallas Burn a 1-0 victory over the New 
England Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	The Revolution have won only twice since the All-Star break and  
remain one point behind Miami for the final Eastern Conference 
playoff berth. Dallas has already clinched a playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Revolution (11-20) had the better of the chances, but Dallas  
(17-13) made the most of its scant opportunities, aided by some 
shoddy defending by New England. 
</P>
<P>
	Pareja got his fourth goal of the year after Mark Santel's cross  
from the left corner was headed to him by Jason Kreis, who was left 
unmarked by John Harkes. Pareja slotted the ball home from 10 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas goalkeeper Matt Jordan had consecutive stops of a header  
by Giovanni Savarese and a spinning kick by Johnny Torres in the 
final minute. 
</P>
<P>
	New England had two chances in the early going. In the ninth  
minute, Joe-Max Moore took a cross by Ted Chronopoulos and struck a 
powerful shot from 5 yards only to be denied by Jordan. Three 
minutes later, Harkes floated a cross to Savarese, who headed wide 
of the left post. At 16 minutes, Harkes put Moore into the Dallas 
area, where he was again foiled by Jordan -- this time from 6 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight minutes into the second half, Ariel Graziani put Pareja  
through on the right side where he knocked a high shot from 15 
yards that goalkeeper Jeff Causey palmed away. The rebound came to 
Santel 17 yards out on the left side, but the Dallas midfielder 
shot right at Causey.

	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- In the first Dutch challenge to  
Big Tobacco, a man suffering from chronic emphysema after smoking 
for 41 years is suing R.J. Reynolds, Philip Morris and two other 
tobacco companies, claiming additives in cigarettes ruined his 
health. 
</P>
<P>
	Wim ter Schegget, 55, quit smoking this week after suffering  
from smoke-related illness for years. He started at the age of 14 
and his habit later led to chronic emphysema, for which he will 
undergo surgery on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ter Schegget says that by the time he realized how dangerous  
smoking was, he was puffing a pack a day and couldn't stop. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter this week to four tobacco manufacturers -- the other  
two are London-based British American Tobacco and Douwe Egberts, 
the leading Dutch cigarette maker -- Ter Schegget's attorney, Martin 
de Witte, informed the companies of his intent to sue for damages. 
He said the Dutch government also was being included in the suit 
for ``failing to sufficiently inform the public of the damaging 
effects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The document alleges that the manufacturers knowingly withheld  
information about addiction-enhancing substances and harmful 
chemicals used to treat tobacco leaves. De Witte said cases in the 
United States and Britain have proved the companies knew of the 
health implications, opening the way for prosecution in the 
Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading the battle against cigarette makers in the United  
States, the Justice Department on Wednesday sued the tobacco 
industry in an attempt to recover billions of government dollars 
spent on smoking-related health care, accusing the companies of 
operating a ``coordinated campaign of fraud and deceit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Dutch case could result in financial compensation,  
De Witte said that is not the suit's aim. He said his client, who 
argues he was misled by marketing campaigns, is pushing for 
sweeping changes in the Dutch tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``The manufacturer is going to have to prove that the product  
isn't faulty and that it has been presented to the public in the 
proper fashion,'' De Witte said. As an example, he pointed to Camel 
cigarettes, which he said are promoted as ``fun, energizing and 
surprising.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Camel is one of the leading brand cigarettes in the suit, which  
also targets the makers of Barclay, Pall Mall, Lucky Strike and 
other well-known brands. 
</P>
<P>
	Smokers' advocates and the companies under attack have rejected  
the case's chance of success before it even reaches the courts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation in the Netherlands is luckily different from in  
the United States,'' said spokesman Ton Wutz of the Amsterdam-based 
group Smokers Rights. ``As a smoker, I think it's ridiculous simply 
because people are responsibly for their own choices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wutz is one of more than 5 million Dutch smokers which make up a  
third of the population in this country of just under 16 million. 
In the Netherlands, smoking is widely accepted at work, in 
restaurants and most public buildings.

<HEADLINE> MCI WorldCom, Sprint Might Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- MCI WorldCom Inc. and Sprint Corp. have been  
discussing a merger that would combine the nation's second- and 
third-largest long-distance carriers, The Wall Street Journal 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	But the newspaper said no deal is imminent and that significant  
obstacles remain that could scuttle a pact. It cited unidentified 
people familiar with the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill White, a spokesman for Sprint, said the Westwood,  
Kan.-based company's policy is not to comment on speculation. 
Barbara Gibson, a spokesowman for MCI WorldCom, based in Clinton, 
Miss., said MCI also declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint alone is valued at nearly $40 billion, while its wireless  
business, which is separated into a distinct tracking stock, is 
valued at about $33 billion. MCI WorldCom's market valuation is 
about $151 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom ranks behind AT&AMP;T Corp. in the long-distance  
business and Sprint is No. 3. Any combination would be closely 
examined by regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI and Sprint have about 30 percent of the U.S. consumer  
long-distance market, while AT&AMP;T holds about 60 percent, the 
Journal said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another obstacle could come from France Telecom and Germany's  
Deutsche Telekom AG, which each own 10 percent of Sprint and are 
partners with Sprint in Global One, a struggling international 
telecommunications venture. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-distance market has attracted a number of new entrants  
in recent years and could soon include the regional Bell operating 
companies, which are seeking permission to offer such service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal said Sprint's nationwide wireless network is a major  
attraction for MCI WorldCom. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, MCI WorldCom engaged in serious negotiations  
to acquire the wireless company Nextel Communications Inc., but 
those discussions fell apart over price, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal said Sprint has held discussions with a handful of  
telecommunications companies, but said negotiations with MCI 
WorldCom have picked up recently. It said the talks are continuing.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Court Upholds Electric Chair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- For the third time this decade, the  
Florida Supreme Court has upheld use of the electric chair, finding 
it doesn't impose cruel or unusual punishment despite a bloody 
electrocution over the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	In its 4-3 decision Friday, the majority pointed to ``abundant  
evidence that execution by electrocution renders an inmate 
instantaneously unconscious, thereby making it impossible to feel 
pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, however, suggested that prison officials consider  
changing use of the mouth strap because of allegations that the 
last inmate to die in the chair couldn't breath due to the 
tightness and placement of the strap. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice Major Harding, who was part of the majority, also  
urged lawmakers to consider offering condemned killers an 
alternative method of execution, such as lethal injection. 
</P>
<P>
	``Execution by electrocution -- with its attendant smoke and  
flames and blood and screams -- is a spectacle whose time has 
passed,'' Justice Leander Shaw wrote in a dissenting opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fiery deaths of Jesse Tafero and Pedro Medina and the  
recent bloody execution of Allen Lee Davis are acts more befitting 
a violent murderer than a civilized state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flames shot out from the headpiece when Tafero was executed in  
1990 and Medina, in 1997. Court challenges followed both, but each 
time the state Supreme Court upheld use of the electric chair, 
which dates back to 1924 in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors determined that Davis' July execution was a bloody  
because he had a nosebleed just before the current was switched on. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 38 states with capital punishment, only Florida, Georgia,  
Alabama and Nebraska use the electric chair as their sole execution 
method. 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge to Florida's use of the electric chair was brought  
by death row inmate Thomas Provenzano, who was scheduled to die in 
the electric chair Friday for the 1984 murder of an Orlando court 
bailiff. Provenzano's execution was delayed for a second hearing on 
his sanity. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyer Martin McClain, who argued the case for Provenzano, said  
there was ``good reason'' to appeal the court's decision to uphold 
electrocution to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't going away,'' McClain said. ``They have decided  
this case today. But it is going to come up again, perhaps in every 
execution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jeb Bush applauded the court's ruling, calling it a  
``resounding victory for all Floridians, especially those who have 
been victimized by the cruel and malicious acts of those inmates on 
death row.''

<HEADLINE> NFL Scoring Big on TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NFL's TV ratings are off to a strong start,  
with nationally televised games the top-rated program in four of 
the past six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The first week of the regular season won two consecutive ratings  
periods. Fox's game between Atlanta and Minnesota received a 13.4 
rating. The Monday night game on ABC between two-time champion 
Denver and Miami on ABC drew a season-high 16.1 rating, counting 
toward the week of Sept. 13-19. 
</P>
<P>
	The run began the week of Aug. 9-15 with the Hall of Fame  
exhibition game between Cleveland and Dallas, yielding a 10.1 
rating for ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	Three weeks later, a San Francisco-Oakland exhibition game, also  
on ABC, earned a 9.1 rating for the week of Aug. 30-Sept. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	The rating is the percentage of television households in the  
nation tuned to a program, and each point represents 994,000 homes. 
Share represents the percentage of television sets tuned to the

<HEADLINE> Dollar Higer, Tokyo Stocks Plunge / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The U.S. dollar gained against the yen today on  
uncertainty about Japan's economic recovery. Tokyo share prices 
fell. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 104.42 yen as of late today, up 0.14 yen from  
its level late Wednesday and also higher than its late New York 
level of 103.95 yen overnight. It ranged during the day from 103.72 
yen to 105.15 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese markets were closed Thursday for a national holiday.  
</P>
<P>
	Broad selling on the Tokyo Stock Exchange was also seen as  
behind the dollar's gain. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped 454.03  
points, or 2.62 percent, to finish at 16,871.73. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the average closed down 607.03 points, or 3.39  
percent, its biggest one-day loss since Oct. 8, 1998, when the 
index fell 799.55 points to close at 13,026.06. 
</P>
<P>
	``The plunge of the Nikkei has invoked fears for Japan's  
economic recovery in overseas investors' minds,'' said Ryuichi 
Takami, vice president of foreign exchange at Sanwa Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``They rushed in to buy dollars to make up for their  
dollar-short positions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some traders continued to anticipate a possible announcement of  
coordinated action by Japan and other Group of Seven industrialized 
nations to weaken the surging yen at a meeting in Washington this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices fell following an overnight drop on Wall Street.  
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 205.48 points, or 2.0 
percent, to close at 10,318.59. 
</P>
<P>
	``Uncertainty over the macroeconomic environment has caused the  
stock sell-off,'' said Yuichi Kohashi, chief strategist at Daiwa 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The rise of the yen in recent months has set off fears that it  
may choke off Japan's fragile economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 48.86 points, or 3.3 percent, to 1,430.42. 
The TOPIX closed down 50.05 points, or 3.27 percent, on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was

<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 109.55 yen at  
midafternoon, down slightly from 109.57 yen late Wednesday in 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark Japanese government bond fell to  
1.7100 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.7950 percent. Its price

<HEADLINE> Phones Coming to Libby Creek </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLTON, Wash. (AP) -- Just in time for the new millennium,  
telephone service is coming to Libby Creek. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the rest of the world is looking at speed and quantity,  
we're looking for a dial tone,'' said resident Joyce Campbell. 
``It's just so exciting, we're ready to break out the champagne.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This week, the Washington State Utilities and Transportation  
Commission approved a proposal from CenturyTel to install phone 
lines to serve about 20 residents near Carlton in northcentral 
Washington's Methow Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	The area was in a rare ``unclaimed territory,'' meaning that no  
telephone company had responsibility for providing service. 
</P>
<P>
	CenturyTel is proposing charging Libby Creek residents double  
its $12 per month basic rate for two years to cover the cost of 
setting up lines. 
</P>
<P>
	If weather permits, phones could be ringing along Libby Creek as  
soon as this fall, the utility told the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	A few people along the rural dirt road now have cellular  
telephones, but service is expensive and unreliable. One person 
gave up a cell phone after receiving a $600 bill, Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	For many years, through rain, snow and shine, residents have  
shared a phone located in a neighbor's unheated barn just down the 
road -- even in times of emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd all write down our calls, and then argue over who was  
going to figure out the bill,'' Campbell said.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Corn and soybean futures prices edged lower but  
wheat futures were higher in early trading today on the Chicago 
Board of Trade ahead of what is expected to be a big harvest 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasts for good weather throughout the soybean belt pressured  
soybean prices, which also fell sharply on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ideal weather also pushed corn lower after it fell to  
eight-week lows the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat opened higher after a report that Indonesia has banned  
some imports from Australia, which could be good news for U.S. 
exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 1 cent to $2.74 1/4 a bushel;  
December corn fell 1/4 cent to $2.08 a bushel; December oats fell 1/2

<HEADLINE> Dems Edgy About Bradley Strength </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore has a big advantage in  
support from the Democratic Party establishment, but some party 
regulars acknowledge Bill Bradley's growing strength in the polls 
makes them uneasy about the consequences of a tough presidential 
primary fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolyn Boyce, vice chairman of Idaho Democrats, said Gore will  
have to spend precious campaign money to fend off a nomination 
challenge from Bradley, while GOP front-runner George W. Bush is 
building up a huge campaign fund for the 2000 general election. 
</P>
<P>
	``It diverts money and Democratic money is so limited,'' said  
Boyce, who was in town Thursday for a Democratic National Committee 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The DNC is a stronghold of Gore support, but some in their ranks  
concede a bruising primary battle could hurt. In a stark contrast 
to the DNC's spring meeting, when Bradley was just beginning to 
make inroads against the vice president, party regulars were saying 
that Gore is vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	One Southern chairman said he had seen a ``sea change'' since  
spring and he worried that Gore's campaign was unprepared for a 
stiff challenge from Bradley, who is running neck-and-neck with 
Gore in recent polls in New Hampshire and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Marcus, state chairman of the Connecticut Democratic  
Party, acknowledged the uneasiness among some party officials, 
saying, ``People who are neophytes tend to get shaken up.'' It's 
less worrisome, he said, for ``those who have been around for a 
while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is good for the party,'' said Iowa party chairman Rob  
Tully. ``I'm seeing a lot of people getting energized who were not 
involved in the past. I think part of that is due to Bill Bradley, 
who is touching people who might be coming back to the party. It 
will be a close race, but it will make Gore a better candidate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore had a much stronger presence than Bradley at the DNC  
meeting, with staff in every meeting, a political table set up near 
the registration desk and a meet-and-greet breakfast scheduled for 
today. He cannot afford to lose support within the DNC, while 
Bradley has never depended upon it, and hopes instead to draw less 
active Democrats and independents to his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, a former New Jersey senator and professional basketball  
player, has demonstrated an ability to raise money, with $7.5 
million in the bank at the end of June. Gore had $9.4 million. 
Bradley has also shown strength in polls in several states with 
early primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen enough surveys to suggest that something is going on  
out there,'' said political analyst Stuart Rothenberg, who 
cautioned that it's far too early to focus on point margins. Party 
activists nevertheless are taking note of polls showing Bradley 
doing better than Gore in match-ups against Bush, partially due to 
Bradley's appeal with independents. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley has shown signs of making it a race in parts of the  
Northeast, and he got the endorsement Thursday of Sen. Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan of New York, the third senator to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why he preferred Bradley over Gore, Moynihan responded  
simply: ``Nothing is the matter with Gore, but he can't be 
elected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, meanwhile, has compiled endorsements from more than 100  
members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gore has the support of most Democratic officeholders,'' said  
Merle Black, an Emory University political scientist. ``He would 
have the party establishment behind him in the South as well as the 
support of most black officeholders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A CBS News poll out Thursday showed Bradley trailing Gore by a  
50 percent to 32 percent margin nationwide among Democrats and 
independents who lean Democratic. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent polls by Gallup and the Pew Research Center for the  
People &AMP; the Press suggest Gore's support is strongest among 
registered Democrats, blacks and women. Bradley runs closest to 
Gore among independents, men and the better educated. 
</P>
<P>
	The increased strength shown by Bradley may be more of a  
statement against Gore than for Bradley, said Andrew Kohut, 
director of the Pew poll, who says some Americans are tired of the 
Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people aren't too familiar with Bill Bradley,'' said  
Kohut. ``Our surveys show that most people, including Democrats, 
are not paying too much attention.''

<HEADLINE> Sales of Existing Homes Off 2.8 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sales of existing homes fell in August for the  
second straight month after hitting a record high in June. Still, 
sales are on track for a banner year. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Realtors said today that sales of  
existing single-family homes decreased by 2.8 percent in August to 
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.25 million units. 
</P>
<P>
	``Interest rates going up steadily over the last six months was  
probably the major factor,'' said Fred Flick, the association's 
vice president of economic research. 
</P>
<P>
	The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 7.94  
percent in August, up from 7.63 percent in July and 6.92 percent in 
August of 1998, the association said, citing figures from Freddie 
Mac, the mortgage company. 
</P>
<P>
	August's sales level was the lowest since May when 5 million  
units were sold. The 2.8 percent decline in August, followed a 4 
percent drop in sales in July. In June, sales hit an all-time high 
of 5.63 million units sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite August's decrease, association officials said they  
expect existing homes sales to post another record year in 1999. 
Last year's record was 4.97 million units. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5.25 million level of existing home sales in August are  
running about 9.2 percent higher than the sales level in August 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Northeast was the only part of the country reporting a gain  
in sales in August, the association said. Sales there rose 7.6 
percent to an annual rate of 710,000 units. Sales were flat in the 
Midwest, unchanged at an annual rate of 1.18 million units. Sales 
in the South were down 1 percent to a rate of 2.05 million units 
and fell 12.1 percent in the West to a rate of 1.31 million units. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the national median sales price for existing homes  
rose 5.3 percent to a record $137,700 in August over the same month 
a year ago, the association said. The median is the point at which 
half the homes sell for less and half sell for more. 
</P>
<P>
	Flick attributed the increase in the median home price to strong  
demand, a healthy economy and a 29-year-low unemployment rate. 
``People can afford to pay,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The association's report follows a government report last week  
that construction of new homes and apartments rose 0.4 percent in 
August, leaving analysts marveling at the continued strength in 
housing despite rising mortgage rates.

<HEADLINE> Grander Hendrix Memorial Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENTON, Wash. (AP) -- For nearly three decades, Jimi Hendrix's  
flat, simple gravestone on a grassy hillside has drawn visitors 
from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Within a year, the Hendrix family hopes to have a far grander  
memorial built at Greenwood Memorial Park for the guitarist who 
seared eardrums worldwide with hits such as ``Purple Haze,'' ``Hey 
Joe'' and ``Foxey Lady.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``So many people were behind it that we just decided to do it,''  
said Hendrix's father, James ``Al'' Hendrix. ``So many people come 
from all over the world (and) when they come here to Seattle, it's 
one of the first things they look for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drawings unveiled Friday depicted a granite dome supported by  
nine pillars. Beneath the dome, surrounded by benches, would be a 
life-size 5-foot, 11 1/2-inch bronze statue of Hendrix as he appeared 
at the Woodstock music festival in 1969, the year before he died in 
London from an overdose of sleeping pills. 
</P>

	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- On a day traditionally reserved for joyous  
celebration, Taiwanese today vented anger at their government's 
bungling of rescue efforts and mourned the more than 2,100 people 
who perished in a deadly earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government reacted too slowly. It was many hours before  
they sent in troops to rescue victims and many hours until they 
sent helicopters,'' said Tsai Chia-ching as Buddhist monks chanted 
prayers for the dead at a Taipei memorial service. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was at least one bright note when rescuers pulled a  
6-year-old boy from a wrecked apartment building where he and his 
family had been buried for 87 hours. Rushed to a hospital, he was 
in stable condition, but suffering from trauma and dehydration. 
</P>
<P>
	The government admits it was not fully prepared to cope with a  
disaster of such magnitude, even though Taiwan is prone to periodic 
quakes. 
</P>
<P>
	After inspecting disaster areas Thursday, President Lee Teng-hui  
criticized the lack of central coordination and inefficient use of 
manpower and supplies, the official news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	He ordered the set up of a ``9-21'' earthquake rescue and relief  
operation center under direct Cabinet control. The earthquake 
struck Sept. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	What is normally a day of happiness, family reunions and  
feasting, the Autumn Moon Festival today was instead a time of 
grieving for many. The flag above the presidential palace in 
Taipei, the capital, flew at half-mast for the second day. 
</P>
<P>
	At a food pickup point, a big box of pineapple mooncakes sat  
open, another sad reminder that today should have been a holiday 
with family celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
	The round pastries are traditionally eaten during the festival,  
the Chinese equivalent of Thanksgiving in the United States, when 
the harvest moon is said to be at its fullest and most serene. 
</P>
<P>
	``Making a new, better life for us is the most important thing  
now,'' said Ong Chi-chai, gathering up donated food amid hundreds 
of tents in the stricken farming community of Chungliao. ``This 
holiday is no longer important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also ignoring the holiday were thousands of Taiwanese and  
foreign rescue workers who were finding few hopeful signs that many 
more survivors of Tuesday's earthquake could be found under 
collapsed buildings and landslides. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan has had more than 4,500 aftershocks, but they were  
gradually getting weaker. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 80 hours into the crisis, the focus began to shift  
from rescue to helping the hundreds of thousands of homeless 
survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three days ago they knew where my friend was but still he is  
not out,'' said a man who would only give his surname Chung as he 
watched a crane dig at a pile of rubble that contained his school 
buddy. Rescuers had given up hope of finding the man alive. 
</P>
<P>
	The Disaster Management Center said today that 2,151 people had  
been killed, 8,140 were injured, 311 trapped under rubble and 33 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
	The official number of trapped stood in glaring contrast to  
media reports, often quoting on-site rescue workers, which said 
hundreds, if not more, were still buried under collapsed buildings 
and landslides. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan's third largest city, Taichung, was bracing for a major  
influx of the dead from isolated, mountain areas where mud and 
landslides reportedly buried large numbers of villagers. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials have said more than 100,000 people were  
displaced by the 7.6-magnitude earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people said it could take months, if not years, for their  
lives to return to normal. ``We're hoping the government will help 
us rebuild our homes,'' said farmer Chen Jung, who lost his home. 
</P>
<P>
	Chen was among some 500 homeless in Chungliao's tent city, which  
bustled today with people lugging boxes of fruit, diapers, bottled 
water and other donated supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid allegations that shoddy construction work was to blame for  
many deaths, authorities arrested a contractor responsible for 
three buildings that collapsed, burying about 100 people. The 
buildings had been made with substandard steel rods, and 
authorities found crumpled up vegetable oil cans had been used in 
place of bricks. 
</P>
<P>
	The official Central News Agency said teams from 25 countries  
and international organizations were working in Taiwan, with more 
on the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``Politically isolated Taiwan has felt the warmth from the  
international community following the natural disaster,'' the 
agency said, referring to the fact that many countries cut off 
diplomatic ties under pressure from China. 
</P>
<P>
	The government announced it would accept a $100,000 donation  
from the Chinese Red Cross but rejected offers of rescue and 
medical personnel, saying teams from many countries were already in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan also turned down official Beijing offers of material  
assistance. Taiwan rejects China's claim that the island nation is 
a province of the mainland and will one day be integrated.

<HEADLINE>  Chrysler Boss To Retire in Shakeup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The well-regarded president of DaimlerChrysler  
AG's Chrysler division, Thomas Stallkamp, will retire Dec. 31 as 
part of a shakeup in the company's top management. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said today that Stallkamp, 53, will leave as the  
head of DaimlerChrysler's North American unit and be replaced by 
James Holden, executive vice president for sales and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	``With our North American sales and profits strong, a new labor  
agreement negotiated and business systems defined, I believe this 
is an appropriate time to explore new opportunities for myself and 
my family,'' Stallkamp said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler also announced it was trimming its management  
board from 17 members to 14 and reorganizing the board's duties. 
Co-chairmen Juergen Schrempp and Robert Eaton said the moves would 
``keep up the momentum'' of the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Also leaving the board is Theodor Cunningham, who will become  
executive vice president for global sales and marketing. The 
current head of the commercial vehicle division, Kurt Lauk, will 
also leave the company effective Sept. 30. And Heiner Tropitzch, 
head of human resources, will be replaced by Guenther Fleig. 
</P>
<P>
	Schrempp and Eaton praised Stallkamp's role in combining the two  
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has played a critical role in making our historic merger  
work, helping set DaimlerChrysler on a course to realize all the 
promise inherent in this landmark business combination,'' Eaton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In an e-mail to employees today, Stallkamp said he was concerned  
his retirement might be seen as a sign of a rift between the German 
and American sides of the company. He said he had left on good 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``In any merger, issues may arise as a result of different  
styles or corporate cultures. But, these issues have been worked 
out, and will be worked out in the future, because they are not the 
result of personalities or national differences,'' Stallkamp said 
in the e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Stallkamp joined the company in 1980, and rose through the  
ranks, taking over as Chrysler Corp. president in January 1998. He 
had been credited with leading a drive to cut billions in costs and 
improving Chrysler's relations with suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	He got the job of president a week before Eaton, then chairman  
of Chrysler Corp., began negotiations with Daimler-Benz AG. 
</P>
<P>
	As the merger deal came together in the summer and fall of 1998,  
Stallkamp threw himself into making it work. He took German 
language classes and learned how to sleep on a red-eye flight 
across the Atlantic, conduct a full day's business in Stuttgart, 
and return to Detroit in time to fall asleep that night -- all 
without jet lag. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview last October, he said Chrysler needed the merger  
to become one of what he called ``the Global 5'' automakers: 
General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co., Toyota Motor Corp., 
Volkswagen AG and DaimlerChrysler. 
</P>
<P>
	``The folks at Daimler-Benz and the folks at Chrysler are a lot  
more alike than you might think,'' he said in another interview 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of the merger, Stallkamp dismissed the idea that one  
company and its culture would inevitably dominate. Chrysler was 
known for having a more freewheeling, open culture, in contrast to 
the more traditional, top-down management style practiced at 
Daimler-Benz. 
</P>
<P>
	He also rejected the view that the deal represented Daimler's  
buyout of Chrysler. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's hardly an apt description,'' Stallkamp said. ``Really,  
it's a birth, the birth of a new hybrid company, one that will have 
an all-new stock, a new name and corporate identity, equal 
representation in senior management from each of the parent 
companies, and dual headquarters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	News of the move helped push DaimlerChrysler's stock to a record  
low closing price in trading Thursday, falling $3.93 3/4 to $66.25 in 
dealings on the New York Stock Exchange. Auto industry analysts 
said the reports on Stallkamp's future, along with concern that 
DaimlerChrysler might miss its financial goals, worried investors. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the shares on the Frankfurt stock exchange edged higher  
today after news of the shakeup was released. The shares were up 
0.6 percent at noon. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the changes announced today, DaimlerChrysler will manage  
its automotive operations in three divisions: the 
Mercedes-Benz/smart division, headed by Juergen Hubbert, the 
Chrysler division, headed by Holden, and the commercial vehicle 
division headed by Dieter Zetsche. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having completed our integration in only 16 months, we are now  
one company. It is vital that we keep up the momentum that we built 
in the integration process to ensure that we maintain our lead in 
technology and innovation,'' Schrempp and Eaton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also announced that Mike Jackson, the head of  
Mercedes-Benz USA, has resigned and will be replaced by Paul 
Halata, head of Mercedes-Benz UK. 
</P>
<P>
	Several key executives, including Schrempp, last month said the  
company was planning to reorganize and reduce the size of the 
company's board of management. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've known from day one and we so indicated that the board of  
management was actually too large for the long term, but we felt it 
was necessary to have everyone involved initially,'' Eaton said 
today. ``We felt it was now time to move on to the next stage in 
the organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eaton is scheduled to leave in two years, and said today he had  
no immediate plans to retire.

<HEADLINE> George Magazine To Stay Alive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A co-owner of George magazine is making plans to  
keep the publication alive, but with fewer issues each year, 
following the death of John F. Kennedy Jr., its charismatic founder 
and editor. 
</P>
<P>
	There had been concerns after Kennedy's death in a July 16  
airplane crash about whether the four-year-old magazine could 
survive without him. 
</P>
<P>
	Hachette Filipacchi Magazines, which shared ownership of the  
magazine with Kennedy, announced Friday the magazine would cut back 
to 10 issues a year from 12 next year but would guarantee 
advertisers a larger circulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting with the February 2000 issue, advertisers are being  
promised circulation of 450,000 per issue of the magazine that 
mixed political commentary and celebrity profiles, up 12.5 percent 
from the current 400,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Kliger, president and chief executive of Hachette  
Filipacchi Magazines, said the reduced frequency ``reflects a need 
to ensure that each issue received the maximum resources and 
attention that it deserves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are committed to the continued success of George, and we  
are aggressively pursuing all roads to that end,'' Kliger said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The new circulation guarantee is higher than the nearly 404,000  
which the Audit Bureau of Circulations says George achieved in the 
last six months of 1998, the latest period for which such figures 
are available. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to boost circulation, the magazine recently cut its  
yearly subscription price to $9.97 from $17.76, Hachette spokesman 
Keith Estabrook said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hachette and the Kennedy family are in continuing discussions  
about how to proceed with the magazine but have not yet reached any 
agreement, Estabrook said. ``We are committed to continuing to 
publish,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hachette Filipacchi Magazines publishes 28 consumer magazines  
including Car and Driver, Elle, Mirabella, Premiere and Woman's 
Day.

<HEADLINE> College QB Throws His Weight Around </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Neo Aoga looks like a lineman, and that's  
exactly what his Azusa Pacific teammates thought he was. 
</P>
<P>
	Then they watched the 300-pound quarterback throw, and could  
hardly believe it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's mouths just dropped,'' Azusa Pacific star Jack  
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams and Aoga are old friends. Williams ran into him by  
chance last spring and told him the Cougars needed an experienced 
quarterback. And the defending NAIA national champions found their 
man, a very big man. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first time I saw him, I said, `Man, this guy's huge,' and  
he is,'' said Peter Shinnick, first-year coach of the school 25 
miles east of Los Angeles. ``But I watched him run around a little 
bit, saw he could move around a little bit, he could throw, 
everything's good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still working off the rust of a three-year layoff, Aoga said  
Thursday he's down to around 275 pounds after weighing a hefty 309 
when preseason practice began six weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was mostly a lot of water weight,'' he said. ``It's still a  
lot of weight. I'm pretty sure I'll be around 255 or 260 by the end 
of the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aoga is 6-foot-2 1/2 and Shinnick his quarterback's ideal weight is  
probably around 250, but added, ``At 250, he'd probably look 
thin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aoga has completed 44 of 91 passes for 707 yards and three  
touchdowns with four interceptions to help the Azusa Pacific get 
off to a 2-1 start. 
</P>
<P>
	Aoga, 26, signed with Utah out of high school in 1991, but never  
played for the Utes. He led national junior college power Long 
Beach City College to terrific seasons in 1994-95. As a 
260-pounder, passed for 1,632 yards for NCAA Division II Missouri 
Western State in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just didn't feel it was the right fit for me,'' he said of  
his decision to leave the Missouri school before his senior year. 
``I didn't expect to play football after that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And so, in Aoga's words, ``I just got big.''  
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, he worked as a bank teller for 10 months,  
and coached at Long Beach Community College before resuming his 
playing career. 
</P>
<P>
	Aoga first met Williams at Long Beach CC in 1994. Earlier this  
year he and Williams happened to be working out in the school's 
weight room. 
</P>
<P>
	``He asked me what I was doing,'' Aoga said. ``He suggested I  
check out Azusa Pacific. I had thought about playing again 
somewhere. It was just a fluke, he was there that one day. It was 
like heaven sent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He immediately impressed the coaches and players.  
</P>
<P>
	``When I got out there, I just got a little adrenaline flowing,  
and started throwing it good,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA requires athletes to use their four years of  
eligibility in five years after starting college. The NAIA has a 
four-year eligibility rule but no time frame. So after taking a few 
summer school classes, Aoga became eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm having a lot of fun,'' he said. ``I'm a 26-year-old stuck  
in a 19-year-old mind, I don't act 26. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I'm just playing very average for me. I'll get  
everything down by the middle of the season. We're winning, and I'm 
playing average, so that's a good sign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, the NAIA player of the year in 1998 while playing  
running back and strong safety, said people are shocked by Aoga's 
quickness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was always taught not to underestimate,'' Williams said.  
``With him, it's hard not to. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes, he still amazes me, the way he can just throw it in  
between two defenders and hit a guy in the chest, the way he can 
read defenses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of Aoga's size, the 5-11, 205-pound Williams said: ``His calves  
are like my thighs. He just has huge legs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aoga said he'd love to get a shot at playing professionally, and  
it might happen. Because of Williams, who's considered a pro 
prospect as a defensive back, several NFL scouts have watched Azusa 
Pacific this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Aoga wouldn't be the first player from the school to make it in  
the NFL. The most notable is Christian Okoye, who led the league in 
rushing 10 years ago with the Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	``They like what they see in Neo,'' Shinnick said. ``They're  
intrigued because of his quick release and arm strength. He's 
playing good now, but he's got to play great, that's the bottom 
line. He's a gifted athlete, no doubt.''

<P>
	CAMP HILL, Pa. (AP) -- Rite Aid Corp. is eliminating 330  
positions to cut costs by $31.5 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The job cuts announced Friday involve corporate and field  
staff-support positions for the Camp Hill-based Rite Aid, which

<HEADLINE> High-Tech Crime-Fight Lab Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINTHICUM, Md. (AP) -- The Defense Department showed off its  
latest arsenal of high-tech crime-fighting tools Friday, a $15 
million computer lab where it can trace hackers across the 
Internet, unscramble hidden files and rebuild smashed floppy disks 
that were cut in pieces. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators will use the new Defense Computer Forensics Lab,  
located in a nondescript brick building south of Baltimore, to 
unravel electronic evidence in cases of espionage, murder and other 
crimes involving America's military. 
</P>
<P>
	Using powerful computers and special software, these 80 digital  
detectives can trace a hacker across the Internet to his keyboard, 
recover files thought to be safely deleted and quickly search tens 
of thousands of documents for an important phrase. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyberspace is ``a new kind of wild, lawless sort of frontier,''  
said Christopher Mellon, a deputy assistant Defense secretary. ``We 
have important national interests, and we have to be able to 
function.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers envision sharing equipment and secret techniques they  
develop to help FBI, state and local authorities prosecute 
criminals who use computers, such as drug-dealers who track profits 
and customers with accounting software. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI even established its own minilab upstairs in the  
building, though most of its digital forensics work will continue 
to be performed in downtown Washington at its headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Virtually every white-collar crime case today brings at least  
one computer, if not a whole network of computers,'' FBI Assistant 
Director Donald Kerr said. ``We need people who are well 
prepared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Ferguson, the lab's director, showed how experts can use  
these high-tech tools to enhance garbled audio recordings -- even 
digitally mute one voice in a conversation to listen to another -- 
and recover computer files from disks and tapes even if they had 
been deleted. 
</P>
<P>
	The lab can dissect virtually any type of computer, from  
handheld devices to Apple computers to those using Windows or even 
specialized software. It's developing a way to analyze all machines 
using a powerful assembly of computers working together, called a 
``Beowulf cluster,'' technology also used by NASA and some Energy 
Department researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	One lab worker, David Lang, demonstrated how investigators can  
reassemble and read from a computer's floppy disk that a criminal 
trying to hide evidence might cut into pieces and crumple. 
</P>
<P>
	The procedure, developed a decade ago but still being perfected,  
takes ``a day if you're lucky, to a month if it's something you 
haven't encountered before,'' Lang said. ``It's basically just a 
jigsaw puzzle to be put back together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson expects to handle about 400 cases each year from all  
the military branches, mostly crimes where a computer might have 
played part in espionage, deaths or sexual assaults. About 10 
percent of cases involve tracing hackers snooping through military 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The new program also trains investigators, who will be assigned  
full time to military posts and bases worldwide. Typical classes 
are three weeks of about a dozen students learning about espionage, 
hackers, networks and special computer hardware. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we intend to handle here is the big and large,'' Ferguson  
said, citing examples where huge amounts of data need to be 
analyzed or where a particularly savvy criminal scrambled his 
digital records and won't give up his password. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Ferguson and others declined to discuss specific cases  
already under way, they described as rare those involving encrypted 
files. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House agreed last week to allow sale of the most  
powerful data-scrambling technology with virtually no restrictions, 
although military and law enforcement officials have long warned 
that criminals and terrorists might also use the technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson said he was confident that techniques to break those  
messages will be adequate once Congress approves a proposal by the 
Clinton administration to give the FBI $80 million over four years 
for the technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Department officials also acknowledged that the lab's  
proximity to the nearby National Security Agency, the government's 
premier code-breaking organization, was a primary factor in 
deciding its location.

<HEADLINE> Mets Trying To Regroup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The New York Mets staggered into Veterans  
Stadium on Friday after being swept in their NL East showdown with 
Atlanta. Manager Bobby Valentine tried everything he could to help 
them forget the Disaster in Dixie. 
</P>
<P>
	``The team has been addressed,'' Valentine said before the game  
against the Philadelphia Phillies. ``It was succinct, I thought. I 
looked around and I didn't see anybody frowning and I didn't see 
anybody looking down about what I said.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine addressed the team after Thursday's 6-3 loss in  
Atlanta. One of the Mets' sloppiest losses of the season came at 
the absolute worst time. The three-game sweep left New York four 
games behind the Braves in the NL East and only two games ahead of 
Cincinnati for the wild card. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the Mets' seventh loss in nine games against their  
nemesis, and their 13th loss in 14 games at Turner Field. 
</P>
<P>
	So there was little doubt that Valentine sought to squelch any  
ideas in the minds of his players that they can't beat the Braves. 
They have three more games against Atlanta at Shea Stadium next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're good and they won,'' Valentine said he told his team.  
``We're good and we lost. They're not perfect, and neither are we. 
</P>
<P>
	``Luckily, they haven't beaten us thoroughly this year. They  
have beaten us more than we've beaten them. Luckily, we play them a 
lot more times this year. We'll see if there's doubt, won't we? 
That's what this is all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Piazza, who hit his 38th homer off Greg Maddux on Thursday  
to set a club record with 118 RBIs, was cautious when asked about 
Valentine's talk. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it was any different than any other postgame  
talk,'' Piazza said. ``Aside from anything that he said, as a team 
we've always felt like we need to improve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets were trying to regroup Friday night after collapsing in  
Atlanta late in the season for the second straight year. New York 
lost its final five games, when only one victory would have put 
them in a playoff for the NL wild card. Three of those losses came 
in the season-ending series at Turner Field. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final game of this series, the usually sure-handed Mets  
were undone by sloppy play. The best-fielding team in the majors 
made two costly throwing errors, both allowing runs to score. First 
baseman John Olerud, who made one of the errors, also failed to 
complete a pickoff when he couldn't get the ball out of his glove 
in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know what about mistakes?'' Valentine asked. ``They blew a  
double play and got picked off three times, but you know what? They 
hit a three-run homer and they won. What can you do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine was still defending Rickey Henderson on Friday, too.  
Henderson hurt the Mets when he tried to score from first on 
Edgardo Alfonzo's double in the fifth. Henderson, hobbled by a 
tight hamstring, hesitated twice and ran through third-base coach 
Cookie Rojas' stop sign and was out easily at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to me that with Rickey, similar plays have happened  
about four times,'' Valentine said. ``He was safe the other three 
times. He was not safe, so it looked bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson tested his hamstring before the game and was in the  
lineup against the Phillies, leading off and playing left field.

<HEADLINE> Reds 5, Cardinals 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Sean Casey's check-swing single drove in a  
pair of runs during a four-run sixth inning Friday night that 
rallied the Cincinnati Reds to a 5-4 victory over the St. Louis 
Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds kept Mark McGwire stuck at 59 homers and overcame a  
three-run deficit set up by their throwing errors to make up ground 
in the NL playoff chase. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati moved within a game of New York for the NL wild card  
as the Mets lost in Philadelphia 3-2 Friday night. The Reds began 
the day 2 1/2 behind Houston in the NL Central. 
</P>
<P>
	Things looked grim in the first inning, when the Reds made a  
wild throw into each dugout and let in a pair of unearned runs. 
Cincinnati has committed eight errors in its last three games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals' lead grew to 4-1 in the fifth when Adam Kennedy  
had a sacrifice fly off Steve Parris (11-2) and the Reds chose to 
intentionally walk McGwire to face Ray Lankford, who lined a 
run-scoring single on the next pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Hammonds led off the sixth with a homer, his third hit  
off Darren Oliver, and the Reds sent nine batters to the plate in 
all against four pitchers to take the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds loaded the bases with one out, and Rick Croushore (3-6)  
struck out Barry Larkin on three pitches to leave it to Casey. He 
checked his swing on a pitch from Mike Mohler, accidentally hitting 
a soft liner to the opposite field for a pair of runs that tied it. 
Greg Vaughn followed with a first-pitch single off Heathcliff 
Slocumb for a 5-4 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Danny Graves pitched out of a threat in the eighth by inducing a  
double play grounder, then finished for his 26th save. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire went 0-for-2 and walked twice. Sammy Sosa also failed to  
homer in the Cubs' 9-0 victory over Pittsburgh, leaving him two 
homers ahead of McGwire for the major league lead. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's first-inning grounder to Larkin at shortstop started a  
run of defensive lapses by the Reds. Larkin threw the ball into the 
Reds' dugout, and second baseman Pokey Reese threw a ball into the 
Cardinals' dugout after McGwire rounded third on Lankford's infield 
single. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, Larkin charged and missed Thomas Howard's grounder for  
a run-scoring single and a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn's RBI single made it 2-1 in the third. Vaughn had led the  
Reds' late run at the playoffs by hitting 13 homers in September -- 
one shy of the franchise record -- and driving in 30 runs. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* McGwire is 5-for-30 career in Cincinnati with four singles  
and one homer. ... The Reds activated 1B Hal Morris off the DL. 
Morris broke his right wrist on Aug. 26. ... Casey flipped 
backwards over the railing of the Reds' dugout while trying to 
catch a foul in the fifth inning and landed hard on his back. He 
got up and jogged back to his position smiling. ... Manager Jack 
McKeon said before the game that he'd like a multiyear contract. 
He's been working on one-year deals. The front office is waiting 
for ownership to change in early October before considering 
personnel matters for next year.

<HEADLINE> Health Care Businesses Income Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Health service businesses took in nearly $881  
billion last year, a 5.4 percent increase from 1997, Census Bureau 
figures show. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospitals made up the biggest share of health-related income at  
$364 billion in 1998, up 4.5 percent from the year before, 
according to the report being released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, health industry income had risen 4.5 percent in  
1997 and 5.0 percent in 1996. For hospitals, the increases were 3.0 
percent and 3.9 percent in those years. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said income for taxable physicians' offices and  
clinics in 1998 was $189 billion, up 5.2 percent. It had risen 3.8 
percent a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Dentists' income rose 6.2 percent to $54 billion and  
optometrists' receipts were up 7.9 percent to $7 billion. The year 
before, dentists' income had risen 7.6 percent and that of 
optometrists, 2.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The health services sector also includes receipts for other  
practitioners, nursing and personal-care facilities, hospitals and 
other health-care services. 
</P>
<P>
	The Health Care Financing Administration also collects data on  
health care spending, which is to be released later in the year. 
Its figures for 1997 showed total health spending of $1.1 trillion, 
but it includes costs, such as drugs, that are not included in the 
Census Bureau report.

<HEADLINE> IMF To Give Colombia $2B in Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Colombia and the International Monetary Fund  
reached agreement Friday night on a three-year aid package worth 
between $2 billion and $3 billion, Finance Minister Juan Camilo 
Restrepo said. 
</P>
<P>
	After a meeting with IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus,  
Restrepo said that details would be announced Monday at a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement from the IMF said the two sides had ``reached  
understanding on all the key elements and policies that would 
support Colombia's economic program for 2000-2002.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, the IMF statement did not mention any amount for the  
aid package.

	``IMF management believes that Colombia's program would help the  
country return to the path of sustainable economic growth while 
continuing to make progress on reducing inflation, restoring 
balance in its external accounts and strengthening the social 
safety net,'' the IMF statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombia is suffering through its worst recession since the  
1930s. The Colombian peso has lost 22 percent of its value against 
the dollar so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The loan is expected to calm Colombia's turbulent foreign  
exchange market, which is controlled by a crawling foreign exchange 
trading band. 
</P>
<P>
	Restrepo said Colombia alone would make the decision about the  
future of the trading band. Other Colombian officials have said in 
recent days it would be continued. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF board is expected to meet in mid October to approve the  
aid package. 
</P>
<P>
	Restrepo said the accord is a general aid agreement, similar to  
agreements the IMF has signed with Mexico, Argentina and Brazil in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement lays out ``how the Colombian economy will perform  
in terms of growth, in terms of external policy, in terms of fiscal 
policy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the agreement is similar to other IMF accords, then Colombia  
would likely be obliged to reduce its budget deficit considerably 
with an austerity plan. That would mean less in government 
transfers for municipalities already unable to provide many basic 
services, a restructuring of a health care system that can't pay 
its bills and a broadening of the tax base in a country with 
widespread tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
	A strict austerity plan also could trigger labor unrest. Unions  
called a two-day general strike in August to protest anticipated 
belt-tightening measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombian President Andres Pastrana visited Washington earlier  
this week seeking $3.5 billion in aid from international sources -- 
mainly the United States -- for a three-year plan to combat the drug 
trade, fortify the legal system and rescue endangered social 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Wednesday he had received ``big support'' from President  
Clinton for his plan.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Council Endorses Gun Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The U.N. Security Council on Friday  
endorsed sweeping gun-control measures, including a ban on private 
ownership of assault rifles, in a bid to curb civil wars, ethnic 
massacres and terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the first ministerial debate on small arms,  
council members unanimously supported a report by Secretary-General 
Kofi Annan on ways to reduce the global stockpile of some 500 
million handguns, rifles, shotguns and assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	While not legally binding, the action is intended to increase  
the pressure on world government to impose stricter gun control 
measures and reduce the arms trade. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 200 million firearms are owned by American citizens.  
</P>
<P>
	``Small arms and light weapons are primary tools of violence in  
many conflicts taking place in the world,'' Annan told the council. 
</P>
<P>
	``The proliferation of small arms, ammunition and explosives has  
also aggravated the violence associated with terrorism and 
organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even in societies not beset by civil war, the easy  
availability of small arms has in many cases contributed to 
violence and political instability,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced: ``The United  
States will refrain from selling arms to regions of conflict not 
already covered by arms embargoes. We encourage other nations to 
establish and observe such moratoria. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright called for a global crack down on arms trafficking,  
citing U.S. laws forbidding its citizens from brokering illicit 
deals anywhere in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	British Foreign Minister Robin Cook told the Council: ``It is a  
tribute ... that nuclear weapons have never been used for half a 
century, and that chemical weapons have rarely been used. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, over the same period the assault rifle has become the  
weapon of mass killing,'' he said, adding that conflicts fought 
with only small arms have killed over 3 million, mostly civilians, 
in the last decade alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Just $5 million would buy about 20,000 assault rifles, ``enough  
to equip the army of a medium-sized state,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Security Council's 15 members supported a statement by the  
council president endorsing Annan's report. 
</P>
<P>
	Annan's report, among other things, recommended:  
</P>
<P>
	--Better enforcement of U.N. arms embargoes on nations and  
regions in conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	--Nations should require arms manufacturers to put serial numbers  
and identification marks on weapons so the diversion of legitimate 
sales into the black market can be monitored. 
</P>
<P>
	--Nations should share information on the registration of guns  
and on legal transactions, in order to trace black market deals.

<HEADLINE> Good Thing US Golfers Weren't Paid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- Maybe it's a good thing they didn't get  
paid. 
</P>
<P>
	Because imagine how many meals the so-called ``Brookline Four''  
-- David Duval, Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson and Mark O'Meara -- and 
their dependents would have missed if their livelihood actually 
depended on the results they produced in Friday's opening round of 
Ryder Cup matches. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning with the morning foursomes:  
</P>
<P>
	Duval and Mickelson lost 3 and 2 to Colin Montgomerie and Paul  
Lawrie. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods and Tom Lehman lost 2 and 1 to Sergio Garcia and Jesper  
Parnevik. 
</P>
<P>
	And continuing with the afternoon fourballs:  
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson and Jim Furyk lost 1-up to Parnevik and Garcia.  
</P>
<P>
	Duval and Woods lost 1-up to Lee Westwood and Darren Clarke.  
</P>
<P>
	Keeping in mind that U.S. captain Ben Crenshaw kept O'Meara  
lashed to the bench all day, that's zero points in four matches 
from the players who stood up at a team meeting last month and said 
they wanted a piece of the roughly $20 million profit the PGA of 
America will make on this singular event. 
</P>
<P>
	If only they wanted a piece of the Europeans that badly on  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The four also happen to be the world's No. 1 (Woods), No. 2  
(Duval), No. 11 (O'Meara) and No. 13 (Mickelson) ranked players. 
Small wonder the Europeans zoomed out to a 6-2 lead, and now might 
find overconfidence their toughest opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to deflate any and all such notions, European captain  
Mark James said, ``I'm sure Ben has a few trump cards up his 
sleeve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If so, it's hard to imagine what they might be.  
</P>
<P>
	The Europeans drilled the Americans in both the alternate-shot  
and best-ball format. They beat the two best U.S. players -- Woods 
and Duval -- playing their own balls. They found a new leader, Scot 
Colin Montgomerie, to take the place of departed veterans Seve 
Ballesteros and Nick Faldo. They got four of their seven rookies -- 
Spaniards Garcia and Miguel Angel Jimenez, Scot Paul Lawrie and 
Ireland's Padraig Harrington -- their baptism by fire without 
getting burned. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe that's why when James was asked to name best decision he  
made all day, he simply deadpanned, ``I had the hamburger for lunch 
-- instead of the chicken sandwich.''

<HEADLINE> GOPers Hail House 'Clean Audit' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans, who gained the majority four  
years ago with a pledge to run the House of Representatives like a 
private business, today hailed their first-ever ``clean audit'' of 
the House's internal finances. 
</P>
<P>
	``Considering the hill that we had to climb, it is a significant  
accomplishment,'' said Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., chairman of the 
House Administration Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, in a report made  
public today, said the House had made significant progress in 
improving its financial management and the audit found ``no 
instances of noncompliance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP majority first contracted for outside audits soon after  
taking over the House in 1995. The first audit found handwritten 
ledgers and little organization. Auditors discovered about $14 
million in over-budget spending by House offices and the awarding 
of contracts without competitive bidding. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said, ``The books were so  
bad, the computer files were so inept and ambiguous that they 
really couldn't find anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In one of their first acts after taking power in 1995, the GOP  
majority enacted legislation holding House offices to the same 
financial standards that the private sector must follow. Some 
subsidized operations, such as the House barbershop and restaurant, 
were turned over to private management. 
</P>
<P>
	``The little city here on the hill was run like a plantation,  
with patronage in terms of employees,'' Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous Democratic majority established an inspector  
general's office in the House following scandals involving the 
House-run bank and post office, but GOP leaders expanded the 
inspector's office staff from two in 1994 to 20 this year, and 
increased its budget from $347,500 to $3.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The audit listed five remaining internal control weaknesses,  
including an obsolete payroll system, poor controls over computers 
and data and poor tracking of foods and services, but said progress 
was being made in all these areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Holding ourselves accountable as anyone in the private sector  
would do'' was one of the party's ``crowning achievements,'' said 
Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio.

<HEADLINE> Court Nixes Late-Term Abortion Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A federal appeals court panel today ruled that  
three states' laws banning late-term abortions are 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  
upheld U.S. District Judge Richard Kopf's decision last year that 
said Nebraska's law is so vague that it potentially bans all 
abortions. The court issued similar rulings for cases out of 
Arkansas and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Appeals Court Clerk Michael Gans said the court dealt with all  
three cases at once because they were so similar. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Nebraska case, Chief Judge Richard Arnold wrote: ``The  
difficulty is that the statute covers a great deal more. It would 
also prohibit, in many circumstances, the most common method of 
second-trimester abortion. ... Such a prohibition places an undue 
burden on the right of women to choose whether to have an 
abortion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska's law is similar to the 1997 federal bill that  
President Clinton vetoed. The case marks the first appeal in which 
the merits of the federal language is considered. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-eight states have adopted similar laws since 1995,  
although the courts have blocked or limited enforcement in 19 of 
those states. 
</P>
<P>
	The late-term abortion procedure involves partially extracting a  
fetus, legs first, through the birth canal, cutting the skull and 
draining the contents. Opponents often call it ``partial-birth'' 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska Attorney General Don Stenberg has termed the procedure  
``barbaric'' and promised his office will appeal the decision to 
the U.S. Supreme Court.

<HEADLINE> House Bill Might Help Young Boxers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House members eager to protect young fighters  
from unscrupulous promoters moved ahead legislation today that 
would set up new federal rules for professional boxing. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., called the bill a way to  
``re-establish boxing as the honest and clean sport so many of us 
grew up appreciating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The measure was approved by the House Commerce consumer  
protection subcommittee on a 15-1 vote. The dissenter, Rep. Bobby 
Rush, D-Ill., said he wanted to discuss the bill with Muhammad Ali 
before supporting it. The bill is named in honor of the former 
heavyweight champion, who testified in favor of it in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure now goes to the full committee.  
</P>
<P>
	``For too long in boxing, the fix has been in. Boxers and fans  
deserve fair fights,'' said Rep. Mike Oxley, R-Ohio, sponsor of the 
bill, which would require promoters to file financial disclosure 
forms and prohibit conflicts of interest between promoters and 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would make it illegal for a fighter to sign any  
contract extending longer than five years. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to the fury over the Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis  
bout earlier this year, it also would require all boxing referees 
and judges to be certified and approved by state boxing 
commissions. 
</P>
<P>
	It addition, the bill specifies that boxers can be suspended for  
unsportsmanlike conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., wrote the bill, which passed the  
Senate unanimously, and cooperated with House members in writing 
changes that were incorporated into the measure today. The 
five-year limit on contracts was one such change; McCain initially 
wanted no contract to last longer than one year. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bills are S.305 and H.R.1832.

<HEADLINE> Bradley, Gore Tied in N.H. Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Another poll shows former New Jersey Sen.  
Bill Bradley has pulled into a statistical tie with Vice President 
Al Gore in the Democratic presidential contest in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	The TIME/CNN poll released Friday shows Bradley favored by 44  
percent of likely voters in New Hampshire's Democratic primary next 
February, compared with 41 percent for Gore. The difference was 
within the poll's margin of error of 4 percentage points, putting 
the candidates in a statistical tie. 
</P>
<P>
	The gap was wider nationally, with 52 percent of Democratic  
voters favoring Gore, compared with 29 percent for Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	In a similar poll last week, 46 percent of likely voters in New  
Hampshire's first-in-the-nation Feb. 8 primary supported Gore, 
compared with 41 percent who supported Bradley. The WMUR-CNN poll's 
margin of error was 5 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest poll, Bradley scored higher with men -- 50 percent  
versus 38 percent -- in New Hampshire, among college graduates --55 
percent versus 32 percent -- and among people earning more than 
$75,000 -- 56 percent versus 33 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore did better among voters under age 34 -- 52 percent versus 33  
percent -- and those earning less than $35,000 -- 48 percent versus 
34 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly half of Gore's New Hampshire supporters -- 46 percent --  
said there was some chance they would decide to vote for Bradley 
instead. Thirty-five percent of Bradley's supporters said there was 
some chance they would vote for Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll of 516 likely voters in the Democratic primary was  
conducted Sept. 21-23 by Yankelovich Partners.

<HEADLINE> Falcons Hanspard Ready To Step Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- Last year, Jamal Anderson was forced to  
carry virtually the entire running load for the Atlanta Falcons 
after Byron Hanspard's season ended with a injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, it's payback time.  
</P>
<P>
	With Anderson out for the season, Hanspard steps up to become  
the No. 1 running back for the NFC champion Falcons (0-2), whose 
season has already reached the desperation stage heading into 
Sunday's game at St. Louis (1-0). 
</P>
<P>
	Though he is only 5-foot-10 and 200 pounds, Hanspard is used to  
being a workhorse, rushing for more than 2,000 yards during his 
final season at Texas Tech in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 23-year-old has yet to prove if he can withstand the  
wear and tear of the NFL, especially on a left knee that underwent 
major reconstructive surgery after he tore the anterior cruciate 
ligament and patella tendon in the final exhibition game of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``The knee is not a problem anymore,'' insisted Hanspard, an  
ordained minister who invokes his religious faith in most of his 
comments. ``God has completely healed my knee. You know how I know 
that? Because God does not do things halfway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson set an NFL record last season with 410 carries --  
averaging nearly 26 per game -- and rushed for a franchise-best 
1,846 yards. Hanspard is willing to accept a similar workload if 
needed, though coach Dan Reeves plans to give second-year back Ken 
Oxendine more playing time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to step up and be the man,'' Hanspard said. ``That  
comes naturally for me. I've been doing it for all my years of 
football, at least until I got to the NFL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Hanspard won the Doak Walker Award as the top college  
running back in the country in 1996, he was drafted in the second 
round by the Falcons. He made an immediate impact. 
</P>
<P>
	The rookie returned two kickoffs for touchdowns and had the  
longest in franchise history, a 77-yarder against Oakland. He also 
had runs of 57 and 53 yards while gaining 335 yards as the No. 2 
back, his speed providing an effective change of pace to Anderson's 
bruising style. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanspard was expected to take on more of a role with the Falcons  
last season, but the knee injury thwarted those plans. As always, 
he relied on his religious faith to get through the ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel God has blessed me to be better,'' he said. ``I feel  
like I'm a stronger player, I feel like I'm a quicker player, I 
feel like I'm a faster player, I feel like I'm a smarter player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hanspard made a couple of phone calls after he learned Tuesday  
that Anderson had torn his ACL the previous night in a 24-7 loss to 
Dallas. The first was to his injured teammate, who is scheduled to 
undergo surgery in a couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, Hanspard called his coach.  
</P>
<P>
	``He assured me that he was fine and ready to go,'' Reeves said.  
``I think Byron has a great deal of confidence. I think that 
confidence will grow the more confidence he has that his leg is 
full speed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While acknowledging that Hanspard is a ``very, very different''  
style of runner, Anderson is confident that his successor can help 
the Falcons rebound from their discouraging start -- especially if 
Chris Chandler is back at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler, who missed the Dallas game because of a strained  
hamstring, has been taking most of the snaps in practice this week 
and expects to start against the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons will likely alter their running schemes, calling  
more sweeps to take advantage of Hanspard's speed, as well as draws 
and screen passes to spread the defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Chris can come back, I think Byron can put up some very  
impressive numbers,'' Anderson said. ``Anybody who rushed for 2,000 
yards in college is quite capable of getting the job done. I just 
told him, `Don't break all my records right away.'''

<HEADLINE> Cards' DT Smith Ends Holdout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- The Arizona Cardinals resolved two long,  
often-bitter contract disputes Friday when defensive tackle Mark 
Smith accepted the team's minimum offer and rookie offensive tackle 
L.J. Shelton agreed to a five-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith accepted the $325,000 tender offer minus the salary he  
would have received for the two games he missed. That means the 
third-year pro will get just under $285,000, far less than the more 
than $1 million he had originally demanded. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he was ready to play football,'' Smith's agent, Gil  
Thompson, said. ``It was an instinctive type of thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton, the No. 21 overall pick from Eastern Michigan and son  
of former NBA player Lonnie Shelton, is the last first-round draft 
choice to sign. Terms were not revealed, and his agent, Lamont 
Smith, did not return calls to his office. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton had held out for a four-year contract or a five-year  
deal with incentive clauses or a fifth year that would be voidable 
had he met certain conditions. Those embellishments have almost 
always been rejected by conservative Cardinals owner Bill Bidwill. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton apparently grew anxious as the season began and agreed  
to a straight deal with no incentives or voidable clauses. 
</P>
<P>
	``The season starting always has a lot to do with tugging at the  
strings. He's probably sitting at home watching games,'' general 
manager Bob Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton had been considered a strong candidate to start had he  
been with the team from the start of training camp. Now he faces an 
uphill battle to even get playing time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously he's a long way behind,'' Ferguson said. ``He's the  
kind of player who's going to come in and compete, but there are 
players already here who are competing at a pretty high level. 
Hopefully within time he'll pick up things but he's got a long way 
to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lamont Smith had filed a grievance against the Cardinals  
accusing them of unfair bargaining, but the grievance was 
dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Smith had virtually no leverage in his holdout. He couldn't  
sign with another team and had to be available to play for at least 
six games this season to count toward him becoming a restricted 
free agent next year and an unrestricted free agent in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's play didn't help him much either. Without Mark Smith,  
Arizona is sixth in the NFL in total defense after two games. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, the Cardinals offered $500,000, but withdrew that  
offer and retreated to the $325,000 Smith was due under NFL rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson declined to say the holdout was a mistake or that his  
client regrets not accepting the $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just a small contract battle in a war,'' Thompson  
said. ``I'd prefer to look forward instead of backward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Vince Tobin said he will have to see how Smith looks when  
he gets to Arizona before making a decision on whether to suit him 
up for Monday night's game against the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no idea what kind of shape he's in,'' Tobin said. ``He  
hasn't seen any of our defenses. ... It probably will be awfully 
hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith had 56 tackles, 31 solos, as a rookie. Last year, as a  
starter, he led the team in sacks with nine. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Greene, the Hall of Fame defensive lineman who as Cardinals'  
defensive line coach worked extensively to make Smith a force in 
the NFL, said Smith has hurt himself greatly by the holdout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had great hopes for Mark, as did everybody in the  
organization,'' Greene said. ``I was extremely disappointed that he 
wasn't here during mini-camp and training camp. I thought he needed 
that to move to the next level. I was disappointed and angry. Now 
that he's here, I've got to get over it.''

<HEADLINE> Phillies 3, Mets 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Mike Lieberthal's RBI single off Armando  
Benitez capped a two-run eighth-inning rally that gave the 
Philadelphia Phillies a 3-2 victory over the Mets on Friday night, 
New York's fourth straight loss. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets, still stunned from their three losses to NL  
East-leading Atlanta, further jeopardized their playoff hopes by 
blowing a 2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	After Masato Yoshii pitched seven strong innings, Dennis Cook  
started the eighth and walked pinch-hitter Kevin Sefcik. Cook 
kicked the mound angrily when he was replaced by Turk Wendell, who 
retired Doug Glanville and Ron Gant. 
</P>
<P>
	But manager Bobby Valentine brought in right-handed closer  
Benitez (3-3) to face the left-handed hitting Bobby Abreu, who is 
second in the league in batting. With first base open, after a 
steal, Abreu doubled home Sefcik on a full count for the tying run. 
</P>
<P>
	Lieberthal hit Benitez's first pitch to right, scoring Abreu  
with the go-ahead run for the Phillies' fifth win in 28 games. 
Scott Aldred pitched a perfect ninth for his first save. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets began the night four games behind the Braves in the  
division and two ahead of Cincinnati for the wild card. The Braves 
were in Montreal on Friday night, while Cincinnati played host to 
St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Grahe (1-3) allowed two runs -- one earned -- and nine hits in  
eight innings with no walks and two strikeouts. It was his first 
victory since 1995 and longest outing since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Robin Ventura hit his 31st homer and John Olerud -- 1-for-13  
against the Braves -- made it 2-1 with an RBI single in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoshii allowed one run and four hits. He walked two and struck  
out three. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets' nightmare at Turner Field prompted a pep talk by  
Valentine following a 6-3 loss Thursday. It worked, until the 
eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	``The team has been addressed,'' Valentine said. ``They're good  
and they won. We're good and we lost. They're not perfect, and 
neither are we.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York had runners at first and second in three straight  
innings and failed to get any of them in. After Ventura's one-out 
homer in the second, Darryl Hamilton and Roger Cedeno both singled 
before Rey Ordonez grounded into a 1-6-3 double play. 
</P>
<P>
	Olerud struck out with runners at first and second in the third,  
and Rickey Henderson was thrown out trying to steal third on a 
double steal for another double play. Ordonez grounded out with 
runners at first and second and two outs in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Phillies tied it when Glanville broke up Yoshii's perfect  
game with a leadoff double in the fourth and scored on Mike 
Lieberthal's RBI single. 
</P>
<P>
	Olerud made it 2-1 and ended New York's string of stranding  
runners with a two-out RBI single in the fifth that scored Yoshii, 
who reached on third baseman Kevin Jordan's throwing error. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Henderson, who ran through a stop sign and was thrown out  
at home in Thursday's loss, tested his tight hamstring before the 
game and played. He was 2-for-4. ... A crowd that included many 
Mets fans was late arriving because of a busy night in South 
Philadelphia. Across the street, the Rangers and Flyers played an 
NHL exhibition game at the First Union Center, and Bruce 
Springsteen gave a concert at the Spectrum. ... Mets LHP Kenny 
Rogers, originally not expected to start in this series, will pitch 
on Saturday after testing his injured left hamstring. ``He's 
probably better now than he was for his last two starts,'' 
Valentine said. ... With a double in the fourth, Glanville is four 
hits away from becoming the first Phillies player with 200 hits 
since Pete Rose had 208 in 1979.

<HEADLINE> Allstate Stock Plunges 11 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Allstate Corp. shares tumbled 11 percent in heavy  
trading Friday after the insurer, hit by stiff competition that has 
forced auto coverage rates lower industrywide, revised its 
second-half earnings outlook sharply downward. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest publicly held insurance company cited  
higher catastrophe losses, including flooding and other damage 
claims from Hurricane Floyd, among a number of reasons for the 
earnings warning. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts downplayed the effect of Floyd on Allstate and  
other insurers and said competition on the Internet and elsewhere 
is a far bigger factor in scaled-back earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``An intensified operating environment, especially in the  
automobile insurance area, is putting pressure on underwriting 
margins of the key players in the industry,'' said Mike Lewis, an 
analyst for Warburg Dillon Read in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one competitor, Progressive Corp., has taken a similar  
hit to its stock after saying it would miss earnings expectations 
due to price cuts and changes in the auto industry. Analysts said 
Safeco, State Farm and Geico are among others affected. 
</P>
<P>
	After plummeting 17 percent early in the session, Allstate stock  
ended the day down $3.50 at $28.25 a share Friday on the New York 
Stock Exchange. More than 16.7 million shares changed hands, more 
than six times the average daily volume of 2.6 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Allstate said its earnings would be well below analysts'  
estmates for the final half of this year, projecting higher losses 
for catastrophe coverage and rising reserves set aside for 
asbestos-related claims. It also cited increased expenses to 
support the company's new marketing campaign and continued 
investments in technology. 
</P>
<P>
	It is among U.S. insurers who will pay homeowners and businesses  
a combined $1.3 billion for insured property damages wrought by 
Hurricane Floyd, according to preliminary calculations released 
Friday by Insurance Services Office Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said third-quarter operating earnings would be 50  
cents to 55 cents a share -- down from 76 cents for the same period 
a year ago and well under the 78 cents expected by analysts 
surveyed by First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth-quarter earnings could be between 65 cents and 73 cents a  
share depending on weather-related developments, said Allstate, 
headquartered in the Chicago suburb of Northbrook. Analysts had 
forecast 81 cents a share, up 3 cents from the fourth quarter of 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward M. Liddy, Allstate's chairman, president and chief  
executive officer, said there is no threat to long-term earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Intense competition in the personal lines industry coupled  
with a rise in the cost of doing business is putting pressure on 
our near-term earnings,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Auto insurers, benefiting from low inflation and a reduction in  
claims as the percentage of young drivers declines, have been 
lowering rates in an intensified scramble for business. 
</P>
<P>
	Allstate executives told analysts in a conference call Friday  
that the company plans to undertake more aggressive marketing, 
spending more on advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	The company plans by the end of the year to announce actions to  
improve its strategic and competitive position after completing a 
review of its cost structure and prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``Management up 'til now has done a very admirable job in a  
tough market,'' said Adam Klauber, an analyst for Cochran, Caronia 
&AMP; Co. in Chicago. ``I think they have made all the right strategic 
moves, but they're fighting in a very tough market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allstate is the second-biggest U.S. company in personal-lines  
insurance -- automobile, home and life insurance -- behind privately 
held State Farm. It had 1998 revenues of $25.9 billion.

<HEADLINE> College QB Throws His Weight Around </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Neo Aoga looks like a lineman, and that's  
exactly what his Azusa Pacific teammates thought he was. 
</P>
<P>
	Then they watched the 300-pound quarterback throw, and could  
hardly believe it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's mouths just dropped,'' Azusa Pacific star Jack  
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams and Aoga are old friends. Williams ran into him by  
chance last spring and told him the Cougars needed an experienced 
quarterback. And the defending NAIA national champions found their 
man, a very big man. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first time I saw him, I said, `Man, this guy's huge,' and  
he is,'' said Peter Shinnick, first-year coach of the school 25 
miles east of Los Angeles. ``But I watched him run around a little 
bit, saw he could move around a little bit, he could throw, 
everything's good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still working off the rust of a three-year layoff, Aoga said  
Thursday he's down to around 275 pounds after weighing a hefty 309 
when preseason practice began six weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was mostly a lot of water weight,'' he said. ``It's still a  
lot of weight. I'm pretty sure I'll be around 255 or 260 by the end 
of the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aoga is 6-foot-2 1/2 and Shinnick his quarterback's ideal weight is  
probably around 250, but added, ``At 250, he'd probably look 
thin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aoga has completed 44 of 91 passes for 707 yards and three  
touchdowns with four interceptions to help the Azusa Pacific get 
off to a 2-1 start. 
</P>
<P>
	Aoga, 26, signed with Utah out of high school in 1991, but never  
played for the Utes. He led national junior college power Long 
Beach City College to terrific seasons in 1994-95. As a 
260-pounder, he passed for 1,632 yards for NCAA Division II 
Missouri Western State in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just didn't feel it was the right fit for me,'' he said of  
his decision to leave the Missouri school before his senior year. 
``I didn't expect to play football after that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And so, in Aoga's words, ``I just got big.''  
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, he worked as a bank teller for 10 months,  
and coached at Long Beach City College before resuming his playing 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Aoga first met Williams at Long Beach CC in 1994. Earlier this  
year he and Williams happened to be working out in the school's 
weight room. 
</P>
<P>
	``He asked me what I was doing,'' Aoga said. ``He suggested I  
check out Azusa Pacific. I had thought about playing again 
somewhere. It was just a fluke, he was there that one day. It was 
like heaven sent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He immediately impressed the coaches and players.  
</P>
<P>
	``When I got out there, I just got a little adrenaline flowing,  
and started throwing it good,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA requires athletes to use their four years of  
eligibility in five years after starting college. The NAIA has a 
four-year eligibility rule but no time frame. So after taking a few 
summer school classes, Aoga became eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm having a lot of fun,'' he said. ``I'm a 26-year-old stuck  
in a 19-year-old mind, I don't act 26. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I'm just playing very average for me. I'll get  
everything down by the middle of the season. We're winning, and I'm 
playing average, so that's a good sign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, the NAIA player of the year in 1998 while playing  
running back and strong safety, said people are shocked by Aoga's 
quickness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was always taught not to underestimate,'' Williams said.  
``With him, it's hard not to. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes, he still amazes me, the way he can just throw it in  
between two defenders and hit a guy in the chest, the way he can 
read defenses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of Aoga's size, the 5-11, 205-pound Williams said: ``His calves  
are like my thighs. He just has huge legs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aoga said he'd love to get a shot at playing professionally, and  
it might happen. Because of Williams, who's considered a pro 
prospect as a defensive back, several NFL scouts have watched Azusa 
Pacific this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Aoga wouldn't be the first player from the school to make it in  
the NFL. The most notable is Christian Okoye, who led the league in 
rushing 10 years ago with the Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	``They like what they see in Neo,'' Shinnick said. ``They're  
intrigued because of his quick release and arm strength. He's 
playing good now, but he's got to play great, that's the bottom 
line. He's a gifted athlete, no doubt.''

<HEADLINE> New Bids Sought for Thai Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- The government is calling for new bids  
for the design and construction of an addition to Bangkok's main 
airport, a newspaper reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The move comes less than two weeks after bidders alleged there  
were irregularities in earlier bidding. 
</P>
<P>
	The call for new tenders will be issued within 45 days, The  
Nation reported. 
</P>
<P>
	A consortium led by a large Thai construction company, Ch.  
Karnchang, had been named the provisional winner of the contract 
after several major rivals were eliminated for failing to meet a 
financing requirement. 
</P>
<P>
	The four foreign-linked consortiums that were ruled out during  
the pre-qualification stage said the requirement, mandating a 
certain kind of bank guarantee, was highly unusual. 
</P>
<P>
	Their main foreign members were Bouygues of France, Nishimatsu  
Construction of Japan, ABB Airport Technology of Germany and Thai 
Obayashi. 
</P>
<P>
	The original tender call had included a suggested median price  
of $87.8 million for the project.

<HEADLINE> Computer Problems Stall D.C. Subway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A computer that monitors every train in the  
Washington regional subway system failed today, halting service and 
delaying thousands of morning rush-hour commuters by up to 50 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're looking at the monitor you can clearly see where  
every train is in the Metrorail system, and because the screen 
either went blank or froze they weren't able to see that,'' said 
Cheryl Johnson, a spokeswoman for the Washington Area Metropolitan 
Transit Authority. 
</P>
<P>
	The failure forced Metro supervisors and maintenance personnel  
carrying two-way radios to spread out along the nearly 96 miles of 
track to monitor trains. 
</P>
<P>
	The system handles an estimated 383,000 passenger trips per day,  
including commuters from Northern Virginia, suburban Maryland, and 
the District of Columbia. It is also the preferred mode of 
transportation for tourists visiting the area's monuments and 
museums. 
</P>
<P>
	The 78 stations on the Metrorail system normally open at 5:30 in  
the morning. The problem delayed opening by a half hour.

<HEADLINE>  Ruth's Farewell Bat Sold at Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Babe Ruth's farewell bat hit a home run at the  
World Series of baseball auctions. 
</P>
<P>
	The bat Ruth leaned on during his farewell appearance at Yankee  
Stadium on June 13, 1948, was sold for $107,000 Thursday night at 
the opening session of a week-long auction of the world's largest 
private college of baseball memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
	The first 130 items were sold for a total of $2,073,763 at  
Sotheby's Auction House, far above the high estimate of $1,334,700. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am thrilled with tonight's sales results -- a perfect game,''  
said Barry Halper, the New Jersey businessman who is selling his 
collection. ``I look forward to the next fifteen sessions with 
anticipation and delight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The entire collection has been valued at between $7 million and  
$11 million, but some experts think the figure should be much 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think that's a bit conservative,'' said David Goodwillie,  
who heads the sports collectibles department at Sotheby's. ``We 
wouldn't be surprised if it reaches $15 million or more. So much of 
it is unique, pieces that have never been sold before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most prized piece at the opening session was a bat Ruth  
never actually used during a game. Ruth, who was dying of cancer, 
borrowed the bat from fellow Hall of Famer Bob Feller to use as a 
cane during the ceremony at Yankee Stadium. Ruth died two months 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	Two sports memorabilia dealers from Chicago, Dave Bushing and  
Don Knoll, bought the bat on behalf of an unidentified client. 
</P>
<P>
	Other notable sales Thursday:  
</P>
<P>
	-- $57,500 for a sheet of 15 autographs from every player who hit  
500 homers except Mark McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	-- $23,000 for an original ticket to the first World Series in  
1903. 
</P>
<P>
	-- $23,000 for Joe DiMaggio's last letter to Marilyn Monroe.  
</P>
<P>
	About 20 percent of Halper's collection was purchased by major  
league baseball for $6 million and is now housed at the Hall of 
Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. The remainder is to be auctioned by 
Sotheby's over the next week. 
</P>
<P>
	More accustomed to handling estate sales of art and furniture,  
the auction house needed two floors of its Manhattan building to 
house the Halper collection. 
</P>
<P>
	The whole operation is watched over by a larger-than-life wax  
figure of Babe Ruth, listed from $3,500 to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a framed display of canceled paychecks for the 1920  
Cincinnati Reds. Their most expensive player was Hall of Famer Edd 
Roush, who was getting a fancy $425 every two weeks. He batted 
.339, third in the National League, that season. 
</P>
<P>
	One customer, awed by the number of items on display, said of  
Halper, ``He must have a very understanding wife.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He'd have to just to accommodate the uniform jerseys that cover  
three walls at Sotheby's and rode on a dry cleaning rack in the 
basement of his home. 
</P>
<P>
	The jerseys include one from home run king Hank Aaron that's  
inscribed, ``I hit a few in this,'' and another identified as among 
those Pete Rose wore the night he broke Ty Cobb's hit record. If 
you prefer something straight from Cobb, his dentures are 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	In another corner are first baseman Bill Buckner's glove and  
cleats from the sixth game of the 1986 World Series. Buckner's 
10th-inning error enabled the New York Mets to beat Boston and the 
Mets went on to win the Series in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	The glove is accompanied by a card from Buckner to Halper which  
contains a misspelling. It says: ``To my pal, Barry. This glove has 
way to many holes in it. This is the glove I wore when I missed 
Mookie Wilson's ground ball in the sixth game. What a nightmare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also in the collection is Moe Berg's spy camera, which dates to  
a 1934 barnstorming trip through Japan when the mysterious catcher 
was taking reconnaissance pictures for the U.S. government that 
proved helpful when World War II began. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Ruth's Farewell Bat Sold at Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Babe Ruth's farewell bat hit a home run at the  
World Series of baseball auctions. 
</P>
<P>
	The bat Ruth leaned on during his farewell appearance at Yankee  
Stadium on June 13, 1948, was sold for $107,000 Thursday night at 
the opening session of a week-long auction of the world's largest 
private college of baseball memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
	The first 130 items were sold for a total of $2,073,763 at  
Sotheby's Auction House, far above the high estimate of $1,334,700. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am thrilled with tonight's sales results -- a perfect game,''  
said Barry Halper, the New Jersey businessman who is selling his 
collection. ``I look forward to the next fifteen sessions with 
anticipation and delight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The entire collection has been valued at between $7 million and  
$11 million, but some experts think the figure should be much 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think that's a bit conservative,'' said David Goodwillie,  
who heads the sports collectibles department at Sotheby's. ``We 
wouldn't be surprised if it reaches $15 million or more. So much of 
it is unique, pieces that have never been sold before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most prized piece at the opening session was a bat Ruth  
never actually used during a game. Ruth, who was dying of cancer, 
borrowed the bat from fellow Hall of Famer Bob Feller to use as a 
cane during the ceremony at Yankee Stadium. Ruth died two months 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	Two sports memorabilia dealers from Chicago, Dave Bushing and  
Don Knoll, bought the bat on behalf of an unidentified client. 
</P>
<P>
	Other notable sales Thursday:  
</P>
<P>
	-- $57,500 for a sheet of 15 autographs from every player who hit  
500 homers except Mark McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	-- $23,000 for an original ticket to the first World Series in  
1903. 
</P>
<P>
	-- $23,000 for Joe DiMaggio's last letter to Marilyn Monroe.  
</P>
<P>
	About 20 percent of Halper's collection was purchased by major  
league baseball for $6 million and is now housed at the Hall of 
Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. The remainder is to be auctioned by 
Sotheby's over the next week. 
</P>
<P>
	More accustomed to handling estate sales of art and furniture,  
the auction house needed two floors of its Manhattan building to 
house the Halper collection. 
</P>
<P>
	The whole operation is watched over by a larger-than-life wax  
figure of Babe Ruth, listed from $3,500 to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a framed display of canceled paychecks for the 1920  
Cincinnati Reds. Their most expensive player was Hall of Famer Edd 
Roush, who was getting a fancy $425 every two weeks. He batted 
.339, third in the National League, that season. 
</P>
<P>
	One customer, awed by the number of items on display, said of  
Halper, ``He must have a very understanding wife.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He'd have to just to accommodate the uniform jerseys that cover  
three walls at Sotheby's and rode on a dry cleaning rack in the 
basement of his home. 
</P>
<P>
	The jerseys include one from home run king Hank Aaron that's  
inscribed, ``I hit a few in this,'' and another identified as among 
those Pete Rose wore the night he broke Ty Cobb's hit record. If 
you prefer something straight from Cobb, his dentures are 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	In another corner are first baseman Bill Buckner's glove and  
cleats from the sixth game of the 1986 World Series. Buckner's 
10th-inning error enabled the New York Mets to beat Boston and the 
Mets went on to win the Series in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	The glove is accompanied by a card from Buckner to Halper which  
contains a misspelling. It says: ``To my pal, Barry. This glove has 
way to many holes in it. This is the glove I wore when I missed 
Mookie Wilson's ground ball in the sixth game. What a nightmare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also in the collection is Moe Berg's spy camera, which dates to  
a 1934 barnstorming trip through Japan when the mysterious catcher 
was taking reconnaissance pictures for the U.S. government that 
proved helpful when World War II began. 
</P>
<P>
	The most expensive item for sale is a collection of 16 World  
Series rings from former New York Yankees owner Del Webb, a 
co-owner of the team during its dynasty years of 1947-64. They are 
listed from $100,000 to $200,000 in the two-volume Sotheby's

<HEADLINE> Raiders' Stinchcomb Out for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALAMEDA, Calif. (AP) -- Offensive tackle Matt Stinchcomb, the  
Oakland Raiders' first-round draft pick this year, will have 
surgery on his separated left shoulder and miss his entire rookie 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Stinchcomb, who has been out since preseason, will have surgery  
within the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hung in there for a long time, Matt did and our staff did,  
trying to get as many opinions and as much research as we did 
before we made this decision,'' Raiders coach Jon Gruden said. 
``He's a bright young prospect. It's a disappointment to him and 
it's a disappointment to our squad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stinchcomb, who also had a problem with the shoulder at Georgia,  
was injured during training camp and aggravated the shoulder during 
an Aug. 31 preseason game against the San Francisco 49ers.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Rise Again as Stocks Tumble / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices crept higher Friday as stocks fell  
for a fourth straight day, leading more and more investors to seek 
shelter in less volatile fixed-income markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 9/32  
points, or $2.81 1/4 cents per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which 
moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.96 percent from 5.98 
percent late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market swoon has pushed the 30-year Treasury's yield  
below 6 percent for the first time in nearly four weeks. The last 
time the yield on the long-term Treasury was lower was Aug. 26, 
when it closed at 5.90 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors often flee to the relative safety of government-backed  
bonds when the stock market is unsettled. The Dow Jones industrial 
average has shed more than 1,000 points, or by more than 9 percent, 
since reaching a high of 11,326.04 on Aug. 26. The blue-chip 
average closed down 39.26 Friday at 10279.33. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were unchanged to up 1/16 point, while intermediate maturities rose 
3/32 to 7/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Friday, yields on three-month Treasury bills  
fell to 4.77 percent, as the discount fell 0.02 percentage point 
from Thursday to 4.65 percent. Six-month yields held at 5.01 
percent as the discount was unchanged at 4.82 percent. One-year 
yields slipped to 5.13 percent as the discount fell 0.03 percentage 
point to 4.87 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 5.25 percent from 5.31 percent late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose 7/8 to 113 13/32. The average yield to 
maturity of the index fell to 5.83 percent from 5.89 percent.

<HEADLINE> Ohio Mine Collapse Kills Two </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLARINGTON, Ohio (AP) -- The roof of a coal mine collapsed  
Friday, killing two miners and injuring several others who were 
working 700 feet underground. 
</P>
<P>
	The roof fell about 2 p.m. at the Consolidation Coal Co. mine,  
which was once one of the state's largest and is now in the process 
of being closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Hoffman, a vice president for parent company Consol Energy  
in Pittsburgh, said eight people were in the mine but only three 
were near the site of the accident. Monroe County Sheriff's Deputy 
Andrea Smith said nine workers in all were involved. 
</P>
<P>
	At least three miners had been taken to hospitals, including one  
who suffered severe shoulder injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The collapse affected a ``very small portion'' of the mine, said  
Tom Hoffman, a vice president for Consol Energy in Pittsburgh, the 
parent company of Consolidation Coal Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman said authorities had not determined what caused the  
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the collapse had not been determined.  
</P>
<P>
	Consol stopped mining coal in March, but has had small crew on  
duty since then to ship the remaining inventory and to close the 
mine. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-four people work at the mine, which was established in  
1971. 
</P>
<P>
	Clarington is in southeast Ohio, about 22 miles south of  
Wheeling, W.V.

<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Jerry Lawler, pro wrestler and candidate  
for mayor, was indicted Thursday on charges of running over an 
airport officer's foot after she wrote him a parking ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawler was charged with reckless endangerment, punishable by up  
to two years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Camille Pegues said she ticketed Lawler's vehicle in  
March because it was left unattended in a no-parking zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawler said the officer was nowhere near his van when he drove  
off.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Faces Harassment Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- Four years after Oregon Republican Bob  
Packwood was forced from the Senate due to allegations of sexual 
harassment, the issue has arisen again -- this time involving Sen. 
Max Baucus of Montana. 
</P>
<P>
	Christine Niedermeier, Baucus' chief of staff who was fired in  
August, today filed a formal sexual harassment complaint against 
her former boss in Congress, a source close to the case told The 
Associated Press on condition of anonymity. Niedermeier contends 
she was fired as retribution for shunning Baucus' sexual advances 
for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Baucus, a four-term Democrat, had said she was fired for her  
brutal management style that made work intolerable for the rest of 
his staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Baucus -- who in 1994, during the Packwood scandal stepped  
forward to endorse a bill that would make Congress subject to the 
same workplace laws as businesses -- has vehemently denied any 
sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me state, unequivocally, that I have never, under any  
circumstances, sexually harassed Christine Niedermeier,'' he said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Niedermeier, who is single, said Baucus never touched her  
improperly, but started hitting on her shortly after she went to 
work for him in May 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first I thought I was imagining things, because I have  
never been in a workplace before where I had been harassed,'' said 
Ms. Niedermeier, 47. ``It became more frequent. It took different 
forms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baucus, 57, and married to his second wife, would comment  
frequently on her appearance in front of others, constantly quiz 
her about her boyfriends, who she was dating and where she would go 
on dates, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	He asked her to take weekend trips together and compared her to  
his wife, Wanda, Ms. Niedermeier said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I gave him every possible signal I could to let him know I  
wasn't interested,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baucus has refused to comment on her specific examples.  
</P>
<P>
	Baucus said he fired Ms. Niedermeier when confronted with a  
revolt by staff fed up with her belittling and abusive treatment. 
He said a petition complaining about her was signed by 36 of 39 
staffers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I resigned because of Ms. Niedermeier,'' said Jan Metzmaker,  
former field director for one of Baucus' offices in Montana. ``It 
was way too stressful. It was too difficult to work for her and be 
sane and have a family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-eight female former Baucus employees signed a letter  
defending him as a ``man of highest integrity'' being subjected to 
``unwarranted personal attack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baucus said he gave Niedermeier several chances to improve her  
relations with the staff in Washington and Montana. But in the end, 
he said his only regret was that he did not fire her sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	Montana's senior senator said he supports the complaint system  
created in the wake of the Packwood scandal by the Congressional 
Accountability Act of 1995. He also said he welcomed the chance to 
defend himself in court. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because I have nothing to hide, I want this issue fully aired  
and resolved in a forum where Christine will be required to tell 
the truth,'' he said. ``If she believes that I sexually harassed 
her, then she should lay her case out on the table -- and under 
oath.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Niedermeier, a two-time congressional candidate in  
Connecticut, said she's willing to do that. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one would ever want to lie about this,'' she said. ``Why  
would I want to lie about something that would damage, if not 
destroy, my career?'' 
</P>
<P>
	If successful, Ms. Niedermeier could receive damages for lost  
wages and her old job back. If the case goes to court, she could 
also demand punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Going to court also would move the issue behind closed doors,  
because the administrative proceedings are confidential by law -- 
and they could take more than a year.

<HEADLINE> Rooney Explains Column </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Andy Rooney has taken steps to clear up a little  
wreck of his own. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``60 Minutes'' curmudgeon set tongues wagging with a  
newspaper column this week that suggested that the most beautiful 
woman in TV news ``looks as if she had been in a minor automobile 
accident'' because of plastic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't name any names. That's because, Rooney said Thursday,  
he wasn't talking about anybody. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was writing metaphorically,'' he said. ``I didn't have  
anybody really in mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his column about aging, Rooney said that most people are more  
attractive if they look their age instead of synthetically trying 
to improve their appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	That's something many people in his business can't accept, he  
noted. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the most beautiful -- OK, THE most beautiful -- woman in  
television news had a job done on herself a few years ago and, 
while she doesn't look bad, she does not look the same or as good 
to me as when she had what must have seemed to her to be 
shortcomings,'' he wrote. ``She looks as if she had been in a minor 
automobile accident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gossip columnists -- and undoubtedly a few of Rooney's female  
colleagues -- immediately began the guessing game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suppose there must be 20 women in television who thought I  
was talking about them,'' Rooney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some speculated Rooney meant Diane Sawyer, his former colleague  
on ``60 Minutes.'' Not so fast, the New York Post's Page Six opined 
on Thursday, tossing the names Barbara Walters, Christiane 
Amanpour, Maria Shriver, Jane Pauley, Lesley Stahl and Connie Chung 
into the mix. 
</P>
<P>
	Yikes!  
</P>
<P>
	With so many women to potentially offend, Rooney put a stop to  
it. He said he regretted writing it: ``I didn't mean to call this 
much attention to myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he offered a verbal bouquet to Ms. Sawyer.  
</P>
<P>
	``Diane is a good friend of mine and I like her a lot,'' he  
said. ``I think she's not only one of the great people in 
television but she's one of the good people, too. She's as smart as 
she is beautiful.''

<HEADLINE> Reggie Jackson May Join Angels Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Since his group's attempt to buy the Oakland  
Athletics stalled, Reggie Jackson may try to become involved in the 
purchase of another of his former teams, the Anaheim Angels. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson reportedly has discussed joining billionaires Henry  
Nicholas III and Henry Samueli in an attempt to buy the Angels from 
the Walt Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know Nicholas and Samueli and we have had a short visit,''  
Jackson told The Los Angeles Times. ``I'd certainly be interested, 
but there is nothing concrete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who played five seasons for the Angels, also might  
consider a front office position with the club if he teams up with 
Nicholas and Samueli, who co-founded the Irvine, Calif.-based 
Broadcom Corp. semiconductor group. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney spokeswoman Chris Castro declined to comment on the  
report Friday. Calls to Broadcom, Jackson's office and his agent's 
office were not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Nicholas, Samueli and a small group of other  
investors reportedly were close to a signing a letter of intent to 
buy the Angels and the NHL's Mighty Ducks from Disney for between 
$400 million and $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Tavares, president of Disney subsidiary Anaheim Sports  
Inc., later acknowledged only that Disney had been approached by 
potential buyers and that the company was in ``a listening mode.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Any deal involving the Angels would need the approval of Major  
League Baseball. Tavares said last week that talks weren't at the 
stage where the team would seek permission from the commissioner's 
office to share its financial information with possible investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson was on five World Series champions during a career that  
included stints with the Angels, Oakland, the New York Yankees and 
Baltimore. He was known as ``Mr. October,'' hitting .357 with 10 
home runs and 24 RBIs in 27 World Series games. 
</P>
<P>
	He is currently director of new business alliances for Viking  
Components, a Rancho Santa Margarita, Calif.-based computer 
equipment company. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort to buy the Athletics was shelved recently by major  
league owners, pending a report of a committee studying the sport's 
economic problems.
