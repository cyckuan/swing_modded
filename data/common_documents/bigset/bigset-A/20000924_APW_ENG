<HEADLINE> Snow Shuts Down Interstate 80  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   RAWLINS, Wyo. (AP) -- Thousands of stranded motorists
sought
shelter as a snowstorm shut down 200 miles of Interstate 80 and
caused a 12-car pileup east of Laramie on Saturday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Interstate 80 was closed between Rock Springs and Cheyenne for a
second day after cars slid and crashed on the icy asphalt.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels quickly filled with travelers waiting for the interstate
to reopen. The American Red Cross expected 2,600 people in two
shelters in Rawlins and 200 people at a shelter in Rock Springs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were on our way back from a vacation in Yellowstone and we
got kind of caught by surprise here,'' said Robert Eves, 40, of
Erie, Ill., who was with his wife and 2-year-old son at a Rawlins
shelter and expected to end up in a sleeping bag on the floor
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The family had been forced to stay at a shelter in Wamsutter on
Friday because of an interstate closure, and had gotten only 40
miles before the interstate was closed again.
</P>
<P>
   The storm draped a swath of snow up to 15 inches deep from
Encampment to Casper before heading southwest into Colorado late
Saturday night. It was expected to taper off by Sunday, leaving
behind temperatures in the 50s and 60s on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The worst of the accumulations is probably over,'' said
meteorologist Mike Weiland of the National Weather Service in
Cheyenne.
</P>
<P>
   That was little comfort to the owners of hundreds of
tractor-trailers, campers and cars that lined the interstate and
Rawlins neighborhood streets Saturday evening. Truck drivers were
asked to not park their rigs close together to avoid carbon
monoxide problems, said Brady Fox of the American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 people who had been in Rawlins shelters Friday night
swamped Interstate 80 when it reopened briefly. The interstate had
been shut down Friday from Laramie to Rawlins and closed all the
way to the Utah line early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A 12-car pileup east of Laramie was part of the reason for
Saturday's closure. Two tractor-trailers crashed in the area, and
other motorists were injured, but there was no word on how
extensively, a Wyoming Highway Patrol dispatcher said.
</P>
<P>
   The closure came as football fans were traveling to Laramie for
an evening game between Wyoming and Nevada. Football players were
also stuck in traffic, delaying the 7 p.m. kickoff by an hour.

<HEADLINE> No. 10 Mich. 35, No. 19 Ill. 31  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN KELLY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) -- Anthony Thomas scored on a 3-yard run
with less than 2:30 left as No. 10 Michigan took advantage of two
late fumbles to beat No. 19 Illinois 35-31 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the touchdown, Thomas appeared to fumble near the
goal line, but officials ruled he was down. A replay appeared to
show otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolverines, who blew a 20-point second half lead to Illinois
last season, rallied from a 21-7 deficit in the third quarter
behind Drew Henson.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were up and we didn't come out and do what we needed to do
in the fourth quarter,'' Illini quarterback Kurt Kittner said.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois lost two of its three fumbles, including one of its
last drive.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of things we could have done better so I'm not
going to put it on that (fumbles), Obviously, protecting the
football is one of them,'' said Ron Turner.
</P>
<P>
   After missing the first three games with a broken right foot,
Henson replaced an ineffective John Navarre at quarterback late in
the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas rushed for 228 yards and two touchdowns to help the
Wolverines (3-1, 1-0 Big Ten) avoid a repeat of last week's close
loss at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois' final drive ended when Jameel Cook fumbled near
midfield. The Illini (3-1, 0-1) missed a chance at the program's
best start since 1951.
</P>
<P>
   The Illini seemed to contain Michigan on the Wolverines' first
drive, but were fooled by a fake punt. Halfback Walter Cross
grabbed the snap and squirted untouched through the line.
</P>
<P>
   Cross ran 41 yards before the stunned Illini caught him at the
18. Four plays later, Thomas scored on a 2-yard draw.
</P>
<P>
   The momentum swung on two punts. Illinois' Steve Fitts pinned
Michigan at its own 2. When the Wolverines' drive faltered, punter
Hayden Epstein bobbled a low snap in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   He scrambled and tried to kick, but instead sent the ball
floating sideways and Illinois batted it out of bounds at the 3.
Antoineo Harris ran it in on the next play.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the half, Aaron Moorehead broke free and caught
Kittner's pass for a 58-yard touchdown play.
</P>
<P>
   With Illinois leading 14-7 and 1:42 left, Michigan Lloyd Carr
switched quarterbacks, replacing Navarre with Henson.
</P>
<P>
   Henson exploited Illinois' prevent defense to move the
Wolverines into field-goal range with 14 seconds to go in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Epstein, who missed a late 24-yard field goal last week in
Michigan's 23-20 loss at UCLA, missed the 32-yarder wide left.
</P>
<P>
   Kittner drove the Illini 65 yards on the opening series of the
second half, hitting tight end Josh Whitman with a 15-yard TD pass.
</P>
<P>
   Henson and David Terrell, held to two catches for 12 yards in
the first half, teamed up on the next drive.
</P>
<P>
   On fourth-and-inches near midfield, Henson dove over the top for
the first down. Then he went deep to Terrell, who jumped so high to
make the catch that he landed flat on his back at the Illinois 11.
Henson scored on an 8-yard scramble.
</P>
<P>
   Kittner answered, connecting on several key passes during a
76-yard drive that ended with a 24-yard field goal by Fitts that
put Illinois up 24-14 with 22 seconds left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   On the second play of the fourth quarter, Henson hit Terrell
with a 57-yard touchdown pass to get Michigan within three.
</P>
<P>
   On the next drive, Kittner twice hit Greg Lewis on passes longer
than 20 yards to set up a 17-yard touchdown throw to Eric McGoey
that made it 31-21.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Perry scored on a 15-yard run to bring Michigan close
again, 31-28, with 9:29 to go.
</P>
<P>
   With less than five minutes to go, Illinois stopped Michigan on
a key third-and-6 at the Illini 42, forcing a punt. Michigan lined
up as if it was going for it, but Henson punted into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at its 20, Illinois couldn't run out the clock. On a
third-and-6, Rocky Harvey tried for extra yardage and fumbled.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan took over at the Illinois 26. Two plays later, Thomas
ran for 17 yards, but appeared to fumble near the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois recovered, but the officials ruled Thomas was down.
Thomas then scored the game-winner.

<HEADLINE> Navarro, Williams Advance in Boxing  </HEADLINE>
By ED SCHUYLER JR.
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Jose Navarro boxed his way into the
Olympic flyweight quarterfinals, and this time his father saw it.
</P>
<P>
   With his father and older brother Carlos Jr., cheering him on,
the 19-year-old Navarro scored half of his 12 points in the fourth
round for a 12-9 decision over Hicham Mesbahi of Morocco at 112
pounds Sunday afternoon (Monday EDT).
</P>
<P>
   When the decision was announced, Mesbahi threw up his hands,
fell to his knees and pounded the canvas. There were boos.
</P>
<P>
   Navarro's father had missed his son's opening-round win because
he missed a plane in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Dad almost saw his son eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   After building a 5-2 lead in the second round, Navarro had
trouble solving Mesbahi's defense and he trailed 7-6 after three
rounds.
</P>
<P>
   After the third round, Navarro said he looked at his father and
''My dad put his hands up and said in Spanish, 'This is it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Navarro became the sixth U.S. boxer to advance to the
quarterfinals. He will box Jerome Thomas of France on Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Navarro's win, Ricardo Williams Jr. of Cincinnati
became quarterfinalist No. 7.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-year-old Williams, boxing with a picture of his
7-month-old son taped to his left boxing boot, stoppd Olusegun
Ajose of Nigeria on the 15-point rule (21-6) at 139 pounds. It was
the second 15-point-rule victory for Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Olanda Anderson, an Army sergeant stationed at Fort Carson,
Colo., was to box at 178 pounds later in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew I was behind by one point in the last round and I had
no choice but to go out there and just throw,'' Navarro said. ''I
knew I had to step it up a lot. It's just an experience for me. I'm
going to learn a lot from this fight, as I do from every fight.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 139-pound bout, Ajose drew applause when he did a little
showboating, but it was Williams who had the fun.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're supposed to have fun, it's a sport,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Ajose got the crowd on his side in the fourth round when he
scored three points to cut Williams lead to 16-6. The left-handed
Williams then unleashed five scoring blows to the head and ended
the fight with 40 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ''It gets more exciting as it goes on,'' said Williams, who will
box Alexandre Leonov of Russian on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Two of three Americans who boxed Saturday night advanced.
</P>
<P>
   Rocky Juarez, the 125-pound world champion from Houston,
outpointed Falk Huste of Germany 17-15 and set up a quarterfinal
showdown on Wednesday against Somluck Kamsing of Thailand, the 1996
Olympic gold medalist. Kamsing beat Tulkunbay Turgunov of Ubekistan
6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Jermain Taylor of Little Rock, Ark., pounded out a 23-9 decision
over Scott McIntosh of Canada at 156 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Then super heavyweight Calvin Brock of Charlotte, N.C., became
the fourth U.S. boxer to lose. He took a standing 8-count, was
knocked down and stopped in the fourth round on the 15-point rule
(21-5) by Paolo Vidoz of Italy, a bronze medalist at the 1999 world
championships.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year-old Juarez, who beat Huste 12-6 in the quarterfinals
at the world championships last year in Houston, clinched his
victory this time with a scoring blow late in the fourth round for
a 17-14 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Four times during the fast-paced four rounds Juarez led by three
points, but never for very long. Each boxer got a couple of points
for body blows. In some bouts judges have ignored punches to the
body.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old Taylor clinched his match against McIntosh by
outscoring the Canadian 11-3 in the third round. He will box Adnan
Catic of Germany in the quarterfinals on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Brock was simply outclassed in the last two rounds. After a 2-2
first round, Brock fell behind 6-3 after two rounds. Then he took a
battering in the third round when he took a standing 8-count, and
he was knocked down with a body punch in the fourth. The fight was
stopped in the closing seconds.

<HEADLINE> Sydney's a Tough Place To Sail  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Shifty, light breezes made way for
steady wind on Sydney Harbor, carrying an Italian to the women's
windsurfing gold medal and providing for some crisp Soling match
races near the Sydney Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Soling skipper Jeff Madrigali of Novato, Calif., wasn't
able to capitalize, though, and quickly got into trouble as he lost
his first two match races in the second round robin on Sunday
(Saturday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   Madrigali, the 1996 bronze medalist, was edged by Australia's
Neville Wittey in wind that gusted to 15 knots, the strongest so
far in the regatta.
</P>
<P>
   Wittey, cheered on by fellow Aussies on shore and in spectator
boats, led at all five turning marks on the windward-leeward course
and beat Madrigali by less than a boat length.
</P>
<P>
   Madrigali then lost to Denmark's Jesper Bank, the 1992 gold
medalist and '88 bronze medalist. With the course shortened to two
windward-leeward laps, Bank led at all three marks and won by about
six lengths.
</P>
<P>
   Madrigali, the reigning world champion, had three more match
races to go. He earned a bye in the first round robin by finishing
fourth in the fleet racing.
</P>
<P>
   The three crews surviving this round robin are to join the top
three from the fleet racing in the quarterfinals. The medals will
be decided on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Watching from the U.S. chase boat on the blustery afternoon was
Russell Coutts, who skippered New Zealand to two straight sweeps in
the America's Cup. He is serving as Madrigali's coach and tuning
partner. Coutts, who recently accepted a big-money offer to skipper
a Swiss boat in the next America's Cup, won an Olympic gold medal
in the Finn class in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Madrigali's crewmembers in the 26-foot boat are Craig Healy of
Tiburon, Calif., and Hartwell Jordan of Discovery Bay, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Italy's Alessandra Sensini won the 11th and final windsurfing
fleet race by seven seconds over Amelie Lux of Germany. Sensini and
Lux tied with 15 points, but Sensini won the gold medal based on
five fleet-race victories to three for Lux. Sensini won the bronze
medal in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand's Barbara Kendall won the bronze, completing a set
of Olympic medals. She won the gold in 1992 and silver in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Sensini, Lux and Kendall combined to win all 11 races. Lanee
Butler of Aliso Viejo, Calif., was fourth, her best finish in three
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, Roland Gaebler and Rene Schwall of Germany won the
bronze medal in the Tornado class. Roman Hagara and Hans Peter
Steinacher of Austria clinched the gold on Friday and Darren
Bundock and John Forbes of Australia earned the silver on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The American crew, John Lovell of New Orleans and Charlie
Ogletree of Newport Beach, Calif., finished seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Until Sunday, the wind on Sydney Harbor had been as patchy as a
hobo's jeans and as tricky as a convention of pickpockets.
</P>
<P>
   It's tough to sail here, and brothers Jonathan and Charlie McKee
of Seattle found that out the tough way as they lost what had been
an excellent chance to win the first Olympic gold medal in the 49er
class.
</P>
<P>
   The McKees still have a shot at silver or bronze, but it was the
Finnish crew of Thomas Johanson and Jyrki Jarvi that clinched the
gold medal with a practically perfect showing on Saturday (Friday
night EDT). They had finishes of third, first and second to earn
the gold with one fleet race to sail.
</P>
<P>
   The McKees had their worst day of the regatta aboard their
winged skiff, with finishes of seventh, sixth and 11th.
</P>
<P>
   The other medals will be decided Monday. The McKees, both former
Olympic medalists, and Britain and Spain still have chances.
</P>
<P>
   Two other American skippers who sailed their first races of the
Olympics on Saturday are finding out how hard it's going to be to
medal here.
</P>
<P>
   Finn skipper Russ Silvestri of Tiburon, Calif., finished third,
then 18th in the first two fleet races, and is eighth overall.
</P>
<P>
   Star sailor Mark Reynolds of San Diego, in his fourth straight
Olympics, did it the other way around, taking a 14th, then a third,
for 10th place.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was very variable,'' Silvestri said, putting his own twist
on the conditions on the Pacific Ocean just off the Sydney Heads.
''It was very tricky. Everyone all week's been telling me how
tricky it's been, and I'm like, 'Yeah, yeah, yeah; sure, sure,
sure.' Now I believe them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Finns and Stars had a reserve day Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Missing Cruise Ship Passenger Found  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KETCHIKAN, Alaska (AP) -- A cruise ship passenger who officials
feared had fallen overboard was located Saturday, alive and well at
her home in suburban Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska State troopers in Ketchikan called the Coast Guard in
Juneau to say the woman, Sherry Caminita, 73, had been found.
</P>
<P>
   Caminita, reached Saturday night at her home in St. Clair
Shores, Mich., told The Associated Press that she cut short her
cruise because of a disagreement with a traveling companion.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know, she's telling me what to wear, and I thought, 'I
don't think so,' so I just left,'' Caminita said. ''I just got sick
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   She apparently got off while the Dawn Princess was docked in
Juneau on Friday, carrying just her purse and leaving all her
belongings on board, said Randy Holloway, the Coast Guard's search
and rescue coordinator in Juneau.
</P>
<P>
   Caminita said she didn't remember where she caught the plane to
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The ship's captain had alerted the Coast Guard on Saturday
morning that the woman had not been seen since Friday afternoon. An
employee assigned to clean the woman's cabin found her bed had not
been slept in.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard had sent two boats and a helicopter out in heavy
fog to retrace the cruise ship's path along a 225 mile stretch of
water between Juneau and Ketchikan before officials were notified
that the woman had been found.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the ship's crew had checked the ship's
computerized system that notes each time a passenger or crew member
boards or departs the ship, but found no evidence that Caminita had
left in Juneau.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Lazio campaigns appear to agree on soft money ban  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Rep. Rick Lazio and Hillary Rodham Clinton
appeared to have reached a deal late Saturday banning the use of
so-called soft money advertising from the New York Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the two sides have come to a close enough point that
we effectively have a deal,'' said Clinton's campaign manager, Bill
de Blasio.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio told reporters, ''It appears that we have an agreement,
based on what I am hearing what Mrs. Clinton said.''
</P>
<P>
   Soft money refers to the unlimited funds collected by political
parties. While hard money contributions, limited to $2,000 per
donor, can be used for ads that advocate voting for or against a
candidate, soft money can only be used to advocate an issue, boost
a candidate or attack a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The verbal agreements came after a day of public back-and-forth,
and about a week and a half after Lazio sprung his version of a
soft money ban on Clinton during their first televised debate and
demanded she sign it on the spot. Clinton refused and later called
Lazio's action a stunt.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Saturday that the Democratic party had agreed to
stop running ads on her behalf if Republicans promised to cease
paying for commercials boosting Lazio. She said she would urge
independent groups who support her to refrain from running radio
and television commercials and asked that Lazio do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said he had secured promises from Republicans in New York
and Washington to stop spending money on ads for him. He said he
hoped soft money ads would be off the air by Monday, Clinton said
the Democrats would stop running their commercials on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Any violation of the agreement would result in a proportionate
response - if a group on one side released a $100,000 ad, the other
side could respond with a $100,000 ad of their own, de Blasio said.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative agreement appeared to cover spending by political
parties but not by outside organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Lazio both emphasized that any agreement would cover
only soft money spending for radio and TV commercials, not direct
mail or get-out-the-vote efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's focus on what we know we can hear and see,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Should soft money be banned, Lazio could have an advantage: The
latest federal filings showed his campaign had more hard money than
Clinton's, $10.2 million to $7.1 million.

<HEADLINE> No. 18 TCU 52, Arkansas St. 3  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- TCU can throw the football, too.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Printers threw for three touchdowns and 204 yards,
including a 74-yarder to LaTarence Dunbar, and No. 18 TCU (3-0)
routed Arkansas State 52-3 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   On a night LaDainian Tomlinson, the nation's leading rusher, ran
for 140 yards and two TDs, the passing game showed it is alive and
well.
</P>
<P>
   ''Defenses are going to have to respect our passing game,''
Tomlinson said. ''It'll make it a little easier for the running
game down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Printers: ''They were just giving us the pass tonight, so
we had no choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson, the Horned Frogs' Heisman Trophy hopeful, had 125
yards at halftime and didn't play much in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson and Printers helped the Horned Frogs score on all but
two of their offensive possessions in the first three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   TCU has now won eight straight games, its longest winning streak
since 1938 -- the last year it won a national championship. Arkansas
State is 0-4.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson opened the scoring nearly six minutes into the first
quarter, streaking down through the heart of the Arkansas State
defense for a 64-yard touchdown run.
</P>
<P>
   He also added a 1-yard touchdown run later in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas State struggled on offense all evening, except for a
20-play, 78-yard drive that took almost nine minutes off the clock
in the second quarter. But the drive stalled at the TCU 2, and the
Indians had to settle for a 19-yard field goal by Nick Gatto.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our guys kept battling and kept them out of the end zone,''
said TCU coach Dennis Franchione. ''When you've got the kind of
defense we have, you can be offensively patient.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU was able to score 10 points in the final 1:29 of the first
half. Printers found Dunbar open in the corner of the end zone on a
1-yard TD pass to push TCU's lead to 28-3.
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar finished the game with four catches for 91 yards.
</P>
<P>
   On the ensuing possession, Arkansas State quarterback Cleo Lemon
fumbled after being sacked by TCU defensive end Joe Hill at the
Arkansas State 19. TCU's Robert Pollard recovered the fumble.
</P>
<P>
   Four plays later, Chris Kaylakie kicked a 39-yard field goal
with two seconds left on the clock, giving the Horned Frogs a 31-3
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not to take anything away from TCU, but at times we were our
own worst enemy,'' said Arkansas State coach Joe Hollis. ''The ball
game got completely out of hand at the end of the first half.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians' passing attack was limited with the absence of
leading receiver Robert Kilow. Lemon finished 8-of-17 for 65 yards,
and was sacked four times -- twice by TCU defensive end Aaron
Schobel.
</P>
<P>
   The Horned Frogs finished with 466 yards of offense. Arkansas
State only crossed midfield twice in the game and finished with 151
yards.

<HEADLINE> Khorkina Scratches From Vault  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Sveltana Khorkina isn't taking any more
chances with the vault.
</P>
<P>
   Citing personal reasons, the Russian withdrew from the Olympic
vault finals about a half-hour before competition began Sunday. She
fell on a vault that was nearly two inches shorter than it was
supposed to be during Thursday's all-around final, possibly costing
her the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   Khorkina still planned to compete on the uneven bars, where she
is the reigning Olympic, world and European champion. She also is
scheduled to compete on the floor Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   When equipment workers adjusted the vault for the women's
competition, they set it 1.97 inches shorter than regulation. The
first 18 gymnasts in the all-around vaulted before the problem was
discovered, and there was a series of spectacular crashes.
</P>
<P>
   But no one was affected as much as the 5-foot-5 Khorkina. The
favorite for the gold got no height on her first vault and landed
smack on her knees on the first jump.
</P>
<P>
   She nailed her second, but her combined score was only a 9.363,
bad enough to knock her out of the running and throw her into a
snit for the rest of the night.
</P>
<P>
   The first 18 gymnasts were allowed to redo their vaults, but
Khorkina had already fallen on the uneven bars and knew a do-over
wasn't going to get her a medal. She finished 11th overall.

<HEADLINE> Remnants of Helene Soak Southeast  </HEADLINE>
By DAN LEWERENZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- The remnants of Tropical Storm Helene spun
across the Southeast on Saturday after dumping heavy rain in the
Carolinas and killing a man asleep in a trailer. Meanwhile,
Tropical Storm Isaac grew to hurricane strength deep in the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Isaac's winds reached 120 mph Saturday, but with its eye about
1,700 miles east of the Lesser Antilles, forecasters said it posed
no immediate threat to land.
</P>
<P>
   Helene came ashore early Friday in Fort Walton Beach, Fla., and
dissipated as it quickly moved up the Eastern Seaboard. By midday
Saturday, it had moved off the Outer Banks.
</P>
<P>
   The storm was blamed for one death and at least six injuries in
Allendale County, about 80 miles south of Columbia, said South
Carolina Emergency Preparedness Division spokesman Joe Farmer.
</P>
<P>
   John Thomas Kendrick, 68, was killed in Martin, S.C., when a
trailer where he was sleeping was picked up by wind, said Allendale
County Coroner Elaine Poston. About a dozen other homes in the area
were also damaged, and the National Weather Service was checking
reports of a tornado.
</P>
<P>
   Several communities in the Carolinas reported flooding in
low-lying areas. Brunswick and New Hanover counties in North
Carolina recorded 6 to 7 inches of rain, and Orangeburg, S.C.,
received more than 5 1/3 inches, according to the National Weather
Service.

<HEADLINE> Gay Athletes Said Hiding Sexuality  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Gay Olympic athletes hide their sexual
preference for fear it could affect their chances to compete or
attract sponsorship, a Sydney 2002 Gay Games official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Garrie Gibson estimated there are more than 1,000 gay men and
lesbian athletes competing at the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the vast majority of them, their sexuality is something
that they have had to hide, to keep hidden because they did not
want their sexuality to be an issue in competing in sports,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''(They) don't come out about their sexuality because of the
fact that it can have an impact on their opportunities to compete
or on their opportunities to attract sponsorship.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Waddell, a decathlete who competed for the United States in
the 1968 Olympics, founded the Gay Games in 1981. He died of AIDS
in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Former tennis player Martina Navratilova is a patron of the Gay
Games, while four-time Olympic gold medalist Greg Louganis has done
diving exhibitions at previous Gay Games. Both Navratilova and
Louganis have disclosed they are gay.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson said there had been many inquiries in the past week about
the Gay Games and was confident they will attract ''quite a few''
elite athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 31 official sports are a number unique to the Gay
Games, including powerlifting and physique.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of sports at our event which are mainstream but
there are a couple that are very much targeted at the gay and
lesbian community and physique is one of them,'' Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   Powerlifting -- a limited form of weightlifting -- and physique
were the only two sports subjected to drug testing, he said.

Finance Ministers Discuss Oil, Debt

<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- The world's richest nations signaled Saturday
they would intervene in foreign exchange markets if necessary again to help
Europe's ailing currency -- but they ruled out the idea of pushing oil prices
lower through a tax cut. After staging Friday's surprise concerted strike to
bolster the euro, which fell this week to record lows against the U.S. dollar,
the so-called Group of Seven industrial countries said they would keep an eye on
the euro and ''cooperate in exchange markets as appropriate.''

Montenegro regardless of the outcome. The government-run election commission
then announced that voters in Sunday's presidential, parliamentary and local
election must show their marked ballots to electoral officials before placing

   RAWLINS, Wyo. (AP) -- Thousands of stranded motorists sought shelter as a
snowstorm shut down 200 miles of Interstate 80 and caused a 12-car pileup east
of Laramie on Saturday. Interstate 80 was closed between Rock Springs and
Cheyenne for a second day after cars slid and crashed on the icy asphalt. Hotels
quickly filled with travelers waiting for the interstate to reopen. The American
Red Cross expected 2,600 people in two shelters in Rawlins and 200 people at a

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Zuzana Zirkova scored 18 points and
Slovakia beat Senegal 68-32 to keep alive its chances of reaching
the quarterfinals in its first women's Olympic basketball
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Slovakia (2-3) will finish fourth in its pool if Brazil beats
Canada later Sunday (Saturday night EDT). If Canada wins, Slovakia,
Brazil and Canada will finish in a three-way tie with two advancing
on goal average (points for in games among those teams divided by
points allowed).
</P>
<P>
   Zirkova had 12 points at halftime as Slovakia took a 27-12 lead.
Slovakia scored the first 12 points of the second half and led by
as much as 53-16 with about 12 minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   Astou Ndiaye had 16 points and 10 rebounds for Senegal (0-5),
which is also making its first Olympic appearance. Senegal, which
lost its preliminary round games by an average of 36.8 points, will
play New Zealand (0-5) for 11th place on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Russia 92, New Zealand 54
</P>
<P>
   Irina Rutkovskaya scored 18 points to lead Russia (3-2), which
had already secured a berth in the quarterfinals. Whether it
finished second, third or fourth depended on the outcome of
Sunday's later games.
</P>
<P>
   Russia pulled away from the game's final tie with a 9-0 run that
made it 25-19 with 5:27 left in the first half. Rutkovskaya scored
the first six points of the run, all on free throws, and that
ignited the offense as Russia went on to a 41-28 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Russia entered the game shooting 50.9 percent from the field and
it improved on that, going 33-for-61 (54.1 percent), including
8-for-17 from 3-point range with Rutkovskaya making all three of
her attempts from beyond the arc.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Ofsoski had 11 points to lead New Zealand, which was
outscored by an average of 34 points in the preliminary round of
its first Olympic appearance.
</P>
<P>
South Korea 69, Cuba 56
</P>
<P>
   Chun Joo-weon's triple-double -- 10 points, 10 rebounds and 11
assists -- helped South Korea (3-2) clinch a berth in the
quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea, which led 34-28 at halftime despite going just
2-for-10 from 3-point range, found its shooting touch in the second
half, making five of 11 3-point attempts while using the shot clock
to its advantage against a bigger and more physical opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Yang Jung-ok, who had 17 points, made four of her first five
3-point attempts in the second half, the middle two in a 10-0 run
that gave South Korea a 52-42 lead with 11:22 to play.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea went four minutes without scoring late in the second
half but its lead never got below nine points as it ran the shot
clock down on each possession. Cuba didn't convert at the other
end, shooting 33 percent in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Liset Castillo had 17 points for Cuba (1-4), which failed to
reach the quarterfinals for the first time in its four Olympic
appearances. Cuba will play for ninth place.

<HEADLINE> North, S. Koreas Discuss Investment  </HEADLINE>
By SANG-HUN CHOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korean officials arrived in
Seoul on Sunday to discuss ways of boosting badly needed South
Korean investment in their impoverished, communist country, in the
latest in a series of signs of improving relations on the divided
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   The North's delegation, led by senior trade official Jong Un Up,
will meet for two days starting Monday in the South Korean capital
with a team from the South headed by Assistant Finance and Economy
Minister Lee Keun-kyong.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides will discuss agreements to avoid double taxation
for South Korean companies operating in the communist North and
mechanisms to protect their investments.
</P>
<P>
   They will also discuss establishing direct bank transactions
between the two Koreas and a mechanism for settling future business
disputes, said a news release from Seoul's Finance and Economy
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Such agreements are needed to encourage businesses in the South
to invest in North Korea, which is ruled by a Stalinist regime
often described as unpredictable by Western officials, Seoul
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Jong's 15-member North Korean delegation, which included
journalists, arrived in Seoul through China.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean President Kim Dae-jung has said his government will
help bring more outside investment to North Korea to help rebuild
its economy once Pyongyang agrees to ease tensions on the
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   But except for a $942 million tourism project run by South
Korea's Hyundai conglomerate, the South's investments in the North
have largely been limited to small-scale joint ventures repairing
cars and producing garments, shoes and bottled water.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kim Il Chul, minister of the North's People's Army,
was expected to travel to Seoul across the heavily guarded border
and fly to the southern resort island of Cheju later Sunday to
start the first-ever defense ministers' talk with the South on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The two Koreas agreed to work together for reconciliation during
their historic summit in June.
</P>
<P>
   They have since stopped propaganda broadcasts, opened government
dialogue and began rebuilding a cross-border train line.
</P>
<P>
   In August, 100 people from each side crossed the border for four
days of temporary reunions with families they had not seen for five
decades following the 1950-53 Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Red Cross officials from South and North Korea
agreed to hold two more such reunions on Nov. 2-4 and Dec. 5-7
respectively. Each reunion will involve 100 people from each side.
</P>
<P>
   They also agreed to allow 300 people from each side to start
exchanging letters with their long-lost kin in November.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean Peninsula was divided into communist North Korea and
pro-Western South Korea at the end of World War II in 1945. Their
war ended without a peace treaty and their border remains the
world's most heavily fortified.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Now Alexei Nemov has a medal of every
color.
</P>
<P>
   The men's all-around champion won the silver medal in the floor
exercise Sunday. He also has a bronze from the team competition.
</P>
<P>
   Igors Vihrovs of Latvia won the gold. Jordan Jovtchev of
Bulgaria took the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   When Vihrovs finished his routine, he ran off the podium pumping
his fists as the crowd cheered. He then stood next to Nemov, pacing
nervously as he waited for his score.
</P>
<P>
   When his 9.812 was posted, putting Vihrovs in first place, he
jumped up and down, throwing his arms in the air in triumph. Nemov
applauded and gave Vihrovs a congratulatory hug.
</P>
<P>
   The United States' medals drought in gymnastics continued.
Morgan Hamm, who was celebrating his 18th birthday Sunday with twin
brother, Paul, finished eighth out of the nine competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan looked solid throughout his routine. While almost
everyone else had little hops on their landings, he was solid. He
performed his flares with ease, scissor-kicking his legs around as
he turned his body on his hands.
</P>
<P>
   But with about three seconds to go, Morgan faltered. After
whipping himself across the floor on aerial back handsprings, he
took a big bounce forward on his landing and had to put his hands
down to keep himself from falling.
</P>
<P>
   He scored a 9.262.
</P>
<P>
   Marian Dragulescu, who won the floor exercise at the world
championships, couldn't hold the landing on his final tumbling
pass. He took a big step back with his left foot to steady himself,
but the error was costly.
</P>
<P>
   He scored a 9.712, not good enough for a medal, good enough only
for sixth place.

<HEADLINE> Vedder, Nader Rally In Seattle  </HEADLINE>
By GENE JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- It was grunge and green together.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Vedder, front man for Seattle ''grunge rock'' supergroup
Pearl Jam, rallied the faithful Saturday night in support of Green
Party Presidential candidate Ralph Nader, who repeated his call to
be included in upcoming presidential debates.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never been to one of these. I think the reason why is
I've never had anyone I could believe in before,'' Vedder told the
crowd of several thousand who paid $10 each to attend the rally at
Key Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Vedder, accompanying himself on acoustic guitar, warmed up the
crowd with two songs whose lyrics took jabs at the kind of
corporate leaders Nader has made a career of skewering.
</P>
<P>
   Vedder dedicated his first song to ''my neighbors Paul and Bill.
Are they here somewhere? Maybe in a skybox? If they're not here,
they should be.''
</P>
<P>
   The reference was to Microsoft Corp. co-founders Paul Allen and
Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Nader slammed what he called the unacceptable inequality of
wealth in the United States, asserting that recently Gates' wealth
equaled the worth of the 120 million poorest Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a so-called banana republic. This is the United
States,'' Nader said, asserting that many people are making less in
real wages than they were decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Workers should not be making less than what they made in 1968.
They should be making double what they made in 1968,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd fell into a chant of ''Let Ralph debate'' as Nader
called for his inclusion in upcoming debates between Republican
George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Touting his Green Party candidacy, Nader said Americans should
not have to choose between ''the lesser of two evils and the evil
of two lessers. Sometimes the safest thing to do is take a
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   He chided Americans for expecting too little from government.
</P>
<P>
   ''Raising our expectations is the first step toward empowering
ourselves,'' Nader said.

<P>
   He also praised the ''spirit of Seattle.'' Nader was a firsthand
observer last fall when the city streets were taken over by some
50,000 protesters during the meeting of the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Nader said he's pleased with recent momentum his campaign has
built. The Seattle stop was the third of four major Green Party
rallies. The second, in Minneapolis on Friday, drew 12,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   A Chicago Tribune poll conducted Sept. 11-17 found that Nader
had the support of about 4 percent of voters in five
''battleground'' states, including Illinois, Ohio, New Jersey,
Michigan and Pennsylvania.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia 8, United States 5  </HEADLINE>
By PETE IACOBELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Yugoslavia's Aleksandar Sapic bore
America no ill will, even though many of the country's fans did
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Often chanting ''Ser-bi-a, Ser-bi-a,'' during their team's 8-5
victory over the United States in Olympic water polo, Yugoslavia's
supporters made their displeasure known over the U.S.-led bombing
during the recent Balkan war.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't say that we have hard feelings against them,'' said
Sapic, who scored four goals to keep Yugoslavia undefeated at the
Sydney Games. ''We are sportsmen. We were all there when the bombs
were falling, but it was not the United States teams' doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia and the United States water polo teams have enjoyed a
long history of pleasant, tough training sessions, American coach
John Vargas said. ''They are very patriotic,'' Vargas said of the
crowd at Ryde Aquatic Leisure Center. ''It was great that
Yugoslavia had that kind of support.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Azevedo, the United States' 18-year-old driver, said he
wasn't paying attention to the chants. ''I tried to pretend they
were saying, 'U-S-A.'''
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't that much to cheer about for the Americans, who
lost their second straight match and must still face gold-medal
favorite Hungary and an improved Greek team to be among four
advancing from their six-team group.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think if we come out with the fire and the aggressive
want-to that we showed out there today over the next few games,
then we're right in this,'' Vargas said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was tripped up in this one by the water polo
team that made it settle for silver medals in the 1984 and 1988
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The American men, who flew Down Under with confidence and
momentum, may find themselves watching others go for the medals
they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Moving beyond the first round looked certain this summer.
Two-meter man Chris Humbert is one of the world's top scorers.
Goalie Dan Hackett is considered among the tournament's best
keepers. And American confidence was sky high last month when they
won a tune-up against Hungary in Budapest, 9-8.
</P>
<P>
   But the men were outgunned in the opening Olympic loss to
Croatia, 10-7, and quickly fell behind the Yugoslavs, 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   ''We always seem to get better at the end of tournaments,'' U.S.
team member Tony Azevedo said. ''I think that will happen here.''
</P>
<P>
   Only if the Americans tighten up.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett let Sapic squeeze in a shot with about two feet between
him and a sidepost. The American also gave up a rebound goal to
Vladimir Vujasinovic after Humbert had tied things at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   The United States got to 4-3 on Azevedo's goal off a nice touch
pass from Wolf Wigo with 4:28 left before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Sapic, though, came through again, skipping a shot past Hackett
two seconds before the break.
</P>
<P>
   Mistakes kept killing the Americans. They had a 6-on-4 advantage
when Sapic and Usokovic were both sent off. But no one would take a
shot in the 20-second penalty situation as Yugoslavia packed its
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Things didn't get much better in the second half. When Gavin
Arroyo's goal again brought the Americans within one, Danilo
Ikodinovic answered for Yugoslavia two minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   Sapic's third goal, with 8.7 seconds remaining in the third
quarter, capped it.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are just a few things we need to clean up,'' said
Vargas, who's thinking of waking his team several hours ahead of
their 9:30 a.m. (6:30 p.m. Sunday EDT) Monday match with
Netherlands to get their heads clear.
</P>
<P>
   The silver finishes at Los Angeles and Seoul are the last medals
for the American men. The only time the United States won water
polo gold was at the 1904 St. Louis Games when it was the only
country competing.

<HEADLINE> US-Australian Match Said Done  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The head of America's water polo
federation says there will be no appeal or protest of the closing
seconds of the U.S. women's Olympic water polo loss to Australia in
the gold-medal game.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Wigo, executive director of USA Water Polo, said Yvette
Higgins' game-winner in the closing seconds Saturday night was a
good goal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem is confusion over the rule,'' he said Sunday after
the American men lost to Yugoslavia 8-5.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. captain Julie Swail was called for a foul about 10 seconds
after America's Brenda Villa tied things at 3-3 in the final
minute.
</P>
<P>
   As Swail went off, Simone Hankin threw into Higgins outside the
7-meter area. Higgins rifled in the winning goal.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. coach Guy Baker chased the referees, complaining the score
should not count. FINA's Gianni Lonzi said through a spokesman that
the call stood. Replays seemed to bear that out, Wigo said.
</P>
<P>
   Baker and his players, despite some red, teary eyes, were very
gracious to the Aussies after the match.
</P>
<P>
   How were the Americans holding up the day after?
</P>
<P>
   ''I think when they got home, they felt a little better after
some celebrating,'' Wigo said. ''It's great they won the silver.''

<HEADLINE> Brazil 3, United States 1  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The U.S. women's volleyball team got
what it came for -- a chance to play for a medal.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is being able to beat the best teams in the world,
instead of just staying in the same gym with them.
</P>
<P>
   The United States gained valuable confidence even in losing its
first match of the Olympics, 25-17, 20-25, 25-15, 25-15 to Brazil
on Sunday (Saturday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   Although they've exceeded everyone's expectations by finishing
second in Group A, the players were disappointed they didn't put up
more of a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ''One game is a low expectation,'' said middle blocker Danielle
Scott. ''We expect to win, so I think we want to play a little bit
better than we did. We'll be satisfied after we win a medal.''
</P>
<P>
   Heather Bown, who had seven kills and four blocks, cried after
the loss, but acknowledged that the U.S. team is playing its best
at the perfect time.
</P>
<P>
   ''We came in here with our focus, to remind ourselves every day
what our purpose is here, and I think we've reached it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team will enter the quarterfinals with a 4-1 record,
and probably will play South Korea when the next round begins
Tuesday (Monday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   ''We got about what we wanted from this,'' U.S. coach Mick Haley
said. ''I'm not disappointed in this at all. I think our kids
played hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Having lost five straight matches in major tournaments to the
powerful Brazilians, the Americans didn't figure to have much of a
chance this time.
</P>
<P>
   But after getting blown out in the opening game, they got their
blocking going with Scott, Sarah Noriega and Bown, shutting down
star Brazilian hitters Leila Barros and Erika Coimbra to take a
10-5 lead in the second game.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team pushed it to 20-12 and got to game point before
faltering. Brazil scored five straight points to get to 24-20, but
Robyn Ah Mow set up Logan Tom perfectly for a slam down the middle
to square the match.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans led 6-4 to start the third, but Brazil went on a
10-2 spurt and the U.S. team didn't recover. The closest the United
States got in the fourth was 15-13.
</P>
<P>
   ''We learned a lot,'' said outside hitter Tara Cross-Battle. ''I
think it's better, if we're going to lose, to get our loss in now,
because we can't lose anymore. And now the team knows what it feels
like to lose, so they can focus on getting to the semifinals.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States didn't lead at all in the first game, but it
wasn't blown out, either. When Cross-Battle and Scott teamed up on
two emphatic stuff blocks, Brazil had only a 20-16 lead. The
Brazilians then scored five of the next six points to win the
opener.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we're both fortunate to meet in the gold medal match, then
it's going to be a good one,'' Cross-Battle said.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil and the Americans should have easy quarterfinal matches,
setting up a terrific final four with them, Cuba and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil coach Bernardo Rezende said Sunday's result wasn't that
important ''because both of the teams wanted to avoid Cuba and
Russia, and that did not change in this match.''
</P>
<P>
   In the quarterfinals, Brazil will face Germany, which stunned
Italy in four games Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In other action, Cuba virtually clinched the No. 2 spot in Group
B by beating Peru in four games, and Croatia locked up the No. 3
seed from Group A by defeating Kenya in four.

<HEADLINE> Madrigali Hangs On In Sailing  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The strongest winds yet in the Olympics
ended up blowing U.S. Soling skipper Jeff Madrigali right out of
the regatta.
</P>
<P>
   Madrigali, the 1996 bronze medalist and reigning world champion,
won just one of five match races Sunday (Saturday night EDT) and
was eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   With winds gusting to 15 knots on choppy Sydney Harbor,
Madrigali kept his slight hopes alive by beating three-time gold
medalist Jochen Schuemann of Germany in the fourth race.
</P>
<P>
   Madrigali, of Novato, Calif., then took the lead over Georgy
Shayduko at the start of the fifth race. But the Russian, a silver
medalist in 1996, gained from a wind shift and opened a huge lead
rounding the first mark. Madrigali was not able to close the gap.
</P>
<P>
   Beaten by progressively bigger margins in his first three match
races, Madrigali took the lead over Schuemann at the start of the
fourth race. He had a four-length lead heading into the first
downwind mark when he forced Schuemann into a luff. As Schuemann
had trouble controlling his boat, Madrigali headed to the mark.
</P>
<P>
   In the first race, Madrigali was edged by Australia's Neville
Wittey in wind that gusted to 15 knots, the strongest so far in the
regatta.
</P>
<P>
   Wittey, cheered on by fellow Aussies on shore and in spectator
boats, led at all five turning marks on the windward-leeward course
and beat Madrigali by less than a boat length.
</P>
<P>
   Madrigali then lost to Denmark's Jesper Bank, the 1992 gold
medalist and '88 bronze medalist. With the course shortened to two
windward-leeward laps, Bank led at all three marks and won by about
six lengths.
</P>
<P>
   Madrigali followed with a loss to Sweden's Hans Wallen, the 1996
silver medalist in the Star class.
</P>
<P>
   The three crews surviving this round robin join the top three
from the fleet racing in the quarterfinals. The medals will be
decided next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Watching from the U.S. chase boat on the rough afternoon was
Russell Coutts, who skippered New Zealand to two straight sweeps in
the America's Cup. He is serving as Madrigali's coach and tuning
partner. Coutts, who recently accepted a big-money offer to skipper
a Swiss boat in the next America's Cup, won an Olympic gold medal
in the Finn class in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Madrigali's crewmembers in the 26-foot boat are Craig Healy of
Tiburon, Calif., and Hartwell Jordan of Discovery Bay, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Italy's Alessandra Sensini won the women's windsurfing gold
medal and Austria's Christoph Sieber won the men's gold.
</P>
<P>
   Sensini won the 11th and final fleet race by seven seconds over
Amelie Lux of Germany. Sensini and Lux tied with 15 points, but
Sensini won the gold medal based on five fleet-race victories to
three for Lux. Sensini won the bronze medal in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand's Barbara Kendall won the bronze, completing a set
of Olympic medals. She won the gold in 1992 and silver in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Sensini, Lux and Kendall combined to win all 11 races. Lanee
Butler of Aliso Viejo, Calif., was fourth, her best finish in three
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, Roland Gaebler and Rene Schwall of Germany won the
bronze medal in the Tornado class. Roman Hagara and Hans Peter
Steinacher of Austria clinched the gold on Friday and Darren
Bundock and John Forbes of Australia earned the silver on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The American crew, John Lovell of New Orleans and Charlie
Ogletree of Newport Beach, Calif., finished seventh.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Fourth In Sychronized Swimming  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The Olympics are sort of a homecoming
for Anna Kozlova.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, she was competing for the Unified Team as a
Russian in duet in synchronized swimming. Now she is competing for
the United States and duets is back on the docket after being
dropped at the Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
   Kozlova is one of the few Olympic athletes competing for a
second nation. She and Tuesday Middaugh combined to place fourth
Sunday. They have a chance at a medal, finishing just a few tenths
from third-place France after the technical routine.
</P>
<P>
   Russia which hasn't lost a duet since 1997, and Japan were first
and second, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The duet competition continues for the next two days, with the
field cut to 12 on Monday, and then the final freestyle worth 65
percent of the total score on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago in Barcelona, Kozlova came in fourth for the
Unified team as a Russian. After emigrating to the United States
the following year, then patiently waiting to gain her citizenship
last October, she is finally able to compete internationally again.
</P>
<P>
   This is her first major championship since becoming eligible for
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   She is quick to cite the similarities and differences of
competing in the Olympics as a Russian and an American.
</P>
<P>
   ''Competition is competition. When you compete you want to
perform the same way,'' Kozlova said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But it not the same way now, because I think Americans are the
best competitors. They have fun when they train. They have a team
spirit that not too many countries have. They make it brighter and
more exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the former Soviet Union, sports were regarded more as a
job rather than a pastime. That was part of the reason Kozlova
wanted to move.
</P>
<P>
   When Kozlova came to Santa Clara, Calif., in August 1993 for the
wedding of an American swimmer, she stayed.
</P>
<P>
   While she waited for citizenship, she still competed nationally
and completed a sweep of solo, duet and team for three of the last
four years; nationals were an open event.
</P>
<P>
   Now she is back at the Olympics. Coincidentally, a number of her
former teammates from Russia are either competing or coaching for
other countries.
</P>
<P>
   She and Middaugh, of Riverside, Calif., had 33.810 points.
France is third with 33.997.
</P>
<P>
   Similar to figure skating, the technical portion had eight
required elements to music of the competitors' choice. It is marked
on artistic and technical merit.
</P>
<P>
   To a percussion version of a song from the musical ''FOS''
specially arranged for them, the Americans had marks of 9.6 through
9.8 from the 10 judges.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, using the traditional folk song ''Kalinka,'' led with
34.58, scoring nearly all 9.9s out of a possible 10.
</P>
<P>
   The team competition, which the United States won in Atlanta,
begins on Thursday.

Accusations Threaten Yugoslav Vote

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- On the eve of a historic election that polls say
Slobodan Milosevic will lose, the government claimed Saturday that opposition
parties plan to declare victory and set up a rival administration in pro-Western
Montenegro regardless of the outcome. The government-run election commission
then announced that voters in Sunday's presidential, parliamentary and local
election must show their marked ballots to electoral officials before placing
them in the box. The opposition denied any such plot and accused the Milosevic
government of trying to intimidate voters.

Lazio, Clinton Seem To Reach Deal
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Rep. Rick Lazio and Hillary Rodham Clinton appeared to have
reached a deal late Saturday banning the use of so-called soft money advertising
from the New York Senate race. Soft money refers to the unlimited funds
collected by political parties. While hard money contributions, limited to
$2,000 per donor, can be used for ads that advocate voting for or against a
candidate, soft money can only be used to advocate an issue, boost a candidate
or attack a candidate. The verbal agreements came after a day of public
back-and-forth, and about a week and a half after Lazio sprung his version of a
soft money ban on Clinton during their first televised debate and demanded she
sign it on the spot. Clinton refused and later called Lazio's action a stunt.

   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Naoko Takahashi, running alone for the last four

marathon Sunday (Saturday night EDT) and raised her arms in triumph. Then she

Olympic-best 2 hours, 23 minutes, 14 seconds to become the first Japanese woman
to win an Olympic track and field gold medal.

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Gabriel Hernandez put in a long rebound
with 55 seconds to go as defending Olympic gold medalist Spain
defeated Slovakia 7-6 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Spain, which defeated Kazakstan in its opener, moved to the top
of Group A at 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish trailed 6-5 with 3:49 left when Javier Sanchez Toril
tied it on a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Pedrerol started the winning play when his blast banked
off the left sidepost and came out to Hernandez, who immediately
whipped it past goalie Stefan Gergely.
</P>
<P>
   Spain has won gold in Atlanta and silver in Barcelona, led by
38-year-old star Manuel Estiarte who is playing in his sixth
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   But Slovakia kept the all-time Olympic scorer off the board. It
just couldn't stop Hernandez, who finished with three goals. Pedro
Garcia scored twice for Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kaid led Slovakia with three goals.
</P>
<P>
   Spain next faces Italy. Slovakia (0-2) needs to defeat Australia
in its next match to stay in medal contention.
</P>
<P>
   Referee Elisabeth Janseen van de Laak of the Netherlands made
history at the game as the first woman to officiate an Olympic
water polo match.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea Ask For Food For North  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- South Korea's president on Sunday asked Japan to
increase shipments of food to North Korea as part of a joint effort
to improve relations with the impoverished Stalinist nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''North Korea would be very appreciative if Japan would provide
aid at this very difficult time,'' said South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung on the last day of a two-day meeting with Japanese Prime
Minister Yoshiro Mori.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Japan decided to resume food aid to the North that was
suspended in 1998 after Pyongyang tested a ballistic missile.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Japan has delivered almost 100,000 tons of rice to
the reclusive state, which is suffering food shortages following
severe drought and typhoons.
</P>
<P>
   Mori told Kim that Tokyo is considering giving additional
assistance. Suspicion has been rife in Japan that the North is
using food donations to feed its soldiers rather than starving
families.
</P>
<P>
   Kim left Japan on Sunday afternoon. His request came a day after
he and Mori agreed to improve economic and cultural ties while
cooperating to reduce military tensions on the divided Korean
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   The desire to ease tensions amid the shared threat of North
Korea's missile program has helped to unite Japan and South Korea,
long separated by wartime resentment, in the pursuit of greater
stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Kim was visiting Japan for the first time since holding a
historic summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il in June. A
notable thaw has begun between the rivals, and Japan has taken a
keen interest in the detente.
</P>
<P>
   Kim told Mori that he had the impression during the June summit
that North Korean leader Kim Jong Il was eager to normalize ties
with Japan. Negotiators from the two nations have met twice this
year but are still hamstrung by long-standing grievances.
</P>
<P>
   As part of efforts to improve economic and cultural ties, Kim
and Mori agreed to expand cooperation in e-commerce and information
technology, and Kim said he would welcome a visit by the Japanese
emperor to South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Kim also urged Japan to adopt a bill to extend local voting
rights to the 700,000 ethnic Koreans living in Japan by the end of
the year, and
</P>
<P>
   Mori responded that he was working hard for its passage.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of South Koreans were brought to Japan before World
War II to work under slave labor conditions. Their descendants,
most of whom do not have Japanese citizenship, say they deserve a
say in the way they are governed.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Starts Fund-Raising Weekend  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) -- Contributors paid $10,000 each to
attend a Democratic fund-raiser Saturday in Silicon Valley where
they listened to President Clinton muse for 21 minutes about
politics and world affairs. That's roughly $475 a minute.
</P>
<P>
   The president's appearance helped raise $400,000 for at the
Democratic National Committee luncheon, one of eight events
scheduled over three days in California and New Mexico. Seven are
political events or fund-raisers for the Democrats who seek to
retain control of the White House and reclaim majorities in both
the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that we are going to do very well in the Senate races
and I think we'll do very well in the House races,'' Clinton said,
adding a plug for his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is running
for a Senate seat from New York. ''But we have to win the White
House because of the stark differences on economics, the
environment, crime, education, health care -- all these issues.
There are real differences.''
</P>
<P>
   The guests, including many Indian-Americans, gathered at the
modern, pink stucco home of Dr. Anmol Mahal that sits on a hillside
in Fremont, Calif. ''I hope that if we do (win), and I believe we
will, that you will intensify your involvement -- that you will
continue to support the fund-raisers, but I want to see more
Indian-Americans in the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton began his day Saturday with a statement on the South
Lawn of the White House, saying his decision to tap the U.S.
emergency crude oil reserve to drive down gas and heating oil
prices was not motivated by politics. Then it was off to California
for three days of pure politics. His three events on Saturday alone
raised more than $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Both Vice President Al Gore and his GOP rival, Texas Gov. George
W. Bush, want to pocket California and its 54 electoral votes -- a
fifth of the 270 needed to win the presidency. On Monday, Bush
begins a five-day West Coast campaign swing that includes
California.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Saturday, Clinton was helping raise an estimated
$350,000 at a teriyaki chicken barbecue at private residence in San
Jose, Calif., for Mike Honda. The California state assemblyman and
former teacher is running for a seat in the House against
Republican Jim Cunneen, a state assemblyman and former corporate
executive.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't tell you how important I think it is for Mike and so
many of our other good candidates here to win these House races,''
Clinton told the 350 guests, who were asked to contribute $1,000
each. ''I have a so much greater appreciation than I ever did
before I became president of the importance of every single seat in
the House, every single seat in the Senate. Our economic plan in
1993 passed by a single vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Later on Saturday, Clinton spoke to 150 people at a Democratic
Congressional Committee Dinner held at a private residence in
Brentwood, Calif., in greater Los Angeles. The president was
introduced by House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, who praised
Clinton for doing 137 events this political season to help Gore and
Democratic candidates for the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The president thanked the crowd, which was sprinkled with
Hollywood celebrities, for their contributions, which totaled $4.4
million. And he asked them each to talk about the election with
their friends.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tell them why you came here tonight, why you know Dick
Gephardt ought to be speaker (of the House), why you're trying to
help us win the Senate, why Al Gore and Joe Lieberman should be
elected,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> 25 Arrested Over Jakarta Bombings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesian police said Sunday they had
arrested 25 people suspected of carrying out a spate of bombings in
the capital, including a blast at the Jakarta stock exchange that
killed 15.
</P>
<P>
   The bombings had coincided with advances in a corruption case
against ex-dictator Suharto and many have speculated the attacks
were the work of his supporters opposed to President Abdurrahman
Wahid's democratic reforms. The claim has been denied by Suharto's
family and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   One suspect confessed that he had also planned to bomb Jakarta's
U.S. Embassy and a department store, said Brig. Gen. Dadang
Garnida, who heads the police information department.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests came one day after Wahid installed a new national
police chief and ordered the security forces to take quick action
to stop the attacks, which he claimed were designed to undermine
his reformist government.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the first suspect was arrested on Saturday. After
his interrogation, 24 others were detained on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are suspected of being responsible for all the bombings
in Jakarta,'' Garnida said. ''One suspect said he was going to bomb
the U.S. Embassy and Sarinah (department store) next.''
</P>
<P>
   All the suspects are Indonesian and none are police or military
personnel, said Senior Superintendent Saleh Saaf, deputy national
police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   A grenade was seized when some of the suspects were arrested, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 13, a car bomb blew up and set fire to the basement
garage of the Jakarta stock exchange, killing 15 people.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 1, another car bomb exploded outside the Philippine
ambassador's residence, killing two people and injuring dozens,
including the envoy.
</P>
<P>
   There have been bomb attacks at the Malaysian Embassy and the
office of Indonesia's attorney general. A bus was blown up a few
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto's corruption trial started Aug. 31. He is charged with
stealing at least $583 million in government money to bankroll
businesses controlled by his cronies and children.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto, who was ousted from office in 1998 amid pro-democracy
protests and riots, has refused to attend his hearing on the
grounds of failing health.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department warned U.S. citizens last week that
American companies and interests might be targeted by the bombers.
Anti-American sentiment in Indonesia has risen recently.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 18, visiting U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
warned that economic sanctions might be imposed on the world's
fourth-most populous nation unless Jakarta reined in militia gangs
that continue to cause havoc on Timor island.
</P>
<P>
   The warning came after militia gangs killed three U.N.
humanitarian workers, including a U.S. citizen, in the West Timor
town of Atambua on Sept. 6.
</P>
<P>
   There have been several anti-American demonstrations and U.S.
flag burnings since Cohen's threat.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Embassy officials were not immediately available for
comment.

<HEADLINE> State says first federal report will show reforms work  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Better training, improved paper work and
computer-collected statistics on motor vehicle stops will show New
Jersey is working to reform the state police, state authorities
claim.
</P>
<P>
   The first report card from a court-ordered federal monitor is
expected Wednesday and state officials predict favorable marks.
</P>
<P>
   After one year on the job, New Jersey's director of state police
reforms admitted much more is needed, but said basic changes were
required to insure the success of programs designed to eliminate
racial profiling by troopers.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what has been done are first steps in complying with the
agreement between New Jersey and the U.S. Attorney's Office to end
discrimination, Martin Cronin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''By our own admission, we have a long way to go before we are
in compliance, but we have to be realistic. We have to do it right,
rather than do it quick,'' Cronin said.
</P>
<P>
   The first test comes this week.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the Justice Department agreed to the legal
settlement with the state, which included the appointment of an
independent civilian monitor for the state police.
</P>
<P>
   The state agreed to provide regular reports on reforms,
including the number of motor vehicle stops, each driver's race, a
reason for the stop and actions taken by the trooper.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey has five years to comply with the consent decree and
must show it is in ''substantial compliance'' for two consecutive
years at any point before federal supervision ends.
</P>
<P>
   The federal monitor's report grades New Jersey in three areas.
</P>
<P>
   The examination looks to see if the state has the proper rules
and regulations in place to eliminate discrimination, if troopers
are properly trained and if the practices work.
</P>
<P>
   Cronin says the state is clearly on the way to meeting the first
requirement.
</P>
<P>
   New training programs are in place and more are being designed,
all targeting specific areas in the consent decree and in two state
reports that detailed racial profiling, Cronin said.
</P>
<P>
   The third area could take years before substantial changes are
permanently in place, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a slow process, no question about it. But I'm extremely
pleased with the changes we have made over the past year,'' said
Attorney General John J. Farmer, Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Early indications are the federal monitor will agree, Farmer
said. Two members of an inspection team, including the appointed
federal overseer, were in Trenton last week to see what has been
done.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were both extremely pleased at what they saw going on
here,'' Farmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Cronin, a former federal drug prosecutor, heads an office of
five attorneys, four investigators and two troopers.
</P>
<P>
   His department answers all legal questions for the state police
superintendent for every area of business except criminal
investigations, Cronin said.
</P>
<P>
   The job is to detail procedures that answer the charges raised
in the consent decree and the state reports that admitted racial
profiling was real.
</P>
<P>
   State police Col. Carson Dunbar oversees daily operations while
Cronin works to implement reforms, Farmer said.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general decided after hiring him that Cronin would
only focus on changes, not looking into allegations of race-based
abuse, Farmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Charges of racial profiling became public after April 23, 1998,
when two white troopers on the turnpike fired 11 shots at a van
carrying four men, all minorities.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1999, then Attorney General Peter Verniero released a
report that said racial profiling is ''real, not imagined.'' The
report acknowledges blacks not only are pulled over more often,
they are far more likely to be searched than whites.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, Farmer issued a second state police report
detailing poor handling of citizen complaints and racial
discrimination within the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   A computer system that collects and reports data from motor
vehicle stops is being tested and nearly ready for use by all state
police road troopers, Cronin said.
</P>
<P>
   That multimillion dollar investment will complement revised
training practices, he said. Instead of classes of 140 troopers,
officers now learn in small groups with practical examples.
</P>
<P>
   Training is better and more frequent, Cronin said.
</P>
<P>
   In time the training, equipment and changes in official
procedures will give the state police the improvement federal and
state officials demand, Cronin said.
</P>
<P>
   The reforms will be working long after the Whitman
administration that ordered them is gone, Cronin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is still here. It will still be here because it works,''
Cronin said. ''You'll have troopers performing this job for several
years. This will be what it is because it will be working.''

<HEADLINE> S.Korea Asks For Food For North  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- South Korea's president on Sunday asked Japan to
increase shipments of food to North Korea as part of a joint effort
to improve relations with the impoverished Stalinist nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''North Korea would be very appreciative if Japan would provide
aid at this very difficult time,'' South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung said on the last day of a two-day meeting with Japanese
Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Japan decided to resume food aid to the North that was
suspended in 1998 after Pyongyang tested a ballistic missile.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Japan has delivered almost 100,000 tons of rice to
the reclusive state, which is suffering food shortages following
severe drought and typhoons.
</P>
<P>
   Mori told Kim that Tokyo is considering giving additional
assistance. Suspicion has been rife in Japan that the North is
using food donations to feed its soldiers rather than starving
families.
</P>
<P>
   Kim's request came a day after he and Mori agreed to improve
economic and cultural ties while cooperating to reduce military
tensions on the divided Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   The desire to ease tensions amid the shared threat of North
Korea's missile program has helped to unite Japan and South Korea,
long separated by wartime resentment, in the pursuit of greater
stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Kim, who left Japan on Sunday, was visiting for the first time
since holding a historic summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong
Il in June. A notable thaw has begun between the rivals, and Japan
has taken a keen interest in the detente.
</P>
<P>
   Kim told Mori that he had the impression during the June summit
that North Korean leader Kim Jong Il was eager to normalize ties
with Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators from the two nations have met twice this year but
are still hamstrung by long-standing grievances, such as Japan's
demands for information on citizens allegedly kidnapped by the
North to train spies.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, North Korea again denied the abductions and said it
was not interested in opening diplomatic ties with Japan if Tokyo
keeps insisting on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea ''does not care about whether diplomatic relations
with Japan are improved or not,'' the state-run Rodong Sinmun daily
said in a commentary carried by the North's official foreign news
outlet, KCNA.

<HEADLINE> Teen, Nazi Relations Coming to TV  </HEADLINE>
By DAFNA LINZER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nazis spared 16-year-old Faye Schulman
because she had a talent they were looking for -- she could take
pictures and develop film.
</P>
<P>
   Then they gave her a roll of black-and-white images that filled
the Polish girl with unimaginable horror.
</P>
<P>
   As she dredged the paper through trays of solutions, it became
increasingly clear that she was staring at her dead family --
murdered together with hundreds of other Jews from the same Polish
town one day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The fury would push her to a life among the partisans where she
documented their successes and waged war on the evil that destroyed
everything she knew. With a vengeance, she and the partisans
returned to her village where the Nazis had established a base and
burned it to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ''When it was time to be hugging a boyfriend, I was hugging a
rifle,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Schulman's story is one of three beautifully told in ''Daring to
Resist,'' a moving documentary on a subject rarely touched on in
the history of World War II -- teen-age girls who used their wits to
outsmart and outfight Nazi tyranny in Poland, Hungary and the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Stripped of the sweet adolescent moments of young love,
innocence and never-ending time, Schulman, Barbara Rodbell and
Shulamit Lack spent their teen-age years forging papers, hiding
strangers and carrying guns. They lived orphaned in Nazi-occupied
lands under the constant fear of being caught and being killed.
Their voices speak for young women oppressed everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Produced and directed by two Philadelphia-area filmmakers,
Martha Lubell and Barbara Attie, ''Daring to Resist'' will be aired
Monday on PBS at 10:30 p.m. Eastern (check local listings).
</P>
<P>
   Historical footage mixed with the sensitive narration of actress
Janeane Garofalo help the three women -- now late in life -- to share
their experiences in emotionally personal verse.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Barbara Rodbell, a young German ballerina who
passed for a Christian girl in Amsterdam, is emblematic of a feisty
teen with a will to persevere.
</P>
<P>
   Like Anne Frank, whose sister was Rodbell's childhood friend,
Rodbell lived a secret life. And like the Franks, her family too
went on a train from Amsterdam to Auschwitz, the Nazi death camp.
</P>
<P>
   The family had left Germany at the start of the war, fleeing to
the Netherlands where they believed they would be safe.
</P>
<P>
   But as Adolf Hitler's Germany occupied European capitals
one-by-one, it became clear that Jews would be persecuted there,
too. Rodbell, a striking young brunette with fair features, knew
something terrible was waiting to unfold. She left her family's
home several months before they were taken away, and boarded with a
German woman who was a Nazi sympathizer.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the Jewish ghetto and working in the ballet, Rodbell
could have lived in relative security.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she used ballet, and the access it gave her, as a cover
for underground activities that included moving Jews to safe
houses.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Rodbell revisits the same Dutch streets she had
traversed under the cover of darkness, carefully explaining how she
carried bags of partisan newspapers, often to people she never saw,
and how she lied to German officers to cross bridges and roads
closed to Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Hungary, Shulamit Lack was also working to save
her kin. Like Rodbell and Schulman, she saved many but was unable
to save her own family.
</P>
<P>
   A rebellious teen from the start, Lack responded to schoolyard
anti-Semitism by rejecting her family's Hungarian pride and joining
a Zionist youth movement.
</P>
<P>
   She begged her parents to leave Hungary for the safety of
Palestine. As she arranged false travel papers for dozens and
skirted Jews across the border into Romania, she begged her own
parents to leave Hungary. Her mother refused, and when the Nazis
captured Budapest in 1944, she was sent to Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   Testimonials often bring a certain comfort to outsiders in
knowing that, despite the most inhumane circumstances, the
storyteller has somehow survived.
</P>
<P>
   So is the case with ''Daring to Resist.'' Despite the sheer
horror and loneliness of their young lives, all three have grown
old and gray in comfortable homes. Rodbell has been in New York
since 1947. Lack also made New York her home, after 15 years in
Israel. Schulman moved to Canada in 1948, after two years in a
displaced persons camp.

<HEADLINE> Archaeologists To Study Shipwrecks  </HEADLINE>
By ARTHUR MAX
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEXEL ISLAND, Netherlands (AP) -- Corneilis Claesoon's merchant
vessel, bearing a cargo of grain from Poland to the Mediterranean,
eased into the sound off this westerly island to seek shelter from
the rising storm.
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1592, or maybe 1593, and Claesoon, the gunner, was
on board to operate a small 4-pounder cannon to protect the ship
from pirates who prowled the English Channel and from the feared
marauders of north Africa's Barbary Coast.
</P>
<P>
   A fierce wind howled through the narrow gap between Texel Island
and the Dutch mainland. The Waddenzee, the marshy sea north of the
Dutch mainland, was crowded with ships, their square-rigged sails
tightly furled waiting out the storm. But the wind proved too
strong.
</P>
<P>
   Vessels twisted and strained at their anchors as the wind
shifted. The huge metal prongs couldn't hold their grip in the soft
sandy seabed, and the wind-blown ships dragged them across the
shallow water, snapping the anchor lines of others. Oak wood
cracked as the ships broke free and crunched into each other.
Sailors jumped in panic as their boats collided and sank.
</P>
<P>
   The story is reasonable conjecture pieced together from the
remains of the ship and the clutter of nearby wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   They are just some of as many as 20,000 ships that lie at the
bottom of the sea off the Dutch coast, according to estimates by
the Netherlands Institute for Ship and Underwater Archaeology.
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand of those ships are older than 200 years. Much
of the wreckage, although broken and scattered, has been remarkably
well preserved in the sand under the treacherous sea around the
Netherlands, making the coast an untapped archaeological trove.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nowhere will you find conditions like this,'' said Arent Vos,
head of the institute's six-man archaeological diving unit. Marine
archaeology, a relatively new science, is proving to be a powerful
tool for historians. ''You will find stuff that you will never find
on land,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vos's team retrieved a 300-year-old bottle of wine which experts
found to be ''surprisingly good'' when it was opened last month.
</P>
<P>
   In the 16th and 17th centuries, Holland built an empire and huge
wealth on the backs of its trading fleet, which left Dutch names
scattered from Spitsbergen in the Arctic to Tasmania in Australia,
and Staten Island and New Amsterdam, later to become New York City.
</P>
<P>
   But little is known about the ships themselves or the
shipwrights. The men who helped create the most powerful and
richest mercantile nation then on earth were illiterate, leaving no
records or drawings as they redesigned ships for greater speed and
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the British navy of mighty warships manned by hundreds of
sailors, the Dutch merchant marine was largely a fleet of light,
bulky vessels called ''fluiten,'' or flyboats.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a century, some 3,000 ships left Dutch ports every
year carrying half of Europe's trade. Only a handful of larger
vessels made long-distance voyages to the Spice Islands -- now part
of Indonesia -- and elsewhere in Asia, Africa and the New World.
</P>
<P>
   Because they were built cheaply to last only 15 years or so, few
of the ships have survived.
</P>
<P>
   Shipwrecks were so common they became a motif of 17th century
art. Contemporaries of Rembrandt and Vermeer painted heroic
pictures of ships struggling in stormy seas, and shipwreck epics
were the stuff of pulp fiction.
</P>
<P>
   For the modern historian, ''each wreck is a story and a drama. A
few good men died on these ships,'' said Vos.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some went down in a moment. So it's kind of like a time
capsule,'' he said, stripping off his wet suit to relax on the bow
of his research ship, completing one of his last dives of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Vos has learned a lot, for example, about the gunner Claesoon
and life on board his 105-foot ship, which he found after a tip
from local fishermen when the seabed shifted to expose the wreckage
after 400 years.
</P>
<P>
   Although Vos is still searching for the ship's name, he knows
from the pattern of rings in the timber that it was built in 1582.
The grain it carried was a type grown in Poland, and the light
armament indicated its destination was the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   Claesoon, from the northern Dutch town of Blokdijk, left his
name chiseled into the handle of the stick that he used to light
his cannon's fuse, along with a few lines of rhyme in old Dutch.
</P>
<P>
   He slept on a bedbug-plagued mattress of straw. The 17 pewter
spoons found in the wreckage means he was one of probably no more
than 20 crewmen. Each sailor had his own spoon -- his only utensil.
Barrels contained the remains of fish, beef and oil.
</P>
<P>
   Vos believes the ship may have gone down with 43 others in a
great storm that hammered the Waddenzee in 1592. If that's true,
then Claesoon appears to have survived, since his name appears on a
list of gunnery men on another ship in 1593.

<HEADLINE> Exercise May Help Fight Depression  </HEADLINE>
By IRA DREYFUSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Exercise works at least as well as a popular
prescription drug in treating clinical depression and keeping the
condition from returning, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at Duke University Medical Center tested exercise
against Zoloft, and found the ability of either -- or a combination
of the two -- to reduce or eliminate symptoms were about the same.
But they found exercise seemed to do a better job of keeping
symptoms from coming back after the depression lifted.
</P>
<P>
   ''The present findings suggest that a modest exercise program
... is an effective, robust treatment for patients with major
depression,'' said the report in the October issue of the journal
Psychosomatic Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The findings go well beyond the idea that exercise fights the
blues. ''It was not just that they had a bad day -- or a bad several
days,'' said James A. Blumenthal, lead researcher.
</P>
<P>
   The patients in this study and others in a continuing series of
experiments at Duke had been diagnosed with major depressive
disorder. Their loss of pleasure, and feelings of worthlessness and
guilt, had to exist for at least two weeks, Blumenthal said. The
severity of their symptoms was generally mild to moderate, but in
some cases was severe, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The October report followed earlier research in which 156 adult
volunteers had taken part in a four-month comparison of exercise,
Zoloft or a combination. The exercise primarily consisted of brisk
walking, stationary bike riding, or jogging for 30 minutes, plus a
10-minute warmup and 5-minute cooldown, 3 times a week.
</P>
<P>
   After four months, patients in all groups had comparable
improvements, the researchers said. About 60 percent of the
exercisers had vastly improved or had no symptoms, compared with
about 66 percent of the medication group and 69 percent of the
combination group.
</P>
<P>
   The new study was an attempt to see if the benefits continued
after the earlier study ended. At this point, 10 months from the
beginning of the project, researchers checked 133 of their old
research subjects who had stuck with the program.
</P>
<P>
   Exercisers who had been in remission after 4 months were far
less likely to see their depression return after 10 months,
compared with people taking the drug or a combination therapy, the
study found. Eight percent of exercisers saw symptoms come back,
compared with 38 percent of those taking drugs and 31 percent
getting both.
</P>
<P>
   It will take more research to discover why exercise should work
better than prescription drug use. But it's possible that
exercisers gained a sense of control over their lives that
drug-takers could not match, Blumenthal said. It's also unclear why
combination therapy did not work better than either alone, he said.
</P>
<P>
   How exercise could create the benefit is not known either,
Blumenthal said. The once-popular idea that natural mood-enhancing
chemicals called endorphins go up because of exercise is hard to
prove because the experiment would require samples to be drawn from
the central nervous system, he said. The usual method, taking
endorphin levels from blood in the circulatory system, can be
considered only a second-best way to find out, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zoloft, made by Pfizer Inc., helps the body to regulate levels
of another brain chemical, serotonin, which is also believed to
affect mood.
</P>
<P>
   The studies do not prove exercise relieves depression, in part
because the exercisers worked out in a group, so group dynamics may
have played a role, Blumenthal said. A new study will attempt to
find out, by comparing supervised group exercisers with people who
were simply given an exercise plan and sent home, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The published findings may not apply to all depression patients,
because the study worked with volunteers, Blumenthal said.
Volunteers presumably would be more likely to stick with exercise
than would patients who simply were told by their doctors to
exercise, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sounds like very interesting work,'' said Dr. Robert Pohl
of Wayne State University in Ohio, who was not connected with the
Duke project.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's possible some of the improvements in the Duke study
came from patients' attempts to please the researchers, said Pohl,
a psychiatry professor who treats patients with depression.
</P>
<P>
   And getting people to exercise is not easy. Most Americans,
depressed or not, don't work out enough. ''I always try to get my
patients exercising, and I can't do it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Hawaii Adamant About Quarantine  </HEADLINE>
By BEN DiPIETRO
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU (AP) -- Sara Lempa doesn't understand why her
10-year-old Golden Retriever, Maizey, is caged for four months at
Hawaii's state-run animal quarantine.
</P>
<P>
   In the 88 years since the facility was established to keep the
islands rabies-free, Hawaii never has detected a case of rabies.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears to me they'd rather not have animals come in,''
Lempa said as she and her son, Chris, sat inside the cage with
Maizey, who was in the fifth day of her 120-day stay.
</P>
<P>
   The Lempas moved from San Diego after Kevin Lempa was hired as
defensive coordinator for the University of Hawaii football team.
</P>
<P>
   ''He took the job before we knew about the quarantine,'' Sara
Lempa said.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii law requires dogs and cats to be quarantined upon arrival
for either 30 or 120 days. To qualify for a 30-day stay, pet owners
must show their animals have twice been vaccinated against rabies --
with the last shot coming at least 90 days but not longer than one
year before the pet arrives. Animals also must be implanted with a
microchip to ensure proper identification.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arrival, the pets must undergo a third blood test to detect
rabies.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't do everything we were supposed to. It's very
confusing, the timeline,'' Lempa said. ''I feel like the law should
be more uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've moved a lot of times, but this is the most amount of red
tape we've encountered.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the absence of rabies here, quarantine director Dr.
James Foppoli said the state can't risk the exposure that would
pose a potential public health threat and cause serious
environmental damage.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't have to catch cases to justify the quarantine,''
which started in 1912 after reports of a rabies outbreak in
California, Foppoli said. ''Just to say we haven't seen any rabies
cases and do away with quarantine is to seriously underestimate the
threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Foppoli said no rabies cases have been detected because pets
brought to quarantine generally receive better care.
</P>
<P>
   People with strays or farm animals, both of which are more
likely to have rabies, tend not to bring them, he said. Another
reason is not enough animals pass through quarantine.
</P>
<P>
   ''You need a large number of animals before you will see a
case,'' Foppoli said. ''It's kind of like a lottery, where a person
keeps on buying tickets to increase their chances of winning. The
more animals come in, the more likely you'll see a rabies case.''
</P>
<P>
   A study published in August in the Journal of American Medical
Association found rabies cases in the United States declined from
more than 100 a year in the early 1900s to a total of 32 cases
between 1980 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Rabies can cause death within a week of infection, likely
through cardiac or respiratory failure, according to the National
Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, all incoming dogs and cats were quarantined 120
days. The state began permitting 30-day stays in September 1997.
Since then, the number of quarantined pets has increased, with the
number exceeding 4,000 every year since the shorter stays were
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   For the year ended June 30, 4,048 pets were placed in
quarantine, compared with 3,380 in 1997 and 2,215 in 1983. A 30-day
stay costs $655, while a 120-day stay costs $1,055.
</P>
<P>
   Pending federal legislation would provide a partial rebate for
military families, who account for much of the quarantine's
business. The quarantine costs $2.7 million to operate annually and
brings in slightly more money than that, Foppoli said.
</P>
<P>
   Pets are kept in cages 6 feet wide, 7 feet high and either 14
feet or 25 feet long, with the longer cages for bigger dogs. The
animals are cared for by 46 state workers -- more during the peak
summer months -- including two veterinarians and two veterinarian
technicians. If a pet has a medical problem requiring more than
superficial attention, it is taken to an outside animal hospital at
the owner's expense.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1988, about 7 of every 1,000 cats and dogs brought to
quarantine die while in confinement, Foppoli said. Based on last
year's numbers, that comes out to 28 animals.
</P>
<P>
   Visitation at the barracks-like facility west of Pearl Harbor is
allowed five afternoons a week. People who agree to clean their
pet's cage and groom their animal can visit every morning.
</P>
<P>
   The only exceptions made for quarantine are for service animals,
such as guide and seizure response dogs, or for animals coming from
three rabies-free islands: Great Britain, Australia and New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   For the Lempas, quarantine time can't pass fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not exactly pleased with this idea,'' Sara Lempa said.
''We thought about whether we would bring her, but we wanted her
with us no matter what.''

<HEADLINE> Documentary Marks Anti-Nazi Teens  </HEADLINE>
By DAFNA LINZER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nazis spared 16-year-old Faye Schulman
because she had a talent they were looking for -- she could take
pictures and develop film.
</P>
<P>
   Then they gave her a roll of black-and-white images that filled
the Polish girl with unimaginable horror.
</P>
<P>
   As she dredged the paper through trays of solutions, it became
increasingly clear that she was staring at her dead family --
murdered together with hundreds of other Jews from the same Polish
town one day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The fury would push her to a life among the partisans where she
documented their successes and waged war on the evil that destroyed
everything she knew. With a vengeance, she and the partisans
returned to her village where the Nazis had established a base and
burned it to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ''When it was time to be hugging a boyfriend, I was hugging a
rifle,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Schulman's story is one of three beautifully told in ''Daring to
Resist,'' a moving documentary on a subject rarely touched on in
the history of World War II -- teen-age girls who used their wits to
outsmart and outfight Nazi tyranny in Poland, Hungary and the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Stripped of the sweet adolescent moments of young love,
innocence and never-ending time, Schulman, Barbara Rodbell and
Shulamit Lack spent their teen-age years forging papers, hiding
strangers and carrying guns. They lived orphaned in Nazi-occupied
lands under the constant fear of being caught and being killed.
Their voices speak for young women oppressed everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Produced and directed by two Philadelphia-area filmmakers,
Martha Lubell and Barbara Attie, ''Daring to Resist'' will be aired
Monday on PBS at 10:30 p.m. Eastern (check local listings).
</P>
<P>
   Historical footage mixed with the sensitive narration of actress
Janeane Garofalo help the three women -- now late in life -- to share
their experiences in emotionally personal verse.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Barbara Rodbell, a young German ballerina who
passed for a Christian girl in Amsterdam, is emblematic of a feisty
teen with a will to persevere.
</P>
<P>
   Like Anne Frank, whose sister was Rodbell's childhood friend,
Rodbell lived a secret life. And like the Franks, her family too
went on a train from Amsterdam to Auschwitz, the Nazi death camp.
</P>
<P>
   The family had left Germany at the start of the war, fleeing to
the Netherlands where they believed they would be safe.
</P>
<P>
   But as Adolf Hitler's Germany occupied European capitals
one-by-one, it became clear that Jews would be persecuted there,
too. Rodbell, a striking young brunette with fair features, knew
something terrible was waiting to unfold. She left her family's
home several months before they were taken away, and boarded with a
German woman who was a Nazi sympathizer.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the Jewish ghetto and working in the ballet, Rodbell
could have lived in relative security.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she used ballet, and the access it gave her, as a cover
for underground activities that included moving Jews to safe
houses.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Rodbell revisits the same Dutch streets she had
traversed under the cover of darkness, carefully explaining how she
carried bags of partisan newspapers, often to people she never saw,
and how she lied to German officers to cross bridges and roads
closed to Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Hungary, Shulamit Lack was also working to save
her kin. Like Rodbell and Schulman, she saved many but was unable
to save her own family.
</P>
<P>
   A rebellious teen from the start, Lack responded to schoolyard
anti-Semitism by rejecting her family's Hungarian pride and joining
a Zionist youth movement.
</P>
<P>
   She begged her parents to leave Hungary for the safety of
Palestine. As she arranged false travel papers for dozens and
skirted Jews across the border into Romania, she begged her own
parents to leave Hungary. Her mother refused, and when the Nazis
captured Budapest in 1944, she was sent to Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   Testimonials often bring a certain comfort to outsiders in
knowing that, despite the most inhumane circumstances, the
storyteller has somehow survived.
</P>
<P>
   So is the case with ''Daring to Resist.'' Despite the sheer
horror and loneliness of their young lives, all three have grown
old and gray in comfortable homes. Rodbell has been in New York
since 1947. Lack also made New York her home, after 15 years in
Israel. Schulman moved to Canada in 1948, after two years in a
displaced persons camp.

<HEADLINE> Details of the Yugoslav Elections  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Details of Yugoslav presidential, parliamentary and
local
elections held Sunday:
<TEXT>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS:
</P>
<P>
   -- For the first time, voters in the Yugoslav federation -- Serbia
and Montenegro -- were directly electing the president. Previously,
the president was chosen by the Yugoslav parliament.
</P>
<P>
   In independent polls, incumbent Milosevic was trailing
opposition candidate Vojislav Kostunica heading into the election.
Three other candidates were also running, but with little chance.
</P>
<P>
   If no candidate acquires a simple majority of the turnout
figure, a runoff of the two first-round leaders will be held two
weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   -- In Montenegro, where the parliament boycotted the voting, and
Kosovo, polling stations were set up in shops and private homes by
Milosevic supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   FEDERAL ELECTIONS:
</P>
<P>
   -- Upper House of Parliament, or Chamber of Republics: Voters in
Serbia and Montenegro were selecting 20 legislators from each
republic to the 40-seat chamber.
</P>
<P>
   -- Lower House of Parliament, or Chamber of Citizens: Voters in
Serbia elect 108 deputies and Montenegrin voters 30 deputies to the
138-seat lower house.
</P>
<P>
   -- For lower house races, electoral districts have been redrawn
to allot Serbia 26 districts instead of the previous 29 while
Montenegro remains a single election district.
</P>
<P>
   -- Three election districts previously covering the territory of
Kosovo were merged with two other districts in southern Serbia.
Kosovo's 1 million ethnic Albanians boycotted the election.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   LOCAL ELECTIONS:
</P>
<P>
   -- Local elections were being held only in Serbia, as Montenegro
boycotted the vote.
</P>
<P>
   -- Voters in municipalities, towns and cities were electing their
governments and local assembly deputies. The majority of Serbia's
towns and cities are currently run by Milosevic's opponents, who
won the last local ballot in November 1996.
</P>
<P>
   -- Balloting also took place for the assembly of Vojvodina,
Serbia's northern province with a substantial Hungarian minority.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   All races are decided by a simple majority regardless of the
turnout.

<HEADLINE> Kostunica Eyed as Serbia's Savior  </HEADLINE>
By KATARINA KRATOVAC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Nothing in the demeanor of President
Slobodan Milosevic's main challenger reflects the daunting task he
has undertaken: to defeat one of the world's last autocratic
leaders and halt more than a decade of national decline.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Vojislav Kostunica, the opposition candidate for
Yugoslavia's top job, has done what seemed impossible in the run-up
to Sunday's general elections -- rekindled hope for a future without
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica's campaign convoy zigzagged Yugoslavia's main republic
Serbia, trekking more than 3,000 miles and electrifying crowds at
every stop.
</P>
<P>
   When 150,000 people flooded Belgrade's main square last week,
gone were the former law professor's monotones. Instead, his clear
voice ignited many to chant with passion: ''Kostunica, save us from
this madhouse!''
</P>
<P>
   ''May God help us to have enough courage and enough wisdom to
win freedom,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Although every independent poll had him in the lead, Kostunica
was skeptical before Sunday that Milosevic will actually step down,
even if he loses the ballot. Kostunica warned that the regime was
scheming to rig the elections and -- if needed -- use force to secure
Milosevic's political survival.
</P>
<P>
   An unlikely presidential candidate in the turbulent Balkans,
where charismatic leaders are idolized, the down-to-earth
Kostunica's attraction is hard to define. He is low-key and
unassuming. His honesty is probably what warmed the hearts of
average citizens outraged by endemic corruption and the regime's
record of bloodshed and wars.
</P>
<P>
   The no-frills Kostunica, 56, pursued an academic career until he
was kicked out of Belgrade Law School in 1974 for his
anti-communist stance.
</P>
<P>
   Active in Serbia's fledgling opposition movement in early 1990s,
Kostunica founded his own Democratic Party of Serbia in 1992 and
has led it since. He lives with wife Zorica, a fellow law school
graduate, in a middle-class Belgrade apartment. The couple have two
cats and a dog.
</P>
<P>
   When Milosevic called general elections this summer, an alliance
of 18 opposition parties -- the Democratic Opposition of Serbia --
picked Kostunica to run against Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   His personal and political consistency and his Serb patriotism
endear him to the man on the street.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where NATO bombings last year are still fresh in
people's minds, Kostunica has been careful to keep a distance from
the West, while cautioning that this nation must ''make its peace
with Europe and the world.''
</P>
<P>
   On Kosovo, he has promised to do his best to stand by the
province's Serb minority and work for the return of many of the
200,000 who left out of fear of the Albanian majority.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic a Career Politician  </HEADLINE>
By DUSAN STOJANOVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Unflinching defiance and an unerring
instinct for staying in power have characterized President Slobodan
Milosevic's turbulent and sometimes bloody decade in power.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Milosevic was facing a highly popular opposition
candidate, Vojislav Kostunica, who was way ahead in independent
public opinion polls. Yet there were widespread fears that
Milosevic will -- as he has done in all previous elections -- rig the
vote, or even use force to stay in power.
</P>
<P>
   The 59-year-old Milosevic was born in Pozarevac, an industrial
city central Serbia, to a father who was a theologist and a mother
who was a teacher. They both committed suicide in his youth.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Belgrade law school in 1964, Milosevic
joined the Communist Party, the traditional avenue to power in
communist Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   He moved up the career ladder, holding various business
positions until 1983 when he was appointed director of Beobanka,
one of the major state-run banks.
</P>
<P>
   After orchestrating a 1987 putsch against his mentor, Serbian
Communist Party leader Ivan Stambolic, Milosevic used his political
power base to expand his influence. Stambolic was abducted in
Belgrade a month ago and has not been seen since.
</P>
<P>
   Exploiting Serb nationalism when Yugoslavia's gradual
disintegration began, Milosevic became Serbia's president in 1989
by advocating the Serbian supremacy that would fuel wars in
Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia -- and ultimately in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   He exploited legal loopholes to remain in power. Prevented by
the constitution from another term as president, Milosevic simply
switched offices, becoming the president of Yugoslavia -- which
includes Serbia and Montenegro -- in 1997 and endowing that
previously toothless position with unlimited authority.
</P>
<P>
   When his term in office was about to expire, he changed the
constitution in July to have Yugoslav presidents elected by popular
vote for up to two, four-year terms.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic was brutal in putting down early challenges, calling
out Yugoslav army tanks in 1991 to disperse opposition
demonstrations. Later, as international pressure intensified, he
thrived on the opposition's disarray, weathering months of
demonstrations in 1996 and 1997 to emerge as strong as ever.
</P>
<P>
   In all the conflicts, his message has been the same: The world
is united against Serbia and Serbs must resist.
</P>
<P>
   That message has worn thinner as economic distress, caused by
international sanctions and economic mismanagement, grew in
Yugoslavia and Serbia, the larger of Yugoslavia's two remaining
republics.
</P>
<P>
   If the splintered opposition had united in a joint bloc against
him, Milosevic, now supported by only about a quarter of Serbs,
would have been out a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   But last year's NATO war against Yugoslavia over Kosovo
strengthened his hand again as Serbs took it as the ultimate
evidence of the world's conspiracy against them.
</P>
<P>
   Almost totally isolated at home and abroad, Milosevic's closest
counsel is his hard-line wife, Mira Markovic, 58, whose withering
diatribes against the West have set the tone for Sunday's
elections.
</P>
<P>
   They have two troublesome children -- daughter Marija, 35, who
runs a radio and television station, and son Marko, 26, a disco
owner and race car enthusiast with rumored business ties with the
underworld.

<HEADLINE> Boy Scout donations down amid controversy over exclusion of gays  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MERIDEN, Conn. (AP) - The Connecticut Yankee Council of the Boy
Scouts of America says it has lost about $50,000 in donations
because of the controversy over the organization's exclusion of
gays.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Krofina, executive director of the council which oversees
20,000 scouts in southern Connecticut, said United Ways in Branford
and Westport/Weston and one corporate donor he declined to identify
have cut their funding.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is the same across the state and nation as charity
groups struggle with an issue that has polarized people inside and
outside of scouting.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, the state's Commission on Human Rights and
Opportunities tried to drop the Scouts from its state employee
contribution campaign on the basis that the Scouts's hiring policy
violates state discrimination laws. But the Scouts sued and won.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's office awaits word of a possible appeal
from the agency and the 22 statewide United Ways are watching the
case, said Jack Brooks, executive director of the
Meriden-Wallingford United Way.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to do the right thing. We don't want to pull funds
from a program that does a great job with kids, but we have to
consider our contributors,'' Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, United Ways have sought commitments from local
councils that the policy won't be enforced in local troops.
</P>
<P>
   Boy Scout councils in Rhode Island and Minnesota petitioned
national leaders to reconsider the ban because of their loss of
funding, Krofina said.
</P>
<P>
   The Scouts' backers say the private organization has a right to
a certain standard for members, a position supported by the U.S.
Supreme Court in a June ruling over the dismissal of a New Jersey
scoutmaster who is gay.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the Scouts, and anyone who funds them, are
supporting discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Krofina said if the shortfall is not made up, programs will
suffer, particularly in urban areas where outreach is most
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been twisted as an issue of being anti-gay, which is not
the case. Any organization has the right to define its mission,''
he said. ''If the atheists were more organized than the gay and
lesbian organizations, the current discussion would be on the
belief in God.''
</P>
<P>
   Krofina said a positive sign is that enrollment is increasing.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a sign that people agree with us,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Putin Bringing Stability to Russia  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA CHARLTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Despite a fiasco over a sunken submarine and a
feud over control of the media, President Vladimir Putin has
brought a fragile political stability to his unwieldy nation,
replacing the chaos that paralyzed Russia for much of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Since he was elected six months ago, the former spy has
confounded critics' predictions that his administration would
succumb to the corruption that stained Boris Yeltsin's tenure or
smother Russia's nascent democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet observers warn that Putin's position is precarious. Poverty
and crime remain pervasive. Putin has stressed the need to tackle
the problems that matter most to the majority of Russians -- poverty
and unemployment. But the economy remains in deep trouble and the
government has yet to come up with a strategy to revive the economy
beyond promises to continue market reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people believe in Putin. But they cannot wait forever. He
must show through real actions that wages will always be paid on
time, and that they will someday grow, and that the country has
become safer than before,'' said Andrei Ryabov of Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has pushed through tax reforms and nuclear arms control
pacts that snagged under Yeltsin. He has brought autocratic
regional leaders to heel. While trying to revive Russia's
international influence, he has been realistic in admitting that
Moscow can't afford to be a superpower and has begun to trim the
bloated military. He has charmed foreign leaders and wooed Western
investors -- and let a 10-year-old Japanese girl toss him on a judo
mat.
</P>
<P>
   Political stability also has been boosted by major changes in
parliament, where centrist parties recently ended the domination of
the Communists, who fought Yeltsin and reform for years, often
deadlocking the government.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups paint a darker picture. They say the
security services under Putin have covered up atrocities in
Chechnya and persecuted minorities, environmentalists and
journalists. They are wary of Putin's KGB background and note that
he rose to power with the help of the scandal-tinged Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Putin remains Russia's most popular politician. His
ratings barely dipped amid criticism of his bungled reaction to the
Kursk submarine disaster last month. Clearly surprised by public
anger over the Kursk, Putin showed himself more sensitive to public
opinion than any other modern Russian leader.
</P>
<P>
   Support for Putin has come from broadly differing camps --
including renowned dissident writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn,
persecuted by the Soviet KGB that Putin served for 15 years, and
former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
   Solzhenitsyn said after meeting with Putin this week, ''the
president has an excellent understanding of the incredible
difficulties ... which he has inherited.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin has ''a lively mind and a quick imagination, he has no
personal thirst for power or intoxication with power,'' said
Solzhenitsyn, who has derided almost every other Russian politician
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev said recently that he had observed ''a change for the
better'' since Putin came to power.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's loudest opponents are two tycoons, Boris Berezovsky and
Vladimir Gusinsky, who accuse him of cracking down on the media --
and are using TV networks they control, ORT and NTV, to air their
complaints. Independent journalists also say Putin's government and
security services pressure the media, a charge Putin denies.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian public has largely sided with Putin in this debate.
That's because Berezovsky and Gusinsky represent a class of
superrich, well-connected -- and widely reviled -- businessmen who
built empires through shady privatization deals in the 1990s and
who came to represent the worst excesses of the Yeltsin years.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has vowed to end the political power of these so-called
oligarchs, and to tackle the corruption that bedevils Russian life.
Russian media reports suggest Putin may fire Prime Minister Mikhail
Kasyanov, who some say is too oligarch-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's success or failure in tackling corruption will be a key
test of his presidency. For all his early talk, little has been
done to take on government corruption. Nor have there been any
major moves against the organized crime that grips large parts of
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say Putin remains popular because he hasn't faced
any major challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been lucky,'' said Yevgeny Volk, director of the Heritage
Foundation Moscow office.
</P>
<P>
   The economy is buoyed by high world prices for oil, Russia's top
export commodity, but a drop could leave the government scrambling
to pay wages and pensions in a painful encore of the Yeltsin years.
And the year-old war in Chechnya, which Russians initially cheered,
is dragging on with no end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Sympathetic observers say Putin, who never before held elected
office, is still finding his footing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Russia has already left the Yeltsin road but doesn't know
where to go next,'' Ryabov said.

<HEADLINE> Fall TV Season Pushed Back  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It's late September. The air is crisper,
footballs are flying and after months of reruns, television viewers
are finally rewarded with new shows and returning favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Well, at least two out of the three are true this year.
</P>
<P>
   Fall is arriving a little late in TV land. And between the
Olympics, baseball and presidential debates, television executives
are wondering if viewers will have much of a chance this season to
settle into old habits and create new ones.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the planets are aligned to make us run for the
Pepto-Bismol and the Tums,'' said Preston Beckman, executive vice
president of strategic programming at Fox.
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of ABC, CBS and Fox, Nielsen Media Research pushed
the official starting date of the new TV season back two weeks to
Oct. 2. Since NBC is dominating prime-time now with the Olympics,
their rivals felt it would give NBC an unfair head start for
ratings bragging rights for the season.
</P>
<P>
   With no meaningful incentive to compete against the Olympics,
most networks have held back their new material. The exceptions are
the mini-networks (UPN, the WB and Pax TV), which have rolled out
some new shows to entice bored channel surfers.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just when the networks were ready to get rolling on Oct.
2, the first presidential debate was scheduled for Oct. 3 and the
vice presidential debate for two nights later.
</P>
<P>
   Some quick shuffling ensued: NBC's prized Thursday night lineup
pushed back its season premieres to Oct. 12. The CBS hit, ''Judging
Amy,'' was delayed for a week, and so was ABC's new sitcom starring
Geena Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has chosen not to cover the debates. But since it is
broadcasting baseball playoffs and the World Series, some of its
most popular programs won't appear with new episodes until
November, including ''The X-Files,'' ''The Simpsons'' and ''Malcolm
in the Middle.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC is also covering the baseball playoffs, which has prevented
''Providence'' from starting until Oct. 20 and ''Frasier'' until
Oct. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers may not be that confused about NBC's schedule, since it
is able to promote its programs relentlessly during the Olympics.
Its rivals don't have that luxury. Fox, for instance, is buying
more billboard space and radio ads because it can't count on many
viewers during the Olympics weeks, Beckman said.
</P>
<P>
   But in this post-''Survivor'' era, the fall TV premiere season --
an institution as old as television itself -- may be becoming an
anachronism anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ''More and more, the networks are moving toward a year-round
program development strategy,'' said Bob Flood, senior vice
president at the advertising firm Optimedia International.
</P>
<P>
   Take the two TV sensations of the past year: ''Survivor'' was a
summer series, starting in late May and climaxing in August. ''Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire'' debuted in August 1999 and didn't join
ABC's regular schedule until the following January.
</P>
<P>
   Midseason can often be a launching pad for hits, such as
''Providence'' and ''Malcolm in the Middle.'' Networks are more apt
to try new shows at any point in the year now.
</P>
<P>
   Some producers of new programs actually prefer to start anytime
but the fall, since it's easier in autumn for their shows to get
lost in the avalanche of new things and be overlooked by viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly influential cable networks don't live by the same
schedule. HBO's ''Sex and the City'' is a summer series, and ''The
Sopranos'' won't start up again until next March. Some cable
networks save their high-profile programming for when the
broadcasters go on a break: June is usually premiere month for
Comedy Central.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Beckman isn't ready to give up the old way of doing
things.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the odds of a new fall series becoming a hit are
long, they are historically better than shows that start at other
times of the year, he said. Broadcasters tend to save for midseason
programs that they didn't think were quite good enough for the fall
schedule, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a cycle to the seasons and the viewers still look to
the networks in September for new material, just like cars are
introduced at a certain time,'' Beckman said. ''It's the time of
the year when people are used to seeing the goods that the networks
have. They are sensitive to it. They're attuned to it.''
</P>
<P>
   With summer over and the nights getting longer, people naturally
gravitate to spending more time in front of the tube.
</P>
<P>
   The television business is built around the announcement of a
new fall schedule each spring, and the resulting rush of
advertisers to buy commercial time. Even though networks are slowly
becoming more cognizant of keeping their audiences happy throughout
the year, that structure isn't likely to change.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, viewers, be patient. The reruns WILL end
eventually.

<HEADLINE> Many In Kosovo Stopped From Voting  </HEADLINE>
By ELENA BECATOROS
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- With U.S. and other
peacekeepers discreetly watching, Kosovo Serbs voted Sunday in
Yugoslav elections marred by confusion and irregularities that the
opposition said were aimed at bolstering President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   In several areas visited by reporters, Kosovo Serbs went to
polling stations that never opened. Others were given no privacy to
mark their ballots or were turned away because their names did not
appear on registration lists.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they create so much confusion, it is better for them so
they can manipulate the vote,'' said Dragisan Djokovic, head of the
local branch of the main Serb opposition party.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Milosevic's Socialist Party denied any systematic
attempt to deprive people of their right to vote. A Socialist Party
official here, Zdravko Trajkovic, said confusion was a result of
problems bringing election materials into the province.
</P>
<P>
   He said many Kosovo Serbs had lost their documents in the
turmoil of the Kosovo conflict and had failed to register. He also
said there may have been a few cases where deceased people remained
on the voting rolls because their deaths had not been recorded yet.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, irregularities were not limited to this Serb
stronghold 30 miles northwest of the Kosovo capital Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   In Caglavica, one of Kosovo's most prominent Serbs, Momcilo
Trajkovic, was refused permission to vote because his name was not
on the registration rolls. Trajkovic, a lifelong resident of the
area, supports Milosevic's main challenger, Vojislav Kostunica.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course I wanted to vote,'' said Jelica Markovic, 25,
another lifelong Caglavica resident who was turned away. ''It's not
right that they should say I don't have the right to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is considered critical to any attempt by Milosevic's
government to rig the election, because the lack of a proper census
here in years makes it difficult to determine the actual number of
potential voters.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N.-led administration allowed balloting in the province
since it remains part of Yugoslavia despite international
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population,
stayed away and Kouchner said ''any claim of participation by
Kosovo Albanians is a fiction or manipulation.''
</P>
<P>
   In the American sector, U.S. troops were told to stay near the
polling stations but far enough away to show they were not
sanctioning the vote. Western officials didn't want peacekeepers to
appear in photographs, fearing that would make it seem if they
approved of the balloting.

<HEADLINE> Hospitals gear up for upcoming flu season  </HEADLINE>
dchfcsy
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The state's hospitals may be ill-prepared
to handle the upcoming flu season, as health care officials face a
nursing shortage, a delay in delivery of the flu vaccine and
hospitals that are unusually full.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's flu season typically begins between Thanksgiving
and Christmas and peaks in January or February, said Dr. Matthew
Cartter, the state Department of Health's epidemiology program
coordinator. He said an early start to flu season would be
difficult to handle.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're all hoping for the flu season doesn't start any earlier
than usual,'' Cartter said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steven Wolf, director of New Britain General Hospital's
emergency department, said the state's nursing shortage has grown
worse in the past year, making it harder for hospitals to handle a
big increase in flu patients this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the problem is that delivery of this year's influenza
vaccine to doctors' offices and pharmacies has been delayed because
of manufacturing problems. The federal Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention is not sure yet whether there will be a shortage
this season.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC wants more people to get flu shots. The agency
recommended in April that everyone 50 and older get flu shots. It
previously had urged Americans 65 and older to get vaccinated.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20,000 people die of flu complications every year in the
United States. Most of them are old, chronically ill or both.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's flu season was difficult for Connecticut's
hospitals. Many of them were near capacity and had to occasionally
divert ambulances to other hospitals. The nursing shortage, fewer
hospital beds and other illnesses added to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The state Office of Health Care Access and the Connecticut
Hospital Association are prepared to help the state's hospitals
cope with crowding problems and the channeling of patients to other
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals are preparing by anticipating higher demand.
</P>
<P>
   Hartford Hospital recently expanded its number of staffed beds
by 20, with another 28 to be added in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   St. Francis Hospital and Medical Center in Hartford also is
getting ready to treat the flu.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are planning that we will have a large number of admissions
to the hospital,'' said Dr. Jose Missri, chairman of the medicine
department and senior vice president for medical affairs at St.
Francis. ''We're planning to make sure we're ready to handle
that.''

<HEADLINE> State promoting revamped college savings program  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   The state has slashed fees and increased promotion of
a college
savings program in an effort to get more Connecticut parents to
invest for their children.
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are more than half a million pre-college age children in
Connecticut, but fewer than 8,500 of them have accounts through the
Connecticut Higher Education Trust Fund.
</P>
<P>
   State Treasurer Denise Nappier hopes the new changes will make
the 3-year-old program a bigger draw.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do expect there are a lot of people out there who, if they
only knew about the program, would be investing,'' said Donald
Kirshbaum, an investment officer for Nappier's office.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Voigt, of New Haven, learned of the program like most
parents, when a flyer was sent to her home by a state
representative. Nappier wants the information given to new parents
at hospitals and potential parents at pediatrician's offices.
</P>
<P>
   The trust fund program, reopened for new accounts in March after
the state hired a new manager, offers a tax-deferred means of
saving for college.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new managers, TIAA-CREF Tuition Financing Inc. of New
York, fees have been cut in half to up to 81 cents annually on each
$100 invested. An annual account fee of $15 was eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Now, instead of a startup investment of $500, accounts can be
opened for $25 - $15 if through a payroll deduction plan.
</P>
<P>
   The benefit of CHET, said Nappier, is that state taxes on
interest earned are eliminated and federal taxes are deferred until
the money is withdrawn. The fund is handled by a professional money
manager with access to a sophisticated assortment of mutual funds,
stocks and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Account holders can use the funds to pay for tuition at any
accredited post-secondary school in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we're on the verge of there being an explosion of
these programs in terms of growth and participation,'' said Mike
Noone, eastern regional director for TIAA-CREF.
</P>
<P>
   Starting next month, the state will launch a marketing campaign
to promote CHET, which in its new form received high marks from
SavingForCollege. com, a Web-based consulting company.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe we've positioned the fund to perform better,''
Nappier said.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut has about $63.3 million in assets and 8,349 accounts
in CHET. The program has grown by about 1,750 new accounts and
$12.5 million in deposits since March. By comparison,
Massachusetts' program has 24,000 accounts with $200 million
invested.
</P>
<P>
   The fund may not appeal to the more aggressive investors,
because investments grow according to a predetermined plan without
variation. The state is considering giving depositors more
aggressive and conservative investment options.
</P>
<P>
   ''For someone who's not going to put the money away any other
way, who's not good at investing or who doesn't enjoy investing,
it's probably a very good idea,'' said Peter Nagle, a financial
advisor with Fairfield Financial Group. ''But you'd have to weigh
the advantages of going that route versus investing it yourself and
possibly getting a better rate of return.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Voigt, whose youngest daughter is a high school
freshman, the fund is perfect. She makes deposits through payroll
deductions and doesn't even have to think about it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish I had both the time and the knowledge (to invest on her
own) but right now, all it could do is make me nervous,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Report: 40 States to forfeit health care funds meant for poor children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Forty states may have to give up hundreds of
millions of dollars of federal money earmarked for health insurance
for children in low-income families because they haven't used all
their allotted funds, The New York Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   About 45 percent of the $4.2 billion provided in 1997 by
Congress hasn't been spent by the states, state and federal
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Any money left after a Sept. 30 deadline will be redistributed
to the 10 states that used their full allotments of federal money
under the Children's Health Insurance Program, a program created by
Congress in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   For Louisiana, that would mean giving up $63.7 million, or 63
percent of its allotment of $101.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   California and Texas - which together have 29 percent of the
nation's 11 million uninsured children - stand to lose $590 million
and $446.3 million, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The states that have used all of their allotments - Alaska,
Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, New York, North
Carolina, Pennsylvania and South Carolina - will have one year to
spend the extra money, after which it will revert to the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Health Insurance Program was designed to help
children in families with too much income to qualify for Medicaid
and too little to afford private insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Congress in 1997 committed to providing a total of $40 billion
for the program nationwide over 10 years. States had three years
beginning Oct. 1, 1997, to use the first year's installment of $4.2
billion.
</P>
<P>
   State officials say the program provides care to more than two
million children while stimulating improvements in Medicaid. But
spending has lagged behind expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in 20 states say they encountered major problems
implementing the program because in some cases it took more than a
year to start enrollment; some states couldn't find enough eligible
children, and others said the complex application procedure
deterred enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we enrolled every single eligible child in Colorado, we
still couldn't spend our full allocation of federal money. Our
economy is doing so well, there are fewer eligible kids than what
was estimated when the federal government did its initial
allocation of money,'' said William N. Lindsay, head of the board
that supervises the program in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Some states complained that the federal government administered
the program in such a rigid, inflexible way that it prevented them
from spending the money for children who might have benefited.
</P>
<P>
   ''The federal law and regulations provided New Mexico with a lot
more money than we could possibly use,'' complained J. Barry
Blitzer, deputy secretary of the Human Services Department in New
Mexico. ''We have 30,000 uninsured kids, of whom no more than 1,000
are eligible for the new program.''

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky To Host British TV Show  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky, whose affair with President
Clinton made her a celebrity in the United States, will be
reporting on American culture for a British television network, her
publicist said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The former White House intern has agreed to host six 4-minute
segments dubbed ''Postcards from Monica'' for Britain's Channel 5,
according to Juli Nadler, Lewinsky's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Nadler said the segments would be a ''lighthearted look at
American pop culture for British viewers.'' She declined to say how
much Lewinsky would be paid.
</P>
<P>
   Though the segments will air in November, Lewinsky won't be
reporting on the United States' major event of that month -- the
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ''Monica's agreement with ITN, Channel 5, stipulates what has
always been her position -- that she refuses to make any public
comment on any political issues, including the U.S. elections,''
Nadler said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's affair with Lewinsky led to his impeachment trial last
year in the Senate. He was acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Since the scandal, Lewinsky has written a book and has started
her own line of handbags.

<HEADLINE> Professor advocates easy design changes for fading eyes  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN BREZOSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The twin 10-story towers are pure 1970s
senior housing project, looming bleakly over an unfinished parking
garage and the stylish downtown McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   But inside the towers, an experiment in bright and cheery is
underway. In keeping with the latest research on home lighting for
the elderly, light is abundant, and in all the right places.
</P>
<P>
   ''There're lights everywhere - on the counters, in the bathroom
- it's wonderful,'' said 88-year-old resident Ellen Schofield.
''I'm legally blind since I had my stroke. Before, I stumbled a
bit, couldn't find all my plug-ins.''
</P>
<P>
   In each building's common area, an electric skylight mimics
sunlight, making a perfect reading area for the up-at-5 a.m. set.
Corridor ceiling lights are set off-center and diffused by louvers
to eliminate shadows that to some older eyes appear like water
puddles.
</P>
<P>
   The notice board gets noticed, manager Tim Dormady says, thanks
to fixtures that light the board itself while diffusing sources of
glare. The same principle is put to work above the office counter,
where tenants tend to write their rent checks. All rave about
lights under kitchen counters that allow them to read recipes and
medicine bottles. More compliment the lights in the showers.
</P>
<P>
   South Mall Towers is a study site for the Lighting Research
Center at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy. The lighting
concepts are the same as being used at its more upscale sister
project in Simsbury, Conn., high-quality light is maximized to come
from key objects while minimized from other sources.
</P>
<P>
   For both projects at least partial funding came from sources
vested in saving energy, in New York's case the New York State
Energy Research and Development Authority. Energy costs at South
Mall are kept down by dimmers and light sensors. ''This isn't high
end; this isn't the sort of thing that only the Rockefellers could
afford,'' said Peter Boyce, an RPI professor who oversaw the
project along with lighting designer Naomi Miller. ''It's the
basic, routine, thing that you could apply anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   By age 60, the average eye has two and a half times less
contrasting ability than it did at age 20. By 86, that ability is
one-fifth. Dr. Alan Lewis, president of the New England College of
Optometry, likens it to a computer screen with both brightness and
contrast nodes turned down.
</P>
<P>
   Lenses grow thicker, more opaque, and increasingly specked with
protein deposits or other debris that Lewis said ''can be like
trying to see a movie in a movie theater with the lights on.''
</P>
<P>
   As less light is reflected back from the eye, colors blur, and
the world takes on a yellowish hue. Like light playing off a pair
of smudged eyeglasses, scattering light causes a sometimes painful
glare. It's a big reason many elderly find driving at night
intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Safety Council, eight out of 10 of
those killed by falls are over age 65, and falls are the leading
cause of injury-related death among the very elderly, those over
age 80. Falls are also the leading cause of injury and hospital
admission for older adults.
</P>
<P>
   The second floor corridor of South Mall Towers, only half
retrofitted, provides a study in contrast. The old half is lit by
square lamps lined along the center of the ceiling. Said Miller,
''the glare smears everything you see, bounces light off walls,
shadows, pools.'' The light along the retrofitted half is
noticeably more uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Light is key in regulating the body's internal clock, or
circadian rhythm, and stimulates production of melatonin, a hormone
that affects sleep. Studies have shown that some light-deprived
nursing home residents wake up and fall asleep as many as 37 times
a night, and often suffer from depression as well.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon is already mandating that lighting recommendations be
followed in nursing homes, and researchers say they hope
requirements are established nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the growth of our aging population it's going to be more
and more of a concern,'' said Eunice Noell-Waggoner of the
Portland, Ore.-based Center of Design for an Aging Society.
</P>
<P>
   Better lighting, she said, is a simple measure that allows the
elderly to maintain their independence and better their sense of
well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Said Boyce, ''none of this is going to restore visual powers to
a 20-year-old's, but it makes life easier.''

<HEADLINE> Philippine Farmers Caught in Battles  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALIPAO, Philippines (AP) -- Coconut farmer Ullah Saddaramil was
watching military planes bombard rebel camps in the mountains of
southern Jolo island when soldiers chasing a suspected rebel
accidentally shot him, his wife and two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Only Saddaramil survived the attack in Talipao, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got caught in the fighting,'' Saddaramil said from his
hospital bed, the back of his head swollen from a bullet wound and
his eyes welling with tears.
</P>
<P>
   Despite attempts by the military to play down the costs to
civilians of a massive assault aiming to free 19 hostages held by
Muslim guerrillas, witness accounts indicate many villagers have
been caught in the cross fire.
</P>
<P>
   Anni Mohamad was playing in front of his house when a Philippine
air force plane dropped three bombs nearby, showering this tiny
coastal village with shrapnel and debris.
</P>
<P>
   Shrapnel pierced the 11-year-old boy's hip, and he collapsed to
the ground. Three of his playmates also were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting has forced 14,000 people to flee their homes,
overcrowding evacuation centers, says the military, which has
tightly controlled information. But military officials insist only
two civilians have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   Nelsa Amin, a provincial health official, said villagers have
been afraid to report deaths caused by the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''They refuse to provide names or details,'' she said. ''We are
expecting more casualties but we cannot enter some areas. We need
military permission.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of government troops launched the rescue attempt Sept.
16 on Jolo, an impoverished island at the country's southern tip.
</P>
<P>
   Two French journalists escaped last week while their captors
fled the assault. An American, three Malaysians and 13 Filipinos
are still believed to be held.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf rebels say they are fighting for a separate
Islamic state in the southern Philippines, but the government
regards them as bandits.
</P>
<P>
   Since March, the rebels have seized scores of hostages,
including 21 tourists and workers taken from a Malaysian resort on
April 23. Most have been released, with Libya and Malaysia
reportedly paying more than $15 million to free 19 foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of troops backed by attack helicopters closed in
Sunday on rebels fleeing with the American hostage in the hills of
Jolo, officials said. The Abu Sayyaf rebels holding Jeffrey
Schilling, 24, of Oakland, Calif., were attempting to reach a beach
to escape from the island, Vice Governor Munib Estino said.
</P>
<P>
   The government halted talks with the rebels and attacked after
the guerrillas kidnapped more people despite a promise to halt
abductions while negotiations were under way.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the rebels, whose hide-outs were located mostly in the
areas of Talipao and Patikul, fled shortly before the assault
began. Villagers living near rebel areas had little warning.
</P>
<P>
   In Ipil, about 100 residents gathered in a village hall for
protection from the assault. Instead, a plane dropped three bombs
that exploded in the sea nearby, sending the villagers fleeing,
local officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Ipil is now a ghost village, with many of its houses and stores
looted and most of its residents in evacuation centers, said Ida
Mohamad, a 30-year-old mother of six.
</P>
<P>
   The hardships have been compounded by the military's decision to
cut most communications and transportation links with the island in
an effort to contain the fleeing guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The military also has attempted to bar journalists from
traveling to Jolo.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Jolo residents have been virtually cut off from the
rest of the world. Local officials later pressured the military to
allow telephone calls from public calling stations and provide
transportation for civilians aboard military ships and planes.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is practically an undeclared martial law,'' said Alsad
Alfad Jr., director of the island's Office of Muslim Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the military allowed local officials to deliver
rice, food and medicine to evacuation centers in Talipao, one of
the hardest-hit areas. At least two villages in Talipao were
entirely razed by fire during the attack, police said.
</P>
<P>
   At a grade school compound-turned-emergency shelter in Talipao's
Bilaan village, 15-year-old Nurain Isin guarded five siblings
sitting on a mat dampened by a drizzle. A rice sack and a sheet of
tin propped up by branches served as a roof.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very difficult,'' Nurain said.

<P>
   Around her shelter, flies swarmed on trash, leftover food and
piles of unwashed plastic plates and pots and pans blackened by
wood fires. A baby beside her fidgeted, irritated by the flies.
</P>
<P>
   Near the school, hundreds of heavily armed marines and soldiers
stood guard and patrolled. Muddied armored personnel carriers
rumbled along a nearby road.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hardships, many Jolo residents support the assault
against the rebels who have harassed the island for years, but hope
the violence will end soon so they can resume their normal lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we're successful we could end the violence in our land once
and for all,'' said Asani Tammang, a congressman from Jolo. ''When
there is peace, we can start to rebuild.''

<HEADLINE> Homeless AIDS advocates wish federal aid could match medical innovations </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE WATSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - They carry their life's possessions on withering
backs and hide death within their broken bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Some spent an entire lifetime on the streets, searching for a
home under a molding cardboard box in a trash-strewn alleyway.
Others are teens who ran from something but stumbled into a life
far worse; they trade sex for a night in a bed. Still more believe
their luck has run out after recently losing jobs, apartments and
friends.
</P>
<P>
   But every day, a small handful of the thousands of homeless men
and women living with AIDS in New York City make a tremendous
effort rarely taken by their brethren. They seek help. They fight
for life, no matter the inevitable future.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists haven't cured HIV or AIDS, but their powerful drug
concoctions that keep people alive longer create a curious problem.
Public and non-profit agencies already struggle to pay for their
existing cases. Now they wonder: How can we possibly help the new
people infected with the virus?
</P>
<P>
   ''Today, people think the epidemic is over,'' said Gina
Quattrochi, the president of the National AIDS Housing Coalition
and the executive director at Bailey House, a private center in
Greenwich Village helping homeless AIDS survivors. ''The reality is
people are living much longer, but the vast majority are
disabled.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Congress is debating next year's budget. Advocates
like Quattrochi requested increasing the $232 million budget by $60
million - and were worried when President Clinton proposed upping
it to just $260 million. Disappointment has turned to fear because
Senate leaders don't want to increase the appropriation at all.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's thin. We have to get it up,'' said U.S. Rep. Jerrold
Nadler, D-N.Y., a longtime supporter of homeless AIDS services who
pushed the House to propose increasing funds to $250 million.
''This country is rolling in money.''
</P>
<P>
   Expending millions of dollars for AIDS-exclusive assistance
meets resistance in every case.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has always been pressure from the far right to portray
it for drug addicts and queers,'' Quattrochi said, adding that
others question the need to fund specific AIDS housing when so much
housing is already available.
</P>
<P>
   Quattrochi says only half of Bailey House's residents are gay or
lesbian. She noted that at least 450,000 Americans with AIDS need
housing, and that's a conservative estimate because some haven't
learned they have the illness or are mentally ill and may never
know.
</P>
<P>
   New York, the city that served 1,200 homeless people with AIDS
in 1988, now assists more than 27,000. That total is steadily
increasing as it has for the past few years, said Ruth Reinecke, a
spokeswoman for the city's Division of AIDS Services.
</P>
<P>
   A Brooklyn federal judge's decision earlier this week shows the
city apparently hasn't adjusted well to the surging numbers. The
judge, who slammed the Division of AIDS Services for ''chronically
and systematically'' delaying or terminating assistance, ordered
the agency placed under federal oversight for three years. The city
plans to appeal the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Quattrochi says if members of Congress would look at operations
like Bailey House, they'd understand why advocates plead for more
money. The alternative, she says, is that health care costs will
soar when homeless AIDS patients seek treatment in emergency rooms,
which is more expensive than standard care. Emergency rooms also
don't offer AIDS patients the counseling that could help decrease
the spread of HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey House, one of many nonprofit groups that assist the city
in serving the homeless AIDS population, started when the virus was
first identified and it was still considered by many as
homosexuals' punishment from God. The 6 1/2-story building, set in
the primest of real estate along the Hudson River, nurtured
homeless AIDS survivors.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Bailey House added a vocational studies program because
clients lived longer thanks to the drug cocktails and weren't
interested in just wasting away. Three years later, Bailey House
opened the program to anyone with AIDS living in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to do something productive with my life,'' said Sean
Ransom, 31, who contracted the virus in the late 1980s and sought
help four years ago. ''I didn't want to ... take my meds and wait
to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Those medications - a triple combination of drugs - have doubled
the average time it takes for the HIV infection to develop into
AIDS, said Professsor Alvaro Munoz of Johns Hopkins University's
School of Public Health. They also increased the average survival
time of AIDS sufferers from 18 months to six years.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, residents in Bailey House stayed an average
of three months, and their stay almost always ended at a funeral
home. These days, they stay about three years, if not longer. Many
walk out on their own, often to Bailey House-assisted apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond treatment, stable housing is crucial to every patients'
health, Quattrochi says. Two-thirds of AIDS patients cite housing
as a top priority, just below medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Living on a friend's couch or moving between shelters, patients
find it difficult and tiring to get continual care; the effort
weakens the body and strengthens the disease - a deadly duo.
Patients also must live with failing organs and need refrigerators
to keep their medicine effective.
</P>
<P>
   Stable housing becomes a primal urge, Quattrochi says.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let me put it this way, what I always ask people is, 'Where do
you want to be when you have the flu?''' she said. ''You want to be
at home.''
</P>
<P>
   These problems become remote when a homeless person wakes up
after a night under crumbled, urine-stained newspapers.
Medications? It's doubtful they have any. It's often little better
in city-run shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Derryck, who declined to give his last name, lived in emergency
housing officially called Single Room Occupancy Units, but known by
residents as bare-boned welfare hotels.
</P>
<P>
   He could touch all four walls from the middle of his cubicle.
Occupants shared a single bathroom, and he shudders when
remembering the filth. Prostitutes, drugs, loan sharking, he
recalls, this place was a modern day Sodom and Gomorrah.
</P>
<P>
   And Derryck, who is 50, concedes he was lucky to live there.
''There's even a lack of bad housing,'' he said glumly.
</P>
<P>
   When the residents leave such rude accommodations, bare-boned is
the better description for the person, not the place.
</P>
<P>
   But Derryck found his way to Bailey House. Now he can sit on his
bed in his 85-square-foot home, with its view of the Hudson River,
watch TV, grab a snack - or his medications - from his mini-fridge,
or use his personal bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ''It works for me,'' he said with a grin as smooth jazz
sauntered out of his stereo's speakers. Behind him hung posters of
singer Bob Marley and a pink flamingo.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the window looked out onto the water. As he spoke,
a sailboat sliced through gusty winds as it cruised south heading
out into the open bay.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Sugar Makers Sweet on Profits  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEDRO BETANCOURT, Cuba (AP) -- With gray clouds spewing from
their smokestacks and an old-fashioned clang-clang-clang ringing
from their brass bells, six black steam engines led a weekend
celebration of the antiquated ''iron horses'' still used to carry
Cuba's sugar harvest.
</P>
<P>
   Local townsfolk and foreign train enthusiasts cheered Saturday
as the locomotives puffed down the tracks at the Cuba Libre sugar
mill, while an announcer told the story of these museums in motion.
</P>
<P>
   ''This,'' said the announcer, ''is history on parade.''
</P>
<P>
   While steam locomotives were common throughout Latin America in
the early 1900s, most were slowly retired over the decades and
replaced with diesel-powered engines.
</P>
<P>
   But 258 U.S. and British steam engines survive in Cuba, most of
them used in the winter to transport cut cane to sugar mills for
processing. The oldest steam locomotive in the world is here -- an
1878 American-made Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba's sugar mills -- and the old trains -- were once rarely seen
by foreigners as the communist government strictly limited access
to the state's economically crucial sugar producing centers.
</P>
<P>
   But that is starting to change, as officials in the sugar
industry, hit hard by falling prices, are beginning to discover the
potential for tourism in what once was strictly an agricultural
endeavor, said Roberto Perez, director of railroad transport for
Cuba's sugar industry.
</P>
<P>
   They also are starting to see the great interest that exists
around the world in the old-fashioned trains, which still transport
as much as 15 percent of Cuba's annual sugar harvest annually,
according to Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Among several hundred people at this weekend's ''Steam
Festival'' at the circa 1928 Cuba Libre mill, about 100 miles east
of Havana, probably half were railroad experts and enthusiasts from
across the Western Hemisphere who came to Cuba for last week's
conference of the Latin American Railroad Association.
</P>
<P>
   The railroad conference delegates were brought to the mill on
two large tour buses from the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are very few of these left in my country and those that
still exist are used for tourism,'' said Jorge Ricardez, an
Argentine railroad engineer, as he excitedly snapped pictures of a
black Baldwin locomotive with red and silver trim, manufactured in
Philadelphia in 1907.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a richness here, not only in the quantity of these
locomotives, but in their state of repair.'' said Ricardez. ''They
are maintained very, very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Sugar Ministry began offering a limited
number train trips around several of Cuba's mills to groups of
foreigners, said Perez. ''This is still just beginning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perez offered no figures on potential revenues for the Cuban
Sugar Ministry's incipient foray into the potentially lucrative
tourist trade.
</P>
<P>
   But the sugar industry, once the communist island's primary
source of income, lost several tens of millions of dollars earlier
this year because of lower sugar prices on the world market -- even
though the harvest was slightly better.
</P>
<P>
   And while sugar income has dropped, the tourism industry has
taken off, becoming the most important source of hard currency for
a country still recovering from the loss of its primary trading
partners in eastern Europe a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Sugar Ministry currently is talking with a Belgium firm,
Transnico, about organizing an expanded number of visits for the
coming year, said Daisy Rojas Valdes, a business specialist for the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists from Belgium, Britain and Japan are among those who
have spent their entire vacations in Cuba riding on trains around a
different sugar mill each day, Rojas said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Jose Smith Comas sugar mill in the central province of
Matanzas, the steam engines take turns transporting sugar
byproducts and enthusiastic train buffs from foreign countries,
said Raul Criolla, 47, a steam engine conductor who works there.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tourists always say they had wished the trip would have
been longer!'' said Criolla, who said he became a conductor because
''there was nothing else I ever wanted to be when I was a little
boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Criolla, who visited the Cuba Libre mill for the Steam Festival
over the weekend, said he loves the steam engines because ''on
these locomotives everything is done by people.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not the same on those modern ones, where everything is
done the modern way -- automatically,'' he added.

<HEADLINE> Barak Ready For Partial Agreement  </HEADLINE>
By JACK KATZENELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Rolling back expectations of a final deal by
next month, Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Sunday that he is
prepared for a partial agreement with the Palestinians -- a prospect
the Palestinians said is out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   Barak told the Israeli cabinet he does not rule out the
possibility that ''a comprehensive agreement will be achieved on
most of the issues, while a time limit will be set for agreement on
a very small part of them,'' his office said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian parliament speaker Ahmed Qureia, also a senior peace
negotiator, rejected the idea of another interim agreement. ''There
has to be agreement on every issue or there will be no agreement at
all,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Barak has said a full-fledged agreement would be
the preferable outcome of intensive negotiations, and has given
''50-50'' chances to achieving a deal by next month.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, his Cabinet ministers have hinted they would
accept a deal that delayed decisions on hot-button issues like
Jerusalem. Barak's statement Sunday confirmed that approach.
</P>
<P>
   The Camp David talks broke down over rival Palestinian and
Israeli claims to east Jerusalem, in particular the Al-Aqsa mosque
compound, the third holiest site in Islam and also the site of the
Jewish temple, sacked in 70 A.D. by the Romans.
</P>
<P>
   Barak told the cabinet he would never hand sovereignty over the
area to the Palestinians or any Muslim body.
</P>
<P>
   Qureia said a solution of the Jerusalem issue cannot be
postponed. ''There will be no peace and no agreement without
Jerusalem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The issues of borders and the future of the Palestinian refugees
also remain unsolved, although considerable progress has been
achieved in those areas.
</P>
<P>
   Israel media reported that Barak hopes to meet with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat soon to bridge some of the gaps. Qureia said
such a meeting would be welcome ''as long as it is not for public
relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami is to make a brief visit
to Egypt and Jordan on Monday, reportedly to enlist international
support for a compromise in which sovereignty over the Temple Mount
would be held by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council -- the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians have so far adamantly rejected that idea.
</P>
<P>
   Should the Palestinians unilaterally declare an independent
state, Israel would try to avoid an outbreak of conflict and
instead continue to cooperate with the Palestinians, Deputy Defense
Minister Ephraim Sneh said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Sneh's statement on this issue was more conciliatory than those
of Israeli leaders until now. Barak has hinted that if the
Palestinians declared a state without Israel's agreement, Israel
may annex parts of the West Bank, an act that would probably lead
to violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not seeking confrontations,'' Sneh, a close Barak
adviser, told Israel radio. ''We are seeking ways to achieve an
agreement, even in such a complex and confusing situation'' as that
which would follow a unilateral Palestinian declaration of
independence.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians said they would take such a step if the period
of the interim agreement expired without a permanent peace
agreement. However, they have already postponed the declaration
twice and Arafat has stated that even if it is made the
Palestinians will try to avoid conflict with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Sneh said Arafat's statement ''reflects a favorable wind blowing
from the Palestinian side.'' It showed that ''they are headed for
an agreement, not conflict,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's main concern would be to ensure the safety of the
Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and other security
interests, and to make sure that Israel's bargaining position would
not be harmed in future negotiations over a permanent settlement,
Sneh said.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Parliament Ousts Hardliner  </HEADLINE>
By ALI AKBAR DAREINI
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iran's reformist-dominated parliament ousted
a hard-line lawmaker Sunday, the third since the new parliament
convened in May.
</P>
<P>
   Hasan Moradi, a lawmaker from Arak, central Iran, was ousted
through a secret ballot in the 290-seat parliament, or Majlis,
lawmaker Hasan Ramezanianpour told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Moradi, a hard-liner, won his parliament seat after the Guardian
Council canceled the election of Rahman Kargosha, a pro-reform
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''The parliament dismissed Moradi to protect the votes of the
people. Contrary to the Guardian Council, the parliament could not
find plausible reasons for cancellation of the votes in Arak in
favor of Moradi,'' Ramezanianpour said.
</P>
<P>
   The Guardian Council, a hard-line body which oversees elections,
is believed to have canceled reformist seats to decrease their
influence in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Moradi was ousted after a one-hour speech broadcast live on
Tehran radio, in which he defended his right to remain in
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 230 lawmakers who attended Wednesday's session, 108 voted
in favor of his ouster, 87 against and 35 abstained. To keep his
seat, he needed a simple majority of the votes.
</P>
<P>
   All elected lawmakers must be approved by the house.
</P>
<P>
   Ramezanianpour said the vacant seat will be filled after midterm
elections. No date has yet been set for the elections, which are
expected to be held next year.
</P>
<P>
   Reformists backed by President Mohammad Khatami want increased
social and political freedoms and a loosening of the strict Islamic
rules that govern the day-to-day lives of Iranians. The hard-liners
believe any shift in the laws will dilute the ideals of the 1979
Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent backlash against their Feb. 18 election defeat,
hard-liners have shut down 25 pro-reform newspapers and jailed
dozens of reformist writers and political activists.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-liners hold less than a quarter of the seats in the
290-member house -- but they still control the judiciary, military
and the broadcast media.

<HEADLINE> Concern Surfaces Over Taco Recall  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID SCOTT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Just down the block from biotech ground zero --
the headquarters of Monsanto Co., which helps produce biotech foods
-- the Beddos shopped for groceries.
</P>
<P>
   Israel Beddo had heard about Kraft recalling taco shells because
of a particular type of bioengineered corn, but didn't think much
about it. His wife, Krista, on the other hand, was well aware of
the issue as she held their one-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they ought to leave nature alone,'' she said. ''There
is a reason food grows like it does.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft Foods recalled Taco Bell-brand shells after tests showed
they were made with a variety of genetically engineered corn that
isn't approved for human consumption because of questions about
whether it could cause allergic reactions.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after Friday's recall, people shopping for dinner in St.
Louis expressed support for biotechnology -- but growing
apprehension.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's probably (used) a lot more than we know, particularly in
the produce,'' said Diane Joiner, 41, a second-grade teacher from
St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   She was shopping with her two children at a Schnuck's
Supermarket in Richmond Heights, Mo., where the recalled shells
were still on the shelf Friday night. Joiner said the recall scared
her, not so much because of the genetically modified corn but
because it reminded her how little she knows about the food she
buys.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's never advertised blatantly,'' Joiner said. ''You might
hear a blurb on the news one day, and never hear anything else
another day. I would like to know. ... But I don't think they tell
you everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans aren't even aware of biotech foods in the
supermarket, according to a study commissioned by the International
Food Information Council, which is funded in part by biotechnology
companies. Of those surveyed in May, only 43 percent said biotech
products are in stores.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, about 50 percent of the nation's corn acreage was
planted with genetically modified seed this year, said Scarlett
Foster, a spokeswoman for St. Louis-based Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-nine percent of soybeans and 61 percent of cotton were
grown from genetically modified seed. The vast majority of those
biotech crops are grown from Monsanto seed, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The International Food Information Council found that over the
last three years support in for biotech products in the United
States has dropped. In 1997, 79 percent of those surveyed felt
biotechnology would benefit themselves or their families. That
slipped to 75 percent in February 1999, to 63 percent in October
1999, and was down to 59 percent this May.
</P>
<P>
   The corn involved in the taco shell recall is produced by
Aventis Corp. It contains a bacterium gene that makes the corn
toxic to an insect pest, and is one of the least-used varieties of
biotech corn. It's also the only genetically engineered crop of any
kind not approved for food use.
</P>
<P>
   Foster said Monsanto has a long-standing policy against
producing any biotech products that are not designed for human
consumption, as well as a policy forbidding the insertion of a
human or animal gene into a plant.
</P>
<P>
   That's not enough for Ed Fink, 35, an information services
manager at a telecommunications company who did his shopping Friday
in Ladue, Mo., at Wild Oats Market, an organic food store that
doesn't knowingly sell any genetically modified product.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping at the same store, Washington University student Nicole
Lovenduski said biotech food ''doesn't really bother me.'' She is
returning to school in St. Louis after spending a semester in
London, where public opinion is decidedly anti-biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was on the news, it was like the main event, when someone
found some crops that had been genetically engineered,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Justine McBride, also a student at Washington, believes
biotechnology can be dangerous -- but at the same time she can see
its advantages. For example, European researchers have developed
rice with extra beta carotene that's advertised as a way to save
millions of children in developing nations from blindness or
diseases like diarrhea and childhood measles.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm confused about that,'' McBride said. ''It's hard to argue
with, but in principle I'm against the bioengineering of
anything.''

<HEADLINE> Euro, Rising Oil Prices Top Agenda  </HEADLINE>
By HANS GREIMEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- Europeans tried to paint a picture
of unified, enthusiastic support for their flagging currency
Sunday, amid fears the United States was only halfheartedly behind
last week's surprise intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the other major threat to the current economic
expansion -- high oil prices -- the International Monetary Fund asked
producers and consumers to achieve stable prices at reasonable
levels.
</P>
<P>
   The sinking euro and rising oil top the agenda as the IMF and
World bank open their annual meetings here Tuesday, and all eyes
will be on financial markets Monday to see if last week's efforts
to prop up the euro and push oil lower will work.
</P>
<P>
   A synchronized move Friday by the United States, Japan, the
European Central Bank and other allies to buy the euro on foreign
exchange markets immediately boosted the currency.
</P>
<P>
   The euro surged from about 86 cents to 90 cents -- but halved
those gains by the end of Friday's trading -- after U.S. Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers said America had a vital interest in a
strong dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The statement cast doubt on U.S. commitment to the intervention
and perhaps future interventions, which essentially weaken the
dollar to give a boost to the euro. The euro, the common currency
used by 11 European Union nations, has recently plunged to record
lows.
</P>
<P>
   Before markets open Monday, European finance officials were busy
putting their own spin on Summers' comments, saying the
intervention had solid support from all members of the so-called
Group of Seven industrialized countries, including the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, President Clinton said Friday he would tap into the
U.S. emergency oil stockpile to push prices lower.
</P>
<P>
   IMF officials introduced a new plan Sunday to stabilize the
global oil market by bringing producers and consumers together,
hailing it as a major breakthrough in the current crisis, which has
seen oil prices surge to a 10-year high above $30 per barrel,
triple the price of early 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, it has been difficult to get producers and
consumers to agree on plans for the oil market, however, and the
latest effort was still short on details.
</P>
<P>
   It was contained as a major point in the final communique of the
IMF's top policy setting panel, the International Monetary and
Financial Committee, and represents a compromise with finance
ministers from big oil consuming countries and top producers,
including petroleum powerhouse Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the IMF at its best working to bring oil producers and
consumers together,'' said Gordon Brown, Britain's chancellor of
the exchequer and the chairman of the IMF policy panel. ''There is
a common understanding of the need for more stability and also a
reasonable price.''
</P>
<P>
   As top global financial figures gathered in Prague, protesters
are threatening to disrupt Tuesday's opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Many are vowing to repeat the ''Battle in Seattle,'' when mass
demonstrations outside a World Trade Organization meeting last year
deteriorated into violent clashes between demonstrators and police
and became a rallying cry for many of the enemies of economic
globalization.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no serious troubles yet in Prague, but early
Sunday, a group of 520 protesters, mostly Italian, were held up in
a train that was stopped at the border with Austria, where
officials denied entry to four of them because they had
participated in riots that marred the WTO in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   So far, demonstrators have not turned out by the tens of
thousands as some organizers had predicted, but many citizens are
frightened and numerous small businesses will stay closed this
week.
</P>
<P>
   In speeches Sunday, many of the world's finance ministers backed
a plan to double the number of poor countries getting special debt
relief by the end of this year, from 10 to 20.
</P>
<P>
   But Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin said more must be
done. He proposed that the wealthy nations declare a moratorium on
debt repayments for the world's 40 poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''At a time of unprecedented prosperity in many industrialized
countries, it is unacceptable that the promised debt relief has not
been delivered,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the activists outside agreed, with some staging a mock
funeral march and claiming that huge debt burdens are killing Third
World children because their nations cannot afford health care -- a
charge rejected by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the IMF and Pakistan struck a preliminary
agreement for a $3.5 billion bailout package to help keep the South
Asian nation from defaulting on foreign debt repayments, Pakistan
Finance Minister Shaukat Aziz said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This could be a turning point for Pakistan's economic
prospects because it is seen as validating the country's policies
and building investor confidence,'' Aziz said.

<HEADLINE> Election Supervisors' Work Stymied  </HEADLINE>
By DANICA KIRKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SILOVO, Yugoslavia (AP) -- U.S. soldiers prepared for weeks ahead
of Sunday's elections in Kosovo, ready to take on whatever might
come their way.
</P>
<P>
   Not that U.S. Sgt. Sean Egan of Fort Knox, Ky., ended up being
too occupied: The polling station he was supposed to keep an eye
out on simply didn't open -- another casualty in an election marked
by fraud and irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tried to teach them baseball, but they kept trying to kick
the ball,'' the 23-year-old said. ''We tried to teach them football
too, but that didn't work either.''
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeepers throughout Kosovo stood at a distance from schools,
houses and other polling stations throughout this southern province
of Yugoslavia, looking out for trouble and counting heads as Kosovo
Serbs took part in elections for president of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The mission was more delicate than it might seem.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials had been adamant that they would not take part
in elections in which Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic faced
his most potent challenger in his 13 years in power.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time though, observers had to be close enough to
polling places to see how many people actually trickled past in an
effort to provide independent analysis for charges of a fraud long
predicted to occur.
</P>
<P>
   NATO-led peacekeepers had to be close enough to counter any
violence, but far enough away not to appear to be supporting the
polls. How would it look, after all, if NATO-led peacekeepers were
photographed near polling stations during a vote than many believed
in advance would run completely counter to democratic principles?
</P>
<P>
   Enter the middle ground, where peacekeepers appeared in force on
streets of Serb enclaves like Silovo, 40 miles southeast of the
capital, Pristina, making a strong stand while avoiding even the
semblance of support.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today,'' said Lt. Col. Bryan Foy of New Braunfels, Texas, ''we
choose to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end though, voting proved to be much less of a
distraction than a wedding parade being held through the village's
main street. U.S. soldiers couldn't help but wandering into the
center of the tumult and were forced to vehemently, albeit
politely, refuse to drink shots of strong wine brandy offered by
wandering merrymakers.
</P>
<P>
   Others watched that event from afar, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''We figured a lot of people would come up to vote,'' said Spec.
Douglas Parker, 22, of Lake City, Fla., from his perch on a hill
above the wedding part. ''Nobody showed up.''

<HEADLINE> Basque Blame Government for Attacks  </HEADLINE>
By CIARAN GILES
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Following a massive protest march against
violence by Basque separatists, influential politicians in Spain's
Basque region blamed the government for the resurgence of attacks
by the gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   Xabier Arzalluz, head of the region's governing Basque
Nationalist Party, said Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar had
''done nothing'' to encourage ETA to uphold last year's cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Aznar's government had ''placed sticks in the spokes of
the peace process,'' Arzalluz said in a speech before thousands of
followers in the Basque capital of Vitoria on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ETA, whose name is a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland
and Freedom, is fighting for an independent state that would
straddle the western Spanish-French border.
</P>
<P>
   It ended a 14-month unilateral cease-fire in December, saying
the peace process was going nowhere. Since then it has claimed
responsibility for 12 killings.
</P>
<P>
   It was blamed for one more after Jose Luis Ruiz Casado, a
councilor of Aznar's ruling Popular Party, was shot dead Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Only one round of talks was held during the 14-month truce, but
it proved fruitless. Arzalluz accused the Aznar government of
wrecking the process by making no concessions on the issue of ETA
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   ''Aznar says he will finish with ETA soon. If only he could!''
shouted Arzalluz.
</P>
<P>
   ''But most likely he will leave us with the same legacy as
Franco: more hate, more anger and more ETA,'' he said, referring to
late Spanish dictator Gen. Francisco Franco, whose 1939-78 regime
suppressed Basque nationalism and culture.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of people attended a march Saturday in the
city of San Sebastian to protest against the ETA and its wave of
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Arzalluz and Basque regional president Juan Jose Ibarretxe, a
fellow party member who also criticized Aznar, boycotted the march,
saying it was orchestrated by the Aznar government as an attack on
Basque nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   Aznar's Popular Party and the leading opposition Socialist party
are seeking votes of no confidence against Ibarretxe's Basque
government in the coming weeks. They hope to force new elections in
the region to erode the support of Basque nationalist parties.
</P>
<P>
   Aznar has accused Arzalluz's party of encouraging separatist
violence by demanding ETA's political allies be allowed into talks
on solving the Basque conflict.

<HEADLINE> Low crime rates send police on search for fugitives  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - With New Jersey's crime rate at its lowest
in nearly three decades, the state's law enforcement officers are
turning their attention to more than 26,000 fugitives who so far
have escaped justice.
</P>
<P>
   Violent crime has fallen for the sixth straight year in New
Jersey, according to the 1999 Uniform Crime Report, and the state's
crime rate is now the lowest it's been since 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials say they could drive that number still
lower by concentrating their efforts on wanted criminals who are
likely to be repeat offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not only clearing up the warrants,'' Capt. Stephen
Kaminsky of the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office told The
Star-Ledger of Newark for Sunday's editions, ''we are clearing up
the crime rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Many municipal and county agencies are adding people to their
fugitive squads, and a statewide network of fugitive investigators
to share information and tactics is under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   State Police Lt. Jim Blong, who heads the eight-person fugitive
squad for the agency, also is in charge of the effort to create a
New Jersey Fugitive Investigators Association.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose, he said, ''is to keep each other in touch with who
is wanted and try to focus on the most violent and repeat
offenders.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1997 to 1998, the number of arrests made by his squad rose
from 261 to 529, and last year the squad upped the number to 665.
</P>
<P>
   When Somerset County Prosecutor Wayne Forrest took the job three
years ago, he made his department one of the first in the state to
reconfigure the fugitive squad into an organized unit of his
office.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is important stuff. If people think they can take off and
they are home free,'' said Forrest, then officers ''are going to be
there standing at their door when they get home.''
</P>
<P>
   Middlesex, Union and Essex county authorities also are
reevaluating the role of their fugitive squads and considering
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ''As crime does decrease, it frees up people from certain units
that may not need as many people,'' Kaminsky said.
</P>
<P>
   The Middlesex prosecutor's office also has begun working with
local police to conduct organized sweeps for wanted criminals,
including one earlier this month in Perth Amboy that netted nine
fugitives in one night.
</P>
<P>
   ''In most jurisdictions, serious crime is down and attention can
and should be paid to clearing up old matters,'' said Robert
Louden, director of the Criminal Justice Center at John Jay College
in New York. ''We have time to look now.''

<HEADLINE> Congressional 'physics caucus' is tiny but bipartisan  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - On his hectic first day on Capitol Hill as
congressman-elect, Democrat Rush Holt of New Jersey made time to
visit a Republican - Rep. Vernon Ehlers of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Ehlers at the time was the first and only research physicist
ever to serve in Congress. Holt was about to become the second.
</P>
<P>
   ''We joked (that) if we can find a room with a chalkboard, we'll
set up a bipartisan physics caucus,'' Holt said after the 1998
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out, they weren't joking. Holt and Ehlers have become the
Science Guys of Congress, joining forces across party lines to
support research and science education.
</P>
<P>
   Working together, they added language to an education funding
flexibility act to prevent schools from spending less on math and
science.
</P>
<P>
   They opposed legislation jeered by many scientists that would
require most taxpayer-funded research to be made public upon
request.
</P>
<P>
   They fought for an amendment giving science equal billing with
reading and math in federal Title I programs for disadvantaged
students.
</P>
<P>
   They co-hosted a breakfast honoring the U.S. team competing in
the International Physics Olympiad and a discussion with the
American Society of Mechanical Engineers on how to improve science,
math, engineering and technology teaching in high schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''We work well together,'' Ehlers said. ''It's unfortunate we're
not in the same party. That would help even more.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Holt, ''A lot of people recognize that we've spent years
thinking about science education and the role of research in
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Ehlers, in his fourth term, is comfortably ensconced in the
House. But Holt, a freshman, is one of the Republican Party's top
targets this fall. His opponent is former Rep. Dick Zimmer, who
represented the district until 1997 and says Holt has proven to be
too big a fan of federal spending.
</P>
<P>
   Ehlers said he has received no pressure from his party to stop
cooperating with his Democratic colleague.
</P>
<P>
   Other members of Congress have backgrounds in science. Rep.
Roscoe Bartlett, R-Md., holds a Ph.D. in physiology and worked as a
professor and researcher before joining Congress. Rep. John Olver,
D-Mass., has a Ph.D. in chemistry and also was a professor.
</P>
<P>
   But Ehlers says he and Holt are the first research physicists -
trained in the study of matter, energy and motion - to serve in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   One person who has not yet mastered the formula is President
Clinton, who last year praised Holt as ''our only bona fide
scientist'' in Congress and this year called him ''the only
physicist in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Ehlers, 66, received a doctorate in nuclear physics from the
University of California at Berkeley. Before being elected to
Congress in a special election in 1993, he was a state lawmaker
and, earlier, chairman of the physics department at Calvin College.
</P>
<P>
   Holt, 51, received a doctorate in physics from New York
University. Prior to his election in 1998, he was assistant
director of the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Woytowicz, a science policy fellow at the American
Chemical Society, said Ehlers and Holt became particularly valuable
allies to the science community when Rep. George Brown, D-Calif,
died last year. Brown championed science and technology issues
during 17 terms in the House.
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, colleagues seek out Ehlers and Holt on science
matters. At the request of then-Speaker Newt Gingrich, Ehlers
directed a 1998 study - ''Unlocking Our Future: Toward a New
National Science Policy'' - that laid out the case for more funding
of scientific research.
</P>
<P>
   Holt says colleagues have approached him with questions like
''How does a fuel cell work?''
</P>
<P>
   The two lawmakers don't always agree on science issues. Holt
supported two attempts to reduce NASA's contribution to the
international space station. Ehlers voted no. Both measures failed.
</P>
<P>
   What has united them most is their work on the House Education
and Workforce Committee, where they have argued that science
education is important even for those who do not become scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ability to look for patterns is a critical skill, whether
you're going to be a lawyer, a doctor, a legislator,'' Holt said.
</P>
<P>
   Agreed Ehlers, ''We're not trying to produce nerds - even though
I still wear my plastic pocket protector.''

<HEADLINE> Eddie Vedder Opens for Nader  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Eddie Vedder was a hit at his first appearance at
a political rally.
</P>
<P>
   The frontman for the grunge rock band Pearl Jam opened for Green
Party presidential nominee Ralph Nader on Saturday night. Thousands
of people turned out for the event.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Vedder's band mates showed up too, but perhaps just to
see where their money went. A few months ago, Vedder gave the Nader
campaign a few thousand dollars of the band's money -- without the
band's permission.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically, I told them the next day, 'Hey, we donated a few
grand to Nader.' I just assumed they'd agree with me,'' Vedder told
The Associated Press. ''They said, 'OK. But we have a few
questions.' I think those questions are getting answered.''

<HEADLINE> Swiss Reject Limits on Immigration  </HEADLINE>
By GEIR MOULSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- Swiss voters on Sunday rejected a plan to cut the
proportion of foreigners in the country to 18 percent of the
population and fix it there by law.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fifth anti-immigration plan to fail since 1970, but
the result showed that concerns persist among a significant
minority over what the plan's backers called ''mass immigration.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm extremely happy with the clear result,'' said Justice
Minister Ruth Metzler, adding that the limit on foreigners ''would
not have been a good thing for our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Final results showed 63.7 percent of voters -- 1.33 million
people -- voted against the ''initiative for the regulation of
immigration.''
</P>
<P>
   It was supported by 756,000 votes, or 36.3 percent. None of the
26 cantons, or states, voted in favor of the measure. National
turnout was 43.4 percent, about average for Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers who launched the initiative five years ago, in
mid-recession, said the country suffered from cheap imported labor
and a steady increase in foreign residents. Unemployment is now 1.8
percent -- its lowest in more than eight years.
</P>
<P>
   The government, industry figures and bankers said the cap on
foreigners would lock out experts in areas such as health and
information technology, damage tourism, undermine Switzerland's
humanitarian tradition and tarnish its international image.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, foreigners accounted for 19.3 percent of the 7.2
million population. It was unclear how the proportion would be cut
to 18 percent, where it stood when the initiative was launched.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a capacity to welcome people in our country which is
much bigger than that,'' lawmaker Christiane Brunner, a Social
Democrat who opposed the cap, told Swiss television. But ''it's not
unlimited.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see myself as a loser,'' said Philipp Mueller, a local
lawmaker from northern Aargau canton who led the effort to limit
foreigners. ''This isn't a collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   The right-wing Swiss People's Party, one of four members of the
coalition government, said in a statement that ''the high number of
'yes' votes is a clear sign of displeasure with the government's
failed (immigration) policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The other three government parties all opposed the move, which
was expected to fail.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss vote came as countries across Europe grapple with an
aging population and increasing anti-foreigner sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss People's Party made large election gains last year
after campaigning with the slogan ''Stop Asylum Abuse'' --
reflecting the success of the anti-immigrant Freedom Party in
neighboring Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns are frequently raised about high numbers of foreigners
in Swiss schools. Some right-wing politicians openly suggest Balkan
immigrants have violent tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss Democrats, a right-wing nationalist party that backed
the cap, expressed ''great disappointment and concern'' at Sunday's
result.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a few years the proportion of foreigners ... will be 25
percent or more,'' it said in a statement. ''It is probably the
fate of our country that it will be fully internationalized and its
Swiss character will be lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The closest result came in Schwyz, in the conservative
German-speaking center of the country, where 51.6 percent voted
against. At the other end was Geneva, where 76 percent voted no.
</P>
<P>
   The government has drawn up its own new law which would restrict
immigration of unqualified workers from outside the European Union
and aims to better integrate the existing foreign population.

<HEADLINE> RETRANSMITTING to CORRECT category code  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in
New York faced charges of being a carpetbagger, getting the party's
nomination only because of the famous last name and wanting the job
as a stepping stone back to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2000? No, Robert F. Kennedy in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   The same sort of criticism the first lady has encountered across
New York dogged Kennedy 36 years ago when he sought the very same
Senate seat she is now running for.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was 10 years old and I knew what a carpetbagger was,''
recalls the slain senator's son, environmentalist Robert F. Kennedy
Jr. ''Everywhere we went, the carpetbagger issue was a part of the
conversation ... It was a huge issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There were really Bobby Kennedy haters out there and they were
at every stop,'' the younger Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   While the elder Kennedy spent much of his youth in New York, he
was forever identified with Massachusetts, his family's home turf.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy held the Senate seat until 1968, when he was
assassinated in Los Angeles in the midst of his run for the
Democratic presidential nomination. His death came five years after
the assassination of his brother, President John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ''(Robert) Kennedy listened to a lot of the same (criticism)''
said pollster Maurice Carroll, who was a newspaper reporter in New
York City during the 1964 Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a Democrat, faces Republican Rep. Rick Lazio in
November's election. According to the Clinton camp, the first lady
and some of her top aides have poured over news reports from the
time, looking for hints on how to handle similar criticism.
</P>
<P>
   When they asked Kennedy's son to stand by her side at an
endorsement event in early September, he spoke publicly about the
parallels.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was here in 1964, campaigning across the state with my
father, and I heard the same thing all across the state then - that
he's a carpetbagger and how could he be a good senator for New York
State,'' Kennedy told Clinton supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is somebody who was not born in this state capable of coming
in and offering leadership? My answer to that is resoundingly,
yes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the issue of state residency and the connection to the
White House, there are other similarities between the 1964 race and
this year's version.
</P>
<P>
   Both Kennedy and Clinton pushed a popular New York member of
Congress who had been considering a run for Senate to the sidelines
when they became the party's nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were Sam Stratton and Nita Lowey.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, Stratton's career hopes were dashed by Kennedy's
appearance on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sam's favorite quote from that time was, 'I think I was
running a real good race and had a shot at this until Bobby Kennedy
decided he was a New Yorker,''' said Roger Mott, Stratton's
son-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six years later, Clinton has cast a similar shadow over
Rep. Nita Lowey.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran New York Democratic consultant Hank Sheinkopf cautioned
against reading too much into the similarities between 1964 and
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ''The dynamics are entirely different,'' Sheinkopf said. ''There
was an incumbent president, Kennedy was the brother of a martyred
president ...''
</P>
<P>
   But for the former senator's son, the echoes of the long-ago
campaign linger. There are fond memories.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got to go all over the state and see the huge crowds,'' he
remembered. ''While there was viciousness in the campaign, my
father always treated it with humor and I think that defused it for
his children.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of politics is a game and it should be fun,'' he added.
''It's a big mistake to take it too seriously and I think he
understood that.''

<HEADLINE> Law Shielded Against Y2K Lawsuits  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Worried that a flood of Y2K cases could
cripple the economy, Congress last year passed legislation to limit
lawsuits related to the computer problem and save American
businesses billions of dollars in legal costs.
</P>
<P>
   Government investigators now report that companies invoked it in
court just 18 times, which a congressional critic saw as a
''fitting postscript'' to Y2K alarms that never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who voted against the legislation
last year and commissioned the General Accounting Office report,
said the study ''confirms that in the courts, the Y2K bill was
mostly used by big companies to delay or sidetrack relief to
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ''This is a lesson for the next time special interests
ask Congress for special legal protections.''
</P>
<P>
   A colleague who worked to pass the measure countered that it
helped businesses concentrate on solving the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Y2K Act encouraged businesses to be proactive in
addressing and remedying their Y2K challenges, rather than
defensive and fearful of a predicted flood of lawsuits,'' said Sen.
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ''The success with which our nation's businesses met the Y2K
issue was in significant part facilitated by this legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   The report by the investigative arm of Congress showed that
defendants used the Y2K Act 12 times in federal court and 6 times
in state court. The suits involved class actions by customers,
disputes between businesses and disputes against insurers.
Compilers said they had no way to tell how many times the law was
invoked to keep cases out of court.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, defendants invoking the Y2K Act eventually
settled the cases or had them dismissed. Ten cases were pending
when the report was finished last month.
</P>
<P>
   The law allowed defendants to move some state cases to federal
court, challenge class action lawsuits and force plaintiffs to use
mediation.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K problem occurred because of the fear that some computer
programs, especially older ones, might fail when the date changed
to 2000. Because the programs were written to recognize only the
last two digits of a year to save space, such programs could have
read the digits ''00'' as 1900 instead of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The United States spent about $100 billion to fix the problem.
The problems after the rollover were sporadic and very few, but
some computers left unrepaired did fail.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed overwhelmingly in both the House and Senate.
President Clinton repeatedly threatened to veto early versions,
which he said went too far in restricting Americans' rights to sue
for full compensation for wrongs.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats negotiated with the White House to give the
bill added protections for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that we find that the Y2K Act succeeds in helping to
screen out frivolous claims without blocking or unduly burdening
legitimate suits,'' Clinton said in a statement when he signed the
bill in July 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will be watching to see whether the bill's provisions are
misused by parties who did little or nothing to remediate in order
to defeat claims brought by those harmed by irresponsible
conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chief Senate sponsor, argued during
negotiations with the White House that an avalanche of lawsuits
could have a ''crippling effect on our economy.'' Some experts
estimated $1 trillion in civil actions.
</P>
<P>
   Among examples cited in the as-yet-unreleased GAO report, which
was obtained by The Associated Press:
</P>
<P>
   --A suit against electronics retailers such as Circuit City and
CompUSA accused the companies of selling computer hardware and
software that they knew were not Y2K-compliant. The defendants used
the Y2K law's higher standards for notice and jurisdiction to have
the case dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   --A plaintiff alleged that a manufacturer called its Y2K overhaul
an ''upgrade,'' refused to honor standard maintenance agreements
and charged at least 400 clients $6,000 each. The defendants
invoked the Y2K law's forced mediation clause, but the parties had
not settled as of March.
</P>
<P>
   --A California plaintiff sued computer maker Packard Bell NEC for
selling personal computers susceptible to the Year 2000 bug. The
suit said the company refused to repair the malfunctioning date,
which required a user to enter the correct date when the computer
was turned on. A judge dismissed the case under the Y2K law and the
plaintiff appealed, but the case was settled out of court.

<HEADLINE> Carreras Dedicates Concert to Kursk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Tenor Jose Carreras dedicated his concert to the
118 Russian sailors killed when the Kursk nuclear submarine sank
last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know what pain and suffering is,'' the 53-year-old Spanish
singer said during a concert Saturday. ''Music always gives
strength and allows a person to fight on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk suffered two explosions Aug. 12. and sank to the
Barents Sea floor. Officials have not determined what caused the
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Carreras, who performed in the grandiose Kremlin Palace of
Congresses, said the music of Russian composer Sergei Rachmaninoff
had helped him overcome a battle with leukemia.

<HEADLINE> Deaths of cross-country teammates test a community's faith  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CROGHAN, N.Y. (AP) - They clustered in front of St. Stephen's
Church 45 minutes before the Roman Catholic Mass began, to bid
farewell to another Beaver River classmate.
</P>
<P>
   The girls clutched tufts of tissues, later reduced to soggy,
tattered shreds. The boys jammed their hands into their pockets and
shifted their weight from leg to leg.
</P>
<P>
   Then they filed inside on this bright, balmy September
afternoon, filling the pews and balcony, and clogging the back of
the church for the nearly two-hour service.
</P>
<P>
   After a band teacher and a baseball coach eulogized Dereck
Farney, after they finished talking about his energy, his smile,
his wit, his faith and his athletic gifts, the congregation
shuffled outside.
</P>
<P>
   They hugged and cried and stared as the hearse drove away. Most
of the teen-agers, if they had attended a wake or funeral at all,
had grieved for elderly grandparents, aunts or uncles in this rural
village of 3,000 in north-central New York.
</P>
<P>
   But now, fewer than 40 days apart, accidents had claimed the
lives of two classmates. Both boys, Dereck Farney and Michael
Ardison, were members of the Beaver River cross country team, a
perennial state championship contender.
</P>
<P>
   Farney, 14, was hit by a car Sept. 13 as he jogged with
teammates on a country highway. He died two days later in a
Syracuse hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Ardison, 15, was riding his bicycle to his girlfriend's house on
Aug. 7 when he slammed into a truck. He died hours later in a
Lowville hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Both accidents occurred at T intersections on main country
roads. Both boys' mothers work at Beaver River Central School, the
building that houses grades K through 12. Kristi Ardison is a
secretary in the middle school. Barbara Farney is a second-grade
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just so unbelievable, especially for the kids,'' cross
country coach Travis Kuhl said.
</P>
<P>
   Unbelievable because this is a place where silos stud the
rolling landscape, where cows graze and motorists steer to the side
of the road to allow large tractors hauling hay to pass.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's one of those things,'' said 16-year-old Zane Buckingham,
a junior on the Beaver River cross country team. ''Why does it keep
happening to us?''
</P>
<P>
   Kristi Ardison can't explain it. She felt a strange weight,
something she can't fully describe, the day before her son was
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Mike had been asking if he could visit his girlfriend in Beaver
Falls, about eight miles from his home in Indian River. It was a
trip he'd made countless times, but his mom was reluctant to grant
permission this time. Mike had to finish his chores. She wanted him
to go grocery shopping with her, but he declined.
</P>
<P>
   The more Kristi thought about him sitting at home and stewing,
the more she realized she'd have to relent. And so she did.
</P>
<P>
   When she returned from the supermarket, Kristi's mother-in-law
was walking toward the house supported by two female relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''She said, 'It's bad. It's really bad,' '' Kristi said. ''She
couldn't say it.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ardison had been coasting down a hill on the road where
the family lives. But the brakes on his bike failed and he crashed
into a truck driven by 33-year-old Timothy Tabolt, fracturing his
skull.
</P>
<P>
   ''When they told me, I just thought 'No, he's at a friend's
house,' '' Kristi Ardison said. ''And then the whole world turned
to glass and I just couldn't feel anything. I was numb.''
</P>
<P>
   No tickets were issued to Tabolt, who was a high school
classmate of Kristi Ardison's.
</P>
<P>
   At school these days, Kristi Ardison collects letters addressed
to Michael from interested college coaches. She wraps them up and
takes them home, where she keeps them in a special place.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mike loved to run. He was always checking the bottom of his
shoes to see if his form was OK,'' Kristi said. ''I think he felt
free when he ran.''
</P>
<P>
   Dereck Farney loved the Yankees and idolized shortstop Derek
Jeter. He was a multi-sport athlete who ran cross country in the
fall, played basketball in the winter and lived for baseball in the
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Farney was a freshman on the cross country team this year. His
teammates say he cracked them up with his biting barbs.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'd just always find something to pick on,'' teammate Tim
Scarpinato said. ''He wasn't mean, he was just really funny.''
</P>
<P>
   The team set out to run the roads near school on Sept. 13, like
they did almost every day. Farney jogged with five other boys.
</P>
<P>
   The road where the accident occurred is straight with generous
shoulders. A teammate, 14-year-old Caleb Rose, ran just ahead of
Farney and heard the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ''He went to cross the road and I don't think he looked,'' Rose
said. ''I turned around and saw it. I knew it was bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Farney was struck by a car driven by Anne Bloss, 47, of Croghan,
as his teammates yelled for him to watch out. Bloss was not charged
in the accident.
</P>
<P>
   The team runs in pairs or single file, cross country senior
Danielle Buzzell said. Runners in the back of the pack shout up to
runners in the front when cars are approaching. Buzzell said the
system works, but that runners occasionally encounter back country
road speeders who refuse to slow down for the athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of the kids wondered if they could have done anything
differently to help Dereck. I myself felt pretty guilty because I
had given them the run to do,'' Kuhl said. ''But it wasn't any of
their faults. It was just one of those crazy accidents.''
</P>
<P>
   School was closed last Wednesday in honor of Ardison, Farney and
10-year-old Harley Davis of Beaver Falls, who was killed Aug. 21 in
a sand bank collapse. The day off allowed students to attend
Farney's funeral, their second service in 35 days.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't understand it,'' Kuhl said. ''We don't know why it
happened. We just keep encouraging each other. There must be some
reason for it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think, really, it was God's plan,'' Kristi Ardison said.
''For some reason, He just wanted them back.''

<HEADLINE> Ray Says Clinton Probe Near End  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Robert Ray, acknowledging
the public's wish that he finish work, said Sunday a decision on
prosecuting President Clinton for his conduct in the Monica
Lewinsky scandal will come ''very shortly'' after Clinton leaves
the White House in January.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the public would like me to wrap up this
investigation, but that doesn't mean walk away from the
responsibilities I have,'' Ray said on CNN's ''Late Edition.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That decision will be rendered shortly, very shortly after the
president leaves office in the best interest of the country, and
also not to unfairly tread on the new president's administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing those who say it is time to put an end to the Clinton
investigations, Ray said, ''Closure comes not at the price of
waiving away one's responsibilities''
</P>
<P>
   The question involving Clinton is the last major piece of
unfinished business in the $52 million independent counsel
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Ray announced last week that he was ending the six-year
Whitewater investigation after finding insufficient evidence that
Clinton or Hillary Rodham Clinton had committed a crime.
</P>
<P>
   A grand jury was impaneled in July to help decide whether
Clinton should be indicted on charges he committed perjury or
obstructed justice when he denied his affair with Lewinsky in sworn
testimony in the Paula Jones case. The scandal led to Clinton's
impeachment and a Senate trial, in which he was acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Ray said the decision whether to prosecute will not be affected
by who wins the presidential election. Other factors could
influence the decision, such as ''whether there's a substantial
federal interest in bringing a case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ray also said Clinton's disbarment case in Arkansas could be a
factor. He did not say how that might affect the decision.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Whitewater investigation, Ray said his work
was completed when he determined there was insufficient evidence
that the Clintons committed a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he had enough evidence to obtain grand jury indictments,
he would not have filed charges unless he believed he had enough
evidence to convict.
</P>
<P>
   ''No responsible prosecutor would bring a case simply based on a
judgment that a grand jury would return a charge by a probable
cause determination,'' he said. ''Much more is expected of a
prosecutor.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was important to announce that the investigation had
ended.
</P>
<P>
   ''The country is entitled to closure as a matter of fairness,''
he said. Referring to Hillary Clinton's Senate candidacy in New
York, he said ''A candidate for the United States Senate is
entitled to finality and a rendering of a judgment if one could
appropriately be made before the election.''

<HEADLINE> Fear Reigns on Yugoslav Voting Day  </HEADLINE>
By KATARINA KRATOVAC
<TEXT>
<P>
   POZAREVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Warming his bones in the afternoon
sun, Rodoljub Veljkovic whispered: ''I hate him.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Slobodan Milosevic's hometown -- dubbed by locals as ''the
forbidden city'' -- almost no one dares to turn against the
hard-line Yugoslav president. Not even in a ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Not in this sensitive city where the Milosevic family has a
heavy imprint, and where residents fear police surveillance and
crackdowns by authorities for voicing any objection to the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Police cars circled main streets on election day and Milosevic
looked down from Socialist campaign posters plastered across town.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday's Yugoslav elections, a local official at the
communists' election headquarters beamed with confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expect to win 62 seats out of 68 in the Pozarevac
district,'' Dragan Jovanovic, said, surrounded by pictures of
Milosevic's influential wife, Mirjana Markovic, whose neo-communist
Yugoslav Left is allied with the Socialists.
</P>
<P>
   The Milosevic family's imprint on this town of 90,000 people,
some 60 miles east of the capital Belgrade, is visible everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling couple grew up here and attended the local high
school.
</P>
<P>
   Veljkovic pointed his cane to a nearby meadow. ''I remember when
Milosevic was a boy, he used to play over there,'' the 81-year-old
milkman said. ''Everyone liked him. Now he has destroyed us all.''
</P>
<P>
   But Veljkovic's two daughters work in state-owned companies, and
he is terrified of hurting them by speaking his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's son, Marko, 26, monopolizes several local businesses
-- a bakery, a disco club and a ''cyber'' cafe.
</P>
<P>
   However, the classy discotheque ''Madonna,'' the largest in the
country, shut down because of a lack of visitors this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The young Milosevic's latest venture -- a 150-acre amusement park
called ''Bambiland'' -- estimated to be worth $325,000 and built
just a mile out of town during last year's clash with NATO also
seems doomed to fail.
</P>
<P>
   Envisaged as a Serbian-styled Disneyland, the park apparently
proved too much for citizens with an average monthly wage of $25.
It was unclear if it would be reopened after being closed in
summer.
</P>
<P>
   In Pozarevac, anyone who publicly goes against the mainstream
can be threatened with layoffs or sudden inspections of financial
books by law enforcement, opposition people say.
</P>
<P>
   ''For someone to come and even show his face here, it takes a
lot of courage,'' said Slavoljub Matic at the opposition's
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Matic, a local official of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia,
said not a single opposition campaign poster survived more than two
hours on Pozarevac streets.
</P>
<P>
   ''In their minds we don't exist,'' Matic said.

<HEADLINE> French Want Shorter President Term  </HEADLINE>
By DEBORAH SEWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- French voters easily approved a referendum Sunday
on shortening the presidential term to five years, according to
early projections, but dismal turnout was likely to deprive the
country's leaders of any major political gain from the change aimed
at modernizing French politics.
</P>
<P>
   With 80 percent of the vote counted late Sunday, the Interior
Ministry said the measure was approved by 73.2 percent of voters,
with 26.8 percent voting against. Voter abstention was nearly 70
percent, a record.
</P>
<P>
   The referendum failed to interest voters, and the abysmal
turnout indicated that many French voters were more concerned about
social, wage and educational issues than political reform.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after the polls closed, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
said he regretted the low turnout, adding that ''I am happy for
this reform that I called for'' and saying he hoped for even more
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac, who had opposed the constitutional
change until recently, told his countrymen in an address on
nationwide television after the polls closed that ''Your democratic
power is going to be reinforced.''
</P>
<P>
   However, many politicians, ranging from far right leader
Jean-Marie Le Pen to the Communists to the Greens on the left,
disparaged the referendum, while veteran conservative Charles
Pasqua of the Rally for France party expressed concern.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am sad for democracy when you see such a lack of interest.
It's worrying,'' said Pasqua, a Chirac rival who may run for
president in the next elections in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The reform's proponents believe cutting the term from seven to
five years will give French voters a chance to elect their head of
state more often and lower the risk of ''cohabitation,'' an often
unwieldy situation that arises when the president and the prime
minister come from opposing parties.
</P>
<P>
   Polls leading up to Sunday's vote showed widespread apathy for
the constitutional change, which easily could have been made by a
vote of a joint session of both houses of parliament rather than a
referendum.
</P>
<P>
   The French president's term is the longest -- along with Ireland
-- in Europe, and the reform was supposed to bring the term of
France's most powerful office more in line with other major
democracies.
</P>
<P>
   The French president is commander in chief of the armed forces,
appoints the prime minister, has the power to dissolve the National
Assembly, France's parliament and is traditionally France's top
voice in foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Previous French presidents have tried -- and failed -- to change
the seven-year term, which has been in place since 1873.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reduce the term received an impetus after former
President Francois Mitterrand's 14-year stint in office. Critics of
the presidential term said power had stagnated toward the end of
Mitterrand's term and that nearly a decade and a half in office was
too long in the fast-changing, modern world.
</P>
<P>
   Both Chirac and Jospin, who are expected to face off in
presidential elections in two years, favored the change and were
likely to suffer little more than embarrassment over the abysmal
turnout.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of interest among the French in Sunday's vote beat the
record set in a 1988 referendum on the French territory of New
Caledonia, when 63 percent of voters abstained. Including Sunday's
vote, there have been nine referendums since the birth of the Fifth
Republic in 1958. In his TV speech, Chirac promised to make greater
use of the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the seriousness of the proposed change, the public was
uninterested.
</P>
<P>
   Pocketbook issues, including high gas taxes that sparked a
weeklong trucker's protest this month, wages, education and health
care reform seemed far more important.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the long term say it contributes to political
stability. Its opponents claim the mandate is too long and reform
is needed so voters can be consulted more often in today's rapidly
changing world.
</P>
<P>
   Voters on Sunday were asked one question: ''Do you approve the
proposed constitutional law fixing the term of the presidential
mandate to five years?''
</P>
<P>
   If the change is approved, the president elected in 2002
elections would be the first to have the five-year term.

<HEADLINE> New York wing of Reform Party backs Hagelin  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The New York wing of the national Reform
Party on Sunday turned its back on Pat Buchanan, giving its
presidential ballot line to his rival for the party's hearts and
minds, John Hagelin.
</P>
<P>
   One leader of New York's Independence Party said the refusal to
line up behind Buchanan amounted to a ''de facto'' disaffiliation
with the national Reform Party. However, no formal vote was taken
at the state convention on such a move.
</P>
<P>
   In backing Hagelin, the Independence Party leaders also rejected
an effort by Ralph Nader to secure the ballot line. Nader is
already on the state's November ballot as the candidate of the
Green Party.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan is also already on the New York ballot, having
circulated petitions to qualify an independent ''Buchanan-Reform''
line.
</P>
<P>
   Nader's effort to win the Independence Party line in New York,
to go with his Green Party line, came apart after his camp refused
to back the U.S. Senate candidate of the Independence Party, Jeff
Graham, a former mayor of Watertown. Graham is facing Democrat
Hillary Rodham Clinton and Republican Rep. Rick Lazio, among
others, in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   It was Graham who said the decision not to back Buchanan's
candidacy amounted to a ''de facto'' disaffiliation from the
national party.
</P>
<P>
   While Hagelin has managed to get on the ballot in a dozen states
as the Reform Party candidate, Buchanan has locked up the majority
of such state lines and has been awarded more than $12 million in
federal funds for his campaign by the Federal Election Commission.
The FEC rejected a plea by Hagelin to obtain those funds.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin scored points with leaders of the Independence Party,
meeting this weekend in Albany, simply by showing up at the state
convention. Nader and Buchanan had sent representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''Woody Allen once said, 'The world is run by those who show
up,''' Graham told his fellow Independence Party members at the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Nader had his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has not only talked the talk, he has walked the walk,''
said Philip Goldstein, who told the convention Hagelin was ''a
little too much of a snake oil salesman.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, only the names of Nader and Hagelin were put into
nomination at the state party's convention. Hagelin topped Nader by
a better than 10-1 margin in the weighted voting.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot wait to begin campaigning on behalf of the
Independence Party,'' Hagelin told the convention after his
victory. ''We will make you proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Buchanan was the darling of many in New
York's Independence Party, gaining the support of one of its most
prominent leaders, Lenora Fulani, a perennial candidate of the
left-leaning New Alliance Party for everything from governor to
president.
</P>
<P>
   But Fulani broke with the conservative Buchanan before the
Reform Party's national convention over his social views and his
refusal to back her in a move to become state chairwoman of the New
York Independence Party.
</P>
<P>
   As with past Independence Party gatherings, Sunday's turned
contentious at times.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm getting sick and tired of people telling us to shut up,''
said Pauline Finch, a delegate from Syracuse who complained when a
party member who was not a delegate wasn't allowed to speak.
''We're pulling ourselves apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader's flirtation with the Independence Party had angered many
of the leaders of the state's Green Party who said if he appeared
on the rival third-party's ballot line, it could cost other Green
Party candidates votes.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York ballot, the Independence Party appears third,
behind the Republican and Democratic parties, while the Green Party
shows up in the seventh spot. Green Party leaders feared New
Yorkers might vote for Nader on the Independence line and never
make it down to the Green Party line.
</P>
<P>
   Recent independent polls have shown Nader collecting from 3
percent to 6 percent of the New York vote with Buchanan at 1
percent or 2 percent. Hagelin has been only a blip in such polls.
Nationally, Hagelin, a physicist, is also the candidate of the
Natural Law Party.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, polls show Democrat Al Gore well ahead of
Republican George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most other states, New York allows candidates to combine
the votes obtained on multiple ballot lines. For instance, Gore's
name will also appear on the ballot lines of the Liberal and
Working Families parties while Bush's name is also on the
Conservative Party line.

<HEADLINE> Groups say proposed auto accident claim rules too strict  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - When the state narrowed the time frame for
filing no-fault automobile accident claims in February, VIP Billing
felt the crunch.
</P>
<P>
   ''We barely survived that time,'' said Leila Wilson, a manager
at the private billing firm in Brooklyn. ''All our expenses doubled
or tripled.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the regulation changes, car accident victims had to alert
insurance carriers about doctor's visits within 30 days, down from
the three-month period allowed in the past. Doctors, chiropractors
and physical therapists in turn had 45 days to bill insurers from
the day of treatment - they previously had 180.
</P>
<P>
   In order to meet those deadlines, Wilson said VIP Billing nearly
tripled its staff to handle its regular account load of about 100
medical providers.
</P>
<P>
   The company found some relief when a state Supreme Court struck
down the revised regulations in June.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, however, the state Insurance Department
reintroduced almost the exact same changes to the no-fault
insurance rules. The department, which plans to institute the
changes in Nov. 1, said the changes were necessary to fight
increasing numbers of fraudulent filings, many of which are
no-fault claims.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to provide a better time period to reconstruct an
accident,'' department spokeswoman Joanna Rose said. ''Reporting an
accident three months later or medical problems six months later
make that difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't calm Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to lose our accounts because we're not going to
keep up ... I'm afraid I can't afford it,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   VIP Billing is not alone, said Suzanne Mattei of the New York
State Trial Lawyers Association. Mattei said while it's unclear if
shortening the time frame will halt fraudulent claims, it's certain
that consumers, medical providers and billing firms will have to
scramble to meet the deadlines and likely face ''severe financial
stress.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If the department is concerned about fraud, let's strengthen
the no-fault fraud unit which target the people who cause the harm.
Let's not penalize the honest citizens,'' Mattei said.
</P>
<P>
   The no-fault laws known as ''Regulation 68'' require insurers to
cover anyone injured in an accident, regardless of who caused it.
Under the rules, if a person is injured in a vehicle accident,
their own vehicle insurer pays medical bills. If the injured person
is not insured, then the insurer of the other vehicle pays.
</P>
<P>
   Mattei said consumers can miss the 30-day deadline for
legitimate reasons like mistaking who was the responsible party in
an accident. Some auto accident victims may also initially downplay
medical problems that could turn out to be quite serious. But
tighter deadlines may make those discoveries too late, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mattei said she saw insurers turn away such valid excuses,
leaving consumers without any benefits. Though it's possible to
challenge these denials in court, it is probably too expensive and
time-consuming, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Trial Lawyers Association was one of several professional
and consumer groups that filed a lawsuit against the Insurance
Department when changes to Regulation 68 were implemented in
February. Other groups that joined the suit included the New York
Public Interest Research Group and the Medical Society of the State
of New York.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Phyllis
Gangel-Jacob overturned the changes to Regulation 68, ruling that
the department failed to follow the state's public notice
requirements in drafting the regulations.
</P>
<P>
   NYPIRG's Russ Haven said it was ''surprising'' that the
Insurance Department would resurrect the same changes following the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''It almost appears inevitable that we'll end up in court
again,'' Haven said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rose stressed that the changes were struck down in court on
procedural grounds, ''not on the basis and merits of the
regulation.''
</P>
<P>
   State records show that suspected fraudulent claims went up
nearly threefold since 1992, and a majority of those were filed as
no-fault claims, she said.
</P>
<P>
   When the department reintroduced the changes in August, it
provided a state-mandated 45-day public comment period that ended
last Monday. Nevertheless, critics charged that the process was
still too hurried and the timing of the comment period was bad
because if fell right in the middle of summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''The situation doesn't appear like they intended to take the
comments seriously.'' Haven said.
</P>
<P>
   Rose said those charges are ''silly.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll consider all the comments that were received and we look
to moving forward with implementation of the regulation,'' she
said.

<HEADLINE> New York wing of Reform Party backs Hagelin; breaks with national group </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The New York wing of the Reform Party turned
its back Sunday on Pat Buchanan, giving its presidential ballot
line to his rival for the party's hearts and minds, John Hagelin,
and voting to sever ties with the national group.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after handing Hagelin their presidential ballot line for
November, the leaders of New York's Independence Party voted
overwhelmingly to disaffiliate from the national Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sends the right message,'' said Jeff Graham, the state
party's U.S. Senate candidate, after the disaffiliation vote. ''We
should be on record as being against what Buchanan stands for.''
</P>
<P>
   The lone opponent to disaffiliation at the Independence Party's
state convention complained that his fellow state party leaders had
broken a ''moral contract'' with New York voters who had joined the
party.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not what the voters who signed on with the party
bargained for,'' said Thomas Loughlin, a Buchanan supporter from
Utica. He said the move would cause the Independence Party ''lose
clout'' on the national scene.
</P>
<P>
   In backing Hagelin, the Independence Party leaders also rejected
an effort by Ralph Nader to secure the ballot line. Nader is
already on the state's November ballot as the candidate of the
Green Party.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan is also already on the New York ballot, having
circulated petitions to qualify an independent ''Buchanan-Reform''
line.
</P>
<P>
   Nader's effort to win the Independence Party line in New York,
to go with his Green Party line, came apart after his camp refused
to back Graham's Senate candidacy. Graham is facing Democrat
Hillary Rodham Clinton and Republican Rep. Rick Lazio, among
others, in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   While Hagelin has managed to get on the ballot in a dozen states
as the Reform Party candidate, Buchanan has locked up the majority
of such state lines and has been awarded more than $12 million in
federal funds for his campaign by the Federal Election Commission.
The FEC rejected a plea by Hagelin to obtain those funds.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin scored points with leaders of the Independence Party,
meeting this weekend in Albany, simply by showing up at the state
convention on Saturday. He stayed around for Sunday's voting. Nader
and Buchanan had sent representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''Woody Allen once said, 'The world is run by those who show
up,''' Graham told his fellow Independence Party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Nader had his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has not only talked the talk, he has walked the walk,''
said Philip Goldstein, who told the convention Hagelin was ''a
little too much of a snake oil salesman.''

a better than 10-1 margin in the weighted voting.

York's Independence Party, gaining the support of one of its most
prominent leaders, Lenora Fulani, a perennial candidate of the
left-leaning New Alliance Party for everything from governor to

</P>
<P>
   But Fulani broke with the conservative Buchanan before the
Reform Party's national convention over his social views and his
refusal to back her in a move to become state chairwoman of the New
York Independence Party.
</P>
<P>
   As with past Independence Party gatherings, Sunday's turned
contentious at times.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm getting sick and tired of people telling us to shut up,''
said Pauline Finch, a delegate from Syracuse who complained when a
party member who was not a delegate wasn't allowed to speak.
''We're pulling ourselves apart.''
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Police chief's past, present tell two different stories  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ENGLEWOOD, N.J. (AP) - City officials credit new Police Chief
David Bowman with significantly cutting crime and running his
department well in his first year on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Others, including neighbors and officers who work under Bowman,
argue his shady past makes him unfit for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Amid a series of financial problems that date back to 1980,
seven federal tax liens were filed against Bowman for failure to
pay income taxes, he failed to repay at least two personal loans
from the 1990s, and a pending ''whistleblower'' lawsuit alleges he
associated with known illegal gamblers, The Record of Hackensack
reported for Sunday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm no poster boy,'' Bowman told the newspaper. ''But I'm not
John Gotti either, as some would make me out to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowman's detractors include Lt. Scott Jenkins, who brought a
lawsuit under the federal Conscientious Employee Protection Act
claiming that in January 1999, when he began investigating illegal
gambling and numbers rackets in Englewood, then-deputy chief Bowman
tipped off the probe's next target and the gambling ring
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins claims that Bowman used intimidating tactics against him
when he started the investigation, then in May 1999 forced him to
resign as commander of the Internal Affairs Division. The following
month, Bowman became chief.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins' suit also charges that in 1997, he gave Bowman an
$8,000 cash loan and Bowman later gave him three postdated checks
to cover much of the debt that all bounced. Bowman then told
Jenkins that to keep his rank at the time as head of the detective
division, he would have to forgive the loan. Soon afterward, the
lawsuit alleges Jenkins was moved back to night shift and patrol
duty.
</P>
<P>
   Bowman would not comment on the lawsuit or many other issues in
his past, but said allegations he associated with gamblers aren't
credible.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no problem sleeping at night. I have nothing to hide,''
he told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   An officer who spoke the condition of anonymity said it was
tough to ignore Bowman's background.
</P>
<P>
   ''Can you legitimately lead a police department without
integrity and honesty?'' the officer said.
</P>
<P>
   City Manager Robert Benecke said he thought Bowman had put his
problems behind him, but added the city would thoroughly
investigate any new allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Council President Douglas Bern said he believed the financial
issues and gambling charges predated Bowman's tenure as deputy
chief and chief.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were told this person had the abilities to the police chief
and so far that has proved true,'' Bern said.
</P>
<P>
   Other allegations against Bowman disclosed by The Record
include:
</P>
<P>
   -A woman filing a domestic violence complaint against her
gambler husband several years ago spotted Bowman in the police
department and told another officer, ''I know him as Red. He
protects my husband and transports the money to our house.''
</P>
<P>
   -Two months before he was named chief, his driver's license -a
work requirement for all officers - was suspended for failure to
pay a 1995 Newark parking ticket; the fee was paid and the license
restored within a week.
</P>
<P>
   State Division of Motor Vehicles records also show that Bowman's
license was suspended three other times during the 1990s: once for
not paying a 1997 Teaneck parking ticket, and twice for writing the
division bad checks for his title and registration.
</P>
<P>
   -Bergen County records show seven federal tax liens totaling
$44,228 were filed against Bowman for failing to pay federal income
taxes in the years 1980 through 1982 and 1985 through 1988. Records
indicate Bowman repaid those taxes, but some liens were not removed
until 1996. He would not comment on the liens.
</P>
<P>
   -Former Englewood resident Charles Burke lent Bowman $7,000,
then had to take him to court and get an order of wage garnishment
in 1998 to get his money back. Former neighbor Eileen Diaz claimed
she went to court to recover a $900 loan made to Bowman in the
early 1990s, but later dropped the issue because of Bowman's
position in the police department.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, city officials note that robberies and assaults are
on pace to be lower than the number last year, and burglaries,
robberies and assaults all have decreased substantially from 1996
to 1999.

<HEADLINE> Panama Mulls Montesinos' Asylum Bid  </HEADLINE>
By KATIA MARTINEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) -- When disgraced former Peru spy chief
Vladimiro Montesinos turned up here unbidden Sunday, Panama was
asked to add him to the string of despised and reviled former
leaders spending their sunset years here.
</P>
<P>
   While some here are tiring of the country's role as a Club Med
for aging strongmen, Panamanian officials said they would
reconsider Montesinos' bid for asylum, in order to help pave the
way for a graceful exit by President Alberto Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once again, Panama is being asked to be the dumping ground for
this type of garbage,'' said former president Guillermo Endara, who
served from 1989 to 1994. Brazil reportedly turned down a similar
request earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hurts that once again we are being asked to be a receptacle
for frightful people,'' Endara said, ''but it's not without virtue,
because Panama is showing solidarity with a sister country going
through a crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   The office of President Mireya Moscoso said in a press statement
that the Organization of American States and other Latin American
presidents had asked Panama to reconsider its decision on Saturday
to refuse asylum for Montesinos.
</P>
<P>
   ''They asked us to reconsider,'' read the statement,
''considering the significance that Mr. Montesinos' leaving Peru
would have for facilitating the democratic process and peace in
that South American country.''
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos, viewed as Fujimori's right-hand man throughout the
1990s, has remained out of sight since mid-September, when Peruvian
broadcasters aired a videotape showing him allegedly bribing an
opposition lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal prompted Fujimori to promise the new elections, in
which he said he would not participate. He also pledged to
dismantle the National Intelligence Service that Montesinos had
headed.
</P>
<P>
   Panama has provided asylum for several disgraced Latin American
leaders in recent years. They include former Ecuadorean President
Abdala Bucaram, whose antics during his brief term earned him the
nickname ''El Loco'' or ''The Crazy One.''
</P>
<P>
   Also here is former Haitian dictator Gen. Raul Cedras, who
toppled President Jean Bertrand Aristide in a 1991 coup, ushering
in a period of human rights violations in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Former Guatemalan president Jorge Serrano Elias, who attempted
to seize absolute power in his country in 1993, is another resident
unlikely to leave. He faces a court judgment in Guatemala for
illegally closing a newspaper while in office.
</P>
<P>
   Panama apparently wanted to draw the line at Montesinos, whom
Peruvian opposition groups want tried at home.
</P>
<P>
   But Assistant Foreign Minister Harmodio Arias hinted that Panama
may grant the asylum request, though he gave no indication when a
decision would be announced. ''If we can help facilitate the
process of democratic transition in Peru, we will,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Endara said any such decision would be ''a great sacrifice by
Panama so that Peru can have democratic change.''

What Role for 'Warriors' in Peace?   
An AP News Analysis
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army's admission that some soldiers on
peacekeeping duty in Kosovo used excessive force against civilians
puts a spotlight on a difficult question for the Pentagon: Would
peacekeeping be more peaceful if the Army had a separate force
trained specifically for such noncombat missions?
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department intends to explore this issue early in
the next administration in reassessing its security strategy and
the shape of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Some foreign policy experts favor creating a separate
constabulary force, with special training in crowd control,
civilian searches, interrogation and other skills. Such a force
would be prepared to go anywhere, for peacekeeping as well as
humanitarian missions. Regular Army combat troops would handle
combat missions.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who have argued this point, retired Army Col.
Richard J. Dunn says the instincts developed by warriors -- to ''be
brutal'' -- are not needed in peacekeeping, which emphasizes using
minimal force.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of creating a ''peace brigade'' within the armed forces
does not play well among today's military leaders, although the
Kosovo case brings it back to the fore.
</P>
<P>
   An Army report released last week said some members of an 82nd
Airborne Division unit, whose motto was ''shoot 'em in the face,''
threatened, abused and beat ethnic Albanian civilians last winter.
The aggression was so egregious that it violated basic standards of
human decency, the report concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Although the misconduct was not widespread, the Army colonel who
wrote the report said the training these paratroopers received
before going to Kosovo failed to temper their ''combat mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the warrior mindset that is essential to success
-- and survival -- on the battlefield can lead to trouble in the more
ambiguous circumstances a soldier encounters on peacekeeping duty.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the unit in Kosovo -- Alpha Company, 3rd
Battalion, 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment -- some soldiers said
they were confused about what peacekeeping meant or were not
prepared for the mission.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our train-up for this ... was nothing like what we came in
contact with when we got here,'' Lt. Samuel Donnelly, an Alpha
Company platoon leader, said in a sworn statement to Army
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that last December, Donnelly slapped around a
teen-age boy who was thought to have information about a shooting.
He and another soldier also were accused of abusing a man they put
in a detention cell.
</P>
<P>
   Another soldier from the same unit, whose name was blacked out
by Army censors, said, ''We expected to get fired at and things
like that. We didn't expect things to be so calm and laid back. I
actually thought it would be more like combat.''
</P>
<P>
   Combat is the primary focus of military training. While the
United States has not fought a land war since the Persian Gulf War
of 1991, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Eric Shinseki is adamant in his
belief that soldiers must be trained for success in the full range
of potential missions -- from peace operations to war.
</P>
<P>
   Shinseki likes to remind people that in Somalia in 1992, U.S.
soldiers intervened to rescue millions from famine and ended up in
a shooting war. In one disastrous battle, 18 American soldiers were
killed and 83 injured in October 1993, prompting President Clinton
to begin withdrawing the force.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the noblest of intentions, a U.S. peacekeeping
operation can turn deadly with little notice, said Shinseki, a
former commander of U.S. peacekeepers in Bosnia, in a speech to
National Guard members on Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   ''Someone else can change the parameters in about 20 minutes,
and we will find our youngsters in the middle of a hot firefight.
That's reality,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   George Joulwan, the retired four-star Army general who was
commander of NATO forces when the Bosnia peacekeeping effort began
in 1995, agrees with Shinseki.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to have soldiers and quality leaders who can adjust to
the mission,'' Joulwan said in an interview Friday. ''We're
flexible enough as an Army, in my opinion, to make those kinds of
adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   Army Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, also opposes creating a separate peacekeeping force. The
best argument against it, he says, is the disastrous U.S. entry
into the Korean War in 1950. In the years immediately after World
War II, the Army partially demobilized and focused its attention
largely on occupation duties in Germany and Japan. Combat training
was put off.
</P>
<P>
   When communist North Korea invaded South Korea, U.S. troops were
ill-prepared for high-intensity combat.
</P>
<P>
   ''Training for combat is especially important when conducting
missions other than war,'' Shelton wrote in this summer's volume of
National Security Studies Quarterly. ''As Korea clearly
demonstrated, we can never be sure when those warfighting skills
will be needed.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Making Rounds in California  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- President Clinton predicted Sunday that
Democrats could win a slim majority in the House but still will
have to get along with the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be an effort for bipartisan cooperation no matter
what happens in the next election, because if we win the majority
it won't be so big that we won't have to work with them,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   The president spoke at a fund-raiser for Rep. Lois Capps, a
Santa Barbara Democrat targeted by the GOP this year. The event was
expected to raise an estimated $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   A swing of just six seats in the Republicans' current 222-211
majority could return the House to Democratic control for the first
time since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was making the rounds of two swing districts in
California this weekend. The Capps stop followed a Saturday visit
to San Jose to help Democratic hopeful Mike Honda raise an
estimated $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   At Sunday's event, Clinton offered only cautious hope for a
Democratic majority in the Senate, where the Republican majority is
54-46.
</P>
<P>
   ''We might even win the Senate back, but if we do it will just
be by a seat or so,'' Clinton said. First lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton hopes to hold on to the Democratic Senate seat now occupied
by retiring New York Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   The Capps fund-raiser marked the 139th time this year that
Clinton has headlined campaign events for congressional Democrats --
a fund-raising record for a president.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, Clinton brought in an estimated $4.4 million
for House Democrats at a lavish affair in the exclusive Brentwood
section of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Pausing along the lucrative weekend hunt for campaign cash among
Hollywood moguls and Silicon Valley dot-com wealth, Clinton also
announced expansion of the federal scenic protected area around Big
Sur.
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service paid $4.5 million for 784 acres at the
southern entrance to the protected forest land around Big Sur,
where spectacular views of ocean ringed by towering cliffs draw
millions of tourists every year.
</P>
<P>
   The parcel around San Carpoforo Creek will be added to the
1.75-million-acre Los Padres National Forest in central California.
</P>
<P>
   The new land is tiny by comparison to the vast acreage already
under federal protection around Big Sur but carries large symbolic
value.
</P>
<P>
   It represents one of Clinton's last opportunities to expand his
environmental legacy and an opportunity to confer further
environmental and conservation bona fides to Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''The work we have done on conservation is among the things I'm
most proud of today,'' Clinton told the California chapter of the
League of Conservation Voters. The national nonprofit environmental
group that recently endorsed Gore for president
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he and Gore have tried to further the conservation
legacy that President Theodore Roosevelt began nearly a century
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''For more than seven years now, Al Gore and I have fought to do
that, most of the time with a Congress that was very hostile to our
environmental objectives,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and his GOP presidential rival, Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, want to pocket California and its 54 electoral votes -- a
fifth of the 270 needed for the presidency. On Monday, Bush is to
begin a five-day West Coast campaign swing that includes
California.
</P>
<P>
   The money for the latest expansion comes from Clinton's 2000
land conservation budget, a pot of about $650 million that was the
subject of a long partisan struggle in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Through two terms, Clinton has secured stronger protection for
tens of millions of acres of scenic or threatened land and
frequently angered Republicans in the process.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Clinton set aside 355,000 acres to protect ancient
groves of giant sequoias. Clinton made the trees a protected
monument under the 1906 Antiquities Act, which allows presidents to
safeguard, without congressional approval, objects of historic and
scientific interest.

<HEADLINE> Israelis Sympathize With Ambassador  </HEADLINE>
By DINA KRAFT
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- In a country where rule-breaking has always
been the rule, the American penchant for laws and regulations has
long been the butt of jokes -- but no one's laughing now that the
U.S. ambassador's security clearance has been suspended for sloppy
handling of sensitive materials.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis sympathized with Martin Indyk -- admired here for his
dedication to peacemaking -- and scorned an unforgiving American
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mishap that is liable to dash his career could only have
happened in America,'' wrote columnist Nahum Barnea in Sunday's
Yediot Ahronot. He blamed the suspension on ''American stiffness.''
</P>
<P>
   Indyk's indiscretion involved the use of an unclassified,
government-owned laptop computer to prepare classified memorandums
about discussions with foreign leaders, said a source outside the
State Department who is familiar with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I regret that my trying to do the best possible job under very
difficult conditions has led to the temporary suspension of my
security clearances,'' Indyk said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Eitan Haber, who has been Indyk's friend since the heady days of
the peace process's launching in 1993 -- President Clinton had just
hired Indyk as an adviser, and Haber was a senior aide to Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin -- said the ambassador was guilty only of
enthusiasm for his job.
</P>
<P>
   ''He took his work home with him,'' Haber told Israel TV. ''We
all do.''
</P>
<P>
   The same laws in Israel are universally honored in the breach,
Haber said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the laws were applied, the truth is, myself and virtually
every Cabinet minister would all be sitting next to Arieh Deri,'' a
former interior minister jailed recently for bribe-taking.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis pride themselves on rule-breaking -- according to their
national myth, it's how the small state survived surrounded by
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   The informal social culture easily accommodated Indyk, a blunt
Australian who appeared tieless at some functions, but who was also
valued because of his dedication.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is a walking database -- which now perhaps sounds like an
insult -- on the details of the conflict and the peace process,''
said acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami.
</P>
<P>
   After a stint heading the State Department's Near East bureau,
Indyk began his second term here as ambassador, asked back by Prime
Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   As a known friend of Israel -- he worked a while for the
pro-Israel lobby in the United States -- Israelis regarded him with
warmth; yet he was useful to the Clinton administration when it
wanted it made clear Israel was crossing a red line -- Israelis knew
he wasn't bluffing.
</P>
<P>
   That earned him the derision of ultra-hawks here, who suspected
he was a Jewish turncoat selling out Israel's store. One
ultranationalist, Rehavam Zeevi, once described him as a ''Jewboy''
and challenged him to a fistfight.

<HEADLINE> Historic soft-money agreement in NY Senate race  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - It's a historic development in the nation's
most-watched Senate race: Hillary Rodham Clinton and her Republican
opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio, banned soft-money ads, paid for by their
respective parties, from their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, as both sides jostled to take credit, watchdog groups
cheered - but also expressed skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've never had two candidates agree not to spend money that
they could have had,'' said Larry Makinson of the Center for
Responsive Politics in Washington, D.C. ''I'm surprised. And like
the campaigns themselves, I'm a little wary that it will stick.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The best thing about it is that it shows they're trying to
address soft money; the worst thing is, we think it's more politics
than actual reform,'' said Rachel Leon, executive director of
Common Cause-NY. ''If the candidates wanted to show they're serious
about this, they would both pledge to pass a soft-money ban when
they're elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates have pledged support for such a law. Lazio said
Sunday on ABC's ''This week'' that the voluntary agreement between
the two campaigns showed ''we can lead without a law being in
place.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaigns reached a deal late Saturday that prohibits the
political parties endorsing them from airing TV and radio ads
boosting their candidates or attacking their opponents. That
applies to the Republican and Conservative parties on his side and
the Democratic, Liberal and Working Families parties on her side.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement does not ban direct mail or get-out-the-vote
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money refers to unlimited funds collected by political
parties. While hard money contributions, limited to $2,000 per
donor, can be used for ads that advocate voting for or against a
candidate, soft money can only be used to advocate an issue, boost
a candidate or attack a candidate, rather than stating, ''Vote for
so-and-so.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's campaign has already raised millions of dollars in
soft money; Lazio's campaign does not have its own soft-money
account but has benefited from soft-money spending by outside
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio also has more hard money than Clinton, so the soft-money
ban could give him an advantage. The latest federal filings showed
his campaign had $10.2 million to her $7.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Lazio's campaign aides worked on the presidential
primary for Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who made campaign finance
reform his biggest issue.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who planned to campaign with Lazio in New York on
Monday, praised the ''bold agreement'' on soft money. ''The New
York race would have been one of the most soft-money controlled
elections in the history of Senate elections,'' he said, ''but
these two candidates have taken a risk that can only benefit the
future of our democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's campaign first proposed a ban on soft-money spending
in December, back when the Republican candidate was New York City
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, a Long Island congressman who replaced Giuliani after the
mayor dropped out due to prostate cancer, brought the issue to a
head when he strode over to Clinton during a televised debate Sept.
13 and waved a contract to ban soft money in her face.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio took heat for what some critics characterized as
''aggressive'' badgering of the first lady, but on Sunday, he told
ABC: ''If I didn't make that point as emphatically as I did, we
wouldn't have this agreement now.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton initially refused to sign the proposal because it did
not compel outside organizations to refrain from soft-money
spending.
</P>
<P>
   But Lazio secured agreements from most of the independent groups
supporting him, and Clinton's campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson
said Sunday their side is urging groups supporting her to to
refrain as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a real big if there,'' said Makinson. ''You're counting
on the self-control of outside groups.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Abortion Rights Action League, which already paid
for one TV commercial attacking Lazio and had begun producing
another, said that for now, it will hold off airing the second ad,
according to NARAL spokesman Bob Jaffe.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the group will step up other efforts to try to persuade
voters that Clinton is stronger on abortion rights issues. On
''This Week,'' Lazio said he would not use Roe vs. Wade as a litmus
test for Supreme Court nominees. Clinton has repeatedly said she
would never vote for a judge who did not support abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   A half dozen NARAL protesters dogged Lazio at a Korean festival
in Queens on Sunday, shouting ''Hey Rick, what about the judges?''
</P>
<P>
   Violations of the soft money pact will be punished reciprocally,
meaning that if one side buys $100,000 worth of air time, the other
side can do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides jockeyed to take credit.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have an historic agreement. That wouldn't have happened
unless my campaign showed leadership,'' Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it was not to his advantage, he would not be doing it,''
Wolfson said, adding: ''We are hopeful but wary.''

Casinos not shy about giving money to Lott, others
<TEXT>
<P>
   BILOXI, Miss. (AP) - Two companies with coast casinos and the
Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians rank among the top gambling
industry contributors to this year's federal elections.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent report by the Center for Responsible
Politics lists Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., among
the top 20 recipients of gambling industry money in the 2000
federal election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   But gambling dollars make up only a small portion of the
senator's nearly $3.8 million election-year bankroll.
</P>
<P>
   The gambling industry's growing clout on Capitol Hill is clearly
illustrated in the report.
</P>
<P>
   The industry since 1990 has made $24.1 million in political
contributions, with $14 million coming in the form of ''soft
money,'' $3 million from political action committees and $7 million
in payments from industry executives.
</P>
<P>
   About $18.5 million of the contributions came during the 1996,
1998 and 2000 election-year cycles, a period during which
commercial casinos and American Indian tribal government gambling
operations spread from Nevada and Atlantic City to 28 states.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's political giving in 1990 amounted to only
$361,169.
</P>
<P>
   ''This controversial industry contributes big political dollars
from a relatively small donor pool, comprised of casinos,
racetracks and Indian gaming operations,'' the Center for
Responsible Politics said on its Web site, www.opensecrets.org.
</P>
<P>
   ''As gambling has become more geographically widespread, the
industry's largesse to federal candidates and parties has risen
dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   But when compared to the 123 other industries profiled in the
center's report, gambling companies are not very big players. In
the 2000 election cycle, during which gambling companies have
contributed about $6 million, insurance companies have given $28.8
million, oil and gas consortiums have donated $21.5 million,
pharmaceutical companies have contributed $16 million and banks
have given $14.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''The numbers are revealing and, in a sense, humbling for the
gamers,'' said Jon Ralston, a Las Vegas-based political analyst and
columnist. ''The gamers may have become players on the Capitol
scene and have acquired influence through lobbying prowess and
selective use of donations. But in that arena, unlike their
fiefdoms in Carson City and Las Vegas, they remain dwarfs.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Feldman, vice president of corporate affairs for MGM
Mirage, parent company for Beau Rivage in Biloxi and the industry's
leading political contributor, said: ''In terms of a percentage of
revenues, what we give is very small. And compared to the amounts
given by other industries it's also very small. It's only a sexy
issue for a liberal group like the Center for Responsible Politics,
which is out to demonize the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott ranks 15th on the list of those benefitting most from
gambling industry dollars, having so far received $23,000 toward
his 2000 election campaign, according to the center's report.
</P>
<P>
   Lott has been called upon by the industry to intercede in a
number of issues, ranging from tax measures and cash transaction
reporting laws to congressional efforts to outlaw wagering on
college sports.
</P>
<P>
   Harrah's Entertainment, which operates casinos in New Orleans
and upstate Tunica County, is one of 21 companies ranked 10th on
the list of individual contributors to Lott's campaign, each giving
$10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Casino companies are not on the list of top 20 industry
contributors to Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., who is up for
re-election in 2002. But Mirage Resorts is listed as one of 13
contributors giving $5,000 to the Mississippi senator.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Gene Taylor, who is up for re-election in November, is
the only one of five Mississippi congressmen listed in the center's
report as receiving casino contributions in the 2000 election
cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling companies rank 17th on the list of top 20 industry
contributors to the Bay St. Louis Democrat, according to the
report, with total donations of $2,600. Casino companies are not
listed among the top 20 individual contributors to Taylor's
election bid.

<HEADLINE> French Approve 5-Year President Term  </HEADLINE>
By DEBORAH SEWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- French voters easily approved a referendum Sunday
on shortening the presidential term to five years, according to
early projections, but dismal turnout was likely to deprive the
country's leaders of any major political gain from the change aimed
at modernizing French politics.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 99 percent of the vote counted, the Interior
Ministry said the measure was approved by 73 percent of voters,
with 27 percent voting against. Voter abstention was nearly 70
percent, a record.
</P>
<P>
   The referendum failed to interest voters, and the abysmal
turnout indicated that many French voters were more concerned about
social, wage and educational issues than political reform.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after the polls closed, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
said he regretted the low turnout, adding that ''I am happy for
this reform that I called for'' and saying he hoped for even more
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac, who had opposed the constitutional
change until recently, told his countrymen in an address on
nationwide television after the polls closed that ''Your democratic
power is going to be reinforced.''
</P>
<P>
   However, many politicians, ranging from far right leader
Jean-Marie Le Pen to the Communists to the Greens on the left,
disparaged the referendum, while veteran conservative Charles
Pasqua of the Rally for France party expressed concern.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am sad for democracy when you see such a lack of interest.
It's worrying,'' said Pasqua, a Chirac rival who may run for
president in the next elections in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The reform's proponents believe cutting the term from seven to
five years will give French voters a chance to elect their head of
state more often and lower the risk of ''cohabitation,'' an often
unwieldy situation that arises when the president and the prime
minister come from opposing parties.
</P>
<P>
   Polls leading up to Sunday's vote showed widespread apathy for
the proposal -- one of the most siginficant changes since the
current constitution went into effect 42 years go. The reform could
have been made by a vote of a joint session of both houses of the
French parliament rather than a referendum.
</P>
<P>
   The French president's term is the longest -- along with Ireland
-- in Europe, and the reform was supposed to bring the term of
France's most powerful office more in line with other major
democracies.
</P>
<P>
   The French president is commander in chief of the armed forces,
appoints the prime minister, has the power to dissolve the National
Assembly, France's parliament and is traditionally France's top
voice in foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Previous French presidents have tried -- and failed -- to change
the seven-year term, which has been in place since 1873.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reduce the term received an impetus after former
President Francois Mitterrand's 14-year stint in office. Critics of
the presidential term said power had stagnated toward the end of
Mitterrand's term and that nearly a decade and a half in office was
too long in the fast-changing, modern world.
</P>
<P>
   Both Chirac and Jospin, who are expected to face off in
presidential elections in two years, favored the change and were
likely to suffer little more than embarrassment over the abysmal
turnout.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of interest among the French in Sunday's vote beat the
record set in a 1988 referendum on the French territory of New
Caledonia, when 63 percent of voters abstained. Including Sunday's
vote, there have been nine referendums since the birth of the Fifth
Republic in 1958. In his TV speech, Chirac promised to make greater
use of the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the seriousness of the proposed change, the public was
uninterested.
</P>
<P>
   Pocketbook issues, including high gas taxes that sparked a
weeklong trucker's protest this month, wages, education and health
care reform seemed far more important.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the long term say it contributes to political
stability. Its opponents claim the mandate is too long and reform
is needed so voters can be consulted more often in today's rapidly
changing world.
</P>
<P>
   Voters on Sunday were asked one question: ''Do you approve the
proposed constitutional law fixing the term of the presidential
mandate to five years?''
</P>
<P>
   If the change is approved, the president elected in 2002
elections would be the first to have the five-year term.

<HEADLINE> Snow Storm Hits Wyoming  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) -- A snow storm that blanketed
much of
Wyoming, shutting down highways and stranding travelers through the
weekend, turned its fury on Colorado and Nebraska on Sunday and set
a record for early snowfall in Cheyenne.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The capital city had recorded 10.5 inches of snow by Sunday
morning, but warming temperatures through the afternoon were
quickly melting the accumulation.
</P>
<P>
   By evening, only a couple of inches remained on the ground in
Cheyenne as the brunt of the storm plowed through the mountains of
Colorado and headed into the Plains, pulling down tree branches and
causing power outages. A week earlier, Denver had set a temperature
record with its 61st day at 90 degrees or above.
</P>
<P>
   The last comparable September snowfall for Cheyenne hit Sept.
28, 1985, when a storm left 4.9 inches of snow across the city. On
Sept. 18, 1942, 4 inches fell, according to the National Weather
Service.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,200 travelers who had been stranded overnight in
Rawlins and Rock Springs -- some for two days -- began moving out on
Sunday as Interstate 80 was reopened across the state one section
at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Stranded trucks parked along both sides of the highway, and the
mass exodus of previously stranded drivers caused traffic
bottlenecks outside each city, the Wyoming Highway Patrol said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had 15 miles in Rawlins that was nothing but a parking lot
for trucks,'' said Don Brinkman, chairman of the Red Cross branch
in Carbon County.
</P>
<P>
   More than 500 travelers spent Saturday night at a Red Cross
shelter set up at the Rawlins Family Recreation Center, and about
400 others stayed at the Wyoming National Guard armory in town.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of these are from California trying to go to Illinois,
New York, down to Colorado Springs, just all over the place,''
Brinkman said.
</P>
<P>
   Other traveler ended up in churches and a former train depot
after the hotels filled up. Four hundred holed up in Rock Springs
at an events complex and a recreation center.
</P>
<P>
   ''This town, the whole area, is just bumper to pumper trucks,
cars moving vans you name it,'' said Judy Valentine, Sweetwater
County emergency management coordinator, who was in Rock Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday evening, a 12-car pileup on Interstate 80 just east of
Laramie delayed a University of Nevada bus and postponed for an
hour a football game at the University of Wyoming in Laramie. There
were no major injuries.

<P>
   Tom and Linda Vaught, of Wichita, Kan., had planned to spend a
week camping in Yellowstone National Park. Instead they felt lucky
just having a hotel room in Laramie.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've never been stuck like this, ever,'' Tom Vaught said.
''We'll always remember Laramie.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaught said he went to the local Wal-Mart looking for gloves and
found none. ''I asked the lady where all the gloves were and she
said the Nevada football team came in and cleaned us out,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the storm dumped up to 15 inches of snow in
Colorado's northern mountains and about 6 inches along the lower
elevations of the Front Range. Power outages were reported across
Larimer County, about 62 miles north of Denver, as the snow
collected on leafy trees and snapped branches, said Carl Burroughs
of the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   Farther east, the storm covered the western half of Nebraska.
Nearly 9 inches fell at Harrisburg, near the Wyoming state line,
and about 6&AMP;frac12; inches fell at Scottsbluff.
</P>
<P>
   Freezing temperatures were expected there into early Monday,
with sunshine and warmer readings forecast by afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Failing the Falls: City doesn't take advantage of resource  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW Z. GALARNEAU
<TEXT>
<P>
   NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y. (AP) - Niagara's mighty waterfalls drew 7.5
million tourists last year.
</P>
<P>
   So where are the attractions, restaurants and shopping that
today's traveler expects to find in a famous tourist destination?
</P>
<P>
   On the New York side of the natural wonder, the last new tourist
development here opened - and closed - nine years ago. Falls
Street, once the main tourist promenade, is a deserted pedestrian
mall. A government study found that the average tourist spends only
four hours here.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Niagara Falls, Ont., has seen more than $1 billion in
new projects started since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Sightseers are spending their vacation budgets elsewhere. The
New York side's 3,000 hotel and motel rooms are filled by paying
guests about half the time, while the Ontario side's 12,500 rooms
have an occupancy rate of about 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   All troubling signs in a city whose population has fallen by
nearly half since 1960, where unemployment is twice the national
average and the city government is struggling to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   Those close to the city blame poor urban planning, shortsighted
politics and serious business misjudgments for the city's troubles.
Some of the biggest barriers to development have come at the hands
of local and state government and include:
</P>
<P>
   -Placing the Robert Moses Parkway along the gorge, preventing
tourists from getting close to the natural wonder.
</P>
<P>
   -A flawed urban renewal plan that created a downtown shunned by
tourists and left the city vulnerable to ill-fated deals.
</P>
<P>
   -Battles among City Hall, developers and local business
interests that tied up key land and tarnished the city's business
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The single worst thing right now is the lack of existing
successes to point to,'' said former city Development Director
Larry Krizan. ''People want to invest where others are already
making money. The fact is, if you're looking for those successes in
downtown Niagara Falls, right now there's not much to point to.''
</P>
<P>
   Seen as one of the biggest and first errors, the parkway built
in the 1950s severed the connection between the city and the falls.
</P>
<P>
   Several times, state government promised to take up at least
part of the parkway to improve pedestrian access but the promises
were unfulfilled until 1980 when the state cut part the highway.
The state again is studying removal of parts of the highway.
</P>
<P>
   Urban renewal clear-cut downtown in 1965 with an eye toward
rebuilding things like a convention center, shopping malls, motels,
parking ramps, shops and other attractions.
</P>
<P>
   The razing went well. The rebuilding fell flat.
</P>
<P>
   A convention center blocked traffic flow to the falls and an
indoor arboretum was constructed along a pedestrian mall in 1977,
sealing off the flow of sightseers into the city.
</P>
<P>
   An economic downturn and the city's fiscal crisis in the
mid-1970s - when it faced bankruptcy - further cooled business in
Niagara Falls, scaring away private developers and their money.
</P>
<P>
   And for years, politics demanded developers be local or be gone.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, local attorney Jack Gellman represented Forest City
Enterprises, a Cleveland development firm that proposed one of the
first major downtown plans, including a shopping mall, department
stores, motels and parking facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ''They threw him out,'' said Tom Sottile, a longtime city
councilman and former Urban Renewal Agency board member. ''They
treated him like a foreigner. I was flabbergasted.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, a key parcel at the foot of the Rainbow Bridge,
the international gateway to the city, went to Occidental Chemical
for an office building. Up went two parking ramps next to it,
turning an unappealing face to visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The city carved a shopping mall into the center of its second
parking ramp. Today, the Rainbow Centre Factory Outlets contain an
Off-Track Betting parlor, T-shirt shops and a food court.
</P>
<P>
   Niagara Falls' most notorious urban renewal failures, Falls
Street Faire and the Niagara Splash Park, have been empty, forlorn
and crumbling for years. The developer of the $50 million project,
Niagara Venture, received $15 million from the government.
</P>
<P>
   By 1992, it was bankrupt. Lawsuits were followed by countersuits
and, finally, an investigation of the developer by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation and a guilty plea by one of the developer's
partners to a charge of tax fraud.

Yugoslavs Turn Out for Chaotic Vote
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Slobodan Milosevic was locked in a tight race
that could spell the end of his 13 years in power after Yugoslavs turned out in
large numbers Sunday for a chaotic vote that poll watchers said was marked by
widespread irregularities. Sensing a dramatic turn, a huge crowd of opposition
supporters streamed into the streets of downtown Belgrade late Sunday to await
official results. There were no immediate reports of clashes. No official
results had been released hours after polls closed. However, opposition leaders
described the first returns as encouraging. Milosevic's own party indicated he
was leading with barely enough to avoid a runoff Oct. 8.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dick Cheney declined to say today whether he completed the
entire questionnaire that was given to all of George W. Bush's potential running
mates. ''I went through the same vetting process that virtually everybody else
did,'' said Cheney, who ran the GOP presidential candidate's search for a No. 2
before Bush chose him for the job. The Washington Post reported today that
questions about the millions of dollars Cheney could earn from stock options and
the fact that he did not vote in some local elections in Texas could have been
avoided had he been asked to complete the questionnaire himself. He did not
answer questions about whether he completed all or part of the questionnaire.

reconsider Montesinos' bid for asylum in order to help pave the way for a
graceful exit by President Alberto Fujimori. Montesinos, viewed as Fujimori's
right-hand man throughout the 1990s, has remained out of sight since
mid-September, when Peruvian broadcasters aired a videotape showing him

Clinton Making Rounds in California

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- President Clinton predicted today that Democrats could
win a slim majority in the House but still will have to get along with the
Republicans. The president spoke at a fund-raiser for Rep. Lois Capps, a Santa
Barbara Democrat targeted by the GOP this year. The event was expected to raise
an estimated $200,000. A swing of just six seats in the Republicans' current
222-211 majority could return the House to Democratic control for the first time
since 1994. Clinton was making the rounds of two swing districts in California
this weekend. The Capps stop followed yesterday's visit to San Jose to help
Democratic hopeful Mike Honda raise an estimated $500,000.

   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Sunday that he is

not rule out the possibility that ''a comprehensive agreement will be achieved
on most of the issues, while a time limit will be set for agreement on a very
small part of them,'' his office said in a news release. Palestinian parliament
speaker Ahmed Qureia told reporters ''there has to be agreement on every issue

be the first state to institute such a booster seat rule. A similar law passed
earlier this year in Washington is expected to go into effect shortly after
California would begin in January 2002.Similar legislation has been discussed in
Idaho, Texas and Colorado. In New York, a bill to require boosters seats until
age 7 was sunk by the state Senate.

   BOSTON (AP) -- Starbucks, Green Mountain Coffee, Peet's Coffee and Tea,

new line of coffee purchased from farmers under ''fair trade'' regulations.
Those regulations include paying farmers at least $1.26 per pound, regardless of
how low coffee prices drop on the world market, and paying them 60 percent of
the cost prior to shipment. The two largest coffee importers, Maxwell House and
Folgers, have not signed on to the fair trade initiative led by Oxfam America,
which fights poverty worldwide, and Transfair America, which promotes fair trade

<HEADLINE> Sen. McCain lends hand to Saxton's re-election effort  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MEDFORD, N.J. (AP) - U.S. Sen. and former Republican
presidential candidate John McCain campaigned for U.S. Rep. Jim
Saxton on Sunday at a rally honoring veterans here.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, himself a veteran and perhaps the country's most noted
prisoner of war, talked about improving life for people in the
military.
</P>
<P>
   A naval aviator, McCain was shot down over Vietnam in 1967 and
was held prisoner of war in Hanoi for five and a half years.
</P>
<P>
   He told the 500 people who attended that the country needs to
improve health care for veterans and to guarantee them what the
government promised when they enlisted.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also praised Saxton, describing the congressman as a
respected, effective leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was my pleasure to serve with him in the House of
Representatives when were in the beleaguered minority,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also didn't miss the chance to stump for campaign finance
reform, mentioning the U.S. Senate race between Wall Street
financier Jon Corzine and Republican Bob Franks, who attended the
event.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine has spent more than $40 million on his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''(Franks is) going to show Americans and the world that senate
seats in New Jersey are not for sale,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Saxton called McCain a ''true American hero and patriot.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We've fought many of the same fights in Washington, for lower
taxes, a strong national defense, and reforming our campaign
finance system and I'm proud to have his support,'' said Saxton,
R-Mount Holly, who is seeking a ninth term.
</P>
<P>
   After the rally inside the Lenape High School gym, a
Revolutionary War ceremony, including the firing of a full-size
cannon, was to be held outside.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was to be the featured guest at a fund-raiser for Saxton
in Mount Laurel after the rally.
</P>
<P>
   Saxton is being challenged by Cherry Hill Mayor Susan Bass
Levin. Many of those who attended said Levin is well-financed and
Saxton needs their support.
</P>
<P>
   ''Saxton needs all the help he can get around here,'' said Joe
Painting, 60, a veteran from Medford.
</P>
<P>
   The 3rd district encompasses most of Burlington County and parts
of Ocean and Camden counties.

<HEADLINE> Polls: French OK New President Term  </HEADLINE>
By DEBORAH SEWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- French voters easily approved a referendum Sunday
on shortening the presidential term to five years, according to
early projections, but dismal turnout was likely to deprive the
country's leaders of any major political gain from the change aimed
at modernizing French politics.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 99 percent of the vote counted, the Interior
Ministry said the measure was approved by 73 percent of voters,
with 27 percent voting against. Voter abstention was nearly 70
percent, a record.
</P>
<P>
   The referendum failed to interest voters, and the abysmal
turnout indicated that many French voters were more concerned about
social, wage and educational issues than political reform.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after the polls closed, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
said he regretted the low turnout, adding that ''I am happy for
this reform that I called for'' and saying he hoped for even more
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac, who had opposed the constitutional
change until recently, told his countrymen in an address on
nationwide television after the polls closed that ''Your democratic
power is going to be reinforced.''
</P>
<P>
   However, many politicians, ranging from far right leader
Jean-Marie Le Pen to the Communists to the Greens on the left,
disparaged the referendum, while veteran conservative Charles
Pasqua of the Rally for France party expressed concern.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am sad for democracy when you see such a lack of interest.
It's worrying,'' said Pasqua, a Chirac rival who may run for
president in the next elections in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The reform's proponents believe cutting the term from seven to
five years will give French voters a chance to elect their head of
state more often and lower the risk of ''cohabitation,'' an often
unwieldy situation that arises when the president and the prime
minister come from opposing parties.
</P>
<P>
   Polls leading up to Sunday's vote showed widespread apathy for
the proposal -- one of the most siginficant changes since the
current constitution went into effect 42 years go. The reform could
have been made by a vote of a joint session of both houses of the
French parliament rather than a referendum.
</P>
<P>
   The French president's term is the longest -- along with Ireland
-- in Europe, and the reform was supposed to bring the term of
France's most powerful office more in line with other major
democracies.
</P>
<P>
   The French president is commander in chief of the armed forces,
appoints the prime minister, has the power to dissolve the National
Assembly, France's parliament and is traditionally France's top
voice in foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Previous French presidents have tried -- and failed -- to change
the seven-year term, which has been in place since 1873.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reduce the term received an impetus after former
President Francois Mitterrand's 14-year stint in office. Critics of
the presidential term said power had stagnated toward the end of
Mitterrand's term and that nearly a decade and a half in office was
too long in the fast-changing, modern world.
</P>
<P>
   Both Chirac and Jospin, who are expected to face off in
presidential elections in two years, favored the change and were
likely to suffer little more than embarrassment over the abysmal
turnout.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of interest among the French in Sunday's vote beat the
record set in a 1988 referendum on the French territory of New
Caledonia, when 63 percent of voters abstained. Including Sunday's
vote, there have been nine referendums since the birth of the Fifth
Republic in 1958. In his TV speech, Chirac promised to make greater
use of the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the seriousness of the proposed change, the public was
uninterested.
</P>
<P>
   Pocketbook issues, including high gas taxes that sparked a
weeklong trucker's protest this month, wages, education and health
care reform seemed far more important.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the long term say it contributes to political
stability. Its opponents claim the mandate is too long and reform
is needed so voters can be consulted more often in today's rapidly
changing world.
</P>
<P>
   Voters on Sunday were asked one question: ''Do you approve the
proposed constitutional law fixing the term of the presidential
mandate to five years?''
</P>
<P>
   If the change is approved, the president elected in 2002
elections would be the first to have the five-year term.

<HEADLINE> Western Snow Storm Spreads  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) -- A snow storm that blanketed
much of
Wyoming, shutting down highways and stranding travelers through the
weekend, turned its fury on Colorado and Nebraska on Sunday and set
a record for early snowfall in Cheyenne.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The capital city had recorded 10.5 inches of snow by Sunday
morning, but warming temperatures through the afternoon were
quickly melting the accumulation.
</P>
<P>
   By evening, only a couple of inches remained on the ground in
Cheyenne as the brunt of the storm plowed through the mountains of
Colorado and headed into the Plains, pulling down tree branches and
causing power outages. A week earlier, Denver had set a temperature
record with its 61st day at 90 degrees or above.
</P>
<P>
   The last comparable September snowfall for Cheyenne hit Sept.
28, 1985, when a storm left 4.9 inches of snow across the city. On
Sept. 18, 1942, 4 inches fell, according to the National Weather
Service.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,200 travelers who had been stranded overnight in
Rawlins and Rock Springs -- some for two days -- began moving out on
Sunday as Interstate 80 was reopened across the state one section
at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Stranded trucks parked along both sides of the highway, and the
mass exodus of previously stranded drivers caused traffic
bottlenecks outside each city, the Wyoming Highway Patrol said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had 15 miles in Rawlins that was nothing but a parking lot
for trucks,'' said Don Brinkman, chairman of the Red Cross branch
in Carbon County.
</P>
<P>
   More than 500 travelers spent Saturday night at a Red Cross
shelter set up at the Rawlins Family Recreation Center, and about
400 others stayed at the Wyoming National Guard armory in town.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of these are from California trying to go to Illinois,
New York, down to Colorado Springs, just all over the place,''
Brinkman said.
</P>
<P>
   Other traveler ended up in churches and a former train depot
after the hotels filled up. Four hundred holed up in Rock Springs
at an events complex and a recreation center.
</P>
<P>
   ''This town, the whole area, is just bumper to pumper trucks,
cars moving vans you name it,'' said Judy Valentine, Sweetwater
County emergency management coordinator, who was in Rock Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday evening, a 12-car pileup on Interstate 80 just east of
Laramie delayed a University of Nevada bus and postponed for an
hour a football game at the University of Wyoming in Laramie. There
were no major injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Tom and Linda Vaught, of Wichita, Kan., had planned to spend a
week camping in Yellowstone National Park. Instead they felt lucky
just having a hotel room in Laramie.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've never been stuck like this, ever,'' Tom Vaught said.
''We'll always remember Laramie.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaught said he went to the local Wal-Mart looking for gloves and
found none. ''I asked the lady where all the gloves were and she
said the Nevada football team came in and cleaned us out,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the storm dumped up to 15 inches of snow in
Colorado's northern mountains and about 6 inches along the lower
elevations of the Front Range. Power outages were reported across
Larimer County, about 62 miles north of Denver, as the snow
collected on leafy trees and snapped branches, said Carl Burroughs
of the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   Farther east, the storm covered the western half of Nebraska.
Nearly 9 inches fell at Harrisburg, near the Wyoming state line,
and about 6&AMP;frac12; inches fell at Scottsbluff.
</P>
<P>
   Freezing temperatures were expected there into early Monday,
with sunshine and warmer readings forecast by afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Problems Cited in Yugoslavian Vote  </HEADLINE>
By DUSAN STOJANOVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Slobodan Milosevic was locked in a
bitter election race Sunday that could spell the end of his 13
years in power, after Yugoslavs turned out in large numbers in a
chaotic vote that poll watchers said was marked by widespread
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after polls closed, it appeared the best that Milosevic
could hope for was to head into a runoff Oct. 8 against his
strongest challenger, Vojislav Kostunica.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing a dramatic turn, huge crowds of opposition supporters
streamed into the streets of downtown Belgrade late Sunday to await
official results. Helmeted riot police carrying shields and armed
with tear gas launchers cordoned off the group but later withdrew
after a concert by Milosevic's supporters ended.
</P>
<P>
   Similar gatherings were reported in Nis, Novi Sad, Cacak and
several other towns in Yugoslavia's main republic Serbia. There
were no immediate reports of clashes.
</P>
<P>
   No official results had been released as of early Monday.
However, Cedomir Jovanovic, spokesman of the Democratic Opposition
of Serbia, said that based on returns from 45 percent of 10,000
polling stations, Kostunica was leading with 57 percent to 33
percent for Milosevic. Three other candidates are in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that it's absolutely realistic to expect an
election victory of our candidate already in the first round,''
Jovanovic said.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's Socialist Party claimed the president was leading
Kostunica by about 46.87 percent to 38.6 percent based on returns
from 754 polling stations. Neither party gave the number of ballots
counted.
</P>
<P>
   The ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party, Milosevic's partner
in Serbia's government, admitted its candidate, Tomislav Nikolic,
had lost the presidential race. The Radicals said Kostunica was
leading Milosevic by 46.2 percent to 42.7 percent based on returns
from about one-tenth of the polling stations.
</P>
<P>
   Another Kostunica supporter, Zoran Djindjic, predicted Milosevic
would try to manipulate the remaining vote count to force a runoff.
''That will be his strategy,'' Djindjic said.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica had been leading in opinion polls despite a campaign
marred by a crackdown against opposition supporters, one-sided
coverage by the staunchly pro-Milosevic media and the lack of
broad-based foreign monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   During Sunday's voting, monitors reported that some boxes were
stuffed with Milosevic ballots, prominent opposition members were
dropped from registration rolls and voters were forced to cast
ballots publicly.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said it had ''a lot of concerns about this
election.'' Deputy Press Secretary Nanda Chitre pointed to the
monitors' reports, saying, ''These types of things show a pattern
of irregularity that really brings into question the integrity of
the whole process.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States -- which has invested millions of dollars in an
attempt to organize the traditionally fractured Serbian opposition
-- has made ousting Milosevic a major goal, believing there can be
no stability in the Balkans so long as he remains in power.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Free Elections and Democracy, a private group
including human rights workers, lawyers and other volunteers,
reported a turnout of 74.6 percent in Yugoslavia's main republic
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   In the smaller republic of Montenegro -- where the pro-Western
government boycotted the vote -- the turnout was only about 24
percent, the opposition said.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic made no statement about the seemingly unfavorable
returns. Earlier Sunday, he brushed aside accusations that he would
rig the vote to stay in power, predicting prosperity after he wins
and his troubled country is ''cleared up'' politically.
</P>
<P>
   The president's statement, made after he cast his ballot in the
Dedinje district where he lives, may indicate he plans to crack
down hard on political opponents -- whom he has dubbed NATO lackeys
and traitors -- if he's declared the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica, a 56-year-old law professor, said after voting that
he expected to win.
</P>
<P>
   ''The regime is aware that it is losing these elections and that
the people are free from fear to say what they think about such
authorities,'' Kostunica said.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes were especially high in the voting, which also
included selection of a new parliament and municipal governments.
</P>
<P>
   If Milosevic loses, he risks extradition to the U.N. war crimes
tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, which indicted him last year
for atrocities committed by his troops in Kosovo. He may also risk
massive revenge by Yugoslavs tired of being an impoverished pariah
country after a decade of his rule.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union has promised massive aid to Yugoslavia if
Milosevic loses. Montenegro, the smaller republic that along with
Serbia forms present-day Yugoslavia, said it would hold an
independence referendum if Milosevic wins.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's spokesman Nikola Sainovic claimed the Yugoslav
president won ''overwhelmingly'' in Kosovo. However, the chief U.N.
administrator in the province, Bernard Kouchner, said the
''so-called elections did not meet any international and European
standards in terms of democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Free Elections and Democracy reported major
voting irregularities. They included opposition representatives
being kicked out of polling stations or not allowed to inspect
voters' lists, voting boxes and ballots.
</P>
<P>
   At many voting places, police were present in front of polling
stations, and there was public -- instead of secret -- voting in
southern regions of Serbia, according to the center, a
nongovernmental organization which included human rights activists,
lawyers and other pro-democracy volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   In the eastern town of Negotin, opposition representatives were
banned from a polling station but managed to get in by force, only
to find that the ballot boxes had been stuffed in advance with
ballots for Milosevic, the Belgrade-based group said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is an absolute mess in Serbia today,'' said Marko
Blagojevic from independent monitoring group. ''I don't think
elections like this were ever held anywhere, ever since the Stone
Age.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's electoral commission said the vote passed
without irregularities, ''despite Western propaganda.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the examples cited by the monitoring group could not be
confirmed. However, in Kosovo, Western reporters saw cases where
polling stations were never opened, where prominent opposition
members were told their names were not on registration rolls or
where voters had no privacy to mark their ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Others were turned away because their names did not appear on
registration lists. Officials claimed that was a result of the
turmoil that swept Kosovo during last year's conflict, which ended
with the arrival of NATO-led peacekeepers.

<HEADLINE> Both Sides Claim Vote in Macedonia  </HEADLINE>
By KONSTANTIN TESTORIDES
<TEXT>
<P>
   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) -- Both the opposition and the ruling
coalition were declaring victory Sunday based on initial results in
a second round of municipal balloting that was marred by scattered
violence and irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling three-party coalition of Prime Minister Ljubco
Georgievski said its candidates had won in 70 districts, while the
four-party opposition, led by the former communists, said its
candidates were leading in most districts, but did not give
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Before the polls closed in 81 of the country's 123 districts,
three people, including a young girl, had been injured in a
shootout between government and opposition supporters in Strumica,
about 85 miles southeast of the capital, Skopje.
</P>
<P>
   The incident, reported by private Sitel television quoting
opposition sources, was the first of several in the town.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was another round of badly organized elections,'' said
Vladimir Bucovski, a spokesman for the opposition Social Democratic
Alliance of Macedonia, citing voter fraud and intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   Both the opposition and the ruling coalition admitted there were
about 25 incidents across the country. Each accused the other of
racketeering and pressuring voters in the 27 districts where the
vote was repeated, as well as the 54 where a run-off was held.
</P>
<P>
   In Skopje, two polling stations had to be closed down because of
irregularities, including a man grabbing the voters' list from the
local commission and running away, the state electoral commission
said. First results are expected Monday and no turnout figures were
given, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The result will determine the future of Georgievski's coalition,
which has been losing popularity to the center-left cluster of
opposition parties that claimed outright victory in at least 30
districts in the first round of voting two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Election authorities have refused to release official results
from the first round of voting, which the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe said did not meet international
standards.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, ethnic Albanians in the Kondvo neighborhood of Skopje
boycotted the vote, in protest over violence in the first round
that left one man dead and two others injured.
</P>
<P>
   At least one quarter of Macedonia's 2.2 million people are
ethnic Albanians, who demand broader rights and greater self-rule.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia was the only former Yugoslav republic to gain
independence in the early 1990s without war. Last year, the nation
gave shelter to hundreds of thousands of Kosovo Albanian refugees
during NATO's 78-day bombing campaign. Macedonia also allowed
NATO-led peacekeepers to use its territory for subsequent
deployment in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Accuses Guinea of Attack  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) -- Liberia accused Guinea on Sunday of
shelling across their increasingly troubled border, saying the
attack had injured several people.
</P>
<P>
   There was no independent confirmation of Friday's alleged attack
on Liberia's northern district of Zorzor.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions along the border of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone
have grown in recent weeks following Guinea's crackdown on refugees
from its two neighboring West African nations.
</P>
<P>
   Guinea holds more than 460,000 refugees from Liberia and Sierra
Leone, one of the largest refugee populations in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Liberia said it had lodged a formal protest over the latest
alleged shelling, which it said came from the Guinean town of
Koinyamah.
</P>
<P>
   Liberia indicated the alleged attack had injured a number of
people, but gave no details.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Guinea's embassy in Liberia said he had heard
nothing from his government on such an attack.

<HEADLINE> Ivory Coast Leader Skips OAU Summit  </HEADLINE>
By EBOW GODWIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOME, Togo (AP) -- African leaders meeting Sunday on the
increasing political instability in Ivory Coast got a first-hand
glimpse of the tension when the country's military leader stayed
away and barred his political rivals from attending as well.
</P>
<P>
   African leaders had invited Ivory Coast military ruler Gen.
Robert Guei, as well as his political rivals, to the Organization
of African Unity summit. Guei said he was too busy to attend and
sent Premier Diarra Seydou Elimane to Lome, Togo, in his place. But
he also forbade the opposition leaders to leave Ivory Coast.
</P>
<P>
   African leaders were said to be considering sending a delegation
to Ivory Coast to urge Guei to come and let his rivals attend.
</P>
<P>
   Eight African heads of state and two countries' foreign
ministers attended the special session on Ivory Coast, which has
seen political tensions rise since Guei came to power in a
Christmas Eve coup, the country's first mliitary takeover in its
40-year history.
</P>
<P>
   The summit underscored African leaders' concern over what long
had been one of the region's rare stable nations.
</P>
<P>
   Guei has promised elections Oct. 22 to return the West African
nation to civilian government. But his government has yet to say
which, if any political opponents, will be allowed to run against
him for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said the African leaders had intended to press Guei to
open the elections to all the country's political figures.
</P>
<P>
   Guei's government has become increasingly assertive since what
it claims was an attempt on his life by mutinous soldiers on Sept.
18.
</P>
<P>
   Loyalties in the conflict largely have split along ethnic and
regional lines, worrying Ivory Coast's neighbors that any trouble
might spill across the border.
</P>
<P>
   Ivory Coast, which welcomed migrant workers before its economy
hit hard times with falling cocoa prices, hosts millions of
migrants from Burkina Faso, Ghana and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's summit drew heads of state from Nigeria, Algeria, South
Africa, Togo, Senegal, Djibouti, Burkina Faso, Mali and foreign
ministers of Ghana and Gabon.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how long the closed-door talks would continue.

<TEXT>
<P>
   RUSTON, La. (AP) -- A man suspected of making repeated bomb
threats that closed down the Grambling State University campus was
booked into the Lincoln Parish Detention Center on nine counts of
making arson threats.
</P>
<P>
   Police said a man identifying himself as a former student who
had been denied financial aid called several times Friday saying
bombs had been left in six college buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The entire campus was evacuated around 8 a.m., and students were
told to gather in the open-air football stadium. By 10:45 a.m., the
college announced that classes were canceled for the day and many
students left.
</P>
<P>
   No bombs were found, and late Friday, Louisiana State Police
arrested Frank James Cushenberry, 20, of St. Gabriel, said Lincoln
Parish deputy Mike Rainwater. Cushenberry was being held Sunday on
$100,000 bond.
</P>
<P>
   Grambling spokeswoman Vickie Jackson said the man who made the
threats told authorities he had been enrolled as a business major
before being denied financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   The university, with an enrollment of about 4,700, is in north
Louisiana between Shreveport and Monroe.

Milosevic Faces Challenge in Vote
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Slobodan Milosevic was locked in a bitter
election race Sunday that could spell the end of his 13 years in power, after
Yugoslavs turned out in large numbers in a chaotic vote that poll watchers said
was marked by widespread irregularities. Huge crowds of opposition supporters
streamed into the streets of downtown Belgrade late Sunday to await official
results. No official results had been released as of early Monday. However,
Cedomir Jovanovic, spokesman of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia, said that
based on returns from 45 percent of 10,000 polling stations, Vojislav Kostunica
was leading with 57 percent to 33 percent for Milosevic. Three other candidates
are in the race.

not rule out the possibility that ''a comprehensive agreement will be achieved
on most of the issues, while a time limit will be set for agreement on a very
small part of them,'' his office said in a news release. In recent days, his
Cabinet ministers have hinted they would accept a deal that delayed decisions on

GOP presidential candidate's search for a No. 2 before Bush chose him for the

in some local elections in Texas could have been avoided had he been asked to

Clinton Makes Fund-Raising Rounds

Republicans. The president spoke at a fund-raiser for Rep. Lois Capps, a Santa
Barbara Democrat targeted by the GOP this year. The event was expected to raise
an estimated $200,000. A swing of just six seats in the Republicans' current
222-211 majority could return the House to Democratic control for the first time
since 1994. Clinton was making the rounds of two swing districts in California
this weekend. The Capps stop followed yesterday's visit to San Jose to help
Democratic hopeful Mike Honda raise an estimated $500,000.

French Approve 5-Year President Term
</SUBHEAD>

   PARIS (AP) -- French voters easily approved a referendum Sunday on shortening
the presidential term to five years, according to early projections. The
presidential term had been seven years. Dismal turnout was likely to deprive the
country's leaders of any major political gain from the change aimed at
modernizing French politics. Voter abstention was nearly 70 percent, a record.
The referendum failed to interest voters, and the abysmal turnout indicated that
many French voters were more concerned about social, wage and educational issues
than political reform.

   FRIDAY HARBOR, Wash. (AP) -- A body matching the description of a

trip was discovered near Lummi Island, southeast of Bellingham, the
Coast Guard said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and Canadian coast guards had been searching for Grant

</P>
<P>
   The two men, described as experienced kayakers, left Lummi
Island by kayak Wednesday and planned to visit two other islands
before returning to Lummi on Saturday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A small-craft advisory was issued for the area Thursday night,
when the forecast called for winds of 25-30 knots and wind waves
3-5 feet. Fifteen-knot winds and 2- to 4-foot seas were reported in
the area Friday night.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Jailed American woman's father outraged by Peru spy chief's flight to Panama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) - The father of an American woman jailed on
terrorism charges expressed outrage that deposed spy chief
Vladimiro Montesinos was allowed to flee to Panama while his
daughter continues to languish in a Peruvian prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why is Mr. Montesinos above the law?'' Mark Berenson said
Sunday after a one-hour visit with his daughter Lori Berenson, 30,
at a women's prison in Peru's capital, Lima.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1996, the New York native was sentenced to life in
prison by hooded military judges for allegedly helping to plan a
foiled guerrilla attack on Congress. In August, she was granted a
new trial in a civilian court and last week testified she was
neither a member nor a collaborator of the pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement, known as MRTA.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Berenson questioned how the former head of the National
Intelligence Service, known by its Spanish acronym SIN, had been
allowed to get away when he had been so publicly exposed on
videotape apparently bribing an opposition congressman.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Montesinos is guilty of sin in the SIN. It was shown on
video,'' he said after Montesinos' flight to Panama. ''I thought
asylum was given to people who are persecuted, not potentially
prosecuted.''
</P>
<P>
   Peru's highest military court overturned Berenson's sentence
Aug. 28, citing new evidence she was not a Tupac Amaru leader.
Under Peru's terrorism legislation, rebel leaders face charges of
treason in secret military courts.
</P>
<P>
   The decision cleared the way for a new trial in an open civilian
court on a lesser terrorism charge, which carries a minimum
sentence of 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson faces an uphill battle to prove her innocence. The
announcement that she was being granted a new trial sparked an
outcry from a wide spectrum of Peruvian society. For most
Peruvians, who were caught in the cross fire between security
forces and leftist guerrillas in the 1980s and early 1990s, her
guilt is a foregone conclusion.

<HEADLINE> Snow Storm Hits Wyo., Colo., Neb.  </HEADLINE>
By MEAD GRUVER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) -- A snow storm that blanketed much of
Wyoming, shutting down highways and stranding travelers through the
weekend, plowed through Colorado and into western Nebraska early
Sunday and set a record for early snowfall in Cheyenne.
</P>
<P>
   The capital city had recorded 10.5 inches of snow by Sunday
morning, but warming temperatures through the afternoon were
quickly melting the accumulation.
</P>
<P>
   By evening, only a couple of inches of snow remained on the
ground in Cheyenne, and green grass poked through the snow in yards
across Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The brunt of the storm had pulled down tree branches and caused
power outages in Colorado on Saturday night, less than a week after
Denver set a temperature record with its 61st day at 90 degrees or
above.
</P>
<P>
   In Cheyenne, the last comparable early snowfall hit Sept. 28,
1985, when a storm left 4.9 inches of snow across the city,
according to the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,200 travelers who had been stranded overnight in
Rawlins and Rock Springs -- some for two days -- began moving out on
Sunday as Interstate 80 was reopened across Wyoming one section at
a time. Stranded trucks parked along both sides of the highway, and
the mass exodus caused traffic bottlenecks outside each city, the
Wyoming Highway Patrol said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had 15 miles in Rawlins that was nothing but a parking lot
for trucks,'' said Don Brinkman, chairman of the Red Cross branch
in Carbon County.
</P>
<P>
   More than 500 travelers spent Saturday night at a Red Cross
shelter set up at the Rawlins Family Recreation Center, and about
400 others stayed at the Wyoming National Guard armory in town.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of these are from California trying to go to Illinois,
New York, down to Colorado Springs, just all over the place,''
Brinkman said.
</P>
<P>
   Other traveler ended up in churches and a former train depot
after the hotels filled up. Four hundred holed up in Rock Springs
at an events complex and a recreation center.
</P>
<P>
   ''This town, the whole area, is just bumper to pumper trucks,
cars moving vans you name it,'' said Judy Valentine, Sweetwater
County emergency management coordinator, who was in Rock Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday evening, a 12-car pileup on Interstate 80 just east of
Laramie delayed a University of Nevada bus and postponed for an
hour a football game at the University of Wyoming in Laramie. There
were no major injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Tom and Linda Vaught, of Wichita, Kan., had planned to spend a
week camping in Yellowstone National Park. Instead they felt lucky
just having a hotel room in Laramie.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've never been stuck like this, ever,'' Tom Vaught said.
''We'll always remember Laramie.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaught said he went to the local Wal-Mart looking for gloves and
found none. ''I asked the lady where all the gloves were and she
said the Nevada football team came in and cleaned us out,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the storm dumped up to 15 inches of snow in
Colorado's northern mountains and about 6 inches along the lower
elevations of the Front Range. Power outages were reported across
Larimer County, about 62 miles north of Denver, as the snow
collected on leafy trees and snapped branches, said Carl Burroughs

<HEADLINE> Peru Spy Chief Flees To Panama  </HEADLINE>
By BILL CORMIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Peru's ousted spy chief fled Sunday to Panama,
triggering opposition demands that President Alberto Fujimori's
government explain how the former top aide eluded arrest and
prosecution over a bribery scandal at home.
</P>
<P>
   Though Fujimori faced opposition anger, the escape of Vladimiro
Montesinos could resolve for him the potentially dangerous question
of what to do with his former aide, who it was feared could rally
his powerful allies in the military to his side if prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos' pre-dawn flight, made in secrecy, came after Latin
American countries, backed by the United States, urged Panama to
take him in despite its earlier refusal -- apparently to smooth
Peru's way out of its political crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori said nothing about the flight of the man who was at the
center of a bribery scandal that has forced the president to cut
short his rule. Instead, Fujimori attended an annual ceremony
honoring the armed forces, where he praised the intelligence
services and military.
</P>
<P>
   ''The gentleman is in Panama,'' the country's Vice Foreign
Minister Harmodio Arias said, after Montesinos arrived in Panama
shortly after dawn Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   President Mireya Moscoso's office said Latin American leaders
and the Organization of American States had asked Panama to
reconsider an earlier refusal to grant Montesinos asylum.
</P>
<P>
   ''They asked us to reconsider, considering the significance that
Mr. Montesinos' leaving Peru would have for facilitating the
democratic process and peace in that South American country,'' the
office said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman at the U.S. Embassy in Lima, Douglas Barnes, said
the OAS endorsement of taking in Montesinos was ''supported by
countries of the hemisphere, including the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The exact whereabouts of Montesinos had been cloaked in secrecy
since a videotape was aired Sept. 14 apparently showing him bribing
an opposition lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   That sparked demands by opposition leaders that Montesinos --
seen by many as even more powerful than Fujimori -- be arrested and
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori announced two days after the scandal broke that he
would call new elections and not stand as a candidate. He also
vowed to disband Montesinos' spy agency and called for a thorough
criminal probe of the alleged bribery.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the opposition wanted answers about the government's role
in Montesinos' escape.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Olivera, the opposition congressman who revealed the
videotape, said he believed Montesinos' flight to Panama resulted
from a ''shameful intervention'' by Fujimori after it became clear
that top military commanders would sooner replace the president
than let Montesinos be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has been an attitude of outright rebellion,'' he
contended.
</P>
<P>
   ''The entire opposition and the nation have demanded and
continue to demand a fair trial'' for Montesinos, said opposition
Congressman Henry Pease. ''They cannot give him impunity to
escape.''
</P>
<P>
   Pease added that the political costs would be high if it turned
out the government allowed Montesinos to depart despite Fujimori's
pledges that the ousted spy chief would face a criminal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said the president would benefit by the removal of
a potentially destabilizing element: the spy chief who had wielded
control over key figures in the powerful armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think for Fujimori this was the best bet for solving the
political crisis,'' said Peru expert Julio Carrion at the
University of Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   The military had been ominously silent for days into the crisis,
before coming out in support of Fujimori. ''Apparently the danger
of a military coup has been defused,'' Carrion said.
</P>
<P>
   The Panamanian president's office said Prime Minister Federico
Salas first made a request for asylum for Montesinos late Friday.
Panama, where many have rankled at the country's reputation as a
haven for disgraced Latin American officials, refused that initial
request.
</P>
<P>
   But early Sunday, newspapers reported, Montesinos boarded a
private flight from the military section of Peru's Jorge Chavez
International Airport accompanied by three people, possibly his
security detail.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori made no mention of his spy chief Sunday and instead
praised the intelligence agency and the military -- where Montesinos
is said to have placed many top officers -- for their loyalty during
the fight against leftist insurgents.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by the military high command on a parade ground in Lima,
Fujimori called Peru's ''pacification'' of the guerrillas an
example to the world.
</P>
<P>
   While beset by the rebel threat, he said, Peru ''did not respond
with massive and savage repression, but by way of the intelligence
service as the nucleus of an anti-terrorist strategy.''

Opposition Claiming Yugoslavia Victory
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- With the opposition claiming victory, Slobodan
Milosevic was locked in a bitter election race Sunday that could spell the end
of his 13 years in power, after Yugoslavs turned out in large numbers in chaotic
voting. Hours after polls closed, it appeared the best that Milosevic could hope
for was to head into a runoff Oct. 8 against his strongest challenger, Vojislav
Kostunica. Kostunica's supporters claimed he had won outright and -- after a day
when vote monitors reported widespread irregularities -- accused Milosevic of
trying to manipulate the vote count to force a runoff.

Cheney Calls Oil Tap Political
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's decision to tap the nation's emergency
oil reserves drew fire today from the GOP vice presidential nominee Dick Cheney
as a political move to aid Democrat Al Gore. The action amounted to nothing more
than ''tweaking prices six weeks before the election,'' Cheney said, noting that
the vice president proposed the drawdown just before the Clinton
administration's announcement Friday. But Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said
the president was motivated by the potential heating oil shortages this winter
-- not high prices and the political problem they might cause Gore's White House
bid.

Swiss Reject Anti-Immigration Plan
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- Swiss voters on Sunday rejected a plan to cut the proportion
of foreigners in the country to 18 percent of the population and fix it there by
law. It was the fifth anti-immigration plan to fail since 1970, but the result
showed that concerns persist among a significant minority over what the plan's
backers called ''mass immigration.'' Final results showed 63.7 percent of voters
-- 1.33 million people -- voted against the ''initiative for the regulation of
immigration.'' It was supported by 756,000 votes, or 36.3 percent. None of the
26 cantons, or states, voted in favor of the measure.

on most of the issues, while a time limit will be set for agreement on a very
small part of them,'' his office said in a news release. In recent days, his
Cabinet ministers have hinted they would accept a deal that delayed decisions on

Both Sides Claim Vote in Macedonia
</SUBHEAD>

   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) -- Both the opposition and the ruling coalition were
declaring victory Sunday based on initial results in a second round of municipal
balloting that was marred by scattered violence and irregularities. The ruling
three-party coalition of Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski said its candidates
had won in 70 districts, while the four-party opposition, led by the former
communists, said its candidates were leading in most districts, but did not give
numbers. Before the polls closed in 81 of the country's 123 districts, three
people had been injured in a shootout between government and opposition
supporters in Strumica, about 85 miles southeast of the capital, Skopje.

Tampa Bay. Johnson, a frequent critic of Chrebet during Johnson's days with the
Jets and in his book ''Just Give Me the Damn Ball,'' disrespected Chrebet again
in the week leading to the game matching 3-0 teams. But Johnson caught only one
pass for 1 yard, and for the third time in their four games, the Jets came back
to win after trailing in the fourth quarter.

<HEADLINE> 2 Farmers Die, 7 Hurt in Bolivia  </HEADLINE>
By PETER McFARREN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) -- Farmers protesting destruction of
coca-leaf plants clashed with soldiers trying to end their
demonstrations Sunday, leaving two farmers dead and seven injured
in the latest in a string of violent confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-leaf farmers have set up roadblocks that have interrupted
traffic on the country's main highway for a week, including
sections that go through the country's coca-leaf producing region.
Soldiers have been unable to clear them.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers are demanding greater investment in alternative
crops to compensate for coca losses, creation of a university, and
an end to the building of military barracks in the region.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's incident, which occurred 350 miles east of La Paz on
the road leading to Cochabamba, farmers threw rocks and dynamite
sticks at soldiers who responded with tear gas and rubber bullets.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers are believed to have been killed by a truck driver
who was trying to break through the roadblock, Interior Minister
Guillermo Fortun said.
</P>
<P>
   Coca farmer leader Evo Morales met with government officials
Sunday and agreed to end the roadblocks and protests in the
Chapare, a tropical area in the heart of the country that is close
to having all its coca destroyed by Bolivian soldiers. The Chapare
region is located 480 miles from La Paz.
</P>
<P>
   President Hugo Banzer says Bolivia will no longer be producing
cocaine by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers in the Bolivian highlands, who have also set up
roadblocks, are demanding agrarian reforms, and that consideration
a new water law that was being debated by lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers also are seeking compensation from Enron-owned
Transredes pipeline company for an oil spill on the Desaguadero
River that flows out of Lake Titicaca. Transredes has spent
millions of dollars cleaning the oil spill and provided farmers
with food for their animals.

<HEADLINE> Spy's Panama Flee Riles Inmate's Dad  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- The father of an American woman jailed on
terrorism charges expressed outrage Sunday that deposed spy chief
Vladimiro Montesinos was allowed to flee to Panama while his
daughter continues to languish in a Peruvian prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why is Mr. Montesinos above the law?'' asked Mark Berenson,
after a one-hour visit Sunday with daughter Lori Berenson, 30, at a
Lima women's prison.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1996, the New York native was sentenced to life in
prison by hooded military judges for allegedly helping to plan a
foiled guerrilla attack on Congress. In August she was granted a
new trial in a civilian court and last week testified she was
neither a member nor a collaborator of the pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Berenson questioned how the former head of the National
Intelligence Service, known by its Spanish acronym as SIN, had been
allowed to get away when he had been so publicly exposed on
videotape apparently bribing an opposition congressman.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Montesinos is guilty of sin in the SIN. It was shown on
video,'' he said after Montesinos' flight to Panama. ''I thought
asylum was given to people who are persecuted, not potentially
prosecuted.''
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos fled to Panama around dawn Sunday. Panama has not
said whether it would grant him asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Peru's highest military court overturned Berenson's sentence
Aug. 28, citing new evidence she was not a Tupac Amaru leader.
Under Peru's terrorism legislation, rebel leaders face charges of
treason in secret military courts.
</P>
<P>
   The decision cleared the way for a new trial in an open civilian
court on a lesser terrorism charge, which carries a minimum
sentence of 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson faces an uphill battle to prove her innocence. The
announcement that she was being granted a new trial sparked an
outcry from a wide spectrum of Peruvian society.
</P>
<P>
   For most Peruvians, who were caught in the cross fire between
security forces and leftist guerrillas in the 1980s and early
1990s, her guilt is a foregone conclusion.

<HEADLINE> Vatican Looks To Mend Religion Ties  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY HATTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- Vatican officials sought to mend
relations with other religions at an international ecumenical
meeting here Sunday after straining their ties with claims of the
primacy of the Roman Catholic church.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Edward Cassidy, who heads the Vatican office for
relations with other religions, said a declaration by the Vatican
earlier this month of the Roman Catholic church's primacy over
other Christian denominations had caused ''a little bit of
tension.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican declaration said followers of other religions were
in a ''gravely deficient situation'' regarding salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Some saw the document as contradicting efforts by Pope John Paul
II throughout his papacy to reach out to non-Catholics, and two
rabbis dropped out of a meeting with Christians planned for next
month to protest the Vatican's declaration.
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy said he would seek to reassure the representatives of
other religions at the three-day Lisbon meeting that the Vatican
remained committed to improving relations with non-Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not going back on our commitment to inter-religious
dialogue,'' Cassidy told The Associated Press following a service
at Lisbon's 16th-century Jeronimos church.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course, we are not going to abandon our doctrine ... but we
are still trying to promote dialogue with other religions,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the fact that some Jews are present at the 13th
International Meeting of Peoples and Religions, which is being
attended by 10 religious denominations, was ''a sign that some of
the tensions are over.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Time will pass and we'll get back to what we had achieved,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the Jewish community in Portugal, Joshuah Ruah,
said he wanted the meeting to address directly the Vatican
declaration, though none of the scheduled discussions referred
specifically to the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ''Above all, the meeting must clarify and refute the (Vatican)
declaration,'' Ruah was quoted as saying in Sunday's edition of
daily Diario de Noticias.
</P>
<P>
   The annual meeting is organized by the Community of Sant'Egidio.

Lukman of Nigeria insisted Sunday. Venezuela, which holds the rotating OPEC
presidency, insists the cartel is unified -- and that no production decisions

<HEADLINE> San Diego Chaldeans Welcome Iraqis  </HEADLINE>
By KIMBERLY LAMKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- More than 1,700 Iraqi Christians crowded into
separate church services Sunday to celebrate the release of 46
Iraqi immigrants from U.S. custody and to call for the release of
others being detained in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is difficult to describe it,'' said 28-year-old Mufeed
Yousif, one of 16 Iraqi Christians, or Chaldeans, released by U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service officials Saturday. ''It is
hard to believe I am here. I want to thank the U.S. government and
INS for helping us.''
</P>
<P>
   Yousif is part of a wave of Iraqi Catholics who have fled their
homeland for Mexico in recent months in hopes of seeking political
asylum in the United States. San Diego County is home to some
15,000 Chaldeans, the second largest Iraqi Christian community in
the United States, behind Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The plight of more than 200 Chaldeans drew national attention
last week when Mexican authorities cracked down on a Tijuana hotel
that had been used as a sort of halfway house for those seeking
asylum. The Chaldeans said they feared persecution if forced to
return to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Yousif said he spent 18 days in Tijuana after a five-week
journey from Iraq to Mexico that cost him about $19,000. He said he
walked to Turkey, then flew to Greece and France before flying to
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Yousif said he will stay with friends until he makes enough
money working as an auto mechanic to pay for his own living
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is like President (Kennedy) said -- we must do things for
this country because it is now our country,'' he said. ''We want to
do good things to say thank you for letting us stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   He was one of about 20 Iraqis attending the service at St. Peter
Chaldean Christian Church who had been released by the INS last
week.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the INS processed 64 other Iraqi Christians, bringing
the total since last week to 188, 61 of whom are children.
</P>
<P>
   The INS reported it had paroled 46, releasing them pending a
final determination on their asylum claim by either the INS or a
federal immigration judge. About 40 still remained under guard at
the Tijuana hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The east San Diego County church held two services Sunday, one
in English and one in Aramaic.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the most joyful day of my life,'' said the Rev.
Michael Bazzi, the priest at St. Peter. ''But my joy, our joy, will
not be full until we have all of them here with us.''
</P>
<P>
   He said several church members had been traveling the 35 miles
to the hotel for several weeks. They are asking for the release of
all those in the hotel and jail.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican authorities began preventing Iraqis from leaving the
hotel Wednesday after suspecting them of violating immigration
laws. Nine were arrested Tuesday night, and six remained in jail
Sunday. Some were Americans attempting to help the immigrants gain
asylum.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old son of two of the jailed Americans said his
parents are innocent of all smuggling charges. Anthony Barno said
his parents, Raymond and Kathy Barno, were simply translating for
fellow Chaldeans in the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   More than 500 people signed a petition following Sunday's church
services demanding the Barnos' release.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm trying everything,'' Anthony Barno said. ''They're not
doing well down there. They've been thrown in a room with nothing,
and they're having to sleep on the floor with cockroaches ... all
because they've done nothing wrong.''

Gene McKinney
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Gene McKinney, a leading fund-raiser for
the Black Panther Party in the 1960s, died Sept. 13. He was 58.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death had not been determined.
</P>
<P>
   McKinney met Black Panther Party leader Huey Newton in 1967 at a
fund-raiser for fellow Panther Bobby Seale's legal defense.
</P>
<P>
   After the fund-raiser, McKinney was with Newton when police
stopped them and gunfire broke out. When it was over, Newton lay
wounded and a policeman died from gunshot wounds. McKinney took
Newton to the hospital where the Black Panthers co-founder
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Newton escaped prosecution for the officer's death in part
because McKinney refused to testify about the evening's events at
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Former party chief of staff David Hilliard called McKinney
instrumental in keeping Newton alive the night he was shot.
</P>
<P>
Henry Weinstein
</P>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) -- Henry T. Weinstein, a veteran producer
who tried to help Marilyn Monroe finish her last film, died Sept.
17 after a long illness. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein produced films and worked in television and theater
for more than 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, Weinstein became producer of ''Something's Got to
Give,'' to provide a steadying influence for Monroe, who was
eventually dismissed from the film for absenteeism. It was never
completed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Weinstein produced ''Runaway Train,'' which received
three Academy Award nominations. He also produced a movie of F.
Scott Fitzgerald's ''Tender is the Night'' in 1962, among others.

<HEADLINE> Gabe Jennings Off to Semifinals  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- With the help of former Grateful Dead
drummer Mickey Hart, the beat goes on for Gabe Jennings.
</P>
<P>
   The energy from across the ocean, as well as the drum-beating
vibes from his mother, father and other friends and family
somewhere in the vast Olympic Stadium, propelled Jennings into the
semifinals of the 1,500 meters.
</P>
<P>
   He needed all the help he could get Monday (Sunday night EDT),
because he barely made it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel their energy out there,'' he said. ''I feel like
there's another force with me. Not just my family, my extended
family back home and in the Bay Area. I really feel so lucky to
have this energy behind me.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mickey Hart, drummer from the Grateful Dead, thank you, too,
because he put on a concert last night for me. He had the audience
meditate for me. That really means a lot to me.''
</P>
<P>
   A music major at Stanford and a drummer since he was very young,
Jennings' long black hair has recently been accentuated with a
black goatee that makes his near-constant bright smile even more
noticeable.
</P>
<P>
   He talks and talks and talks, explaining the three segments of
his life -- athletics, music and philosophy. He sometimes sings
while running.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings grew up in the woods of northern California. He lists
his place of birth as Forks of Salmon, Calif., and his home had no
electricity or indoor plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   On his official Olympic biography sheet, he lists his ambition
as ''That I stop dreaming altogether and live.''
</P>
<P>
   He admitted to a bit of dreaming as he prepared for his first
run Monday, and the result was a sixth-place finish in his heat in
3 minutes, 40.6 seconds. The top six in each heat advanced, along
with the next six fastest times. He was the slowest of all the
qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
   As the race approached, he tried to prepare himself through
meditation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was 'ohming.' I was 'Ohhmmmmmmmm,''' he explained. ''I think
I was still meditating when the gun went off.''
</P>
<P>
   He was overwhelmed by the impressive surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I admit I was totally just in awe all around that race,''
Jennings said. ''The main objective was just to stay alive.''
</P>
<P>
   He promised to do better next time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know it's not going to be easy to get to the finals,'' the
21-year-old said. ''But I'll make it.''
</P>
<P>
   The pulsing drumbeat led by his mother has been a constant
backdrop for all of his big races, including victories in the NCAA
championships this year and the U.S. trials. He couldn't hear the
drums in the heats but hopes that changes in Wednesday's
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the drumming will pick up,'' Jennings said. ''I'll be
listening for them.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) - Minnesota's Filip Kuba and Maxim Suchinsky scored
2:07 apart in the third period Sunday night to give the Wild a 4-4
tie with the Chicago Blackhawks in an exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   Kuba cut the Chicago lead to 4-3 on a 5-on-3 power-play goal
with 7:20 remaining in the third. Suchinsky tied it with 5:13 left
on a rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago built a 4-2 advantage midway through the second period
on goals by Tony Amonte and Eric Daze.
</P>
<P>
   The game was tied at 2 after one period as Sergei Krivokrasov
and Darby Hendrickson tallied for Minnesota and Josef Marha and
Valeri Zelepukin scored for the Blackhawks.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago had just four goals in its first five preseason games.

<HEADLINE> GOP senate candidate addresses hate crime bill at town meeting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   POMPANO BEACH, Fla. (AP) - New York Gov. George Pataki joined
GOP Florida U.S. Senate candidate U.S. Rep. Bill McCollum at a town
meeting Sunday night that centered on issues affecting seniors,
such as health care and social security.
</P>
<P>
   Also up for public scrutiny was McCollum's current hate crime
bill.
</P>
<P>
   McCollum, R-Orlando, and Pataki shook hands with more than 50
Pompano Beach residents before fielding questions from the group.
</P>
<P>
   McCollum acknowledged that his crime bill has caused a stir
among politicians and voters alike.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know what's in this bill, I helped write it,'' McCollum
said. ''Hate crime is important to me because it's fundamentally
wrong for someone to commit a crime just because of someone's
race.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill McCollum introduced in Congress in late August would
provide grants of up to $100,000 for the investigation and
prosecution of any hate crimes in all 50 states. It also would
enable federal authorities to prosecute hate crimes under
interstate commerce laws.
</P>
<P>
   Neither chamber has passed the bill, which is still being
considered.
</P>
<P>
   On health care, McCollum said there the country faces ''a real
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In the managed care arena, we've seen things go overboard,''
McCollum said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, in his first Florida forum, acknowledged he had come
south to help MCCollum's bid for the U.S. Senate seat being left
vacant by the retirement this year of the GOP's Connie Mack after
two terms.
</P>
<P>
   ''Being interested in this race,'' said the New York governor, a
fellow Republican: ''is very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki thanked McCollum for his efforts in welfare reform and
his bills aimed reducing crime.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm impressed with his knowledge,'' Pataki said of the 20-year
veteran of the U.S. House. ''Whether you are a Republican or
Democrat, Bill McCollum's issues make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   McCollum's visit with Pataki came just two days after former
President George Bush joined McCollum at a fund-raiser in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The high profile visits are an indication of how important
Mack's open U.S. Senate seat is to Republicans, who are hoping to
prevent the Democrats from regaining a majority in Congress - and
for Democrats, who want to oust the Republican majority assumed in
the legislative branch back in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   McCollum is running against Florida Insurance Commissioner Bill
Nelson for Mack's seat.
</P>
<P>
   At Sunday night's gathering, McCollum said he believes the race
is ''a dead heat'' because he wasn't as well known as Nelson - a
former astronaut - when the race began.
</P>
<P>
   ''As voters get to know me and what I stand for, I think my
message will come across,'' said McCollum, a key player in the
impeachment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was impeached by the U.S. House on perjury charges in
the Monika Lewinsky affair, then acquitted at trial in the U.S
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never had any hatred towards the president,'' McCollum told
questioners Sunday. ''I played a role of a prosecutor.''
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party candidate Joel Deckard and state Rep. Willie Logan,
who is running without a party affiliation, also are in the Florida
U.S. Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Sellers, 85, of Pompano Beach, was impressed with
McCollum.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like his outlook better than I do Nelson's,'' Sellers said.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Vote Concerns Admin.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, which has made
ousting President Slobodan Milosevic a top priority, said Sunday it
was concerned about fraud and other problems in the bitter election
in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were numerous, reliable accounts of irregularities in
today's voting,'' said State Department spokesman Richard Boucher.
''The world is watching these elections and the response of the
authorities in Belgrade very closely.''
</P>
<P>
   The reported irregularities come after several months during
which the Milosevic regime has arrested pro-democracy activists and
prepared for fraud in both the casting and the counting of ballots,
Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has suppressed independent news reports and barred
impartial election observers, both domestic and international, in
violation of basic electoral standards, he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's voting was chaotic after Yugoslavs turned out in large
numbers, estimated at higher than 70 percent. The opposition was
claiming victory in an election that could end Milosevic's 13 years
in power.
</P>
<P>
   But Milosevic showed no signs of conceding defeat and a
spokesman said early Monday he doubted there wouldn't even be a
need for a run-off vote.
</P>
<P>
   During the voting, domestic monitors reported numerous problems,
including ballot boxes stuffed with Milosevic votes, opposition
candidates dropped from voting rolls and voters who were forced to
cast ballots publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a lot of concerns about this election,'' said deputy
White House press secretary Nanda Chitre, traveling with President
Clinton in California.
</P>
<P>
   ''These types of things show a pattern of irregularity that
really brings into question the integrity of the whole process,''
she said.

<HEADLINE> Korean Defense Chiefs Meet  </HEADLINE>
By JAE-SUK YOO
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHEJU, South Korea (AP) -- The defense ministers of South and
North Korea held reconciliation talks Monday for the first time in
five decades of hostility across the world's most heavily fortified
border.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting between South Korean Defense Minister Cho Sung-tae
and Kim Il Chul, minister of the People's Army of North Korea,
marked one of the most significant steps toward establishing
friendly relations on the divided Korean Peninsula since a June
summit of the leaders of both Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in an olive green uniform, Kim smiled and shook hands
with Cho, a former general, at the beginning of their highly
symbolic talks in a five-star hotel. Delegates from both sides
included generals and colonels.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel a great sense of responsibility, given all the
expectations for these talks,'' Kim told Cho.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides planned to hold two rounds of talks in this resort
island of tangerine groves and volcanic cones before the Northern
delegation returns home Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean officials doubt whether sweeping measures that will
ease tension across the peninsula can be achieved in this first
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that the two defense chiefs were discussing
cooperation was seen as a great stride toward peace on the
peninsula. Their border is guarded by nearly 2 million battle-ready
troops on both sides, barbed wire, minefields, and artillery and
missiles that can reach each other's capitals. The two countries'
defense ministers have never met since the division of the
peninsula in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon still regards the North's 1.1-million troop
military -- armed with chemical and biological weapons and
developing long-range missiles -- as one of the greatest security
threats in Northeast Asia. Washington keeps 37,000 U.S. soldiers in
South Korea as a deterrent against the North.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea wants the talks to focus mainly on how Southern and
Northern forces can help reconnect a cross-border railway line and
build a highway linking the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   Reconnecting the rail line, severed shortly before the 1950-53
Korean War, is part of a series of agreements struck between the
two Koreas since the June summit. That project will entail the
removal of up to 100,000 land mines planted in the area of the rail
corridor -- and coordination between the two armies operating in the
potentially volatile Demilitarized Zone, or DMZ, that separates the
two Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   The South Koreans, however, also want to discuss establishment
of a military hot line as well as the notification of large troop
movements and observation of major military exercises.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, delegations from both Koreas met in Seoul to
discuss boosting badly needed investment in the impoverished,
communist North.
</P>
<P>
   Since the presidents of South and North met in June, the two
sides have stopped propaganda broadcasts, allowed one round of
reunions of people separated by the Korean War and taken other
conciliatory steps.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean Peninsula was divided into North Korea and the
pro-Western South at the end of World War II. Their three-year war
ended without a peace treaty in 1953. The two armed forces
occasionally engaged in skirmishes, including a June 1999 naval
clash in which 30 Northern sailors were believed to have died when
one of their torpedo boats was hit and sunk.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia POW To Leave Army  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE (AP) -- The last of three American soldiers captured
during NATO's military campaign against Yugoslavia is leaving the
Army.
</P>
<P>
   Staff Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, who has spent eight years in the
Army, said he wants to remain with the military, possibly as a
recruiter for the National Guard, but he expects to leave the Army
in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone and Spc. Steven
Gonzales were captured by Yugoslavian forces on March 31, 1999,
while on a reconnaissance mission near the Kosovo and Macedonia
border.
</P>
<P>
   They spent 32 days in captivity before the Rev. Jesse Jackson
negotiated their release May 2, seven weeks before the NATO
bombings in Yugoslavia ended.
</P>
<P>
   Stone and Gonzales have both left the Army.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, a 26-year-old Los Angeles native, spoke to the local
chapter of the Association of the United States Army on Saturday
and described the ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''They dragged us through the village, put a pistol at Stone's
head, they were yelling at us,'' said Ramirez, who suffered broken
ribs and other injuries. ''(People in the village) literally came
out of their houses, throwing rocks at us, kicking us.''
</P>
<P>
   The three were interrogated for seven days, with hoods over
their heads and their hands cuffed behind their backs, he said. He
said he was fed once a day, and if he moved his hands or legs he
was hit or kicked.
</P>
<P>
   ''At first I really didn't think it changed me much,'' Ramirez
said, ''but now I think I don't take things for granted.''

<HEADLINE> Williams Edges Seles in Olympics  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The Wimbledon and U.S. Open titles are
nice, but Venus Williams says her next match may be the biggest
yet.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest player in tennis advanced to the Olympic final and
extended her winning streak to 31 matches by beating Monica Seles
6-1, 4-6, 6-3 Monday (Sunday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   Williams said her appreciation of the Olympics has grown since
she arrived in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's probably bigger than a Grand Slam,'' she said. ''This is
possibly a once-in-a-lifetime thing. Everyone is coming out and
playing their best. It seems the ultimate thing is to have a
gold.''
</P>
<P>
   The second-seeded Williams' opponent in the final will be the
winner of the other semifinal between No. 10 Elena Dementieva of
Russia and crowd favorite Jelena Dokic, an unseeded Australian. The
loser will face the third-seeded Seles for the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Williams also remained in contention for the gold in doubles
with her sister Serena.
</P>
<P>
   Unseeded Arnaud Di Pasquale of France became the first men's
semifinalist, beating No. 8 Juan Carlos Ferrero of Spain 6-2, 6-1.
Eight countries -- but not the United States -- were represented in
the men's quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   Williams and Seles played the first match of the day before a
subdued center court crowd. The gray, damp, chilly weather was
reminiscent of Wimbledon, and so was Williams' performance.
</P>
<P>
   She came to the net more than in previous matches at Sydney, and
her power forced Seles to rush shots and often hit off balance.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was a tough match,'' Seles said. ''Venus played really
well, and at the end it got really close, but she played the key
points better.''
</P>
<P>
   The first set in the all-American semifinal took just 18
minutes. Williams led 4-2 in the second set, then began to struggle
with her serve, double-faulting five times in the next two service
games -- including twice on break point -- to lose the set.
</P>
<P>
   Williams regained her poise in the final set. She whacked three
consecutive aces for a 3-1 lead, then erased two break points with
big serves in the eighth game for a 5-3 lead. On the first match
point, she belted a backhand winner down the line to complete the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had some rough patches, and it could have gone either way,''
Williams said. ''Usually when it comes down to it, I'm able to
close it out in important matches.''
</P>
<P>
   Seles was once the hardest hitter in women's tennis, but no
more. She fell to 0-5 against Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Williams advanced to the semifinal Sunday with a 3-6, 6-2, 6-4
victory over Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario. Williams lost to
Sanchez-Vicario at the French Open, then began her winning streak,
which included titles at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open.

<HEADLINE> IOC Official Accuses US of Cover-Up  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The head of the IOC's medical
commission accused U.S. track and field officials of covering up
five positive drug tests before the 1988 Seoul Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Alexandre de Merode said Monday (Sunday night EDT) he
didn't recall the names of the athletes, but that some may have won
medals during the games.
</P>
<P>
   De Merode was speaking amid reports that U.S. shot putter C.J.
Hunter had tested positive for steroids at a meet in Oslo in July.
There has been no official notification of that by either the
international federation or USA Track and Field.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it's happening now, I'm really not surprised,'' de Merode
said. ''It's not the first time such a problem arises in the U.S.
with the national athletic federation.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that in 1988, five U.S. athletes tested positive before
the Seoul Olympics ''and were enlisted at the games. We learned
this from the U.S. team doctor at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ''The American national association didn't tell anyone, not even
the lab,'' de Merode said.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Masback, executive director of USA Track and Field, did
not return several phone message left for him Monday.
</P>
<P>
   De Merode said the IOC has since changed procedures to require
drug-testing laboratories to notify it -- and not just the
international federation -- of all positive samples.
</P>
<P>
   De Merode said he could not remember the names of the '88
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's possible they were winners. I know it wasn't just
anyone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   De Merode said the five athletes had failed out-of-competition
tests and their samples were analyzed by the IOC-accredited
laboratory in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tests were positive and they were not reported,'' de
Merode said. ''The athletes competed in the games. They were
negative at the games.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the reports about Hunter, de Merode said, ''What's
happening today does not surprise me. I don't have the proof that
it's happening today, but I'm not astonished.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he considered the 1988 incident to be a cover-up,
he said, ''Yes, certainly, by the U.S. federation.''

<HEADLINE> Flames 4, Senators 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- Valeri Bure scored on a power play 50
seconds into overtime to cap the Calgary Flames' rally from a
two-goal deficit and beat the Ottawa Senators 4-3 in an exhibition
game Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   With Colin Forbes in the penalty box for cross-checking in the
final minute of the third period, Calgary controlled the puck for
the entire 4-on-3 overtime advantage with Bure eventually slapping
a shot over the shoulder of goaltender Jani Hurme.
</P>
<P>
   Also scoring for Calgary (4-1-0) was Miika Elomo, Tommy Albelin
and Niklas Andersson.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie left-winger Martin Havlat continued his strong preseason
for Ottawa, leading the Senators with a goal and an assist. Magnus
Arvedson and Alexei Yashin also scored for Ottawa (1-1-2 and one
overtime loss).
</P>
<P>
   Playing in his third exhibition game after sitting out all of
last season in a contract dispute, Yashin was booed when he first
took the ice in the game's opening minute and each time he touched
the puck the remainder of the game.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Claiming Yugoslavia Vote  </HEADLINE>
By DUSAN STOJANOVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- After an election Sunday marked by a
large turnout and allegations of fraud, Yugoslavia's once
struggling opposition claimed victory and urged Slobodan Milosevic
to peacefully quit power after 13 years of hardline rule.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, however, showed no signs of conceding defeat. His
spokesman, Nikola Sainovic, told reporters early Monday he doubted
there would even be a need for a run-off vote -- required if no
candidate gets more than 50 percent -- because ''our candidate is
leading.''
</P>
<P>
   The state election commission closed up for the night without
announcing any official returns. Voting -- in which the turnout was
estimated at higher than 70 percent -- was plagued Sunday by reports
of blatant irregularities by Milosevic backers, including ballot
box stuffing, the few domestic monitors watching the polls said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, two rival opposition parties said Milosevic was trailing
his strongest challenger, Vojislav Kostunica, and that the best the
Yugoslav president could hope for was to head into a runoff Oct. 8.
They based the claims on counts by their own vote monitors.
</P>
<P>
   ''According to our count, the first-round victory is certain.
Dawn is coming to Serbia. I'm excited,'' Kostunica said early
Monday. ''I'm happy for the people and the country because it's
almost the last moment to take the destiny in our hands. There is
much work ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no doubt that we overwhelmingly won on all levels,''
said opposition campaign manager Zoran Djindjic. ''Milosevic has to
seriously understand the judgment of history, and he shouldn't
gamble any longer. He has to recognize the defeat. It seems, this
is the end of his career.''
</P>
<P>
   Confident of victory by an opposition that seemed hopelessly
fragmented only months ago, huge crowds streamed into the streets
of downtown Belgrade late Sunday to await official results.
Helmeted riot police carrying shields and armed with tear gas
launchers cordoned off the group but later withdrew after a concert
by Milosevic's supporters ended.
</P>
<P>
   Similar gatherings were reported in Nis, Novi Sad, Cacak and
several other towns in Yugoslavia's main republic Serbia. There
were no reports of clashes, and early Monday the crowds in Belgrade
were returning home.
</P>
<P>
   With no offical word on results, Western governments held late
night consultations to determine how to respond if Milosevic rigs
the count.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the State Department warned that ''the world is
watching these elections and the response of the authorities in
Belgrade very closely.''
</P>
<P>
   In the voting, ''large numbers of the population ... expressed
their wishes in an election where the choice was clear,'' spokesman
Richard Boucher said. ''We congratulate the people of Yugoslavia on
their commitment to democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sainovic, who like Milosevic is under international indictment
for war crimes, disputed the opposition claims of victory. He
claimed that with 20 percent of the votes counted, Milosevic was
leading by 44 percent while Kostunica had 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures were different from those posted on the party's
own web site, which showed Kostunica leading with 44 percent to 41
percent for Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Cedomir Jovanovic, spokesman of Kostunica's Democratic
Opposition of Serbia, said that based on returns from 45 percent of
10,000 polling stations, Kostunica was leading with 57 percent to
33 percent for Milosevic. Three other candidates are in the race.
</P>
<P>
   The ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party, Milosevic's partner
in Serbia's government, reported Kostunica leading Milosevic by
53.5 percent to 37.9 percent with about 20 percent of the votes
counted. The party admitted its own candidate was defeated.
</P>
<P>
   The United States -- which has invested millions of dollars in an
attempt to organize the traditionally fractured Serbian opposition
-- has made ousting Milosevic a major goal, believing there can be
no stability in the Balkans so long as he remains in power.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes were especially high in the voting, which also
included selection of a new parliament and municipal governments.
</P>
<P>
   If Milosevic loses, he risks extradition to the U.N. war crimes
tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, which indicted him last year
for atrocities committed by his troops in Kosovo. He may also risk
massive revenge by Yugoslavs tired of being an impoverished pariah
country after a decade of his rule.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union has promised massive aid to Yugoslavia if
Milosevic loses. Montenegro, the smaller republic that along with
Serbia forms present-day Yugoslavia, said it would hold an
independence referendum if Milosevic wins.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica had been leading in opinion polls despite a campaign
marred by a crackdown against opposition supporters, one-sided
coverage by the staunchly pro-Milosevic media and the lack of
broad-based foreign monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Free Elections and Democracy, a private group
including human rights workers, lawyers and other volunteers,
reported a turnout of 74.6 percent in Yugoslavia's main republic
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   In the smaller republic of Montenegro -- where the pro-Western
government boycotted the vote -- the turnout was only about 24
percent, the opposition said.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic made no statement about the seemingly unfavorable
returns. Earlier Sunday, he brushed aside accusations that he would
rig the vote to stay in power, predicting prosperity after he wins
and his troubled country is ''cleared up'' politically.
</P>
<P>
   The president's statement, made after he cast his ballot in the
Dedinje district where he lives, may indicate he plans to crack
down hard on political opponents -- whom he has dubbed NATO lackeys
and traitors -- if he's declared the winner.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Free Elections and Democracy reported major
voting irregularities. They included opposition representatives
being kicked out of polling stations or not allowed to inspect
voters' lists, voting boxes and ballots.
</P>
<P>
   At many voting places, police were present in front of polling
stations, and there was public -- instead of secret -- voting in
southern regions of Serbia, according to the center, a
nongovernmental organization which included human rights activists,
lawyers and other pro-democracy volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   In the eastern town of Negotin, opposition representatives were
banned from a polling station but managed to get in by force, only
to find that the ballot boxes had been stuffed in advance with
ballots for Milosevic, the Belgrade-based group said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is an absolute mess in Serbia today,'' said Marko
Blagojevic from independent monitoring group. ''I don't think
elections like this were ever held anywhere, ever since the Stone
Age.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's electoral commission said the vote passed
without irregularities, ''despite Western propaganda.''
</P>
<P>
   Sainovic claimed Milosevic won ''overwhelmingly'' in Kosovo.
However, the chief U.N. administrator in the province, Bernard
Kouchner, said the ''so-called elections did not meet any
international and European standards in terms of democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the examples cited by the monitoring group could not be
confirmed. However, in Kosovo, Western reporters saw cases where
polling stations were never opened, where prominent opposition
members were told their names were not on registration rolls or
where voters had no privacy to mark their ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Others were turned away because their names did not appear on
registration lists. Officials claimed that was a result of the
turmoil that swept Kosovo during last year's conflict, which ended
with the arrival of NATO-led peacekeepers.

<HEADLINE> Robb, Allen Debate Va. Education  </HEADLINE>
By BOB LEWIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Sen. Chuck Robb aggressively challenged
former Gov. George Allen on education and abortion Sunday night in
the first televised debate of their U.S. Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic incumbent went after Allen on the Republican
challenger's $2,000-per-family education expenses tax credit
proposal and on whether Allen would support abortion restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Allen countered by assailing Robb's record of voting for tax
increases and his introduction of a 50-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax
increase seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Robb criticized Allen's education proposal, saying $300 billion
of its $345 billion cost would go to tax cuts and leave schools
with substantial unmet needs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let me suggest an alternative,'' Robb said. ''We could buy a
laptop computer for every public high school student in America for
the next 10 years, we could renovate 60,000 schools that need
renovating, we could hire 76,000 school safety officers for every
school in America ... and we would still have $15 billion left to
pay down the debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen has proposed giving parents a $1,000 per-child credit,
with a $2,000 family limit, that could be used to buy educational
aids such as computers, software, books or tutoring. The remaining
money would be used to hire new teachers, fund early reading
programs and construct new schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes, we need to invest more in schools,'' Allen said. ''But
why not allow parents to make those decisions?''
</P>
<P>
   Robb also challenged Allen on abortion, asking him pointedly to
say whether he would support reversing the Supreme Court's Roe v.
Wade decision that gave women the legal right to abortions. Allen
responded with a litany of abortion legislation he had supported as
governor, including a law that requires parental notification when
girls under 18 seek abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Allen hit Robb hardest on his tax record, particularly his
introduction of a gasoline tax bill in 1993 and votes he has cast
against ending the so-called marriage penalty. He cited a published
interview in which Robb said earlier this year he thought the
gasoline tax was good policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The circumstances have changes since then,'' Robb said. ''Yes,
it's good public policy, it's not good politics.''
</P>
<P>
   On the marriage tax issue, Robb said Allen was distorting his
votes by failing to note Robb had voted seven times this year for
bills he said would provide more relief than versions Allen backed.
</P>
<P>
   Allen also tried to link Robb closely to President Clinton -- who
has been unpopular in Virginia -- accusing him of voting for the
president 87 percent of the time and relying on him for
fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by up to 10 percentage points in recent published
polls, Robb sought to draw sharp lines between himself and Allen.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a very aggressive debate, and the winners here are
the people who watched,'' said Robert Holsworth, a political
scientist at VCU and one of the debate questioners.
</P>
<P>
   Robb, 61, at times appeared to lecture Allen, 48. Both
candidates are former governors: Robb served from 1982 to 1986, and
Allen served 1993 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is trying to show that Allen does not have the proper
seasoning to work in the U.S. Senate,'' Holsworth said.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Isaac Still in Atlantic  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Hurricane Isaac remained deep in the Atlantic Ocean
on Sunday with 115 mph winds and posed no immediate threat to land,
forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
   Isaac had strengthened since becoming a named storm on Thursday.
Its maximum sustained winds increased from 39 mph to 120 mph, then
dropped back to 115 mph on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Satellite photographs Sunday showed its once well-defined eye
had become slightly less organized, said Richard Pasch, a hurricane
specialist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, Isaac was 1,470 miles east of the Leeward Islands,
at the eastern edge of the Caribbean, and moving to the
west-northwest at about 12 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not saying it will never be a threat to land, but it
will be at least several days before that's possible,'' Pasch said.
