<HEADLINE> Chinese Foreign Trade Minister Meets French Trade Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- China will unswervingly
continue to carry out its policy of reform and opening-up, Chinese
Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi said during a meeting here this
afternoon with Yves Galland, minister-delegate to France's
Ministry of Economics and Finance.
</P>
<P>
Galland, in charge of finance and foreign trade, came to China
to prepare for the visit by French President Jacques Chirac to
China this May.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the French Government, Galland expressed
condolences over the death of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Wu, minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, said,
"The death of Deng is a great loss to the cause of reform and
opening-up in China. The Chinese people, however, will turn grief
into strength and continue to fulfill the cause initiated by
Comrade Deng, under the strong leadership of the third generation
of the collective leadership of the Chinese Communist Party with
Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core."
</P>
<P>
She said China attaches great importance to developing its
economic and trade relations with France, and looks forward to
smooth bilateral cooperation in the fields of aviation and power.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from China's General Administration of Customs show
that the volume of Sino-French trade reached 4.15 billion US
dollars-worth last year, with China's exports standing at 1.907
billion US dollars-worth and imports at 2.24 billion US
dollars-worth. Galland, however, said that his country has a trade
deficit.
</P>
<P>
It is not surprising for one country to have deficits vis-a-vis
some countries while having surpluses vis-a-vis others, Wu noted.
</P>
<P>
Quarrels won't help resolve any problems, Wu pointed out,
adding that China adheres to the policy of seeking balance through
development and insists on settlement of problems through equal
and friendly negotiations.
</P>
<P>
She said China attaches great importance to Chirac's visit and
Chinese businessmen are willing to work with their French
counterparts to create an ideal atmosphere for the visit.
</P>
<P>
Galland said France was one of the first countries to recognize
the People's Republic of China and highly values its ties with
China, especially in the economic and trade sphere.
</P>
<P>
Both sides exchanged views on the 12th session of the
Sino-French economic and trade joint committee and the issue of
anti-dumping.
</P>
<P>
Wu said China highly values its economic and trade ties with
the European Union (EU), its third-biggest trading partner. She
added that China resolutely opposes the EU's discriminative
limitations on some Chinese products and hopes that France will do
something for the settlement of the problem.

<HEADLINE> China Opens First Domestic Airmail Route </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, February 27 (Xinhua) -- China's first domestic airmail
route has been opened for service between this major industrial
city in North China and Northeast China's Xiamen City.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese-made Yun-8 aircraft carrying two tons of postal
matter took off from Tianjin's Binhai International Airport at
6:30 am today, on the route's maiden flight via Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The route was opened by the China Airmail Co. Ltd, which was
established late last year with approval from the State Council
and the Civil Aviation Administration of China.
</P>
<P>
The company, based at the Binhai airport, plans to open a
second route -- between Tianjin and South China's Guangzhou City,
via central China's Wuhan City -- this April.
</P>
<P>
It is said that China's postal service network, dominated by
railway transportation, had fallen behind the demand for speedy
delivery. More than 76 percent of China's domestic mail is still
transported by train.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Proposes Talks With India on Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif today proposed Foreign Secretary level talks with
India on the issue of Kashmir before the end of March as a prelude
to the Prime Ministerial level talks.
</P>
<P>
The proposed talks are to "prepare ground for meaningful
discussion at Prime Ministerial level talks as early as possible,"
Sharif said in reply to a letter from Indian Prime Minister Deve
Gowda.
</P>
<P>
He hoped Gowda would agree with him that "without some progress
on the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir it will be difficult to
initiate cooperation in economic and cultural fields."
</P>
<P>
"As we approach the 50th anniversary of our independence, there
is a historic opportunity for the political leadership of both the
countries to deal with all the outstanding disputes which bedevil
our relations," Sharif said.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Sees HK as Chance for Consolidating No. 1 Position </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 27 (Xinhua) -- As world number one tennis
player, Pete Sampras sees the coming Salem Open '97 in Hong Kong
as much more than just another stop of the year's ATP Tour.
</P>
<P>
A win at the tournament, which is the only ATP Tour World
Series event in Hong Kong to award world-ranking points, will keep
the 25-year-old right-hander at the top of the ATP Tour rankings
and push him to overtake compatriots John McEnroe and Jimmy
Connors in the record books.
</P>
<P>
But before reaching that height, Sampras has to overcome his
arch rival and 25-year-old compatriot Michael Chang, who has also
something to prove at this year's tournament, slated for April
5-13. The third-ranked Chang is desperate to win again in Asia,
following a disappointing year in the region in 1996. He failed
to pick up an Asian title for the first time since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Sampras has finished the last four years at the top, joining
the ranks of McEnroe and Connors; and to finish 1997 in the top
spot will underline his status as one of the greatest players of
the Open era to finish at the top of the ATP Tour rankings for
five consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
Along with Sampras and Chang, other players expected to play
key roles in the 328,000 U.S. dollars event include Switzerland's
big-serving former Olympic champion Marc Rosset, who is now ranked
16th in the world, and three Australians -- Todd Woodbridge,
ranked 26th, his doubles partner and 50th-ranked Mark Woodforde
and Patrick Rafter, who will be making his third appearance in
four years at Salem Open, having reached the final in 1994.
</P>
<P>
A total of 32 players are entered in the main draw for the
singles and the event also includes a 16-pair doubles
competition.

<HEADLINE> Russia Seeks Best Compromise of NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian leaders have
quietly taken a more pragmatic approach to the planned eastward
expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a U.S.
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
"In recent months, Russia has taken a two-tiered approach to
NATO's planned enlargement to include Poland, Hungary and the
Czech Republic by 1999," The Washington Post reported.
</P>
<P>
One level was a vigorous public campaign by all the Russians
against the expansion. The second track was to be ready to
negotiate a compromise, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
"Now Russia seems to be putting fresh emphasis on the second
approach," the report said, quoting a Western diplomat as saying,
"Their tact has been to protest loudly and then crawl back."
</P>
<P>
"This is a negotiating game, and the Russians will try and get
as much as they can," the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
NATO planned to list the first group of countries that will be
allowed to join the alliance at its special summit in Madrid in
July.
</P>
<P>
Russia, which says that the alliance's enlargement will divide
Europe and create a new Cold War, strongly opposes NATO's plan.
</P>
<P>
Shuttle diplomacy by both sides has undergone between capitals
of NATO members and Moscow. However, no breakthrough has been
reached in the row.

<HEADLINE> Crackdown On Crimes Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The "Strike Hard" campaign
launched by the Ministry of Public Security last winter against
crimes has been crowned with great success, with the smashing of
more than 38,000 criminal gangs.
</P>
<P>
In Last December and January, the public security bureaus at
various levels cracked more than 30,000 criminal cases and closed
down more than 19,000 song and dance halls and hair-dressing
saloons involving illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
Over 18,000 runaway criminals were re-captured, and more than
10,000 criminals turned themselves in or were seized and handed
over by ordinary citizens to the public security authorities.
</P>
<P>
During the campaign some big criminal cases were cracked, such
as a murder and bank robbery case in Wuhan, capital of central
China's Hubei Province, a series of rape cases in Shaanxi
Province, a kidnapping case in north China's Hebei Province, a gun
theft case in northeast China's Liaoning Province and eight cases
of drug trafficking in southwest China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
A circular has been issued by the Ministry of Public Security,
calling for an intensification of the "Strike Hard" campaign to
lay a solid foundation for the maintenance of social stability.

<HEADLINE> Manila, Rebels Agree to Form Panel to Monitor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Peace negotiators from the
Philippine government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
rebels today reached an agreement to form an independent panel to
monitor their ceasefire in clashed areas in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached after the two sides had three days of
preliminary talks in Cotabato, Maguindanao province, the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
It was their second round of low-level talks, during which the
two parties also agreed to have another round of talks in a bid to
seek a full and permanent ceasefire in the MILF-controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
The official Philippine Television (PTV) reported that the
initial members of the independent panel will come from the media,
an education peace center, a lawyers league and some religious
groups.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is a breakaway faction of the mainstream Moro National
Liberation Front which signed a peace agreement with the
government last year, ending a 24-year-old civil war in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that sporadic clashes between government troops
and MILF rebels occurred in Buldon, Maguindanao, last month,
killing at least 40 people. Later on, the two sides reached a
temporary ceasefire and decided to hold preliminary peace talks.

<HEADLINE> EU Calls for Direct Negotiations in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU)
Commissioner for External Relations Hans van den Broek today
called on the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides to embark on
comprehensive talks to end the division of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The EU commissioner, who arrived here Wednesday night, made
the remarks today after meeting with Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides.
</P>
<P>
"If there is and remains separation, the country will be in
constant conflict and there will be others outside the country
benefiting from the hostile situation," Van den Broek warned.
</P>
<P>
Expressing support for "each and every effort to get an
opening of negotiations," the commissioner said "I reconfirm the
EU commitment toward the president to start accession
negotiations next year and underline how important it is to see
some perspective and some movement by that time on the political
side."
</P>
<P>
This, he said, would make accession negotiations much
easier and could conclude them probably much sooner.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Turkish Cypriot participation in the process
of accession, the commissioner said most EU member states have
expressed a wish to see the Turkish Cypriots involved in the
accession talks.
</P>
<P>
He invited the Turkish Cypriots to show their own initiatives
to facilitate a solution to the Cyprus problem and assist their
participation in the accession process.
</P>
<P>
Van den Broek said he will explain to the Turkish Cypriots
that they can benefit from EU funds and the single European
market as well as increased tourism.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a structured dialogue between the EU and Cyprus
was postponed in Brussels following disagreement among EU member
states over Turkish Cypriot participation.
</P>
<P>
Britain, France and Germany made a proposal insisting the
inclusion of phrases in the EU document calling for the
participation of all Cypriots in the accession process.
</P>
<P>
But Greece rejected the document and warned that the EU would
pay a price for its demands.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, which has remained divided since 1974, applied for
full EU membership in 1990.

<HEADLINE> 3Com Plans to Acquire US Robotics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The 3Com Corporation, a major
network company of the U.S., will acquire the U.S. Robotics
Corporation in a 6.6 billion U.S. dollar stock swap that will
create the second-largest computer networking company.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported today that acquisition would
strengthen 3Com's power against competitors, particularly Cisco
Systems Inc., the leader in computer networking, by broadening its
product line.
</P>
<P>
While 3Com, based in Santa Clara, California, is a market
leader in local area network equipment, best known for its
Ethernet adaptor cards, which connect personal computers to local
area networks, it has lagged behind in wide area network devices,
which connect over much longer distances. U.S. Robotics, however,
is a major maker of remote access servers, which handle incoming
calls at services like America Online.
</P>
<P>
Share prices of both companies went up Wednesday on the Nasdaq
market, with U.S. Robotics surging 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the deal, each share of U.S. Robotics' stock
will be exchanged for 1.75 shares of 3Com stock, which is valued
according to the closing prices Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the deal was essentially a merger of equals. But
they added the deal made good strategic sense for both companies.
Ever since Cisco went from being a router company to a company
that offered a full line of networking devices, mostly by
acquiring a string of companies, competitors in the field have
struggled to keep up.
</P>
<P>
The combined company would have 5 billion U.S. dollars in
revenues and more than 12,000 employees. U.S. Robotics' Chicago
headquarters will become a division of 3Com.
</P>
<P>
The deal will put additional pressure on competitors. The
networking market is already brutally competitive, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> US Durable Goods Orders Increase in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Orders to U.S. factories
for durable goods surged by 3.6 percent in January, the largest
increase since last September, the U.S. Commerce Department
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that orders for durable goods totaled a
seasonally adjusted 174.8 billion dollars, up from 168.8 billion
in December.
</P>
<P>
The report also revised December's orders to a 1.8 percent drop
from the earlier estimated decline of 1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
It showed that each of the major categories shared the gain in
January, including a double-digit increase in electronic and other
electrical equipment.
</P>
<P>
Transportation orders rose by 1.2 percent in January, erasing a
0.9 percent loss a month earlier. Increases in motor vehicles and
airplanes more than offset decreases in shipbuilding, tanks and
railroad equipment.
</P>
<P>
Excluding transportation, orders were up by 4.4 percent, the
first increase in four months.
</P>
<P>
Unfilled orders, which were unchanged in December, increased by
0.8 percent, the eighth increase in the last nine months. A
growing backlog suggests businesses could find it necessary to
increase production facilities and manpower to meet demand.
</P>
<P>
Shipments, a measure of current activity, rose by 1.2 percent
following the 0.9 percent decline in December.
</P>
<P>
Orders for durable goods are a key gauge of the U.S.
manufacturing sector. Continued growth could lead to increased
production and more jobs.

ISLAMABAD, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif today called for changes in the procedure and
techniques of checking international passengers by immigration and
Customs staff.
</P>
<P>
He said the stamps used for passports by the Immigration staff
at the time of departure and arrival of international passengers
are not usually legible.
</P>
<P>
This makes it difficult to fix responsibility on the concerned
immigration staff, who might work in connivance with the narcotics
smugglers, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also advised the immigration staff to use separate color
stamps at the points of arrival and departure as being done at
other major airports in the world.
</P>
<P>
Sharif asked the Interior Ministry to cut down the number of
immigration and customs staff at international airports so as to
minimize the harassment of international passengers at the hands
of immigration and customs staff.

<HEADLINE> France Withdraws Military Advisors From Central Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 27 (Xinhua) -- France today announced the
withdrawal of its advisors for the Central African presidential
security service, following two days of anti-French riots in the
Central African capital of Bangui by militant supporters of
President Ange-Felix Patasse.
</P>
<P>
Pierre Servent, an advisor to French Defense Minister Charles
Millon, said that the French advisors for the presidential
security service, estimated at 23 by the local daily Liberation,
were withdrawn because the situation in Central Africa had been
"improved."
</P>
<P>
"The presidential security service should evolve in the medium
term toward a republican guard which will better reflect the
appeal for national union launched by President Patasse
recently," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that all the French soldiers stationed in
Bangui have returned to their barracks, except those in charge of
protecting the French embassy and the residence of the French
ambassador.
</P>
<P>
France now maintains 1,800 soldiers in Central Africa,
including 1,200 in Bangui.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that over the past two
days, French civilians and their cars were attacked with stones in
Bangui, while anti-French pamphlets were distributed by the
militants of the presidential party, the Movement of Liberation of
the Central-African People (MLPC).
</P>
<P>
The secretary general of the MLPC, Joseph Vermond Tchendo,
appealed on television Wednesday night for calm, and asked the
MLPC militants to "cease throwing stones on foreigners, no matter
whether they are black or white."
</P>
<P>
Most of the incidents took place on a highway between the
Bangui airport, near which there is an air base used by the French
troops, and the headquarters of the MLPC. The road is frequented by
French military men and civilians, said AFP.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear why the riots broke out, in which no one was
seriously injured.

HARARE, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Efforts to promote economic
integration should be speeded-up if countries in the region are
to compete in the global economy, a COMESA official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing delegates at a two-day meeting on international
trade finance, Executive Secretary of the Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) bankers association Davison
Marape said the world was changing, with economic blocs being

"Consolidation of our regional cooperation and integration
would enable us to develop our industries, attract foreign
investment and create employment for our ever-increasing
populations," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the meeting, which ends on Friday, aimed at providing
information to participants about trade financing techniques,
banking guarantees and inherent risks in these operations.
</P>
<P>
Marape said commercial banks required a strong forum at
national and regional levels to enable them to extend their
activities and participate in the economic development of the
sub-region.

<HEADLINE> Nepali PM Hails Relations With India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Sher Bahadur
Deuba today hailed the recent developments of Nepal-India
relations, adding that the two neighbors will work as equal
partners in trade and development of water resources.
</P>
<P>
Opening a two-day seminar here, Deuba said the positive
developments in bilateral relations between Nepal and India in the
past year proved that the two countries are ready to explore
strengths for mutual socio-economic benefits.
</P>
<P>
An electric power trade agreement and a landmark treaty on
integrated development of the Mahakali river, Nepal's western
boundary with India, have heralded a new era of bilateral
cooperation in water resources development, the Nepali prime
minister said.
</P>
<P>
The two documents were signed last February during Deuba's
official visit to India.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Nepal-India Trade and Transit Treaty signed
last December in Kathmandu, Deuba said a new, significant
dimension has been added to the economic relations between the two
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
He said that the new trade treaty, in which India pledges to
lift requirements on material and labor contents for Nepali
exports, would contribute to increasing Nepal's export to India
and help offset the country's current trade imbalance.
</P>
<P>
India is Nepal's biggest trading partner, accounting for over
one-third of the country's total foreign trade with an
overwhelming surplus.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade was 628 million US dollars last year with an
imbalance of 386 million dollars in India's favor.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, organized by a local institute, is being attended
by government officials, former ministers, industrialists and
economists from the two countries and representatives of
international donor agencies.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Economy in Right Track in 1996: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Most recent figures show that
the Dutch economy is heading in the right direction, with the
gross domestic product in the Netherlands growing last year by 2.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch economy is now more broadly based, with all
categories of expenditure contributing to the growth in GDP in the
second half of last year, Statistics Netherlands reported today in
its Economic Outlook.
</P>
<P>
The estimates for the growth in the volume of industrial
production in 1996 point to stable growth. Though the growth of
the construction industry is lagging behind that in the
manufacturing industry, the figure last year was the highest for
eight years.
</P>
<P>
Household consumer spending rose sharply in 1996 to record the
highest growth rate since 1991. The volume of consumer credit in
1996 totaled over 16 billion guilders (10.7 billion U.S. dollars),
an increase of 14.4 percent on 1995 -- the largest in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Private individuals were highly active in borrowing, saving and
investing in 1996 and share prices set one record after another.
The average savings balances held by private individuals with
savings institutions rose by 7 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of 1996, household consumption was the main
motive force for GDP growth. In the second half of the year, the
other expenditure categories -- international trade and investment
-- also contributed positively to growth.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the volume of industrial production in
1996 was 2.0 percent up on the year before, when industrial
production rose by 2.3 percent. By contrast, production falls were
recorded in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The largest rise in output occurred last year in the textiles,
clothing and leather industry and the metal industry. A fall in
added value was recorded in 1996 in the chemical industry and the
rubber and plastics industry.

<HEADLINE> McDonald's Corporation to Stem Slide in US Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW York, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The McDdonald's Corporation,
the largest fast-food company in the United States, is trying to
stem slide in the domestic market by cutting prices, according to
a report of the New York Times today.
</P>
<P>
The company, frustrated by steady market share gains by its
leading rivals in the country, plans to slash prices on selected
items on a rotating basis. Initially, the Big Mac burger that now
sells for about two U.S. dollars would be cut to about 55 cents
when purchased along with fries and a drink.
</P>
<P>
For the last six quarters, sales at McDonald's open a year or
more have fallen though its business outside the United States has
been booming.
</P>
<P>
The company's domestic sales jumped from 10.6 billion U.S.
dollars in 1987 to nearly 16.4 billion U.S. dollars last year, but
its overall fast-food market share fell from 17.8 percent to 16.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
The competition comes from Burger King and several new quick
service players, including the rapidly expanding bagel chains.
</P>
<P>
Analysts and experts said that McDonald's action raised the
possibility of a fast-food price war. And investors on Wall Street
generally feared that a wave of price cutting would lead to lower
profits.

PARIS, February 27 (Xinhua) -- A big fire engulfed a hotel and
gutted a cinema in the center of the Algerian capital of Algiers
at 15:45 local time (1445 GMT) today, according to reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that the fire was caused by an explosion in the

<HEADLINE> Schmidt Writes Article in Memory of Deng Xiaoping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Former German Chancellor Helmut
Schmidt today published a long article in a German weekly in
memory of the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, reviewing his
great contributions to China's modernization.
</P>
<P>
In the article titled "The Renovator of China" carried by the
weekly "Die Zeit", Schmidt said that he had met Deng four times
within 15 years from 1975, when he first visited Beijing as German
Chancellor.
</P>
<P>
At that time, he said, no one could imagine the "great economic
development" achieved by China since 1978 under the leadership of
Deng.
</P>
<P>
"When I met Deng for a second time in 1984, China's success had
already become even more evident," he said, adding that when
people look back in the next century, they will come to the
conclusion that "it is Deng who has helped China, a huge country,
achieve the fundamental success in its modernization."
</P>
<P>
In the article, Schmidt also spoke highly of Deng's
contributions in the field of diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to Deng Xiaoping, China has actually become --
economically, geostrategically and militarily -- a world power
which is no longer isolated from the rest of the world," Schmidt
said.
</P>
<P>
"China would play a much bigger role in world politics in the
21st century than in the 19th or 20th centuries," he added.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the article, Schmidt said that the United States
should see China as an "equal partner" and give up all the attempt
to impose its own ideology on it.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Future of Bangladesh's Leather Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's leather industry,
the country's fifth biggest foreign exchange earner, is in the
doldrums due to a lack of funds and technical know-how, local
producers and exporters warn.
</P>
<P>
Export earnings from the leather sector slumped to 92.29
million U.S. dollars during July-December of the current fiscal
year, a 14 percent drop compared with the previous corresponding
period.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, exports of finished leather
are estimated to be about 17.28 million square feet annually,
accounting for only 10-11 percent of the total leather processed
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh may lose an additional 75 million U.S. dollars
annually due to the slow conversion into finished leather from
crust leather, leather experts estimated.
</P>
<P>
The major constraints in expansion of finished leather
production are lack of working capital, requisite technology and
marketing experience, said the experts.
</P>
<P>
The nature of the industry requires the holding of large
inventories of raw hides and imported chemicals due to seasonal
variation in supply, which means large working capital.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, the bank support to our industry is far from
satisfactory," complained Garib Newaz, a leading leather producer,
adding that the crisis of working capital precludes entrepreneurs
from long term investment to increase the quality of leather.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Leaders of Bangladesh Finished Leather Exporter's
Association and Leather Goods Manufacturers Association have
recently submitted a joint memorandum to the Industries and
Commerce Minister Toafel Ahmed demanding fresh credit for the
capital-starved industry.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, most of the finished leather exporters lack
marketing experience, which often results in a low level of
capacity utilization.
</P>
<P>
There is also an acute shortage of qualified tanners, resulting
in low-quality output and a high percentage of damaged raw
material.
</P>
<P>
As slaughtering is done by unskilled butchers in most
tanneries, the hides and skin are damaged with flay cuts, scratch
marks and loss of area, which downgrades the quality.
</P>
<P>
Although modern machinery is equipped to a good number of
tanneries, the proper use of them cannot be ensured due to lack of
technical and skilled manpower.
</P>
<P>
"As there is little chance of increased supply of leather, more
value addition should be emphasized," said local exporters, noting
that only 200 million square feet of crust and finished leather is
produced annually in 65 tanneries throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Expressing optimism, they said export earnings could reach at
least 650 million U.S. dollars by transporting leather into
leather goods.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goals, more training centers and institutions
should be installed to produce skilled professionals and ensure
quality production, they added.

<HEADLINE> Investment From Developing Asia on Rise in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct investment (FDI)
in Europe by Asian developing economies reached an average 860
million US dollars during 1992-94 with 40 percent of the European
Union's stock going to Britain, according to an UN's report
released here today.
</P>
<P>
The investment total compared with just 100 million US dollars
in 1989-91, said the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) in the report entitled "Sharing Asia's
Dynamism: Asian Direct Investment in the European Union."
</P>
<P>
Many firms of the Asian newly industrializing economies (NIEs)
increasingly see need for a direct presence in the EU in order to
serve this large and rich market, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Others are seeking access to advanced technology and skills,
research and development programs, it added.
</P>
<P>
While North America remains Asian NIEs' main investment
location beyond Asia, their activities in the EU have gathered
momentum, both in manufacturing and services.
</P>
<P>
Investment projects in the two sectors were located in Britain
ahead of any other country and Britain also hosted Asian
investment in all major services industries.
</P>
<P>
Direct investment in electronics accounted for three-quarters
of all manufacturing projects from Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore and
Taiwan, with Britain again claiming the largest share.
</P>
<P>
Nearly three-quarters of Korean investment alone in Europe --
worth a total of 1 billion US dollars in 1995 -- was in electrical
and electronic products.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong was said to be the most important investor among the
Asian developing economies in the EU with 1.3 billion US dollars
in FDI stock in 1994.
</P>
<P>
However, 30 percent of its FDI in the EU actually originated
from other economies and most Hong Kong FDI in the EU was in
wholesale and retail trade.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan ranks second among Asian developing economies in terms
of FDI inflows into the European Union. As in the case of other
Asian newly industrializing economies, investors are attracted
mainly by Britain," the report said.
</P>
<P>
More than half of Taiwanese FDI stock in the EU (over 250
billion US dollars in 1994) was located in Britain, it added.
</P>
<P>
More than half of Singapore's total FDI abroad was in financial
services with only 20 percent in manufacturing, such as Mayor
PTE's electronic components plant in Britain.
</P>
<P>
North America remains the main investment location beyond Asia.
However, the activities of Asian developing economies in the EU
have gathered momentum.
</P>
<P>
The share of the EU in the total FDI stock from developing Asia
reached about 5 percent in 1995. Though this is still relatively
low, the UNCTAD observes that this does "not reflect neglect, but
rather the fact that Asian firms are just at the beginning of
their entry into Europe."

<HEADLINE> New York City's Economic Performance Lags Behind </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 27 (Xinhua) -- New York City, which
benefited in 1996 from the effect of a record year in the stock
market, lags far behind most of the nation's cities in overall
economic performance, a city report said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In three key measures of economic health -- unemployment, job
growth and the local rate of inflation -- New York City was among
the nation's weakest urban economies, according to the report
issued by the City Comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi.
</P>
<P>
The gross city product, a measures based on total jobs and
income that is similar to the national gross domestic product,
still lagged in the nation, rising only 1.9 percent for the year
compared with a national growth rate of 2.5 percent, said the
report, which is said to be the first major full-year economic
assessment of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Of the nation's 20 largest urban centers, the report said, New
York had the highest unemployment rate for the year, 8.6 percent,
and was outpaced by all but five cities in the percentage growth
of new jobs. And its inflation rate for the year, 2.95 percent,
was surpassed by only two cities, Miami and St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the first half of last year saw the
growth in the city, but since July the economy had slowed
dramatically.

<HEADLINE> Ireland Under Pressure to Amend Bill on Working Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Irish government is under
mounting pressure from U.S. investors to amend a bill adopting the
European Union's (EU) directive of 48-hour working week, according
to reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
A number of leading American multinationals, including
Hewlett-Packard, have warned that lack of flexibility in the
proposed legislation will weaken Ireland's competitiveness as a
location for foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
They also argued that the legislation, which is being reviewed
in the Dail (lower house of the Irish parliament), will eventually
result in job losses.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which represents more than 400
American companies in Ireland employing 60,000 people, said in a
submission to the Dail that it was "no exaggeration to say" the
bill represented "the single most negative change in the past 20
years" in Ireland's drive to attract U.S. investors.
</P>
<P>
Ireland's recent economic boom has been dependent on foreign
investment, which accounts for 75 percent of manufacturing
exports, around half its manufactured output and 45 percent of
employment in manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
Richard Bruton, the Irish enterprise and employment minister,
is due to hold talks with leading U.S. investors in a bid to
appease opponents of the bill.

MOSCOW, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today discussed with Colonel-General Viktor Chechevatov, Commander
of the Far Eastern Military District, about issues of military
reforms.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Press Office said in a statement, Chechevatov
told the president that difficulty exists in the troops of the Far
Eastern Military District, but he assured him the troops are in
control.
</P>
<P>
Chechevatov added that the troops are going on with regular
trainings despite difficult conditions. But he said it was
necessary to prevent any further decline in their combat
capability and to raise their morale.
</P>
<P>
The commander also called for radical, energetic actions from
the government and the military leadership to implement reforms in
the military.
</P>
<P>
He exchanged views with the president on measures to cope with
NATO's eastward plans. "A rejection in principle of the plans for
the expansion of the alliance was confirmed," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
General Chechevatov was received by the president four times
last year to review Russian military reform in the Far East.
</P>
<P>
Chechevatov decided to run for the Russian presidency in
December 1995, but two months before the polling date, announced
his withdrawal from the race in favor of Boris Yeltsin.

<HEADLINE> International Conference on Child Labor Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMSTERDAM, February 27 (Xinhua) -- An international conference
on child labor ended today here calling for an immediate action to
combat its most intolerable forms such as slavery, debt bondage,
prostitution and work in hazardous industries.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 government ministers, trade union leaders, employer
organizations and representatives of working children attended the
two-day round table conference, which was organized by the Dutch
Government and co-hosted by the International Labor
Organization(ILO).
</P>
<P>
The participants agreed that concerted action is required
through integrated policy approaches towards the progressive
elimination of all child labour, with priority given to its most
intolerable forms.
</P>
<P>
"These intolerable forms of child labor are the first concern
for all of us," said Dutch Social Affairs Minister Ad Melkert,
adding that he is convinced that with joint forces the worst forms
of child labour can be banned.
</P>
<P>
Melkert noted that it is essential to keep track of the
advancements of combating child labor.
</P>
<P>
"I therefore find it desirable that in 1999 countries draw up a
binding agreement to reduce child labor," he said.
</P>
<P>
Melkert also noted that he was in favor of a new agreement,
rather than replacing the ILO's current 1973 Minimum Age
Convention.
</P>
<P>
The ILO estimates that nearly a third of the world's 250
million child labourers work under dangerous or harmful conditions.
</P>
<P>
An ILO report prepared for the conference says tens of millions
of child labourers in South Asia are kept in slavery or under
forced labor systems, such as debt bondage.

<P>
The report also notes the increasing sexual exploitation of
children and its terrible effects.
</P>
<P>
"Case studies reveal a trauma so deep that many such children
are unable to return to a normal life. Many others die before
adulthood," the ILO says.
</P>
<P>
The conference is a step towards the drafting of a new
international convention on the worst forms of child exploitation,
said Michel Hansenne, ILO Director-General.
</P>
<P>
"We want a new convention in a global context that will be
possible for all the ILO's members to ratify and to comply with,
shall we say, the minimum rules of the game, and the conference
gives us a good opportunity to discuss this," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai today called on the Palestinians and their
leadership to continue the peace process and to prevent
violence, Israel Radio reported this evening.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai made the remarks after the Israeli government,
despite of strong Palestinian opposition, approved the
construction plan of Har Homa (Jabal Abu Ghneim), a new Jewish
neighborhood in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to senior Israeli army, police and security
officials today in Tel Aviv, Mordechai said the government's
decision on Har Homa "is one of the most significant decisions it
has taken recently."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli defense minister added that the decision could
have both short term and long term consequences.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mordechai said that the Israeli defense
establishment must prepare itself for any eventualities in the
wake of the approval of the Har Homa building plan.
</P>
<P>
Security officials held consultations throughout today on the
situations in the West Bank and on preparation to confront any
potential violence.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the ministerial committee on Jerusalem, headed
by Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, approved the controversial
plans to build 6,500 Jewish homes, in addition to construction
of more housing for Arabs in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Under the plans, some 6,500 units will be built in the Har
Homa, of which 2,450 will be completed in the first three years.
</P>
<P>
In parallel, the Israeli government said it would start
building 3,015 units for Palestinians in 10 existing
neighborhoods within the city limits, though it will boost that
to 9,000 units over an unspecified time.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Accuses Israel of Deliberately Undermining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 27 (Xinhua) - Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul
Karim Kabariti today accused Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu of deliberately undermining six years of the strenuous
efforts of the parties concerned to achieve peace in the Middle
East area, Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti's accusation came as most Arab countries were scolding
Israel for its decision to approve a new Jewish housing project in
East Jerusalem, which Israel seized during the 1967 Middle East
war and later declared its annexation.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti said that King Hussein had sent a letter to Netanyahu,
stating Jordan's firm stand against Israeli government's decision
on the Jewish housing construction plan.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti hoped Israel would heed the king's advice just the
same way Israel had done under the government of former Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti said that Jordan thought the new Jewish settlement in
Jerusalem was very hazardous to the Middle East peace process and
would threaten the good will generated by the signing of the
Hebron agreement in January.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government formally approved the construction
of the new Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Asian Investments in EU Remain Low: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The investments of developed
Asian countries in the European Union and particularly Greece
remain at a low level although the picture is expected to change,
a United Nation's organization report said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the report released in Athens by the U.N.
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), although Asian
countries have become major direct investors internationally, up
to now they have preferred to focus their attention in Southeast
Asia, a region which absorbs two-thirds of invested capital, or
the United States, rather than Europe which accounts for just 5
percent of their investments.
</P>
<P>
The biggest investor in the EU is Japan, followed by South
Korea, while Asian investors display a preference for Britain,
followed by Germany and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the report said, a large portion of Asian
investments have found their way to the countries of Central and
Eastern Europe, where companies have bought and are in the process
of modernizing large production plants.
</P>
<P>
Greece, according to the report, along with Denmark, Finland
and Portugal, are the four EU countries with virtually zero inflow
of Japanese capital for direct investments in the period
1991-1995.
</P>
<P>
Of the developed and developing Asian countries, Japan aside,
Greece has signed bilateral investment agreements only with China
and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Reflective of the situation is the fact that Greece has signed
only one bilateral agreement for the avoidance of double taxation
with an Asian country -- India.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian National Dialogue Held In Nablus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of Various
Palestinian political groups met in Nablus today to have a
"national dialogue" on the future of Palestine, according to a
report of JMCC, a Palestinian press service based in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The national dialogue, initiated by Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat, is aimed at setting the ground for a political
consensus between the Palestinian National Authority and
opposition factions and drawing up a national Platform to address
 challenges of the peace process in the future, especially in
the final-status negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Cabinet Secretary Abdul Rahman said to the Voice of
Palestine radio that all factions welcomed the President Yasser
Arafat's call except "those who sold their destiny to Iran
and some other organizations."
</P>
<P>
He did not identify specific factions but praised some
leaders of the Islamic Jihad for attending the national
dialogue, although Islamic Jihad announced boycott of the meeting
in a communique issued Monday.
</P>
<P>
Both President of the Palestine National Council Salim Zanoun
and President of the Palestinian Council Ahmed Qrei' in their
speechs stressed the importance of forming a unified national
front to preserve the PNA achievements and face future
challenges.
</P>
<P>
The national dialogue, arranged quite some time ago, took
place after the Israeli cabinet Ministerial Committee on Jerusalem
 Affairs approved the construction of a new Jewish settlement at
Har Homa in the Arab east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat condemned the decision while speaking to reporters
before the meeting. He said that the Har Homa decision went
against the Oslo Accords, U.N. resolutions and the U.S.
guarantees in a letter attached to the Hebron agreement signed
last month.
</P>
<P>
"The new challenges, launched by (Binyamin) Netanyahu yesterday,
determined the seriousness of this dialogue and finalized a
sacred document wherein all Palestinian forces would comply with
in order to achieve our difficult aims," Zanoun told the Voice of
Palestine radio.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Asks International Action to Block Israel's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister
Farez Boueiz called here today for a "quick action" by the
international community to prevent Israel from executing a housing
project in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in his office, the foreign minister
warned that the Israeli government's decision to build more
Jewish settlements in Jerusalem will "once again ruin the peace
process" in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Ignoring the prospect of drawing violent reactions of
Palestinians and the Arab, the right-wing Israeli government
gave Wednesday the go-ahead for building thousands of Jewish
homes in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"What the Israeli planned is a project of a new civil
war in Palestine," Boueiz stressed.
</P>
<P>
"It will inevitably drive those wise people, who have made
efforts in handling challenges and pillage of rights, to
desperation and strengthen extremism in all parties," the Lebanese
foreign minister pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"We are calling on the international community, the United
States in its capacity as a sponsor of the Middle East
peace conference, and the secretary general of the United
Nations, to take a quick action in order to put an end to
this new challenge," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli project of building 6,500 Jewish homes in east
Jerusalem was adopted by a special ministerial housing committee
in a Wednesday meeting, and no date for its implementation
has yet been set.
</P>
<P>
The plan must first go to the full cabinet where it is
expected to be easily approved.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians accuse Israel, which claims a united Jerusalem
as its "eternal capital," of seeking to change the city's
demographic make-up to make Israelis a majority.

<HEADLINE> Five People Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Five people were killed and
five others were wounded when a 75 mm anti-tank gun mounted on a
range rover truck made an accidental discharge this afternoon in
south Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
According to the eyewitness, the deceased, four men and a
woman were standing in front of an elementary shop at Marehan
street.
</P>
<P>
One of the ten militiamen on board the range rover said the
gun has discharged itself, but eyewitness confirmed to the
journalist that one of the militiamen has unintentionally touched
the trigger of the loaded gun. The five wounded victims also four
men and a woman were rushed to a treatment center nearby. Two of
the wounded including the woman have received shrapnel in their
abdominal cutting off some of the intestines. Wheelbarrows, the
only available ambulances in Mogadishu were used for evacuating
the wounded who lost a lot of blood on the way.
</P>
<P>
One of the four killed in the incident is a Toyota pickup
driver whose fast running vehicle coincidently come across the
flying round of 75 mm gun cutting off his neck. The round which
went through the Toyota has then exploded in front of the shop
killing the sales woman who was then closing down her business.
</P>
<P>
Quite a number of people die every day for such accidental
discharge of the weapons including the assault rifles and heavy
artillery guns. The reason for accidental discharges is
attributed to the lack of knowledge of the holders of the guns
and the weapons themselves getting out of use. Many of these
weapons do not have saves because their young militia holders cut
them off so as to make the guns easier for them to fire whenever
there is an emergency situation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there has been an exchange of heavy gunfire between
the militiamen of Hussein Mohamed Aidid and those of Osman Hassan
Ali Atto in Bulo Hubey neighborhood of south Mogadishu. At least
one person was killed and two others were wounded when a stray
mortar has landed on a house.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the renewed exchange of fire remains unknown,
however Osman Atto's faction has accused Hussein Aidid's
militiamen for starting the shelling. The shelling targeting the
residential areas has continued until mid day today. There's no
word from Hussein Aidid's side yet over the exchange of fire.

TEHRAN, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today announced that Iran is to launch a satellite
project during the new Iranian calendar year starting from March
21, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Official news agency IRNA reported that Rafsanjani made
the announcement in his two-day tour to inaugurate development
and infrastructural projects in the southern port city of Bushehr.
</P>
<P>
The 64-year-old president said that the project for making
the satellite will be carried out jointly by ministries of
post, telegraph and telephone as well as industry and defense.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not reveal whether Iran will use foreign
technology or investment.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Iran said that it was ready to launch a
satellite called Zohreh (Venus) for telecommunication purposes.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the launching of the satellite was on last year's
agenda of the government since President Rafsanjani announced it
in the fiscal budget for 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, the Persian magazine Payam-e Emrouz and other press
did not reveal whether the satellite was imported or made
inside the country.
</P>
<P>
The report did not mention which foreign company would help
Iran launch the satellite because Iran has no capability of
satellite launching.
</P>
<P>
It reported that Iran has been granted three orbits by
International Telecommunication Union (ITU) for its satellite.

<HEADLINE> Talks on Zairean Peace Make Headway: Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 27 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela said in Pretoria today that progress had been made
in efforts to broker a peace settlement in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"There is progress that is very encouraging," Mandela told
reporters after meeting Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko's
special envoy Honore Ngbanda in Pretoria, the administrative
capital of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mandela declined to give details of progress made in his talks
with both Ngbanda and visiting Zairean rebel leader Laurent
Kabila who arrived in Johannesburg on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, Mandela confirmed that his government had been in
contact with Mobutu, saying Deputy President Thabo Mbeki had met
the Zairean president last week.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his proposed meeting with Mobutu scheduled in
March, Mandela said this was being discussed with Kenyan
President Daniel Arap Moi, who was in charge of the Zairean peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot confirm anything until we also have the support of
President Mobutu", Mandela was quoted by South African Press
Association as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ngbanda, who arrived in South African two days ago, also met a
United States delegation led by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
for African Affairs George Moose.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated on Thursday Mobutu's commitment to finding a
peaceful solution and to saving the lives of innocent people.
This should be done while respecting the territorial sovereignty
of Zaire, Ngbanda said.
</P>
<P>
Multinational talks aimed at ending the Zairean conflict were
reportedly held in Pretoria on Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Zairean rebels launched an offensive last September in attempt
to topple Mobutu's 31-year rule after the government allegedly
tried to expel ethnic tutsis from the east of the country.

</P>
<P>
Ahmed also said the volcano had also wounded six
herdsmen who were watering goats in a water well just near the
mountain.
</P>
<P>
According to the people who were also contacted on the
vhf radio, before the volcano has erupted they have heard a
strange noise and the whole terrain seemed to been shaking below
their feet.
</P>
<P>
According to the Bohol Garas commissioner, the volcano which
erupted two days ago has melted down the rocks and sand and spread
to the nearby terrain where the stream below the mountain and
shallow water well were also buried by the outburst of the
volcano. The surviving animals are reported to have fled the area
and many of them have been lost.
</P>
<P>
So far, no geologists or archaeologists have visited the
region to oversee what has happened there. Nor there is an
international aid agency operating in the area.
</P>
<P>
However, people in the region express concern about a possible
outburst of more volcanos in the nearby mountains.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the authorities have been telling
people to move away from the mountain sides so as to minimize the
catastrophe which might be created if more volcanoes follow.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in the history of Somalia that a
volcano is reported. Gedo region is one of the richest in the
country in terms of the minerals and livestock.
</P>
<P>
The region is usually dry with its people having the tendency
of becoming mine workers. Currently, some of its knowledgeable
people dig some precious stones and bring them for sale in
Mogadishu and elsewhere in the neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Meets US Ambassador on Har Homa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu met with U.S. Ambassador Matin Indyk in Tel
Aviv this afternoon to discuss the controversial government
decision to build a new settlement at Har Homa in East Jerusalem,
Israel radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was arranged after the cabinet's Ministerial
Committee on Jerusalem Affairs made the decision Wednesday evening,
and Indyk relayed a message to Netanyahu from U.S. President Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton Administration expressed "disappointment" Wednesday
over Israel's decision to go ahead with construction of Har
Homa settlement.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters
that the move "is not one that will build trust and confidence,"
which he said ought to be the cornerstone of the
Israeli-Palestinian relationship.
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, the U.S. would have preferred a different decision.
We would have preferred a different decision. We would have
preferred that this decision not have been taken," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Burns called on the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) not to escalate the situation, saying that threats
of violence are "the language of the past."
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. would obviously like to see calm in the occupied
territories, in Jerusalem and throughout Israel," burns
stated.
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to see a disagreement on any issue, including this
issue, resolved peacefully between the Palestinians and the
Israelis," he said. "We reject those who call for violence --
those on either side, Israelis or Palestinians."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the U.S. position, Hanan Ashrawi, PNA Minister
of Higher Education, told Israel Radio today that the U.S. should
have taken steps to prevent Israel to approve the construction of
Har Homa settlement in East Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Welcomes French, European Role in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri reiterated here today his country's welcome for a French
and European role in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Milhem Karam, chairman of the Lebanese
Journalists Association, the prime minister believed that the
European role in the region will be "crystalized no matter
whether with the help of the United States or not."
</P>
<P>
The region has "entered a new stage" after U.S. President
Bill Clinton was re-elected and Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu took power, Hariri said.
</P>
<P>
"Europe is trying to play a role, and we welcome the European
role generally and the French role particularly," Hariri said.
</P>
<P>
"For this reason the Lebanese-French and Syrian-French ties
have been fastly strengthened," he added.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette is scheduled to
visit Israel, Syria and Lebanon next week.
</P>
<P>
Syria has already taken action, Hariri said, describing a
European trip which Syrian Vice President Abdul-Halim Khaddam
and Foreign Minister Farouq al-shara started this morning as
"useful."
</P>
<P>
Khaddam and al-shara arrived in Paris this morning and
delivered to French President Jacques Chirac a message from
Syrian President Hafez Assad.
</P>
<P>
Hariri also declared that he "sensed a good understanding of
the Lebanese position" during his visit to the Vatican and Italy
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese prime minister had a meeting with Pope John Paul
in the Vatican Monday, after which Paul's spokesman announced
that the pope will visit Beirut on May 10 and 11.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Lebanon hope that a more effective European role in
the Middle East will increase the weight of their leverage in
peace negotiations with Israel.

<HEADLINE> African C'Wealth Summit Ends in Botswana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Leaders from Commonwealth's 18
African member states ended their two-day round-table summit in
Botswana's northern resort town of Kasane today, according to a
Ziana report from that city.
</P>
<P>
In a communique released at the end of the summit, the heads
of state underlined that "sustainable democracy could only grow
within societies and could neither be prescribed nor imposed from
outside."
</P>
<P>
In expressing this belief, they referred to the experience of
de-colonialization of the continent and their own national
struggles for political freedom which had been inspired by the
desire to win democratic rights for their peoples.
</P>
<P>
The roundtable summit, organized by the Commonwealth
Secretariat, reviewed progress in the democratization process in
their respective countries since the adoption of the Harare
Commonwealth Declaration of 1991.
</P>
<P>
In the period since the signing of Harare Declaration, the
Africa continent had made considerable progress in democratic
restructuring, said the leaders in the communique.
</P>
<P>
They stressed the ingredients of democracy which included the
right of people to elect freely their government, the primacy of
the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary, the right
of freedom of expression and association and the transparency and
accountability of government.
</P>
<P>
They also noted challenges and impediments in the way of
consolidating democracy, especially poverty, underdevelopment and
tribalism.
</P>
<P>
It needs national effort by all political leaders to cultivate
a culture of tolerance, mutual respect and cooperation to promote
national peace and stability in order to remove the impediments.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria was absent because its membership to the Commonwealth
was suspended at Auckland, New Zealand in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The summit was attended by the presidents or prime ministers
of Botswana, Cameroun, the Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi,
Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, South
Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Ministry today
declared Iranian Erzurum Consul General Saeed Zadeh as persona
non Grata.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Ministry said that it summoned Zadeh
today and asked him to leave Turkey within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Foreign Ministry made the decision as Zadeh made
speeches about the tensions in the Turkish-Iranian relations to
a Turkish private news agency and some television channels
Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Zadeh accused Deputy Chief of General Staff of Turkish Armed
Forces Cevik Bir of making remarks in Washington as
"irresponsible".
</P>
<P>
He said: "some pressure groups dispatched General Bir to
the United States and forced him to make speech."
</P>
<P>
Bir called Iran a supporter of terrorism during a joint
U.S.-Turkish Council meeting in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Iran issued a protest Monday over the remarks by Bir and
said Bir's words were irresponsible, unacceptable and similar to
those by the U.S. and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Ankara and Tehran have been in a diplomatic quarrel
following a controversial speech made by Iranian Ambassador to
Turkey Muhammad Reza Baqeri at the commemoration of "Al-quds
(Jerusalem) Night" on February 1.
</P>
<P>
Baqeri's remarks angered Turkish Foreign Ministry, which
lodged a protest note against its behavior, saying he should
not comment on Turkey's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Baqeri rejected the accusations of the Turkish government,
and left Ankara for Tehran last week, setting off reports that he
had been expelled covertly.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran denied such a report and said that Baqeri
had just returned home for consultations.

<HEADLINE> Yemen Condemns Israeli Decision to Build </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Yemen today condemned an Israeli
decision to build a new Jewish settlement in occupied East
Jerusalem, Yemeni News Agency said today.
</P>
<P>
The agency said the Israeli decision represents further
escalation on the part of Israel, which created an atmosphere of
tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
According to the agency, an official at the Yemeni Foreign
Ministry said that the new Israeli provocation would not help
create an atmosphere of confidence, but would rather dump the
region once more into confrontation and instability.
</P>
<P>
The official, who remained anonymous, said that Yemen was
hereby expressing its strong denunciation of the Israeli move,
appealing to the U.N. Security Council and the international
community, especially the U.S. and European states, to exercise
pressure on Israel to rescind this grave, provocative decision.
</P>
<P>
The official said Yemen wished to reiterate its firm stance on
the peace process and the importance it attaches to the
establishment of a just and comprehensive peace based on the
restoration of legitimate Arab rights and the termination of
Israeli occupation of Arab territories in Palestine, the Golan and
south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Nyerere Urges Implementing Pact on Sino-Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Former Tanzanian
President Julius Nyerere today urged an immediate implementation
of a textile joint venture agreement between Tanzania and
China, saying the delay is costing the government dearly.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere made the call this evening during a visit of the
Urafiki Textile Mill, which, built with Chinese assistance but
mainly managed by local Tanzanians, started production in July
1968 at 95 percent production capacity for a decade before
tumbling to 15 percent in the 1980s due to mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
In order to improve the efficiency and productivity of the
mill, the governments of Tanzania and China signed a joint
venture agreement last October. Its implementation, however, was
stalled owing to a number of reasons.
</P>
<P>
Any further delay would increase the dearly cost experienced
by the Tanzanian government, noted the Tanzanian senior
statesman.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Yu Kaiming, General Manager of the Tanzania China
Friendship Textile Company (TCFTC), told Nyerere that the joint
venture could not take off because of three major snags.
</P>
<P>
The first obstacle was the tedious proceeding of some relative
laws of Tanzania which Yu said had stagnated the project.
</P>
<P>
Another stumbling block was the delay on the part of the
Tanzania government to pay more than 800 would-be retrenchees, as
had been agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
"Huge debts to Tanzania Electric Supply Company, National
Urban Water Authority and the National Provident Fund the mill
owes is another major set back," said the general manager.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, who expressed grave concern over the progress of the
project, said the matter reflected that Tanzania need to address
a lot of problems before it enters the 21st century smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Without technical know-how, a sound infrastructure and good
governance, Tanzania would not be able to enter the new century
emphatically, noted the former president.
</P>
<P>
"Time is money and time waits for no man. Whatever decisions
made should be implemented today and never tomorrow in order to
save both time and money," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere thanked China for entering into joint-venture to bail
the crippled mill out, and challenged workers to take care of it
because the factory was like a cow which produced milk for them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile. Tanzania's deputy minister for industries and
trade, Shamin Khan, told Nyerere while visiting the mill that
most of the bottlenecks to the implementation of the joint
venture had been dealt with.
</P>
<P>
"The main task for the new board, which will soon take over,
will be to finalize the transfer transactions, which we hope will
be smooth," she said, adding that most of the things which
delayed the implementation have been "ironed down".

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Warns Against Israeli Settlement Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today called on Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu not to
take any steps relevant to Jerusalem before reaching an agreement
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
After giving the go-ahead for two oil wells in the northwestern
governorate of Mersa Matruth, which overlooks the Mediterranean,
Mubarak told reporters that he will soon meet with Netanyahu to
discuss the Israeli decision on a new housing project in East
Jerusalem, which has sparked widespread Palestinian demonstrations
as well as fierce criticisms from the U.S. and Arab and European
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government Wednesday approved plans on building
6,500 housing units for the Jewish settlers in Har Homa, a
tree-covered hill taken by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War. An
additional 3,000 homes would be built for Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Instead of imposing a status quo (on East Jerusalem), Israel
should resort to negotiation and take into consideration the
public opinion before taking a decision, Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
"If we do want to achieve peace, then we must solve thorny
issues by negotiation and not by imposing a fait accompli," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said that he had informed Netanyahu, in a phone
conversation Wednesday, that he feared a flare-up of violence
because of Israeli new constructions plan in East Jerusalem, which
the Palestinians want to have as the capital of a Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
On his March 10 trip to Washington, Mubarak said he would
discuss with U.S. President Bill Clinton the peace process and
other pending problems, especially Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu had defended the project as a move to alleviate a
shortage of housing for Arabs and Jews in the city.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians see the project as an Israeli attempt to
strengthen its hold on the holy city and preempt the peace
negotiations set for March to determine the final status of the
occupied territories, including East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"I am afraid the situation will worsen and the peace process be
further compounded as a result of this move," the president said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Palestinian Ambassador to Egypt Zohdi
al-Qodra said today the Israeli move would "lead to overwhelming
rage among the Palestinian people."

<HEADLINE> Thousands in Germany Protest against Visa Requirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Germans and
Foreigners today held demonstrations across Germany in protest
against a government plan to introduce visa requirements for
children from the main origin countries of Germany's immigrant
workers.
</P>
<P>
In Berlin, about 2000 people took to the street and formed a
human chain around the city's town hall.
</P>
<P>
Another human chain also surrounded the Michel church in
Hamburg while thousands of school children boycotted lessons in
response to a call from Germany's Turkish community which
described the visa requirements as "discriminating and hostile to
the family".
</P>
<P>
According to German media reports, demonstrations were also
staged in cities like Stuttgart, Kiel and Neumuester.
</P>
<P>
Under previous regulations, children under 16 years of age from
Turkey, Morocco, Tunisia and the former Yugoslavia do not need to
apply for visa when they come to visit their parents working in
Germany. They are also exempted from residential permit
requirements. But these exemptions are due to be lifted under a
decree issued by the German Interior Ministry in January.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations will only come into effect if they are
approved by April 15 by the German upper house of parliament where
the opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) controls a majority.
The SPD reportedly is calling for changes to the decree.
</P>
<P>
The German trade union federation DGB was quoted by the German
news agency DPA as saying that the new decree was a false signal
to be sent in the European Year Against Racism. It also said that
the new regulations would work against efforts to integrate
immigrant workers' children born in the country into German
society.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Commercial courts will
be established next July to expedite the settlement of tax
claims, implement appropriate sanctions on tax offenders and
ensure that tax arrears will be minimized.
</P>
<P>
Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Finance Peter Ngumbullu
told a high-level policy meeting between Tanzania and Japan here
today that by next June, the government will also have adopted an
action plan for increasing the tax base.
</P>
<P>
"This will include ways of taxing sectors like agriculture and
mining whose contribution to the tax effort continues to be
insignificant relative to their importance to the economy," he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Daily News, the principal secretary
told the meeting at kilimajaro hotel that ways of increasing tax
compliance will also be studied, adding that preparations for the
introduction of the value added tax (VAT) scheduled for next June
will also continue.
</P>
<P>
He told the participants of the meeting which is also attended
by Japan's special assistant to the Minister for foreign Affairs
Michio Mizoguchi that there has been important improvement in tax
administration since the formation of the Tanzania Revenue
Authority (TRA).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Minister for Finance Daniel Yona said Tanzania aims
to increase trade with Japan and attract more investment from it.
</P>
<P>
Opening the high level policy discussions between Tanzania and
Japan earlier, Yona said Tanzania is glad to note that more
Japanese private companies are investing in the country.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister told the meeting that the government is
designing aid strategies whereby external assistance will be
concentrated on a few key sectors in the economy.
</P>
<P>
He cited the priority sectors as agriculture, education,
health, water, energy, communication, transport, environment and
promotion of private sector development.
The talks will continue tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> French Economists Optimistic about Economic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 27 (Xinhua) -- French economists have expressed
optimism over the perspective of France's economic cooperations
with China, and have called for a more aggressive engagement in
the Chinese market, said local media reports.
</P>
<P>
"There are fantastic potentials (in the Chinese market),
especially when you go down to different regions and out of
Beijing to meet the Chinese enterprises," the daily Le Figaro
quoted an official of the Ministry of Exterior Trade of France as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The Delegate Minister for Finance and Exterior Trade of France,
Yve Galland, is presently leading a delegation of both small and
medium French business leaders and large entrepreneurs on a visit
in China to seek contracts with Chinese enterprises in Shanghai,
Tianjin and Liaoning.
</P>
<P>
The economic daily Les Echos said that although bilateral trade
between France and China has been rising since the beginning of
1990s, France now only shares 2 percent of the Chinese market, as
is compared with 17 percent by Japan, 8 percent by the United
States, and 5.5 percent by Germany.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, France's export to China stood at 12.4 billion francs
(2.4 billion U.S. dollars), while its import from China was valued
at 30 billion francs (6 billion U.S. dollars), said the daily.
</P>
<P>
French economists said that France is particularly interested
in cooperating with China in the fields of airspace industry,
agriculture and food industries, energy, insurance and financial
services.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac will inaugurate a big
exposition gathering products from 250 major French enterprises in
Shanghai, when he pays a state visit to China in mid-May, said
local press reports.
</P>
<P>
Laure Mellerio, secretary general of the France-China Committee
of the Conseil National du Patronat Francais (CNPF), said that
French enterprises should be more engaged in China's
infrastructure construction, such as building roads, improving the
means of transport, developing telecommunication networks, and
exploiting energy products.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro quoted other economists as saying that France could
win contracts in China's automobile equipments industry, chemical
industry, fashion accessories factories, and food industry.
</P>
<P>
The French enterprises which have been operating in China, such
as Alcatel Alstholm, Citroen, Renault, L'Air Liquide, Schneider,
Lafarge, Carrefour, Galeries Lafayette and Printemps, are also
optimistic about their future businesses in China, according to Le
Figaro.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Urges Integration of Small National </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Minister for
Communications and Transport William Kusila today stressed the
need for small national airlines to integrate so as to survive
stiff competition in air transportation.
</P>
<P>
"It is a reality that as competition continues and grows the
small national airlines cannot survive on their own. They should
better integrate, otherwise they would finally succumb to the
situation," said the minister when opening the Royal Dutch
Airlines (KLM) and Kenya Airways joint offices here.
</P>
<P>
The minister said small national airlines could develop a
beneficial relationship with airlines of advanced countries
without perceiving themselves as juniors.
</P>
<P>
He also said they could get a successful technology transfer
and manpower development project through the integration.
</P>
<P>
"There are other arenas such as distribution, marketing,
pooling of spares, joint placement of insurance and use of
computer reservations system in which interests of the parties
may be compatible," Kusila pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"At the end of the day we cannot underate the fact that as
corporate entities with separate identities, the survivability of
each is paramount," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kusila expressed hopes that through their
partnership, the two airlines would make efforts to develop and
improve tourism in Tanzania, adding that the government hoped to
see a steady increase in frequencies of air services to the
country.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, KLM vice-president and African area manager, Ron
Sohipper, and Kenya Airways managing director and chief
executive, Brial Davies, promised that the two airlines would
offer better services at competitive prices.
</P>
<P>
Dar es Salaam is their first joint office in Africa Under the
partnership, which was effected last November. KLM holds 26
percent shares.

<HEADLINE> Researcher Says Low-fat Milk May Trigger Diabetes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- A medical researcher said on
Wednesday that he had evidence that milk and dairy products could
trigger diabetes in people predisposed to developing the disease,
said a report in today's Daily Telegraph.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Bob Elliott, a professor of Auckland Medical
School of New Zealand, as saying that he believed the cause was a
mutant protein known as beta casein A1, found in low-fat,
high-protein milk.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an international dairy conference in Palmerston in
northern New Zealand, Elliott said the findings, if further
proved, would have implications for the dairy industry worldwide,
which, in the past two decades, has switched to breeding cattle
specifically to meet consumer demand for lower-fat milk.
</P>
<P>
The professor added that the more traditional, higher-fat milk
contained a different form of protein known as A2, which was
harmless.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Calls for Doing a Good Job with HK, Macao Affairs (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- It is a popular trend and
common aspiration of the entire Chinese people to accomplish the
smooth transfer of Hong Kong's political power to China and
maintain its long-term prosperity and stability, President Jiang
Zemin said here today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also general secretary of the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of China (CPC), made the remark when
meeting Hong Kong and Macao members of the National Committee of
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) in
Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
With the joint efforts of six million Hong Kong compatriots,
the backing of a growing prosperous and strong China, and the full
support of the 1.2 billion Chinese people, Jiang said, Hong Kong
is bound to have a smooth transition and a smooth transfer of
power, and to keep long-term prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
At 3 pm, Jiang Zemin, Li Ruihuan went to Beijing Hotel along
with Qian Qichen and Wang Zhaoguo to join Hongkong members in a
panel discussion and listened to their views and proposal.
</P>
<P>
In a lively atmosphere, the members suggested ways and means
for Hong Kong's smooth return and Macao's transition and their
long-term prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
They held that Hong Kong's return to the embrace of the
motherland is a focus of world attention, which should be
attributed Deng Xiaoping's scientific concept of "one country, two
systems".
</P>
<P>
They said they will forever bear in the mind Deng Xiaoping's
great contributions to national reunification, and that they fully
support the policies of "one country, two systems", "Hong Kong
people governing Hong Kong", and "a high degree of autonomy".
</P>
<P>
As members of China's top government advisory body, they will
further promote cooperation and exchanges between Hong Kong, Macao
and the interior areas.
</P>
<P>
Hearing the members' speeches, Jiang Zemin said 1997 will be an
extraordinary year in the history of our country's development.
China will accomplish two major events of world attention: One is
</P>
<P>
that CPC will convene its 15th National Congress, which will
launch the reform and opening-up and socialist modernization drive
into the new century; and the other is that the Chinese government
will resume the exercise of its sovereignty over Hong Kong, and
the other is the other is that the Chinese government will resume
the exercise of its sovereignty over Hong Kong, which will bring
Hong Kong to a splendid future with increased prosperity and
stability under the principles of "one country, two systems",
"Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and "a high degree of
autonomy".

<P>
The destiny of Hong Kong compatriots has always been related to
that of all Chinese people and the Chinese nation, so has Hong
Kong region's development with that of the motherland, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The tremendous achievements changing with each passing day
China has made in its reform and opening-up and modernization
drive, and the bright prospects for the all-round revitalization
of the Chinese nation, shall serve as a reliable guarantee for
Hong Kong's progress to a splendid future.
</P>
<P>
The overall situation in Hong Kong is good at present, he said,
so is its development in economy, culture and other aspects. From
a political point of view, the resumption of the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong by the Chinese government will create a
premise for Hong Kong progress toward democracy.
</P>
<P>
The ideas of "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong, and a high
degree of autonomy", he noted, will bring about a historic change
in the political status and political life for Hong Kong
compatriots.
</P>
<P>
Jiang recalled that at the end of last year, Hong Kong
compatriots elected the first chief executive of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) through open, fair and
impartial democratic procedures, and the chief executive obtained
the appointment of the central people's government.
</P>
<P>
"This was the first time that Hong Kong compatriots had truly
exercised their democratic rights of being the master of their own
destiny," the president noted.
</P>
<P>
Recently, he continued, the State Council has appointed 23
chief officials for the first government of the Hong Kong SAR
based on the nomination of the chief executive. And work in other
respects are being undertaken in a planned and steady way.
</P>
<P>
The smooth return of Hong Kong is a foregone conclusion, he
said. People have a deeper understanding of the central
government's determination to implement the policies of "one
country, two systems" and "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong,
and a high degree of autonomy", and Hong Kong compatriots are
fully confident about Hong Kong's future.

The Chinese government's resumption of the exercise of its
sovereignty over Hong Kong is a significant step in achieving the
great cause of the peaceful reunification of the motherland, which
will be followed by the return of Macao and solution of the Taiwan
issue, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
"Doing a good job with Hong Kong's return will facilitate
Macao's return in 1999, the eventual solution of the Taiwan issue
and accomplishment of the complete reunification of the
motherland,"the president said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Hong Kong compatriots will, under
the banner of patriotism and love for Hong Kong, will continue to
adhere to the basic law and relevant decisions by the National
People's Congress to do well the various jobs in preparing for the
establishment of the Hong Kong SAR, overcome all interferences,
and lay a solid foundation for the smooth transfer of political
power and the normal operation of the SAR starting July 1.
</P>
<P>
Members from Hong Kong and Macao have played a very good role
in their involvement of government affairs, Jiang pointed out.
After Hong Kong's return, the CPPCC will continue to draw
representatives from among Hong Kong compatriots, to provide
better conditions for their participation in deliberation of
government affairs.
</P>
<P>
He added the CPPCC will listen more to their proposals and
suggestions, give full rein to their important role in China's
political, economic, cultural and social life.
</P>
<P>
"After Hong Kong's return, the channels for Hong Kong
residents' participation in state affair will be more effective,
and matters in various aspects increasingly managed better," Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, Jiang cited the Fifth Session of the Eighth
CPPCC National Committee an important meeting, and urged CPPCC
members from Hong Kong and Macao to speak out freely and raise
more proposals, so as to turn China into a still better country.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, also
spoke at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there are only 123 days off from Hong Kong's return
today, Li said the CPPCC members, fully confidence in Hong Kong's
future, are discussing state affairs with in a peaceful mood,
thanks to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's great concept of "one country,
two systems".

<HEADLINE> HK Companies Support China's National Treatment Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 28 (Xinhua) -- About half of Hong Kong's
companies engaged in manufacturing and trading on the Chinese
mainland supported the policy of national treatment, according to
the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (TDC).
</P>
<P>
Another 11.3 percent said this measure was beneficial to their
investment in the mainland, a survey report of TDC shows.
</P>
<P>
The report was based on two surveys, in which a total of 990
companies were approached.
</P>
<P>
To collect the views of local businesses on China's Ninth
Five-year Plan (1996-2000), a questionnaire survey targeted at
commercial and industrial enterprises engaging in processing trade
on the mainland was conducted last October. In January 1997, a
telephone survey focusing on services companies acquainted with
China's tertiary sector was carried out.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the liberalization of the services
sector, an important issue in the plan, was generally supported by
Hong Kong services providers. Half of those surveyed reckoned that
the move was of "great advantage" to their investment in the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the priority development of energy,
infrastructure and high-technology projects under the plan, 10
percent of the respondents found the policy of "great" advantage
to their investment, pointing out that it both increases
investment opportunities and helps improve the investment
environment.
</P>
<P>
The report also showed that in general, Hong Kong companies
were satisfied with the investment environment "hardware" on the
mainland, but found the investment environment "software" had much
room for improvement.
</P>
<P>
As far as "hardware" was concerned, close to 80 percent of the
respondents agreed that "transportation facilities" were better
than two or three years ago, while 63 percent indicated that
"infrastructure facilities" had improved.
</P>
<P>
As for "software", 51 percent of those surveyed reckoned that
"production efficiency" had been upgraded, 62 percent pointed out
that "product quality control" had made an improvement, and 41
percent found an increase in "opportunities in the domestic
market".
</P>
<P>
With regard to areas which required urgent improvement,
"unreasonable charges" topped the list. Some 78 percent of the
respondents pointed out that the malpractice of "charging taxes
and miscellaneous fees in day-to-day operation" had become worse.
</P>
<P>
Under the present investment conditions, 49 percent of the
respondents who are engaged in trade and manufacturing still
planned to increase their investment in the mainland over the next
few years, while 87 percent of those in the services sector had
the same plans.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 28 (Xinhua) -- China qualified for the
final of the Dunhill Cup soccer tournament with a 3-1 victory over
Zimbabwe in a semi-final here Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
China led 2-0 at half time.
</P>
<P>
The slippery pitch following the downpour here made it
difficult for both teams.
</P>
<P>
The Africans, more familiar playing in such conditions, settled
down faster and had two brilliant opportunities in the first 20
minutes.
</P>
<P>
In the 17th minute, Gilbert Mushangazhike's left-foot shot hit
the post. Three minutes later, Masimba Dinyero had a powerful
shot, but saved by Chinese goalie Ou Chuliang.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese eleven made up for several earlier misses
when it netted two goals in seven minutes. At the 22nd minute into
the game, Fan Zhiyi, receiving a pass from Peng Weiguo, opened the
scoring with a header.
</P>
<P>
Seven minutes later, Li Ming tapped in a cross from Hao Haidong
for a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
Just two minutes into the second half, the match was halted for
20 minutes when the lights at the stadium went off.
</P>
<P>
The delay due to the blackout did not affect China's rhythm in
the second half as it maintained its pressure on the Africans.
</P>
<P>
China sealed the match with the third goal in the 58th minute
through Fan Zhiyi who again headed in Peng Wei Guo's freekick from
outside the penalty box.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe got a consolation goal just two minutes before the
long whistle through substitute Morgan Nkathazo.

NEW DELHI, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Front government
places priority on science and technology in the new budget for
1997-98 which doubles its allocation fund over the previous fiscal
year, Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said today.
</P>
<P>
Chidambaram, who presented the budget to parliament this
evening, proposed to increase three billion rupees (84.51 million
US dollars) for the country's science and technology sector.
</P>
<P>
The scheme to match every commercial rupee earned by national
laboratories and Indian institutes of technology with an equal
amount of government money, introduced last year, will continue on
a permanent basis, providing additional revenues for science and
technology.
</P>
<P>
The budgetary outlay for defense will be 356.2 billion rupees
(10.03 billion US dollars), up by 66 billion rupees (1.86 billion
US dollars) over the 1996-97 budget allocation.
</P>
<P>
A new bill would be introduced to deal strongly with money
laundering. A new policy would be formulated for exploration in
oil and gas in the country and new incentives for investment by
foreign investors and non-resident Indians would be also
introduced, the finance minister said.
</P>
<P>
About 75 billion rupees (2.11 billion US dollars) are being
earmarked for food grains and sugar subsidies in the new budget,
an increase of 14.34 billion rupees (403.94 million US dollars)
over last year. Subsidy on locally made fertilizers will rise to
52.4 billion rupees (1.48 billion US dollars) from 47.43 billion
rupees (1.34 billion US dollars) for 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
Total expenditure is estimated at 2.325 trillion rupees (65.488
billion US dollars) while total receipts at existing rates of
taxation are estimated at 2.319 trillion rupees (65.32 billion US
dollars) for 1997-98. The balance of 1.696 trillion rupees (47.78
billion US dollars) is for non-plan expenditure, the finance
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Net external assistance is expected to be 24.35 billion rupees
(685.92 million US dollars) for 1997-98, he said.

He added that the note would have a special dye that changes
color depending on the angle of viewing, among 22 devices designed
to make it more counterfeiting-proof.

Hu Jintao, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, made the call at a group
discussion with members of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) who are here
attending the committee's annual session.
</P>
<P>
He said, "To accomplish this historic task, we must arm our
minds more conscientiously with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory and
adhere to the basic line of the Party unswervingly under any
conditions.
</P>
<P>
"It also requires us to unite more closely around the Party
Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core, strengthen and
improve Party leadership, keep consolidating and improving
party building, further enhance the level of administration and
leadership."
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he said, it is necessary for people of
different ethnic groups across the country to unite as one, work
with one heart and one mind, pool their collective wisdom and
strength, and bring such wisdom and strength into full play.
</P>
<P>
Attending the discussion were CPPCC National committee members
from the Youth League, All-China Youth Federation, All-China
Federation of Taiwan Compatriots, All-China Federation of Returned
Overseas Chinese, and the CPPCC National Committee social welfare
group.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that people's organizations they belong to are important
channels for the Party and the government to contact the masses
and overseas compatriots.
</P>
<P>
He expressed high appreciation for these organizations which he
said have united and exerted a positive influence on people they
have contacts with and played an indispensable role in pushing
forward reform, opening up and modernization in China as well as
the cause of reunification and re-invigoration of the country.
</P>
<P>
Hu said CPPCC National Committee members, as representatives of
various social circles, should correctly reflect the views of the
public and offer more advices and suggestions for the Party and the
government.
</P>
<P>
Members should also play a good role in bridging different
ideas, dissolving contradictions, and stimulating and protecting
initiatives of people in all fields, in order to maintain a close
unity of the people around the Party and the government, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hu called on members of the CPPCC National Committee to further
improve their work this year in accordance with plans of the
central authorities, hold even higher the great banner of Deng
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, follow the correct path Deng Xiaoping pointed out
for CPPCC work in the new period, and make greater contributions to
the modernization drive, reunification and rejuvenation of China.
</P>
<P>
Other participants of the group discussion expressed views or
raised suggestions on studying Deng Xiaoping's theory on united
front work, strengthening education and scientific research, and
enriching socialist literature and arts, among others.

<HEADLINE> Emotions Prevail Over Rational Senses: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Emotions often prevail over
rational senses when a person is faced with difficult decisions,
an American study showed.
</P>
<P>
Scientists in the United States found that unconscious
emotional signals - intuition or a "hunch" - take part in
decision-making well before conscious thoughts do, the journal
Science reported today.
</P>
<P>
A research team of the University of Iowa College of Medicine,
Iowa City, made the conclusion after studying patients who find
difficulty making up their minds when faced with risks.
</P>
<P>
Comparing the gambling ability of a group of brain-damaged
patients with that of normal individuals, they found that people
rely on a range of emotional cues when making decisions.
</P>
<P>
The discovery fits in with previous experiment results.
Psychologists already find that when people face tricky decisions,
such as choosing their spouses or buying new cars, they usually
draw on more than just rational thought and let feelings get their
own way in the process of decision-making.

BONN, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Germany's rail transport of
nuclear waste began today amid strong anti-nuclear protests, under
the protection of the country's biggest police operation since
World War II.
</P>
<P>
The first of a total of six containers carrying highly
radio active nuclear waste left Bavaria's Gundremmingen power
station for Walheim in neighboring Baden-Wuerttemberg state, where
it will join three others from Germany and two from France in the
afternoon.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Germany's rail transport of
nuclear waste began today amid strong anti-nuclear protests, under
the protection of the country's biggest police operation since
World War II.
</P>
<P>
The first of a total of six containers carrying highly
radio active nuclear waste left Bavaria's Gundremmingen power
station for Walheim in neighboring Baden-Wuerttemberg state, where
it will join three others from Germany and two from France in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The special train shipping the spent nuclear fuel rods is due
to reach a temporary underground storage depot at Gorleben in
Germany's northern state of Lower-Saxony on March 2.
</P>
<P>
Police have detained about 100 people trying to block heavy
lorries carrying the three containers from the nuclear power
station in Baden-Wuerttemberg, where the train from Bavaria was
stranded for about 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Security cost for the transport is estimated around 100 million
marks (60 million U.S. dollars), compared to 46 million marks for
the last such transport.
</P>
<P>
Thirty thousand police officers are mobilized for shielding the
shipment. Supported by crack federal border troops, they are
heavily armed and will be deploying armored personnel carriers,
helicopters and water cannons.
</P>
<P>
Last year's Gorleben trip led to massive demonstrations, mostly
peaceful. However police used water cannons to clear people
blocking railway lines and there were attacks on police by masked
left-wing extremists who hurled stones.
</P>
<P>
The high security cost is part of the anti-nuclear lobby's
strategy trying to drive the price of nuclear power through the
ceiling.
</P>
<P>
In the recent protest over this year's nuclear transport,
anti-nuclear activists allegedly sabotaged overhead power lines
for electric trains and railway signal facilities to disrupt rail
services.
</P>
<P>
Violent protest has also fueled heated debate in parliament.
Government parties accused the Greens Party of encouraging people
against the rule of law and as a result to undermine democracy.
</P>
<P>
The Greens and the Party of Democratic Socialism (PSD) want a
ban on nuclear waste transport and have supported the recent mass
protest.

<HEADLINE> Qiao Shi: Supervision Is Welcome (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese senior Party leader
Qiao Shi said here today that the Communist Party of China (CPC)
sincerely welcomes supervision from the non-Communist parties, and
urged Party officials at all levels to pay close attention to and
modestly accept suggestions and criticisms from the non-Communist
parties.
</P>
<P>
Qiao, a member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central
Committee's Political Bureau, this afternoon paid a visit to
members of the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), which started its fifth
annual session Thursday in Beijing, and joined them in a group
discussion.
</P>
<P>
After listening to several CPPCC National Committee members
from various non-Communist parties, who focused on the
achievements of the CPPCC and its future development, Qiao said
that he was very glad to have the opportunity to join the
discussion and hear the members' opinions.
</P>
<P>
"You have just put forth some great ideas and proposals that
are very inspiring, and some problems you mentioned really deserve
close attention and should be addressed in practical work," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the multi-party cooperation and political
consultation system under the CPC leadership, Qiao stressed that
it is of critical importance for China's development that the
CPC and the non-Communist parties preserve a relationship of
long-term co-existence and mutual supervision.
</P>
<P>
"During the period of democratic revolution and since the
founding of New China in 1949, especially since the reform and
opening up began in 1978, the CPC has had close cooperation with
the non-Communist parties, and will continue to do so in future,"
he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Qiao said that the CPC welcomes more brotherly supervision by the
non-Communist parties, and called on Party officials across the
country to treat the non-Communist parties with openness and
sincerity, to give political consultation a more prominent
role.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that "one country, two systems" is a
principle of the CPC for the solution of the Taiwan question, and
that more efforts are needed for the realization of China's
reunification.
</P>
<P>
"We are already very close to the resumption of the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong, and Macao will also return to the
embrace of the motherland very soon. This has fully proved the
correctness and feasibility of the strategic concept of 'one
country, two systems' set forth by Deng Xiaoping," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Guided by this great concept, we will certainly achieve the
complete reunification of the motherland," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qiao, who is also chairman of the Standing Committee of the
Eighth National People's Congress (NPC), China's legislature, also
dealt on the general situation of China's reform and opening up,
economic development, and the building of democracy and a legal
system.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that one of Deng Xiaoping's great contributions
is to have explored and led China onto a road of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
"We have made great achievements along this road," he said.
"And by marching forward unswervingly on the road, we will surely
make our country stronger and more prosperous, and further improve
the life of the people."
</P>
<P>
He finally expressed the hope that CPPCC members would provide
more ideas and proposals for the Party and the government, and
wished the CPPCC National Committee every success in various
aspects of work.
</P>
<P>
Qiao was accompanied by Ye Xuanping and Dong Yinchu, vice
chairmen of the CPPCC National Committee.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Holds Talks with Beninese FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen expressed satisfaction over the
smooth development of bilateral relations between China and Benin
here today.
</P>
<P>
Since the two countries restored their diplomatic relations in
1972, friendly co-operation in various sectors have been fruitful
and exchanges of high-level visits have been frequent, which have
deepened the mutual understanding and trust between the two
nations, Qian noted, during talks with visiting Beninese Foreign
Minister Pierre Osho.
</P>
<P>
Osho, on behalf of President Mathieu Kerekou and Benin's
government and people, first expressed condolences over the death
of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, lauding him as a "great friend"
of the people of Benin.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed his gratitude, and said that China will
steadfastly stride along the road of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics, which was initiated by Deng, the
architect of China's modernization drive and the reform and
opening up policy.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed appreciation over the long-term close
co-operation and mutual support between China and Benin in
international affairs. He also thanked the Beninese government for
sticking to its "one China" policy and not having any official
relations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
China emphasizes the development of economic and trade
relations with Benin, Qian said, and the two countries have reaped
satisfactory results through co-operation in various forms. China
is willing to actively explore new fields and channels of
cooperation together with Benin, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Osho said that although the two countries are far apart
geographically, the two peoples are emotionally close, and Benin
is proud to have such a great friend as China.
</P>
<P>
President Kerekou and the Beninese government attach great
importance to the development of bilateral relations, Osho said,
and Benin, grateful to China for its long-term support, is willing
to continue its co-operation with China in different spheres.
</P>
<P>
After the talks the two sides exchanged letters on the
continued existence of an honorary consulate of Benin in Hong Kong
after China resumes its exercise of sovereignty over the territory.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers also signed an agreement on the
mutual exemption of visas between Benin and the future Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region.

<HEADLINE> Kinkel Proposes to Ease Russian Concern Over NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 28 -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel today
floated the idea to limit the stationing of conventional weapon
systems in east European candidate countries in a bid to ease
Russia's concerns over the NATO eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel said in a speech to the German parliament that Russian
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov had told him of Moscow's concern
that NATO's military machine would advance on the Russian border.
</P>
<P>
"We can and must clear away these Russian concerns," he said.
</P>
<P>
A solution would be to limit deployment of foreign weapons in
the candidate states to a certain percent of territorial limits
agreed under an amended Treaty on Conventional Force in Europe,
Kinkel said.
</P>
<P>
He added that such limits could be monitored through an
improved system of military inspection and exchange of information.
</P>
<P>
At its Madrid summit last July, NATO is expected to select
candidates from east European countries with which it will begin
membership negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Russia at present still remains strongly against the NATO
expansion plan. It has demanded a legal-binding document on its
relations with NATO. The latter, however, only wants a charter
which does not need the approval of member states' parliaments.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Foreign Exchange Reserves Doubled: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's foreign exchange
reserves have doubled to 1.08 billion U.S. dollars in the last few
days, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said today.
</P>
<P>
The rapid increase in the foreign exchange reserves was due to
tremendous responses by Pakistanis at home and abroad to his call
for donations, Sharif said while addressing a meeting in Lahore,
the capital city of Punjab Province.
</P>
<P>
People from all over the country and abroad have been
participating with devotion, enthusiasm and determination in the
debt repayment program, he said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that with the massive participation of the people in
the improvement of foreign exchange reserves, Pakistan would be
able to divert huge amounts for the development projects.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the devotion and dedication of the people, there was
no need to beg for loans from any international agency, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped that Pakistan would be able to stand on its own
feet very soon.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's foreign debt stood at around 30 billion dollars
while its foreign exchange reserves had been left no more than 600
million dollars when Sharif was sworn in on February 17 as new
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Sharif appealed last Sunday in his first televised speech to
both resident and overseas Pakistanis to come forward and help him
overcome the country's economic crisis.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Casts Doubt on 1997 Budget, Calls for Military Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said Friday that he doubts that the 1997 federal budget targets
can be met and called for "real and profound" reforms in the
military.
</P>
<P>
In a radio address to the nation, Yeltsin said he was very
reluctant to sign the law on the 1997 budget on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"It is very doubtful the budget can be fulfilled," Yeltsin
said, "because the government has not done enough about it, and
has included unrealistic elements in it."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the amendments on the budget put forward by the
State Duma (lower house of parliament) was dominated by "populism
and lobbies" that had even worsened the budget.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin explained that he had signed the budget "because
rejecting it would mean aggravating the political situation in
Russia, and a new wave of instability would hit the least
protected citizens the hardest."
</P>
<P>
But he said he would exercise more careful control over the
drafting of the budget for next year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the military, Yeltsin criticized the phenomenon of
officers stealing properties, and veteran soldiers bullying new
ones.
</P>
<P>
Calling for "real and profound military reforms" and reduction
of the armed forces, he pointed out that the necessity was to make
the military meet the needs of today and future, and adapt to the
changing international situation and domestic reforms.
</P>
<P>
The main task is to enhance the quality of the military, and
facilitate its professionalization process in the long run,
Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
Recently Defense Minister Igor Rodionov has been campaigning
for more funding for the army, saying reforms are impossible
without additional money.
</P>
<P>
Rebuking him on Wednesday, Yeltsin said the minister should
stop "whining" and get down to the task of reforming the army.

<HEADLINE> Liu Huaqing on Work of CPPCC, Army Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Liu Huaqing, vice-chairman of
the Central Military Commission, joined today a group discussion,
part of activities of the ongoing session of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), China's top advisory body, and made a speech
on the work of the CPPCC and army building.
</P>
<P>
CPPCC National Committee members specially invited from
provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities and the army
attended the discussion.
</P>
<P>
After listening to their opinions and suggestions, Liu talked
about the necessity to earnestly study Deng Xiaoping's
instructions on the work of the CPPCC and called for members to do
a better job of serving as advisors for the Chinese Communist
Party (CPC) and the government.
</P>
<P>
Liu is also a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau
of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We should unswervingly hold high the banner of
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, advance the cause of socialist reform, opening up
and modernization under the leadership of the CPC Central
Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core by implementing policies
formulated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping."
</P>
<P>
Liu said the People's Liberation Army is loyal to the Party,
the motherland and the people and worthy of the trust of people of
different ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's ideas on building the
army in the new period, the PLA has made remarkable progress in
revolutionization, modernization and standardization, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Central Military Commission Jiang Zemin's
proposal of arming the people's army with correct ideas and
hi-tech is of important guiding significance for the army, Liu
said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the rapid development of high and new technologies
in the world today, Liu said, "We must work even harder to grasp
them, in order to improve the overall quality of the army and
enhance the level of its modernization."
</P>
<P>
He quoted Deng as saying that stability takes precedence over
everything else, and that there will not be development without
stability. "The work of the CPPCC should also serve this
objective," he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that members of the top advisory body
would establish more extensive ties with people, listen to their
views, and actively provide suggestions for the Party and the
government.

<HEADLINE> Tory Loses Parliamentary Majority After Key By-election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Britain's ruling Conservative
Party lost parliamentary majority after losing a key by-election
in Wirral South in northwestern England, putting Labor leader Tony
Blair in a stronger position for a general election.
</P>
<P>
The Labor victory, timed just weeks before the general
election, reduced the chances of a triumph by Prime Minister John
Major in the general elections which must be held by May.
</P>
<P>
On an unusually high turnout for a by-election of 73 percent,
Labor candidate Ben Chapman received 22,767 votes in Wirral South,
7,888 votes more than the 14,879 of his Conservative rival Les
Byrom.
</P>
<P>
"The public are totally disenchanted with the present
government," said Chapman, who took the place of the late Tory MP,
Barry Porter, in Wirral South.
</P>
<P>
The Conservatives won Wirral South by 8,183 votes in last
general election.
</P>
<P>
Immediately knowing the result, a Labor spokesman said: "No
party has ever lost a by-election so close to a general election,
in a seat they had won at the previous general election, and gone
on to win the general election."
</P>
<P>
The crushing victory of Labor, with 17 percent swing, reflected
the party's 20 percent lead in popularity in national opinion
polls.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the result, Labor's deputy leader John Prescott
said: "The people of Wirral South have rejected the Tories'
negative campaign and backed new Labor's positive pledges on
education, health, crime, jobs and taxes."
</P>
<P>
However, the defeated Byrom was not disheartened.
</P>
<P>
"I intend to be back in the general election in a very few
weeks time. I believe Britain's future is with John Major and we
will win the general election," he said.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that Labor's gain of the Tories' 126th most
marginal seat will hammer government morale and bolster Labor
hopes of an outright majority in the coming general election.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Turkey was concerned about
the Israeli government's decision to build new Jewish settlements
in east Jerusalem, a Turkish Foreign Ministry statement said
today.
</P>
<P>
"While the tragic events occurred in Autumn with the opening
of the archeological tunnel passing beneath of the Al Aqsa Mosque
have not been forgotten and the status of Jerusalem and the final
negotiations are expected to start soon, the project for the new
Jewish settlements announced recently has caused worries about
the success of the Middle East peace process," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that Israel should reconsider its policy
on the building of the new Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Turkey expressed the hope that all the sides concerned should
make constructive contributions to a lasting, comprehensive and
just peace and stability in the region, it added.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Ministerial Committee on Jerusalem Affairs approved
Wednesday the construction of 6,500 housing units in Har Homa of
east Jerusalem. The committee also allowed another 3,015 homes to
be built for Arabs.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government's action to open an archaeological
tunnel entrance next to Muslim holy sites last September set off
three days of riots which killed more than 70 people, most of them
Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Senna Trial Judge Rejects Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The judge at the Ayrton Senna
manslaughter trial rejected challenges from two of the defendants
on Friday and ruled that proceedings against all six accused
should move ahead.
</P>
<P>
The judge, Antonio Costanzo, adjourned the trial until March 5,
when the prosecution is due to present its case.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian Senna, three times world champion, died at the San
Marino Formula One Grand Prix on May 1, 1994 when his Williams car
hurtled off the track at Imola, Italy, and smashed into a wall at
around 200 kph.
</P>
<P>
Formula One team chief Frank Williams, technical director
Patrick Head, designer Patrick Newey, race director Roland
Bruynseraede and Imola track officials Federico Bendinelli and
Giorgio Poggi all deny charges of manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Newey and Bruynseraede had argued when the trial
opened last week that much of the case built up against their
clients over the past three years should be ignored because they
had not been warned they were under investigation.
</P>
<P>
Costanzo rejected the submissions as unfounded.
</P>
<P>
He also threw out a separate challenge on territorial
jurisdiction from Newey's counsel, which told the court on Friday
that the trial should be moved to the city of Bologna, where Senna
was declared dead in hospital.

<HEADLINE> Slovenia's Parliament Approves New Coalition Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Slovenia's parliament today
approved by a slender majority Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek's new
coalition government, ending a three-month-old crisis following
the country's November general elections last year.
</P>
<P>
The coalition government of the ex-ruling Liberal Democratic
Party (LDS) and ex-opposition Slovenia National Party (SLS) is
Slovenia's fourth government after its independence from former
Yugoslavia in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The LDS and the SLS shared 16 of the 17 ministerial posts in
the new government, with the last one going to the Democratic
Pensioner's Party.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the SLS Marjan Podobnik was named deputy prime
minister to be in charge of coordinations among ministries, while
former Foreign Minister Zoran Thaler retained his post.
</P>
<P>
Slovenia, a country of two million people lying between
Austria, Croatia and Italy, has been without a government since
elections on November 10, 1996, because no party won an absolute
majority.
</P>
<P>
Drnovsek, head of the LDS, failed in his first attempt to form
a government when his proposed ministerial list was rejected by
the parliament on February 6.

<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- No attempt to divide China
will succeed, a spokesman for the Taiwan affairs offices of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State
Council commented here today on the Dalai Lama's plan to visit
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"Both Taiwan and Tibet are inseparable territories of China,"
the spokesmen said. "It is known to all that the Dalai clique has
long been engaged in activities to split the motherland and openly
preached 'Tibet Independence' in the international community."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that the Taiwan authorities' open
invitation to the Dalai Lama to visit Taiwan fully demonstrates
the fact that the Taiwan authorities and the Dalai clique are
openly colluding with and taking advantage of each other and going
further along the road of splitting the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"The Communist Party of China, and the Chinese government and
people are unswervingly determined to safeguard state sovereignty
and territorial integrity," the spokesman said, adding, "They
firmly hold on to national unity and freedom of religious belief,
and will never allow any attempt to split the motherland to
succeed."

<HEADLINE> Israeli Forces Bombard South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli occupation forces
escalated daily bombardments at suspected targets in south
Lebanon this morning in a retaliation for a pre-dawn
guerrilla operation in Israel's buffer zone causing casualties
to the Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
Radio Israel confirmed that one Israeli soldier was killed and
three others wounded in the guerrilla attack at the western
sector of the border strip early this morning.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said that Israeli artillery fired more than
100 shells at a number of targets in the areas of Nabatiyeh and
Iglim Al-Toffah in five hours.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese villagers escaping from the areas said that they
heard powerful explosions of bombardment since 5:30 a.m. (0330
GMT).
</P>
<P>
They said that the Israeli forces fired artilleries at
vicinities of a number of villages, and at least one house
at Bayad, Nabatiyeh, was seriously damaged.
</P>
<P>
Israeli jet fighters also carried our an air raid at
targets near the village of Habboush and fired air-to-surface
missiles and machine guns, and Israeli military helicopters hovered
at low altitude over the areas.
</P>
<P>
No civilian casualties in the Israeli bombardment were
reported.
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God,
launched a series of attacks at Israeli positions at Dabsheh,
Asshoura, Ali Dahir and Seweida this morning.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Beirut, the Islamic Resistance,
the military wing of Hezbollah, said that the guerrillas used
rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns in the attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance announced earlier that its militants
destroyed an Israeli Merkava tank in an ambush near the
Israeli position of Dabsheh, killing and wounding all the
Israeli soldiers inside.
</P>
<P>
Hit-and-run attacks by Muslim guerrillas and bombardments by
Israeli forces constitute a daily scene in south Lebanon, the
last active battlefront of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,100-square-kilometer "security zone"
in south Lebanon in 1985 as a buffer zone to protect northern
Israel from cross-border attacks.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Total deposits in Hong Kong
rose by 1.4 percent in January 1997, reversing the fall of 1.1
percent in December 1996, according to the statistics released by
the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) here today.
</P>
<P>
The increase resulted from increases in both HK dollar and
foreign currency deposits of 2.2 and 0.3 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
An HKMA spokesman said that total loans and advances rose
slightly by 0.1 percent in January, following a fall of 0.2
percent in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
He said that domestic credit rose by 3.8 percent, contributed
by a 0.2 percent increase in loans for trade financing and a 4.2
percent increase in other loans for use in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Analyzed by currency, HK dollar loans rose by five percent while
foreign currency loans fell by 2.7 percent during the month. As
the increase in HK dollar loans was larger than that of HK dollar
deposits, the HK dollar loan-to-deposit ratio rose to 106.1
percent at the end of January 1997 from 103.3 percent at the end
of December 1996.

HONG KONG, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The value of total retail
sales in December 1996 increased by eight percent to 22 billion HK
dollars (2.83 billion US dollars) over the same month in 1995,
according to the Census and Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
For 1996 as a whole, total retail sales rose by six percent in
value and two percent in volume when compared with 1995.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the department said today that the figures
reflected gradual pick-up in consumer spending in 1996, from the
increase of five percent in value and decline of one percent in
volume in 1995.
</P>
<P>
He said that compared with a year ago, the increase in December
1996 was mainly attributed to the significant surge in sales of
motor vehicles, and jewelry, watches and clocks and valuable
gifts.
</P>
<P>
He said that for 1996 as a whole, total retail sales improved
both in value and volume terms. Sales of most commodities
registered increases by various degrees in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu to Visit Cairo Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu will visit Egypt Tuesday to discuss with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak the future of the Mideast peace process,
the Egyptian MENA news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Their talks will deal with the peace prospects in the region
in the light of the worsening conditions due to the recent
Israeli decision to build new Jewish settlements in east
Jerusalem which has sparked fear of flare-ups of violence.
</P>
<P>
It will be Netanyahu's first tour to Egypt since he visited the
country last June after taking office.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president said Thursday he will discuss with
Netanyahu the Israeli decision on the new housing project in east
Jerusalem, which has ignited Palestinian demonstrations as well
as fierce criticism from the United States, Arab and European
countries.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Ministerial Committee on Jerusalem Affairs Wednesday
approved the construction of 6,500 housing units for the Jewish
settlers in Har Homa of east Jerusalem, an area taken by Israel in
the 1967 Mideast War. The committee also allowed another 3,015
homes to be built for Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Instead of imposing a status quo (on East Jerusalem), Israel
should resort to negotiations and take into consideration of the
public opinion before taking a decision, Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu had defended the project as a move to alleviate a
housing shortage for the Jews and Arabs in the city.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said that he informed Netanyahu over a phone call
Wednesday of his fear of a flare-up of violence because of the
Israeli construction plan in east Jerusalem, which the
Palestinians want it as the capital of a future Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
The Mubarak-Netanyahu meeting comes before Mubarak's March 10
trip to Washington, which would deal with the Mideast peace and
other pending problems, especially Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Developing Sino-US Relations Benefits World Peace: FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Developing Sino-US relations
is not only in the interests of the people of the two countries,
but is also helpful for promoting peace, stability and prosperity
in the Asia-Pacific region, and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang made this
statement here today, to mark the 25th anniversary of the issuing
of the Shanghai Communique signed by China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Shanghai Communique, issued during US
President Richard Nixon's visit to China in 1972, defined the
principles guiding bilateral relations, which were further
elaborated in the Joint Communique on the Establishment of Sino-US
Diplomatic Relations and the Sino-US Joint Communique on US Arms
Sales to Taiwan afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral ties in general have been continuously improved and
developed in the past 25 years on the basis of the principles set
out in the three Sino-US joint communiques, although they have
seen ups and downs over this period, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"The development of bilateral relations not only brought great,
practical benefits to the two peoples, but also is conducive to
promoting world peace, stability and prosperity," Tang
said. "There currently exist opportunities for the further
improvement and development of bilateral relations, 25 years after
the issuing of the Shanghai Communique," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the two sides will proceed from the overall
situation of world peace and prosperity, and the basic interests
of the two peoples, and make joint efforts to push bilateral
relations along the path of sound and stable development, based on
the three Sino-US joint communiques," he said.

<HEADLINE> HK Ranks 4th in World Overseas Investment List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong ranks the 4th
largest source of overseas investments in the world with 25
billion US dollars outward investments, the local English
newspaper Hongkong Standard reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper's report was based on a study of 1995 global
investment data conducted by the United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD).
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong follows the United States, Britain and Germany in the
 overseas investment rankings.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong-based Jardine Fleming Holdings spokesman David
Dodwell said that a large portion of Hong Kong's outward
investments went into inland areas where there were about 110,000
HK-funded joint ventures which had attracted large amounts of
foreign investments in the past 12 to 13 years.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong was also increasingly becoming an important center
for the financing and organizing of capital-intensive regional
infrastructure projects such as ports, highways, bridges and power
 plants, said Dodwell, a former UNCTAD researcher.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong offers a combination of first-class
engineering skills here, a big property and construction industry
and a very large financial services industry that can package the
financing.
</P>
<P>
He said that the territory's status as an international
financial center and as a center for packaging regional
infrastructure projects had led to the ranking.

<HEADLINE> Baseball, Soccer Players to Be Investigated for Tax Evasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Japanese tax authorities raided
the office and home of a business consultant on suspicion of
helping dozens of professional baseball and soccer players evade
income taxes, local reports said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The authorities also questioned some of the players who are
suspected of evading taxes under the instruction of the
consultant, based in the central Japan city of Nagoya.
</P>
<P>
The baseball players suspected of being involved are from 10 of
Japan's 12 professional teams, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Most of those suspected of improperly reporting their income
are star players who earn about 100 million yen (830,000
U.S. dollars) a year, and rookies who landed fat contracts when
they joined, the Asahi Shimbun reported.
</P>
<P>
Professional sport players are classified as self-employed, and
can claim as tax deductions money spent on equipment, commuting
and other goods and services considered necessary to their
profession.
</P>
<P>
The Asahi said the consultant, who was not identified,
allegedly had players falsely report they made payments ranging
from 10 million to 50 million yen to him for consultations, so
they could avoid paying tax on that money.

CANBERRA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister
John Howard today asked the unemployed and small businesses to be
patient and wait for the federal government's economic policy to
take full effect.
</P>
<P>
Howard said over ABC Radio (Australian Broadcasting
Corporation) that the government's industrial relations reforms
would help tackle the problem of unemployment, but the laws did
not come into full effect until mid-March.
</P>
<P>
However, the prime minister refused to set a target for the
unemployment rate, which is as high as 8.6 percent now, by the
next election, saying "I am aiming to get it down as soon as
possible without any particular reference to the next election."
</P>
<P>
"We have to say, give a bit more time for those changes to
work. I promise the public that we're devoting all of our
energies. We're trying a whole lot of strategies to tackle the
problem of unemployment," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was not surprised at criticism from small
business, but the changes to capital gains tax and industrial
relations laws would help small business.
</P>
<P>
"Can I say to them, I understand your concerns. I know why you
are still unhappy. You have reason to be unhappy, but please be a
little patient," he added.

titled "Nigerian environment, current policies and direction",
which he delivered at a recent seminar in Abuja, capital of
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
He further noted that of the 15,000 enterprises, only 5,000
are registered, while the rest 10,000 are operating illegally
within residential premises in cities like Lagos, Kaduna, Kano,
Port Harcourt, Onitsha and Aba.
</P>
<P>
The official pointed out that waste products from textiles,
tannery and paints industries in some cities are discharged
directly into open drainages and river channels.
</P>
<P>
In parts of Lagos, Kano, Enugu and Port Harcourt, smoke from
factories often blocks sunlight for hours and reduces visibility
to less than 20 meters, he said.
</P>
<P>
Adegoroye estimated that at least 20 million gallons of waste
oil is discharged from mechanic workshops, industries, power
stations and commercial houses on a daily basis, thereby
contaminating the land and underground waters.
</P>
<P>
He also commended the federal government's efforts at
combating environment pollutions, including the setting aside of
two percent of the country's annual revenue for environment
protection.
</P>
<P>
The government has also make it compulsory for every new and
major project to carry out a feasibility study to determine its
impact on environment, the official added.

<P>
ANKARA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and Iran are suffering
setbacks in their bilateral relations as Ankara expelled a
senior Iranian diplomat Thursday and Iran may expel Turkish
diplomats in retaliation.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Turkish Foreign Ministry said that
it had summoned Saeede Zadeh, Iranian consul general in Erzurum,
eastern city of Turkey, declared him as persona non grata and
requested him to leave the country within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's decision has shown that tensions between Ankara and
Tehran are rising.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Foreign Ministry made the tough decision after
Zadeh, through a Turkish private news agency and some television
channels Wednesday, accused Turkish Deputy Chief of General Staff
Cevik Bir of making unfriendly speeches against Iran in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Bir called Iran a supporter of terrorism during a joint
U.S.-Turkish Council meeting in the United States.
</P>

Iran issued a protest Monday, saying that what Bir said was
irresponsible, unacceptable and similar to those by the U.S. and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Turkish official sources said that Iran may expel Turkish
Ambassador to Tehran Osman Koruturk and Consul General in Orumieh
Ufuk Ozsancak in retaliation to Turkey's attitude toward Iran.

<HEADLINE> Peace Monitoring in N. Iraq Urged to Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Amid increasing tension in
northern Iraq, western diplomats here have called for an urgent
deployment of the Peace Monitoring Force (PMF) along the
cease-fire line to prevent any possible armed clash.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Daily News today quoted the sources as
saying that the PMF, which is in Turkey now, will be provided
with necessary equipment, including radio and vehicles, to carry
out its mission.
</P>
<P>
This move came following a recent statement issued by the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), claiming that the Iraqi
government troops and the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) troops
led by Massoud Barzani are preparing for a new offensive.
</P>
<P>
The statement called on the international community,
especially the United States, Britain and Turkey, to prevent
"another onslaught by the combined Saddam-Barzani forces."
</P>
<P>
The PUK and KDP are both rival Iraqi Kurdish armed groups and
have been fighting each other for more than two years.
</P>
<P>
Northern Iraq has been controlled by Kurdish rebels since the
1991 gulf war, but it split into rival zones in the PUK-KDP
conflict in 1994.
</P>
<P>
A glimmer of hope was expected for one time when the PUK and
KDP signed a peace deal on October 31, 1996 under the mediation
of the United States, Britain and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
According to the accord, both groups agreed to withdraw
their troops from the disputed areas along the cease-fire line
and take all necessary measures to provide security for the
members of the planned PMF.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq-backed KDP launched an attack on the Iran-backed PUK
in August last year and captured most of the northern part of
Iraq, which led to U.S. air strike against Iraqi military
targets.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Meets With Turkish Army Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Israel was seeking common
ground against "extremist elements" with Turkey, by using the
opportunity of the visit by the Turkish army chief, according to
a report of the state-run Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu met here Thursday
with Turkish Chief of Staff General Ismail Karadayi who is on his
first visit to the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
"We appreciate Turkey and its army and I believe our
cooperation is a very important component in securing the
aspiration for peace and stability in the Middle East, an area
that has many extremist elements," said a statement issued by the
Prime Minister's Office Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of "extremist elements," Netanyahu did not say whom
he referred to, according to the statement. But observers here
believe Turkish separatists are included.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey and Israel have a joint interest in securing
stability, peace and moderation in our region," the statement
quoted Netanyahu as saying.
</P>
<P>
In response, Karadayi said the relations between Turkey and
Israel "have always been good and will be even better in the
future."
</P>
<P>
He said that "there are excellent relations between our
armies and our military industries and this visit left me with a
very good impression."
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai also met with
Karadayi during his three-day visit at the invitation of Chief
of General Staff Lt.-Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak.
</P>
<P>
Karadayi's visit to Israel came a year after a tour by his
deputy, General Cevik Bir, who signed an agreement to hold joint
maneuvers and training exercises with the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Israeli pilots have subsequently been allowed to use Turkish
airspace for training, and Israel Aircraft Industries is to
upgrade 54 Turkish F-4 fighters in a deal worth 640 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Israel attaches great importance to strengthening its ties
with Turkey, an Islamic nation in the region and also a member
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been fighting a bitter war against Kurdish
separatists of the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK). But Israel is
very careful not to get openly involved in the Turkish internal
affairs.

<HEADLINE> 56 Die in Fight for Pasture Between Kenyans, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 28 (Xinhua) -- More than 50 raiders of
Uganda and six herdsmen of Kenya were killed on Tuesday evening
during fighting for grazing rights inside Uganda, the Daily
Nation reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the Kenyan General Service Unit and the
Administration Police had deployed forces at the border to
preserve peace following the incident.
</P>
<P>
The herdsmen in West Pokot District of Kenya had trekked to
the Chekarani area of Uganda to graze their animals in
accordance with an agreement between Ugandan and Kenyan
administrators, the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
The agreement allows Kenyan herdsmen to graze their animals on
the other side of the border in case of a persistent drought on
the Kenyan side, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The incident forced the Kenyan herdsmen to return with more
than 2,000 assorted animals to the Kenyan side of the border.
</P>
<P>
The pastoral communities in the border areas of the two countries
have traditionally engaged in cattle rustling across the Kenyan
and Ugandan borders.
</P>
<P>
Late last year, Kenya and Uganda agreed to establish a
regional peace secretariat to ensure that any community which had
lost its animals was compensated and severe punishment was meted
on the raiders.
</P>
<P>
On February 15, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi promised that
his government would do everything to eradicate rustling and
ordered a major cattle branding exercise for easy identification
of stolen animals.

<HEADLINE> Small Towns Become Economic Giants in East China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rapid expansion of small towns has not only promoted rural
industrialization, but also helped solve the problem of surplus
labor. The aggregate population of these small towns has reached
more than 14 million, accounting for one third of the province's
total, according to statistics, and the number of farmers who work
for township enterprises there is more than 60 percent of the
province's total working in township enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Chai said that Zhejiang is making progress in its rural
urbanization, which is also in response to the national endeavor
to "strictly control the size of large cities, moderately develop
medium-sized and small cities, and actively develop small towns."
</P>
<P>
The province is performing reform tests on 46 selected towns,
with the aim of summing up experiences to design a management
system and operation mechanism that caters to the socialist market
economy, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The efforts involve everything from household registration to
land transfers, grain sales, and social security.
</P>
<P>
In doing so, the provincial government expects small towns to
grow into development centers for second and tertiary industries,
processing and marketing centers for agricultural and sideline
products, and bases to promote rural culture, education, science
and technology, as well as exchange or service centers for rural
labor, information, skilled workers, and finance.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang is expected to build one hundred small modern towns by
the turn of the century, while some bigger towns will be developed
into small and medium-sized cities, according to Chai.

HANGZHOU, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Longgang was a dilapidated
fishing village a dozen years ago but now presents an image of a
modern "mini-city", with 20-storey buildings, sidewalk, lawns,
neon lights advertising everything in the downtown area, and more.
</P>
<P>
Located in eastern Zhejiang Province, it is the first small
town in China to be built by farmers' money, and has become a
model of urbanization for China's rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang now has 965 towns, a sharp rise from the 167 in 1978,
about the time China started its reforms and open-up policy.
</P>
<P>
Huang Zongke, the head of the town government, said that
Longgang has become a regional economic center, with last year's
industrial output value accounting for 40 percent of the county's
total. Wenzhou, whose jurisdiction Longgang falls under, has 30
economically-advantaged towns that contributed more than 60
percent of both the city's total industrial output and revenues in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
"Small towns are now an important revenue generator in the
rural economy of our province," Chai Songyue, vice governor of
Zhejiang, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The towns are home to most of the area's rural businesses and
represent three fourths of Zhejiang's economy at present.
According to Chai, township enterprises are playing a leading role
in terms of enterprise development, quality, and science and
technology development in the province's rural economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
has reiterated that NATO expansion should proceed with the
participation of Ukraine and Russia, the Interfax News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma, who was on vacation in the western Ukrainian city of
Lviv, made the remarks at a press conference on Wednesday after a
meeting with visiting Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine does not allow that the eastern expansion of the
western military alliance places Ukraine in a "grey area" of
security in eastern Europe, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Unlike Moscow, Kiev does not oppose NATO's expansion plan,
which is expected to admit ex-Warsaw Pact countries, but it calls
for a nuclear-free zone in central and eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
NATO should sign an accord with Russia and Ukraine to avoid
creating such a "grey area," Kuchma said.
</P>
<P>
Italy and Ukraine hold similar views on the issues of bilateral
relationship and European security, Kuchma told the press.
</P>
<P>
Prodi, who came here four months after Italian President Oscar
Scalfaro's Ukraine tour, said both sides advocate closer
cooperation in the European institution.

<HEADLINE> More Overseas Funds for China's Building Materials Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- China has introduced five
billion US dollars in overseas funds into its building materials
industry and is trying to attract even more to widen the scale.
</P>
<P>
The funds will be used to produce new building materials,
inorganic nonmetallic materials, and equipment to manufacture
building materials, according to a senior official with the State
Administration of Building Materials, which is asking overseas
enterprises involved to strictly abide by Chinese laws and rules
and to answer industry needs and to provide advice.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that the use of overseas funds should take
the industry's product mix restructuring into consideration as
well as environmental protection. All overseas-funded projects
must meet international standards for environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Overseas funds will be introduced mainly for production of
cement, glass and ceramics. The country is encouraging
construction of large cement projects and technology upgrading in
small cement plants. In ceramic production, focus will be placed
on improving product quality.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration of Building Materials will also put
limits on overseas-funded enterprises, and will not allow
exclusively foreign-owned cement and glass enterprises. Co-funded
technological transformations or share-holding by foreigners in
key state-owned enterprises, whose products are listed in the
country's production plans, will be allowed only with approval
from government departments.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, overseas-funded projects should pay attention to
technical upgrading. China particularly encourages establishment
of research and development centers for glass fibre reinforced
plastic, and other new building materials, for sustained
development of related technology.
</P>
<P>
The administration says that production equipment in
overseas-funded cement, glass, and ceramics enterprises should be
purchased through domestic and international bidding and at least
50 percent of the the equipment should be domestic.

HEFEI, February 28 (Xinhua) -- A group of officials involved in
economic crimes, who were known as the "greedy rats" locally, were
punished last year in East China's Anhui province.
</P>
<P>
The province cracked 2,666 cases involving economic crimes in
1996, up 7.6 percent compared to 1995, and legal punishments were
meted out to 66 local officials.
</P>
<P>
Local sources reported that 1,830 were cases involving at least
10,000 yuan, and 26 involved 500,000 yuan in embezzlement or
bribes.

figure being 59.3 percent more than that in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Among the criminals, 261 people reportedly worked in Party and
government organizations, administrative management institutions,
economic management departments and judicial departments, as well
as 1,336 in state-owned companies.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Suggest Proper Legislation for Clone Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
suggested that legislation is necessary for control of potential
dangers that may arise from the clone technology.
</P>
<P>
Attending the annual sessions of China's parliament and its top
government advisory body here, the scientists agree that the birth
of the first clone sheep announced earlier this week is a major
scientific breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, scientists in Scotland announced that they had
produced the world's first clone animal from the combination of a
cell nucleus from an adult sheep's mammary gland and an
unfertilized egg from another ewe.
</P>
<P>
Comparing it with that of nuclear energy, genetiist Zhang
Jiaming said that clone technology can be used to both
benefit and harm the human race.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, a deputy to the National People's Congress (NPC), heads
a research institute of biological products under the Ministry
of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
Zhang and his colleagues suggested that laws be enacted to
control the use of clone technology within a limited scope. They
agree that the technology should be off-limit for the
duplication of human beings.
</P>
<P>
However, the scientists said there is no need for panic since
the technology has only made initial progress.
</P>
<P>
According to clone theories, a human being's cells do not die
with him or her. The clone technology may enable scientists to
duplicate the DNAs contained in any cell and develop it into an
identical person with the deceased one.
</P>
<P>
The cloning of the sheep was regarded by some as the prelude to
the technical duplication of human beings, and unsurprisingly, it
worries some scientists, ethicists, and government officials for
its complex ethical implications.
</P>
<P>
Chen Shouyi, head of the Institute of Genetics under the
Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), said the sheep cloning
technology will help with efforts to maintain purebred sheep,
and it should not be stopped simply because of some potential
dangers it may present.
</P>
<P>
Chen, a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference National Committee, used to be a member of a research
team which cloned a cow from embryonic cells last April. However,
the Scottish team was the first to make a clone from adult animal
cell.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Capital Needs Money to Reconstruct Roads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian capital of Lusaka
needs 80 billion Kwacha (about 62 million US Dollars) to
reconstruct its roads.
</P>
<P>
''The whole road network in Lusaka needs reconstruction
because about 90 percent have reached their 20-year life span, ''
Lusaka Mayor Fisho Mwale was quoted by today's Times of Zambia as
saying on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The mayor said the city council could not fund the road
reconstruction since it has only been allocated 300 million
Kwacha (about 230,000 Dollars) for the project.
</P>
<P>
The money allocated to the council in this year's budget will not
make a significant impact on the state of roads in the city as it
could only cater for as short as five kilometres of road, he said.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 more dollars are needed to construct the
drainage systems and unblock those which have been clogged over
the last 10 years due to the accumulation of silt and garbage,
Fisho Mwale said.
</P>
<P>
President Frederick Chiluba last week was dismayed at the
state of the roads in the city during an inspect tour. enditem

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Suggest Proper Legislation for Clone Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
suggested that legislation is necessary for control of potential
dangers that may arise from the clone technology.
</P>
<P>
Attending the annual sessions of China's parliament and its top
government advisory body here, the scientists agree that the birth of the
first clone sheep announced earlier this week is a major
scientific breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, scientists in Scotland announced that they had
produced the world's first clone animal from the combination of a
cellnucleus fro an adult sheep's mammary gland and an
unfertilized egg from the same sheep.
</P>
<P>
Comparing it with that of nuclear energy, genetiist Zhang
Jiaming said that clone technology can be used to both
benefit and harm the human race.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, a deputy to the National People's Congress (NPC), heads
a research institute of biological products under the Ministry
of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
Zhang and his colleagues suggested that laws be enacted to
control the use of clone technology within a limited scope. They
agree that the technology should be off-limit for the
duplication of human beings.
</P>
<P>
However, the scientists said there is no need for panic since
the technology has only made initial progress.
</P>
<P>
According to clone theories, a human being's cells do not die
with him or her. The clone technology may enable scientists to
duplicate the DNAs contained in any cell and develop it into an
identical person with the deceased one.
</P>
<P>
The cloning of the sheep was regarded by some as the prelude to
the technical duplication of human beings, and unsurprisingly, it
worries some scientists, ethicists, and government officials for
its complex ethical implications.
</P>
<P>
Chen Shouyi, head of the Institute of Genetics under the
Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), said the sheep cloning
technology will help with efforts to maintain purebred sheep,
and it should not be stopped simply because of some potential
dangers it may present.
</P>
<P>
Chen, a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference National Committee, used to be a member of a research
team which cloned a cow from embryonic cells last April. However,
the Scottish team was the first to make a clone from adult animal
cell.

<HEADLINE> Rolled Steel Market in China in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- China's rolled steel
consumption this year is estimated at a record more than 100
million tons, with the growth rate higher than that in the
previous year, "China Materials News" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the country's rolled steel output this year
is expected to rise to 88.5 million tons, so about 10 million tons
of imports will help meet the domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Compared with foreign sluggish rolled steel markets, China's
rolled steel market, the world's largest, has been facing keen
competition as a result of the large amount of imports.
</P>
<P>
The country's iron and steel enterprises are still under great
pressure from international competition this year, the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
China's present annual rolled steel production capacity has
surpassed 100 million tons, which is expected to fulfill domestic
needs for common products, except for certain varieties.
</P>
<P>
The development of China's demand for rolled steel has a
different periodic fluctuation from the international one, but
overseas market fluctuation will have a growing influence on the
domestic one, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
This year China's rolled steel market is expected to recover
from its sluggish state during the 1994-1996 period, and reach its
summit next year, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
This year some of China's economic policies, such as making its
building industry a pillar sector, are expected to promote the
development of the country's steel industry by raising the
domestic demand for rolled steel.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- A development plan for

military and civil operations has been worked out.
</P>
<P>
The plan, jointly drawn up by the State Council, the Ministry

Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), is aimed at establishing a
human resources training system suitable both for the development
of the socialist market economy and the building up of the PLA.
</P>
<P>
It is to set up training schools for ex-servicemen across the
country to help them with reemployment after they are demobilized.
</P>
<P>
It asks the country's professional education organizations to
mobilize all social forces to support the training work.
</P>
<P>
The training of military personnel for civilian occupations
began in 1977, and more than 3.2 million ex-servicemen have been
re-employed since then.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria to Raise Prices of Electricity, Communications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The prices of electricity and
phone calls in Bulgaria will soar again next month.
</P>
<P>
Electricity will be sold at 36 leva (about two US cents) per
kilowatt-hour as of March 1 and the price will shortly rise again
to 3.5 US cents per kwh, the government said. Phone call charges
will rise from 0.18 cents to 1.2 cents for a local call and prices
for long distance and international calls will also go up.
</P>
<P>
Energy prices rose by 400 percent last year after three lots of
price hikes imposed by the government. The latest round of
increases were due to come into force on February 1 but were
delayed.
</P>
<P>
The government said electricity subisidies worth 20 million
Ecus (23 million U.S. dollars) offered by the European Union will
be available to the 150,000 poorest families.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria is facing a serious crisis caused by several years of
mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist government resigned earlier this month under
pressure from the opposition for failing to deal with the
country's growing economic problems. A caretaker government was
formed on February 12 to manage the country until general
elections are held in April.

<P>
Rodman said he had never contacted his father for 30 years,

<HEADLINE> NPC Spokesman on Election of HK Deputies to Ninth NPC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will elect 36
deputies to the Ninth National People's Congress, China's
legislature, a NPC spokesman said in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
At the first press conference of the Fifth Session of the
Eighth NPC, which is due tomorrow, Zhou Jue, spokesman for the
session, said that the method for the election of Hong Kong
deputies to the next NPC will be discussed and decided during the
session.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with a draft method deliberated by the 23rd
Session of the Eighth NPC Standing Committee at the end of last
year, he said, a meeting of election will be established, which
will be composed of members of the Selection Committee for
choosing the first government of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) who are citizens of Chinese
nationality.
</P>
<P>
The number of the deputies is decided according to the Election
Law of the NPC, which stipulates that one NPC deputy will be
chosen from every 220,000 urban residents.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that even if it is passed by the current NPC
session, the method is still a transitional one that will be
applied to the Ninth NPC only.
</P>
<P>
The term of the current NPC will expire in March of 1998, while
deputies to the Ninth NPC should be elected before the end of
January, 1998.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question from a Hong Kong reporter on whether
the principles of "one country, two systems" and "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong" will be fully implemented after the passing
of Deng Xiaoping, Zhou said it is the Chinese government's
consistent stance to carry out these principles unswervingly, and
there is no possibility of any change.
</P>
<P>
He said it was the long-cherished aspiration of Deng Xiaoping
to achieve the return of Hong Kong to the motherland with the
principles of "one country, two systems" and "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
"The great concept of 'one country, two systems' set forth by
Deng Xiaoping has found repeated expressions in laws adopted by
the NPC and various documents released by the central government,
and it is now deeply rooted in the minds of the people," he added.
</P>
<P>
A "New York Times" correspondent asked if the current NPC
session will deliberate on China's signing of two United Nations
covenants on economic, social and cultural rights and on civil and
political rights.
</P>
<P>
"It is not on the agenda of the current session. However, the
relevant departments of the Chinese government are giving
considerations to this matter," Zhou said.

<P>
BANGKOK, February 28 (Xinhua) -- A Thai private sector joint
committee has urged all government bodies to work together in a
bid to manage the economy effectively.
</P>
<P>
In a communique, available here today, the committee said
urgent actions must be taken to restore Thailand's competitive
edge.
</P>
<P>
The private sector committee, comprising representatives of the
Chamber of Commerce, the Federation of Thai Industries and the
Thai Bankers' Association, noted that the drive to improve export
performance must continue and recommended that the government cut
operating cost, reduce bureaucratic red tape and offer value-added
tax refunds more quickly.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the private sector is willing to make
sacrifice in the short term for longer term gains.
</P>
<P>
The committee said it would work with state enterprises and
related trade associations to promote the tourism, hotel, textiles
and garments, gems and jewelry, electrical appliances, and
handicraft sectors.

proclaiming that the worst is over.

exports were up 1.2 percent from the previous month, compared with
the 0.2 percent negative growth for the whole 1996.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Announces Month-long Agitation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The main opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) has announced a month long program of mass
contacts, meetings and processions in addition to its March 3
anti-government agitation in district headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by BNP Secretary General Abdul Mannan
Bhuiyan on Thursday, a day after BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia had
threatened to launch a movement aiming to dislodge the
eight-month-old government.
</P>
<P>
While announcing this first kind of large-scale agitation
program since the defeat of the BNP on last June polls, the
secretary general also issued an ultimatum to the government to
meet its demands by March 30.
</P>
<P>
"If the demands are not met and the situation does not improve
by then, we will declare our next program on March 30," said
Bhuiyan.
</P>
<P>
Bhuiyan listed the demands including release of the BNP leaders
and workers from jail and withdrawal of "false" cases against
them, resignation of Chief Election Commissioner Abu Hena and
introduction of voters' ID card.
</P>
<P>
The programs are: countrywide mass-contact, meetings and
rallies from March 4 to 29, and meetings and processions in all
the district towns of the country on March 30.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina urged the
opposition to maintain peace and not to create "a situation that
will disturb the political stability and hamper foreign investment
in the country."

WARSAW, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Poland will provide Bulgaria
with 100,000 tons of grain to help the country overcome its food
shortage, Polish Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz said today.
</P>

During his visit, Stoyanov held talks with Polish President
Alexander Kwasniewski on their countries' bids to join the
European Union and NATO. They agreed to support each other on
these issues.
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski supported Stoyanov's idea that eastern European
countries should start negotiations on entry into the EU and
NATO at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov said Bulgaria's entry into NATO will not harm its
relations with Russia, which has always been opposed to NATO's
eastward expansion plan.

<HEADLINE> NPC Session Spokesman on Amendments to Criminal Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- An revision to China's
17-year-old Criminal Law in the upcoming Fifth Session of the
Eighth National People's Congress will be a major event in the
development of the country's legal and judicial system, a
spokesman for the NPC Session said today.
</P>
<P>
It would substantially help the country to achieve its goals of
effecting the practice of rule of law in China and improving its
legal framework, said Zhou Jue, spokesman for the NPC's Fifth
Session.
</P>
<P>
"However," he noted, "the principles and tasks of cracking down
on crimes, protecting the interests of people and safeguarding the
cause of socialism as provided in the existing law are correct and
will not be altered."
</P>
<P>
He explained that the sweeping amendments to be made to the law
are aimed to cope with the changes of the situation and the times.
For instance, computer crimes, money laundering and crimes related
to the value-added tax invoices emerging in recent years have to
be dealt with in the law, as well as the crimes of smuggling and
corruption, which are more severe today and must be given harsher
penalties or curbed through other ways.
</P>
<P>
As the most noteable changes in the draft criminal code, three
major principles of criminal justice will be further clarified.
Namely, crimes and penalties must be decided by the law, penalties
should comply with crimes, all people are equal before the law,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The analogy measures included in the existing law have been
annulled in the draft code to the NPC Session.
</P>
<P>
The new draft has set still more explicit terms on crimes and
penalties, which would effectively reduce wilful practices by law
enforcement personnel and protect the legitimate rights and
interests of individuals, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Another amendment was introduced to revise the definition of
the counter-revolutionary crimes and redefine them as offenses to
jeopardize state security, he added.
</P>
<P>
Stipulations on debatement from penalty, release on parole,
surrender and meritorious service by the convicted were also
improved and made more specific, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> US Treasury Urges Debt Payment to Finance Institutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- United States Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin today urged the Congress to pay the huge
debt the U.S. owes to the World Bank and regional development
banks.
</P>
<P>
Rubin asked a House panel to consider President Bill Clinton's
budget request for 1.6 billion U.S. dollars for international
financial institutions such as the World Bank, the International
Monetary Fund and the regional development banks.
</P>
<P>
Failure to pay the debts would jeopardize the U.S. leadership
of these financial institutions, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We make this budget request because it is in our economic and
national security interests and because we have to play our fair
part in budget sharing," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. was the world's largest and richest economic power, he
said: "Yet we are the largest debtor to the United Nations, the
only major country in arrears to the World Bank, and account for
the lion's share of arrears to the regional development banks."
</P>
<P>
In its budget plan for fiscal year 1998, the Clinton
administration had proposed spending on the international
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
To date, the U.S. owes 1.5 billion dollars to the World Bank
and the regional development banks.
</P>
<P>
The total debt the U.S. owes to the financial institutions
exceeds the debt it owes to the United Nations which is more than
one billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> NPC Spokesman on Political System Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua)-- One of the important contents
of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics is to go in for political reform along with
economic reform, said a spokesman for the current session of the
National People's Congress (NPC), China's legislative body, today.
</P>
<P>
"Deng Xiaoping has repeatedly mentioned reform on political
system in the third volume of his selected works," said Spokesman
Zhou Jue. "According to Deng's ideas, political reform is just
aimed to develop socialist democracy, improve socialist legal
system, keep invigorating the Party and government, get rid of
bureaucracy, and bring the initiatives of the people into full
play."
</P>
<P>
Under the guidance of this principle, he added, China's
political reform has made great progress over the past 18 years,
and China's construction of democracy and socialist legal system
have also made drastic improvements.
</P>
<P>
"These have provided a guarantee for China's reforms and
opening-up and socialist modernization drive," Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
However, China's political reform is not intended to copy the
multi-party or parliamentary systems of the Western nations, the
spokesman stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The General Council of the
Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia (RTUF) has
adopted a resolution to stage an all-Russia strike on March 27,
Itar-Tass news agency reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the RTUF press service, the strike was expected to
be joined by more than four million people from 26,000 work
places in the Russian Federation.
</P>
<P>
The General Council called on Russian President Boris Yeltsin
to sack the government for its failure to stop growing salary
arrears.
</P>
<P>
RTUF officials said that by the end of January, unpaid pay
totaled 9.4 trillion Roubles (1.66 billion U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Czech Assembly Approves Border Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The assembly of the Czech
Republic Wednesday approved, after a heated discussion, a border
accord with its former federation partner, the Slovak Republic.
</P>
<P>
The law was passed with 141 votes in favor, 37 objections and
14 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Czech Interior Minister Jan Ruml said later: "Czech and
Slovakia will be close neighbors forever, but the border for the
two sovereign states must be settled in a form of law."
</P>
<P>
The accord, agreed in January 1996 by both countries' interior
ministers and already approved by the Slovak parliament, would
have shortened the border by 33 km, to 252 km, straightening out
curves drawn after the split of Czechoslovakia in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The border trouble arose from a plan to exchange two villages,
the now Czech village of U Sabotu, and Slovak village of
Sidonie. This would have meant a shift of 452 hectares of land to
one or the other side at different places, allowing the border to
follow a more logical line.

<HEADLINE> Nepali PM to Reduce Cabinet Size After Confidence Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Sher
Bahadur Deuba has finally agreed to trim his 47-member coalition
cabinet after his main ruling party directed him to do so early
this month.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here Thursday, Deuba vowed to reduce the
cabinet size only after his three-party government obtains a vote
of confidence in the upcoming winter session of parliament
starting from next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He requested lawmakers of his Nepali Congress (NC) party and
other coalition partners to present themselves unitedly in the
parliament session and vote for the government.
</P>
<P>
Deuba is expected to seek a vote of confidence for his
government during the session under opposition pressure since it
was reduced into minority status by an opposition challenge last
December.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's statement was Deuba's first public response to his
party's call for a reduction of cabinet size made at a party
central committee meeting early this month.
</P>
<P>
The NC party leadership directed Deuba to trim his cabinet to
"polish the image of the government and to enhance its
effectiveness."
</P>
<P>
So far over two dozens of MPs of the NC party have threatened
to be absent from the parliament session if the prime minister
does not make the reshuffle before the session, local reports said
today.
</P>
<P>
They insisted that the cabinet should be reduced before the
government secures the vote of confidence in the lower house of
parliament.

<HEADLINE> Italy Reiterates Joining EMU on Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi reiterated today that Italy is on track to be part of
European Monetary Union from the start.
</P>
<P>
"Italy intends to present itself at the appointed time for
monetary union with all its papers in order so that we can be lead
players in all the next steps Europe will make," Prodi said during
a question and answer session in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said that heads of state and government of the 15
European Union nations would assess their own achievements in
January 1999, and then "decisions will be made jointly instead of
being made by those who consider themselves as having the
authority of a teacher marking his students."
</P>
<P>
This was believed to be a veiled reference to Germany, where
many economists and leaders have made it clear they don't want
Italy to be in the first wave of countries joining the single
currency because they think the weak lira would drag down the
currency.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said a Europe without Italy would not be
able to represent the full complex dimension of the continent and
would lose the ability to be coherent on the Mediterranean scene.
</P>
<P>
He also told the Senate that he had spoken earlier today to
French President Jacques Chirac on the phone, and both sides
reached "full consensus" on the common strategy of the Maastricht
Treaty for Mediterranean countries.
</P>
<P>
The ANSA news agency took the "full consensus" as referring to
issues in Europe, including the single currency and the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization's eastward expansion, and a signal of
"reconciliation" after Italy criticized France for conducting
nuclear tests and France accused Italy of devaluing the lira to
boost its competitiveness.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Albania's ruling Democratic
Party, on Thursday nominated incumbent President Sali Berisha as
its candidate for the March presidential election.
</P>
<P>
At a special meeting of the party's National Commission today,
85 out of the 90 members present approved the nomination with five
abstentions. Fourteen members were absent.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Committee of the party's National Commission
decided to nominate Berisha because he made great contributions to
the country's reforms and integration with Europe, a party senior
official said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Constitution of Albania, the president is elected by
the People's Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Berisha, who was elected president in April, 1992, will most
likely be re-elected because the ruling party enjoys a large
majority in the assembly.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy Seeks Leniency for Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- United States
Ambassador to Colombia Myles Frechette has asked the U.S. to give
a conditional certification on Colombia's drug combating efforts
if the Colombian Congress approves extradition legislation within
the next six months.
</P>
<P>
The "El Expectador" newspaper said today that Frechette's
request was sent last week to the U.S. Department of State. It
asked for the granting of conditional certification for national
security reasons, if the new law which also provides for stiffer
sentences for drug traffickers is approved.
</P>
<P>
The certification is an annual assessment in which Washington
examines the performance of 32 countries in combating drug
trafficking. The U.S. then decides to certify a list of countries
as cooperating fully with U.S. efforts to fight drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
United Statea Undersecretary of State Robert Gelbard had
received reports from U.S. departments, including the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), demanding
that Colombia be disqualified for the second time, due to
Colombian President Ernesto Samper's lack of collaboration in
fighting trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Frechette's report was the only one favoring
certification for Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Last year,the United States disqualified Afganistan, Burma,
Colombia, Iran, Nigeria and Syria.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will increase oil
exploration activities throughout the country, especially in its
eastern regions, local press quoting official sources reported
today.
</P>
<P>
State oil and gas company Pertamina is offering 27 areas for
oil and gas exploration, including 15 in eastern Indonesia, the
company's director for exploration and production Prijamgodo
Muljosudirdjo said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said 23 of the areas were being offered under the production
sharing contract (PSC) and four under the technical assistance
contract (TAC).
</P>
<P>
"Last year, oil contractors spent only 586.7 million US dollars
on exploration, this year they are committed to spending more than
one billion dollars," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said total spending by foreign oil contractors on
exploration, production development and administration would reach
5.34 billion dollars this year, up from 4.21 billion dollars last
year.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia produces around 1.5 million barrels of crude oil per
day, almost 70 percent of which is exported.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts have said that unless Indonesia steps up oil
exploration, it could turn from the region's main oil exporter
into a net oil importer by the turn of the century.

<P>
SOFIA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria has asked banks of the
Paris Club group of creditors to allow it to postpone the
repayment of 50 million U.S. dollars of foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
The request was made by Stefan Sofiianski, prime minister of
Bulgaria's caretaker government. He was appointed by President
Peter Stoyanov on February 12 after the resignation of the
Socialist government under pressure from the opposition for
failing to deal with the country's economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Sofiianski said that the move will not harm his country's
relations with its creditor banks.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria has so far signed three agreements with banks of the
Paris Club to postpone the repayment of 1.2 billion U.S. dollars
of loans.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria's external debt now amounts to more than 10 billion
dollars but the country's economic crisis has left it with only
300 million dollars in foreign reserves, and no money to pay back
the loans.

TEGUCIGALPA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Honduras is in the final
stages of preparing for the demaraction of its maritime boundary
with Nicaragua to solve a long-standing dispute over sea borders.
</P>
<P>
Talks will be held with Nicaragua to agree on the exact sites

<HEADLINE> Internet Narrows Gaps, Speeds Competition: Intel President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Internet will narrow gaps
between developing and developed nations and accelerate
competitiveness globally, Intel Corporation Chief Executive
Officer and President, Dr. Andrew Grove, told Xinhua in a recent
interview.
</P>
<P>
"The Internet has the power to level the playing field between
societies." Grove said, "Access to information allows the time
between decisions to decrease, which accelerates competitiveness
globally."
</P>
<P>
Giving his vision of the emerging "network society", the
central theme of the 1997 annual meeting of the Geneva-based World
Economic Forum, Grove said the network society was overwhelmingly
positive.
</P>
<P>
"For business and government it is a case of economic
competition and development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Data transference was still slow in the present Internet due to
slow or busy communications links. In the wake of that, Intel was
designing a Personal computer able to compensate for some of these
problems.
</P>
<P>
Intel, the world's largest semiconductor producer, introduced
its latest Pentium processors with multi-media chip technology in
early January. The new processors are said to be far better at
compressing and decompressing data, squeezing it down so that it
can fit into a smaller bandwidth connection.
</P>
<P>
Referring to China's computer technology, Grove said: "China is
leapfrogging ahead of many western countries." He was extremely
impressed with the speed with which China was moving into the
"Information Age".
</P>
<P>
Speaking about Intel's cooperation with China, the president
mentioned Intel's Computer Architecture Laboratory in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Intel was helping numerous Chinese software and hardware
developers to develop technology to make Internet access more
rewarding and enjoyable to Chinese speakers around the world, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian House Approves Budget But Calls for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's House of
Representatives approved the 1997-98 draft state budget without
any changes Thursday, but urged the government to boost tax
revenue and reduce current account deficit.
</P>
<P>
The house's four factions, which approved the budget at a
plenary session, also criticizing the government for increasing
civil servants', soldiers' and pensioners' salaries.
</P>
<P>
President Soeharto presented the country's 1997-98 budget draft
in January, with a total revenue expected to reach 101.1 trillion
rupiah (43.2 billion US dollars), or nominally up 11.6 percent on
the current budget.
</P>
<P>
Domestic revenues, which rely heavily on taxes, are expected to
exceed 64 trillion rupiah (27.35 billion dollars), an increase of
almost 16 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The four factions urged the government to further increase tax
revenue, especially from direct taxes (income and property taxes),
because the ratio of tax receipts against gross domestic product
(GDP) was the lowest in ASEAN (association of southeast Asian
nations) countries.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The factions also called for special attention to the worsening
balance of payments problem. The current account deficit is
projected to reach 9.8 billion US dollars in 1997-98 or almost 4
percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
The country's fiscal year starts on April 1 and ends on March
31 next year.

<HEADLINE> Producers Demand Protection Against U.S. Dumping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's industrial body, the
CNI, is calling on President Fernando Henrique Cardoso to impose
sanctions against a U.S. conglomerate it accuses of dumping its
products on the Brazilian market.
</P>
<P>
The National Industries Confederation has accused American
Natural Soda Ash of selling the raw material barrilla on the
Brazilian market at artificially low prices, threatening Brazil's
domestic producers.
</P>
<P>
Barrilla is a raw material used in the manufacture of more than
100 products, mainly glass, textiles, and detergent.
</P>
<P>
ANSAC is a U.S. cartel of barrilla exporters formed by
U.S. firms manufacturing the product, which is forbidden by the
U.S. Congress from operating domestically, a report by the CNI
said.
</P>
<P>
Its dumping activities have caused 23 companies worldwide to
close down.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has already banned ANSAC from operating in
Europe to protect its domestic producers, CNI president Fernando
Bezerra said.
</P>
<P>
The report called on the Brazilian government to raise tariffs
on barilla imports, provide compensation to domestic producers
and anti-dumping penalties on the company.

BANGKOK, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has applied to join
the Indian ocean rim consultative business network in a bid to
find new markets and sources of raw materials for domestic
production.
</P>
<P>
The move was taken after Thailand noted the great potential of

one-third of the world's population, Savaraj Sachchamarga, deputy
secretary-general of the Thai Chamber of Commerce was quoted today
by local press as saying.

MOSCOW, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Russia has refused to join a
NATO-sponsored military exercise in the Black Sea in August,
warning that the maneuver will further complicate the situation in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Andreyev told reporters
here today that Russia is clearly aware of the unspoken purpose
behind the exercise, but he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The exercise to be held in waters close to Yevpatoriya, a port

members -- the United States, Britain, Germany and Turkey -- along
with Ukraine, Bulgaria and Romania.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the exercise, which is being held under NATO's
Partnership for Peace program, is to assess the ability of fleets
from different countries to coordinate during joint military
action.

Russia has long been opposed to NATO's eastward expansion plan,

<HEADLINE> WHO Director-General: Severe Lack of Medicines in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The dire situation of Iraq's
health care system has prompted World Health Organization (WHO)
Director-General Hiroshi Nakajima to call on everyone involved in
the U.N.-Iraq "oil for food" deal to make sure the operation is a
success.
</P>
<P>
Nakajima, fresh from a four-day visit to Iraq, was shocked by
the near breakdown of Iraq's health care system, which he
described as "reeling under the pressure of being deprived of
medicine, other basic supplies and spare parts."
</P>
<P>
Nakajima went to the Gulf country on a fact-finding mission and
to observe the implementation of the United Nations Security
Council Resolution 986 authorizing the six-month sale of Iraqi oil
in return for the provision of food and medicines.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, a major oil-producing country, has been banned from
selling oil on the international market following its invasion of
Kuwait in August, 1990.
</P>
<P>
Nakajima said Iraq's "inability to cope with and provide
services which the Iraqi people used to receive is of grave
concern".
</P>
<P>
He noted that stocks of drugs and medical supplies in Iraqi
government drug warehouses and pharmacies were extremely
low. Basic medical materials, such as disposable syringes,
bandages and dressings are not available. Diseases that were
virtually under control are re-emerging.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Nakajima was told about the concerns of the
Iraqi government over delays in receiving medicine and medical
supplies, the WHO said.
</P>
<P>
In view of that, Nakajima urged all parties concerned to
"develop a spirit of closer cooperation in making this operation a
success, keeping in mind the urgent need to improve the health
conditions of the people of Iraq."

<P>
SHANGHAI, February 28 (Xinhua) -- China hopes to use 25 billion
US dollars-worth of overseas funds in its power sector in the
Ninth Five-Year-Plan period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
This means a doubling of the proportion of foreign investment
as compared with the country's total investment for the power
industry -- from 10 percent to 20 percent by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Shi Dazhen, minister of the power industry, who was here
recently for a national conference on the power industry, said
that pooling funds through various channels, including the
introduction of overseas funds, will remain a major task
challenging China's power industry.
</P>
<P>
According to him, China made actual use of 12.2 billion US
dollars in overseas funds for the construction of 75 large and
medium-sized power projects from 1979 to 1995, with a combined
generating capacity of 49.09 million kw, accounting for 10 percent
of the country's total investment in the power sector during the
same period.
</P>
<P>
China has worked out a series of detailed policies to encourage
overseas investors to invest in its power sector, which have
proved effective.

<HEADLINE> Shenyang To Clean Up Polluted Canal Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Foul water in a canal
surrounding Shenyang, the capital of Liaoning Province, is
expected to be cleaned up after 10 deputies to the fifth session
of the Eighth People's Congress asked about it on Tuesday, today's
"China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based newspaper also says that a survey in 1995
indicated the canal with two others around the city were heavily
polluted or even dried up from March to November every year
sending out awful smells. This is caused by cutting off the water
source from Dahoufang reservoir, an hour's drive away in the
northeastern suburb.
</P>
<P>
This reservoir was built in the 1950s. It has a capacity of
1.56 billion cubic metres, of which 14 million cubic metres of
water go into the canal for the city's environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
With the economic boom, the amount of water filling the lakes
through the canal has decreased considerably.
</P>
<P>
Ten deputies to the provincial People's Congress suggested
asking the local government to solve the problem. They got a
prompt response from the government. Xu Wencai, vice-governor in
charge of water's resources said that, a decision was made that
another 6 million cubic metres of water will be added to the city
for environmental purpose every year.
</P>
<P>
Xu also said more than 3.6 million US dollars was spent on a
dam to raise the level of the river so that water can be filled
into the Northern Canal.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning Province, an industrial hub with a poor water supply,
has resolved to spend an equivalent of 1.3 billion US dollars to
clear up Liaohe River, the province's main water source, by
setting up 21 water treatment plants in the next 15 years, the
paper says.

<HEADLINE> Animals in Shanghai Zoo Enjoy Winter Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 28 (Xinhua) -- All the animals in the
Shanghai Wildlife Zoo, the first of its kind in the country, have
been doing well since the beginning of this winter.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to good care by the zoo's staff, more than 5,000 wild
animals of 130 species have survived the winter, said Xia
Shuzhong, an employee with the breeding department.
</P>
<P>
About 30,000 sq m of grass and more than 50,000 trees and
flowers have been planted in the 300-million-yuan zoo since it
opened in Nanhui County, outside Shanghai in 1995, providing
better living conditions for the wildlife there.
</P>
<P>
Having enough food, the zoo's 16 Chinese alligators, a
hibernating animal, fell into a deep sleep in late autumn. They
were so absorbed in sleep that they did not wake up when the
workers moved them into insulated sheds. The spring will be here
soon, but they are still sound asleep.
</P>
<P>
Also with the habit of hibernating, black bears were more
active than the alligators during this mild winter. Not caged,
they can wander over large areas of the zoo.
</P>
<P>
The zoo has seen its population boom this winter, with more
than 50 animals of 16 species born, including four Northeast
tigers and 14 African lions.
</P>
<P>
Water birds, which were the "original residents" of the zoo,
brought their relatives and friends to nest on the zoo's lake
during the migrating season.
</P>
<P>
Two lion cubs, born on the first day of the Chinese lunar new
year, are the most popular "stars" in the zoo these days. The poor
cubs were abandoned by their mother as soon as they were born and
in badly need of milk. So the zoo workers had to advertise for a
"wet nurse" in a newspaper, and finally selected from among 50
candidates a dog named A Huang as the "honorary mother lion".
</P>
<P>
A Huang had produced seven puppies just the day after the lion
cubs were born and had no trouble feeding the cubs, as well as her
puppies, milk.

<HEADLINE> China to Adopt New Regulations on Consumer Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- China will adopt a new set of
regulations to deal with cases of infringement on consumer rights,
China Daily said today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile consumer protection will be given a high profile in
March when a special month-long publicity campaign is held to
inform the public of their legal rights.
</P>
<P>
The country plans the establishment of a nationwide social
supervision network to help protect consumers' legal rights and
create a fair consumer environment in China, the State
Administration for Industry and Commerce said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The administration is mobilizing over 30,000 local offices for
industry and commerce to improve investigations and the handling
of consumer infringement cases, said Gan Guoping, deputy director
of the administration.
</P>
<P>
"As part of the State administration's measures to protect
consumers, this effort will help broaden the official channels to
hear and accept consumer complaints in China," the paper quoted
Gan as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the State administration has designed March as a
special month to publicize the three-year-old law on consumer
protection. The promotion campaign will highlight legal rights set
by China's consumer laws, other relevant state and local
regulations, and the functions and roles and measures of the
administration in protecting consumers.
</P>
<P>
Gan said local administrations for industry and commerce will
co-ordinate with local People's Congress on the drafting of
relevant local rules.
</P>
<P>
"We aim to enhance public awareness about their own rights,
improve public understanding of the roles of administration
offices for industry and commerce and build a sound basis for the
establishment of the social supervision network for the protection
of consumers in China this year," said the official.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the administrations will strengthen supervision
and inspection of the implementation of the laws and regulations
on consumer protection.
</P>
<P>
They will also continue to conduct close-cooperation with
commodity inspection departments in the supervision and checking
of the quality of major imported commodities such as motorcycles,
TV sets, air-conditioners and cosmetics as a step to ban fake and
inferior imports and smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Chinese administrations for industry and commerce
investigated and dealt with almost 15,000 cases of consumers'
rights infringements.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang Province Successful in Protecting Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, February 28 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang
Province has made substantial achievements in protecting its
valuable cultivated land which had been decreasing for a long time
in the recent past due to industrial and urban expansions.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 the province newly cultivated 7,900 ha, compared with
7,700 ha which were occupied for non-farming purposes in the same
year. This enabled the province to achieve balanced land-use for
the first time, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
At present, the province has an average of a mere 0.036 ha of
cultivated land per person, which is less than half of the
country's average.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995), the
acreage of the province's farmland shrank by 21,300 ha every year.
</P>
<P>
As of 1995, the situation has been eased, thanks to the efforts
made by local governments, as the drop in the acreage of local
farmland was 31 percentage points less than the figure for the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Last year the province furthered the efforts to curb the
shrinking of farmland by 77.4 percent against the figure in 1995.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the provincial government issued three local laws
and regulations, while a responsibility system was established at
different levels of local government for protecting farmland.
</P>
<P>
Some local government officials have been punished for causing
farmland loss.
</P>
<P>
In the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), the provincial
government has ordered localities to open another 33,000 ha of new
cultivated land and upgrade 333,000 ha of low-yield farmland.

<HEADLINE> Moderate Growth for Workers' Wages in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The excessive growth of wages
in China slowed and the unemployment rate remained low in 1996.
</P>
<P>
China had 148.6 million salaried workers by the end of last
year, roughly same as in the previous year, according to a
national conference on labor and wages held in this, China's
largest industrial center recently.
</P>
<P>
The total amount of wages of workers across the country last
year was 912 billion yuan, 12.6 percent up from 1995. The earnings
of each worker averaged 6,210 yuan in 1996, 12.9 percent higher
than the figure in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
After deducting price rises, the wages increased by 3.8 percent
last year, the lowest rise since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Over 30 provinces and cities have implemented the minimum
cost-of-living system to guarantee the basic needs of the people
with financial difficulties in urban districts.
</P>
<P>
A breakthrough was made in many provinces in the reform of the
wages system last year, according to the conference.
</P>
<P>
The emphasis of the wage reform this year will be on three
aspects:
</P>
<P>
-- The relationship of distribution among different trades will
be readjusted in a bid to narrow the income gap;
</P>
<P>
-- The country will rectify the order of distribution and make
everyone have a clearer understanding of distribution principles;
and
</P>
<P>
-- Areas chosen for experimenting with wage reforms will be
expanded from Beijing, Shenzhen and Chengdu cities to 10 provinces
and cities.

Wei Xiangjie, the village's Communist Party secretary, told
Xinhua that Zhujiawan now has 286 households, with a total
population of 749.
</P>
<P>
According to Wei, the village began to move its population to
the new site in the second half of 1992, and by June 1993 all the
villagers had been resettled.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 the village generated a total industrial and
agricultural production value of 65.4 million yuan, compared with
20.71 million in 1993, while the villagers' per capita average
yearly income reached 5,880 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Wei attributed the achievements to the opportunities brought
about by the dam project-related resettlement, financial and
political assistance offered by the central government and other
parts of the country, and the wisdom of the villagers in grasping
the opportunities and working hard to enrich themselves.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Bin and his wife Tan Yulian said that their total income
was 21,000 yuan last year. Now the couple and their son are
leading a well-off life.
</P>
<P>
Yang Zhongfa, another Zhujiawan villager, works alone to
support his family, the poorest in the village, including his deaf
and dumb wife and his aged parents. With the help of the village
headquarters, the Yangs now have enough food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
Local government officials informed Xinhua that the village has
set a good example for other villages affected by the dam
project.

<P>
PARIS, February 27 (Xinhua) -- A Hall of Champions will be
unveiled in Paris in 1998 for the soccer's grestest players and
champions, sources from FIFA said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The complex, at a cost of 50 million US Dollars, will be housed
in an 8,500 square metre building, and comprises a multi-media
theatre, an exhibition hall and other zones featuring the
development of the sport.
</P>
<P>
To be built at Disneyland Paris, the project was under the
auspices of FIFA and International Sports and Entertainment
Concepts Incorporated of Atlanta, Georgia.
</P>
<P>
The Hall of Champions will feature a maximum of five players a
year as well as the greatest teams of all time.
</P>
<P>
In January, a panel of experts will vote for a special first
induction of 10 players who had a career of at least 10 years and
retired from the sport at least five years.
</P>
<P>
Among the obvious choices were Pele, Eusebio, Johan Cruyff,
Stanley Matthews, but Diego Maradona may be a topic of guessing.
</P>
<P>
Maradona who led Argentina to win the 1986 World Cup, had been
banned for 15 months after failing a dope test during the 1994
World Cup in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Hall is expected to open in the spring of 1998, shortly
before the start of the World Cup finals in France.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Residents of the Chinese
capital will soon be able to visit museums free of charge on
certain days, according to the Municipal Bureau of Cultural Relics.
</P>
<P>
About 30 museums directly under the administration of the
bureau have been ordered to open to the public without charging
fees on the first Sunday of each month from March 1, said Shan
Jixiang, director of the bureau.
</P>
<P>
"We made such a decision with the aim not only of helping
citizens gain more knowledge, but to mark the 20th International
Museum Day, which will fall on May 18 this year," Shan said.
</P>
<P>
The museums display objects and pictures demonstrating the
city's 1,000-year history, historical relics, and so on.
</P>
<P>
"This action is just an experiment. More museums will be
involved next year if the experiment is successful," said Xu Ming,
an official with the bureau.
</P>
<P>
Boasting rich resources of cultural relics and serving as
China's cultural center, Beijing has 94 museums of different
types, the biggest number of any part of the country.
</P>
<P>
The museums hold 400 exhibitions annually, receiving about 40
million visitors.
</P>
<P>
Since early last year the museums have started to reduce the
prices of admission or exempt admission for students and teachers
during weekends and holidays.

<HEADLINE> Multi-Billion Water Project Attracting Contractors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Engineering contractors from
14 countries are showing great interest in the construction of a
multi-billion water-diversion project in North China.
</P>
<P>
the Wanjiazhai water-diversion project is designed to channel
water from the upper reaches of the Yellow River to North China's
coal-rich province of Shanxi, which suffers from a severe shortage
of water.
</P>
<P>
The whole project will cost 20 billion yuan (about 2.41 billion
US dollars), of which the World Bank will provide 400 million US
dollars in the form of loans.
</P>
<P>
According to Zheng Yousan, general manager of the Wanjiazhai
Yellow River Water-Diversion Corporation of Shanxi Province, 14
companies have been accepted as qualified for public bidding,
during which participants will compete for the right to contract
construction of an underground pumping station and four tunnels.
</P>
<P>
The 14 companies are from Spain, Italy, Canada, New Zealand,
Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Brazil, Germany, France, Japan,
Mexico, the Republic of Korea and China.
</P>
<P>
On February 24 more than 100 businessmen representing the 14
companies arrived in Shuozhou, Shanxi, to attend a preparatory
meeting during which participants had chances to get to know more
about the bidding items.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that competing bidders are expected to finish and
hand in their bidding documents to a professional assessment
committee in charge of the public bidding for the water project
before the afternoon of April 4 this year, and the winners will be
announced soon after.
</P>
<P>
Construction is expected to begin in September this year.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, power-generating units will be
built in Wanjiazhai Village, Pianguan County, to divert water from
the Yellow River to Taiyuan, the provincial capital, and to
Shuozhou and Datong, two industrial cities in northern Shanxi.
</P>
<P>
The project will consist of two phases. In the first phase
water will be channeled from the Yellow River, which runs from
north to south in the western part of Shanxi, to Taiyuan. It is
expected to be finished by 2001.

<HEADLINE> Shandong Vows to Eliminate Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Shandong, a populous province in
east China, has vowed to eradicate poverty within two years.
</P>
<P>
This coastal province launched an anti-poverty program in
1984. By the end of last year the provincial government had
invested 1.2 billion yuan (about 145 million US dollars) in the
program.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the number of people living under the poverty
line, (with annual per capita income of no more than 530 yuan) was
reduced from 7.6 million in 1984 to last year's one million.
</P>
<P>
From this year the provincial government will increase its
annual allocation of funds for helping the poor from the previous
20 million yuan to 50 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Shandong plans to invest 300 million yuan in the 1997-1998
period to help people in poor counties on both sides of the Yellow
River and lakeside areas to move to better-off regions.
</P>
<P>
It has also speeded up the exploitation of natural resources in
the Yimeng mountainous area and around Dongping Lake. Government
planned investment in the development of the lake will reach 770
million yuan in the next four years. Some 37 villages in the lake
area and 630,000 people in the Yimeng area will benefit from the
two development projects.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the provincial government has worked out a series
of policies granting preferential treatment to poor counties such
as exemption of state grain quotas and agricultural tax.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Finds Ways to Help Poor College Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's colleges and
universities have been helping poor students to continue their
studies since China adopted a self-paying system for college
education.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Beijing Education Commission (BEC) show
that the city's 67 universities and colleges have about 13,000
poor students, or more than one tenth of the total college
students if the above-poverty income level is set at 120 yuan
(14.4 US dollars) per capita monthly in their families.
</P>
<P>
In some schools in the Chinese capital poor students account
for 30 percent of the enrollment.
</P>
<P>
The BEC has funneled an annual fund of 39.19 million yuan
(about 4.72 million US dollars) in recent years into schools by
offering scholarships for students who study and behave well, said
Gan Beilin, who is in charge of college students' guidance.
</P>
<P>
Recent years have seen nearly 98,000 scholarship winners, with
500 students obtaining four local particular study awards, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some 41 schools have set up student loans with a total fund of
12.88 million yuan, which has helped nearly 1,000 poor students
overcome financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Gan said that 9,000 part-time jobs have been provided for over
20,000 college students annually. Under this program, more than
3,000 poor students have managed to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the state has issued grant-in-aid worth 2.42
million yuan to needy students via schools in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Reduction of tuition fees has also helped poor students, Gan
added.
</P>
<P>
BEC officials, however, said that not all the city's higher
schools face the same problem. Some schools under the municipality
have fewer students who need aid, because most are Beijingers,
whose families have more income than other places in China.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some reputed schools, such as Qinghua, Beijing and
the People's University, have solved their problems concerning
needy students, thanks to more grants from society and the better
organizing of part-time jobs for the poor.
</P>
<P>
But students majoring in agriculture, geology, mining, Chinese
traditional medicine and teaching still face financial challenges.
</P>
<P>
The BEC will put aside a special fund and scholarships for poor
college students in 1997, when China will discontinue its
long-term system of state sponsorship for college students, Gan
said.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
on Thursday urged Somali factions to cooperate with regional peace
efforts and cease immediately all hostilities.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council reaffirms its commitment to a
comprehensive and lasting settlement of the situation in Somalia,"
said a presidential statement.
</P>
<P>
"It reiterates that full responsibility for achieving national
reconciliation and for restoring peace rests with the Somali
people," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi Mohamed, a clan leader from the northern half of the
divided capital of Mogadishu, and Hussein Aidid, who controls
parts of south Mogadishu, agreed in January to abide by a
cease-fire negotiated Oct. 15 in Nairobi. But fighting has
persisted, despite the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The council called upon Somali factions to ensure safety and
movement of aid workers and facilitate delivery of relief supplies
by opening Mogadishu's airport and harbor.
</P>
<P>
It also reiterated its call upon all states to fulfill their
obligation to implement the embargo imposed by resolution 733 on
all deliveries of weapons and military equipment to Somalia.

NEW YORK, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street slid
again today as bonds fell for the second straight session amid
growing worries about a potential interest rate hike next month.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 58.11 points to 6,925.07.
</P>
<P>
Decliners outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-4 margin on the New

<HEADLINE> French Auto Producer to Close Factory in Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 27 (Xinhua) -- France's auto producer Renault
will close in July its oldest overseas factory in Vilvorde,
Belgium, because of heavy budget deficit and fierce competition of
the European auto market.
</P>
<P>
The close of Vilvorde factory, which is located near Brussels
and was established in 1925, will cost Belgium 3,100 jobs and
immediately caused worry from French unions over more close-downs
of factories and mass lay-offs.
</P>
<P>
The closing of Vilvorde factory signals the beginning of a
restructuring program and a specialization plan of its factories
by Renault, whose budget has been in the red since 1995.
</P>
<P>
A Renault spokesman said today that the group, which will
announce soon a "very significant loss" of money in 1996, has to
"simplify and better use its industrial tool."
</P>
<P>
The fourth largest auto producer in Europe and with 46 percent
of its shares still being held by the French state, Renault has
been losing market over the past two years because of retardedness
in renovation of its range and high production costs.
</P>
<P>
Renault had to lower its automobile prices last September in
order to survive fierce competition from other European cars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, its leaders are trying to rationalize its production
apparatus in order to fully exploit its capacity by improving the
performances of its factories and lowering production costs.

<HEADLINE> UN Names New Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 27 (Xinhua) - Staffan de Mistura, a
national of Sweden and a veteran U.N. official for relief
assistance, was named on Thursday as the new coordinator for
humanitarian aid in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In announcing the appointment, U.N. spokesman Juan Carlos
Brandt said de Mistura is expected to take up his new post in the
next few days, replacing Gualtiero Gulcheri of Italy, who left
Baghdad on Monday.
</P>
<P>
De Mistura is to supervise the complex oil-for-food program
in Iraq that involves U.N. monitors checking on food, medicine and
other goods for the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, Iraq is permitted to sell $2 billion worth
of oil over six months to buy needed supplies for its people, who
have suffered under trade sanctions since August 1990.
</P>
<P>
Mr. de Mistura has had long experience in humanitarian work in
the U.N. system, serving with the U.N. Children's Fund, the World
Food Program, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization and the
U.N. Development program.
</P>
<P>
He was the chief U.N. humanitarian coordinator in northern Iraq
in June, 1991 and served in Somalia in 1992-1994, supervising all
U.N. humanitarian aid there.

<HEADLINE> Saudis Renews Cooperation Assurance in Bomb Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia reassured the
United States on Thursday that Riyadh will continue to cooperate
with Washington in the investigation into the June 25 truck
bombing, 1996, at the Khobar barracks in an air base near Dhahran,
that killed 19 U.S. servicemen.
</P>
<P>
The renewed pledge came from Saudi Deputy Prime Minister and
Defense Minister Prince Sultan when he held talks with Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright this morning.
</P>
<P>
"Prince Sultan and his associates pledged full cooperation by
the Saudi authorities with the FBI and other agencies of the U.S.
government," State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told a
regular news briefing. "We were very pleased to receive these
assurances, and we are counting on continued Saudi cooperation in
the future."
</P>
<P>
Prince Sultan has repeated his government's pledge to U.S.
leaders including President Bill Clinton and Defense Secretary
William Cohen when he discussed the issue with them during his
five-day visit to Washington, in a bid to alleviate U.S.
frustrations over what U.S. investigators there complained was
lack of information provided for them for the probe into who were
responsible for the bomb attack.
</P>
<P>
Burns said the United States expects the cooperation would
continue as Prince Sultan has assured in his "face-to-face"
meeting with U.S. leaders this week.
</P>
<P>
Burns revealed that Prince Sultan had discussed with Albright
about the Middle East peace negotiations, and the Clinton
administration was "very pleased to learn today that the Saudi
government intends to continue its large economic assistance to
the Palestinians in the West Bank."
</P>
<P>
Iraq was also a topic in Albright's talks with Prince Sultan
and "there was complete agreement between the Saudis and
Americans that we ought to continue to apply the sanctions on
Iraq,... until Iraq meets all of the relevant commitments under
all the relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions," Burns
said.

<HEADLINE> EU Investigates Companies Compromising Helms-Burton Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The European Union fears that
dozens of European companies are breaking EU laws and undermining
its effort to counter the U.S. Helms-Burton Act aimed at Cuba, it
was learned here today.
</P>
<P>
The dozens of companies, which are keeping the matter quiet,
are being investigated by the European Commission, the EU's
executive body, trade sources said in Brussels Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to an EU spokesman, the EU legislation to combat the
Helms sanctions "was law and had to be followed up." The
Commission has expressed its deep disappointment with the lack of
support it is getting from those companies in fighting
Helms-Burton.
</P>
<P>
Peter Guilford, spokesman for the EU trade commissioner, Sir
Leon Brittan, said that the anti-blocking legislation was a
powerful response to Helms-Burton, which has put companies in a
difficult position.
</P>
<P>
But he added, "In order to make it effective we have to dig."
The law was passed in October to combat the Helms-Burton Act,
which is aimed at further isolating the Cuban government of Fidel
Castro.
</P>
<P>
Under the Helms-Burton, naturalized Americans are entitled to
sue any foreign company or individual who have made profits out of
investments in property confiscated by the Cuban government after
the 1959 revolution.
</P>
<P>
By passing legislation to counter the act, the EU has made it
illegal for European companies to cooperate with any U.S.
investigation and to prevent companies from withdrawing from Cuba
due to a U.S. inquiry.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department has reportedly compiled a blacklist
of foreign companies that might be investing in such property.
Executives from the Italian telecom company STET, the Canadian
mining conglomerate Sherrit International and the Mexican telecom
company Grupo Domo have been barred from entering the U.S. because
of their links to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Washington declined to tell the number and the names of the
companies which it has put on its watch list, but it was reported
that the actual number was far more than the three, which were
identified in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Annan: UN Begins Distributing Food in Iraq March 1st </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Secretary
General Kofi Annan said here this evening that the United Nations
will begin distributing food in Iraq on March 1st, in application
of the "Oil for Food" plan it signed with Baghdad last May.
</P>
<P>
Following a three-hour meeting with French Prime Minister Alain
Juppe, Annan told the press that the preparations for food
distribution "are going on quite well," but he stressed that the
U.N. is following the situation of Iraq "very closely."
</P>
<P>
"We have talked about the efforts by the United Nations to
distribute humanitarian products, as well as this question of sale
of oil (by Iraq)... We will begin from March 1st," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations nominated Swedish Staffan de Mistura as U.N.
humanitarian coordinator in Iraq to be in charge of applying the
"Oil for Food" plan.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations said that de Mistura will arrive in Baghdad
in the coming days, while one third of the U.N. observers for the
application of the plan have arrived there.
</P>
<P>
The plan allows Iraq to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars of oil in
six months to buy food and medical materials desperately needed by
the Iraqi people, who have been suffering from hunger and diseases
since the U.N. imposed an economic sanction in 1990 in reaction to
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations plans to deploy 151 observers for
distributing food, 23 customs officials for checking the arrival
of cargos and 14 inspectors for supervising Iraq's exporting of
oil.
</P>
<P>
A staff of eight U.N. officials will be coordinating the
application of the plan from the U.N. New York headquarters.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Renews Angola Peace Force for Only a Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council on Thursday renewed the mandate of the U.N. peace-keeping
force in Angola for only one month, until March 31 because the
former UNITA rebels delays in establishing a national unity
government in the country.
</P>
<P>
The move was taken at the suggestion of Secretary-General Kofi
Annan. He said in a recent report he would recommend a two-month
extension of the U.N. force if the national unity government were
formed before its expiry at the end of February.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, he recommended only a one-month renewal, until the
end of March.
</P>
<P>
In a unanimous resolution, the council warned that it was
ready, in case of further delay, to impose trade sanctions on
UNITA and travel restrictions on its senior officials.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Angolan Verification Mission (UNAVEM III), now has
more than 6,000 troops, observers and police, has been helping
oversee a peace accord which the government led by President Jose
Eduardo dos Santos signed with UNITA in Lusaka Zambia, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Establishment of a national unity government, originally
scheduled for January 25, was postponed, largely because of
problems in finding an acceptable role for UNITA leader Jonas
Savimbi, who still controls much of Angola, including diamond-rich
areas.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council resolution expressed deep concern at the
second delay in forming a national unity government "as a result
of the failure of UNITA" to meet an agreed timetable.
</P>
<P>
It urged the "government of Angola and in particular UNITA to
solve the remaining military and other issues and to establish,
without further delay, the government of unity and national
reconciliation."

<HEADLINE> EU Official Welcomes Self-Medication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 27 (Xinhua) -- A well-developed
self-medication can contribute to a higher level of health
protection, an EU official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Padraig Flynn, EU commissioner for social affairs, made the
remark Thursday at a conference on defining the scope of
responsible self-medication.
</P>
<P>
"Self-medication, if sensibly developed, can contribute to a
higher level of health protection. In particular, it allows for
greater scope for the individual to take responsibility for his
own health," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Flynn said that self-medication could ease the pressure on
doctors and the health services which were increasingly
over-stretched.
</P>
<P>
He went on to stress that self-medication was of particular
benefit in the treatment of minor ailments and illnesses, but it
was "not a solution for more serious conditions."
</P>
<P>
He warned the public that they should be aware of the need to
consult a doctor if in doubt or if symptoms persist, adding that
"on issues of health, precaution must always come first."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the continued upward pressure in public health
expenditure, the commissioner said that the question of the need
for cost-containment should not be under-estimated, and added that
"more self-care in circumstances of minor ailments can reduce the
burden on health services."

advance of the summit, on all three of those agenda items, " he
said.
</P>
<P>
The teams will talk about how will be a NATO-Russian charter
and how Russia and U.S. deal with other issues related to NATO
expansion, according to Johnson.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-Russian summit, scheduled on March 20-21, is taking
place at a time when the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
is planning to expand into the Central and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Moscow has been signaling strong opposition to the enlargement,
insisting that its national security is threatened.
</P>
<P>
However, reports say that Russia, which has taken a two-tiered
approach to the issue, seems to be putting fresh emphasis on
negotiating a compromise.

<HEADLINE> French National Assembly Adopts New Immigration Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The French National Assembly
(lower house of parliament) adopted this evening the strongly
contested new immigration law presented by Interior Minister
Jean-Louis Debre, after three days of heated debate.
</P>
<P>
However, the first and most controversial clause of the law,
which asked French homes to inform police the time of departure
from France of foreigners they had accommodated, was scrapped by
the president of the law commission of the parliament, Pierre
Mazeaud.
</P>
<P>
The clause triggered a wide-spread civil disobedience movement
and nationwide streets protests, initiated by some movie producers
who protested first the restriction of their invited foreigners
to work with them.
</P>
<P>
The corrected law, also called Debre bill in reference to the
interior minister, asks foreigners themselves to hand over to
French border police a registration card proving they have
left France.
</P>
<P>
The law was passed with 113 votes from the ruling rightwing
majority, and 61 votes against from the opposition leftwing
parties.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse (AFP) said that today's voting
contrasted with the first voting of the law in late December, when
most of the Socialist deputies were absent and let the law slip
through with an overwhelming support from the ruling majority.
</P>
<P>
A dramatic confrontation was seen on Wednesday between Interior
Minister Debre and the president of the Socialist group of
parliament, former Socialist prime minister Laurent Fabius, who
forced Debre to admit that the government intends to set up an
index system for all foreigner who have stayed in France.
</P>
<P>
The law has also drawn criticism from the European Parliament,
which voted last week that it should be withdrawn because it
reminded one of "invitation of denunciations" of foreigners of
old times.
</P>
<P>
Some French leftist politicians and intellectuals compared the
law with the persecution of Jews during the World War II Vichy
collaboration regime, which deported thousands of French Jews to
Nazi death camps.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the law was presented at a time when the far-right
National Front party, which publicly advocates the expulsion of
foreign immigrants, is rising on the political stage of France.

<HEADLINE> Frei Calls for Higher-level Chilean-U.S. Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chilean President
Eduardo Frei today, calling his nation as a platform for trade in
Latin America, urged the United States to hold higher-level
negotiations with his country on free trade deal.
</P>
<P>
"Our trade negotiations with the United States are of great
interest to us and we believe they should advance to higher
levels," said Frei in a speech before a joint meeting of U.S.
Congress.
</P>
<P>
"Before this Congress, let me reaffirm our interest in those
negotiations," Frei said. "We consider total trade liberalization
between Chile and the United States a natural step, as well as an
encouraging signal in the task of achieving free trade in
Americas."
</P>
<P>
Chile was invited in December, 1994, to join the United States,
Mexico and Canada in the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA). But it wants Congress to give the U.S. administration
"fast-track" authority to cut a deal that would be voted on
without any amendments. The authority ensures that a trade pact
would get a straight yes-or-no vote.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton said Wednesday after meeting Frei
in the White House that he was seeking the "fast-track" trade
negotiation authority from Congress to conclude new trade
agreements that "open markets to America's products.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said unless Congress quickly renews his authority to
expand NAFTA, the United States risks losing to European and Asian
competitors already moving into America's economic back yard.
</P>
<P>
But some politicians fear that an expanded NAFTA would increase
U.S. import from Latin American nations which would lead to losing
job opportunities in the country.
</P>
<P>
House of Representatives Minority leader Richard Gephardt, a
Missouri Democrat, wrote in a letter to his Democratic colleagues
on Wednesday that it would be "a fundamental mistake to simply
extend the current NAFTA. It simply isn't working."
</P>
<P>
But Frei said, "delays (of trade negotiations) today could mean
the weakening of many democracies, the rebirth of closed markets,
the consolidation of hunger and migrations."

<HEADLINE> US President Appeals for Balancing Budget Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- With the balanced budget
Constitutional amendment on its deathbed, President Clinton today
appealed to the U.S. Congress for passing a balancing budget plan
this year.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the U.S. Business Council, President Clinton
called on the Republicans in the Congress to quickly move away
from the politically divisive debate.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Senator Robert Torricelli announced Wednesday that he
couldn't accept the Republican version of Constitutional amendment
because he thought it left the nation too vulnerable in times of
military or economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
He was considered the decisive 67th vote that was needed for
the two-thirds majority for passage the balanced budget amendment
in the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
"It now seems clear that the balanced budget amendment will not
pass. I think that is a good thing for the reasons that I have
said elsewhere," President Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"But I think it must also be clear to the American people that
we must make sure that a balanced budget does pass, passes this
year and passes as soon as we can reasonably pass it," he said.
"We have to now go beyond the constitutional debate to get to the
specifics."
</P>
<P>
The balanced budget Constitutional amendment is scheduled to
put on vote in the U.S. senate next Tuesday, the probable date of
a final vote. But without the vote of Torricelli, the amendment
could face the same fate it met two years ago, when a balanced
budget amendment was defeated by one vote in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
Republican leaders are still trying to change somebody's mind.
But the chief sponsor of the bill, Senate Judiciary Committee
Chairman Orrin Hatch showed little interest in making concessions
to bring another Democrat on board.
