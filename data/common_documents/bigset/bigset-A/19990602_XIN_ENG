<HEADLINE> Russia Calls Emergency Council Meeting on UNSCOM's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Tuesday called an
emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council to
discuss what U.N weapons inspectors had left in their offices in
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press after the Council meeting, Russian
Ambassador to the United Nations, Sergery Lavrov, said the United
Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction had left some chemical
substances in their laboratory which was located in the Canal
Hotel in Baghdad before they withdrew last December.
</P>
<P>
Lavrov said this information came to Russia's knowledge only
days ago and Russia requested the further information about it.
</P>
<P>
Lavrov said Richard Butler, Executive Chairman of UNSCOM, was
asked to gave explanations about it at the meeting, and Butler
said nothing was dangerous there.
</P>
<P>
Council President for the current month Ismaila Jagne of Gambia
said Butler was requested to submit a report to give further
information.
</P>
<P>
Ismaila Jagne said the Council might get the report tonight and
the Council was scheduled to meet on the report Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM has not gone back to Iraq to resume its work since the
U.S.-led military strikes against the country last December.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has accused UNSCOM of spying for the United States and
vowed not to cooperate with it any longer.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council has been sharply divided on its policy
towards Iraq, especially on the future of UNSCOM. There are
initials which suggest UNSCOM be replaced by a new institution and
the Council has not reached agreement on it.

<P>
NICOSIA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus said Tuesday that it will
not take any initiative aimed at forging closer ties with North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Replying to questions during his daily press briefing, Cypriot
government spokesman Costas Serezis said that "the government will
not develop any initiative in this direction."
</P>

Commenting on a statement made by Greek Foreign Undersecretary
Gregoris Niotis that NATO could participate in an international
force on the Cyprus island after an agreement is reached, Serezis
said the Cypriot government supports the deployment of a
multi-national force.
</P>
<P>
He clarified that this force should have a mandate from the
U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with
Athens.

<HEADLINE> NATO Jets Repeatedly Bomb North Albanian Border Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- NATO fighter jets Tuesday repeatedly
dropped guided bombs on the Albanian side of border near the
Morina border crossing.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian news agency ATA reported that NATO warplanes first
attacked the Morina village, about 500 meters from the border
crossing, when the day was about to break.
</P>
<P>
At least three government defensive bunkers, in which Albanian
borderguards sheltered against Serb shellings just a day ago, were
destroyed in the early-morning NATO attack.
</P>
<P>
Huge craters created by the NATO bombs dotted the hilly
terrains bordering Kosovo, a southern Serbian province of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Telephone lines were damaged but no casualties were reported.
</P>
<P>
The English marking on a piece of bomb fragments --"For Use on
MK-82.Fin Guided Bomb" indicated that it was the work of NATO.
</P>
<P>
Before noon, NATO warplanes came back again, hit the same area
with at least seven guided bombs, and sent about 50 people,
including Albanian soldiers and some 20 journalists, who were
conducting an on-the-spot check, running for shelter in panic.
</P>
<P>
A NATO warplane seemed to run after the journalists while
dropping bombs, a witness was quoted by the private television
Klan as saying.
</P>
<P>
The puzzled 1,500 villagers, and some Kosovo refugees who
stayed with them, started to evacuate from the Morina village this
morning.
</P>
<P>
They had managed to stay in the village despite Serb artillery
pounding but they were now under bombing of NATO, which they
believed was on their side.
</P>
<P>
NATO has been reportedly helping the Kosovo Liberation Army
(KLA) in the raging fierce fightings over the past week between
KLA and Serb troops the nearby hills on the Kosovo side of border.
</P>
<P>
KLA rebels, seen by Belgrade as terrorists, have been trying to
open a supply corridor running from the border area of Albania to
Prizren, a Kosovo city about 30 kilometers from the Morina border
crossing.
</P>
<P>
A KLA spokesman claimed that with better weapons, the rebels
are more balanced now with Serb soldiers in Kosoov. But dead or
injured KLA members continuousely taken out of Kosovo into Albania
clearly indicated that the Serbs were on their targets in the
battle.
</P>
<P>
As each day passes, the situation on the northeast border of
Albania becomes increasingly tense and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
A Chilean journalist was wounded in the head and subsequently
died in a shooting incident last week at the Morina border
crossing. Albanian borderguards all evacuated from their posts to
the nearby army barracks.
</P>
<P>
To review the worsening situation on the border, Albanian
President Rexhep Meidani called an emergency meeting on Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, it was decided to intensify military actions
against what the Albanians say Serb provocations.

<HEADLINE> PKK Leader Confesses PKK Supporters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Abdullah Ocalan, leader of Turkey's
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), Tuesday confessed at his
trial that many Middle East and European countries and clandestine
groups had collaborated with his group.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Ankara Security Court No. 2 on Monday started the
trial of Ocalan on charges of treason on the Imrali Island near
Turkey's western province of Bursa.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions by the presiding judge of the trial,
Ocalan listed Syria, Greece, Cyprus, Iran, Iraq, Yugoslavia,
Armenia, Britain, Greek Orthodox Church and clandestine
extreme-left Turkish groups as some of the collaborators of the
PKK, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan said that PKK members who received training in Greece
were often airlifted to southeastern Turkey or northern Iraq
through Syria, Lebanon or Iran.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iraq in particular had provided intelligence to
the gang about Turkish military operations in northern
Iraq. Additionally, he claimed that northern Iraq had become a
free arms "bazaar" after the Gulf War in 1991, and the PKK had
bought some weapons there.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ocalan denied that his group was responsible for the
1986 assassination of Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, but said
that some rebels who had broken away from his group may have had
a hand in the slaying.
</P>
<P>
Palme was shot dead in a Stockholm street as he and his wife
walked home from a movie theater.
</P>
<P>
The PKK, led by Ocalan, has been fighting a 15-year-long war
for an independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey, which
has claimed over 37,000 lives since August 1984.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Convenes Special Session on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Outgoing Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu convened his inner cabinet meeting for a
special session Tuesday night on the situation in South Lebanon,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The radio report said Netanyahu summoned the cabinet of
selected key ministers, including Defense Minister Moshe Arens and
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, on a two-hour notice.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's office issued a terse statement after the session
that the ministers were updated by top security officials with
informations on the withdrawal of Israel-backed Lebanese militia
from the South Lebanon enclave of Jezzine and the activities of
the Israeli army in the security zone.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Arens and Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz
briefed Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak on the situation in
Lebanon, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA) Tuesday continued its
withdrawal from Jezzine north of the security zone, a
15-kilometer-deep buffer zone carved out by Israel in 1985 to
prevent cross-border attacks by Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Two SLA soldiers were killed and one was wounded by roadside
bombs planted by Hezbollah guerrillas while the militiamen
abandoned outlying positions and withdrew into the town of
Jezzine.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, Israeli warplanes struck repeatedly suspected
Hezbollah bases around Jezzine.
</P>
<P>
The SLA withdrawal from Jezzine, which began Monday night, is
seen by some as a possible prelude to a full Israeli withdrawal
from South Lebanon, but Israel has denied any connection between
them, emphasizing that an SLA withdrawal from Jezzine was purely
the decision of SLA leaders because casualties had become too
high.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who defeated Netanyahu in the elections last month, has
promised that he will pull Israeli troops out of South Lebanon
within a year since he comes to power through agreement with
Syria, the main power-broker in Lebanon.

JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak is
considering whether to, through consultations with the United
States and the Palestinians, drop the latest interim peace
agreement and jump to final status talks, the Haaretz daily

<P>
The paper quoted Labor sources as saying that Barak's
consideration is based on the premise that the broad coalition he
is trying to put together will have the necessary political clout
to make a final status deal, making the interim steps stipulated
in the Wye agreement unnecessary any more. (BC-Israel-Wye)

Truck convoys were also seen streaming out of the beleaguered

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Civilian Targets Bombed by U.S. Warplanes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Some Iraqi civilian targets in the
south of the country were bombed on Tuesday by U.S. and British
planes, an Iraqi military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed spokesman said that at 10:50 (0650 GMT) and
17: 00 (1300 GMT) 32 formations of enemy warplanes coming from
Kuwaiti and Saudi airspace violated southern Iraqi airspace over
the provinces of Basra, Thi-Qar, Qadissiya, Misan and Muthana.
</P>
<P>
He said that the enemy formations attacked civilian targets
in the region, adding that Iraqi anti-aircraft units fired back
and forced the enemy planes to flee at 19:20 (1520 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The spokesman did not mention whether casualties were caused.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. and Britain launched four-night airstrikes
against Iraq last December, their warplanes have been regularly
attacking Iraqi military and civilian targets in the no-fly zones,
causing severe civilian casualties and property damages.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in Iraq
following the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the
Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
"Baghdad's suppression."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has declared that it does not recognize these restricted
zones and vowed to continue confronting any allied plane violating
its airspace.

ATHENS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Greece Tuesday criticized
neighboring Turkey's tactics of improving bilateral ties while at
the same time making claims on Greek territory.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the letter by Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem

briefing that good relations between the two neighbors required
the corresponding stance from both sides, something that Turkey
was not doing.
</P>
<P>
He urged Turkey to go beyond words to deeds.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Cem called for cooperation and bettering

Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit Monday also urged Greece
to start a dialogue on disputes between the two countries over the
ownership of islets in the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey have been at odds over decades for their
disputes in the territorial waters, air space limits and the
delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean Sea, and the
Cyprus problem.

<P>
Greece has repeatedly said that Turkey should take its
unilateral claims to questioning Greek sovereignty over a number

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. industrial economy
expanded for a fourth straight month in May and prices paid by
manufacturers rose in the same period, said the National
Association of Purchasing Management Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The association said in a report that its monthly index of
business activity rose to 55.2 in May from 52.8 in April and its
index of prices paid by manufacturers rose in the same month to
52.2 percent for the first time in 16 months.
</P>
<P>
The results have sent the stock market lower in morning session
in fears of high inflation and interest rates. The Federal Reserve
warned two weeks ago that it would raise interest rates to cool
off the economy if inflation is building up.
</P>
<P>
But The Conference Board sent different economic signals. The
private research group reported the index of leading economic
indicators declined 0.1 percent in April to 107.1 for the first
time since June, 1998, suggesting some softening in the economy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said in its report that
construction spending fell by a sharp 2.4 percent in April, the
biggest monthly decline in more than five years.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Urges Greece to Cooperate Against Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem
urged Greece to offer cooperation in fighting against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to his Greek counterpart George Papandreou on May
26, Cem stressed the need for improving Turkish-Greek ties and
cooperation in various sectors, Turkey's Anatolia News Agency
Tuesday quoted diplomatic sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The sources, who asked not to be named, said that Turkey and
Greece should work together in combating terrorism, a reference to
Greece's support for Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
Cem said that an open Greek condemnation of the PKK and the end
of its support for the terrorist organization were preconditions
for any improvement in bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece should start a dialogue on jointly combating
terrorism and even sign an agreement in this area, Cem added.
</P>
<P>
Cem's letter came in the wake of a crisis over a disputed
Aegean island during which Papandreou called Cem on May 16, saying
that the two sides should not leave room for provocations but
maintain a spirit of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou has been seeking to thaw the tense atmosphere
between Ankara and Athens since he took over as foreign minister
following the dismissal of Theodoros Pangalos over his role in the
Ocalan crisis.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Turkey's Ankara Security Court No. 2 started the
trial of Ocalan on charges of treason on the Imrali Island in
Marmara Sea near Turkey's western province of Bursa.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was arrested by Turkish special agents in Kenya in
mid-February when he left the Greek Embassy in Nairobi, where he
had taken refuge for 12 days after an undisclosed odyssey seeking
asylum in vain.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican President Stresses Peace for Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano said here Tuesday that it is of great importance to
maintain peace and the unity of the nation and the harmony of the
family for the sake of children, without which the children will
have nothing left.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the occasion to mark the International Children's
Day, Chissano said that in the development of agriculture,
industry, communications, mining and tourism, enough attention
should be given to the protection of environment, random felling
of trees and the destruction of soil, water resources and
biological resources and the pollution of air should be banned, so
that the children can live in a pollution-free environment.
</P>
<P>
The president said that environment protection and the
protection of children's security demand the elimination of armed
conflicts, which have ended in environmental pollution, poverty
and hindered the economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the 24 years of progress the country has made in
improving children's condition since Mozambique's independence in
1975, Chissano said that another two million people in the
countryside have got better water supply in the past few years,
and about 35 percent of the whole population now have access to
clean water.
</P>
<P>
To protect children from bad impact from the society, the
parliament has passed a law banning children from going to
entertainment places in the night, and the government has also
taken measures to encourage orphaned or abandoned children to
return home.
</P>
<P>
He said that about 15,000 orphaned or abandoned children have
returned to their homes in the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Chissano also admitted that there is still a lot to do in
children protection, listing that some conventions on children's
protection are not well observed in the country, and many children
still suffer physically and spiritually from family violences,
AIDS and drugs.
</P>
<P>
He called on the government institutions, non-government
organizations, various organizations, families and other sectors
of the society to care about children.

engineering and sewing.
</P>
<P>
Lampreia noted that Brazil is interested in investing in the
petroleum sector. But he did not disclose any details in this
respect.
</P>
<P>
Brazil is a country with poor petroleum reserve. And since
1980s, Petrobras, the state-run national petroleum corporation of
the southern American country has been exploring and exploiting
oil in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian minister said that the debt Angola owes to Brazil
is under technical discussion and meanwhile, Brazil is ready to
release the credit which has been suspended for Angola.
</P>
<P>
Lampreia arrived in Luanda Monday on a two-day visit to the
southern African country. The purpose of his visit is to offer
"political and economic support" for Angola in a bid to help
achieve peace in the war- torn country, Brazilian Ambassador to
Luanda Alexandre Ador Neto said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian-Zambian Railway to Be Commercialized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania and Zambia have reached an
agreement to commercialize the Tanzanian-Zambian Railways
Authority (TAZARA) in order to revamp the performance of the
1,860- kilometer long railway.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Communications and Transport Minister David Saviye
announced the commercialization plan Tuesday and said the
performance of railway authority is not satisfactory at present.
</P>
<P>
He said discussions are underway with various stakeholders on
the future of the railway, including the possibility of a joint
venture with China, which completed the construction of the
railway in mid-1970s as economic aid to the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have reached consensus on making the railway
market- oriented and commercially viable with privatization or
joint venture approach, he said.
</P>
<P>
The volume of transport of the inter-country railway stood at
550,000 tons in 1997 compared with 1.2 million tons in 1993, while
in 1998 the volume was slightly higher, reaching 639,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The minister also admitted the significant role the railway
has played and will continue to play in enhancing investment,
trade and development in the sub-region.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav War a Failure for NATO, Says Former </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The war in Yugoslavia waged by the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was characterized by
failure and the violation of numerous principles, a former German
official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Oskar Lafontaine, former German finance minister, said at a
book presentation in Athens that the aims of NATO's intervention
had not been attained, given that it had not helped the people of
Kosovo, on the contrary, it had contributed further to their
uprooting, the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine, who resigned earlier this year as chairman of
Germany's ruling Social Democrat Party, said that it was not
possible to defend human rights by bombing civilians. The way in
which NATO was acting was unacceptable, he added.
</P>
<P>
They could not make things right if they did not take into
consideration existing international law and did not strengthen
it, the former minister said, adding that the United Nations
Security Council should not be passed over.

<HEADLINE> NATO Planes Hit Albanian Bunkers on Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- NATO planes dropped bombs about four
kilometers on the Albanian side of border overnight Tuesday,
destroying at least two Albanian government bunkers and some
telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
The bombs created some huge craters on the ground and the
English markings on the shrapnels revealed that it was the work of
NATO planes.
</P>
<P>
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
sources were quoted as saying that seven bombs were dropped inside
Albania, with one of them bursting just 500 meters from its team.
</P>
<P>
No casualties were reported so far.
</P>
<P>
How NATO planes, which have been striking Serb air-defense
targets in Kosovo near the border, mistargeted the bunkers was not
known immediately.
</P>
<P>
Fierce fightings have been raging on in nearby hills around the
Morina border crossing over the past week between Serb troops and
the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), which is seen by Belgrade as a
terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
The KLA, which has been trying to open a new supply corridor
from Albania to Prizren, 30 kilometers from the border, claimed
that with better weapons, they were much balanced with the Serb
troops now.
</P>
<P>
But the injured KLA members taken out of Kosovo into Albania
show clearly that Serb army soldiers were on their target.
</P>
<P>
With each day passes, the situation at the Morina border
crossing becomes increasingly tense and dangerous. Albanian
borderguards have evacuated from their posts to the nearby
barracks and some are seen standing under big trees.
</P>
<P>
But Kosovo refugees keep pouring into Albania through the
crossing.
</P>
<P>
In the meanwhile, an Albanian newspaper reported Tuesday that a
defused NATO bomb fell into a seaside restaurant in the Albanian
port of Durres on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
When the incident occurred, a number of people including some
Italian military policemen were eating in the restaurant, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, Albanian president Rexhep Meidani held an
emergency meeting to review the tense situation on the
northeastern border and discussed the measures which need to be
taken.
</P>
<P>
The meeting decided to intensify military actions against
Yugoslav troops in the border areas.

UNITED NATIONS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council Tuesday morning is meeting on the United Nations Special

</P>
<P>
UNSCOM has not gone back to Iraq to resume its work since the

three of the five permanent members of the Council.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Peace Core of Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli-Palestinian peace is
the essence of the Middle East peace process and Israel's peace
with Syria and Lebanon should not be at the expense of the
Palestinian track, senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I don not think we will allow tracks against tracks. We would
be happy to see Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights and
Lebanese territory, the point is that we want to reach a
comprehensive peace on all tracks," Erekat told Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came a day after the pro-Israeli South Lebanon
Army (SLA) began to pull out of the south Lebanon enclave of
Jezzine in a move widely seen as a prelude to a larger-scale
Israeli withdrawal from a buffer zone it carved out in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak has promised during
his successful election campaign that he would withdraw Israeli
troops from south Lebanon within a year through an agreement with
Syria, the real power behind Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Syria wants Israel to hand over the Golan Heights it seized in
the 1967 Middle East war. Talks between the two sides broke off
in early 1996, but the Israeli government confirmed Sunday that
the two sides had conducted secret talks through various channels
from mid-1997 to late 1998.
</P>
<P>
In their first talks since the May 17 elections, outgoing
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu briefed Barak Tuesday on these
talks, in which some progress had been reportedly made on
security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians are concerned that Barak might devote most of
his attention to the Lebanese and Syrian tracks after his
government begins to operate, thus postponing peacemaking with
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is "the core of the
(Israeli-Arab) problems," Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
The senior Palestinian official also urged Barak to stand up
against the intensified moves by the departing government to
expand Jewish settlements, saying his silence on this issue was
"uncomprehensible."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians worried that Barak, who is trying to form a
broad-based coalition government, might not move firmly to curb
settlement building despite his pledge to revive peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
Warning that they will not resume peace negotiations with
Israel without a halt to the settlement activities, Palestinian
officials have called for a "day of Palestinian anger" against
settlement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said he hoped the Palestinians will voice their anger
peacefully in the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
Yossi Beilin, a senior Labor legislator, called on the
Palestinian National Authority to stop "flaming the passion"
before it was turned into violence.

ATHENS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Greece said Tuesday that it would
continue to implement its policy of granting residence permits to

Commenting on the recent statements by Albanian Foreign

Greece had done much to help Albania, Reppas said, noting that

In the first three months of this year, about 45,000 foreigners
working and residing illegally in Greece have been repatriated,
and only those economic immigrants with green cards will be

<HEADLINE> Neighboring Country Leaders Call for Peace in DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania, Uganda and Rwanda
agreed Tuesday on the urgency of restoring peace in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
A joint communique issued after a mini-summit here on the DRC
between Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa, Uganda's Yoweri
Museveni and Rwanda's Pasteur Bizimungu, said they deliberated on
steps towards a peaceful solution to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The day-long summit, which was also attended by Rwanda's
Vice-President and Minister of Defense, Paul Kagame, is an
extension of the one held in central Tanzania's Dodoma town in
early May.
</P>
<P>
The communique said the summit welcomed the commitment made by
the DRC and Uganda towards achieving a peaceful solution to the
conflict which has started since last August.
</P>
<P>
The heads of states also welcomed the unilateral cessation of
hostilities declared by Rwanda, a measure which is intended to
enhance chances of a negotiated and comprehensive ceasefire
agreement within the context of the Lusaka Peace Process.
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters after the talks, which lasted about four
hours at the State House, President Mkapa underlined the need for
withdrawal of troops from the DRC by all parties involved in the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa explained that the issue is not just centered on
withdrawal of troops of countries supporting the rebels but also
those bolstering the DRC government.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa added that Tuesday's summit is aimed at working out a
conducive environment through which peace and stability could be
restored in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Chad has withdrawn its troops from the DRC. Uganda began
pulling out of the southwestern part of the mineral-rich country.
On May 28, Rwanda declared a unilateral cease-fire there. All
these constitute a good beginning to the final negotiated
settlement to the conflict.

<HEADLINE> Mir to Work in Unmanned Mode From Mid-August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Mir Space Station's crew
will leave the orbiter in mid-August and switch it to automatic
regime in anticipation for its eventual demise in the Earth's
atmosphere unless fresh capital is found to send new cosmonauts
before early 2000.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made Tuesday at a meeting of chief designers
of the space industry, the Itar-Tass news agency reported, quoting
Mikhail Sinelshchikov, head of the Russian Space Agency's
Department of Piloted Programs.
</P>
<P>
Chances are slim, however, to find necessary funding for the
dispatch of new crew, as the government's provision of budget
money will end in mid-August and repeated efforts to seek private
capital have ended in vain.
</P>
<P>
The current crew of the Mir, which include Russians Viktor
Afanasyev and Sergei Avdeyev and French Jean-Pierre Haignere, may
be the last inhabitants of the Mir.
</P>
<P>
A Progress cargo ship is expected to be sent to the 13-year-old
space station in July to bring special equipment for the station's
remote control. The crew will assemble the equipment in
preparation for its unmanned functioning after August.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the crew's departure, they will install a new computer
allowing ground controllers to command the station without a crew
on board.
</P>
<P>
Mir's orbit, now about 240 miles above Earth, will gradually
diminish. At about 125 miles above the Earth, ground controllers
will send a final command that will cause the station to burn up
in the atmosphere, probably in February or March.

<HEADLINE> Russia Sees Kosovo Indictment as Politically Motivated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Tuesday that the
decision to indict senior Yugoslav political and military leaders
"can only be viewed as being motivated by strictly political
considerations," saying that the move has greatly complicated the
on-going negotiation, which is entering "most crucial phase."
</P>
<P>
The statement was made by Sergey Lavrov, Russian permanent
representative to the United Nations, in his letter to the U.N.
Secretary-General, which is being distributed here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian ambassador also cast doubts on the impartiality of
the prosecutor, who remains silent on the crimes committed by the
U.S.-led NATO in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"The decision by the International Tribunal for the Former
Yugoslavia, Louise Arbour, to indict five senior political and
military leaders of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, including
the president of the Federal Republic and the president of Serbia,
can only be viewed as being motivated by strictly political
considerations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The haste with which the prosecutor conducted the entire
investigation and reached this categorical conclusion is
astonishing, even though it is quite clear that in view of the
current situation in and around Yugoslavia such decisions require
exceptional thoroughness and care," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It can hardly be coincidental that such a step was taken at
the very time that negotiations on a settlement of the Kosovo
problem are entering their most crucial phase," he said. "As a
result, the negotiating process has been significantly
complicated."
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, Louise Arbour remains surprisingly passive
in the face of the obvious fact of the aggression by NATO against
Yugoslavia and looks indifferently on the consequences of two
months of relentless bombing in that country," he said.
</P>
<P>
"She remains untouched by the deaths of hundreds of completely
innocent persons, the destruction of the country's economic and
social infrastructure, th reduction of historic monuments to
rubble and the approaching environmental disaster," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Was it not the prosecutor's concern to look into who gave the
order to inflict the massive strikes which are having such awful
consequences? Unfortunately, Louise Arbour is entirely silent on
all these questions, which hardly testifies to her impartiality,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is continuing its efforts to find a just political
settlement, and to that end will work even harder with all
necessary parties, including Yugoslavia," he said. "This is
consistent also with the role that the international community has
entrusted to Russia in resolving the current crisis in the
Balkans."
</P>
<P>
Russia is joining the seven major industrialized in hammering
out a peace initiative, which is to be discussed at the 15-nation
U.N. Security Council while its special envoy for the Balkans,
Viktor Chernomyrdin is mediating a diplomatic solution.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade has announced its decision to accept "the general
principle" of the eight power countries on the settlement of the
Kosovo crisis, which broke out in February last year since ethnic
Albanians have been fighting with Serbs for independence.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Construction Spending Falls by a Sharp 2.4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Commerce Department reported
Tuesday that U.S. construction spending plunged by a sharp 2.4
percent in April, the biggest monthly decline in more than 5
years.
</P>
<P>
The Department said the April decline followed five straight
monthly increases including a 1.3 percent gain in March and a
sizable 2.1 percent rise in February. The April decline was the
first setback since a 0.3 percent drop last October and it was the
biggest monthly decrease since a 3 percent drop in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Department's report showed that spending on residential
construction dropped by 1 percent in April to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 324.7 billion dollars with both single-family homes
and apartments suffering declines.
</P>
<P>
The April's construction spending for all private building
projects was off 1.9 percent as spending on factories, office
buildings, hotels and hospitals all saw declines. Spending on
private construction had been up 1.9 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
Spending on government construction projects fell an even
sharper 4.2 percent in April, the largest decline in this category
since a 4.8 percent decrease last May. Public spending had fallen
0.8 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
The report said spending for highways, hospitals and water
supply facilities were all down while spending on military
facilities and housing redevelopment recorded increases.
</P>
<P>
For April, spending on all construction projects totaled 697.4
billion dollars at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, up 8 percent
from the spending level in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
Construction spending had been one of the driving forces in the
U.S. economic expansion. The sharp drop of 2.4 percent in April
caught analysts by surprise. In the first three months of this
year, home building and other construction activity driven by low
mortgage rates was a key contributing factor to the strong
economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Military Head Meets With Thai Defense Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Fu Quanyou, the chief of General
Staff of the People's Liberation Army, in a meeting here today
with the Thai Permanent Secretary for Defense Teeradej Meepien,
said that global multi-polarization is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
Fu said that in spite of significant and profound changes in
the world today, peace and development are still the main concern.
</P>
<P>
He expressed satisfaction with the cooperation between the
Chinese and Thai armed forces and their high-level exchanges, and
said he hopes that the bilateral friendship will continue to
develop in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Teeradej spoke highly of relations between the two nations and
their armed forces. He tendered his sympathy for the Chinese
Embassy in Yugoslavia which was attacked by U.S.-led NATO in early
May and expressed his understanding and support of the indignation
and demand of the Chinese government and people.
</P>
<P>
Fu said that NATO has bombed Yugoslavia, a sovereign nation,
for some 70 days and has brought serious tragedy to the Yugoslav
people. This is simple hegemony and power politics, he said,
adding that U.S.-led NATO's attack on the Chinese embassy is a
wantonly trampling on Chinese sovereignty and that China requires
them to give a full explanation.
</P>
<P>
China needs to speed up its military modernization, he said,
because it will contribute to Chinese sovereignty, national
security, and social stability.

<HEADLINE> Low Inflation May Push Pay Rises Below 3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON June 1 (Xinhua) - Wage settlements in Britain are set to
dip below the 3 percent mark in the coming months due to falling
inflation, sluggish economic growth and weak company profits.
</P>
<P>
However, the key determinant of pay was still the Retail Price
Index and the current headline rate of 1.6 percent is forecast to
dip to 1.1 percent by the end of the year, according to the pay
analysts Industrial Relations Services (IRS).
</P>
<P>
In a report published Tuesday, IRS says deals in the crucial
April pay round, when most increases take effect, averaged 3
percent for the fourth month in a row despite low unemployment and
the recent introduction of a national minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
Half the pay deals were worth between 2.5 and 3.3 percent, down
from the 2.8 to 3.5 percent range in March and well below
January's 3 to 3.6 percent spread.
</P>
<P>
Analysts at IRS argue that pay settlements will probably follow
falling inflation and "the overall distribution of wage deals may
drift down further in the months ahead".
</P>
<P>
The declining settlements will alleviate the inflationary blip
predicted around the millennium holiday when some employers are
predicted to pay substantial bonuses.

<HEADLINE> UK Labor Costs Still Competitive in EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON June 1 (Xinhua) - Despite the strength of the pound
Britain's labor costs are still competitive against many of the
other EU states, according to a report published Tuesday by
William Mercer.
</P>
<P>
The launch of the euro has helped to expose wide differences in
labor costs across the European Union, where the highest employer
costs are nearly four times the lowest, says the consultants.
</P>
<P>
The report also shows tat the UK and the other EU states still
struggle to compete with the US employment market.
</P>
<P>
The UK appears in the middle of the ranking (eighth out of 15)
with average labor costs amounting to 35,439 euros (23,000
pounds).
</P>
<P>
In general, costs are higher in the northern European states
such as Belgium, Denmark, Sweden and Germany and lower in southern
Europe in countries such as Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
The report states that with the pound strong against the euro,
"UK labor costs are still competitive against many other EU
states".

<HEADLINE> U.S. Leading Index Falls 0.1 Percent in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The composite index of leading
U.S. economic indicators fell 0.1 percent in April for the first
time since June, 1998, the Conference Board, a prominent research
group, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The group said in a report that the change in direction does
not signal a recession but suggests some softening in the U.S.
economy.
</P>
<P>
"This looks like only a temporary pause, although last week's
drop in the stock market adds some complications," said Michael
Boldin, Director of Business Cycle Research at the Conference
Board. "Still, with most of the leading indicators, including the
stock market, showing increases this year and the economy showing
growth in so many areas, this expansion should continue and become
the longest ever in early 2000."
</P>
<P>
The report said the leading index fell 0.1 percent in April to
107.1, the first decline since June, 1998, when the index dropped
0.2 percent. The March value has been revised down to show no
change and during the six-month span through April, the leading
index rose 1.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report said, six out of the ten of the indicators that make
up the leading index fell in April. The most significant decreases
are vendor performance, average weekly initial claims for state
unemployment insurance and building permits.

<HEADLINE> NATO Planes Bomb Albanian Bunkers on Border With Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- NATO warplanes dropped bombs about
four kilometers on the Albanian side of the border with Yugoslavia
overnight Tuesday, destroying at least two Albanian government
bunkers and some telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
The bombs created some huge craters on the ground and the
English markings on the shrapnels revealed that it was the work of
NATO planes.
</P>
<P>
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
sources were quoted as saying that seven bombs were dropped inside
Albania, with one of them bursting just 500 meters from its team.
</P>
<P>
No casualties were reported so far.
</P>
<P>
How NATO planes, which have been striking Yugoslav air-defense
targets in Kosovo near the border, bombed the bunkers was not
known immediately.
</P>
<P>
Fierce fightings have been raging on in nearby hills around the
Morina border crossing over the past week between Yugoslav troops
and the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA).
</P>
<P>
The KLA has been trying to open a new supply corridor from
Albania to Prizren, 30 kilometers from the border.
</P>
<P>
With each day passes, the situation at the Morina border
crossing becomes increasingly tense and dangerous. Albanian
border guards have evacuated from their posts to the nearby
barracks and some are seen standing under big trees.
</P>
<P>
As NATO continues its airstrikes against Yugoslavia, Kosovo
refugees keep pouring into Albania through the crossing.
</P>
<P>
An Albanian newspaper reported Tuesday that a defused NATO bomb
fell into a seaside restaurant in the Albanian port of Durres on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
When the incident occurred, a number of people including some
Italian military policemen were dining in the restaurant, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, Albanian president Rexhep Meidani held an
emergency meeting to review the tense situation on the
northeastern border and discussed the measures which need to be
taken.

</P>
<P>
China on Kosovo Issue
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit of Yugoslav leader by the United States and a few
NATO nations is but a carefully plotted political scheme aiming at
legalizing their aggressive war against the sovereign state of
Yugoslavia, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said
today.
</P>
<P>
China is ready to enhance consultation with Russia on the
Kosovo issue as the two countries "share similar or identical

</P>
<P>
China, U.S. Relations
</P>
<P>
Zhu Bangzao today urged the U.S. government to take more

behalf of the Chinese government over the U.S. Defense
Department's announcement to sell Hell Fire Missiles and advanced
intelligence and electronic equipment to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
China, DPRK Ties
</P>
<P>
The maintaining of friendly relations between China and the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) are conducive to
peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, said Foreign
Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao.
</P>
<P>
China will contribute its efforts to consolidating and
developing the Sino-DPRK relations, Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> India Offers to Consider Safe Passage for "Infiltrators" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 1 (Xinhua) -- India on Tuesday offered to
consider a "safe passage" for what it termed as Pakistani
"infiltrators" in the Kargil area in Kashmir for retreating to
their side of the line of control (LOC).
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister George Fernandes Tuesday ruled out any
compromise in the on-going conflict with Pakistan, saying that New
Delhi's position was very clear that all those who had been pushed
into India's territory must go back across the LOC.
</P>
<P>
Asked if India could negotiate a cease-fire or a settlement to
end the border conflict during the planned visit of Pakistani
Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz to New Delhi, Fernandes said the
issue of safe passage (for infiltrators) could be considered.
</P>
<P>
An Indian military commander said here Tuesday that Indian
troops, backed by air strikes, intensified their efforts to
isolate intruders in the Kargil sector.
</P>
<P>
Intense fighting was also going on at two places in the Patalik
sector, Brigadier Mohan Bhandari informed reporters here, adding
that Indian troops had made a "steady progress" in the Kargil
sector.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that intelligence reports indicated that the
infiltrators were being given reinforcements from across the LOC.
</P>
<P>
Fernandes said Tuesday the armed conflict between the two
neighbors "may not be a long drawn affair and neither will it be
an easy one."
</P>
<P>
India has agreed to a visit by Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz to defuse what caretaker Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee described as a war-like situation in Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the External Affairs Ministry said Tuesday that
India was yet to receive any specific date from Pakistan for the
visit.
</P>
<P>
"We have received a proposal which we have accepted. But there
is no specific time frame," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> ILO Head Calls for Improved Working Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Head of the International Labor
Organization (ILO) Juan Somavia has urged governments and
employers to improve the lives and working conditions of workers.
</P>
<P>
In his first report to the International Labor Conference which
began here Tuesday, the ILO's new director-general said that "the
primary goal of the ILO today is to promote opportunities for
women and men to obtain decent and productive work, in conditions
of freedom, equity, security and human dignity".
</P>
<P>
Somavia, who took office last March, pledged that his
organization would pursue four strategic objectives: the promotion
of rights at work, employment, social protection, and social
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ILO needs to be concerned with all workers,
including the large majority of the workforce in developing
countries whose efforts to achieve well-being are circumscribed by
the poor wages, low productivity and inadequate social protection
found in informal sector activities, which are gaining ground in
many countries.
</P>
<P>
Somavia said that in addition to seeking improvements in the
conditions of work, the ILO needs to commit itself to expanding
opportunities for employment.
</P>
<P>
"The ILO is, therefore, as much concerned with the unemployed,
and with policies to overcome unemployment and underemployment, as
it is with the promotion of rights at work," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ILO head also called for a new consensus to be forged
between the international community, business and labor to address
the social consequences of globalization.
</P>
<P>
In years to come, he said, the major issue confronting the
international community "will be the adaptation of national
economies and institutions to global change, including the
adaptation of global change to human needs".
</P>
<P>
In view of the economic and social challenges wrought by
globalization, the ILO head said that "the ILO will be called upon
to deal with recurring crises of adjustment and development over
the next decade. It must now organize itself for this purpose".
</P>
<P>
China is among the 174 ILO members present at the 87th session
of the ILO's governing body. The meeting will end on June 17.

<HEADLINE> WIPO Launches First Distance Learning Course Over Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The World Intellectual Property
Organization (WIPO) launched its first distance learning course
over the Internet tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"This innovative online teaching technique will bring teachers
specializing in intellectual property issues closer to students
and other interested parties in all corners of the world through
virtual means," said the Geneva-based WIPO in its press release.
</P>
<P>
The method will allow anyone seeking more information about
intellectual property to follow a range of educational programs in
intellectual property at their own pace in their own space, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The course is the first of a series of Internet-based programs
to be developed by the WIPO Worldwide Academy WWA), which is
entirely devoted to teaching and training in intellectual
property.
</P>
<P>
Teaching will take place in the virtual environment of the WWA
website, http://academy.wipo.int. A network of tutors has been
established in various regions of the world to support students
during their work. Students and teachers can interact as often as
necessary during the course.
</P>
<P>
"Distance should no longer be an obstruction to instruction,"
said WIPO Director-General Kamil Idris. "The academy's distance
learning initiative will enable students anywhere in the world to
learn about the basics of intellectual property. We hope this
program will flourish to include more advanced courses in the near
future."

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Tuesday described the
situation at the Line of Control (LoC) in Kashmir as "very
serious," and said it would continue to take appropriate measures
to defend its territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
"If they (India) tried to cross Line of Control (LoC) and
captured our positions or tried to push us back from our positions
then it would be unacceptable," Brig. Rashid Qureshi, director
general of the Inter Services Public Relations told a news
briefing here.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question, Qureshi said the situation at LoC is
"dangerous and tense."
</P>
<P>
Over the past 36 hours, Qureshi said, there has been continuing
artillery fire from the Indian side in Kargil-Drass sector and
across rest of the LoC.
</P>
<P>
He said India launched three attacks during this time which
were beaten back. A Pakistan army captain and two soldiers died in
these offensives, he added.
</P>
<P>
"There have been eight to ten causalities in each attack from
the Indian side," said Qureshi.
</P>
<P>
The situation at the LoC in the disputed Kashmir region has
been tense since early last month when the two south Asian
neighbors exchanged fire there.

<HEADLINE> Pro-Israeli Militia Starts Withdrawal Amid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Amid heavy attacks by Lebanese
guerrillas, the pro-Israeli militia South Lebanon Army (SLA)
Tuesday started a pullout from Jezzine in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The SLA militiamen knocked down earth mounds and dynamited
fortified positions in and around Jezzine, just north of the
Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Truck convoys were also seen streaming out of the beleaguered
town, carrying artillery and motor guns, equipment, ammunition and
household furniture to the Israeli self-declared security zone
which it set up in 1985 to shield its northern flank from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
But, the pullout was accompanied by intensified attacks by
Hezbollah, or Party of God, in which two roadside bombs killed two
SLA militiamen and wounded another on Tuesday in Jezzine.
</P>
<P>
Israeli jets staged dozens of bombing sorties against suspected
Hezbollah strongholds near Jezzine as an air cover for its ally's
smooth pullout.
</P>
<P>
During the air raids, three Syrian workers were wounded in
Iqlim Toufah, north of the occupied zone, security sources said.
</P>
<P>
Despite SLA's declaration that the pullout occurs on Tuesday
and ends by mid-June, most residents in Jezzine expect the
withdrawal to be conducted in two stages and to be completed by
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The first stage involves the militia redeploying in Jezzine
from nearby strongholds and the second stage will see the militia
withdrawing to the occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said SLA has abandoned strongholds in Roum,
Homsiyah, Azour and Qaitolieh around Jezzine and barricaded
itself inside the town.
</P>
<P>
The 2,500-strong militia decided to leave the area as it
suffered many casualties in the past, according to the SLA's
commander Gen. Antoine Lahd, who formally announced the
withdrawal plan in a news conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 SLA fighters have been killed and about 400
others wounded in attacks by Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Lahd warned that the area not be used by Hezbollah as a base,
corridor or launching pad for attacks on Israelis in south
Lebanon, hoping Lebanese authorities would send troops to
Jezzine to protect local residents.
</P>
<P>
But, it is not immediately clear whether the Lebanese army
would take over Jezzine after the SLA departure.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government has been reluctant to commit regular
troops to Jezzine lest this is interpreted as providing security
guarantees for Israel.
</P>
<P>
But Prime Minister Salim Hoss said the government would take
full responsibility for the security and safety of the remaining
5,000 residents in the town after the end of SLA's 14-year
reign.
</P>
<P>
The SLA is trained and financed by Israel to help it patrol
the occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
Its members are considered as traitors in Lebanon and Lahd has
been sentenced to death in absentia by a military court.

<HEADLINE> Pak PM Calls For Collective Efforts to Settle Afghan Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif Tuesday called for collective efforts by Afghanistan's
neighboring countries for the solution to the Afghan turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Sharif made the remarks during his talks here with visiting
Uzbek Foreign Minister Abdulaziz Kamilov.
</P>
<P>
According to a Foreign Office statement, Sharif underscored the
paramount importance of the countries bordering Afghanistan to
concert their efforts to promote the Afghan peace process.
</P>
<P>
He went on to stress the need for Pakistan and Uzbekistan to
work closely to facilitate the realization of this objective,
according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the entire region could be transformed
to one of economic vibrant, self-sustained growth and prosperity
for which it was essential that durable peace returns to
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Touching upon bilateral relations, Sharif emphasized the
importance of giving substance to the "excellent relations"
between Pakistan and Uzbekistan through enhanced economic and
commercial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two countries should fully exploit the
enormous potential that exists through the establishment of oil
and gas pipelines, trade routes, communication networks as well as
transport and road links.
</P>
<P>
Kamilov fully agreed with the prime minister, said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also handed over a letter to Sharif from
Uzbek President Islam Karimov on the Afghanistan issue.
</P>
<P>
Kamilov arrived here on Monday and left Tuesday for southern
Afghan city Kandahar, headquarters of the Taliban militia, where
he is expected to discuss with the militia the peace process in
the war-torn country.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: NATO Won't Compromise on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen said on Tuesday that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) will not compromise on its demand that the alliance be "at
the core" of any security force that enters Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"By being at the core, that means there must be a command and
control structure that is NATO's in charge of any peacekeeping
operation," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after addressing a suburban Washington
high school, Cohen said that NATO is planning to put as many as
50,000 armed troops in a peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
But Cohen reiterated that it would enter Kosovo only after
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic gives up fighting ethnic
Albanian rebels and withdraws his troops.
</P>
<P>
Cohen also ruled out a pause in the bombing campaign, as
demanded in a letter delivered from Belgrade to German Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer in which Yugoslav officials said they
accepted NATO's principals for a peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
The letter said that Belgrade will accept "a United Nations
presence, mandate and other elements to be decided by a U.N.
Security Council resolution in accordance with the United Nations
charter."
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the bombing would stop only when Milosevic accepted
all of NATO's main demands, including the return of hundreds of
thousands of ethnic Albanians refugees, and withdrawal of his
troops to demonstrate his acceptance of peace.
</P>
<P>
"A pause would only serve Milosevic's interests," Cohen said.
"He is seeking to try to divide the alliance. He's seeking delay.
We are now at the point where the air campaign is being
intensified on a 24-hour basis."
</P>
<P>
Greece, Italy and other European countries have also proposed
such a pause in the alliance's bombing to give peace a chance.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- European bourses closed mainly in
the red Tuesday with London the only major market to resist the
selling pressures from Wall Street as its blue chips ended the
session in the black.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 closed 23.8 points higher at 6250 a gain of 0.38
percent, having been at one stage up more than 100 points at
6354.3.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts warned that relatively thin trading had
accentuated some of the gains as worries over the next move in
U.S. interest rates sent Wall Street sharply lower.
</P>
<P>
A stronger-than-expected U.S. National Association of
Purchasing Management report weighed on U.S. shares and took the
shine off the London market.
</P>
<P>
Other European markets, which had traded weakly throughout the
session, succumbed much earlier to Wall Street's early losses.
</P>
<P>
The Xetra Dax in Frankfurt was the biggest loser among the main
bourses, ending the session almost 58 points lower, a fall of 1.14
percent, at 5010.71.
</P>
<P>
The Germany's largest retailer, Metro, felt the brunt of an
analyst downgrade from buy to hold, with the stock losing almost 3
percent to close at 59 euros.
</P>
<P>
The CAC 40 in Paris ended 0.86 percent lower on the day, as it
shed 38 points to close at 4313.69.

<HEADLINE> UNDP, EC Join Hands to Preserve Forests in 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) and the European Commission (EC) have
launched a joint initiative to strengthen sustainable forestry
management and to support sustainable livelihood programs in
Cameroon, Guyana and Malawi, UNDP officials said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP's Sustainable Energy and Environment Division (SEED)
is expected to begin soon activities under the new collaboration,
in which EC will commit 2.06 million U.S. dollars to the joint
effort, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The initiative, which will be administered through UNDP's
Program on Forests (PROFOR), will make an important contribution
to preserving forests and to promoting the sustainable use of
forests resources by consolidating existing efforts and designing
national programs that both protect forests and fight poverty
through sustainable livelihood strategies.
</P>
<P>
In Cameroon, the program will strengthen national capacities in
sustainable forestry management and will create a mechanism to
coordinate and exchange information on forestry and sustainable
and economically viable use of the country's forestry resources.
</P>
<P>
In Malawi, the effort will respond to locally identified
priorities, such as the need for innovative finance mechanisms,
capacity building, support for planning mechanisms and the
development of key indicators needed for policy formulation.
</P>
<P>
The initiative forms a strategic alliance between the UNDP and
the EC that underscores the high priority given to forestry
issues by both organizations.
</P>
<P>
UNDP's Program on Forests builds on the recommendations of the
Commission on Sustainable Development's Intergovernmental Panel on
Forests and works at both national and international levels to
advance sustainable forest management.
</P>
<P>
The program develops and tests innovative approaches such as
private-public partnerships that provide sustainable livelihoods
for people dependent on forestry resources.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP/EC partnership will contribute to the development
cooperation goals of the EC in the areas of forestry and
biodiversity conservation, as well as in capacity building for
improved forestry management.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Supports Export Diversification in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank on Tuesday
announced the approval of a credit totaling 32 million U.S.
dollars for the Bangladesh Export Diversification project that
will help the South Asian country expand the range, depth, and
quantity of exports.
</P>
<P>
The bank said in a statement that the project will help speed
Bangladesh's integration into the world economy by giving the
country's entrepreneurs the know-how they need to gain greater
access to world markets and by making public policies and
institutions more supportive to export needs.
</P>
<P>
The project supports the government of Bangladesh's efforts to
overcome a number of market failures that keep the country's
exporters from realizing their full comparative advantage in the
international marketplace, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The project will provide technical assistance to entrepreneurs
for business planning, product development, and researching new
markets and it will help develop private in-country export support
services.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the project will focus on removing the policy and
institutional constraints on export development and on building
the government's capacity to manage and support trade.
</P>
<P>
To encourage export firms to take the fullest possible
advantage of local and foreign business development services, the
project will establish a Matching Grant Facility. The
12-million-dollar facility is a temporary instrument to actively
encourage the use of business support services to enhance firms'
export capability by providing grants covering 50 percent of the
cost of service fees and associated travel expenses.
</P>
<P>
The project also aims to improve the business environment for
industry and commerce through reforms in trade policy and the
first phase of Customs administration reform. These reforms will
reduce costs now imposed by policy, procedural, and
infrastructure-related impediments.
</P>
<P>
The interest-free credit is provided by the International
Development Association (IDA), the World Bank's concessionary
lending arm, on standard IDA terms with 40 years to maturity and a
10-year grace period.

<HEADLINE> IT Market in China Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, June 1 (Xinhua) -- China's information technology
(IT) market will be valued at 15 billion U.S. dollars by 2000,
when the country is expected to become the largest IT market in
the Asia-Pacific region excluding Japan, said a report released
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report by U.S. market research firm
International Data Corporation (IDC), China is the fastest growing
IT market in Asia with a 1998-2003 compound annual growth rate of
27.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, IDC said, the overall IT market in China reached 9.24
billion U.S. dollars, which enabled China's IT market to surpass
South Korea and become the second largest in the Asia-Pacific
region (excluding Japan). IDC expects China to pull ahead of
Australia and become the largest IT market in the region by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Although China experienced low growth in the last five years,
IDC said, by 2003 the country is expected to represent
approximately one-third of the total IT market in the Asia-Pacific
region, excluding Japan.
</P>
<P>
While hardware tends to overshadow other segments of the
market, IDC said that there has been strong growth in the data
communications equipment, package software and IT services areas.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, hardware accounted for almost 86 percent of China's
total IT market, according to IDC. Data communications equipment,
which represented 8.2 percent of the market, reached 1.175 billion
U.S. dollars, an increase of almost 41 percent over the previous
year, while IT services experienced an increase of 50 percent and
accounted for 5.9 percent of the total market.
</P>
<P>
Finance continued to be the largest vertical industry in China,
accounting for 32.2 percent of total IT spending. This was
followed by telecom and transportation at 18.1 percent and 10.1
percent, respectively.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Ghana Tuesday announced a
15-percent average increase in prices of petroleum products with
immediate effect, the Ghana News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Acting General Manager of the state-run Bulk Oil Storage and
Transport, Kwabena Donkor, said in Accra that the adjustment was
in conformity with price change on the world market and the
country's policy of "import parity" .
</P>
<P>
Donkor said that by April this year, prices of crude oil on the
world market had risen to 15.3 U.S. dollars from 12.64 dollars
last October.
</P>
<P>
The increases now peg ex-pump prices of a liter of premium
petrol at 855. 56 cedis up from 744.44 cedis per liter previously.
 Similarly, a liter of kerosene has shot up to 600 cedis while gas
oil has moved to 822.23 cedis a liter. Liquefied petroleum gas
(LPG) is now sold at 920 cedis per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
On future price adjustment, Donkor said, his company will
review prices on monthly basis to determine the ex-depot
wholesale prices of petroleum products for supply to the oil
marketing companies.
</P>
<P>
The company has adjusted petroleum prices twice downwards
between February, 1997 and October, 1998. (one U.S. dollar equals
2,422 cedis)

<HEADLINE> World Bank Assists Water Sector Reform in Argentina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank on Tuesday
approved a loan of 30 million U.S. dollars for Argentina to
support water sector reform in medium-sized cities.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the project is to support water sector reform
in cities with populations of about 50,000 to 500,000 by
introducing private sector participation in the operation and
management of water utilities, adopting appropriate regulatory
frameworks, and institutionalizing tariff policies and tested
investment alternatives to better reach poor consumers, the bank
said.
</P>
<P>
The reform process expects to put this segment of Argentina's
water and sanitation sector on a sound enough footing to attract
private sector financing, combined with an appropriate role for
the public sector.
</P>
<P>
The loan is on the bank's standard terms for LIBOR-based, U.S.
dollar, single-currency loans, with a maturity of 15 years and
grace period of five years.

<HEADLINE> African Researchers Urged to Tackle Cassava </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Ghana's Deputy Minister of Food and
 Agriculture, J. Asiedu Nketiah, Tuesday urged African researchers
to examine major constraints to strategic planning for developing
cassava as an important food and cash crop.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister made the call at a three-day workshop on
the development of cassava in west and central Africa held in
Accra, the Ghana News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Nketiah identified some of the constraints as lack of improved
varieties to replace local types, poor husbandry practices,
unavailability of planting materials due to low multiplication
ratio. The crop is also bulky and perishable.
</P>
<P>
Other problems are lack of appropriate planting and harvesting
technology to attract medium- and large-scale farmers, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Ghanaian official also called for close collaboration and
coordination of research efforts among international agricultural
research centers and national research and extension systems to
tackle the problems.
</P>
<P>
He noted that cassava, a national diet in many African
countries, has been the main source of many nutrients. It is
produced under various agro- ecological conditions some of which
are unsuitable for many other crops.
</P>
<P>
Africa alone produces 42 percent of the world's cassava, using
principally subsistence agriculture on 10.5 million hectares on
the most marginal lands of the tropics and sub-tropics in 41
countries.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, organized by the United Nations World Food
Organization in collaboration with the International Fund for
Agriculture, is being attended by agriculture researchers from 12
African countries.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Italy Stress NATO Conditions for Bombing Pause </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright Tuesday met Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini as part of a series of meetings with allied leaders aimed at
demonstrate allied unity on NATO demands.
</P>
<P>
The allies differ on the ground troops deployment, a pause in
the bombing campaign against Yugoslavia and targeting of the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign Minister Dini and I... remain committed to concluding
the conflict on the basis of the conditions NATO set and the
international community endorsed," Albright told a joint press
conference.
</P>
<P>
She reiterated that the Serb forces must leave Kosovo so that
the refugees and displaced persons may return safely to their
homes, and an international military presence with NATO at its
core must be established.
</P>
<P>
"In terms of the relationships of the G-8, but as a condition
for the suspension of bombing, the NATO five conditions are what
stand," she noted.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of a pause in the bombing, Dini stressed the same
conditions as Albright did, saying that Belgrade must meet all the
five conditions and the G-8 principles.
</P>
<P>
"If this is not accepted and is not verifiable, then I do not
think that it will be possible for the Alliance to come to
agreement on the suspension of bombing," Dini said.
</P>
<P>
The United States and its allies have given Finnish President
Martti Ahtisaari a detailed plan for Kosovo to put to Belgrade if
he goes on Wednesday, the U.S. State Department said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The plan should enable Ahtisaari, the European Union's Balkan
envoy, to answer any Yugoslav questions such as when an
international peace force would deploy in the province and who
would verify a Yugoslav withdrawal so that NATO bombing can stop,
State Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart also seeks
clarification on how far Yugoslavia was willing to go to satisfy
NATO demands for ending the war over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We are seeking some further clarification," the spokesman
said. "The work that's being done is to understand exactly what
it is that the authorities in Belgrade say they are willing to
agree to."
</P>
<P>
In a letter delivered from Belgrade to German Foreign Minister
Joschka Fischer, Yugoslav officials said they accepted NATO's
principles for a peace settlement and asked for a pause in the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
The letter said that Belgrade will accept "a United Nations
presence, mandate and other elements to be decided by a U.N.
Security Council resolution in accordance with the United Nations
charter."

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia Tuesday reported
a "dramatic increase in civilian casualties" in the Balkan country
in the wake of recent NATO raids.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the Yugoslav Mission to the U.N. said
that more than 50 persons have been killed and more than 100
others wounded in the last 48 hours all over the country as NATO
continued its indiscriminate pounding of Serbia, a Yugoslav
republic.
</P>
<P>
"In certain cities and towns, the clearing away of debris is
still under way, so that it is feared that the number of
casualties could increase," the press release said.
</P>
<P>
As NATO bombing entered 70th day Tuesday, more and more
innocent civilians were killed by the U.S.-led military alliance,
not to mention the NATO violation of the U.N. Charter and
international law.
</P>
<P>
NATO, under the pretext of humanitarianism, staged unilateral air
attacks on Yugoslavia, creating more serious humanitarian crisis
in the country.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leonean Rebels Block ECOMOG Supplying Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leonean rebels Tuesday blocked
a highway serving as a supply route for the west African
peace-keeping force ECOMOG, threatening to undermine a
hardly-earned cease-fire, a report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The road blocks are at Okra Hill, about 60 kilometers from
Sierra Leonean capital Freetown, which is used by the ECOMOG force
backing the government to provide supplies for its troops in the
country's interior areas.
</P>
<P>
The rebels are guarding their blocks with heavy machine guns,
an ECOMOG spokesman was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We have complained to the U.N. Observer Mission in Sierra
Leone and we are waiting patiently to get the rebels to clear the
road blocks," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the ECOMOG may strike in the next few days if
this fails.
</P>
<P>
U.N. sources said their mission was in contact with the rebels
and the rebels have promised to clear the road blocks within 24
hours.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire taking effect on May 24 in a bid to nurture
atmosphere for peace talks held in Togo has been largely
respected, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The talks, jointly brokered by the Economic Community of West
Africa States (ECOWAS) and the United Nations, have made some
progress though the thorny dispute on a transitional government
remains.
</P>
<P>
The rebels suggest that they must share power with President
Tejan Kabbah in a transitional government until a new election is
held, while President Kabbah insists that the rebels must
transform into a political party and compete in the general
election.

NEW YORK, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Global institutional equity
holdings grew 23 percent in 1998 to a value of 14.9 trillion U.S.
dollars, exceeding the 18 percent growth rate a year earlier, a
leading U.S. information company said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Releasing the 1999 International Target Cities Report, the New
York-based Thomson Financial Investor Relations said London and
New York led the top 5 cities in the world, with each city
controlling over 2.0 trillion dollars in equity.
</P>
<P>
They were followed by Boston, Tokyo and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the value of U.S. managers' equity holdings rose
25.3 percent to 8.0 trillion dollars with the U.S. market up 26.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
European managers' equity holdings rose 17 percent to 5.0
trillion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report found that U.S. investors appeared to have moved
funds into Latin and Asian equities, "despite or perhaps because of
weak conditions in those markets", and to have scaled down their
investment in core European markets.

<P>
BONN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Balkans envoys from Russia and the
European Union and senior official from the United States cleared
their eleventh-hour differences over a peace plan to present to
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The envoys, former Russian premier Viktor Chernomyrdin and
Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, were ready to depart for
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said NATO and Russia would send troops to Kosovo
as part of a peacekeeping presence with the United Nations'
approval and support.
</P>
<P>
He said that NATO and Yugoslavia would have to hammer out a
document on the withdrawal of Yugoslav troops from Kosovo so that
NATO would end its bombing.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, there is a realistic chance the war will end,"
Chernomyrdin told reporters. "I think it is now realistic to stop
the bombing of Yugoslavia and this is what I am taking to Belgrade.
"
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during talks near Bonn among
Chernomyrdin, his EU counterpart and Finnish President Ahtisaari
and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott.
</P>
<P>
One major distinction during the negotiations has been the
composition of a peacekeeping force to be deployed in Yugoslavia
after the bombing ends.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Chernomyrdin and Ahtisaari delayed their planned visit
to Belgrade when Talbott introduced several new proposals during
the preparatory talks before the Belgrade trip.

<HEADLINE> Chendu Army Impressive while Sichuan Fo Lan Sluggish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, Anhui, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Sichuan Fo Lan club of China
met with strong challenges from the NEC Blue Rockets of Japan
while another Chinese Club Chendu Army overcame a bad start to a
convincing win on the opening day of the AVC Cup Men's Club
volleyball tournament here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan, boasting four members of the national squad, exerted
every effort to earn a triumph over NEC 25-22, 25-20, 23-25 and25-
21 while Chendu showed their characters and fighting stamina to
score a flying start 25-22, 25-11 and 25-18.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Jian'an, head coach of Sichuan, was not satisfied with the
performance of his side, saying that his spikers did not showed
their true form.
</P>
<P>
"The spikers failed to do a good teamwork with the new setter.
The internationals such as spiker Zhang Xiang, just arrived at
Hefei two days before the begining of the tournament."
</P>
<P>
He was also disappointed with the low mood of the starters in
the third set when they trailed the Japanese who are much shorter
in figure.
</P>
<P>
"They did not show enough characters and fighting stamina in
the third set which they lost," the coach said.
</P>
<P>
Chendu Army stole the light from the not-in-form Sichuan, the
reigning champions of China League, by scoring the biggest gap on
the opeing day.
</P>
<P>
The club, who finished third last season, did not start well as
they trailed 0-5, 6-10, 13-17, under the power game of the
unheralded Al Rayan of Qatar in the first set.
</P>
<P>
Inspired by the partisan crowd, the club, paced by the 37-year-
old setter Yang Liqun, fought back to level the scoring 19-all
before they earned a hard-fought 25-22 first set victory,
</P>
<P>
In the following two sets, they did not allow the Qatar side
back into the rhythm with their speed attack left unanswered.

A spokesman for Pakistan-administered Kashmir told the media
that the educational institutions near the LoC were closed "
because of the deliberate targeting of schools by the Indian army.
"

"Other than being an inhuman act, the firing on the civil
population is also against the U.N. Charter," the spokesman said.

<P>
The envoys, former Russian premier Viktor Chernomyrdin and

Chernomyrdin said NATO and Russia would send troops to Kosovo
as part of a peacekeeping presence with the United Nations'

WASHINGTON -- U.S. President Bill Clinton will announce
Wednesday that the United States is to send 7,000 U.S. ground
troops to Kosovo as part of a peacekeeping force of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
White House officials said that Clinton will make the
announcement during his commencement address at the U.S. Air Force
Academy in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. had planned to send 4,000 troops to the Yugoslav
province as part of a 28,000 force "with NATO at its core," but it
decided to send more after NATO increased the number to 5,0000.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Wednesday, the West and Russia settled last-minute
differences over a Kosovo peace plan that Moscow's Balkan envoy
Viktor Chernomyrdin said provided a "realistic chance" for ending
the war in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said in Bonn both NATO and Russia would send
troops under their own respective command to Kosovo as part of a
peace-keeping operation under United Nations auspices. (US-Kosovo-

<HEADLINE> Pak Army Rules Out Evacuation of Civilian from LoC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has ruled out the
possibility of evacuation of the civilian population living in the
areas close to the Line of Control (LoC) in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"Evacuation is not required at all," as the local residents are
used to face sniper and indiscriminate firing from the Indian
side, and they are not prepared to leave their homes under any
circumstances, a Pakistani Army spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Brig. Rashid Qureshi, director general of the Inter Service
Public Relations, said at a news briefing that the morale of the
defenseless civilians is very high and they are prepared to face
any eventuality.
</P>
<P>
"Come what may, there will be no evacuation," Qureshi said,
adding that women and children may migrate to safer places, but
men will stay at their homes in any case.
</P>
<P>
He referred to a tragic incident which took place on Tuesday
morning, in which seven school children were killed and three
others wounded as a result of Indian artillery and mortar shelling
on a boys school across the LoC in Keran sector.
</P>
<P>
On the protection of the civilian population, Kashmir Affairs
Minister Majeed Malik said on the occasion that the government has
decided to build concrete bunkers along the LoC for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Indian army has stepped up shelling along the
LoC and targeted civilians, killing innocent people.
</P>
<P>
He assured that the government would provide all possible
protection to the civilians and extend financial help to them. The
government, he added, also set up camps and clinics to help the
displaced persons.

<HEADLINE> Pak Condemns Children Killing By Indian Shelling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan on Wednesday condemned
the killing of three more school children by Indian shelling.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly condemned this attempt to target civilian
facilities," said Rafiq Altaf, spokesman for the Foreign Office.
</P>
<P>
According to local media reports, a mortar shell hit a school
once again Wednesday morning in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir when
three children were killed and four others injured.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan had claimed that seven school children were killed by
Indian troops' shelling on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"What is worse, the Indian side denied this crime," said Altaf,
adding that Pakistan will provide documentary evidence for the
killings.
</P>
<P>
He also dismissed the claim that the killings were made "by
mistake." "Targeting schools twice in a row is not a mistake," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reiterated that Pakistan is committed to defusing
the tension in Kashmir, while stressing that his country will
"make all efforts" to defend its sovereignty and territorial
integrity.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to defuse the situation and our peace initiative
and gesture has been highly appreciated by the media," he said,
referring to Pakistan's offer to send its Foreign Minister Sartaj
Aziz to New Delhi for talks on the situation in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The exact date of the proposed visit has yet to be decided,
according to Altaf.

<HEADLINE> Russian, EU Envoys Delay Belgrade Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) mediator on Kosovo
and Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari and his Russian partner
Viktor Chernomyrdin Wednesday delayed their planned visit to
Belgrade and remained here to confer with U.S. Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott in a bid to find common ground on the Kosovo
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin's spokesman Valentin Sergeyev said Talbott had
suggested several new proposals that "were not mentioned earlier."
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin was reportedly still meeting with Ahtisaari and
Talbott. It would be decided after their talks whether Ahtisaari
and Chernomyrdin would fly together to the Yugoslav capital on
Wednesday, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said the three mediators talked long into the
night in an effort to coordinate the EU's, Russia's and the U.S.'s
stands on the Kosovo crisis but failed to reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Talbott told reporters on Tuesday night that the United States'
position on the crisis had not changed.
</P>
<P>
Observers said the failure to iron out the differences between
the three negotiating parties had led to the delay of the Belgrade
trip.
</P>
<P>
The major difference between Russia and the United States
reportedly lies in the fact that the U.S. insists on Belgrade's
withdrawal of troops from Kosovo as the precondition for a halt to
bombing while Russia could not accept it.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
on Wednesday urged that more steps be taken to reach a peaceful
solution to the current crisis over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In an airport statement before his departure for Cologne,
Germany, to attend the European Union (EU) summit which opens
Thursday, Simitis said the peace initiative by the seven Western
countries and Russia for a solution to the Yugoslav crisis was in
progress.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the peace process would fall into line and more steps
would be made in that direction.
</P>
<P>
"We will insist on an agreement as soon as possible," the
premier stressed.

<P>
In a related development, Greek government spokesman Yiannis
Nikolaou confirmed Wednesday that U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright had called her Greek counterpart George
Papandreou n Sunday night and requested communication with
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
He said that Papandreou also contacted Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic and Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic who
expressed the view that a solution was possible based on the peace
proposal by the seven Western countries and Russia, known as the
Group of Eight.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Greece discerned a "positive direction
and preconditions" for a solution to the Yugoslav crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of Greece (KKE) Secretary-General Aleka
Papariga warned Wednesday that the Balkan region had entered a

LANZHOU, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The State Bureau of Foreign Experts
Affairs plans to award 100 foreign experts with a "Friendship
Prize" for their outstanding services to China before the Chinese
National Day this year.
</P>
<P>
"More than 1,000 foreign experts will be invited to attend this
year's national day reception," said Zhang Yujie, deputy-director
of the State Bureau of Foreign Experts Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The system of making awards to foreign experts in China began
in the 1950s, when most of the prizes went to Russian and East
European experts. Since the reform and opening-up policy was
launched in 1978, more foreign experts from a wide range of
countries have come to work in China and by the end of 1998 a
total of 740,000 had come from more than 50 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The "Friendship Prize" has already been presented to 420
foreign experts since it was established in 1991 under the
approval of the State council.

HANGZHOU, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The world's first tidal power
station will be built in the Zhoushan islands area of east coastal
China's Zhejiang Province, the Zhejiang Provincial Bureau of

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Denies Help to Turkish Rebel Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Wednesday categorically
dismissed reports that it had helped the Turkish outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
"The Cyprus Republic is innocent of any accusation Mr Ocalan is
reported to have made," Cyprus' Government Spokesman Costas
Serezis said.
</P>
<P>
According to Turkish media, the Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan, who is being tried in Turkey, told the Court that the PKK
had received help from Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Ankara Security Court No. 2 on Monday started the
trial of Ocalan on charges of treason on the Imrali Island near
Turkey's western province of Bursa.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions by the presiding judge of the trial,
Ocalan listed Syria, Greece, Cyprus, Iran, Iraq, Yugoslavia,
Armenia, Britain, Greek Orthodox Church and some others as
countries or organizations that had help the PKK.
</P>
<P>
Serezis said, "Ocalan's reported allegations may be related to
possible activity by individuals."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday the Primate of the Greek Orthodox Church of
Cyprus Archbishop Chrysostomos also dismissed claims that the
Cyprus Church had offered financial assistance to the PKK.
</P>
<P>
He said he was "surprised to hear this report, because nothing
of the kind had even happened".
</P>
<P>
The PKK, led by Ocalan, has been fighting a 15-year-long war
for an independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey, which has
claimed over 37,000 lives since August 1984.

<HEADLINE> HK District Council Electoral Procedure Spelt Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Electoral Affairs
Commission has laid down a regulation on the procedure for the
District Councils election in November.
</P>
<P>
This includes the publication of a voter register, the
nomination of candidates, polling arrangements and the counting of
ballots.
</P>
<P>
Justice Woo Kwok-hing, chairman of the commission, said at a
press conference Wednesday: "Voting will be made simpler. Chops
bearing the mark of a 'tick' will be provided at every polling
station for electors to mark their ballot paper."
</P>
<P>
"Just use the chop to stamp a 'tick' in the circle opposite the
name of the candidate of your choice" instead of using a pen or
other means to mark the ballot. Otherwise, the vote will be
invalid, he said.
</P>
<P>
In light of public concern about the privacy of personal data,
he said only the name, address and constituency of an elector will
be published for public inspection. Their identity card number and
sex will not be made public, he said.
</P>
<P>
The regulation was drawn up after the commission considered all
the public views received during a public consultation exercise on
its proposed electoral guidelines between April 12 and May 11.
</P>
<P>
A total of 28 written representations were received and 15
persons addressed the commission at a public forum.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines will be finalized after the regulation goes
through the Legislative Council and will be issued in September.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Intends to Bid for Asian Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the Sports
Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China (SF&AMP;OC) said
here on Wednesday that Hong Kong had a mind to bid for the 2006
Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to bid for the Asian Games," said SF&AMP;OC President
Timothy Fok Tsun-ting.
</P>
<P>
"If we fail to bid for the 2006 Asian Games, we will try again
bidding for the 2010 Asian Games," added Pang Chung, secretary
general of SF&AMP;OC.
</P>
<P>
Timothy Fok said he had confidence in Hong Kong because it has
a more advanced communication and economic circumstances than
Macao and Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Macao has clinched the right to host the East Asian Games in
2005 and Bangkok held the 13th Asian Games successively despite
the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
But Timothy Fok added that the toughest problem for Hong Kong's
bid was the lack of a multi-functional sport complex.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Hong Kong would have an advanced sports
complex with the help from the Hong Kong government who could
allocate land for the complex.

<HEADLINE> URGENT: PLA Air Force Rescues Sick French Tourist (More Added) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GOLMUD (QINGHAI), June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special Chinese People's
Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force jet was scrambled this afternoon
to fly to the rescue of a French traveler who suddenly fell
seriously ill while touring the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and brought
the elderly tourist back to Beijing for urgent treatment.
</P>
<P>
Jean Escalon, 63, from Grenoble in France, arrived in China on
May 24 in the company of his nephew and traveled to the city of
Golmud on May 31, which is 2,800 meters above sea level in
northwest China's Qinghai Province. The two had plans to bicycle
to Lhasa, the capital of southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Escalon felt a sudden pain in his lower right
back and was immediately sent to a nearby hospital where he was
initially diagnosed as suffering from renal colic resulting from
kidney stones.
</P>
<P>
"The illness was caused by overwork, lack of oxygen and drinks
during his journey," explained Cui Guohua, the hospital head. "The
stones have existed in the patient's kidney for some time though
they have never caused renal colic before," he added.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the hospital's efforts, Escalon was still in acute
pain, so his nephew, Fedirec Cancel, called the Beijing Office of
the AEA (Asia Emergency Assistance) International PTE Ltd.,
appealing for help.
</P>
<P>
"Upon receiving the phone call, we asked China's PLA air force
to help and within half an hour they had agreed," said Cui Heping,
a senior consultant of the Singapore-based AEA.
</P>
<P>
"I never expected that you could have got here from Beijing
less than 36 hours since I made the rescue request," Cancel told a
Chinese doctor who came here with the special plane.
</P>
<P>
The plane, whose chief pilot Colonel Zhou Guoqing has nearly 5,
000 hours of flying experience, left the airport in the western
suburbs of Beijing at 09:10 today and arrived in Golmud at 12:15
after a flight of 2,000 km.
</P>
<P>
When the plane arrived, two AEA doctors rushed to the hospital
for a thorough medical check-up of the patient and make the
necessary preparations for the transfer.
</P>
<P>
After enduring serious pain and eating nothing for two days,
Escalon was pale and weak in the emergency room of the hospital,
and the pain had spread to his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
"If the illness worsens, the patient will suffer from infection
and kidney exhaustion. A transfer to a Beijing hospital where the
most modern facilities are available is the best option," decided
Yang Wen, an AEA doctor.
</P>
<P>
At 14:10 today, Escalon was carried on board the special plane
which left the plateau for Beijing 20 minutes later. Escalon will
be taken to the International Clinic attached to the AEA.
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time that China's Air Force has sent
special planes to pick up foreign nationals who become seriously
ill in remote places. The AEA Beijing Office says it organizes 100
first aid flights every year, with nearly 40 of them by the PLA's
air force.
</P>
<P>
The special plane carrying the French patient arrived in
Beijing at 17:00 today and an ambulance of the AEA first-aid
center rushed Escalon to the International Clinic attached to the
AEA, which boasts first-class medical apparatus and more than 30
highly experienced Chinese and foreign doctors.
</P>
<P>
When asked about his condition, Escalon said: "I'm OK," smiling.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to offer Escalon a conservative treatment. If
necessary, we will use lasers to destroy the kidney stones," said
Cui Heping, an AEA doctor.
</P>
<P>
"When Escalon recovers, we are going to abandon our jpournay
plan and return to our home in Grenoble of France. We will come to
China again when there is a chance," said Escalon's nephew
Fradirec Cancel.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Nuclear Scientists Refute Cox Report (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Cox Report dished out by the U.
S. Congress is, in the eyes of Chinese nuclear scientists who have
participated in developing China's nuclear weapons, "nothing but
rumors fabricated out of thin air and brazen lies".
</P>
<P>
Dong Ying, 66, an expert in nuclear fuel, still has a clear
memory of the creative work of Chinese scientists in developing
nuclear weapons in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
"The United States imposed strict sanctions upon New China (
founded in 1949), and experts from the former Soviet Union, who
were then partners of Chinese scientists, were called back
overnight," Dong said, "All of us became strong immediately and
determined to bring credit to the Chinese people."
</P>
<P>
China independently developed and manufactured its own nuclear
weapons arsenal of atomic bombs and H-bombs within that very
special climate.
</P>
<P>
"As a matter of fact, it was impossible and unnecessary for
Chinese scientists to have 'stolen' the U.S. technology of the
1950s to develop missiles, as the Cox Report tried to charge,"
Dong said, shaking with anger.
</P>
<P>
Yu Min, 73, an academician of China's top natural sciences
research body of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), said that
China decided at the very beginning to develop its own nuclear
weapons by its own efforts.
</P>
<P>
China's first atomic bomb was detonated in 1964, followed by
the creation of its first H-bomb two years later.
</P>
<P>
"China has created a world record in terms of its speed in
developing the bombs," said Yu, who is also a research fellow with
the Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Chinese scientists see the Cox Report as an open slander
against Chinese scientists and other Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"It indeed devalues our capability and our devotion to our
careers and country," Dong said, "I believe U.S. scientists who
are honest and trust the facts would not deny this."
</P>
<P>
Yu noted that Chinese scientists gained their surprising
achievements over four decades by entirely employing their wisdom,
unity, and devotion to their motherland.
</P>
<P>
"It was naturally obvious that we would reach the current level
of development in our nuclear industry since the overall national
strength of China has been increasing after more than two decades
of the reform and opening up drive," Yu said.
</P>
<P>
"What we've achieved reflects the wisdom of the Chinese nation
and its spirit of self-dependence," he said, "It is very strange
that the United States would 'chase the wind and clutch at
shadows', meaning to speak or act on hearsay evidence, when it got
to know what level we are at now."
</P>
<P>
Yu pointed out that the arrogance and hegemonism of the United
States were again exposed to the public. It also showed that some
politicians in the United States were deliberately ruining Sino-U.
S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Renkai, a bi-academician of the CAS and the Chinese
Academy of Engineering (CAE), said that the reason China developed
advanced national defense technology was to safeguard national
security and world peace.
</P>
<P>
"The lesson we must bear in mind is that one could come under
attack if it was less developed," said Zhao, an expert in nuclear
submarines.
</P>
<P>
On whether the normal exchanges between Chinese and U.S.
scientists would be affected, Zhao said that it might have some
temporary impact, but people who were true scientific researchers
would not believe the groundless lies.
</P>
<P>
"The basic understanding is that exchanges benefit the overall
development of human beings," Zhao said, "And lies never last long.

<HEADLINE> Fund-Raising Setup Urged for Defence Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- As a matter of urgency China should
quickly set up a multi-channel fund-raising mechanism for the
research and development of defence-oriented high technology,
according to specialists.
</P>
<P>
The call for action came from delegates to a symposium on
scientific inventions, risk investment and defence construction
which was attended by more than 30 experts from the military,
government departments, the People's bank of China and research
institutions.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that in the wake of the U.S.-led NATO
attacking on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, significant changes
have taken place in both the international and domestic political
and economic situation and that the Chinese government should
seize this opportunity to take timely measures to boost national
defence, and set up more channels to raise funds for the research
and development of defence-oriented high technologies.
</P>
<P>
They said that this will also provide many job opportunities
for the country at present.
</P>
<P>
In the present era of knowledge-based economy, the delegates
said, the research and development of military high technologies
needed by modern national defence will serve as a great impetus to
the growth of the overall economy.

<HEADLINE> APEC Investment Fair Opens in Seoul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The "APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation) Investment Mart 1999" opens here with the attendance
of some 2,500 representatives from across the world.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the opening of the fair, President Kim said
the event, the first of its kind in the world, will be a trigger
to attract much more foreign investors into the Asia-Pacific
region by announcing economic recovery to the world and by
enhancing its international credibility.
</P>
<P>
The APEC Investment Mart will serve as the momentum for the
strengthening of economic ties among the APEC members themselves
and between the nations of the region and other countries around
the world, said Kim.
</P>
<P>
"The Asian economy has emerged from the depths of the foreign
currency crisis, however, and its vitality will soon be fully
restored. Asia has resolutely changed the weak economic factors
that invited the crisis and has high hopes for a new leap forward
based on strong self-confidence," the South Korean president said.
</P>
<P>
The four-day fair featuring 1,448 investment projects from 21
members of APEC is the first one held in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The 21 APEC members set up their own booths occupying 300
square meters each at Seoul Convention and Exhibition Center.
</P>
<P>
The fair was proposed by President Kim Dae-jung in the 6th
summit of APEC members last November in Kuala Lumpur to
facilitate investment in the region.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Parliamentarian Resigns Over Fraud Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 2 (Xinhua)-- Singapore Parliamentarian Choo Wee
Khiang resigned after pleading guilty to a cheating charge, the
Office of the Clerk of Parliament announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Choo, representing the constituency of Jalan Besar, had been
charged with assisting another man, said to be a close family
friend of him, to cheat a finance company 830,000 Singapore
dollars (about 488,235 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The judge has mitigated the charge from aggravated to simple
cheating and will make the sentence next Monday.
</P>
<P>
A court official said that Choo had taken a wrong turn, and
that he and the man could have easily obtained financing in a
proper way through a mortgage loan, if they had consulted a
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
The Parliament's announcement said Choo, first elected as an MP
in 1988, submitted earlier Wednesday his resignation letter to the
Speaker.
</P>
<P>
"Choo therefore ceases to be an elected Member of Parliament
from the time of receipt of his letter," said the statement.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Former Djiboutian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- China truly values its traditional
friendship with Djibouti and is ready to make joint efforts to
further strengthen the long-term, stable relations and cooperation,
President Jiang Zemin told visiting former president Hassan Gouled
Aptidon here today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang welcomed Gouled, on his second visit to China, and
expressed satisfaction for the efforts Gouled made on improving
Sino-Djiboutian relations during his term of office.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the bilateral relations and cooperation
have developed smoothly since the two countries established
diplomatic ties 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that China has always held that a country, big
or small, should be treated as equal, and both China and Djibouti
are developing countries, thus the further enhancement of their
unity and cooperation will conform to the joint fundamental
interests.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president also praised Djibouti's achievements in
domestic construction and its positive role in safeguarding peace
and stability in the Horn of Africa, and expressed his hope that
newly elected President Ismael Omar Guelleh would lead the people
to achieve new success with the support of Gouled.
</P>
<P>
Gouled said that he is here to visit old friends and expressed
gratitude to the Chinese government and people for their support
of his country over a long period.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the friendship between Djibouti and China is
rooted in the hearts of the Djiboutians, and he will continue to
further promote relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi attended the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan has announced its gross domestic product grew
by only 0.6 percent in 1998, a drop of 1.5 percent compared with
1997.
</P>
<P>
In a note addressed to the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
published in Wednesday's local press, the Jordanian government
said the drop in economic activities particularly centered in the
agricultural and construction sectors.
</P>
<P>
MUSCAT -- An Omani-Yemeni commercial bank will soon be opened
in Sanaa, with the Omani side contributing 30 percent of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's Arab daily "Al Hayat" quoted the deputy chairman of
the Yemeni Chamber of Commerce and Industry Mohamed Hassan Al
Zobeiri, who is currently visiting Oman, as saying the opening of
the bank will crown bilateral economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He indicated the two countries were contemplating the
establishment of a joint navigation company as another aspect of
bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The monthly bulletin issued by the custom house
of Abu Dhabi revealed the volume of non-petroleum foreign trade of
the Emirate of Abu Dhabi in April amounted to about 556 million
U.S. dollars, of which imports stood at 518 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The bulletin said Japan ranked the first among the
emirate's trading partners in the field of imports with 107
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the emirate's exports, Canada ranked first with
6 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- A study worked out by the Saudi consultative services
on the sugar industry estimates that the sugar needs in Saudi
Arabia will rise to 742,000 tons in the year 2006.
</P>
<P>
Printed in Wednesday's local press, the study said that despite
the united sugar company production of 515,000 tons of refined
sugar, Saudi Arabia still imported up to 554,000 tons last year.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- An agreement was signed here by Jordanian and Japanese
companies, whereby the latter would allocate 10 million dollars to
finance the former's emergency water program for this summer as
announced last April.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to purchase 20 water tanks and pumps, 30
pumping transformers and pipes, and water from private well owners
and to finance the drilling of twenty new wells, to help meet the
needs of citizens particularly in the capital governorate.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The net profit of Israel's five major banks for
the first quarter of 1999 reached 763 million shekels (about 186
million U.S. dollars), an increase of 18 percent over last year's
first quarter figure of 647 million shekels (about 158 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The growth was attributed to declining inflation, continued
appreciation of the shekels and the banks' efforts to upgrade
their efficiency in the period, according to economists.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's biggest telephone company Bezeq lost 29.2
million shekels (about 7.12 million dollars) in the first quarter,
after having allocated 275 million shekels (about 67 million
dollars) for a reorganization program in the year 2000, which
includes 500-600 layoffs.
</P>
<P>
Bezeq officials said the continuing freeze of the company's
privatization also harms its business management. They expressed
hope that the privatization process would resume soon, before full
competition in the domestic telecommunications market is permitted.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Syrian Oil Company has renewed an agreement with
an Egyptian oil prospection company for drilling 75 exploratory
wells, Egyptian Oil Minister Hamdi el-Banbi said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
El-Banbi told reporters that the biggest international tender
for developing oil fields in Syria has also been awarded to the
Egyptian oil company, Enpi.
</P>
<P>
The minister added three Egyptian private companies are working
in Syria's oil sector and 120 Syrian engineers and technicians
have completed training courses in Egypt in the oil industry.

<HEADLINE> New U.S. Proposals Delay Envoys' Trip to Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The planned trip to Belgrade by
Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin and Finnish President Martti
Ahtisaari was delayed Wednesday when the United States came up
with new proposals "partially unacceptable for Russia," Russian
media reports said.
</P>
<P>
The new proposals, which had not been coordinated and written
down earlier in the talks in Bonn between Chernomyrdin, Ahtisaari,
who acts as EU envoy, and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott, prompted the three sides to continue their negotiations
in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
A decision on whether Ahtisaari and Chernomyrdin should depart
for Belgrade will depend on the outcome of the talks, the Interfax
news agency reported from Bonn, quoting Chernomyrdin's adviser
Valentin Sergeyev.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin, Ahtisaari and Talbott negotiated without their
delegations at noon, Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
The departure was delayed because the United States made new
proposals with "tougher conditions for Belgrade, some of which are
unacceptable for Russia, the mediator in the talks," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Moves to Further Boost B Share Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- New measures to make the issue of B
shares by Chinese enterprises easier, in a bid to further boost
the B share market, have been announced today.
</P>
<P>
A circular issued by the China Securities Regulatory Commission
(CSRC) said that besides state-owned enterprises, now collectively-
owned and other forms of enterprises can apply for the issue of B
shares.
</P>
<P>
The CSRC also canceled the pre-qualification system under which
enterprises have to be approved in batches on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, applications would be reviewed and
approved in separate cases.
</P>
<P>
Though there are no written regulations prohibiting non-state-
owned enterprises from issuing B shares, analysts here said such a
rule has been actually practiced. They said the new measures mark
a positive change in the government's policy.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, the government has approved 107 B shares. But the
market has been in a sustained slump in recent years, causing
grave concern over its future among investors.
</P>
<P>
Senior CSRC sources have on different occasions expressed the
government's determination to revitalize the market.
</P>
<P>
The securities market watchdog last Friday announced the cut of
stamp tax over B share trading from 0.4 percent to 0.3 percent, as
from Monday, in its first attempt to save the market.
</P>
<P>
The B share market has recorded heavy gains in the last week,
mainly driven by bullish sentiments in the A share market.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Urges Israeli PM-Elect to Announce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian official said Wednesday
the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) expects the new Israeli
government to announce its policy regarding the expansion of
Jewish settlements initiated by the outgoing Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
PNA Minister of Local Government Saeb Erekat said the
Palestinian authority hopes Israeli prime minister-elect Ehud
Barak and his new cabinet to take a clear stand on the settlement
issue to re-activate the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In statements broadcast by Voice of Palestine radio on
Wednesday, Erakat asserted the peace process requires a cessation
of all Jewish settlement activities in the Israeli-occupied
territories, as well as the implementation of the Wye River accord.
</P>
<P>
Erakat, the chief Palestinian negotiator with Israel, also
renewed the PNA's demand that Barak and his future cabinet
abolish all settlement plans.
</P>
<P>
The number of Israeli settlements in the West Bank has exceeded
170 whereas the number of settlers is well over 170,000 by the end
of 1998, according to statistics released by the Israeli Bureau of
Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from Israel on Tuesday said Barak and his
future cabinet may adopt a policy regarding settlements which will
allow the development of natural resources and the expansion of
existing settlements but prohibit the establishment of new ones.

<HEADLINE> Editorial: China Upholds Independent Foreign Policy of Peace (Part 1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Thursday issue of People's
Daily, China's leading newspaper, will carry an editorial entitled
"Unswervingly Upholding Independent Foreign Policy of Peace".
</P>
<P>
The editorial says the U.S.-led NATO attack on the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade was a serious invasion of China's sovereignty
and a major challenge to China's independent foreign policy of
peace.
</P>
<P>
It points out that the Central Committee of the Communist Party
of China (CPC), with Jiang Zemin at the core, rapidly and properly
tackled this major issue, which indicated China's firm stand on
maintaining peace and against hegemonism.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin again stressed at a meeting for welcoming
diplomatic personnel from the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia that
China will continue to unswervingly uphold its independent foreign
policy of peace.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says Jiang's remarks are a guideline for handling
China's foreign affairs at the turn of this century.
</P>
<P>
The article says peace and development are two major issues
today. However, neither of them has been solved.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO has been advocating such fallacies as "state
sovereignty is not as important as human rights" and "limited
sovereignty" and it has been trying to violate the principle of
non-interference in other countries' internal affairs and lay "
theoretical" foundations for interference in other countries'
affairs and invasion of other countries.
</P>
<P>
China believes that a country, small or large, should be
treated equally and its sovereignty and integrity of territory
should be respected.

<HEADLINE> Editorial: China Upholds Independent Foreign Policy of Peace (Part 2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The editorial points out that it is an important part of
China's independent foreign policy of peace to fight against
hegemonism and power politics.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S.-led NATO attack on the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade showed that hegemonism and power politics are major
threats to world peace.
</P>
<P>
In dealing with international affairs, the editorial says,
China has to decide its own stand and policy on the basis of the
fundamental interests of the Chinese people and people in other
countries of the world, without caring about the attitudes of
other countries.
</P>
<P>
China will firmly struggle against hegemonism and work for
maintaining world peace without fear of pressure.
</P>
<P>
The article says, "Upholding the independent foreign policy of
peace also covers promoting friendly cooperation with Western
countries including the United States.
</P>
<P>
"So long as they are willing to implement the Five Principles
of Peaceful Coexistence, China is ready to establish cooperative
relations in various fields with them."
</P>
<P>
The development trend of the Sino-U.S. relations, the editorial
says, is of great importance to the whole world. Though the
improvement and development of the Sino-U.S. ties has experienced
ups and downs and there are anti-China forces in the United States,
the vast number of the American people believe in having friendly
ties with China.
</P>
<P>
China will oppose hegemonism while promoting ties with the
United States and this act indicates China's firm stance, its
flexibility in handling foreign affairs as well as its maturity
and confidence in its relations with other countries.
</P>
<P>
The editorial emphasizes that under the CPC Central Committee's
leadership with Jiang Zemin at the core, China will hold higher
the banner of an independent foreign policy of peace and make
greater contributions to the maintaining of the sovereignty and
dignity of the Chinese nation, the noble undertakings of world
peace and the development of mankind.

TEHRAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
on Wednesday called for "national will" to recover the country's
ailing economy by boosting production and exports.
</P>
<P>
The national economy is in need of serious and basic evolution,
Khatami said at the inauguration ceremony of a center for export

</P>
<P>
The Iranian president cited investment and production as main
factors for the promotion of exports.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> URGENT: PLA Air Force Rescues Sick French Tourist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GOLMUD (QINGHAI), June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special Chinese People's
Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force jet was scrambled this afternoon
to fly to the rescue of a French traveler who suddenly fell
seriously ill while touring the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and brought
the elderly tourist back to Beijing for urgent treatment.
</P>
<P>
Jean Escalon, 63, from Grenoble in France, arrived in China on
May 24 in the company of his nephew and traveled to the city of
Golmud on May 31, which is 2,800 meters above sea level in
northwest China's Qinghai Province. The two had plans to bicycle
to Lhasa, the capital of southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Escalon felt a sudden pain in his lower right
back and was immediately sent to a nearby hospital where he was
initially diagnosed as suffering from renal colic resulting from
kidney stones.
</P>
<P>
"The illness was caused by overwork, lack of oxygen and drinks
during his journey," explained Cui Guohua, the hospital head. "The
stones have existed in the patient's kidney for some time though
they have never caused renal colic before," he added.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the hospital's efforts, Escalon was still in acute
pain, so his nephew, Fedirec Cancel, called the Beijing Office of
the AEA (Asia Emergency Assistance) International PTE Ltd.,
appealing for help.
</P>
<P>
"Upon receiving the phone call, we asked China's PLA air force
to help and within half an hour they had agreed," said Cui Heping,
a senior consultant of the Singapore-based AEA.
</P>
<P>
"I never expected that you could have got here from Beijing
less than 36 hours since I made the rescue request," Cancel told a
Chinese doctor who came here with the special plane.
</P>
<P>
The plane, whose chief pilot Colonel Zhou Guoqing has nearly 5,
000 hours of flying experience, left the airport in the western
suburbs of Beijing at 09:10 today and arrived in Golmud at 12:15
after a flight of 2,000 km.
</P>
<P>
When the plane arrived, two AEA doctors rushed to the hospital
for a thorough medical check-up of the patient and make the
necessary preparations for the transfer.
</P>
<P>
After enduring serious pain and eating nothing for two days,
Escalon was pale and weak in the emergency room of the hospital,
and the pain had spread to his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
"If the illness worsens, the patient will suffer from infection
and kidney exhaustion. A transfer to a Beijing hospital where the
most modern facilities are available is the best option," decided
Yang Wen, an AEA doctor.
</P>
<P>
At 14:10 today, Escalon was carried on board the special plane
which left the plateau for Beijing 20 minutes later. Escalon will
be taken to the International Clinic attached to the AEA.
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time that China's Air Force has sent
special planes to pick up foreign nationals who become seriously
ill in remote places. The AEA Beijing Office says it organizes 100
first aid flights every year, with nearly 40 of them by the PLA's
air force.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will issue
some 75 million U.S. dollars worth of privatization bonds before
the end of the year, the proceeds of which could be used to fund
the projected 875 million U.S. dollar deficit in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Sources of the Central Bank of the Philippines said on
Wednesday that the privatization certificates would give investors
the right to purchase shares in companies privatized after the
launch of the issue.
</P>
<P>
Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu was quoted as saying that
the privatization bonds also present an opportunity for smaller
investors to acquire government bonds.
</P>
<P>
If the government gets adequate funds from the bonds, it may no
longer have to borrow funds to finance the projected 875 million
U.S. dollar deficit next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The bonds would have a maturity of five years, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
said on Wednesday the European Union envoy to Yugoslavia, Finnish
President Martti Ahtisaari, could travel alone on a peace mission
to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
"Neither he nor we have excluded the possibility that at some
point it might be appropriate for him to go alone," Cook told
reporters at a daily briefing on the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
Cook said the decision on whether to make the trip must be made
by Ahtisaari himself but that the Finnish president had Britain's
wholehearted support whatever he decided to do.
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari previously planned to make a trip to Belgrade with
Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin. But their departure was put
off while a new round of talks was held in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
An Itar-Tass report said earlier that the talks failed to reach
an agreement on a joint position regarding Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and
Ahtisaari have been in Bonn trying to agree on a position on
Kosovo since Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Cook said Ahtisaari obviously felt he was close to agreement
with Chernomyrdin on a possible peace formula to take to Belgrade
together -- otherwise the two men would not have continued talks
on Wednesday in Bonn.

<HEADLINE> China Developing Third-Generation Mobile Telecom System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese version of the third-
generation of mobile telecommunications system, called IMT-2000,
is being developed by the China Research Institute of Mobile
Telecommunications Science and Technology with the approval of the
Ministry of Information Industry.
</P>
<P>
Headed by Yang Yigang, the research body's experts are seeking
ways to perfect their technological plans, while actively
participating in the international efforts to unify the different
standards of the systems.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that the global sales of mobile telephones
will reach 500 billion to one trillion U.S. dollars by 2010, and
most international telecom giants are sparing no effort in
developing their own systems, in order to secure bigger shares of
the market by incorporating more of their technical standards into
the global one in the making.
</P>
<P>
In June last year, China submitted a technical standard
proposal (TD-SCDMA) to the International Telecommunication Union (
ITU) in an attempt to gain a position in the future
standardization procedures related to IMT-2000.
</P>
<P>
Most of the international telecom giants have also reached a
consensus to support the proposal. Once taken, Chinese
manufacturing enterprises will have opportunities to enter the
world market.
</P>
<P>
China supports the convergence of different standards for third-
generation mobile phones and plans to commercialize the system
between the years 2002 and 2003, an Information Industry Ministry
official said.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to standardize technologies related with third-
generation mobile telecommunications system, the ITU started
evaluating various standards in 1985 and had received 15 different
proposals by last June.
</P>
<P>
China, with the world largest mobile phone market potential,
plays a key role in the standardization drive.
</P>
<P>
However, the ITU failed to reach a uniform set of standards
because of various interests represented by world telecom giants.
</P>
<P>
The typical candidate standards are the Wideband-Code Division
Multiple Access W-CDMA favored by European and Japanese companies,
and the CDMA2000 supported by North American companies.

<HEADLINE> EU Leaders To Focus On War in Balkans During Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the 15 European Union (
EU) member states will meet in Cologne, Germany, on Thursday and
Friday for a European Council that is expected to focus on the war
in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders will be discussing in depth the situation in the
Balkan nation. EU foreign ministers plan to debate a joint
strategy for a lasting peace in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
They will discuss the results of a visit to Belgrade by the EU
envoy, Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, who has been entrusted
with a mandate to go to Belgrade on behalf of the EU on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari met with Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin, U.S.
Assistant Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, and German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder in Bonn on Tuesday to discuss aspects of his
Belgrade mission. He is expected to be accompanied by
Chernomyrdin on this peace mission.
</P>
<P>
EU sources said the Bonn meeting would ensure that conditions
set by NATO have indeed been met. According to the German
government, the Finnish president will not be going to Belgrade to
negotiate but to present Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
with a set of NATO demands.
</P>
<P>
The EU Summit will mark the end of Germany's six-month-long EU
presidency. Finland will take over the rotating presidency on
July 1. In a letter dated May 31 to EU leaders, Schroeder invited
his counterparts to "once again enhance the capacity of the
European Union, and the effectiveness and legitimacy of its joint
action to bring it even closer to the citizens."
</P>
<P>
"This is a "sine qua non" for the enlargement of the European
Union," Schroeder said in the letter. The crisis in the Balkans
merely served to underpin the need for joint action at the
forthcoming European Council in Cologne, he added.

HONG KONG, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the Sports
Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China (SF&AMP;OC) said
here on Wednesday that Hong Kong had a mind to bid for the 2006
Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to bid for the Asian Games," said SF&AMP;OC President
Timothy Fok Tsun-ting.
</P>
<P>
"If we fail to bid for the 2006 Asian Games, we will try again
bidding for the 2010 Asian Games," added Pang Chung, secretary
general of SF&AMP;OC.

Timothy Fok said he had confidence in Hong Kong because it has

Macao and Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Macao has clinched the right to host the East Asian Games in
2005 and Bangkok held the 13th Asian Games successively despite
the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
But Timothy Fok added that the toughest problem for Hong Kong's
bid was the lack of a multi-functional sport complex.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Hong Kong would have an advanced sports
complex with the help from the Hong Kong government who could
allocate land for the complex.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Exports Fall by 9 Percent in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Romania's exports fell by 9
percent in the first quarter of 1999, compared with the same
period of last year, the local Nine O'clock daily reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"This figure represents the most important fall of exports in
the past 10 years," the newspaper quoted Mihai Ionescu, executive
secretary of the National Association of Exporters and Importers
of Romania, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Trade deficit in the first three months was 418.1 million U.S.
dollars as against 435.1 million dollars in the same period of
last year, but this occurred against the background of a
considerable decrease of both exports and imports.
</P>
<P>
The drastic drop of exports, explained by the low
competitiveness of Romanian products and the loss of some
traditional markets, led to decreased imports, while 80 percent of
exports rely on imported raw materials.
</P>
<P>
Imports in the first quarter was 2,282.3 million dollars, a
drop of 8.1 percent from the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Committee for Statistics, the
newspaper said that the most significant decreases in exports this
year were chemicals, foodstuffs, drinks, tobacco, pig iron, iron
and steel, cars, tractors and other motor vehicles. Significant
import decreases were registered by fuel, mineral oils and organic
chemicals.

It is a widely used practice for high-ranking officials to
publish congratulatory messages or advertisement in newspapers.
</P>
<P>
But while expressing appreciation for the felicitations and
goodwill conveyed through such messages by individuals and
corporate bodies to his administration, Okupe said the president
"believes as a matter of personal principle and style that such
practice is not only wasteful, but also borders on sycophancy."
</P>
<P>
The newly sworn-in president pledged in his inauguration speech
on May 29 that he will have anti corruption as a main focus for
his administration.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Govt Beefs Up Force in S. State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The government has urgently deployed
150 more soldiers to the troubled Warri area in Nigeria's southern
oil rich Delta State as conflict there had taken a death toll of
more than 200.
</P>
<P>
Delta State Governor James Ibori also held an urgent meeting
Tuesday with leaders of Ijaw, Itsekiri, and Urhobo, the three main
ethnic groups in Warri region.
</P>
<P>
Four soldiers were feared dead apart from the about 200
civilian death toll.
</P>
<P>
Militant Ijaw youths Monday torched the entire Itsekiri
dominant village of Aroton, including two primary and one
secondary schools, reported The Guardian, a major Nigerian paper,
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The youth started their assault early Monday morning after
disarming security personnel in a nearby camp. Aroton village was
located in Warri southwest local government area of Delta State.
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere in the oil rich region was extremely tense when
Itsekiri youths are expected to fight back in retaliation.
</P>
<P>
Although Delta governor pledged his support for the agitation
by the youths for better stake in the national resources located
in their communities, he condemned the use of violence.
</P>
<P>
The trouble was triggered when tax collectors from the two
council areas, which are in a hot debate over the ownership of the
area, are on their revenue drives one week ago.
</P>
<P>
Warri area is traditionally a headache for the state as well as
federal government, for the local ethnic communities are
constantly fighting against each other and the government on
division of land and oil benefit.

<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin told
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov that the development of the
coordinated China-Russia strategic partnership is not only in the
fundamental interest of the two peoples but also beneficial to
world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remark during his meeting with Ivanov at the
Diaoyutai State Guesthouse here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Jiang first asked Ivanov to convey his regards to Russian
President Boris Yeltsin. "The Chinese government and people is
expecting President Yeltsin to visit China again this autumn," the
Chinese leader said.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that the current Sino-Russian ties have witnessed
smooth growth with frequent exchanges and cooperation spreading in
all fields, adding that China is willing to make concerted efforts
with Russia for further development of such relationships.
</P>
<P>
Jiang indicated that certain complex changes have occurred in
the international arena. "The U.S.-led NATO's bombing against
Yugoslavia and their attack on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade
made people see more clearly the vanity of what they flaunted as
'democracy' and 'human rights'," he stated.
</P>
<P>
"Currently, the bombing against Yugoslavia continues and
civilian casualties have increased in large numbers," he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that the U.S.-led NATO should stop bombing
immediately so as to create the necessary conditions for a
political solution to the Kosovo crisis.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Club Storms to Winning Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, Anhui, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Samsung Fire &AMP; Marine
Insurance club spiked their way to a winning start in the opener
of the first AVC Cup Men's Club Tournament campaign here on
Wednesday by thrashing Paykan club of Iran.
</P>
<P>
The club, with five internationals in the line-up, showed their
advantages in experience and fine balance in both attack and
defence in a 25-20, 17-25, 25-20 thriller which adopted a rally
point scoring system.
</P>
<P>
Samsung showed their teeth from the outset and overcame the
charge of the Iranian team who rebounded to 7-7, 14-14 in the
thick of the first set.
</P>
<P>
The Korean side allowed few chances for Paykan in the second
set and maintained their lead all the way as they impressed the
capacity crowd with their relentless spikes and solid defence.
</P>
<P>
Paykan had to burn their bridge under the best-of-five format
as they stole a temporary lead in the third set but Samsung fought
back with their powerful spikes to pull the game 7-all and
retained their winning momentum before they sealed the match.
</P>
<P>
Paykan head coach Mehranpoor Hossein Ali said at the postmatch
press conference that they were defeated by the jinks on their
meeting against South Korea.
</P>
<P>
"We had lost to the name of the South Korea rather than to
their players," said the coach.
</P>
<P>
But they later corrected themselves saying that their problems
lay with their shortage of international experiences.
</P>
<P>
"We have few international experiences for we have only two
major international matches every year. we play about ten matches
home and abroad in total."
</P>
<P>
Samsung head coach Shin Chi-Yong did not stay long over the
opening success while he put his eyesight on the showdown with
Sichuan Fu Lan of China and NEC Blue Rockets of Japan.
</P>
<P>
"I think we did a better job in the preparation for the opener
than Iran. In this tournament we regarded the Chinese and Japanese
as the main threat."
</P>
<P>
The AVC Cup Men's Club Tournament, which was launched after the
Asian Club Championships had its ten-version spell ended, has
pitched the league champions of the Asian countries including
China, Japan, South Korea, Qatar and Iran.

6. China and Russia express their deep worry at the serious
complication in international situation caused by NATO's
bombardment of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agree that the act is a serious violation of the
U.N. Charter and acknowledged norms of international laws. NATO's
immediate halting of military operations is a necessary condition
to resolve the Kosovo issue by political means.
</P>
<P>
The two sides advocate that the United Nations should play its
due role in tackling the crisis. And any solution should deed the
opinions of Yugoslavia, one of the main parties involved.
</P>
<P>
The move that the chief prosecutor of the criminal tribunal of
the former Yugoslavia signed an indictment of the supreme
political and military leaders of Yugoslavia cannot be considered
an non-political act, which can only further complicate the
negotiation process.
</P>
<P>
Both agreed that continued aggression against Yugoslavia will
further worsen the Balkan situation and have an adverse impact on
the peace and stability in Europe, and even other parts of the
world.
</P>
<P>
The Russian side again condemns NATO's attack on the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade. Russia considers the move a gross
encroachment of Chinese sovereignty and the norms of international
laws. Russia supports China's just and fully grounded stance on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia are willing to continue their efforts in
seeking a political solution to the Kosovo crisis.

BANGKOK, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Snooker Association of Thailand
(SAT) has announced 18 players to carry the Thai flag into
August's SEA Games in Brunei and vowed to produce at least three
gold medals in the 20th regional sport extravaganza, The Nation
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the association also set strict guidelines to keep its
athletes in check by threatening to axe players who violate the
association's rules three times, even if they were gold-medal
prospects.
</P>
<P>
"Players who break the rules for the first time will receive a
warning. If they break the rules a second time, 30 percent of
their allowance will be cut, and if they contravene regulations
again, they will be removed from the team," assistant team manager
Anek Roowatananon said.
</P>
<P>
Former SEA Games champion Choochart Trairattanapradit was named
snooker team's coach, and one-time billiards gold-medallist
Mongkol Kanfaklang was selected as supervisor of the billiards
team.
</P>
<P>
Choochart predicted Thailand should win three of the 10 gold
medals on offer in the Games, including two from snooker and one
from billiards.
</P>
<P>
However, he said it still depends on the performance of
Thailand's arch-rivals Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> Greek Premier Expects War in Yugoslavia to End Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
said Tuesday that the war in Yugoslavia might end soon.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with local television, Simitis said that the
Yugoslav war waged by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
was very likely to end by June 13 when the European Parliament
elections take place, the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA)
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The premier voiced his dissatisfaction with Europe, saying that
Europe could have been the "other pole" of power in the world, but
showed weakness while the U.S. took advantage of the vacuum.
</P>
<P>
During celebrations for NATO's 50th anniversary in Washington
in late April, Simitis revealed, the large majority of
participating leaders rejected the idea by U.S. President Bill
Clinton of a possible change of borders in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the idea was not accepted by NATO, but it was
telling the way of the U.S. regards the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of the Kosovo crisis, Greece, a member of NATO
and the European Union (EU), has insisted that it favors a
peaceful solution to the crisis instead of a NATO military
intervention.
</P>
<P>
Greece also warns that the change of borders in the Balkans can
lead to a widespread war in the region.

<HEADLINE> Iran Welcomes Saudi Remarks on Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi Wednesday termed as "realistic" the latest remarks made
by Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz on relations with
Iran.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said Abdullah's remarks was an indication of the
"positive atmosphere, spirit of realism and transparency
prevailing in the bilateral relations," the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Asharq al-Awsat daily published on
Tuesday, Saudi Prince Abdullah said promotion of the ties between
his country and Iran would benefit the whole region.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi prince also defended Iran's right to boost its
defense.
</P>
<P>
"Iran has every right to develop its defense capabilities for
its security without harming others," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said Iran and Saudi Arabia, as two powerful regional
states, would certainly play important roles in establishing and
strengthening peace and security in the region.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral relations based on the principle of transparency
are expanding, concern about each other has been wiped out and
mutual trust and cooperation are developing, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf Arab states have been wary of Iran's military
development since the 1979 Islamic revolution. But ties between
the two sides have improved since Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami came to power in 1997, particularly following his
ground-breaking visit to Saudi Arabia in May.

Zemin and Russian President Boris Yeltsin in November 1998 in
Moscow greatly promoted the growth of bilateral ties. The views on
the international situation as expounded by the two heads of state

2. The two sides agree that the second informal meeting between

<HEADLINE> Keppel TatLee Bank to Give up 24.9 Pct Equity Stake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Keppel TatLee Bank Limited, one
of the largest banks in Singapore, Wednesday signed an
in-principle agreement with the Allied Irish Banks (AIB) to
relinquish its 24.9 percent equity stake to AIB.
</P>
<P>
A joint press release said this strategic alliance provides for
the two banks to work closely together to significantly enhance
Keppel TatLee Bank's activities in Singapore and the region, and
reposition the bank in the context of the deregulation of the
Singapore Banking Market.
</P>
<P>
It also said AIB will be issued bonds totaling approximately
350 million Singapore dollars (about 203.49 million U.S. dollars)
at one percent coupon rate with 350 million warrants which can be
exercised over a period of three years into 350 million Keppel
TatLee Bank shares at 4.18 Singapore dollars (about 2.43 U.S.
dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
The warrants will bring AIB' total investment to 1.5 billion
Singapore dollars (about 872 million U.S. dollars) and the move
will make shareholders' fund of Keppel TatLee exceeding 5 billion
Singapore dollars (about 2.91 billion U.S. dollars) within three
years.
</P>
<P>
Keppel Corporation Limited, which currently has 36 percent
equity in the Keppel TatLee Bank, will continue to hold about 30
percent interest in the enlarged Keppel TatLee Bank.
</P>
<P>
AIB's acquisition of a quarter of Keppel TatLee Bank's equity
stake came two weeks after the Monetary Authority of Singapore
announced measures to liberalize commercial banking and upgrade
local banks.
</P>
<P>
In the announcement, the Singapore government lifted the 40
percent foreign shareholding limit of local banks.
</P>
<P>
Keppel TatLee, merged by Keppel Bank and TatLee Bank last year,
presently has 59 branches and 110 ATMs in Singapore and three
branches and six representative offices abroad.
</P>
<P>
AIB Group, having a market capitalization of 25 billion
Singapore dollars (about 14.53 billion U.S. dollars) and enjoying
a pre-tax profit of 1.9 billion Singapore dollars (about 1.10
billion U.S. dollars) for 1998, operates principally in Ireland,
Britain, the U.S. and also in Central Europe and Asia. It employs
24,000 people worldwide in more than 900 branches and has 66,000
shareholders.

<HEADLINE> British Foreign Secretary Reiterates Key NATO Objectives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
said Wednesday that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic "must
accept the key NATO objectives of taking Serb forces out of Kosovo
and letting NATO forces in."
</P>
<P>
Cook's comments came as Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari and
Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin prepared for a joint Russian-EU
peace mission to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
"Not because those are our demands but because those are the
minimum conditions for the refugees to return. That's got to be
the key outcome if we're going to secure peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cook said it was unclear whether Milosevic was willing to sign
up to those principles, but if he did there was a good chance of
success for the peace mission.
</P>
<P>
"If he is now willing to accept that, then there is a good
prospect of being able to close a deal," he said.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, an adviser to the Foreign Ministry in
Belgrade, Miraslav Paic, told BBC radio that Yugoslavia was quite
willing to negotiate "but we are not going to accept any kind of
dictate."
</P>
<P>
The makeup of the peacekeeping force should be subject to
discussion between Yugoslav and United Nations authorities, but
Yugoslavia could not accept forces from countries that had been
involved in the Kosovo conflict, he said.
</P>
<P>
As for Yugoslav troop withdrawals, Paic said Yugoslavia had the
right to defend its borders, but "this question can be resolved
and addressed during the negotiations. We are ready to scale down
our presence to peacetime presence."

<HEADLINE> British Part-Time Troops Refuse Balkan Duty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Britain's part-time soldiers are
refusing to volunteer for duty in the Balkans because they say the
government is trying to get their services on the cheap, the Daily
Mail reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper, quoting unidentified officers from the volunteer
Territorial Army, said the soldiers were concerned about
ministers' refusal to guarantee their jobs and pensions while
serving with the regular British army in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
"The resulting lack of volunteers from the Territorial Army
could undermine (Prime Minister) Tony Blair's plans to send a 19,
000 strong force to the war zone in the next few weeks, to be
ready if NATO decides to send in ground troops," the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
Officers said that their infantry units had been called upon to
provide scores of extra men to reinforce regular battalions which
had already been placed on standby for the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
"We have been asked to supply 100 soldiers for the regular
battalion as volunteers," said an officer from one Territorial
Army unit.
</P>
<P>
"At the end of the day, we have families, mortgages and jobs,
and the government won't guarantee them, so we have refused," the
officer was quoted saying.

<HEADLINE> Two Killed Hours Before Polls Open in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A woman in KwaZulu-Natal's
Richmond hot spot and a policeman in Gauteng were shot dead in
separate attacks just hours before polls opened for the country's
national elections Wednesday, South African Press Association
(SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Both attacks occurred around midnight.
</P>
<P>
Four gunmen opened fire on a house in the African National
Congress- dominated Mozambique section of Ndaleni in Richmond
after ordering the occupants to push money underneath the door.
</P>
<P>
The woman, who had responded to their demand, was killed and a
man was wounded.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted Inspector Victor Hunt as saying that the suspects
allegedly fled toward Ezimozomeni -- believed to be the home of
United Democratic Movement supporters.
</P>
<P>
Police are investigating whether the attack was politically or
criminally motivated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Captain Oswald Meyer of the northern KwaZulu-Natal
security operations center said Wednesday morning that the
flash-point areas -- including Nongoma -- had been peaceful
overnight.
</P>
<P>
The Gauteng policeman was ambushed by a group of men as he left
a house near Daveyton.
</P>
<P>
Despite the incidents, the general election is running smoothly
across the country, although the process was slow in some areas.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 police officers and soldiers have been deployed
around the country to ensure a peaceful ballot for the 18,3
million registered voters.
</P>
<P>
The 14,695 voting stations around the country open at 7 a.m.
(0500 GMT).

record-high 4.5 billion U.S. dollar pledge garnered by the
Philippines during the recent Consultative Group Meeting in Tokyo
among foreign-aid donors.
</P>
<P>
It has also committed 500 million Japanese yen (4.17 million
U.S. dollars) for Mindanao's food security program, as well as 1
billion U.S. dollars of the Obuchi fund and about 6 billion U.S.
dollars of the Miyazawa aid initiative to the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
In South Korea, Estrada will convey the Philippines'
appreciation to Seoul for the grant of financial assistance for
the establishment of the Korea-Philippines Friendship Hospital.
</P>
<P>
As Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican said on Tuesday,
Estrada will take the opportunity to project a positive image of
the Philippines by highlighting the strengths of the country's
economy as well as its ability to cope with the regional currency
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The trip will likewise promote stronger cooperation between the
private sectors of the countries involved and pave the way for the
exploration of business possibilities and opportunities, leading
to the forging of business partnerships for mutual benefit.

agreements amounting to 3 billion Japanese yen (25 million U.S.
dollars), which covers food, education and financial area.

<P>
Estrada is likewise expected to extend an invitation to Kim to
attend the ASEAN +3 and ASEAN +1 Summit in Manila this November.
</P>
<P>

Filipinos, the two-nation swing will also enable the Philippine
president to interact with leaders and representatives of Filipino
communities there.

For 1998, the Philippine Embassy in Tokyo reported that there
is a total of 245,518 Filipinos in Japan.

<HEADLINE> Falae Greets President Obasanjo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an advertisement, Falae who lost the February 27
presidential election said, "I wish to congratulate General
Olusegun Obasanjo and Alhaji Abubakar Atiku on the occasion of
their swearing-in and installation as the president and
vice-president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria."
</P>
<P>
Falae's congratulatory message came as a surprise to many
Nigerians as the APP candidate had refused to acknowledge
Obasanjo's victory in the February 27 polls which he stated was
marred by irregularities allegedly perpetrated by Obasanjo's party
of the People's Democratic Party (PDP).
</P>
<P>
Falae, the joint presidential candidate of APP and the Alliance
for Democracy (AD) who polled over 11 million votes compared with
Obasanjo's more than 18 million vowed to challenge Obasanjo's
victory at the election petition tribunals.
</P>
<P>
He rejected appeals from some quarters of the country that he
should not file a petition against Obsanjo's victory to avoid a
situation where some adventurous military officers would utilize
the opportunity to derail the transition program, and filed a
petition at the Federal Court of Appeal against Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
The Court of Appeal, however, dismissed all the charges raised
by Falae and declared Obasanjo validly elected as the president of
the Fourth Republic of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Following the court dismissal, Falae refused to explore the
last legal option of filing an appeal at the Supreme Court, saying
that "while there is great public sympathy and support for our
cause, there is widespread concern that a protracted legal battle
may be used as an excuse by ambitious military elements to prolong
military rule in the country."

<HEADLINE> Interview: CDMA Forerunners Eye Asia Market (1) By Lu Jin and Tao Wenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 2 (Xinhua) -- In the eyes of some
telecommunication giants, their new darling technology CDMA (code-
division multiple-access) is on its way to a boom in the Asia
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Executives of some of the world's leading providers of
telecommunications service and products have expressed their
optimism and confidence in the prospects about CDMA market in
China and the rest of the Asia Pacific Region.
</P>
<P>
The development of CDMA, a continuous digital transmission
technology, in the Asia Pacific region is dramatic, said Terry Yen,
a member of the CDMA Development Group (CDG), which is to convene
its fourth annual World Congress in Hong Kong in mid-June.
</P>
<P>
CDMA is a traditionally U.S.-based technology, but a lot of the
first-class world technologies have been put into use in Asia, Yen
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the CDG, the worldwide subscribers of its flagship
technology, cdmaOne, totaled 29 million at the end of March this
year, a one-year increase of over 300 percent.
</P>
<P>
The rapid growth of the technology is occurring in every
region in the world with the Asia Pacific leading the way with a
one-year net increase of 10.9 million. Worldwide, operators have
added more than 19 million subscribers since March of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Yen said that the annual CDMA World Congress to be held in Hong
Kong between June 14 and 18 will be the "most important event for
the CDMA industry."
</P>
<P>
Companies of the industry want to use this opportunity to
exchange information and experience among the CDMA community, Yen
said.
</P>
<P>
"In many ways Asia is our home with the first CDMA network
being launched here by (local telecom company) Hutchison in Hong
Kong and it's natural for us to focus on Hong Kong for this
congress," he added.
</P>
<P>
Company executives believed that the opening of the Chinese
market is very attractive and many companies want to use Hong Kong
as a hub for a lot of high technologies to enter the China market.
</P>
<P>
The CDMA technology is, for this region, a fast growing
technology year on year, said Thomas Hinton, vice president and
general manager of greater China Network Solutions Division of
Motorola.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide CDMA launch in Japan is "astonishing" with
networks having been set up recently, he said. Their No. 1 selling
phones produced by Hitachi are sold out months in advance.
</P>
<P>
The CDG said Tuesday that cdmaOne technology has gained
significant momentum in Japan as a result of the recent cdmaOne
nationwide service launch.
</P>
<P>
The Republic of Korea has the largest population of CDMA users
in the world in contrast to its geographically small size.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the entire region will benefit from the recent
third generation (3G) harmonization efforts as cdmaOne is the only
technology offering a seamless evolution path with the ability to
deploy 3G services in existing spectrum bands.

<HEADLINE> hke060237-Vietnamese Businesses Urged to Be Ready for Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese businesses have not paid
sufficient attention to the country's process of integrating into
the regional and world economy, Vietnam's Deputy Minister of Trade
Tran Duc Minh said.
</P>
<P>
Minh said at a seminar Tuesday on regional and global
integration  that "Vietnamese firms have not actually outlined
business plans to help them survive the harsh competition when
Vietnam phases out its non-tariff barriers with regional
countries."
</P>
<P>
The seminar was attended by executives of foreign-invested
companies in Ho Chi Minh City.
</P>
<P>
A majority of enterprises, Minh said, were still holding the
false idea that they could rely on the government protectionist
measures.
</P>
<P>
Certain sensitive items like steel, vehicles, sugar, seafood,
rice and coffee are now still protected by the Vietnamese
government.
</P>
<P>
However, Minh warned that the current protectionism could not
last long. Therefore, he said, Vietnamese enterprises have to
restructure their production and enhance management.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is trying to gradually integrate with the regional and
world economy and became a member of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations in July 1995 and a member of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation in November 1998.

BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The number of mobile phone users in
China has been on a constant rise in recent years and now exceeds
30 million, ranking third in the world after the United States and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Since mobile telecommunications were introduced to China in
1987, business has grown 100 percent on an annual basis, according
to Feng Yu, an official in the Ministry of Information Industry.
</P>

Even greater potential is yet to be tapped as the popularity
rate of mobile phones in China remains below 3 percent in terms of

<HEADLINE> Interview: CDMA Forerunners Eye Asia Market (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hinton said that China is the world's largest potential market
for whatever technologies which are new, whether it is of
refrigerators, computers or wireless devices. And China is leading
the CDMA industry as represented by the trial of new networks in
several big cities.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is actually the birth place of CDMA in Asia and the
success of Hutchison's CDMA network in Hong Kong is well known,
Hinton said.
</P>
<P>
According to Hinton, Motorola, providing CDMA systems in eight
countries and areas in Asia, is also a supplier of one of the
initial CDMA networks in China. Motorola provides networks in
Beijing and the number of subscribers based there is now
approaching 14,000 on that very small system.
</P>
<P>
Motorola has established the first CDMA manufacturing joint
venture in East China's Hangzhou in 1996 and this joint venture
provides a big portion of Beijing operational networks.
</P>
<P>
David Ho, senior vice president of wireless networks for
Greater China of Nortel Networks, said that every CDMA supplier is
interested in China, "the biggest untapped market."
</P>
<P>
Nortel has a CDMA system in Northwest China's Xi'an and has
recently established a joint venture in China.
</P>
<P>
Paul Calcott, marketing and strategy director of Asia Pacific
Wireless Networks of Lucent Technologies, said the Asia pacific is
"quite unique" in a lot of ways because Asian countries do not
develop at the same rate.
</P>
<P>
"A change we have seen in the industry is that the products in
the communications mechanism is much more lifestyle driven rather
than technology driven," said Calcott.
</P>
<P>
"One of the objectives for us in the industry should be that
wireless and CDMA technology become the preferred access for
consumers," Calcott said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he added, "what we are hoping to come out of the (
CDMA) world congress is certainly some real driving points that
take us to the next step we need to take," particularly for a
region like the Asia Pacific where the CDMA industry grows at a "
phenomenal rate," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lucent Technologies, in the forefront of implementing wireless
systems worldwide, now has CDMA networks in five countries.
</P>
<P>
The deployment of CDMA in China represents nothing more than
the introduction of extension of competition, Hinton said.
</P>
<P>
"I really believe this is much more positive for the overall
market than the negative," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ho said that he believes the deployment of CDMA in China will
just "make the pie bigger, but not smaller," adding that China
Telecom will continue to grow GSM, PCS200 and it will continue to
be a market leader as far as the subscribers are concerned.
</P>
<P>
All these executives have expressed their support to Hong
Kong's ambitious plan to develop into a information technology hub
in the region, in particular, the multi-billion-dollar Cyberport
project.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- China has boosted it efforts to
standardize and control the activities of private businesses,
which have been given more development room than years ago, in a
bid to keep the market in good order.
</P>
<P>
All levels of administrations for industry and commerce in
China handled 137,700 cases of irregular activities involving
private firms in the first quarter of this year involving fines
totaling 37.51 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, more than 4,000 private firms were
ordered to suspend business for regulation violations and another
6,600 illegally established firms had their business licenses
revoked.
</P>
<P>
The cases fell into six categories: a total of 85,700 cases
violated registration regulations; more than 15,000 cases involved
infringements of consumer rights; 1,100 cases violated the Unfair
Competition Law; the other three categories involved scalping
prohibited goods, selling fake or shoddy products, and producing
illegal publications.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration for Industry and Commerce is urging
relevant departments to enhance market supervision by combating
forgery of brandname products, closing down illegally set up firms
and other monitoring efforts.

<P>
CANBERRA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
marginally lower Wednesday, with the market brushing aside robust
growth figures in favor of a poor commodity prices outlook.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended in Sydney at 64.48 U.S. cents, from
64.60 U.S. cents Tuesday, having traded between 64.20 and 64.60
U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Australia's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 1.1 percent,
seasonally adjusted, in the quarter ending in March for an annual
growth of 4.8 percent, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Despite being slightly above expectations, the data was
overshadowed by pessimism over longer term factors such as the
continuing poor outlook on commodity prices, a new 20-year low in
the price of gold, and the impact of a rate hike in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar also closed locally at 0.6167 euro from

<HEADLINE> New Traditional Chinese Medicine Guide to Be Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- An up-to-date guide to the use of
traditional Chinese medicine is to be published later this year
which experts believe will become the definitive work on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
The 30-volume "Materia Medica of China" will contain
information on nearly 9,000 kinds of herbal medicines and drugs
made from animal materials or minerals, according to the State
Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, which initiated
the work in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Each entry will have a description of its outward appearance,
chemical composition and functions, the planting and processing
methods, as well as clinical research results.
</P>
<P>
The books will also include details of some 1,500 kinds of
medicines that are used by some of China's ethnic groups, such as
the Tibetan, Mongolian, Uygur and Dai peoples.
</P>
<P>
"These books are important traditional Chinese medicine
reference materials and incorporate the results of centuries of
experience in the field as well as the results of modern research,
" said Li Zhenji, deputy director of the Administration.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the "Compendium of Materia Medica", which was
compiled by Li Shizhen, a noted traditional Chinese medicine
master of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), is still regarded as the
leading guide to the use of traditional Chinese medicines. However,
it only contains information on 1,892 kinds of medicines.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 experts from some 60 domestic academies and
research institutes were involved in compiling the information
over the ten-year period, using over 10,000 kinds of ancient and
modern publications as references, according to the Shanghai
Science and Technology Publishing House, the publisher of the
pharmacopoeia which will hit the bookstores in September.

<HEADLINE> China Keen to Work with Russia for Multi-Polar World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan said here today that China is keen to promote consultation
with Russia to establish a just and reasonable new international
order and a multi-polar world.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks during talks with his Russian counterpart
Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that China and Russia share wide-ranging consensus on
the Kosovo issue, and have reached mutual understanding on related
issues. "China appreciates Russia's efforts to seek a political
solution of the Kosovo crisis," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov briefed Tang on Russia's view on the current
international situation, especially the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S.-led NATO should immediately stop bombing
to create conditions for restoring stability in Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that bilateral relations have maintained their good
development trend, especially after President Jiang Zemin visited
Russia last November, during which the two countries' heads of
state held their first unofficial meeting. And Premier Zhu Rongji
visited Russia last February, during which the two sides reached
consensus on expanding cooperation in all areas.
</P>
<P>
"Experience shows that establishing Sino-Russian strategic and
cooperative partnership is in the fundamental interests of the two
peoples," he said. He added that the two countries should make
full preparations for the second unofficial meeting between the
two heads of state to be held this fall, and take further measures
to implement all agreements signed in the fourth regular meeting
between the prime ministers of the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Australian Economy Surges 4.8 Percent in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Australia's economic growth surged
beyond expectations in the first quarter of 1999 to 4.8 percent,
driven by booming consumer spending and a rebound in business
spending in preparation for computer year 2000 (Y2K) problems.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said Wednesday the
country's gross domestic product (GDP) grew 1.1 percent in the
March quarter, seasonally adjusted, bringing the annual growth to
4.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The result was driven by booming household spending and boosted
business investment, with the main drags on growth being
languishing exports and a fall in government consumption, the ABS
said.
</P>
<P>
Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said the Australian economy
had put in a first-class performance of strong growth and low
inflation.
</P>
<P>
But the treasurer warned that while GDP growth may exceed the
government's forecast of 4.25 percent for the fiscal year of
1998-1999 ending on June 30, 1999, it may have peaked.
</P>
<P>
"Will the Australian economy keep up the clip of 4.8 percent in
(the fiscal year of) 1999/2000?" he asked. "We don't think so."
</P>
<P>
According to an ABS survey, a 21.6-percent rise in spending on
new machinery and equipment by the private sector - in preparation
for the Y2K computer bug - buoyed the growth.
</P>
<P>
Household final consumption expenditure rose by 1.7 percent,
while imports of goods and services increased by 3.9 percent as
exports fell slightly.
</P>
<P>
General government spending was down 3.2 percent but business
investment rebounded by 9.6 percent - even though it remained 7
percent lower than a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Strong growth in most retail sectors was offset by falls in
motor vehicle purchases and spending on cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
The Australian economy, the 14th largest in the world, grew by
4.7 percent in 1998.

BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
said here today that Japan should stick to the road of peace and
development by using history as mirror and overcoming interference.
</P>
<P>
He told a delegation from Japan's Association of Governors
headed by its President Tsuchiya Yoshihiko that China and Japan

</P>

"Increasing ties between China and Japan would benefit peace

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The organisers of the 2000 Sydney
Olympic Games announced on Wednesday that they were reinstating
the cycling road race course.
</P>
<P>
The organising committee SOCOG said last month that it was
moving the race to another course west of Sydney to save money,
also to avoid a possible compensation claim from Rupert Murdoch's
Fox studios.
</P>
<P>
But the SOCOG was forced to change its mind under the pressure
of the International Cycling Union (UCI). The UCI complained that
the new course would not be testing enough for a top race and
Olympic road planners said it would disrupt traffic.
</P>
<P>
SOCOG vice-president John Coates said on Wednesday that SOCOG
had proposed reinstating most of the original course, including a
steep climb up from the Pacific ocean.
</P>
<P>
But the road races would now start and finish at the Sydney
Cricket Ground instead of the Sydney Football Stadium.

<HEADLINE> China Strengthens External Audit of Foreign Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China (PBOC),
the country's central bank, today issued guidelines for the
external auditing of overseas-funded banks, which is a necessary
part of the supervision of China's banking sector.
</P>
<P>
They set out the rules for overseas banks using registered
accountants as well as the required qualifications for accountancy
firms involved in external auditing for overseas banks.
</P>
<P>
Essentially the guidelines stipulate that overseas banks should
engage only one accountancy firm to audit all their activities in
China, and that those firms should have no fewer than 20
registered accountants with some obviously familiar with
international banking business.
</P>
<P>
Registered accountants are required, in line with the
guidelines, to audit the closing fiscal year accounts of overseas
banks, as well as assessing their assets, liabilities, profits and
losses, asset quality, financial reports filed to the PBOC,
internal control systems, computer systems and information
management systems.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines also explain the procedures for the appointment
of registered accountants by overseas banks, the auditing methods,
the training of registered accountants, auditing reports and other
aspects of the work.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Former President Files Suit Against Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian former president
Soeharto Wednesday filed a defamation suit against the U.S. news
magazine Time for a report alleging that he and his family have
amassed a 15 billion U.S. dollar fortune.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto went to the national police headquarters, accompanied
by his eldest daughter Siti Hardiyanti "Tutut" Rukmana, and six of
his eight lawyers, to file the suit.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, who will be 78 next Tuesday, reiterated that the
leading American magazine's report on his wealth is a lie and
constitutes defamation.
</P>
<P>
Time reported that the Soehartos' fortune includes 9 billion
U.S. dollars in cash that was transferred from a bank in
Switzerland to another bank in Austria shortly after the former
ruler was forced from office in May last year.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto asserted in a recent private television interview that
he did not own a single cent in foreign banks and he challenged
the government and the general public to trade whatever wealth he
possesses overseas.
</P>
<P>
As Soeharto filed a defamation suit against Time at police
headquarters, his youngest son Hutomo Mandala Putra, alias Tommy,
was summoned by the Attorney General here Wednesday in connection
with the magazine's report.
</P>
<P>
According to the Attorney General Office's spokesman
Soehandoyo, the prosecution team members raised eight questions
with Tommy in connection with his wealth, as reported in the
magazine's May 24 edition.
</P>
<P>
He said Tommy answered most of the questions in a hand-written
format.
</P>
<P>
Besides Tommy, his brothers Sigit Harjojudanto (Soeharto's
eldest son) and Bambang Trihatmodjo (Soeharto's second son), and
his sister Tutut had previously been summoned in connection with
the same case.
</P>
<P>
According to a tentative schedule, Soeharto's daughters Siti
Hediyati "Titiek" Harjadi and Siti Hutami "Mamiek" Endang
Adiningsih will be questioned on Thursday and Friday respectively.

<HEADLINE> Kabila's Minister Appeals to Museveni on Son </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Congolese (K) Minister of Industry
and Economy Bemba Saolona, father of one of rebel leaders fighting
to oust President Laurent Kabila, appealed to Ugandan President
Yoweri Museveni Tuesday to convince his son to abandon rebellion.
</P>
<P>
The minister, one of the six members of the visiting delegation
from Kinshasa, made known his appeal at a press conference, the
New Vision paper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said his son, leader of the Congolese Liberation Army (MLC)
fighting in the northern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC), was trained by Ugandans as a soldier.
</P>
<P>
The minister, a millionaire in the mineral-rich country, was
jailed for some days by Kabila on suspicion of dealing with rebels
who control nearly half of Africa's third largest country. He was
released and made minister in March at the height of an offensive
by MLC in northwestern Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
The junior Bemba, however, said he was fighting to stop the
injustice in the country, adding that his father's political line
does not in the least affect his cause.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Dollar Plunges Steeply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand dollar has kept
sliding in its value and is now down more than 6 percent compared
with levels less than a month ago.
</P>
<P>
The NZ dollar was down more than half a cent of the U.S. dollar
 Wednesday to less than 53 cents of the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
It has also weakened against the Australian currency from 84.5
cents of an Australian dollar at the start of May to 81.6 cents
Wednesday, the lowest rate since 1994.
</P>
<P>
A fortnight ago, Governor Don Brash of the Reserve Bank (New
Zealand's central bank) warned local financial markets that he was
 puzzled by the rising value of the New Zealand dollar. The
currency had risen on the expectation of stronger commodity
prices around the world, improved world economic growth and a
greater demand for the New Zealand currency to buy shares in
Contact Energy which the New Zealand government sold recently.
</P>
<P>
Local economists hold that the New Zealand dollar tends to move
in tandem with the Australian currency as both are linked to the
state of international commodity prices. They said the rapidly
falling New Zealand dollar helps the exports of the country.
</P>
<P>
Economists with the Bank of New Zealand have been encouraged to
lift the bank's forecast for New Zealand economic growth this year

<HEADLINE> Petrol Prices in New Zealand Keep Falling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The household petrol price index
 in New Zealand fell for the fifth consecutive quarter, down 2.2
percent between the fourth quarter of last year and the first
quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
In a media release, the Statistics New Zealand said Wednesday
that the commercial price indexes for bulk petrol and diesel also
fell, down 0.8 and 0.7 percent respectively in the first quarter
this year.
</P>
<P>
Household consumers are paying 10.8 percent less for petrol
than they did in the fourth quarter of 1998, it said, adding the
main reasons for this appeared to be increased competition between
petrol retailers and low world oil prices.
</P>
<P>
According to the release, electricity generation in the first
quarter was 1.6 percent lower than in the previous quarter. Hydro
generation decreased 12.8 percent due to South Island lakes
receiving their lowest inflows in more than 65 years. Thermal
generation increased by 31.2 percent to compensate for the
reduction in hydro electricity generation.
</P>
<P>
Gas production for the first quarter was 3.9 percent higher
than a year earlier. Increased gas use in the power generation and
methanol sectors are possible explanations for this rise, the
Statistics New Zealand said.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand's Building Consents on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The total value of consents for
buildings issued in April by the concerned department of the New
Zealand government was 514.3 million New Zealand dollars (282
million U.S. dollars), one of the highest totals in the last 18
months, the Statistics New Zealand said in a media release
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Residential buildings had a big influence on the total, with
their total value reaching 349.3 million NZ dollars (192 million
U.S. dollars). A total of 2,253 consents worth 286.6 million NZ
dollars (157 million U.S. dollars) were issued for new dwellings
in April, the second highest monthly total since September 1997
and a 32 percent increase over the same month of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The rise was attributed to increased confidence in the economy
and low interest rates. It was the eighth consecutive month of
strong growth for the building of new dwellings, the Statistics
New Zealand said.
</P>
<P>
Non-residential buildings' value increased for the first time
since December 1997 to 165.1 million NZ dollars (90 million U.S.
dollars). The Statistics New Zealand cautioned that it was too
early to say if this marked a turning point.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Seeks to Dispel Fears in Jezzine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's leading anti-Israeli
guerrilla group Hezbollah has renewed its assurances to Jezzine
residents in south Lebanon that it cared about their safety and
would not harm them after the pro-Israeli militia's departure.
</P>
<P>
"This is obvious from the sacrifices the resistance has made
throughout the years to liberate the area," Hezbollah's
secretary-general Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah told a delegation from
Jezzine Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Monday night, the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA) began
retreating from Jezzine, a Christian town it has held for 14
years, just north of the Israeli-occupied border zone in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The SLA decided to leave the area in the face of mounting
casualties from frequent roadside bombings launched by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah has been leading a war of attrition to oust Israeli
forces and the SLA out of Lebanon in 1985 when Israel set up a
self-declared security zone in the south of the country allegedly
to shield its northern area from attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The SLA's pullback has fueled fears among residents in Jezzine
that Hezbollah would enter the area and seek to revenge on
suspected collaborators with Israel or SLA.
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah dismissed as "exaggerated" fears of Jezzine residents
that the town would be left in a dangerous security vacuum until
the deployment of Lebanese army.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that his fighters will not enter Jezzine and harass
its inhabitants and will not use it as a base for attacks against
Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
But, he stressed that those collaborators should be handed
over to the Lebanese judiciary.
</P>
<P>
The 2,500-strong SLA, established in 1985, have been trained
and financed by Israel to help it patrol the occupied zone. Its
members are considered in Lebanon as traitors and its commander
Antoine Lahd has been sentenced to death in absentia by a Beirut
military court.
</P>
<P>
It is not immediately clear whether the Lebanese army would
take over Jezzine after the SLA withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government has been reluctant to commit regular
troops to Jezzine lest it be interpreted as providing security
guarantees to Israel.
</P>
<P>
But Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss has assured local
residents in the town that the government would take full
responsibility for the security of the 5,000 population.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- An official with the World Health
Organization (WHO) has urged African countries to improve their
capacity for collection, processing and dissemination of health
information.
</P>
<P>
The WHO country representative Edward Maganu said here Tuesday
while officially opening a four-day training course on the African
Index Medicus (AIM) that more often than not, African countries
depended on foreign data bases to have access to health
information, even on what is generated in their own land, Zambian
newspaper, the Post, reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"More of these data bases are expensive and do not carry a
comprehensive record of information generated in Africa," Maganu
said.
</P>
<P>
He commended University of Zambia for organizing the training
workshop whose aim was to improve Zambia's capacity for
collection, processing and dissemination of information.
</P>
<P>
Maganu assured Zambia of the world organization's continued
support through the provision of technical assistance to the AIM
project.
</P>
<P>
Lupambo Munkonge, dean of School of Medicine at the University
of Zambia, said poor communication among the participating
countries in AIM was affecting the indexing of African
publications on major international data bases.
</P>
<P>
"We in Zambia, through this training, try to overcome this
hurdle and take a lead in facilitating access to health
information so that we can share with other participating
countries," Munkonge said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislature to Evaluate Forest Law Enforcement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The National People's Congress (NPC)
, China's legislature, today exhibited its discontent with slow
growth of the country's forest coverage over the past two decades
in spite of increased funding and announced it will evaluate
implementation of the Forest Law.
</P>
<P>
"Afforestation efforts have been offset by massive illegal
logging and pilfering by both individuals and local state-owned
enterprises," said Buhe, vice chairman of the NPC Standing
Committee who will head fact-finding tours.
</P>
<P>
The current ratio of the nation's forest coverage is only 1.2
percent higher than in 1980, and currently stands at 13.92 percent,
or half the worldwide level.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the government has constantly augmented
allocations for planting and protecting trees, with last year's
inputs of 4.62 billion yuan representing a four-fold rise on 1997,
according to reports issued by the Finance Ministry and the State
Planning and Development Commission.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government plans to allocate an additional 2.8
billion yuan this year to protect virgin forest in 12 provinces,
including Sichuan and Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration of Forestry points out that
destruction has accompanied the period of construction extending
over several years. The fact that many state-owned timber
enterprises controlled by local governments have ignored logging
quotas has greatly aggravated the situation already plagued by
theft and excessive logging on the part of individuals.
</P>
<P>
An additional 2.57 million hectares of forest land have been
illegally occupied for farm land or other uses since 1994,
according to the administration.
</P>
<P>
Experts note that related deforestation has further aggravated
damage created by natural disaster such as last year's record
summer flooding along the Yangtze River and in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
NPC fact-finding tours, which are scheduled to begin this month,
will mainly focus on the upper reaches of rivers in Heilongjiang
and Sichuan provinces and the Inner Mongolia and Guangxi Zhuang
autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
Buhe instructs members of fact-finding missions to focus on
the responsibility local governments bear for enforcing the Forest
Law promulgated in 1985 and revised last year. The Forest Law was
designed as an effective tool to help attain the national goal of
increasing the forest coverage rate by 3.5 percent within 10 years.

NAIROBI, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has asked the country's Chief Justice Zacchaeus Chesoni to set up
special courts to prosecute corruption cases.

The president made the remarks Tuesday when he addressed the
nation in an off- the-cuff speech at Uhuru (freedom) Park in
Nairobi during the 36th Madaraka (internal self rule)
celebration, the East African Standard reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The special courts would be made up of a bench of judges, he
said, adding that many corruption cases were pending in the
courts, hence the need for the special courts to speed up the
hearing of those cases.
</P>
<P>
Moi decried the rampant corruption in the country, especially
in the civil service, saying the public sector was running down
the government's efforts at developing the nation.
</P>
<P>
He warned corrupt government employees that their time to face
the music had come and assured Kenyans that the Kenya
Anti-Corruption Authority will investigate and bring to justice
all corrupt individuals.
</P>
<P>
"Corruption must be eliminated if this country is to move into
the future with confidence and prosperity for all Kenyans," Moi
observed.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that civil servants were expected to maintain
integrity and high professional ethics in their work as
development projects implementers.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- China is accelerating the
development of energy resources in a bid to basically meet the
demand for energy in the coming century and guarantee sustainable
economic development.
</P>
<P>
An official in charge of energy development in the State
Development Planning Commission said China will pay equal
attention to developing energy resources and saving energy in the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
He noted that energy development in the next century will be
based on coal production and focused on power generation, and the
development of petroleum, natural gas, nuclear power, as well as
other new and renewable energy resources will be accelerated.
</P>
<P>
The official also noted that China will launch a series of
strategic drives in the next century. One of the drives, the coal
sector will be shifted westwards and great efforts will be made to
develop the Shenfu and Dongsheng coalfields and ease bottlenecks
in coal transportation.
</P>
<P>
In the power sector, China will accelerate construction of
hydroelectric power stations along major rivers and coal firing
power plants near coal mines.
</P>
<P>
The petroleum industry will prioritize oil and gas exploitation
in western China and in offshore areas.
</P>
<P>
In early next century, China's major coal bases will be in
Shanxi, Shaanxi, Heilongjiang and Guizhou provinces and western
Inner Mongolia, its major water-power producers will be on the
upper reaches of the Yellow River and the middle and lower reaches
of the Yangtze River, and its major oil supplier will be in Daqing
in the northeast and Shengli in the north.

Mass communication, information technology and
telecommunications operations would benefit from greater
managerial participation by local organizations and relevant
sectors, the release said.

The plan targets radio and television broadcasting, computer
networks and media consumers, as well as the process to monitor
them.
</P>
<P>
At least 50 percent of radio and television programs are to be
reserved for education, culture, national security and the public
interest.

U.S. dollars) for second offenders. As a result companies have
been finding it cheaper to pay the fines than to dispose of their
waste at designated places.
</P>
<P>
A number of companies in Harare, including some reputable
firms, were early this year convicted of dumping toxic waste at
undesignated places.
</P>
<P>
The proposed new fines and jail terms will also be applicable
to any person who obstructs or hinders an inspector searching
premises for hazardous substances, tampers with any samples or
articles taken or makes false statements in connection with any
toxic wastes.
</P>
<P>
The Bill provides for sustainable management of the environment
and natural resources for public benefit and to consolidate laws
relating to the environment, which were previously administered
under different ministries.
</P>
<P>
The Bill is being discussed at the on-going national
environment conference in Harare, the capital.
</P>
<P>
Addressing delegates, Ministers of Mines, Environment and
Tourism Simon Moyo said Zimbabwe had experienced increasing
environmental problems in the last six years.

<HEADLINE> South China Sea Fishing Ban Proceeds Smoothly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The first fishing ban in South
China Sea commenced on Tuesday and is proceeding smoothly,
according to the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's fisheries department reports that a joint check
found only one boat illegally operating in the banned area.
</P>
<P>
The use of trawl nets is banned in an area north of 12 degrees
latitude, including the Beibu Gulf, between June 1 to July 31.
</P>
<P>
Yang Jian, director of the fisheries department, said the
purpose of the ban is to reduce excessive fishing and protect
marine resources. He noted that excessive fishing in recent years
has significantly depleted marine resources and caused a decline
in the output of aquatic products.
</P>
<P>
This year's moratorium idles 15,216 fishing vessels from
Guangdong and Hainan provinces, and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region. Some 15,202 vessels have been berthed and the fisheries
management departments is investigating to determine if the
remaining 14 vessels are berthed in other provinces.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some 1,879 vessels from Hong Kong and Macao have
also been berthed.
</P>
<P>
China's fishing ban in the East and Yellow seas since 1995 has
helped increase the annual output of aquatic products.

<HEADLINE> Merrill Lynch Launches Internet Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., the largest U.
S. stock brokerage, announced here Tuesday that it will allow
customers to trade stocks over the Internet for 29.95 U.S. dollars
per transaction.
</P>
<P>
"Whether clients want advice and guidance from a skilled
financial consultant, convenient, self-directed Internet investing,
or some combination, they'll get it at Merrill Lynch," David
Komansky, chairman and chief executive officer of the company,
said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The company made the decision in face of challenge for its
business from on-line traders such as Charles Schwab Corp. The
Internet now accounts for 30 percent to 35 percent of all stock
trades by individuals.
</P>
<P>
The company will also permit investors to do unlimited free
trading in return for an annual account fee equaling about 0.2
percent of the account's asset. Its minimum fee will be 1,500
dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
The decision marks a dramatic change for Merrill Lynch after
spending decades to forge a nationwide network of 14,800 brokers,
who provide customers with investment advices and earn commissions
for placing stock trades. Analysts estimate that about two billion
dollars of Merrill's 1998 revenue of 17.5 billion dollars came
from commissions paid by individual investors for stock and bond
trades.
</P>
<P>
The Merrill's Internet service will be available starting
December this year. Clients who want to continue to deal with
Merrill as before -- advised by a broker and paying full
commissions, will still be able to do so.

<HEADLINE> Buying Power of Vietnam's Rural Residents Declining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The buying power of Vietnam's rural
residents is continuing to decline, Vietnam's English daily
Vietnam News reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey by the Ministry of Planning and Investment
(MPI) showed that Vietnam's rural residents now buy only 29
percent of consumer goods in the country annually, despite
accounting for about 80 percent of the total population.
</P>
<P>
The consumption ratio of rural residents has fallen
year-by-year, from 37.7 percent in 1996 to 30.66 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The MPI attributed the main reason for the decline to the low
average income of rural residents, which is 2 million Vietnamese
dong (VND) (145 U.S. dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
The figure falls further to below 1 million VND (72 U.S.
dollars) for residents in Vietnam's remote, mountainous and
natural calamity-prone areas.
</P>
<P>
Currently about 14 million people are classified as poor
throughout Vietnam and 90 percent of them are rural residents.
</P>
<P>
According to the standard set by Vietnam's Ministry of Labor,
War Invalids and Social Affairs, families which earn less than per
capita monthly income of 25 kilograms of rice or 90,000 VND (6.47
U.S. dollars) in urban areas, 20 kg of rice or 70,000 VND (5.03
U.S. dollars) in lowland rural areas, and 15 kg of rice equal to
55,000 VND (3.95 U.S. dollars) in the mountainous rural areas are
defined as poor.

<HEADLINE> Thai Govt Bonds Warmly Received In First Issue Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Thai investors Tuesday
flooded the Bank of Thailand's headquarters, its nationwide
offices and other agents, taking up to seven billion baht (191.8
million U.S. dollars) of the government bonds on the first
marketing day, The Nation reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The central bank and its branches sold 1.03 billion baht (28.2
million dollars) of the 25 billion baht (684.9 million dollar)
bonds.
</P>
<P>
Most buyers were civil servants and retired officials who were
attracted by the after-tax return of 5.7375 percent of the
government bonds which are much higher than the deposit rates at
commercial banks which are between 4.0-4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Many of the investors said they wanted to spend part of their
entire savings on these bonds for the return, which is payable
semi-annually.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the central bank, other selling agents of the bonds
include the Government Savings Bank which successfully sold 2.06
billion baht (56.4 million dollar) bonds in the first day.
</P>
<P>
The overwhelming response from the public was beyond the
central banks' expectation.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand has been convinced that the
25-billion-baht bonds would be sold out before September, the end
of the 1998-99 fiscal year.

<P>
BANGKOK, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Inflation is running at
its lowest monthly level for 15 years and Last month's inflation
rate stood at minus 0.5 percent compared a year earlier, according
to figures released by the Thai Commerce Ministry.

For the first five months, inflation was running at 1.5 percent
year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
The May figure was the lowest since minus 1.6 percent was

</P>
<P>
Inflation was likely to decline further because of the
government's attempts to reduce or hold production costs including
electricity and cooking gas prices, as well as the cut in
value-added tax to 7 percent from 10 percent, Suchai Jaovisidha,
the internal trade department chief, was quoted Wednesday by the

PHNOM PENH, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Tourist arrivals in the first
quarter of this year in Cambodia recorded a 19 percent increase
over the same period of last year, according to the Ministry of
Tourism's recent statistics.
</P>
<P>
The number of tourist arrivals in the first quarter reached
62,209, raising optimism about the outlook for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
Tourism officials attributed the rise to stability in Cambodia,
which is luring more tourists here. In addition, visitors are
beginning to stay longer in Cambodia than before because more
destinations in the country are accessible.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the visitors were from Asia. The United
States was the country which sent the most visitors to Cambodia
with about 11.5 percent of all visitors during the first three
months of the year, followed by France, China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Tourism expects Cambodia to be one of the
region's fastest-growing destination now that the country is a
full member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
The ministry has predicted a 25 percent annual growth in
tourism for the next 10 years.

<HEADLINE> Good Harvest of Vietnam's Winter-Spring Crop in Sight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's winter-spring rice crop of
this year is expected to reach a record 13.9 million tons, 300,000
tons more than the previous one, Vietnam News said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the anticipated high output is that rice
fields have been expanded by 2,886 hectares, a 3.7 percent
increase.
</P>
<P>
The provinces in Cuu Long (Mekong) Delta, Vietnam's biggest
granary, have already reaped their harvests, with an average
output of five tons per hectare, a slight drop of about 0.3 tons.
However, the total rice output in the southern delta is estimated
at 7.3 million tons, an increase of 123,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Song Hong (Red River) Delta provinces look set to produce more
rice than the previous crop as the area has a good irrigation
system. It is estimated that the northern delta will register a
per-hectare increase of 0.09 tons against the previous crop, with
a total output of 2.9 million tons, an increase of 43,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
However, provinces in the mid-land and mountainous areas of the
north of Vietnam have faced a prolonged drought, forcing the
conversion of 23,000 hectares to alternative crops.

<HEADLINE> UN Should Play Due Role in Kosovo Issue: Foreign Ministers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The UN Security Council should play
its due role in resolving the Kosovo issue, Chinese Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan said here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Tang made the remark at a meeting with the press shortly after
the talks between Tang and his Russian counterpart Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
Both sides believe that the opinions of the Yugoslav Federation
should be fully heard in any plans to settle the issue, Tang added.
</P>
<P>
He said that both China and Russia had agreed to further
consultations and coordination on the international issues,
including the Kosovo crisis, and to work together to safeguard
world peace and oppose power politics in the future.
</P>
<P>
Sharing Tang's view, Ivanov said Russia and China agreed to
help strengthen the role of the UN in international affairs. The
two countries felt uneasy about the trend pursuing power politics
and mono-polar world, Ivanov added, noting that Russia and China,
both as permanent members of the UN Security Council, would
enhance cooperation to resist such dangerous trend.

<HEADLINE> Two Belgian Ministers Resign Over Chicken Contamination Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Belgian Health Minister Marcel
Colla and Farm Minister Karel Pinxten resigned Tuesday amid a
scandal over contaminated chicken meat and eggs in the country as
the government announced a national ban on selling poultry
products.
</P>
<P>
The ministers handed in their resignations to King Albert II
after long discussions with Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the Health Ministry ordered wholesalers to stop
selling chicken meat and eggs until they were proved free from the
cancer-causing chemical dioxin found in some chicken feed in
several farms.
</P>
<P>
High levels of the carcinogen was detected in late April in
chicken feed produced by nine Belgian companies, which were found
to have fortified the feed with banned animal fat.
</P>
<P>
The Farm Ministry launched a supervision over 350 chicken farms
that may have used the contaminated feed and in late May found
dioxin in chicken meat and eggs.
</P>
<P>
The contamination scandal has aroused strong reactions across
the European Union countries. France and Sweden have decided to
stop chicken imports from Belgium while Germany is considering
embargo against Belgian poultry.
</P>
<P>
The EU is also expected to announce the withdrawal from the 15
EU countries of the poultry products by 416 Belgian farms using
feed containing dioxin.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Inflation Declines by 0.28 Percent in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia registered a 0.28 percent
deflation or negative inflation in May, the country's third month
of deflation in a row, according to the Central Bureau of
Statistics (BPS).
</P>
<P>
"The negative monthly inflation rate was primarily caused by a
1.35 percent decline in the prices of basic food commodities,"
Chief of the BPS Sugito Suwito said.
</P>
<P>
He said a 0.15 percent decline in the prices of processed
foods, beverages, cigarettes and tobacco and a 1.03 percent drop
in the prices of clothing had contributed to the deflation.
</P>
<P>
"But the deflation rate is slowing particularly as prices of
other commodities, especially rice, have started to increase,"
Sugito was quoted by The Jakarta Post Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He added that prices in the housing, health, education,
recreation, sports, and telecommunications and transportation
sectors inflated in May.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia posted a deflation rate of 0.18 percent in March, and
0.68 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
Sugito said that the relatively peaceful campaigning by the 48
political parties ahead of the June 7 general election and the
undisturbed distribution sector had helped in preventing price
rises.
</P>
<P>
The relatively stable exchange rate of the rupiah against the
U.S. dollar also contributed to the monthly deflation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sugito, however, declined to confirm whether the government
inflation target of 10 percent by the end of the 1999/2000 fiscal
year ending March would be attainable.
</P>
<P>
"There's still uncertainty surrounding the country's political
condition over the next six months," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government had projected an inflation target of 17 percent
for the current fiscal year, but has recently revised it to 10
percent following positive developments in the country's
macroeconomic picture.
</P>
<P>
"Looking at the production side, things are much better than
last year, therefore if there are no disturbances in distribution,
I believe this year's inflation could fall to a single digit
figure," Sugito added.

<HEADLINE> China Mounts Campaign to Protect Buddhist Statues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- China is mounting an extensive
campaign to reduce heavy pollution of more than 50,000 ancient
Buddhist statues in the Yungang Grottos in the northern Shanxi
Province.
</P>
<P>
Local government sources cited the major threat as dust and
sulfur dioxide created by coal trucks streaming along an adjacent
highway. They noted that dust particles and emissions blacken and
seriously deteriorate the beautiful statues built in the 4th
century.
</P>
<P>
Every day, some 16,000 coal trucks travel the highway 300
meters from the grottos which are located in a major coal
production center.
</P>
<P>
UNESCO is currently considering a bid to include the Yungang
Grottos on its list of World Cultural Heritages.
</P>
<P>
The central government plans spend 200 million yuan (25 million
US dollars) to construct a bypass which will reroute coal trucks
some 10 kilometers from the grottos.
</P>
<P>
A tree-lined special tourist highway to the grottos is
currently under construction. Coal trucks will be prohibited from
using the new artery.
</P>
<P>
Some 10,000 artisans completed the Yungang Grottos over a 60
year period. Most of the statues are housed in caves dug in the
face of a cliff stretching one kilometer. The largest statue is 17
meters high and the smallest is only two centimeters.
</P>
<P>
The artistic and academic value of the relics equals similar
works at Dunhuang on the Silk Road and at Longmen in Luoyang, a
major ancient city in central China.

<HEADLINE> Ku Klux Klan Infiltrates Australia: Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The notorious white supremacist
group Ku Klux Klan (KKK) in the United States has set up branches
in three leading states in Australia, two major Australian
newspapers reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald and Melbourne-based daily newspaper
The Age, said that through Australian citizen Peter Coleman, the
KKK had set up branches in Australia's most populous states of New
South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, with a growing membership
base of about 70 members.
</P>
<P>
Coleman, formerly a member of the Australian Nationalist
Movement, a racist group, is now a member of the anti-Asian
immigrant One Nation Party.
</P>
<P>
But One Nation Party National Director David Ettridge, on
hearing of Coleman's Klan ties, told Melbourne-based radio 3AW
Wednesday that he had immediately expelled Coleman from the party.
</P>
<P>
Coleman told the newspapers that he was happy "to shout from
the rooftops" that he was head of the racist organization.
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is for a white Australia, a fair Australia," he was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The newspapers ran photographs of Klan members in full KKK
outfits in a Sydney meeting house.
</P>
<P>
Barry E Black, an "Imperial Wizard" of the KKK, told 3AW Radio
from the U.S. Wednesday that the KKK was setting up in Australia
because it wanted white Australians to be proud of their heritage
and "wake up."
</P>
<P>
He said he had been in touch with Coleman several times and was
planning to come to Australia sometime this year.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, there have been a series of KKK-style
attacks on aborigines in Queensland, east Australia, but local
police have denied the existence a Klan presence.
</P>
<P>
There are about 300,000 black-skinned aborigines in Australia.

BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special plane from the Chinese
People's Liberation Army Air Force departed an airport in the
western suburbs of Beijing this morning bound for northwest
China's Qinghai Province to transport a French tourist suffering
from an acute illness to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Jean Escalon, 63, accompanied by his nephew Cancel Fradirec,
arrived in Golmud, a city in northwest Qinghai Province during a
bicycle tour. On May 31, however, Escalon felt a sharp pain in his
lower back.
</P>
<P>
Escalon was immediately hospitalized in Golmud, with a
preliminary diagnosis indicating he was suffering from renal colic
resulting from kidney stones.
</P>
<P>
The hospital was unable to alleviate the pain and his nephew
requested assistance from Asia Emergency Assistance (AEA)
International PTE Limited. AEA consulted with relevant departments
and it was decided that the PLA Air Force would transfer Escalon
to Beijing for further medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
Escalon and his nephew planned to cycle to Lhasa, the capital
of southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region. The only Qinghai
land route leading to Lhasa runs through Golmud, a city some 2,000
km from Beijing by air.

<HEADLINE> Disaster Prevention Meeting Starts in Costa Rica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Some 500 government officials and
experts from 30 countries of the American continent opened a four-
day meeting here Tuesday on the International Decennium for the
Reduction of Natural Disasters.
</P>
<P>
The agenda includes the evaluation of risks, prevention
programs, exchange of information, and strengthening of health and
education institutions in the region.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican Acting President Astrid Fishel said in his speech
that Latin America and the Caribbean are frequently hit by natural
catastrophes, with extensive direct and indirect damages.
</P>
<P>
During the last 27 years, natural disasters have caused an
average of more than 4,000 deaths every year on the American
continent, affecting half a million people and leading to damages
of two billion U.S. dollars on a yearly basis, according to
reports from the Economic Commission for Latin America and the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
Central America is not a region of isolated countries, Fishel
noted, but a group of nations "united in the grief of the great
tragedy caused by hurricane Mitch." The hurricane ravaged the
region between last October and November, leaving some 10,000 dead,
hundreds of thousands of homeless, and incalculable other damages.
</P>
<P>
Central American authorities warned that the hurricane season
of this year, which started Tuesday, might be more intense and
dangerous than that of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Romania Not to Join NATO's Ground Forces in Kosovo: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Foreign Minister Andrei
Plesu stressed here Tuesday that Romania would by no means
participate in NATO's ground military operation in Kosovo,
Yugoslavia, but would be willing to send peacekeeping troops after
the war.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Mediafax, Plesu said that his country was
deeply concerned that NATO was likely to send in combatant ground
forces to Kosovo, a southern Serbian province mostly inhabited by
independence-seeking ethnic Albanians, adding that ground
operation would cause heavy casualties.
</P>
<P>
The minister emphasized that even if NATO, which has conducted
air strikes against Yugoslavia for more than 60 days, requests
Romania to join in ground military actions in its neighbor, it
would on no account do it.
</P>
<P>
However, he said Romania would give a positive reply if the
military alliance asked it to dispatch a noncombatant force into
the troubled Serbian province to help peacekeeping after the end
of the war, but the Romanian team would not exceed 250 soldiers
under a parliamentary resolution passed last October.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian minister complained that NATO's continuous bombing
of Yugoslavia inflicted severe economic loss upon his country,
with foreign trade and tourism bearing the brunt.
</P>
<P>
Plesu cited the latest figures estimated by various departments
as showing Romania has suffered a total of 850 million U.S.
dollars in economic loss this year caused by the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
He urged the international community to find out an effective
way to compensate.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan students have been
warned against offers for entry into British universities at
exorbitant prices, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
They said that Sri Lankans domiciled in London have reported
that a group of international racketeers have been making such
offers to students from developing countries, particularly in Asia
and Africa.
</P>
<P>
Based in India, Singapore and Hong Kong, the agents of these
racketeers offer places in British universities for students to
follow courses in accountancy, finance and management science.
</P>
<P>
The students are asked to pay exorbitant fees to obtain a
letter of confirmation from the universities concerned so as to
obtain the necessary visas for travel to Britain.
</P>
<P>
It is only after arrival in Britain that the students realize
they had been duped and had paid excessive fees to the agents.
</P>
<P>
Officials warned parents who spend their life's savings on a
better future for their children not to fall prey to these
international racketeers.
</P>
<P>
Parents and students should be extra careful in remitting money
for international study courses here or abroad, they added.

<HEADLINE> Moldova, Ukraine Agree on Boundary Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Moldova and Ukraine reached a
final agreement on their controversial boundary demarcation
Tuesday in the Moldovan capital of Chisinau, the Moldovan News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, reached by an inter-governmental mixed committee
between the two countries, settled their seven-year-old land
disputes and paved the way for the signing of a final boundary
pact by their presidents next month, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Moldova will receive a piece of land 100
meter wide on its south, which extended the length of the Danube
River flowing through Moldovan territory to 800 meters from 700
meters.
</P>
<P>
In return, Moldova agreed to cede to Ukraine a seven-kilometer
railway section near the village of Palanca, which was built by
Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
The two countries agreed to swap two pieces of land of the same
size near the city of Basarabeasca, to ensure the normal run of
their railways in that area.
</P>
<P>
Moldova and Ukraine delimited their boundaries temporarily in
early 1990s when they won independence from the former Soviet
Union. Since then, negotiations on boundary demarcation had made
little progress.
</P>
<P>
They are scheduled to officially sign a boundary pact during
Moldovan President Kirillovich Luchinsky's visit to Ukraine in
July, announced Moldovan Deputy Prime Minister Nicolae Andronic
and Ukrainian Prime Minister Sergei Tigipko Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> FBI Hunts Hackers Who Attack Government Web Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) is hunting the computer hackers who attacked
five government Web sites recently, FBI and Justice Department
officials announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"It's time-consuming and takes a lot of spade work, but we can
track down many of these hackers, and that's going on now," FBI
spokesman Frank Scafidi said.
</P>
<P>
"We'll catch a few, no matter how deep they hide in their
basements. Someone will go to jail for some real time. That will
have impact," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hackers who cause 5,000 dollars damage in one year can be
charged and sentenced to five years in prison, said Scott Charney,
head of the Justice Department's computer crime section.
</P>
<P>
Merely trespassing on a government computer, without
authorization and without causing a loss, can also bring up to one
year in jail.
</P>
<P>
Annoyed by the recent wave of attacks, White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart warned Tuesday that hackers who targeted federal
Internet sites would be caught and punished.
</P>
<P>
"For those who think that this is some sort of sport, I think (
it will be) less fun when the authorities do catch up with them...
and these people are prosecuted," he said.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, hackers attacked Web sites of the Department
of Energy, the FBI, the Senate, the Interior Department and the
White House.
</P>
<P>
The Web sites of the Interior Ministry and a federal super-
computer laboratory in Idaho were vandalized by hackers Monday
because of a related investigation of the FBI.
</P>
<P>
Computer crimes are increasing in recent years in the United
States as computer literacy grows.
</P>
<P>
A 1999 computer crime survey made by the Computer Security
Institute and the FBI's San Francisco office found that system
penetration by outsiders increased for the third year. Such
intrusions were reported by 30 percent of the 521 computer
security professionals surveyed.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia registered an overall
trade surplus of 6,593.4 million U.S. dollars in January-April
1999, according to The Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS).
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's exports in the period totaled 13,912.3 million U.S.
dollars while its imports were recorded at 7,318.9 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The export figure, however, was lower by 13.95 percent than
that recorded for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
During the first four months of this year, the country's
non-oil exports dropped by 14.79 percent from 13,380.2 million
U.S. dollars to 11,401.4 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The country's oil exports were also down by 27.45 percent to
204.7 million U.S. dollars while gas exports were down by 21.41
percent to 1,113 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Imports during January-April amounted to 7,318.9 million U.S.
dollars, a drop of 19.82 percent compared with the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the BPS Sugito Suwito said the decline in the
country's imports was due to a drop in the value of
non-oil/non-gas imports.
</P>
<P>
Imports of commodities were down by 9.07 percent from 1,765.3
million U.S. dollars to 1,605.2 million U.S. dollars. Imports of
raw materials and capital goods also declined.
</P>
<P>
However, oil and gas imports rose by 9.28 percent from 175.6
million U.S. dollars to 191.9 million U.S. dollars, he was quoted
by national newspapers Wednesday as saying.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Hold Mid-Year Gems Emporium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The state-run Myanmar Gems
Enterprise (MGE) will hold a mid-year gems emporium here in
October to put on sale the country's locally produced gems, jade,
pearl and jewelry through the tender system or competitive
bidding, the New Light of Myanmar said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Local private entrepreneurs may also sell their gemstones and
jewelry at the state-sponsored emporium, the MGE was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to promote gems sales, Myanmar has held gems
emporiums in the capital annually since 1964 with additional
mid-year ones introduced since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The annual gems emporium in March this year fetched 6.3 million
U.S. dollars, while the last mid-year one held last October gained
4.29 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The country earned a total of 271.3 million dollars from the
past 36 annual and seven mid-year gems emporiums.
</P>
<P>
The emporiums have attracted hundreds of gems merchants from
over a dozen countries and regions, mostly from China's Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region, Thailand, Japan and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The emporiums also draw gems traders from a number of local
private companies.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, a well-known producer of jade, ruby and sapphire in
the world, is striving to create a systematic gem market in line
with its market-oriented economic system introduced in late 1988.
</P>
<P>
In addition to permitting the local private sector to mine and
process gems in the country, the government has also set up joint
ventures with companies from Thailand, Malaysia and Israel to
carry out gems extraction and processing.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to send 300 workers to Libya This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will send 300 workers to
Libya this year to boost labor cooperation between the two
countries, according to the Thai Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The plan was part of the outcome from last week's visit by
Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan to Libya.
</P>
<P>
An official at the Thai Foreign Ministry was quoted Wednesday
by the Bangkok Post as saying that Thai workers will be employed
in an ambitious man-made river construction project operated by a
South Korean company which could take 10 years to complete.
</P>
<P>
The new labor quota will add to some 6,500 Thai laborers
currently working in Libya as truck drivers, mechanics and
construction workers.
</P>
<P>
Surin was the first high-ranking representative from Asia to
visit Libya after the United Nations Security Council temporarily
lifted the 1992 sanctions against Libya on April 5, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolution followed Tripoli's move in the same month
to hand over to an international tribunal two Libyan suspects in
the 1988 terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie,
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
In the area of economic cooperation, Surin asked Libya to buy
more Thai goods to correct a trade deficit with Bangkok.

<HEADLINE> Jakarta Stock Exchange Ready For Millennium Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The president of the Jakarta Stock
Exchange (JSX), Mas Achmad Daniri, said the exchange was nearly
year 2000 compliant, the Jakarta Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Almost 100 percent of the hardware in the exchange's
infrastructure is Y2K compliant," Daniri was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, he said some minor problems in a few areas still
required further attention.
</P>
<P>
"Only some minor areas need fine-tuning," he said, adding that
the exchange was working with an Australian Y2K auditor firm.
</P>
<P>
The exchange's management has now turned its attention to
helping exchange members and listed companies reach Y2K
compliance.
</P>
<P>
According to the exchange's latest bulletin, of 46 exchange
members, only 20 were 100 percent Y2K compliant, and others were
between 75 percent to 25 percent compliant.
</P>
<P>
But the bulletin said most of the companies listed on the JSX
were nearly Y2K compliant.
</P>
<P>
As the next millennium approaches and with the press
progressively reporting the threats behind the millennium bug,
many local companies have become increasingly anxious about the
future of their computerized operations.
</P>
<P>
Y2K will become a problem on January 1, 2000, during which many
software in the world could be confusing and malfunctioning
because the software had not been set for programs after December
31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Many computer application programs have set two-digit dates
such as "00" to "99" of 1900 to 1999, so that in 2000 the
computers will read "00", and this will cause global confusion.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Tourist Arrivals in Indonesia Up This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- About 1.25 million foreign tourists
visited Indonesia in the first four months of this year, up by
5.22 percent from the corresponding period last year, according to
the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS).
</P>
<P>
Foreign tourists entered Indonesian territory through 13
gateways. Among the gateways, Mataram, capital of West Nusa
Tenggara province, saw the highest increase in the number of
foreign tourist arrivals with 53.36 percent, followed by Ngurah
Rai (Bali) with 19.97 percent and Batam (Riau) with 19.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Most of the gateways registered an increase in the number of
tourist arrivals. But Adi Sumarmo gateway in Solo, Central Java,
Hasanudin gateway in Ujungpandang, South Sulawesi and Entikong
gateway in Pontianak, West Kalimantan, all suffered a nearly 60
percent drop.
</P>
<P>
Fluctuations in the number of tourist arrivals were closely
related to social, political and security developments at home,
Chief of the BPS Sugito Suwito said.
</P>
<P>
Citing an example, he said, the number of tourist arrivals in
April 1999 dropped 10.24 percent to 305,814 compared with the
previous month following rumors that political tensions in the
country would heighten prior to the June 7 polls.
</P>
<P>
Sugito also said the room occupancy rate at starrated hotels in
10 tourist destinations in April was 40.86 percent, up by 2.22
percent from the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The number of foreign tourists visiting Indonesia last year was
3.51 million, down by 16.97 percent from the previous year, Sugito
was quoted by Antara News Agency Wednesday as saying.

<HEADLINE> China Consumes More Gold in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- China's gold consumption increased
in the first quarter this year compared with the same period last
year, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Gold demand on the mainland was 55 tons in the first three
months, up five percent on an annual basis, according to the World
Gold Council, an international organization established and funded
by leading gold mining companies around the world.
</P>
<P>
The latest report from the council indicates that the increased
sales of gold in China came from the jewelry sector.
</P>
<P>
The year 1999 symbolizes eternity, encouraging weddings during
the Chinese Lunar New Year, which fueled the consumption of gold
jewelry, the report said. Sales were also boosted during the time
as the Year of Rabbit makes gold gift more auspicious and promotes
rabbit motif collections as well as jewelry designs.
</P>
<P>
"It showed an upward trend in gold consumption because of the
availability of fashionable gold jewelry," Liu Shan'en, deputy
director of the Gold Economic Development Research Center was
quoted by the newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
"People can afford a well-designed quality ring with a price of
several hundred yuan (8.28 yuan is equal to one dollar)," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Official figures showed that sales of gold jewelry were strong
in most Chinese cities.

LISBON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Portugal's economy is expected to
grow by three percent this year, 0.3 to 0.5 points lower than the
target set by the government, the Central Bank predicted in a

<HEADLINE> Slovakia Reinstates Import Customs Tariff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Slovak government decided on
Tuesday to reinstate a 7 percent customs tariff on all imported
commodities so as to improve the country's current poor economic
situation.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the restoration was merely a temporary measure, the
government announced at the same time that the tariff is expected
to be reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2000 and further down to
3 percent on July 1, 2000. And in early 2001, it would be
completely abolished.
</P>
<P>
Slovakia adopted the zero customs tariff policy on October 1,
1998. However the country's economic growth slowed down in the
following seven months. Financial deficits were reported and
foreign trade deficit remained high. The rate of exchange between
koruna and major western currencies countries sank to a record low.
</P>
<P>
Facing the severe situation, the government had to adopt a
series of austerity measures including the restoration of import
customs tariff, through which, the government is expected to
increase its revenue by 10.1 billion more korun (224.4 million U.S.
dollars) this year.

the ban on Bulgarian volleyball clubs from taking part in
international events, the FIVB press office said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Ralph Andressen, Vice-President of the FIVB, attended the
BVF general meeting, held May 30 in Sofia, which elected a new
management. He confirmed that the meeting followed the FIVB
regulations.
</P>
<P>
The BVF general meeting elected Agriculture Minister Ventsislav
Vurbanov as BVF president and the newly-elected governing council
elected Tsvetan Pavlov as BVF secretary general.
</P>
<P>
The ban stemmed from quarrels that started in December 1998. On
December 23, 1998, Dimiter Zlatanov was elected BVF president, but
FIVB did not recognize the new leadership and twice confirmed that
Vladimir Zayakov was the only BVF chairman which it recognized.
</P>
<P>
As the representatives of the two federations did not reach an
agreement, on March 24 FIVB imposed a one-month ban on all
Bulgarian clubs from participation in international volleyball
events, which it later extended till May 31.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Orders Intensified Drive Against Youth Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton,
concerned over youth violence in the country, ordered a government
investigation Tuesday into the link of entertainment with youth
violence.
</P>
<P>
"Our children are being fed a dependable daily dose of violence
" that amounts to the typical child witnessing 40,000 play murders
and 200,000 dramatized acts of violence by his 18th birthday,
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Such a barrage blurs the line between "fantasy and reality
violence" for too many young people, Clinton said when announcing
the order at a White House event as the latest initiative to fight
against youth violence after the campus shooting incident in
Colorado in April.
</P>
<P>
"I know this stuff sells, but that does not make it right," he
said. "The time has come to show some restraint."
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission will
spend one million dollars and take 18 months to carry out the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the federal investigators will "study the extent
to which the video game, music and movie makers do actually market
violence to children" and whether those industries only laxly
restrict sales to minors.
</P>
<P>
Also White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the study could
provide a basis for new laws or regulations, and left open the
possibility of using subpoenas to make companies reveal
information about their advertising.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's announcement came three weeks after he convened a
summit meeting of the industries of movies, video games, Internet
and guns to combat youth violence.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Economist Francisco Flores, a
member of the ruling Republican Nationalist Alliance (Arena), was
sworn in on Tuesday as the 34th President of El Salvador for the
next five years.
</P>
<P>
The new President said in his inaugural address that he would
encourage the business circle to create jobs, the only choice
against poverty in the country.
</P>
<P>
Flores, 39, who won in March the presidential elections against
other six candidates, succeeds his party comrade Armando Calderon
Sol.
</P>
<P>
El Salvador registered a 7.5 percent unemployment rate last
year, while poverty affects more than half of its 5.6 million
population.
</P>
<P>
A long civil war between guerrillas and a succession of
military and U.S. supported rightist governments plunged the
country into poverty and claimed lives of more than 75,000 people
from 1979 to 1992.

<HEADLINE> Colombian President to Secure Release of Abducted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President
Andres Pastrana is returning home Tuesday from abroad earlier than
scheduled to seek the release of 60 people held by rebels.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here said the president cut short his visit "for the
security of the country."
</P>
<P>
Pastrana will go to Cali, southwest of Colombia to attend a
security meeting in order to achieve the release of the people.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana had been in Canada since Sunday, when guerrillas from
Colombia's second-largest rebel group, the National Liberation
Army (ELN), seized 144 worshippers from a church in the western
city of Cali and trucked them into the nearby mountains.
</P>
<P>
ELN abandoned 84 of its captives hours later to pursuing troops.
</P>
<P>
It had not publicly taken responsibility for the abduction,
which shocked even the Colombians accustomed to frequent guerrilla
kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
Observers here called the abduction a "desperate call for
attention" by the rebel group.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said ELN appeared attempting to persuade
President Pastrana to take it more seriously in talks to end the
civil war.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana has started peace talks with the largest rebel group --
15,000-member Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, but attempts
to talk with ELN have failed.

<P>
PARIS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Andre Agassi of the United States
entered the semifinals of the French Open after beating Marcelo
Filippini of Uruguay in straight sets here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Agassi barely broke a sweat in winning the match 6-2, 6-2, 6-0
in just 72 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The 140th-ranked Filippini said a strained abdominal muscle
limited his serving motion and hurt him on every backhand. But he
admitted that even if he were well, Agassi probably still would
have destroyed him.
</P>
<P>
Agassi next will play Slovakian dominik Hrbaty who eliminated
former world number one Marcelo Rios in four sets in the quarters.
</P>
<P>
Hrbaty has knocked off two top players so far in the French:
top-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia, the 1996 champion, in
straight sets in the second round, and former No. 1 Marcelo Rios
of Chile in four sets in the quarters.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Expects 3.7 Pct GNP Growth This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The gross national product (GNP) of
the Philippines is expected to surge to 3.7 percent this year from
only 0.1 percent in 1998, the Journal newspaper said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The uptick would exceed the 3.5 percent growth targeted under
the country's program with the International Monetary Fund, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu was quoted as saying that
the gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to hit three percent
as projected by government planners earlier.
</P>
<P>
He said the forecast was based on actual growth performance in
the first quarter this year which "surprised" the government when
GNP grew by two percent and GDP grew by 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu vowed that the pump-priming activities of the
government, which commits public spending in so-called
growth-sensitive areas of agriculture, infrastructure, low-cost
housing, education and health, would not be stopped.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue with pump-priming until the private sector
has responded in a positive way," he said.

<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- An e-commerce network for the
automobile sector was inaugurated Tuesday amid high expectations
of driving China's auto industry to roll faster and move closer to
international standards.
</P>
<P>
The China Automotive Rainbow Net (CARN) is designed to enable
companies in the sector, including manufacturers, auto parts
supplies and dealers, to conduct bidding, auctions and business
negotiations through the net, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
It will also provide an electronic data interchange service so
that manufacturers can purchase parts and materials, establish a
sales management system and supervise branches nationwide.
</P>
<P>
China's major auto producers, such as First Automobile Works,
Dongfeng Motor Group and Shanghai Automotive (Group) Corp. have
expressed an interest to use e-commerce to reduce costs for
purchases, optimize the structure of inventories, slash marketing
costs and improve service efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The system is also linked to e-commerce networks in the United
States, Japan and Europe, with China Construction Bank and China
Merchants Bank acting as the clearing banks for business conducted
through the net.

<HEADLINE> Pacers Seek to Draw Even with Knicks in Eastern Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- After losing at home in the
playoffs for the first time in the Larry Bird era, the Indiana
Pacers seek to draw even with the New York Knicks tonight in the
Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
New York, the first eighth-seeded team to reach the conference
finals, snapped Indiana's 12-game postseason home winning streak
with a 93-90 victory in the series opener.
</P>
<P>
Indiana became the first team since the 1993 Chicago Bulls to
sweep the first two rounds of the playoffs, but squandered a five-
point lead in the final 2:20 on Sunday. Patrick Ewing scored six
of his 16 points down the stretch to lead the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
But the loss apparently has not shaken Indiana's confidence.
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is a team to beat us four times," said Pacers
point guard Mark Jackson. "When we play our type of basketball,
we're not going to be beat."
</P>
<P>
The Knicks have won six straight playoff games, including four
in a row on the road. New York is 5-1 away from home in the
palyoffs after going just 8-17 during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
After tonight's game, the teams will enjoy a three-day break
before the series shifts to New York on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Portland Trail Blazers have three days to regroup after
dropping the first two games of the Western Conference finals in
San Antonio.

<HEADLINE> Cavaliers Fire Coach Mike Fratello </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- After missing the playoffs for
only the third time this decade, the Cleveland Cavaliers today
fired coach Mike Fratello.
</P>
<P>
The shakeup in the Cavaliers' organization continued when
longtime general manager Wayne Embry stepped down and was replaced
by Jim Paxson, the team's vice president of basketball operations.
</P>
<P>
There were rumors of friction between Fratello and Embry, but
the pair was able to work together for six seasons. The Cavaliers
made the postseason four times during the duo's tenure but never
advanced past the first round.
</P>
<P>
"Although Coach Fratello has at least one more year on his
contract, we feel it is best to move forward under a new floor
leader right now," said Cavaliers owner Gordon Gund. "Because of
that and also to enable Coach Fratello to move forward, we have
made this change at this time."
</P>
<P>
Cleveland won 47 games three times under Fratello, who had the
team play a slow-down style to overcome a lack of offensive talent.
The Cavaliers led the league in defense during the 1996-97 season
but failed to make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
Fratello led Cleveland to a 248-212 record in six years at the
helm and owns a career coaching mark of 572-462. He coached
Atlanta for seven seasons from 1983-1990, leading the Hawks to
four straight 50-win seasons.

<HEADLINE> Manchester United to Unveil Bosnich Signing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Aston Villa's Mark Bosnich is poised
to complete a move to Old Trafford this week -- on a free transfer
under the Bosman ruling.
</P>
<P>
United chairman Martin Edwards said he was on the verge of
talks with Bosnich, but has insisted the deal is far from tied up.
</P>
<P>
"There is still a lot to do," Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
Bosnich hopes to sort out personal terms and complete a full
medical test after having preliminary meetings with Alex Ferguson
last week, when his fitness was also checked by the club's
backroom staff.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in The Mirror newspaper, Bosnich said: "I'll be
travelling to Manchester (on Tuesday) and I hope everything is
tied up quickly.
</P>
<P>
"I had preliminary talks on Friday and I've had the medical. I
will discover the results of those tests but I feel fine.
</P>
<P>
"Although I was out for four months last season I've been back
at 100% since then."
</P>
<P>
Bosnich has been criticised by Villa chairman Doug Ellis for
making the move, but the Australian has so far refused to hit back.
</P>
<P>
"Once everything is signed and sealed I will then have my say
about a number of things that have been going on," he said.
</P>
<P>
Replacing Old Trafford legend Peter Schmeichel will be no easy
task, especially after United's Treble success in the European Cup,
Premiership and FA Cup this season.
</P>
<P>
But Bosnich insists he is looking forward to the challenge,
saying: "That is the big bait for me. It's an opportunity I could
not turn my back on."
</P>
<P>
Bosnich played three first team games for United between 1989
and 1991 before returning to his native Australia to renew his
work permit.
</P>
<P>
He returned to England after marrying an Englishwoman but
instead of rejoining United he signed a two-year contract with
Villa in 1992.

WASHINGTON -- U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said on
Tuesday that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will
not compromise on its demand that the alliance be "at the core" of
any security force that enters Kosovo.

control structure that is NATO's in charge of any peacekeeping
operation," Cohen said.
</P>

Speaking to reporters after addressing a suburban Washington
high school, Cohen said that NATO is planning to put as many as 50,

<HEADLINE> Kinnear to Leave Wimbledon Football Club </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Joe Kinnear is set to step aside as
Wimbledon manager and pave the way for the appointment of Egil
Olsen, Dons chairman Sam Hammam revealed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kinnear, who missed the last two months of the season after
suffering a heart attack in March, has revealed he wants to manage
a bigger club, Hammam told BBC Radio 5 Live.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations have begun with former Norway coach Egil Olsen,
who is now in charge of part-timers Valerenga, Hammam added.
</P>
<P>
A deal could be struck within the next 24 hours to bring Olsen
to Selhurst Park -- as long as Wimbledon can negotiate a
compensation deal with Valerenga.
</P>
<P>
Kinnear -- the second longest-serving Premiership manager after
Alex Ferguson -- has not secured a new job and Hammam said he
would be staying with the Dons until his future has been resolved.
</P>
<P>
"It isn't the usual way a manager leaves a club -- this is
Wimbledon and we are doing it together," Hammam said.
</P>
<P>
Kinnear will play a part in the selection of the new manager
and will then help him settle into the club.
</P>
<P>
"Joe will stay with the club for as long as it takes and until
he finds the job he aspires to," Hammam added.
</P>
<P>
"He is part and parcel of what we are doing now and in the
future -- until such time as he finds a new job.
</P>
<P>
"It's all being done in the most loving way possible."
</P>
<P>
Hammam dismissed reports that the decision to appoint a new
manager had anything to do with Kinnear's recent ill health.
</P>
<P>
Wimbledon failed to win a match following his heart attack and
they slumped to 16th place -- their lowest Premiership finish.
</P>
<P>
"Joe has made a 100% recovery," Hammam said. "In fact he is
much better than before (the heart attack).
</P>
<P>
"I was overjoyed when I heard that Joe had been given a clean
bill of health -- but I was heartbroken when he dropped the
bombshell that he wants to leave Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
"Joe is more than my manager, he is my greatest pal -- not just
in the game but in my whole life and I couldn't believe what he
was telling me.
</P>
<P>
"But I must stress that no other club is involved and if and
when it happens I will help Joe achieve his aspirations and will
personally drive Joe to his first day of training wherever it is.
That is how much I love the man."
</P>
<P>
Olsen's arrival at Wimbledon is likely to be secured within the
next day or so, according to Norwegian television station TV2.
</P>
<P>
"If the two clubs can agree on a compensation, and that could
happen this evening, Olsen could be on his way to London tomorrow,
" revealed Fin Gnatt, sports editor of TV2.
</P>
<P>
"He (Olsen) didn't mention Joe Kinnear at all. I don't know
what Kinnear's position would be -- but it is the full managerial
position we are talking about as far as Egil Olsen is concerned.
</P>
<P>
"He (Olsen) told us that there were two teams in the world that
he had always dreamed of managing -- one was the Brazilian
national team and the other was Wimbledon," Gnatt added.

<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended mixed
Tuesday in a mixed bag of economic signals.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 36.52 at
10,596.26. The Dow fell as mush as 150 points earlier in the
trading.
</P>
<P>
But the Standard and Poor's 500 index was down 7.58 at
1,294.26 and the technology heavy Nasdaq index was down 58.94 at
2,412,03.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board, a prominent research group, reported
that the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, a key gauge of
future U.S. economic activity, fell 0.1 percent to 107.1 in
April, suggesting some softening in the economy,
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department also reported that construction
spending fell by a sharp 2.4 percent in April, the biggest
monthly decline in more than five years. The results indicated
that the economy is not overheating.
</P>
<P>
But the National Association of Purchasing Management
reported strong prices rises in raw materials in May for the
first time in 16 months, renewing fears among investors about
higher interest rates. The Federal Reserve warned two weeks
ago that it would raise interest rates to cool off the economy
if inflation is building up.
</P>
<P>
The late afternoon rally around cyclical stocks pulled the
Dow index out the negative territory and moved it into positive
one. Among the leading Dow components were Aluminum company
Alcoa and international Paper.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The NYSE composite
index fell 0.98 at 621.28 and the American Stock Exchange
composite index fell 2.63 at 776.11. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 1.22 at 437.46.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,568 down, 1,422 up and
544 unchanged.

<P>
NYSE volume increased to 681.99 million shares from 648.93
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> NATO Jets Repeatedly Bomb North Albanian Border Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- NATO fighter jets Tuesday repeatedly
dropped guided bombs on the Albanian side of border near the
Morina border crossing.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian news agency ATA reported that NATO warplanes first
attacked the Morina village, about 500 meters from the border
crossing, when the day was about to break.
</P>
<P>
At least three government defensive bunkers, in which Albanian
borderguards sheltered against Serb shellings just a day ago, were
destroyed in the early-morning NATO attack.
</P>
<P>
Five 10-meter-deep huge craters created by the NATO bombs
dotted the hilly terrains bordering Kosovo, a southern Serbian
province of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Telephone lines were damaged.
</P>
<P>
The ATA said that two Albanian soldiers suffered minor injuries
when one bomb landed near their position.
</P>
<P>
The English marking on a piece of bomb fragments --"For Use on
MK-82.Fin Guided Bomb" indicated that it was the work of NATO.
</P>
<P>
Before noon, NATO warplanes came back again, hit the same area
with at least seven guided bombs, and sent about 50 people,
including Albanian soldiers and some 20 journalists running for
shelter in panic.
</P>
<P>
The puzzled 1,500 villagers, and some Kosovo refugees who
stayed with them, started to evacuate from the Morina village this
morning.
</P>
<P>
They had managed to stay in the village despite Serb artillery
pounding but they were now under bombing of NATO, which they
believed was on their side.
</P>
<P>
NATO has been reportedly helping the Kosovo Liberation Army
(KLA) in the raging fierce fightings over the past week between
KLA and Serb troops the nearby hills on the Kosovo side of border.
</P>
<P>
KLA rebels, seen by Belgrade as terrorists, have been trying to
open a supply corridor running from the border area of Albania to
Prizren, a Kosovo city about 30 kilometers from the Morina border
crossing.
</P>
<P>
As each day passes, the situation on the northeast border of
Albania becomes increasingly tense and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
To review the worsening situation on the border, Albanian
President Rexhep Meidani called an emergency meeting on Monday
night. At the meeting, it was decided to intensify military
actions against what the Albanians say Serb provocations.

<HEADLINE> British Committee Says NATO Changing Tactics in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- A British committee said on Tuesday
that NATO had changed its tactics on Yugoslavia and was violating
Geneva Conventions.
</P>
<P>
"NATO has changed tack in recent days. It has intensified its
bombing of civilian targets," Alice Mahon, Parliament Member(MP)
from the Labor Party who chairs the Committee for Peace in the
Balkans, said in a statement issued on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The statement said NATO "is now violating the Geneva
Conventions on the protection of civilian life on a routine daily

</P>
<P>
"The slaughter of 50 innocent civilians in 24 hours by NATO now
does not even produce an apology from (NATO spokesman) Jamie
Shea," Mahon said while commenting on the bombing by NATO on
Monday of a hospital in Surdulica, which resulted in at least 18
deaths.
</P>
<P>
"NATO's new strategy seems to be to terrorize and Brutalize the
civilian population of Yugoslavia," she said.
</P>
<P>
Alice Mahon, who has just returned from the NATO Parliamentary
Assembly in Warsaw, also said that NATO's military actions against
Yugoslavia were widely criticized in NATO countries.

NEW YORK, June 1 (Xinhua) -- A leading U.S. business computing
company and a U.S. consulting firm on Tuesday announced alliance
to create the borderless E-commerce infrastructure for Japanese
companies.
</P>
<P>
The two U.S. firms are Computer Associates International Inc.

</P>
<P>
The two plan to initially focus on providing solutions and
services for Japan's financial services, logistics and
telecommunication industries, CA sources said.
</P>
<P>
The finance business arena requires highly intensive
transaction processing services for Web-based electronic
settlement which must be tightly integrated with a well-managed
information technology infrastructure.

Japanese firms and organizations are increasingly seen deploy
distributed systems for full-scale E-commerce and other
mission-critical applications for success in today's digital
economy.

<HEADLINE> More U.S. Households Expected to Be Banking Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, June 1 (Xinhua) -- More than 32 million households
in the United States are expected to be banking online by 2003,
according to a research released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Online banking is becoming fast a convenient functionality in
the country craved by the growing horde of Internet users. In
1998, there were already 6.6 million U.S. households banking
online, said the U.S. market research firm International Data
Corporation (IDC).
</P>
<P>
Describing factors driving the explosive growth in online
banking, IDC said that there has been a proliferation of low-cost
PCs and other networking devices in the home market, which is
causing a surge in the number of Internet users. "Because many of
the security concerns have been alleviated," the research firm
said, "these Internet users are becoming comfortable using the
Internet as a transaction-based medium."
</P>
<P>
The increasing number of banks offering Web-based banking
services is also triggering the market's growth. IDC estimates the
number of banks in the United States offering online services will
increase from 1,150 in 1998 to more than 15,800 by 2003, primarily
via the Web. These numbers represent 6 percent and 86 percent
respectively of all U.S. commercial banks and credit unions.
</P>
<P>
A strong link exists between banking, bill payments and the
Internet, IDC said. "Although there is still uncertainty in the
bill presentment market," the research firm said, "banks must
seize this tremendous opportunity in front of them. Online banking
may be the critical service that enables banks to maintain their
role as the dominant provider of financial services."

<HEADLINE> Schroeder: Substantial Progress on Kosovo Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Substantial progress has been achieved
in diplomatic negotiations to settle the Kosovo crisis, German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a late evening joint press conference with three
Kosovo mediators after their meeting at the Petersberg guest house
near Bonn, Schroeder said he was pleased that their talks were
"positive".
</P>
<P>
The three mediators are European Union (EU) envoy, Finnish
President Martti Ahtisaari, Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin, and
U.S. deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, Ahtisaari, Chernomyrdin and Talbott had held
another meeting on solving the Kosovo crisis. And Chernomyrdin is
due to fly to Belgrade together with Ahtisaari on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said he was hopeful that a joint statement with
Yugoslav leadership would be achieved in Chernomyrdin and
Ahtisaari's visit.
</P>
<P>
And again he underlined Russia's importance in seeking a
peaceful solution to Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
"A durable peace in Kosovo will never be possible without
Russian participation," said Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said he was "fully confident" after the meeting
with his partners. He stressed Russia must take part in the
international presence in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
What kind of achievement they will make in Belgrade during the
following days is now depending on the Yugoslav leadership, said
Ahtisaari.
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic negotiations must be based on current principles
raised by NATO and EU, he stressed, saying "I don't think we need
to bring anything new, and our negotiations are on the basis of
the principles that he has known."
</P>
<P>
More detailed mediating works are still needed to solve the
Kosovo crisis, but he and his partners have been fully prepared
for the exceedingly hard work, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing will prevent us from seeking a peaceful solution,"
said Ahtisaari.

<HEADLINE> Positive Forces Omened to Drive Global Consulting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

NEW YORK, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Consulting spending in the United
States is predicted to grow 14.8 percent to reach about 55 billion U.S.
dollars by 2003, a leading U.S. data provider said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Besides the strong U.S. market where the economy continues to
be robust, most global regions are expected to see the effects of
positive market drivers outweigh the negative ones, said the
Massachusetts-based International Data Corporation (IDC).
</P>
<P>
IDC termed the positive forces as those typically related to
mergers and acquisitions, deregulation and privatization,
technological advancement, restructuring, globalization and the
new digital economy.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing, government, communications and banking are the
biggest spenders on global consulting services, especially on
information technology(IT) consulting, said IDC in its latest
report on worldwide consulting Services 1996-2003.
</P>
<P>
Financial services, banking, retail and communications are seen
as some of the fastest-growing uses.
</P>
<P>
By type of consulting service, IT design and IT strategy
continue to represent the lion's share of the consulting market,
but services related to change management and business strategy
experience are growing the fastest.
</P>
<P>
These two consulting services are supported by a strong demand
for Internet services or E-commerce, customer relationship
management and supply chain management.
