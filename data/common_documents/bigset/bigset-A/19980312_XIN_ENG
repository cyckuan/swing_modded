<HEADLINE> Palestinian Faction Condemns Hebron killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Hebron Regional Committee
of Fatah Wednesday condemned the Tuesday shooting incident against
the Palestinian workers in Hebron and called on all Palestinians
to fight against Israeli military occupation.
</P>
<P>
In an announcement, Fatah, the main stream of the Palestinian
Liberation Organization, set Wednesday as the mourning day for the
three Palestinians killed by Israeli soliders Tuesday night near
the West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
It also set Thursday as a day of activities and clashes with
Jewish settlers and Israeli soldiers across the occupied
territories, and Saturday a day for a huge march by Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers opened fire at a van filled with Palestinian
workers at Tarkumia checkpoint near Hebron, killing three of
them. The fatalities were identified as Ghaleb Rajoub, a relative
of West Bank Preventive Security Chief Jibril Rajoub, Mohammed
Sharowna and Adnan Abu Zneid.
</P>
<P>
Israeli authorities on Wednesday admitted that the Israeli
soldiers should be responsible for the killing. Commander of the
Central Region of the Israel Defense Force (IDF) Uzi Dayan said
that interrogations have shown that the driver of the van was not
intended to hit one of the Israeli soldiers, but the car was on
high speed when crossing the checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
The killing incident has caused sharp criticism from all walks
of life of the Palestinians. Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat called it "a big crime against
Palestinian workers."
</P>
<P>
Israeli President Ezer Weizman and Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu phoned Arafat on Wednesday to express condolence for
those killed.
</P>
<P>
The killing incident also caused widespread protests in Hebron
and another West Bank city Ramallah on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In Hebron, local residents clashed with Israeli forces in
various parts of the city and its nearby areas and at least 50
Palestinians were injured by rubber bullets and tear gas fired by
the Israeli forces, witnesses told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
In Ramallah, students from the Birzeit University took to the
streets and clashed with the Israeli troops near Balou on
Ramallah-Nablus main road, and at least seven students were hurt
by rubber bullets.

business.
</P>
<P>
Lloyd briefed Albanian Foreign Minister Paskal Milo on Monday's

</P>
<P>
In a joint statement after the London meeting, the Contact

<HEADLINE> UAE President Calls for Lifting Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 11 (Xinhua) -- United Arab Emirates (UAE)
President Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al Nahyan Wednesday urged the
international community to lift economic sanctions against Iraq to
end the sufferings of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The UAE president said he hoped to "remove the darkness
covering the Iraqi people who should not be responsible for the
sanctions," the UAE's official Wam news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks during his talks with al Akhder al
Ibrahimi, visiting adviser of U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan,
the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has repeatedly called for the lifting of the economic
sanctions against Baghdad imposed by the United Nations since
1990 after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Abu Dhabi said late last month that the issue was the "next
step" on which the international community should focus its
efforts after the U.N. peacefully defused a crisis with Iraq on
arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has said that in the past seven years, hundreds of
thousands of Iraqi women and children have died for lack of food
and medicines caused by the U.N. sanctions.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania-Zambia-Railway (TAZARA)
provides Zambia with the most competitive route to the sea,
TAZARA managing director Kingston Mkandawire has said.
</P>
<P>
Zambian News Agency Wednesday quoted Mkandawire as saying here
that TAZARA has reduced the number of days to three from the
previous 11 for freight goods from Kapiri Mposhi, the end of the
China-built railway in Zambia, to Dar es Salaam seaport of
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The current cost and efficiency, he said, give the
1,860-kilometre railway a new lease of life to meet the challenge
in the freight business because it has learned from its past
performance.
</P>
<P>
TAZARA will do the best it can in terms of good business
partnership, he said.
</P>
<P>
From July this year all TAZARA employees will be paid in U.S.
Dollars equivalent in order to redress salary differences between
Zambians and Tanzanians, according to the director.
</P>
<P>
Salim Musona, Tanzanian Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of
Communication and Transport, has assured Zambia that the problem
of pilferage has been brought under control on TAZARA and Dar es
Salaam port.
</P>
<P>
The visiting Tanzanian official said his country has
reinforced security by increasing personnel to man the harbor as
well as control the movement of cargo.

WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton has
exempted Vietnam from a Cold War law that restricts trade
because of limit emigration, the White House said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The president based his decision on Vietnam's track record
of progress on emigration over the past 15 years and its
accelerated efforts in recent months," the White House said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said on Tuesday that Clinton signed a waiver
to the so-called Jackson-Vanik amendment, which prevents the
U.S. government from giving trade and investment funding to
nations that do not allow their citizens to emigrate or travel
abroad freely.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's decision will make Vietnam eligible for financial
backing from the U.S. Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private
Investment Corp, but does not grant it the Most Favored Nation
trade status.

<HEADLINE> ICRISAT to Expand Its Sorghum/Millet Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The India-based International
Crop Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) will,
beginning in September next year, transform the sorghum and
millet improvement program (SMIP) centered in Zimbabwe into a
network (SMINET).
</P>
<P>
ICRISAT director-general Shawki Barghouti Wednesday told the
Zimbabwe News Agency in Bulawayo, the country's second largest
city, that the change would necessitate the expansion of the
program to add other drought-resistant crops considered suitable
for southern Africa's arid and dry weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
Since its inception in 1984, the SMIP southern Africa region
center in Matopos, west Zimbabwe, researched and developed hybrid
varieties of sorghum and millet, but SMINET would also look at
groundnuts, pigeonpeas, chickpeas, pearl millet and other crop
varieties which are expected to improve food availability in the
region.
</P>
<P>
"SMINET will also carry out research in natural resource
management, soil and water conservation as well as modern and
sustainable methods of farming that preserve natural assets,"
Barghouti said.
</P>
<P>
"More scientists will be brought in to carry out research and
promote new crops and farming concepts at national level in all
the 14 Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Villagers Call for Control of Elephants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Villagers in southern Zambia
urged Wednesday the country's department of wildlife to control
elephants which are destroying their maize fields.
</P>
<P>
Mukuni ward councillor Eddie Singongi said in Livingstone on
half of the villagers in Mukuni area that the villagers are
concerned at the destruction of their crops and demand
compensation from the wildlife department.
</P>
<P>
"For the past few years elephants have been destroying our
crops. This time the elephants are back destroying our maize
fields, now we are demanding compensation because we shall
starve," Singongi said.
</P>
<P>
He said in the past the department of wildlife has always told
them that the elephants were international animals and Zambia
alone had no power to crop them.
</P>
<P>
But the villagers have put up another option in their request
that Mukuni village be made part of the Musi-Oa-Tunya park in
order to benefit from the proceeds realized from the sale of
government trophies and tourism in general for they live in the
same neighborhood with wildlife.
</P>
<P>
"We are faced with a predicament as our sweat and toil has
been wasted because we are not getting any spin-offs from the
elephants.
</P>
<P>
Another option of electrical fencing to deter the animals from
crossing to destroy crops was proposed though unpracticable.
</P>
<P>
The villagers have also requested for relief food saying that
they have no alternative but to turn to the government for
handouts to survive.

<HEADLINE> ILO Governing Body to Decide on Possible Declaration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The governing body of the
International Labor Organization (ILO) will make decisions on a
possible declaration on fundamental rights and elect a new ILO
director-general when it holds its 271st plenary session here on
March 23-27.
</P>
<P>
The declaration will be submitted to the next session of the
International Labor Conference in June 1998, the ILO said in a
press release Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Current ILO Director-General Michel Hansenne described the
declaration under discussion and an appropriate follow-up
mechanism as "the most significant endeavor for ensuring respect
for fundamental ILO standards since the adoption in 1945 of the
Declaration of Philadelphia".
</P>
<P>
He believed that the draft declaration would be central to
fulfilling the increasing hopes and expectations placed on the ILO
by the international community, notably in the aftermath of the
United Nations' World Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Beginning on March 12, the various committees of the ILO
governing body will examine such issues as freedom of association,
discrimination in employment and occupation and the future of ILO
technical cooperation programs to eliminate child labor, enhance
employment opportunities for women and combat poverty and social
exclusion, said the ILO.
</P>
<P>
Hansenne was elected ILO Director-General in 1989 and
re-elected to a second five-year term of office in 1994. His
current term expires in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
Two candidates for the election of the new director-general are
Ms Maria Nieves Roldan-Confesor of the Philippines and Mr Juan
Somavia of Chile, both submitted by their respective governments.
</P>
<P>
The voting will take place on March 23 by secret ballot. A
candidate receiving more than one-half of the 56 votes will win.

<HEADLINE> UNITA Admitted As Political Party in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government issued a
declaration here on Wednesday, acknowledging the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) as a legitimate
political party in the country.
</P>
<P>
The declaration also lifts the restriction on UNITA's
political and party activities within the national territory.
</P>
<P>
According to the declaration issued at the end of the standing
committee meeting of Angolan ministers, UNITA announced its
accomplishment of total demilitarization last Friday, based on
which the government made the decision.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka Peace Accord signed by Angola's warring parties in
November 1994, requires for UNITA's complete demilitarization to
become a political party and operate in line with the
constitution, especially the Political Party Act.
</P>
<P>
The declaration further announced that the government will
allow UNITA to be engaged in political activities under the new
agenda set by the joint committee for the peace process on March
6.
</P>
<P>
UNITA was the second large party and the biggest opposition
party in Angola. After the country's first multi-party elections
at the end of 1992, UNITA refused to take the election results,
accusing the government of fraud, therefore once again took up
arms and started the civil war.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Issue Special Coin for WWF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Cyprus
announced Wednesday that a special coin will be issued to
commemorate the work of the World Wild Fund for Nature (WWF).
</P>
<P>
The limited-edition coin depicts a Green Turtle (Chelonia
Mydas) and will be available from March 23. The coinage was done
at the British mint in England.
</P>
<P>
Three thousand silver coins in presentation boxes will be
available for 12.50 Cyprus pounds (about 25 U.S. dollars) each,
while another 3,000 copper coins will be available for one pound
and eight cents (about 2.16 U.S. dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
The Green Turtle nests its eggs in the Akamas peninsula, at the
westmost part of Cyprus, near the Lara and Toxeftra bay.
</P>
<P>
The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN)
lists the Green Turtle as an endangered species.
</P>
<P>
According to the IUCN, the annual number of Green Turtle
nesting females in the entire Mediterranean could be as low as
325 to 375.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Cyprus, they nest in very few other known
locations. They depend on the beaches of Akamas for their
survival in the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
International and local environmental groups have launched a
series of campaigns, demanding the protection of the area and its
declaration into a National Park, thus providing full protection
for the nesting sites.

NAIROBI, March 11 (Xinhua)- The Rwandan Ministry of Education
has cancelled over 1,000 high school certificates following the
discovery of a series of fraud and irregularities in some
schools.
</P>
<P>
"The Ministry did not dump any certificate," Jean Pierre
Bizimana, Minister of State, told reporters Tuesday night,
reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
It is alleged that some schools failed to abide by the rules
established by the Ministry of Education relating to
deliberations and therefore, accorded certificates to students
who have failed in four or more subjects.
</P>
<P>
This measure also hits those who skipped some years of high
school, or moved to other schools without an official transfer.
</P>
<P>
Most seriously hit are about 400 graduates from Butamwa
Polytechnic School.
</P>
<P>
According to the Minister of State, all the 400 certificates
must be cancelled because the school did not abide by the
Ministry's curricula.
</P>
<P>
This new crisis in offering certificates adds to intricacies
that have characterized the Ministry of Education after the 1994
genocide.
</P>
<P>
It was quite a challenge to harmonize the schooling system in
a country which had then turned into a melting-pot for returnees
from English-speaking east African countries and others from
Francophone countries like Burundi, and former Zaire.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Bizimana told the press that the Rwanda
National University cannot open its doors for 1998-1999 academic
year due to a serious lack of lecturers.
</P>
<P>
Initially planned for March 1, 1998, the opening ceremonies
have been postponed to April.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Vice President-elect Pledges to Push </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's newly elected vice
president B.J. Habibie here Wednesday evening pledged to carry out
industrialization in the country by relying national power on
renewable human resources.
</P>
<P>
The vice president made the statement at his swearing in
ceremony held before the members of the People's Consultative
Assembly (MPR) who were attending the five-yearly general session.
</P>
<P>
Habibie, who has been State Minister of Research and Technology
since 1978, was elected as vice president for 1998-2003 period
earlier Wednesday by the MPR, the highest legislative body.
</P>
<P>
"I am ready to assist and associate with the president in
carrying out state duties and development endeavors of our nation
in the run up to the 21st century, the era of globalization and
technology, to meet the expectation of the whole of the Indonesian
people," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the industrialization is aimed at realizing a modern
and self-reliant national industry, that relies on a strong
agricultural sector and utilizes, develops and masters both
science and technology in order to stimulate an increasing
self-supporting and highly competitive national life.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the MPR Chairman Harmoko, who chaired the conclusion
meeting of general session, said the 11-day session has succeeded
in producing several decisions and decrees including endorsing the
State Policy Guideline for the next five year, electing a
president and a vice president.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 State Policy Guidelines will be carried out earnestly
by the president who shall lead the nation in the run-up to the
21st century in the third millennium, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Harmoko, who is also speaker of the House of Representatives
(parliament), quoted president Soeharto as saying that in the new
century the Indonesian people will face with more difficult and
complex new challenges.
</P>
<P>
On the current economic and monetary crisis which has hit the
country since July last year, he expressed the hope that the
president and vice president will immediately take the steps to
overcome it.
</P>
<P>
"The Assembly strongly believes that the president shall not
hesitate for a moment to take the necessary steps to safe the
people and weather the storms," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Harmoko held that international cooperation and assistance is
important, but it is more important to rely on the nation's
strength and confidence.
</P>
<P>
The MPR, which was attended by 1,000 members from five factions
-- the ruling Golkar party, the Armed Forces, the regional
representatives, the United Development Party (PPP) and the
Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI), -- had reelected the incumbent
president Soeharto to his seventh term of office on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> South Africa to Spend More on Social Services, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 11 (Xinhua) -- South African Finance
Minister Trevor Manuel on Wednesday announced in Cape Town a
budget for 1998/99 in parliament, stressing to increase spending
on social services, police, justice and correctional services.
</P>
<P>
Unveiling the 201-billion Rand (40.2 billion U.S. Dollars)
budget, Manuel said the budgets for police, justice and
correctional services have received a 12 percent increase and
will tatal 20.7 billion Rand (4.1 billion Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Health services will receive 14 percent of the budget (4.6
billion Dollars), education 28 percent (9 billion Dollars), while
spending on housing would remain above 3.5 billion Rand (700
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Capital spending on water schemes and related infrastructure
would be 1.6 billion Rand (320 million Dollars) in 1998/99, and
rise to 1.8 billion Rand (360 million Dollars) in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The allocation to poverty relief projects will rise from 500
million Rand (100 million Dollars) in 1997/98 to 800 million Rand
(160 million Dollars) in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Education spending would grow from 45 billion Rand (nine
billion Dollars) in 1997/98 to more than 50 billion Rand (10
billion Dollars) over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Manuel said the government expected investment growth to
strengthen in the rest of 1998 and further into 1999 and remained
confident that a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of three percent
would be achieved.
</P>
<P>
Last year, South Africa's GDP was registered at 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The South African government's projection was that inflation
would fall to around five percent by the year 2000. The current
inflation rate in South Africa is 5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The new budget showed that tax cuts worth 3.7 billion Rand
(740 million Dollars) for middle income taxpayers, but smokers,
drinkers and motorists will cough up more to help balance the
books.
</P>
<P>
The fuel levy on petrol and diesel would increase by 10 cents
a liter from next month. Excise duties on cigarettes has been
raised by 29 percent and a packet of 20 cigarettes would now cost
46 cents extra. Pipe tobacco will cost an extra 2.11 Rand (40
cents) per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
The South African government would place 3.7 billion Rand back
into the taxpayer's pocket by eliminating some of the effects of
tax bracket creep.
</P>
<P>
This means that a person under the age of 65 and earns 25,000
Rand (5,000 Dollars) per year will pay 300 Rand (60 Dollars) less
tax per year, a 20 percent reduction in liability.
</P>
<P>
Value-Added Tax will remain unchanged at 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
In releasing his first budget under the Medium Term
Expenditure Framework, which allows the government to present
spending plans for the next three years, Manuel also announced
the establishment of a special fund to create jobs.

WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton has

</P>
<P>
This is the first discovery of cholera in the province since
its outbreak last August. So far, six of the country's 10
provinces in the central and southern part have been hit by the
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
Disclosing the news at a press conference, Barreto said the

<HEADLINE> Russian Envoy to Visit Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian envoy Vladimir Tchizhov
will visit Cyprus early April to review the latest development of
the Cyprus issue, a senior Russian diplomat announced here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Interior Minister
Dinos Michaelides, Russian Ambassador to Cyprus Georgi Mouradov
said Tchizhov will visit Cyprus within the framework of Russia's
interest to back efforts to solve the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on threats by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash
that he will not participate in peace talks, Mouradov said his
country favors the continuation of the dialog between the two
communities of Cyprus. "This is the only way to find a fair
solution," he added.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of U.N.-led peace talks between the two Cypriot
communities' leaders were held last summer, which failed because
of Denktash's refusal to negotiate after the European Union
decided to open accession talks with Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Mouradov pointed out that "U.N. Security Council and General
Assembly resolutions should be implemented, as well as the two
high level agreements between the two communities."
</P>
<P>
He described the agreements of 1977 and 1979 reached between
the leaders of the two Cypriot communities, providing for a
bizonal, bicommunal federation, as the basis of a solution in
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Referring to press reports that the U.S. is exerting pressure
on the Cypriot government to postpone the deployment of the
surface-to-air missile system S-300 it ordered from Russia,
Mouradov said the deal is legal in all aspects.
</P>
<P>
He said Cyprus needs this defense system and this is why no
pressure should be exerted and there should be no third party's
involvement in the matter.
</P>
<P>
The Russian-made S-300 missiles were ordered by the Cypriot
government in January 1997 and they are expected to be deployed on
the island later this year.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has threatened to strike the missiles if they are
deployed on the island.
</P>
<P>
This East Mediterranean island has been divided since 1974
when Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern third
of the island following a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> West Countries Criticized for Imposing West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
Wednesday criticized western countries and donor agencies to
force African nations to accept their economic and political
systems.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the African diplomatic corps who paid a courtesy
call to the president here, Moi noted that these systems were
incompatible with individual needs of African countries.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan leader decried that Africa had for a long time been
used for political experiment, most of which had gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
Economic and political systems grown up in Africa are going
away because African nations have been arm-twisted into accepting
irrelevant systems, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Moi stated that African countries ought to present their
individual problems and needs in an honest manner without trying
to please anyone, adding that African problems would have to be
solved by Africans themselves.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, the Dean of the African diplomatic corps,
Clarkson Umelo who is the Nigerian High Commissioner to Kenya,
saluted President Moi for his unrelenting crusade for peace in
East, Central and the Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
He told the president that it was on the account of this and
other initiatives that other African heads of state hold him in
high esteem as a prominent peace broker and elder statesman.

<HEADLINE> EU Proposes Random Road Checks to Enhance Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Heavy truck drivers in European
Union countries may soon expect to be stopped and have their
vehicles checked by roadside as a move to enhance road safety and
air quality.
</P>
<P>
The move, proposed on Wednesday by the European Commission,
requires EU member states to supplement their annual
roadworthiness test on commercial vehicles, heavy goods vehicles
in particular, with random roadside inspections.
</P>
<P>
Commission officials said that recent surveys indicated that
the annual routine inspection on commercial vehicles does not
guarantee an acceptance standard of maintenance throughout the
year.
</P>
<P>
Immediate action is needed, therefore, to improve road safety
as the road haulage market is to become fully liberalized on July
1, this year.
</P>
<P>
Heavy goods vehicles already cause around 20 percent of the
annual deaths of 45,000 people on the roads of the European Union,
according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
Air quality is also needed to improve so as to create the
conditions of fair competition by ensuring that all vehicles are
maintained to similar standards.
</P>
<P>
"This will discourage irresponsible operators from trying to
cut costs by operating vehicles so poorly-maintained that they
threaten the life of other road users and damage the environment,"
said Neil Kinnock, European commissioner in charge of transport
policy.
</P>
<P>
Commission officials argued that for many of the heaviest
vehicles travelling some 150,000 kilometers a year, an annual
inspection is unlikely to provide sufficient guarantee that
commercial vehicles operating on EU territory do so with an
acceptance standard of maintenance throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that two-thirds of the serious defects that
contribute to causes of accidents or fatalities on EU highways
concerned defective brakes resulting from lack of proper
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that a correctly maintained fleet of heavy
goods vehicles saves 2 percent of fuel consumption and an
equivalent proportion of carbon dioxide emissions.

and attended by Defense Minister Yithzak Mordechai and National
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon.
</P>
<P>
The main topic was the Israeli offer to unilaterally withdraw
from South Lebanon in conformity with the U.N. Security Council's
resolution 425 calling for Israeli pullback.
</P>
<P>
The ministers heard the reports presented by senior Army
officials, including Army intelligence chief Moshe Yaalon,
Northern Command head Amiram Levine and Coordinator in South
Lebanon Uri Lubrani.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that the uniform view formed in the
inner Cabinet was that the Israeli pullback would only be
implemented with Syrian agreement following peace negotiations
with Damascus. Israel's whole Cabinet is to discuss the issue at
next week's session.
</P>
<P>
The idea for a unilateral withdrawal was proposed by Netanyahu
following the killing of three Israeli soldiers last Thursday. So
far four Israeli soldiers have been killed by Hezbollah (Party of
God) guerrilla forces in South Lebanon this year.
</P>
<P>
Since Israel's establishment of the so-called South Lebanon
Security Zone in 1985, an average 35 Israeli soldiers were killed
annually, leading to increasing domestic pressure for a
unilateral withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
While Netanyahu pledged to honor the U.N. resolution 425 by
unilaterally withdrawing troops from Lebanon, he demanded for
Lebanese government's promise to take over security control in
the area to ensure the safety of Israeli northern
territory.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria have rejected the idea, saying Israel must
withdraw its troops without setting any conditions.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Europe last week, Netanyahu explored with
European leaders the possibility of deploying international
forces to maintain security in South Lebanon following an Israeli
pullout.
</P>
<P>
But the common sense was that any Israeli withdrawal would not
be feasible without reaching an agreement with Syria, which
Israel charges for using the fighting in Lebanon as a leverage in
talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian talks have been halted since early 1996 and
the hope for its resumption has been slim since the access to
power by the hardline Likud government led by Netanyahu.

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief to Visit Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana is to visit Albania on Thursday following a visit to NATO
headquarters by the country's secretary of state for defense.
</P>
<P>
Solana is expected to meet Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano
and discuss with him the crisis in Kosovo as well as other topics
of common interest, according to a NATO official who demanded not
to be named.
</P>
<P>
Perikli Teta, the Albanian secretary of state for defense, took
part in Wednesday's 16 plus 1 meeting of the North Atlantic
Council with Albania.
</P>
<P>
The meeting discussed the Kosovo issue apart from matters of
the Balkan country's individual Partnership for Peace program.
</P>
<P>
At a post-meeting press briefing, Teta said that the Albanian
people are peace-oriented and have done the utmost to prevent the
current situation from departing for the worst.
</P>
<P>
The secretary of state for defense said that his country has no
single doubt in NATO for finding a peaceful solution to the Kosovo
crisis and that he felt NATO is close with Albania in facing the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the council meeting said that NATO ambassadors
at the meeting advised the Albanian government to exercise
restraint and expressed readiness to help should refugees flood
Albania from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief described Wednesday's meeting with Teta as very
important in that NATO and Albania are to strengthen their
partnership for peace cooperation in order to help secure the
stability of the region.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo is a region in southern Yugoslavia bordering Albania
where Albanian ethnics dwell.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Government Vows to Fight for National </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Higino Carneiro, government
spokesman at the Joint Committee of the Angolan Peace Process,
said here Wednesday that the government is taking all measures to
fight against the activities destabilizing political and military
situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Carneiro, who is also Vice Minister for Territory, said the
government will take firm actions to fight activities
destabilizing national situation to avert the unstabilizing trend
in the country since the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) has declared military
demobilization---a requirement for officially ending civil war in
Angola.
</P>
<P>
This means, he said, that the government will do all it can
for the final peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the government declared, after serious
consideration, the legalization of UNITA after UNITA announced
military demobilization last Friday, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that some remanent UNITA soldiers have been
sabotaging peace and stability in some parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
What Carneiro has said can be seen as a warning against the
saboteurs telling them that the government has decided to crush
them so as to create conditions for ending the peace process
scheduled for March 31.

<HEADLINE> Mass Funeral for 40 Children Held in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A mass funeral was held here
Wednesday for 40 children who have died for lack of medicine and
foodstuffs due to the U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq for its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Saltan al-Shawy, chairman of the Iraqi child support society,
was quoted by the Iraqi news agency as saying that the embargo has
led to the death of 1.3 million Iraqi children.
</P>
<P>
He held the U.S. administration responsible for the death of
the children on account of its determination to maintain the
unjustified sanctions on the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shawy described the continuing embargo as a collective
annihilation crime against the children and people of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He delivered a letter from parents of the deceased to the U.N.
resident representative office in Baghdad. In their letter, the
parents expressed their deep sorrow and strong denunciation of the
collective killing of children throughout the years of embargo.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures compiled by the Iraqi Ministry of
Health, the mortality rate among children in all Iraqi provinces
stands at 7,500 deaths per month, due to the serious shortages of
foodstuffs and medicine.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The campus of the Free Belgian
University (ULB) in Brussels had to be evacuated on Wednesday
morning as the police received an anonymous phone call warning of
bombs.
</P>
<P>
Local police and gendarme were warned just before nine o'clock
that explosives had been planted in the university.
</P>
<P>
A thorough search that followed did not find any explosive
device in the university though the police had to strengthen
patrols at the airport, railway station and major crossroads in
the city.
</P>
<P>
Though no one claimed responsibility for the false bomb alert,
the phone call was feared to have some connection with Islamic
extremism terrorists, according to local television reports.
</P>
<P>
Local television RTBF said that a similar false bomb alert was
rung up in the city two years ago.

<P>
OTTAWA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Canada announced Wednesday a
series of new initiatives in support of its current policy toward
Algeria following a recent parliamentary delegation visit there.
</P>
<P>
The new initiatives include an early visit to Canada by
Algerian parliamentarians and a meeting here of the Canada-Algeria

countries.
</P>
<P>
Canada will also encourage the voluntary sector, especially
those groups that are active in women's and children's issues, to
develop collaboration with their Algerian counterparts.
</P>
<P>
"We have taken steps to equip our embassy in Algiers with
enhanced resources to support this kind of cooperation," said
Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy while making the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
Measures will be considered to encourage the independent
Algerian press, Axworthy said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: U.S. Would Consult UN Before Any Iraq Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Wednesday the United States would consult U.N. Security
Council before any attack on Iraq, but insisted that it did not
need U.N. approval to launch an attack.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the resolution gives us the authority to take
whatever actions are necessary. But of course we would consult,"
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Before a meeting with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
Clinton said, "It would be unthinkable that we wouldn't. We do
that all the time anyway."
</P>
<P>
"So the consultation is an ongoing process and part of the
way we do business in the international community, and I agree
with what the president has said," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Clinton also praised Annan for his work in achieving
the deal with Iraq in resolving the weapons inspection crisis. He
denied the accusation by Senate majority leader Trent Lott that
the deal was a sellout to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement on its own terms preserves the integrity of the
UNSCOM (UN Special Commission) inspections," Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> France Calls on U.N. to Give Iraq Hopes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 11 (Xinhua) -- France on Wednesday called on the
U.N. to give hopes to Iraqi people who are suffering from the
seven-year-old U.N. sanctions if Baghdad really has destroyed its
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by French Ambassador in Lebanon Daniel
Jouanneau, who delivered a letter from French Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine to his Lebanese counterpart Fares Boueiz.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news conference, Jouanneau said "We believe that
the U.N. should give Iraq some hopes and say to its President
Saddam Hussein and its people what will happen if it applies with
the U.N. resolutions and destroy all weapons of mass destruction."
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said the letter also expressed his country's
wishes that the U.N. lift its seven-year-old sanctions imposed on
Iraq due to its 1990 invasion of Kuwait if U.N. arms experts prove
that Iraq doesn't hold any weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, France expressed satisfaction with the
U.N. resolution regarding the Iraq weapons inspection and the
agreement reached between the U.N. general secretary Kofi Annan
and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed last month to defuse a crisis in which
the U.S. and Britain unleased war threat against Iraq to force
Baghdad to open some presidential sites for U.N. weapons
inspectors. It allows U.N. experts free entry to those places.
</P>
<P>
France, together with China and Russia, has opposed the use of
force as well-prepared by the other two permanent members in the
U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
However, France asks Iraq to fully comply with the agreement
with the United Nations, Jouanneau added.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A key committee of the U.S.
House of Representatives recommended on Wednesday Congress reject
a measure that would force President Bill Clinton to pull the U.S.
troops out Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The full House still must debate and vote on the proposal
suggesting the pullout although the House International Relations
Committee voted 22-16 to recommend its disapproval of the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, proposed by Republican Tom Campbell of
California, was intended to be a vehicle to seek a decision by the
U.S. Supreme Court on the president's powers to commit the U.S.
military to involvement in hostilities.
</P>
<P>
"It would be interpreted by friends and foes alike as a sign
that the Congress does not support what our troops are doing in
Bosnia," chairman Benjamin Gilman, Republican of New York, said.
</P>
<P>
In December last year, U.S. President Bill Clinton decided to
maintain an open-ended military presence in Bosnia after twice
missing deadlines for a U.S. withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
At present, the United States has 8,500 troops in Bosnia, and
the number could be reduced to 6,900.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Build Nuclear Power Plant in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Russia is ready to build a nuclear
power plant in Bushehr, Iran, despite Ukraine's refusal to supply
turbine, the Russian Ministry for Atomic Energy said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, Minister for Atomic
Energy Yevgeny Adamov had talks with visiting Vice President of
the Iranian Organization for Nuclear Energy Asadullah Saburi and
they agreed that Ukraine's refusal to participate in the project
"will not exert any serious influence on the construction of the
first unit in Bushehr."
</P>
<P>
Adamov's spokesman Georgy Kaurov cited Adamov as saying that if
Ukraine does not supply the turbine, similar equipment will be
provided by Russian enterprises.
</P>
<P>
A contract worth 800 million U.S. dollars for building the
first unit of the Bushehr nuclear power plant was signed by Russia
and Iran on January 8, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the Russian Ministry for Atomic Energy said the
first unit will be built in three years. The Bushehr nuclear power
plant will have a VVER-1000 water-cooled Russian reactor.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the earlier-adopted plans, the turbine
equipment, estimated at about 40 million U.S. dollars, was to be
supplied by Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
The report said it is not ruled out that in the future Russia
and Iran will reach a new agreement on building two more energy
units for the Bushehr nuclear power plant.
</P>
<P>
Russia's cooperation with Iran in the construction of a nuclear
power plant met with strong opposition from the United States who
blamed Russia for supplying Iran with know-how that can be used
for military purposes, including for the creation of an Islamic
nuclear bomb.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Bulgak Wednesday said
Russia should face no reprimands over cooperation with Iran in the
nuclear energy sphere.
</P>
<P>
One should remember that Iran is a member of the International
Atomic Energy Agency and that Iran has signed the Nonproliferation
Treaty, Bulgak noted. Therefore, there can be no reprimands as far
as cooperation with this country is concerned, he said.

PARIS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
Wednesday met with the Chief Executive of Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) of China, Tung Chee Hwa, who is on a
three-day visit in France.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that he briefed Jospin on the situation in Hong Kong
after its return to Chinese sovereignty eight months ago.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed the impact of the Asian financial crisis on
Hong Kong, as well as ways to prevent such kind of financial
crisis from taking place again in future, said Tung.
</P>
<P>
They also agree that the HKSAR and France will study the
signing of an agreement on visa-free arrangement between Hong Kong
and France.
</P>
<P>
After arriving from Bonn Thursday morning, Tung also met with
the president of the French Senate, Rene Monory, and attended a
dinner hosted by the French National Employers' Association CNPF,
during which he made a speech on the perspective of development in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Tung said that Hong Kong pays great importance
to developing its relations of partnership with France, its 10th
largest trade partner with bilateral trade volume attaining 36.6
billion francs (61 billion U.S. dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Tung will make a visit to the French industrial city of Lyon on
Thursday and will meet with President Jacques Chirac on Friday
before winding up his visit.

<P>
JERUSALEM, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu Wednesday called for keeping calm toward
Tuesday's shooting incident near the West Bank city of Hebron and
avoiding more conflict between Israeli soldiers and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Before his meeting with visiting Albanian Prime Minister Fatos
Nano in the Prime Minister's office here, Netanyahu told reporters
that he hoped "cool heads will prevail" in the current situation.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that Israel wants to calm the tense situation
after the incident, in which three Palestinian workers were killed
by Israeli soldiers at a check point.
</P>
<P>
Following the shooting, clashes erupted between Israeli troops
and local residents around the check point. Confrontations and
demonstrations also broke out in the territories, with young
Palestinians throwing stones at Israeli soldiers, who responded
with tear gas and rubber bullets.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the possibility of a wave of violence against
Israel, Netanyahu said that violence would damage the interests
of both Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks are
beneficial to both sides, and Israel will move on the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to calm the situation, Israeli security forces
remained in close contact with the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) in the wake of the incident. Palestinian police have been
deployed in Hebron to try to keep order.
</P>
<P>
The shooting incident came at a time of deadlock in
Israeli-Palestinian peace process. PNA President Yasser Arafat had
threatened that there would be a new Palestinian intifada
(uprising) in the territories if no breakthrough in the peace
talks is achieved.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Palestinian peace process has been stalled for nearly a
year over the construction of a Jewish settlement in Arab East
Jerusalem in March last year.

<HEADLINE> Russian Duma Calls for Preventing New Sanction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma Wednesday
called on Russian diplomats to prevent the U.N. Security Council
from adopting a decision on new sanctions or use of force against
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, the State Duma in a
draft resolution on the situation with Kosovo adopted Wednesday
said that the conflict in Kosovo can be settled only by peaceful
methods and with unconditional respect for the territorial
integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Duma deputies suggested that the Russian leadership "raise
the issue of inadmissibility of interference of neighboring
countries in the internal conflict in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
The Duma wants the international community "to take resolute
measures for halting arms supplies to extremist groups in Kosovo".
</P>
<P>
The draft reads that "the foundation of a settlement in Kosovo
is the territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
and respect for the legitimate rights of the Albanian population
and other residents of the territory in line with generally
accepted standards of international law."
</P>
<P>
At the same day the Duma also passed unanimously a resolution
to send a delegation to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky Tuesday
stated that Russia opposed the idea of introducing economic
sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the U.N. Security Council is to consider
imposing an embargo on arms supplies "both to the Yugoslav Federal
Republic and to Kosovo and Kosovo terrorists".

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Killer Nurse Sentenced to Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 11 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian court Wednesday
sentenced to death a nurse after finding her guilty of murdering a
patient and attempting to kill 29 others by injecting lethal
doses, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Alexandria Criminal Court ordered that the sentence be
referred to the Mufti, Egypt's chief Muslim official, for
ratification before reaffirming it on March 26.
</P>
<P>
Aida Nourreddine, a 25-year-old nurse at Al Meeri Hospital of
northern port city Alexandria, was arrested last August after the
recurring deaths of 33 intensive care patients from respiratory
failure shortly after they had undergone successful surgeries.
</P>
<P>
Investigations show that she injected them with a respiratory
muscle relaxant which caused them choke to death in the state-run
hospital in the country's second largest city.
</P>
<P>
Nourreddine was suspected of having been involved in all the 33
deaths but was charged with murdering only one patient as an
autopsy could be conducted only on him. She was also accused of
attempted murder of 29 other persons who survived.
</P>
<P>
But the former "model nurse" of her hospital, who works at the
neurology department's intensive care unit (ICU), pleaded
innocent. She also accused doctors at the department of negligence
and prescribing the wrong medication to their patients.
</P>
<P>
She reportedly sought revenge on her ex-lover, a doctor in the
same hospital who jilted her, by killing patients under his care.
</P>
<P>
The police have found a surprise twist in their investigation
as they can have no access to the ICU patients' dossiers, with
hospital officials claiming that they had been disposed of. The
standard practice is to delete such files five years after being
closed.

He was careful to speak only of consulting with the Security
Council rather than seeking its approval.
</P>
<P>
Clinton praised Annan for his diplomacy, which reduced for the
moment the threat of a U.S.-British military strike against Iraq.
On Feb. 23, Annan succeeded in reaching an accord with Baghdad to
revive weapons inspections under the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"Let me (say) how pleased I am with the agreement worked out
with Iraq to continue the inspections as well as the access which
has been provided to the inspectors," Clinton said. "The
secretary-general deserves a lot of appreciation from the United
States and all Americans for the work that is being done."
</P>
<P>
Annan's two-day visit, his first to Washington since returning
from Iraq, is designed to build political support for his
agreement with Iraq on weapons inspections and to appeal once more
for the United States to pay the 1.3 billion dollars in arrears to
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Annan told reporters on his plane to Washington that he
expected the U.S. Congress to make good on an agreement struck
last year under which the arrears would be made in return for
reforms Annan carried out to slim down the world body's
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
He said a lot had changed at the United Nations in the last 15
months. "We have delivered and I want to know when they will
deliver," he said.
</P>
<P>
As he was flying from New York, House of Representatives
Republicans announced they would link anti-abortion provisions to
any legislation covering the U.N. funding.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he regretted the addition of abortion provisions,
saying it was made "for purely domestic reasons." But he said it
was something that had to be worked out between Clinton and
Congress.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Chief Executive Confides in Basic Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, the Chief Executive
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of China,
said here on Wednesday that the Basic Law of Hong Kong is "the
ultimate source of our confidence."
</P>
<P>
"The Basic Law provides a constitutional framework for the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region. It institutionalizes the
concept of `one country, two systems.' It clearly prescribes that
the social, economic and political system in Hong Kong will be
different from those in mainland China. It protects the rights,
freedoms and lifestyle of Hong Kong people," said Tung in a speech
to the French National Employers' Association CNPF.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the Basic Law guarantees the independence of
Hong Kong's judiciary, allows complete financial autonomy,
establishes Hong Kong as a separate customs territory and gives
Hong Kong full responsibility to manage its own affairs -- except
foreign affairs and defense.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that it is in the fundamental national interests of
China that the "one country, two systems" be implemented,
because by demonstrating that different social, economic and
political systems can operate within one country will be a
significant step towards the greater and final objective of the
unification of the entire nation.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Basic Law has set out a 10-year
timetable for elections both for the Chief Executive and for the
Legislature, which will increase the number of members of
Legislature to be directly elected to 50 percent in three phases
from 1998 to 2004.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, the process of democratic evolution in the next
decade will be far more comprehensive and far-reaching than what
we had under 156 years of colonialism," he said.

<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior Party official today
called for better protection of the legitimate rights and
interests of deputies to people's congresses at all levels,
China's legislative bodies.
</P>
<P>
At a full meeting of deputies from south China's Guangdong
Province to the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), China's
top legislature, in session here since last Thursday, Deputy Li
Changchun said that deputies to people's congresses at all levels
are serving as a powerful supervisory force.
</P>
<P>
"Standing committees of people's congresses at all levels
should take effective measures to protect the deputies' legitimate
rights and interests, to enable them to perform their duties
boldly," said Li, a member of the Political Bureau of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and also
newly-appointed secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of
the CPC.
</P>
<P>
He said that there are 150,000 deputies to the people's
congresses at all levels in Guangdong alone, who can play the role
of "a bridge" between the Party and government departments and the
general public.
</P>
<P>
"We should open channels for these deputies so as to directly
put forth complaints or suggestions to principal leading officials
of local Party committees and to guarantee that they get a prompt
and satisfactory answer," he urged.

<HEADLINE> Four Japanese Opposition Parties Agree to Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Four Japanese opposition parties
comprising the largest parliamentary opposition group, Minyuren,
on Thursday agreed to form a new party ahead of the House of
Councillors (upper house) election in July, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The four parties -- the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), The
Good Governance Party (GGP), the Amity Party and the Democratic
Reform Party (DRP) -- agreed to merge under the DPJ banner during
the group's high-level strategy session.
</P>
<P>
The parties plan to launch a task force next week to prepare
for their merger and discuss principles and policies to be adopted
by the new party, which is expected to be formed before the
"Golden Week" holidays which will run between April 29 and May 5.
</P>
<P>
The new party aims to prevent the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party (LDP) from winning a majority in the upper house in the July
election and to take over power from the LDP at the next House of
Representatives (lower house) election, which is due to take place
by October 2000.
</P>
<P>
The merger will give the new DPJ a total of around 140 seats in
both houses of the Diet (parliament), compared with 380 Diet
members of the LDP.
</P>
<P>
The merger accord was reached in response to a proposal made
last week by former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, a top GGP
member.
</P>
<P>
The parties are now expected to play tug-of-war over who will
represent the new party as its prime ministerial candidate.
</P>
<P>
The DPJ is led by former Health and Welfare Minister Naoto Kan,
while the GGP is headed by former Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, the
Amity Party, by Kansei Nakano, and the DRP, by Teiko Sasano.

<HEADLINE> Russia Draws Up Employment Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government Thursday
approved a federal employment program to run from 1998 to 2000 to
cut unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency quoted Minister for Labor and Social
Development Marina Moskvina as saying the program is expected to
keep unemployment at 3.6 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The program envisions consulting services for about 25 million
people on potential jobs and benefit payments to about 10 million
unemployed.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the program will be financed from the State
Employment Fund and from the federal budget. In 1998, the State
Employment Fund is to allocate about one billion Russian rubles
(160 million U.S. dollars) to this program.

<HEADLINE> German Lobby Claims Cheating on Euro Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Germany failed to meet the single
currency criteria with its 1997 budget deficit at five percent of
the gross domestic product (GDP), a taxpayer lobby alleged
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Theo Waigel had claimed the deficit was 2.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
"It is fatal and highly alarming that even Germany used various
tricks concerning the convergence criteria," said Karl Heinz
Daeke, leader of the Association of Taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
Under European Monetary Union criteria, countries must limit
their budget deficit to under three percent of the GDP to be
qualified as a euro country, the single European currency to be
launched on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Daeke told reporters Bonn used a series of unorthodox measures
to get the 2.7 percent figure -- delaying payments, collecting
future revenues in advance and shifting loss-making economic
activities to the private sector in order to conceal deficits.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized Italy and France for using tricks to bring
down budget deficit figures.
</P>
<P>
His organization called for a delayed startup of the euro, but
admitted this was unlikely to happen.
</P>
<P>
European leaders had a "blind determination" to go ahead with
the single currency, he said.
</P>
<P>
Only the German Constitutional Court was still able to prevent
Germany from joining the euro next year, Daeke added.

center in north China in line with directives of the central

<HEADLINE> Stability Returns to Xinjiang After Crackdown on Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The crackdown on terrorist
activities in northwest Xinjian autonomous region has resulted in
an improved public security situation there, according to a senior
official of the Xinjiang regional government.
</P>
<P>
"The move has been successful...Xinjiang is enjoying political
and social stability, and people are living happily and with
contentment," said Wang Lequan, secretary of Xinjiang Regional
Committee of the Communist Party of China at a press conference
hosted here today by the ongoing session of the Ninth National
People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, the crackdown was launched in the region
after the eruption early last year of a series of violent
terrorist activities including robbery, killing with guns and
bus-bombing.
</P>
<P>
Such terrorist activities were perpetuated by a handful of bad
people who want to split China, sow dissension among various
ethnic groups and sabotage relations between the government and
people, Wang noted.
</P>
<P>
One of the measures taken by the regional government is to
educate people in patriotism while exposing the true nature of the
separatists, said Wang. "We also encourage people to expose bad
people and criminal activities," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Now most cases of terrorism have been cracked, with
criminals arrested and given due punishment according to law,"
Wang said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Moscow is not ready to receive
Latvian Foreign Minister Valdis Birkavs, who is hoping to visit
Russia, Russian Foreign Ministry stated on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minsitry's spokesman Gennady Tarasov told a briefing
here that "A visit by the Latvian foreign minister to Moscow as it
was planned by the Latvian side is hardly likely to introduce
something new to our relations."
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, Latvia recently notified Moscow
that Birkavs would like to visit Russia in order to discuss
important issues pertaining to relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Tarasov noted the purpose of the visit by the Latvian Foreign
Minister was to provide explanations over the recent rally of
Russian-speakers in Riga which resulted in police beating elderly
people and women, and to consider the outlook for economic
cooperation between Russian and Latvia.
</P>
<P>
Describing the agenda of the visit as sidestepping the main
cause of the current state of affairs in the bilateral relations,
the spokesman pointed out that the main cause is "disrespect for
the rights of our compatriots living in this country".
</P>
<P>
Russia is looking forward "not to just talking and promises
which was often the case in the past but to practical deeds to
ensure the basic rights and freedoms in Latvia."
</P>
<P>
He continued that if the Latvian side is ready to hold such
talks, Russia is ready for it.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Birkavs said that he is ready and willing to visit
Moscow in the nearest future to meet Russian counterpart Yevgeny
Primakov and other Russian officials to discuss the two countries'
relations.

</P>
<P>
Up to now, a total of 31 members of the Ninth CPPCC National

that nearly 50 Party and state leaders and heads of ministries and
commissions under the State Council attended the three speech
meetings to hear advices from the CPPCC members.
</P>
<P>
A major topic for today's speakers is promoting China's

<HEADLINE> Italy, Albania to Sign Customs Assistance Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Italy and Albania are to sign a
customs assistance agreement as part of a European Union
assistance program to Albania, the European Commission said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mario Monti, Italian commissioner for customs affairs, signed a
declaration Thursday in Tirana, Albania, marking the conclusion of
the agreement between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Italy would provide two patrol vessels to
assist Albania's customs administration in its monitoring and
supervision of commercial maritime traffic and in the prevention
of smuggling.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
union, will grant the accord 225,000 ECUs (240,750 dollars) under
the framework of its memorandum of understanding on the customs
assistance to Albania, which was signed last November.
</P>
<P>
A European customs assistance mission was set up in Tirana last
June. It was part of the commission's response to a request for
support from the Albanian government to the international
community following unrest in the country in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
The mission will continue until the end of this year to assist
the Albanian customs authorities in ensuring the collection of
customs duties and in intercepting smuggling.

<P>
Noting that he once visited the Middle East region, and has
been to Egypt, Israel, Syria, and Palestine, Qian said he went
there only for the purpose of acquainting himself with the
situation there and setting forth some of China's views on the
Middle East issue.
</P>
<P>
China will not be a mediator or go-between on the Middle East
question, he said, adding that the settlement of middle-east issue
should be listed on the agenda after the Iraqi Weapon Inspection
crisis is initially settled, so as to continue advancing the
middle-east peaceful process.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that all parties concerned are able to continue
advancing the peaceful process, the Chinese vice-premier said.
</P>
<P>
In response to questions on Hong Kong, Qian said he has every
confidence in the up-coming election of the Legislative Council in
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) in May, which
will surely be just, fair and open.
</P>
<P>
He said the coming May will see the election for the first
legislative council in Hong Kong. The methods, the work of
organizing and all essential preparations are all devised,
organized and conducted by the Hong Kong SAR government, and the
central government does not plan to send any people there to
monitor the election.
</P>
<P>
The deputies to the NPC and members of the CPPCC National
Committee from the HKSAR have come to Beijing, which demonstrates
that the representatives from the HKSAR are also in the position
to participate in the discussions and administration of the state
affairs of the whole of China, he noted, adding they have not come
to Beijing for the purpose of discussing affairs concerning the
Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
With regard to individual remarks, everybody has his freedom
for what he likes to say, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Turning to Macao issue, he said the Preparatory Committee of
the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) will be established
very soon.
</P>
<P>
"The date of Macao's return to the motherland is drawing
increasingly nearer, and all kinds of related preparatory work is
proceeding smoothly. The Preparatory Committee of the Macao SAR
will be established, and this is a matter that falls within the
scope of the authority of the NPC, he said.

Taking questions on Taiwan, he said conditions are ripe to hold
cross-Straits political negotiations under the principle of "one
China".
</P>
<P>
He underlined that negotiations should be held in accordance
with the principle of "one China". In this way can Taiwan
compatriots' desire to seek peace and security be satisfied, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Qian said a step-by-step approach can be adopted before further
talks are held, and the first step is to end hostilities across
the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
It is reasonable to hold procedural talks to discuss the name,
form and ways of negotiations, and all kinds of matters can be
discussed.
</P>
<P>
According to the previous experience, there were political
obstacles when business talks were held, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian said he welcomes the expansion of cross-Straits exchanges,
including exchanges between the Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) and Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF).
</P>
<P>
"Recently, the Taiwan side made ambiguous the one-China
principle issue, a question used to be very distinct," he said,
" and I do not understand why Taiwan is afraid of taling about
'one-China' principle."
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan authorities used to adhere to "one China" but now
they have backed down from that position, he added.
</P>
<P>
It is totally unnecessary to be afraid of talking about "one
China," he said. Both sides should recognize that there is one
China in the world before the reunification, that Taiwan is part
of China, and that China's territory and sovereignty cannot be
separated, he said.
</P>
<P>
On Taiwan's role in the Asian financial crisis, he said,
Taiwan's activities during the Southeast Asian financial crisis
will produce no good results.
</P>
<P>
He further noted that the financial crisis started from
Southeast Asia last July and later spread to many countries.
</P>
<P>
Last October, he recalled, Taiwan announced all of sudden the
devaluation of the New Taiwan Dollar by 10 percent, thus leading
to another round of devaluation. Actually, Taiwan added fuel to
the flame of the southeast Asian financial crisis, Qian said.

<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government intends to
sign the International Covenant on Civil And Political Rights,
Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here this
morning.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the remark at a press conference sponsored by the
ongoing First Session of the Ninth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has always attached great importance to
international covenants on human rights and has so far signed 17
such conventions, Qian said, noting that China signed the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
last October.
</P>
<P>
In response to a reporter's question concerning China's role in
pursuing a peaceful settlement of the recent Iraqi weapons
inspection crisis, he said, China has played a due, unique and
positive role in the peaceful settlement of the UN weapons
inspection crisis in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On this issue, he said, "China does not act as a mediator nor
does it put forward any scheme for the settlement," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It adheres to two principles: one is that the relevant UN
Security Council resolutions on the issue must be implemented
earnestly and comprehensively; the other is that China does not
favor the use of force," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian acknowledged that China has persistently made these two
points clear on various occasions, including multilateral
debates, bilateral consultations, exchange of letters among
leaders, telephone conversations and mutual transmission of
information.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, China focused its attention on making the five
permanent members of the UN Security Council unanimously agree and
support Kofi Annan, UN secretary-general, in going to Iraq for
negotiations, which was eventually successful.
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, China has played a positive role," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
On the Middles East issue, he stressed, it is beyond any doubt
that China is prepared to play certain roles in promoting the
peaceful process in the Middle East, but that it is not a party to
be directly involved in the Middle East question, or a direct
party to help resolve the Palestine-Israeli dispute.

Speaking on Sino-Russian relations, he expected that President
Jiang Zemin's planned visit to Russia this year will further
promote the relations between the two neighboring nations.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin will meet with President Yeltsin again in
Russia this year according to a plan agreed upon by the two sides,
although it may not be an official visit, he said.
</P>
<P>
The planned summit between the leaders of the two countries
will help further advance the growth of bilateral relations, Qian
noted.
</P>
<P>
With the settlement of some outstanding issues exiting between
them, he said, the two countries are in a better position to
further bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Concerning Sino-Japanese relations, he said the exchange of
visits by Chinese Premier and Japanese Prime Minister last year
has further promoted the development of Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the two sides conferred on issues of shared
interest and increased mutual understanding, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin is to visit Japan this year as a
return visit for the Japanese Emperor's China trip. It will be the
first visit to Japan by a Chinese president in history, he said.
</P>
<P>
"China and Japan are two major neighboring countries. In
history, the two countries had built long-standing friendship in
addition to close cultural links. However, the two nations also
experienced some unfortunate period in modern history," the
foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the two countries should work together and take
history as a guidance for the future development of Sino-Japanese
relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Sino-British relations, he said, with the settlement of the
Hong Kong issue and scheduled exchange of visits by senior
government leaders, Sino-British relations will witness greater
development in 1998.

"Hong Kong used to be a problem between China and Britain left
over by history. The two countries once fought war over Hong Kong,
and also had conflicts and disputes over the Hong Kong issue,"
noted Qian.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, this 150-year-plus history has already become
by-gones with Hong Kong's return to its motherland, which was
recognized by the British government.
</P>
<P>
"With the settlement of this issue left over from the past, the
relations between China and Britain, two major powers, will surely
enjoy greater growth in all areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
He further noted that British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook has
already paid a visit to China, and British Prime Minister Tony
Blair is also going to visit China later this year. Sino-British
relations will witness a great development in 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, the Chinese premier will attend the second
Asia-Europe Meeting scheduled to be held in London in April, and
also visit Britain.
</P>
<P>
"So I believe this year will witness greater development in
Sino-British relations," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question concerning the Republic of Korea
(ROK), he said China appreciates President Kim Dae-jung's position
on resuming the implementation of the agreement reached between
the North and South of Korea, and his pursuit of a peace policy.
</P>
<P>
Qian also congratulated Kim Dae-jung on his election and
welcomed him to visit China at his convenience.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Kosovo issue, he said China is very concerned
about the recent bloodshed in Kosovo and that arms embargo may be
an option for resolving the issue.
</P>
<P>
"There are really too many weapons in that region," he said,
adding that when the turmoil erupted not long ago in Albania,
there was a very widespread dissemination of weapons in this
region, and almost everybody had a weapon, which was very
dangerous.

The European Union is already prepared to impose an arms
embargo on this region, and the United Nations has not yet
discussed it.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that maybe the United Nations is not an appropriate
place for the discussion of this matter, because you can imagine
if arms embargo is only imposed on Yugoslavia, which may not be
able to resolve this matter totally," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We must consider a more appropriate way, and at least this
matter should be resolved through peaceful means, not through
bloodshed," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo question is fundamentally within Yugoslavia,
therefore it is an internal matter of Yugoslavia, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Kosovo is a part of Yugoslavia's territory, and the
Yugoslavian and Serbian governments have the responsibility and
they should be able to handle and deal with this matter
appropriately," he said.
</P>
<P>
Citing the Balkan region a place with very complex relations
among the various ethnic groups in the region, Qian said the
legitimate rights and interests of all the ethnic groups should be
protected.
</P>
<P>
However, the foreign minister called for efforts to be made to
prevent and guard against splittist activities conducted by some
extremists.
</P>
<P>
"If no caution is paid in this regard, then it may give
rise to extensive regional turmoils or even conflicts," Qian
warned.
</P>
<P>
Any measure to be taken by the international community in
dealing with this situation, he said, should be both conducive to
regional peace and stability and refraining from interfering in
the internal affairs of the countries concerned.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that international community should take measures
to safeguard the peace and stability in the region while guarding
against the interference in the internal affairs of the countries
in the region, Qian Qichen said.

<HEADLINE> Arrested S. African Official's Trip Unauthorized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Senior South African
foreign affairs official Robert Mcbride, who was arrested Monday
in Mozambique for alleged illegal gun running, was at that time
using his diplomatic passport on an unauthorized private visit.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by the Foreign Affairs Department of South
Africa in a statement in Pretoria on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It said that Mcbride, who was arrested Monday in the small
town of Ressano Garcia near the border between South Africa and
Mozambique, was on leave at the time. He is staying in police
custody in Maputo, capital of Mozambique and the Mozambican
police are investigating the matter.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo was shocked at the news of the
arrest, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Director-General Abdul Minty visited Maputo on
Wednesday to investigate the matter and reported to Nzo Wednesday
night, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The legal process in Mozambique will take its normal course,
during which the South African government will maintain regular
contact with the Mozambican government, it said.
</P>
<P>
The news of the arrest has drawn sharp reaction from
opposition parties. They said the incident suggested that the ANC
was using the Foreign Affairs Department as a cover for arms
smuggling.
</P>
<P>
They also accused the government of trying to cover up the
reasons for the arrest and called for Mcbride's suspension
pending the outcome of investigations.
</P>
<P>
No charges has been laid against Mcbride, who is the director
in charge of the Asian desk in the South African Foreign Affairs
Department.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China Reports New Progress in Enterprise Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Provincial governors from three
northeast China provinces, a major industrial base, reported today
remarkable progress in reform of their large state-owned economic
sector.
</P>
<P>
The governors from the provinces of Liaoning, Jilin,
Heilongjiang, present at the current session of the National
People's Congress (NPC), in session since last week, said the past
couple of years have seen the establishment of a number of
industrial conglomerates consisting of firms from different areas,
different industrial sectors and of different ownerships.
</P>
<P>
The large enterprise groups linked by capital have been playing
a key role in boosting economic growth in their respective areas,
said the governors, Zhang Guoguang from Liaoning, Wang Yunkun from
Jilin and Tian Fengshan from Heilongjiang.
</P>
<P>
In Jilin, ten such groups have been set up and they are led by
the First Automotive Works and Jilin Chemical Industry Complex,
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
In Liaoning last year, 49 large and medium-sized firms were
merged and 26 others went bankrupt, and dozens of state-owned
enterprises have been converted into joint-stock companies, the
province's governor said. Reform has been in full swing in more
than 80 percent of all small firms in the province, he said.
</P>
<P>
In Heilongjiang, where state-owned enterprises dominate the
local economy, reforms have centered on the establishment of a
modern enterprise system, according the provincial governor.

<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- "Fundamental changes" have taken
place in northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region since it
was founded in 1958, acting chairman of the regional government Ma
Qizhi said today.
</P>
<P>
Four decades ago, 70 percent of people in Ningxia, an area with
the largest concentration of Hui people in China, did not have
adequate food and clothing. The annual per capita net income of
local residents was less than 100 yuan then, said Ma, who is
attending the annual session of the Ninth National People's
Congress here as a deputy.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the region's economy has been growing at an
average rate of 8.9 percent a year. Per capita grain production
there stands at 500 kg a year, fifth in China. Also, Ningxia ranks
second in the country in per capita amount of electricity
generated, he said.
</P>
<P>
Its gross domestic product soared to 21 billion yuan in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of industry in its economy has risen from 7.8
percent in the late 1950s to 34 percent at present.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia has built economic and trade ties with more than 60
countries and regions. Its import and export value came to 300
million U.S. dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
The annual net income of farmers averaged 1,545 yuan while that
of urban residents 3,431 yuan last year.

<HEADLINE> New Commander of Iran's Mobilization Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei appointed Mohammad Husseinzadeh Hejazi as commander
of the Basij (Mobilization) Resistance Forces on Thursday, the
Iranian official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei, also Commander-in-Chief of the Iranian Armed Forces,
made the decision according to a proposal of the commander of the
Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Yahya Rahim-Safavi and
"by taking into account Hejazi's valuable records and experiences
during his service at the IRGC and Basij forces," the IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
In his decree, Khamenei expressed the hope that Hejazi would
make use of the potential to form a 20-million-strong Basij force,
organize an active and skilled force and promulgate Basij culture
based on the faith and sacrifices of its members.
</P>
<P>
He also lauded the services of the previous commander of the
Basij forces Alireza Afshar during his term of office.
</P>
<P>
The Basij forces, a military reserve in charge of Iran's
internal security under the command of the IRGC, were formed in
the early 1980s during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war according to an
order of the late Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini.

<HEADLINE> Half of Athenians Exposed to Excessive Noise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Despite measures to curb noise,
more than half of all Athenians were exposed to excessive noise
pollution, a newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper, "Athens News", quoted a Greek Environment
Ministry report as saying that 36 percent of the residents in the
Greek capital were subjected to noise whose levels in excess of 75
decibels.
</P>
<P>
During peak hours, the noise in many places in Athens reached
levels of 90 to 100 decibels.
</P>
<P>
The Greek environment ministry sets 66 to 68 as an acceptable
range while the European Union has set a limit of 75 decibels for
vehicle noise emissions.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed much of the noise pollution to Athens'
chronic traffic problem and construction works for the metro.
</P>
<P>
Athens, with a population of four million people, has about 1.3
million cars and 600,000 motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
To cut down on noise, the Greek government has taken measures
including the introduction of a compulsory decibel limit test for
industries and nightclubs, and hefty fines for noisy motorcycle
owners.
</P>
<P>
Greece also began constructing noise barriers two years ago in
spots beside roads and railway lines around Athens.

<HEADLINE> France Warns Schroder Not to Deviate from Coupling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- French Minister-delegate for
European Affairs Pierre Moscovici Thursday warned the German
Socialist candidate for chancellery, Gerhard Schroder, that a
Franco-German axis in the European structure must be maintained.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the "L'Expresse" weekly, published
Thursday, Moscovici said the "European anchorage" by Germany and
its privileged relations with France were an obligation for all
German leaders in the future.
</P>
<P>
Schroder, who was re-elected the president-minister in
Germany's economically powerful Lower Saxony last month, and whose
support rate is much higher than Chancellor Helmut Kohl's, has
said he will organize a round-table debate on the euro and will
transform the Franco-German axis in Europe into a
German-British-French triangle.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that if tomorrow Mr. Schroder becomes chancellor, he
would be as European and as committed to the Franco-German couple
as Mr. Kohl is," said Moscovici.
</P>
<P>
"This reality, because it is necessary for Europe, is an
obligation for all governments, in France as well as in Germany,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed doubt over whether Schroder understands European
problems and France as well as Kohl.
</P>
<P>
"It is true that Gerhard Schroder has not expressed, until now,
with the same strength as Helmut Kohl on the European problems.
Without doubt, he knows less about France than other leaders,"
said Moscovici.

<HEADLINE> Nepal, Bangladesh to Share Experience in Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Nepal hopes to share Bangladesh's
experience in poverty alleviation and infrastructure development,
visiting Nepalese Minister for Local Development Gajendra Marayan
Singh said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to learning from and sharing your (Bangladesh)
experiences," the Nepalese minister said at a three-day workshop
aimed at sharing experiences on food-assisted development in the
two South Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
The Nepalese minister, who arrived here Wednesday, is leading a
30-member delegation to familiarize with the food-assisted
development programs in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Both Nepal and Bangladesh, as members of the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation, face similar challenges,
with getting the people out of poverty and destitution as one of
the major goals, he said.
</P>
<P>
The food-for-work program assisted by the World Food Program
(WFP) has contributed a lot to this direction in Nepal, according
to the Nepalese minister. "We are very happy to learn that WFP
programs have a grand success in Bangladesh," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya, state minister for Local
Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives, said Bangladesh
attaches top priority to poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
Since 1974, the WFP has opened up a new dimension in rural
infrastructure development in Bangladesh through two projects --
Vulnerable Group Development and Rural Development, which are
aimed at poverty alleviation and have created job opportunities
for the poorest, particularly for destitute women, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Federation Council (the
upper house of parliament) approved the 1998 federal budget by a
vote of 115 to 22 against, with four abstentions, on Thursday, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The budget, which was passed by the State Duma (the lower house
of parliament) in its fourth reading on March 4, will be submitted
to President Boris Yeltsin for signing into law.
</P>
<P>
The approved budget provides a deficit of 133 billion rubles
(22 billion U.S. dollars) and an expenditure of about 500 billion
rubles (83 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Revenue is expected to be 367 billion rubles (61 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The GDP is forecast to be 2,840 billion rubles (47 billion
dollars), 90 billion rubles (15 billion dollars) more than earlier
forecast by the government.
</P>
<P>
Annual inflation is estimated to be 5.7 percent, with the
average ruble exchange rate at 6.18 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the budget to the Federation Council, Finance
Minister Mikhail Zadornov said a two percent growth of GDP is the

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputies Expect Better Public Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Deputies to the Ninth National
People's Congress expressed the hope that the government and law
enforcement departments would make greater efforts to improve
public security.
</P>
<P>
Surveys conducted by the State Planning Commission and the
Beijing-based Horizon Market Survey and Analysis Company show that
public security ranked lower last year in the list of popular
concerns in the country.
</P>
<P>
The NPC deputies attributed the markdown to severe crackdowns
on criminal offenses over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
"I feel that the public security situation has stabilized on
the whole and that the social order is good," said Zhang Liangji,
director of the Beijing Public Security Bureau. "The government
has made marked achievement in this regard."
</P>
<P>
However, Premier Li Peng noted in his Government Work Report
that people are not satisfied with the public security situation.
And a report of the Ministry of Public Security says that, despite
a decreasing number of crimes in many places, public security
problems have remained serious.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Liangji said that increases in the number of migrant
workers and in the number of laid-off workers have brought
pressures on public security work. He maintained that public
security departments alone cannot solve all problems.
</P>
<P>
"Correct guidance and increased job opportunities for people
can play a good role," he said.
</P>
<P>
Public security remains a heated topic among the NPC deputies.
NPC deputy Li Wenhai said that good public security will provide a
favorable environment for economic growth and win trust from
people for the government.
</P>
<P>
People have a strong hope that the government would strengthen
the armed police and public security departments so as to crack
down on arrogant criminal offenders, said NPC deputy Chen Xianzhi,
an armed policeman from Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
NPC deputy Jia Qinglin, mayor of Beijing, said that the capital
will continue to crack down on criminal offenses this year.
</P>
<P>
NPC deputy Meng Zhiyuan said that all people should be educated
so that they will become better law-abiding citizens.

ATHENS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Two bombs exploded early Thursday
morning in the Greek capital, Athens, causing extensive damage to
two car showrooms in the suburbs of Ellinorosson and Holargos,

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputies on Improving Social Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Deputies to the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC), in session here since last week, call for
reforming China's social security system, which they say lags far
behind economic reform.
</P>
<P>
Effective measures should be taken to quicken the reform of
old-age, medical and unemployment insurance systems to eliminate
such malpractices as irrational charges and a low rate of
socialization, they say.
</P>
<P>
Dong Wande, chairman of the Liaoning Provincial Federation of
Trade Unions, says the government decision to set up a Ministry of
Labor and Social Security has a great bearing on building a social
security system with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jiren, deputy director of the Shanxi Provincial Department
of Coal Industry, says that the country should expand unemployment
insurance and combine it with employment, create more job
opportunities for laid-off workers and establish a welfare system
guaranteeing a basic living standard for the needy in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Shen Anbo, director of the Yunnan Provincial Policy Research
Center, says that the key to building a social security system is
to accumulate adequate funds. Funds should be raised from a
variety of channels, he says.
</P>
<P>
He advocates a fund-raising system involving contributions from
the state, enterprises and individuals.
</P>
<P>
"This method should be standardized by enacting relevant laws,"
he says.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Troops to Remain in Gulf: Top Officer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States' top military
officer said here Thursday that U.S. troops will remain in the
Gulf region until Iraq complies with United Nations arms
inspections.
</P>
<P>
"We will have a continuous presence in the area. U.S. forces
are in the Gulf to work for implementing the Baghdad deal and to
secure the Iraqi side's abidance by the U.N. resolutions," said
Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Henry Shelton.
</P>
<P>
But if the U.S. is convinced that Iraq complies with the
U.N. resolutions, some 36,000 American troops in the Gulf will be
downsized, Shelton told reporters after talks with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak earlier Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that "the diplomatic solution to the Iraq crisis was
reached through military support."
</P>
<P>
Iraq's refusal last month to allow the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) to inspect presidential sites prompted the U.S. to
unleash a threat to take military actions against it. An agreement
reached between the U.N. and Iraq on February 23 defused the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Iraq will grant free and unconditional
access to eight presidential sites suspected of hiding weapons of
mass destruction to a special team comprising UNSCOM inspectors
and senior diplomats appointed by U.N. chief Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Shelton said that Washington and Cairo have formed "relations
of strategic partnership" that is based on "cooperation, respect
and solidarity."

<HEADLINE> Iran Decides to Privatize State-owned Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 12 (Xinhua) - The Iranian government announced
Wednesday night to transfer the state-owned companies to the
private and cooperative sector in order to save them from serious
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official news agency IRNA Thursday quoted
government spokesman Ataollah Mohajerani as saying that the
cabinet session on Wednesday night announced readiness to ease
the government's control over state-own companies.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani, also Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance,
said that the Plan and Budget Organization briefed the cabinet
session on the status of the state-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
The government is trying to transfer the state-owned companies
to people in a way that the transfers would be in line with
social justice and would not damage their management, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani put the total number of state-run companies at
2,400, saying that 400 of them are "important" firms and only 30
out of the 400 "important" companies, engaged in different areas
of oil, petrochemicals, steel and energy, have key role among
other state-run companies.
</P>
<P>
However, the government has not decided how to transfer the
state-own companies to the people, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, the country's state-owned
companies were facing a serious crisis and some of them were in a
condition of bankruptcy due to liquidity shortages, lack of
investment security, instability in regulations.
</P>
<P>
In many fields, such as the textile industry, the operation
was only around 45 percent of their full capacity. Reports said
that some managing directors had urged President Khatami to save
the companies from being closed down.

WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. Newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- A mile-wide asteroid first detected in December is virtually
certain to sweep past Earth within the distance of the moon 30
years from now, and there's a small chance it could strike Earth
directly with potentially disastrous effects.
</P>
<P>
-- The House passed a broad trade liberalization bill for
Africa Wednesday in what supporters hailed as an acknowledgment
that the impoverished nations of the sub-Sahara region are ready
to take "the playing field of international trade."
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Clinton Administration has decided to move up President
Clinton's trip to Beijing to late June, from November, in an
effort to avoid any deterioration of relations between the United
States and China over human rights and other issues.
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton and other senior Administration officials
welcomed Secretary General Kofi Annan to Washington with a
sustained show of support apparently intended to minimize any
differences between Washington and the United Nations over how to
proceed with Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Relations of China's Ethnic Groups Become Closer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Reform and opening-up over the
past 20 years have cemented the ties of China's 56 ethnic groups,
said participants in the ongoing sessions of the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC) and the Ninth National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
Li Mutang of the Hui ethnic group said that the development of
transportation, telecommunications and cultural undertakings has
facilitated exchanges between the country's ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
"Long-term migration and blending between various ethnic groups
in history have made them dependent on each other," he said. "They
are more so than ever."
</P>
<P>
Shanghai and the Tibet Autonomous Region, for example, have
established close ties, and so have Yunnan and Heilongjiang
provinces, he said. Under the conditions of a market economy, all
the ethnic groups of the country are mutually benefiting one
another, he said.
</P>
<P>
"With such relations, the Chinese people of various
nationalities can never be separated by external forces," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Ma Like from the Uzbek ethnic group said that China has bid
farewell to an economy of shortages. The growing overall national
strength serves as a powerful backing for economic development in
areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, poverty eradication and economic take-off in
such areas will contribute greatly to the growth of the national
economy, Ma Like said.
</P>
<P>
Cultural blending between different ethnic groups is also
common. People of the Han ethnic group and other minority ethnic
groups are learning each other's languages, and many of them are
interested in the other's cultures, he said.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese President Tran
Duc Luong will begin a three-day state visit to Malaysia Monday,
aimed at further enhancing bilateral ties between the two
Southeast Asian nations, a Foreign Ministry statement here said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The visit will be the president's first visit abroad since

of state to Malaysia, which is to reciprocate the visit by
Malaysia's Supreme Head of State Tuanku Ja'afar to Vietnam in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Tran Duc Luong will be accompanied by a 35-member delegation
comprising several ministers, deputy ministers, senior government
officials and the country's business community, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad is expected to call
on the Vietnamese leader on the first day of the visit to exchange
views on bilateral, regional and international issues of common
concern.
</P>
<P>
The statement said, "The financial and economic situation in
the region is also expected to feature prominently in the prime
minister's discussions with the president."
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese leader is also scheduled to address leading
Malaysian businessmen at a luncheon to be organized by the
Malaysian National Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

<HEADLINE> India's Regional Party Demands Firm Commitment from BJP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The ALL-India Anna Dravida
Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and its allies are unlikely to give
their support for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to form the
next government unless the BJP makes a "firm commitment" on
various demands placed by the AIADMK, Press Trust of India (PTI)
reported Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the combine, which commands the loyalty of 27 MPs of
the Lower House of Parliament, said that of the demands put
forward by AIADMK supremo Jayalalitha, dismissal of the Dravida
Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) government in Tamil Nadu figured the
topmost. Next in the list was the allocation of finance and law
portfolios to Jayalalitha's nominees.
</P>
<P>
BJP's prime ministerial candidate Atal Behari Vajpayee has
expressed his inability to give any commitment on the demands such
as dismissal of the Tamil Nadu government.
</P>
<P>
Tough negotiations were still going on between the two sides to
reach a common ground as time appeared to be running out for
Vajpayee to give a response to the president's directive to
furnish documents supporting his claim of 252 out of 543 MPs in
the House.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to Vajpayee on Tuesday, President K. R. Narayanan
asked him whether his party, which has emerged the largest party
in the just concluded general elections, was "able and willing" to
form a "stable government".
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee called on the president Tuesday evening and claimed to
be able to form a stable government. Then the president asked him
to furnish documents of support and Vajpayee promised to do so on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It is yet to be known whether Vajpayee could call on the
president Thursday evening to present all the support documents to
him.
</P>
<P>
The president is unlikely to initiate any further action on the
formation of the next central government till he is fully
satisfied on the basis of documentary proof that the coalition
government to be formed by Vajpayee would be a stable one.

<HEADLINE> Over 30 Palestinians Injured in Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Over 30 Palestinian protesters
were injured in the West Bank city of Hebron on Thursday in
clashes with Israeli troops, according to the Palestinian press
service JMCC.
</P>
<P>
The clashes started Thursday morning when tens of hundreds of
local residents gathered in the center of the city to protest
against the bloody killing of three palestinian workers on
Tuesday by Israeli soldiers at the Tarkumiya roadblock near Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians threw stones and Molotov cocktails at the
Israeli soldiers who returned fire with rubber bullets and
tear-gas, injuring more than 30 Palestinians. The clashes were
continuing in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
In Bethlehem, another city in the West Bank, a large number of
Palestinians clashed with Israeli troops at the Rachel's Tomb. But
there was no report of injuries so far.
</P>
<P>
Three Israeli soldiers opened fire Tuesday at a van carrying
Palestinian workers returning from their job in Israel, killing
the driver and two others. The soldiers said they suspect the
driver tried to run over them in a terror attack, but the driver
was actually trying to cut into the line only.
</P>
<P>
The shooting incident triggered off widespread protests from
the Palestinians. Clashes between Palestinian protesters and
Israeli troops erupted on Wednesday in Hebron and Ramallah, and
over 50 Palestinians were reportedly injured.
</P>
<P>
In a move to calm the situation in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai telephoned
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) deputy head Mahmoud Abbas
Wednesday night to express sorrow over the killing.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai updated Abbas his visit late Wednesday to the
Tarkumiya roadblock and promised that details of the investigation
into the shooting would be relayed to the PNA. He called on Abbas
to help calm the tensions.
</P>
<P>
PNA President Yasser Arafat termed the killing as "a big crime
against the Palestinian workers." The PNA has asked to have an
international investigation of the incident.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the incident, Israeli President Ezer Weizman and
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu phoned Arafat to express their
sorrow over the killing.

LONDON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The first European conference
between the state leaders from the 15 European Union (EU)
countries and their counterparts from EU applicant central and
eastern European countries opened in London Thursday.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair told the opening ceremony
this was the first time countries from all over Europe had been

</P>
<P>
"The whole objective of the conference is to create a stable,
secure and prosperous Europe," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
Blair, whose country holds the present EU presidency, said EU
enlargement, the Kosovo crisis, organized crime, environment
protection and other issues of common concern were expected to be
discussed at the one-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told reporters: "This
(conference) does represent one of the important milestones toward
a new Europe, a European Union which will be stronger and a Europe
that will be united."
</P>
<P>
As a result of EU enlargement, Europe would finally put behind
the division which had scarred the continent for the latter half
of this century, Cook said.

the 15 EU members as well as from Bulgaria, the Czech Republic,

<HEADLINE> IBM's New Strategy In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.'s IBM has announced a
change in focus in China this year to small and medium-sized
enterprises, as a new strategy for increasing its share of the
information technology market.
</P>
<P>
IBM has a new generation of Intel-based servers called
Netfinity that will provide a platform for Electronic-Business,
according to George Man, IBM Greater China's general manager for
Netfinity.
</P>
<P>
E-Business allows business to be done on-line,
bringing costs down and increasing efficiency, by applying the
network and World Wide Web technologies to the work of modern
enterprises, he says, and especially gives small and medium-sized
businesses a chance to compete in the world market.
</P>
<P>
Because Electronic-Business is becoming increasingly popular in
many parts of the world, insiders say that bringing the huge
number of small and medium-sized enterprises on line is crucial.
</P>
<P>
IBM now has a large part of China's information technology
market and its turnover surged by more than 60 percent last year
from the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's King Leaves for Talks in Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's King Hussein left here for
the United States on Thursday for talks with President Bill
Clinton on the stalled Middle East peace process and Iraqi issue.
</P>
<P>
Hussein is expected to meet with Clinton on March 19. The talks
might focus on the peace negotiations between the Palestinians and
Israel and the prospects for a direct dialog between the U.S. and
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The king would emphasize the need for Israel to carry out troop
withdrawal from the West Bank under agreements signed with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He might propose that Washington and Baghdad hold a direct
dialog to patch up differences that appeared since the 1990-91
Gulf crisis, triggered off by Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, Jordan's
Prime Minister Abdul-Salam Majali told reporters earlier.
</P>
<P>
Hussein will also exert efforts to procure more U.S. aid for
Jordan. The U.S. aid for the kingdom in the fiscal year of 1998 is
estimated at around 200 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Before meeting Clinton, the 62-year-old king will have
regular medical checkups at the Mayo clinic in Minnesota. He
underwent surgery to remove cancer in 1992.
</P>
<P>
His visit came following a series of Israeli officials' visits
to Jordan aimed at restoring Jordanian-Israeli relations that have
deteriorated since last September's botched assassination attempt
by Israeli agents on a leader of the anti-Israeli movement Hamas.
</P>
<P>
The king just concluded a six-day Arab tour that included talks
with leaders of Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Oman.
</P>
<P>
Crown Prince Hassan paid visits to Ramallah in the West Bank
and Tel Aviv on Monday and Tuesday for talks with Palestinian and
Israeli officials on the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations,
which have been deadlocked since March 1997.

<HEADLINE> Wei Jianxing Stresses Fight against Corruption and Extravagance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Wei Jianxing, a high-ranking
Chinese official, today called for making persevering efforts to
combat corruption in a group discussion attended by deputies from
Heilongjiang province to the National People's Congress (NPC), in
session here since last week.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of China (CPC) and the Chinese government
have put great emphasis on improving the Party's work style,
building a clean government and fighting corruption, said Wei, who
is a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of
the CPC Central Committee and secretary of the CPC Central
Commission for Discipline Inspection.
</P>
<P>
Despite successes in the fight against corruption, he said,
corruption is still a severe problem in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Some forms of corruption have kept spreading," he said.
"People are not happy about the situation and hope that our Party
would take more resolute measures to achieve greater successes in
eradicating corruption."
</P>
<P>
Besides the need to continue the anti-corruption campaign, Wei
stressed the importance of leading an ethical way of life and
having a fine style of work.
</P>
<P>
"Party and government departments should promote a change of
social mood and ethics by having a correct lifestyle and a fine
style of work," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wei said that, while corrupted officials are after all few in
number, problems concerning lifestyle and style of work are
widespread.
</P>
<P>
"A few leading cadres are given to a life of comfort and
extravagance," he said. "They are corrupting our Party."
</P>
<P>
"Efforts at putting an end to extravagance must not be regarded
as 'much ado about nothing'," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wei called for an earnest implementation of an eight-point
Party and government decree that aims to put to a stop
extravagance and waste, including stipulations on the use of cell
phones by officials and a ban on gift giving at meetings.
</P>
<P>
Wei also called for concentrating resources on investigating
serious corruption cases and bringing to justice corrupted
officials.
</P>
<P>
"We should never allow corrupted elements to have a place to
hide within the Party, as Jiang Zemin has pointed out," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the importance of doing away with the root
causes of corruption and enhancing supervision over people with
power.

learning Putonghua is in high fashion in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Macao civil servants, students, clerks and
businessmen have joined the army of Putonghua learners, either for
better jobs, better business opportunities or a better future
after 1999 when Macao's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Behind the fashion is also the encouragement of the Macao
government and actual demand in their daily life, observers here
say.
</P>
<P>
Putonghua course was first launched in the late 1970s mainly to
train interpreters. It did not gain much momentum until China and
Portugal signed the Joint Declaration on the question of Macao in
1987.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, more and more people, especially civil
servants, have started learning Putonghua in their spare time.
</P>
<P>
The training course at the Macao Institute of Engineering
(MIE), the largest official language training center in Macao,
trained more than 2,000 Putonghua learners last year, and the
number is expected to approach 3,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
The language promotion center under the Department of Education
and Youth, the University of Macao and some other non-governmental
organizations are also running Putonghua training courses.
Putonghua course is compulsory in many local middle schools.
</P>
<P>
Observers say the fact that civil servants make up the
remarkable proportion among Putonghua learners is closely
connected to the approaching of the handover.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese language is increasingly widely used with the
implementation of the policy of 'using Chinese as an official
language,'" said Lei Heong Iok, vice-president of the MIE, in an
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"If the civil servants do not command good Chinese, they will
have difficulties in their work and daily life in the future. Many
of them have now realized that," he said.
</P>
<P>
He told Xinhua that government officials at different levels
have been to his institute to study Chinese. Among the top names
are the president of the Macao Legislative Assembly, a
vice-president of the Leal Senado (Municipal Council) and the
director of the Macao Posts and Telecommunications Department.
Many, including Macao-born Portuguese civil servants, also sent
their children to the training seminar to learn Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The efforts of the Macao government and the support from
China's inland areas are important factors to fuel the fashion,
observers noted.
</P>
<P>
Following the signing of the Joint Declaration, the Macao
government promptly announced policies to encourage the promotion
of both Portuguese and Chinese in Macao. Universities and other
related language bodies in China's inland areas gave great support
to the promotion of Chinese language in Macao as well.
</P>
<P>
For most ordinary citizens, they learn Putonghua because they
need it. Exchanges in cultural, political and economic fields with
 China's inland areas have increased, and Putonghua-speaking
visitors to Macao more than doubled in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
"It is now a must for many businessmen and clerks to be able to
 speak Putonghua now," an analyst said, adding that "To them,
speaking Putonghua means better business and better job
opportunities."

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Reported U.S. Official's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 12 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian Foreign Ministry
official has denied a report by a newspaper here that a U.S. State
Department official recently visited Iran.
</P>
<P>
According to Iran's official news agency IRNA today, the
official said the report was "incorrect." Only a group of scholars
of different nationalities arrived here last week to attend a
conference on security in the Persian Gulf held by the Foreign
Ministry, he said.
</P>
<P>
The participants, including a number of Americans, held no
official post but were present for scientific purposes, said the
official, who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
Contacts between Iranians and Americans are increasing after
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami called for cultural dialogue
between the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Last month, several American foreign policy experts, including
Geoffrey Kemp, a security aide in the Reagon administration,
visited Iran and held talks with Iranian officials.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Washington and Tehran intend to test the
possibility of government-to-government dialogue by first
promoting cultural exchanges. Officials from both sides are guard
against such a speculation.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S. Africa's New Budget Gets Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 12 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's 1998/99
budget, unveiled Wednesday, received much praise from business
circles and economists for laying the foundation for sustained
growth and job creation and meanwhile drew fire from opposition
parties.
</P>
<P>
Business organizations and economists hailed the
201-billion-Rand (40.2-billion-U.S. Dollars) budget as one that
would boost economic growth while tackling social issues such as
crime, health and education.
</P>
<P>
They appreciated the attempts by Finance Minister Trevor
Manuel, who announced the budget Wednesday, to ease the tax
burden on low and middle-income class, and provide relief to the
poor.
</P>
<P>
The budget increased spending on the police, justice and
correctional services by 12 percent, to a total of 20.675 billion
Rand (4.135 billion Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Education services got a lion's share of 28 percent of the
budget, or 45 billion Rand (9.04 billion Dollars), and health
received 14 percent or 23 billion Rand (4.6 billion Dollars).
</P>
<P>
With an increase of 5 billion Rand (1 billion Dollars) to 19
billion Rand (3.82 billion Dollars) in welfarFE, Welfare Minister
Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi announced that social security grants
would rise by 4.3 percent from July.
</P>
<P>
The allocation to poverty relief projects will rise from 500
million Rand (100 million Dollars) in 1997/98 to 800 million Rand
(160.6 million Dollars) in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The budget raised levies on cigarettes, alcohol and fuel. The
levies, which are expected to generate an additional 2.51 billion
Rand (504 million Dollars) in revenue, would enable the
government to make tax concessions to the poor while containing
national deficit within acceptable limits.
</P>
<P>
The South African Chamber of Business said Manuel had laid a
solid foundation for economic growth and further interest-rate
cuts.
</P>
<P>
The South African Agricultural Union said the budget was in
line with the Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR)
macro-economic strategy. GEAR, adopted in 1996, highlights a
competitive fast-growing economy and targets job creation and
poverty relief.
</P>
<P>
The steel and engineering industries said the budget
demonstrated the government's firm commitment to sound financial
management and planning, in line with sound macro-economic
principles.
</P>
<P>
Automobile manufacturers also welcomed the budget, saying it
indicated government recognition of the importance of investment
growth and the critical role of business in market expansion,
economic growth and job creation.
</P>
<P>
The National NGO (non-governmental organization) Coalition
hailed the budget for its plan to establish a job creation fund,
saying the move indicated Manuel's recognition of unemployment as
a major problem.
</P>
<P>
However, the budget came under criticism from opposition
parties as well as an ally of the ruling African National
Congress, the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU).
</P>
<P>
The National Party (NP), the biggest opposition par$9, said
the budget contained no imaginative steps to enhance economic
growth and job creation despite predictions that the unemployment
rate now standing at 29 percent would soar to 40 percent within
10 years.
</P>
<P>
The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) said the greatest weakness of
the budget was its "failure to comply with a number of
fundamental requirements of the GEAR strategy", together with its
little effort to "compel productive economic activity and
industrial expansion".
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party (DP), a white-based opposition party,
also slammed the budget for ignoring some of GEAR's elements,
such as greater labor market flexibility, public service reform
and privatization.
</P>
<P>
COSATU and the Pan Africanist Congress, both black-based
parties, attacked the budget for doing little to create jobs.
</P>
<P>
COSATU, which is in the tripartite government coalition, said
Manuel had put more rhetorics in his budget speech than providing
concrete steps to alleviate joblessness.

<P>
NANNING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The service industry in south
China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has absorbed nearly 60
percent of the region's laid-off workers, according to local
officials.
</P>
<P>
Some 155,900 laid-off workers found new jobs last year,

those people, found jobs in the service sector.
</P>
<P>

structure. Transportation, telecommunications, financial services,
commercial centers, hotels and tourism were greatly boosted.
</P>
<P>
Nanning, the region's capital, now has 21,800 job-seekers, said
Mayor Lin Guoqiang.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Arafat Reaffirms Commitment to Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat on Thursday reaffirmed Palestinian
commitment to continuing the peace process with Israel despite
the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Gaza city, Arafat said the recent
wave of violence should not be allowed to stop the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that the Palestinians are still committed to
advancing the peace process in spite of all what they are facing.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the comments as Palestinian violence against
Israeli troops in the territories entered the third day to protest
the Tuesday killing of three Palestinians at a roadblock near West
Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Three Israeli soldiers opened fire at a van carrying
Palestinian workers returning from their job in Israel, saying
they suspected the driver tried to run over them in a terror
attack.
</P>
<P>
Some 14 Palestinians were reportedly injured in clashes in
various places in the territories, including Hebron and
Bethlehem. On Wednesday, at least 30 Palestinians were wounded by
rubber bullets fired by Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Arafat had condemned the killing as "a big crime," but
Palestinian police acted to help control the situation following
Israeli leaders' expression of regrets and condolences over the
incident.
</P>
<P>
The latest crisis highlighted the simmering tension between
Israel and the Palestinian side at a time when the peace talks are
deadlocked. Disputes over Israel's delayed troop redeployments in
West Bank and continued expansion of Jewish settlements have
prevented any progress in forging a permanent peace in the region.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua)-- A senior Tibet official today
denounced separatist activities by the Dalai Lama and called for
taking a firm stand against separatism.
</P>
<P>
Ginzom Gyincainpuncog, vice-chairman of the Tibet Regional
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), said the Dalai Lama has never stopped
attempting to split China by plotting and stirring up troubles in
Tibet in collaboration with international forces hostile to China.
</P>
<P>
"He even teams up with elments advocating 'Taiwan
independence'," Ginzom said, addressing a full session of the
CPPCC National Committee, of which he is a member.
</P>
<P>
"The Dalai Lama is the ringleader of a political clique seeking
Tibet independence, a faithful tool of international forces that
are hostile to China and the biggest obstacle to the establishment
of a normal order of Tibetan Buddhism," Ginzom said.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan official cited social and economic achievements
Tibet has made during reform and opening to the outside world and
with the support of the central government and people across the
country.
</P>

and taking the socialist road can Tibet have a bright future,"
Ginzom said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Oil Experts Arrive in Baghdad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 12 (Xinhua) -- A group of United Nations oil
experts arrived in Baghdad Thursday afternoon on a mission to
evaluate Iraq's oil production capability under an enhanced
oil-for-food program, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Head of the group, Jalace Graham, said upon arrival at the
Habbaniya military airport, 80 kilometers west of Baghdad, that
his group will stay in Iraq for two weeks to determine how much
oil Iraq can produce, how much it would be able to export.
</P>
<P>
Eric Falt, spokesman for the Office of U.N. Humanitarian
Coordinator in Iraq, told a press conference earlier Thursday that
the group of 14 oil experts will hold talks with U.N. officials
upon arrival, and then in the evening, with Iraqi officials from
ministries of foreign affairs and oil.
</P>
<P>
Falt said these oil experts will go to Iraq's northern city of
Kirkuk and southern oil field in Basra to examine oil facilities
and evaluate Iraq's need for new equipment, spare parts and
repairs to its oil facilities.
</P>
<P>
Under a U.N. Security Council resolution adopted last month,
the amount of oil Iraq can sell in six months has been increased
to 5.2 billion U.S. dollars for the third phase of oil-for-food
deal, from 2 billion dollars for the first and second phases, to
alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraq said it is unable to pump that much oil due to
price decline on world oil markets and the lack of equipment and
spare parts in its oil sector. It has asked the U.N. to allow it
to import equipment and spare parts.
</P>
<P>
Crushing economic sanctions have been imposed on Iraq by the
United Nations since its invasion in 1990 of Kuwait and inflicted
grave suffering to the Iraqi people.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Further support for News Corp
shares led the Australian share market higher Thursday, offsetting
nervousness about an imminent dip.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index closed 4.7 point higher at 2719.5
despite general weakness among resources stocks.
</P>
<P>
Traders said there was some nervousness that Wall Street, which
closed at a record high overnight, could retreat.
</P>
<P>
"The market opened a fraction firmer and we have virtually
followed the futures all day today," said Peter Struk from
Reynolds &AMP; Co, noting that there had been no indications from
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Volumes had not been high and the market had been
directionless, he said.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index rose 17.5 points to 4675.2, due to
buying in a few major stocks.
</P>
<P>
News Corp was again on the rise, with the ordinary shares
rising 20 cents to 10.15 Australian dollars and the preferred
shares improving 13.5 cents to 8.49 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Rupert Murdoch's commitments to cost reduction and the
likelihood of continued good box office receipts for 20th Century
Fox's Titanic after the Academy Awards were some reasons offered
to account for News Corp's recent strong run.
</P>
<P>
Telstra interim receipts moved back toward their highs, rising
six cents.
</P>
<P>
Banking stocks were mixed, with National Australia Bank up 22.3
cents while Commonwealth fell 18, ANZ was three cents weaker and
Westpac improved 1.4 cents.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index closed 6.8 points down at 1157.6.

BHP drifted 19 cents lower and WMC dropped 5.6.

The gold index fell 5.6 points to 1103.2 as the bullion price

<HEADLINE> WB: Raising Interest Rates Wrong Medicine for Asian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Raising interest rates is a "wrong
medicine" for the ailing East Asian economies, including the
Philippines, a World Bank (WB) chief economist said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a forum organized by the WB and the Asian Development Bank
on ways of dealing with the financial crisis, Joseph Stiglitz,
also senior president of the WB, said the move has been working in
Latin America because of high inflation and fiscal imbalances
there.
</P>
<P>
"But in the case of East Asia, raising the interest rates would
exacerbate the situation (currency crisis) because of the
declining domestic demand," he said, adding that the inflation
rates and fiscal position of the region have been kept within
manageable levels.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, the extremely high interest rates, standing
at between 25 and 40 percent, not only failed to stabilize the
peso, but also dampened the economy and drew the massive protest
of the business community.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Central Bank had shifted its focus of attention
to reducing the interest rates from intervening in the foreign
exchange market, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Stiglitz, however, said that raising the interest rates during
the financial crisis also has its credit. It can demonstrate
commitment to monetary authorities, strengthen macroeconomic
stability and attract more funds into the region, he added.
</P>
<P>
To minimize the pain brought about by the financial turmoil, he
said the World Bank is working on a program that aims at
strengthening the financial sector in the region.
</P>
<P>
The week-long forum was attended by some 350 government
officials, economists and journalists who discussed the lessons of
the financial crisis and the region's future development
strategies.

The Sri Lankan diplomat was asked by U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan to head of a special group of diplomats to escort arms
inspectors to the presidential sites, previously off-limits. The
inspections are expected to start later this month.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said Iraq is keen to implement its accord with Annan and
to cooperate with the United Nations to ensure "transparent and
objective effectuation that would observe Iraq's sovereignty,
dignity and national security."
</P>
<P>
He hoped inspections of presidential palaces would "reveal the
truth and lay bare the falsities fabricated over these sites."
</P>
<P>
Dhanapala underlined United Nations commitment to applying the
accord as soon as possible and in good will, taking into
consideration of Iraq's legitimate concerns.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed Iraq's readiness for cooperation on the road to
sound, objective implementation of the agreement on weapons
inspection in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed Annan and Aziz, Iraq agrees to open
eight presidential palaces to special groups comprising senior
diplomats appointed by Annan and experts drawn from the
U.N. Special Commission on disarming Iraq and the International
Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
Dhanapala arrived here Wednesday on his first visit to Iraq. "I
have come to prepare the ground for the inspection of the eight
presidential sites," he told the media upon arrival.

<HEADLINE> Resettlement Project Benefits Kazak Herdsmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The fact that Beshan, a Kazak
herdsman living in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, had
never seen a 50-yuan note prior to 1994, had little influence on
his family's 1997 earnings of 30,000 yuan and total assets of
200,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The family of nine is one of more than 4,000 Xinjiang families
which have participated in the region's resettlement project.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the project is to move more than 50,000 households
out of remote mountainous areas. Hami Prefecture in eastern
Xinjiang has assumed the lead in related efforts.
</P>
<P>
The prefecture has relocated 1,600 families of herdsmen, with
their annual per capita having since jumped to over 1,000
yuan. The prefecture also organized resettled farmers to explain
their successful experiences.
</P>
<P>
The successful efforts have convinced an increasing number of
herdsmen to follow suit. For example, Hami planned to relocate 600
households in 1997, but actually moved more than 800 families by
the end of the year.

NINGBO, March 12 (Xinhua) -- People who visit Ningbo, a coastal
city in east China's Zhejiang Province, are surprised to see the
large area of lawns emerging in this port city with many highrise
buildings and well-lighted streets.
</P>
<P>
Local officials have attributed the additional landscaping to
recent government efforts.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the city has more than 2,000 hectares of grass,
including 120 hectares planted in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Forest belts have been planted along the city's nine major
thoroughfares and six rivers. Trees also have been planted on more
than 60 residential blocks.
</P>
<P>
This year, the city government plans to expand the landscaping
program by 50 hectares, which will increase the city's per capita
lawn coverage by 0.8 square meters. Last year, the city's per
capita lawn coverage rose by 0.6 square meters. The city will also
invest 50 million yuan to plant 6.5 million trees in the next five
years.

<HEADLINE> Macao CPPCC Member on Macao's Return to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- A Macao member of the Ninth
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), the top advisory body, said here today that
people in Macao are confident in the region's smooth return to
the motherland at the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
"The return of Macao constitutes another great event for the
Chinese nation," said Member Ho Teng Iat, a noted entrepreneur in
Macao, at a speech meeting of the ongoing First Session of the
Ninth CPPCC National Committee this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Ho said that Macao's return would put a complete end to the
history in which Chinese territory is occupied and ruled by
foreigners, and thoroughly wash off the historical humiliation of
the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
"The return of Macao is of great historical and realistic
significance to the peaceful reunification of the motherland, as
well as to China's reinvigoration," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that with its 400-year-plus history as a free harbor
and long-practiced policy of a free economy with low taxes, Macao
will still play a major role in promoting trade and economic
exchanges between China and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
"The tremendous achievements scored by the motherland's
interior areas in economic growth have provided a powerful backing
for Macao's long-term prosperity and stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
With only one year and nine months to go before Macao returns
to China, he said, it is necessary to step up various kinds of
preparatory work.
</P>
<P>
"The Portuguese side should be urged to take quickest possible
actions to settle major problems related to Macao's return, such
as those to localize Macao's civil service, localize laws and
confirm the Chinese as the official language of Macao," he noted.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Nuclear Powers to Stick to Nuclear Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Disarmament Ambassador Li
Changhe has called on the countries possessing the largest and
most advanced nuclear arsenals to continue to fulfill their
special responsibilities and obligations for nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Li made the statement here Thursday in a plenary session of the
Conference on Disarmament (CD).
</P>
<P>
"They should carry out further drastic reductions of their
nuclear arsenals, abandon the strategy of nuclear deterrence, stop
the research in and development and proliferation of missile
defense systems, which undermine the global strategic security and
stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said he believed that the nuclear powers' fulfillment of
their special responsibilities and obligations for nuclear
disarmament would help create necessary conditions for all the
nuclear-weapon states to participate in the nuclear disarmament
negotiation process in the future.
</P>
<P>
He noted that some members of the CD have already put forward a
series of proposals on the establishment of working mechanisms for
nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese delegation hopes that on the basis of full
exchange of views, a commonly acceptable formula can be found to
address and discuss nuclear disarmament in the CD, and we will
support such endeavors," Li said.

<HEADLINE> China Opposes Arms Race in Outer Space: Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- All countries, especially those
with advanced space capabilities, should refrain from the
development of outer space weapons, Chinese Disarmament Ambassador
Li Changhe said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"They should take concrete actions to prevent an arms race in
outer space," Li said when delivering a formal statement in a
plenary session of the Conference on Disarmament (CD).
</P>
<P>
Outer space belongs to the whole mankind and should be used
solely for peaceful purposes for the benefit of humanity, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the existing international legal instruments related
to outer space are far from adequate for effective prevention of
arms race in outer space.
</P>
<P>
"Like other countries, China is concerned about some activities
in the development and testing of components of outer space
weapons or weapons systems in recent years," Li said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation maintains that the CD should
re-establish the Ad Hoc Committee on the prevention of arms race
in outer space, according to Li.
</P>
<P>
He said that China also supports the appointment of a special
coordinator, as the first step, to organize discussions and
consultations on issues related to outer space, with a view to
re-establishing the Ad Hoc Committee to conduct negotiations on
the prohibition of arms race in outer space.
</P>
<P>
Li pledged that the Chinese delegation will take an active part
in the relevant deliberations and will expound China's position on
this issue.

<HEADLINE> China Enjoys Booming Computer Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- China's computer market is
expected to grow to over 200 billion yuan (24 billion US dollars)
annually by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 Review of the China Computer Market and Forecasts for
1998-2000 released today by a government research institute showed
that the computer industry's total sales for 1997 hit 130 billion
yuan (15.6 billion US dollars), up 41.3 percent on 1996.
</P>
<P>
The three pillars of the computer industry -- hardware, software
and information technology services -- registered rapid growth
on previous years.
</P>
<P>
Hardware, which accounted for the lion's share of the
industry's total sales, witnessed a 45.5 percent rise on the
previous year to end 1997 at 104 billion yuan, or 80 percent of
total sales for the year.
</P>
<P>
Software sales grew by 21.7 percent to 11.2 billion yuan, with
revenues from information technology services growing by 31
percent to 14.8 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Personal computers (PCs), the most popular item, retained their
vigorous competitive edge in the computer market, with over 3.5
million PCs valued at 41.5 billion yuan sold during 1997. The
figures represented 66 percent growth in the PC market during the
year and PCs accounted for some 92 percent of the total number of
computers sold during the year.
</P>
<P>
Applications software held a 63.2 percent share of the total
software market, with systems software registering the most rapid
growth rate of 61.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The total volume for computer trading continued to grow rapidly
in 1997, with the total value of imports and exports reaching
13.16 billion US dollars, up 33.1 percent on the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The growth was mainly due to the increasing number of joint
ventures major international computer companies established in
China.
</P>
<P>
Computer exports grew by 34.9 percent on 1996 to 8.73 billion
US dollars, with imports rising by 29.5 percent to 4.43 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sources from relevant government departments pointed out that
China's computer market has entered the maturation stage. They
also noted that local computer industries, especially the PC
industry, have kept pace with the worldwide industry in terms of
research and development, marketing and applications.
</P>
<P>
Forecasts indicate that China's computer market will record
total 1998 sales of 165 billion yuan, with the figure expected to
grow to over 200 billion yuan in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Meeting on How to Improve Skin Quality Held in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Tanners
Association (ETA) and Pittards Plc, probably the world's largest
producer of glove leather, held their ninth annual meeting here
recently on how to improve skin quality.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, co-chaired by ETA Chairman Alem Asfaw and
Managing Director of Pittards Plc Rag Hankey, also discussed
ongoing technical advances in the industry and environmental
issues, ''The Ethiopian Herald'' reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Forty participants of the meeting later agreed on the
importance of improving the state of raw skin in order to
increase the country's foreign currency earnings.
</P>
<P>
Many options were proposed and discussed by the participants
to assist the Ethiopian tanning industry in producing better
quality raw materials in future and process it to international
standards.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have agreed to form a joint committee so as to
follow up the implementation of the recommendations reached at
the end of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia stands first in Africa and tenth in the world in its
livestock resource. Hides and skins export is second largest
export item in the country next to coffee.
</P>
<P>
However, the quality of hides and skins affect the income of
hard currency. For example, Ethiopian tanneries lose nearly seven
million Dollars due to defects caused by sheep skin disease every
year.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Leader Agrees to Return to Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said
Thursday that he wanted his party back at the Northern Ireland
talks table "as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
But he said it was up to the leadership in the party to make a
decision on that matter.
</P>
<P>
"My own view is that we should seek to go back into the talks
at the earliest possible opportunity. But that is not a decision
for me alone. We are a collective leadership. We will consult,"
Adams told reporters outside 10 Downing Street after meeting with
British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army
(IRA), was expelled from the multi-party peace talks last month
for IRA's alleged involvement in two killings.
</P>
<P>
The party was allowed to rejoin the talks on March 9 on
condition that IRA take no more terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
However, Sinn Fein insists that it would not return to the talk
table until a meeting between Adams and Blair.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his meeting with Blair, Adams said the talks were
a "good, positive engagement."
</P>
<P>
He also said he hoped the nationalists and unionists in
Northern Ireland could resolve their differences at the talk table.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein struggles for the separation of Northern Ireland from
Britain and then a unification with the Republic of Ireland. But Sinn
Fein's participation to the peace process is crucial if Britain
and Ireland are to win a settlement that could be endorsed by both
Catholics and Protestants, alienated by a quarter century of
sectarian strife.

<HEADLINE> US Conditions for Backing Abacha's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States has pledged to
accept Nigeria's head of state General Sani Abacha as the next
civilian president provided the decision to draft him inro the
presidential race is a "collective one."
</P>
<P>
Although Washington canvasses a free and fair process in
choosing candidates for the August presidential election, it will
recognize Abacha if he emerges as president through an open
contest.
</P>
<P>
Disclosing this Wednesday in the Nigerian capital Abuja,
William Twaddell, U.S. ambassador to the country, cautioned the
Nigerian government to leave the contest open to all Nigerians to
participate in, the press reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. position is similar to th view of Salim Ahmed Salim,
secretary-general of the Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
Salim said here Monday on his way to Sierra Leone to attend
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's reinstatement ceremony that only
Nigerians can decide whether General Abacha should succeed
himself.
</P>
<P>
Under the Nigerian military government's transition to civil
rule program, presidential election will start on August 1 and
the elected government will be inaugurated two months later.
</P>
<P>
However, no official presidential candidate has been produced
by the five political parties less than five months ahead of the
election, apparently waiting for the decision of the head of
state.
</P>
<P>
Abacha, who started to head the current administration in late
1993, has been tight-mouthed on whether or not he wants to
succeed himself, saying that the issue should be decided by the
constituency.
</P>
<P>
Recently, campaigns to support or oppose Abacha to run the
race have gained momentum.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a two-day two-million-man carnival-like rally was
held in the capital to ask Abacha to contest the forthcoming
election. The rally, supported by the government, went on in good
order under tight police protection.
</P>
<P>
However, another five-million-man rally in Lagos, the economic
center of the country, organized by pro-democracy and anti-Abacha
groups, was dispersed by armed police before it officially took
off last Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
While the anti-Abacha campaigners are voicing protest against
the police suppression, the Abuja rally organizers have announced
to hold similar activities in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
It is predicted that the head of state would break the silence
under mounting pressure.

<HEADLINE> UN Calls for Aid to Transport Links in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 12 (Xinhua) - The United Nations has
appealed for immediate aid to repair the flood-hit transport
links to ease serious food shortages in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"Priority should be focused on transport constraints and
moving food as soon as possible to areas of need rather than on
injecting further quantities of relief food," the World Food
Program (WFP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
said in a joint report issued Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report, based on a joint assessment mission conducted
recently, said a poor transport network was acting as a severe
constraint on Tanzania's economic development.
</P>
<P>
"In the coming months, logistical limitations in food movement
and the pace at which transport difficulties are resolved will be
as important determinants of food security as the overall food
supply situation in the country," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The figures provided by the Food Security Department said
Tanzania's stock of cereals, mainly maize, stood at an estimated
350,000 tons at the beginning of February and per-capita cereal
consumption in Tanzania, whose population is about 30 million,
was at some 192 kg per year.
</P>
<P>
President Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania, which suffered a severe
drought in late 1996 and early 1997 and destructive floods
resulted from the unprecedented rainfall attributed to the El
Nino weather phenomenon in late 1997 and early this year, has

While donors responded generously and Tanzania waived import

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Ruling Party Wins Local Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's ruling National
Resistant Movement (NRM) has won the sub-county level local
election, the New Vision reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Among the 672 declared Local Council Three (LC3) chairmanships
in sub-counties, 539 were won by NRM, 88 by oppositions and 45
are still to be established by their winner's political
affiliation, the report said.
</P>
<P>
There are 895 sub-counties in Uganda, each having a chairman
which is elected by secret ballot.
</P>
<P>
Under the election rule in Uganda, voters elect their
executive committee and its chairman in villages, before the
elected form Local Council One and elect the executive committee
and its chairman of the upper-level parish.
</P>
<P>
Members of the parish, sub-county, county, district executive
committees form the Local Council Two, Three, Four and Five and
elect the higher level executive committee and its chairman.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has some 45,000 villages, 5,000 parishes, 900
sub-counties, 70 counties and 45 districts.
</P>
<P>
NRM enjoyed overwhelming victories in the western part of the
country, while the opposition won in some central sub-counties.
</P>
<P>
But P. Kintu, the new chairman in Nakawa, an electorate in
Kampala, explained that the NRM lost the polls in some areas in
Kampala due to lack of discipline among the ranks of NRM, which
had resulted in split ballots.
</P>
<P>
Local people enjoyed the mode of government of NRM, and were
not sure what will happen if the opposition won the election, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan authorities insisted that NRM is not a political
party, with President Yoweri Museveni saying that the multi-party
system causes only chaos and tribalism in his country.

<HEADLINE> China's Stone Material Industry Setting Fast Growth Pace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 12 (Xinhua) -- China's stone material industry
has sustained an annual growth rate of more than 25 percent since
1981 to become the fastest growing sector in the building material
industry.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wenbo, vice-chairman of the China Stone Materials
Industry Association, released this information at the opening
ceremony of the first national exhibition of stone materials and
its auxiliary machinery held yesterday in Quanzhou, a city of
Fujian Province in east China.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, China's output of granite, marble, terrazzo
and artificial stone materials is second only to Italy. The
industry, which produced 120 million square meters last year,
employs 2.6 million people and has an annual output value of more
than 30 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Stone materials have replaced cement in first place in China's
building materials exports, he said. In 1997, the industry did 1.1
billion U.S. dollars in foreign trade with 760 million
U.S. dollars of exports, in notable contrast to the 40,000
U.S. dollars of exports in 1981.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the growth of the industry has stimulated
its auxiliary industries, saying that before the 1990s China had
to import stone technology and equipment. Less than a decade
later, it has hundreds of machinery producers nationwide, whose
products have not only satisfied the domestic market but also been
exported to Southeast Asian, Mideast and East European countries.
</P>
<P>
There are still some problems, however, in further development,
Zhang said. The technology of China's stone industry is low
compared to developed countries and its production scale is
small, he said.

<P>
HONG KONG, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The forthcoming Legislative
Council (LC) election is a historic event for the residents of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), an SAR government
official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Constitutional Affairs Michael Suen said the
election, scheduled for May 25 this year, is of historic
significance as it is the first ever since Hong Kong's handover
and the establishment of the SAR in July last year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a kick-off ceremony here on Thursday of an
exhibition to promote the election, Suen said the LC speaks for
the SAR residents and its work is closely linked with their daily
life. Participating in the voting to elect their representatives
to the council is both the right and obligation of the SAR's
eligible voters, he added.
</P>
<P>
Suen said all information concerning the election will be
provided to residents and voters through various means including
the media, a special publication and direct mailings to voters'
homes.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, to be followed by a series of others throughout
Hong Kong, tells visitors of the functions of the LC, the division
of constituencies, key events and other election-related matters.

<HEADLINE> HK Appropriation Bill 1998 Debated at PLC Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Provisional
Legislative Council (PLC) members debated the Appropriation Bill
1998 during the two afternoon sessions starting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Bill, which was introduced to the PLC by Financial
Secretary Donald Tsang Yam-kuen of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) on February 18 this year, sets out
the government's expenditure proposals for the following
financial year.
</P>
<P>
During the debate which lasted more than 10 hours, PLC members
delivered speeches one after another, expressing their universal
support to the Bill and at the same time presenting their opinions
and suggestions.
</P>
<P>
Lau Hon-chuen said the Bill has been concentrated the wisdom of
the Hong Kong people and formulated on the basis of soliciting
the residents' opinions.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Tu Elsie quoted Tsang as saying that the conditions under
which he had framed the budget were the most complex faced by a
financial secretary for many years.
</P>
<P>
"I agree with him," she said, adding that Tsang is to be
congratulated on his achievement in those difficult circumstances.
</P>
<P>
"He has given us hope and inspiration that we can ride out the
storm and renew Hong Kong's strength," she said.
</P>
<P>
She stressed: "We need determination, and the dedication of
every department to put Sir Donald's hope into reality".
</P>
<P>
Dr. Leong Che-hung said the Bill has indeed reflected social
demands, proposing to reduce the burden on salaries taxpayers and
raise allowances for individuals or married persons.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said the cutting of taxes and the increasing of
public expenditure are proposed under a prerequisite for ensuring
increased surpluses.
</P>
<P>
In a word, the present Bill is completely different from the
previous ones before Hong Kong returned to China last July, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The suggestions and opinions raised by PLC members during the
sessions mainly focused on such issues as the adjustment of light
diesel oil duty, investment in education and policy on medical and
health work.
</P>
<P>
In addition, members of the PLC also addressed questions for
written replies from the SAR government on various policy areas
during the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Air Pollution, Illegal Dumping, HK Top Environmental Problems: SAR Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Worsening air pollution and
illegal dumping have become the most prominent problems that
officials of Hong Kong's Environmental Protection Department (EPD)
are to tackle, director of the department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We have had another busy year with some significant successes.
We can not pretend, however, that Hong Kong's environment is in
good shape," said Robert J.S. Law in an annual press briefing
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Emissions from diesel engines are one of the main causes of
Hong Kong's air pollution problems and a pilot scheme is being
conducted to introduce liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) fueled taxis
in the hope of replacing the existing diesel fueled taxis.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the local taxi trade will soon agree that LPG
taxis are acceptable in both operational and economic terms," said
Law.
</P>
<P>
To reduce air pollution, the EPD has managed to further
lower the sulfur content in automotive diesel to 0.05 percent and
introduced much tougher emission standards (Euro II standards) for
large diesel vehicles.
</P>
<P>
And it has also completed a pilot scheme for using a tougher,
dynamometer-based method for checking smoke emissions from diesel
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Illegal dumping is on the rise, according to the department
chief. At least 150 sites have been found for illegal disposal of
such wastes as those from construction sites, and dead animals and
rubber tires.
</P>
<P>
Law said that through various elements of a plan to be
released around the middle of this year, it is hoped to achieve
significant reduction in the amount of waste that must be disposed
 of at Hong Kong's landfills.
</P>
<P>
One of the most important elements of the plan will be the
introduction of large, waste-to-energy incinerators and an ongoing
study of providing latest technology is expected to be finished by
the end of this financial year, according to Law.
</P>
<P>
The EPD will also work in other key areas, such as phasing out
of noisy percussive piling hammers in built-up areas and making
proposals for retrofitting existing roads with noise abatement
measures, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Disarmament Ambassador Li
Changhe reaffirmed here Thursday that China has always stood for
the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
The cessation of nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament is
the first agenda item of the Conference on Disarmament (CD) and
also an issue to which all countries attach great importance, Li
said when delivering his first formal statement in a plenary
session of the CD in his capacity of the new Chinese Ambassador
for Disarmament Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that China has been opposed to the nuclear arms race
and the policy of nuclear deterrence, Li said:
</P>
<P>
"Since the very first day when it came into possession of
nuclear weapons, China has undertaken not to be the first to use
such weapons at any time and under any circumstances.
</P>
<P>
"It has also made unilateral and unconditional commitment not
to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against
non-nuclear-weapon states or nuclear-weapon-free zones.
</P>
<P>
"China has all along supported the efforts of
non-nuclear-weapon states to establish nuclear-weapon-free zones
on a voluntary basis."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Li pointed out, China's nuclear weapons do not
constitute a threat to any country.
</P>
<P>
China actively participated in the negotiations on the
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and signed the
treaty, Li said. It supports the commencement of negotiations in
the CD on a convention banning the production of fissile material
for nuclear weapons.

<P>
MANILA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
approved Thursday a 500 million U.S. dollar loan to Thailand to
mitigate the impact of the economic crisis, especially on the poor
and disadvantaged.
</P>
<P>
This is the first major assistance for the social sector in the
current currency crisis and is the biggest social-sector loan ever
provided by the ADB, a news release from the Manila-based bank
said.
</P>
<P>
The loan is part of the ADB's 1.2 billion dollars contribution
to the 17.2 billion dollars IMF-led rescue package.
</P>
<P>
The loan will help the social sector program developed by the
Thai government with the assistance of the ADB in cooperation with
a number of donor agencies.
</P>
<P>
The program will support reforms in the labor, health and
social welfare and education sectors.
</P>
<P>
It is specifically designed to support poor people who have
been laid off as a result of the current economic crisis, students
who may have to drop out of school due to their parents' increased
hardship, and other vulnerable groups.
</P>
<P>
It will also initiate structural reforms to boost the
competitiveness of the Thai economy by developing human resources
and reducing inefficiencies in social services.
</P>
<P>
To help implement the program, the ADB has also approved three
technical assistance grants totaling 2.1 million dollars, to help
the government establish systems to monitor the social impact of
the crisis.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Yasuo
Matsushita said Thursday he had offered to resign to take the
blame for the arrest of a senior BOJ official suspected of
accepting bribes.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Matsushita said he telephoned Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto Wednesday and expressed his intention to step
down.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto is expected to release Matsushita from his duties
before the central bank makes institutional changes in line with a
revised central bank law, which from April will give it greater
independence, government sources said.
</P>
<P>
Matsushita's five-year term of office was to expire in December
1999.
</P>
<P>
Senior Deputy Governor Toshihiko Fukui is widely believed to be
a strong candidate for the top BOJ position. But since he is
already a high-ranking officer at the bank, which is mired in
scandal, opposition could limit him to only an interim
appointment, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Tokyo prosecutors arrested Yasuyuki Yoshizawa,
chief of the Capital Markets Division at the BOJ Credit and Market
Management Department. He was suspected of taking bribes worth 4.3
million yen (about 33,858 U.S. dollars) in the form of
entertainment over four years from two major commercial banks, in
exchange for confidential information about central bank
operations in the financial market.

dollars, compared to 59.8 million dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The 30-percent profit growth was attained due to an upturn of
sales and rental income of the company's properties, the Daily
Star quoted the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
The company succeeded in selling a total of 136,223 square
meters of floor space at an average price of 1,056 dollars per
square meter, the report said.
</P>
<P>
But most of the company's net profit lay in the sales of 144
million dollars in real estate in central Beirut. Solidere is
leading a multi-billion-dollar strive to rebuild the war-ravaged
capital.
</P>
<P>
"The Management is confident that the outlook for 1998 is
promising, based on the current activities of the company in land
and real estate development and the continued solid investor and
occupier interest in the Beirut central district," the report
added.
</P>
<P>
It showed that the company's cash position at the end of 1997
was 229.9 million dollars, and its accounts and notes receivable
amounted to 214 million dollars at the same time.
</P>
<P>
As the report was issued, the price of Solidere's A share at
the Beirut Stock Exchange rose by daily maximum rate of 5
percent. Shareholders decide to keep their stocks in anticipation
of further surge.

<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts have created the
country's first flotation therapeutic equipment, trying to cure
psychological disorders resulting from various daily pressure.
</P>
<P>
The equipment can help reduce anxiety, depression, fear,
dizziness and insomnia, the experts at Beijing Medical University
said here recently.
</P>
<P>
The flotation therapy -- which is prevalent in Canada, Japan,
the United States and many European countries -- also helps cure
patients suffering from hypertension, diabetes or rheumatoid
arthritis, medical experts said.
</P>
<P>
In the treatment, doctors make patients float on the liquid
with various medicine.
</P>
<P>
People release endorphins, hormones with curative aspects, when
floating, according to scientists.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, doctors can reach their goals of psychological
analysis and hypno-analysis using the flotation therapy.
</P>
<P>
Students and athletes can take advantage of the treatment as
well, the experts said.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Authorities Urged to Cast away Illusion  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Central Committee of the
Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) today
appealed to the Taiwan Authorities to respond earnestly and
positively to President Jiang Zemin's eight-point proposal and
take practical measures to hold political negotiations across the
Taiwan Straits at an earlier date.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of the Ninth National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), Zhou
Tienong, vice-chairman of the RCCK's Central Committee, said the
growth of cross-straits relations and realization of the
motherland' reunification concern the fundamental interests of the
Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
This also represents an inevitable trend of historical
development and the common aspiration of the people across the
Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
How to handling the cross-straits relations well and keep a
correct orientation for Taiwan's future development has become the
key issue that all political parties and political forces in
Taiwan should face squarely, he said.
</P>
<P>
The "One China" principle is a matter which has an bearing on
the state sovereignty and national dignity, and it should be
adhered to unswervingly, he noted. As part of China, the future of
Taiwan hinges on the reunification of the motherland, which is the
common understanding reached by the majority of the Chinese on
both sides of the Taiwan Straits and the international community
as a whole, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, it is regrettable
</P>
<P>
that Taiwan Authorities made many assertions in an attempt to
break away with the framework of one China and fabricate a "basis"
for "splittism and division of rule." Leaders of Taiwan
authorities have gone too far to accept the principle of "One
China", he said.
</P>
<P>
"We hold that the fundamental differences across the Taiwan
Straits hinges on the fact that whether the "One china" principle
is kept to or the scheme of "Two Chinas" or "One China, One
Taiwan" is followed, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
The two opposing political positions are bound to determine the
destiny of the Taiwan people and lead to the entirely different
orientations of development for Taiwan, he added.
</P>
<P>
Neither "Taiwan Inndence" nor "independence of Taiwan" will
have the future, and these schemes will eventually subject Taiwan
to the appendage of foreign forces and throw the Taiwan people in
the abyss of suffering, he said.
</P>
<P>
Only the two sides work hand-in-hand for the reunification of
the motherland, can Taiwan maintain a long-term stability and
prosperity, can the people on both sides enjoy the lasting peace and
the dignity of the motherland, and can the Chinese nation have a
bright future, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expects the people of insightedness within the Kuomintang
give prominence to the national interests and the well-being of
the 21 million Taiwan people, comply with the wishes of Taiwan
people, discard the erroneous stand of "splitt and division of
rule", return to the stance of "One China" and make due
contributions for the direct links of postal, air and shipping
services and trade between the two sides and promote the great
cause of the reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Holding political negotiations across the straits is the key to
the improvement and development of relations between the two
sides. It is both a rational and flexible option to steadily
implement the concept of peaceful reunification through holding
political negotiations, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, political negotiations between the two sides will
also remove obstacles for the business routine and economic talks
across the straits and help break the political deadlock and
promote healthy development of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Finally, on behalf of the of RCCK Central Committee, Zhou urged
the Taiwan Authorities to cast away unrealistic illusions, make an
earnest and positive response to the eight-point proposal put
forward by President Jiang Zemin and his reiteration at the 15th
National Congress of the Communist Party of China and take
concrete measures to hold political talks across the straits.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Automakers Cut Costs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 11 (Xinhua) -- American automakers are
using cost-cutting to drive profits in a period of flattening
sales and limited price increase.
</P>
<P>
General Motors Corp. announced Wednesday it will cut 4 billion
dollars in costs this year, compared with 3.5 billion dollars last
year.
</P>
<P>
Ford Motor Co. has already stated that it wants to slash 1
billion dollars in costs this year, following a trim of 3 billion
dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Chrysler Corp. also wants to cut 1.5 billion dollars in the
one-year period ending this summer.
</P>
<P>
The savings will come from lower materials costs, manufacturing
efficiencies and smaller engineering expenses, said Jim Finn,
spokesman for General Motors.
</P>
<P>
Jack Smith, General Motors' chairman, told a group of analysts
at the company's annual meeting opened in Detroit that
cost-cutting opportunities are "practically limitless."
</P>
<P>
The analysts, however, expect U.S. automakers to cut tens of
thousands of jobs in the coming year by not replacing workers who
retire.

<HEADLINE> Economist Stresses Government Role in Financial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The government plays an important
role in overseeing and regulating the financial system, which is
essential for steady economic growth and stability, a leading
economist said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In his keynote speech before the end of the week-long Asian
Development Forum, Joseph Stiglitz, senior vice president and
chief economist of the World Bank, said that deep, efficient and
robust financial systems are essential for sustainable
development.
</P>
<P>
"But left themselves, financial markets will not become deep,
efficient, or robust," he said.
</P>
<P>
Stiglitz said that the government plays an essential role,
"both in directly overseeing and regulating the financial system
and also in establishing the correct incentives to encourage
prudential and productive behavior."
</P>
<P>
On the role of the financial system in the current East Asian
financial crisis, Stiglitz said that when financial systems are
working well, the result can be strong economic growth.
</P>
<P>
But when financial systems are working badly, the result can be
crises and prolonged periods of slower growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The roots of the crisis are not in government profligacy, but
in private sector decisions that made the economies vulnerable to
a sudden withdrawal of confidence," Stiglitz said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the biggest problems were the mis-allocation of
investment, most notably to speculative real estate, and the risky
form of financing, especially short-term debt on international
markets.
</P>
<P>
The buildup of short-term, unhedged debt left East Asia's
economies vulnerable to a sudden collapse of confidence, he said.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, capital outflows, and with them depreciating
currencies and falling asset prices, exacerbated the strains on
private sector balance sheets and thus proved self-fulfilling,"
the economist said.
</P>
<P>
Stiglitz said that improving the financial system can lead to
higher growth and reduce the likelihood and severity of crises.
</P>
<P>
"In thinking about financial reform, we need to treat
liberalization as a means rather than an end. Instead of pushing
for immediate de-regulation, we should be trying to understand the
important role the government plays in financial markets," he
said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, which was sponsored by the World Bank and
the Asian Development Bank, 350 economists, government officials
and journalists have discussed lessons of the Asian crisis and
Asia's future development strategies.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Import and Export Bank of
China (EximBank) plans to increase loans to exporters by as much
as 60 percent in order to boost 1998 exports.
</P>
<P>
The bank plans to grant total loans of 24.3 billion yuan, said
a bank official, adding that the funds will be mainly used to
finance exports of vessels, complete sets of equipment, and
telecommunications and electronics products.
</P>
<P>
He said EximBank will continue to grant loans to state-owned
enterprises, but will also expand services to cover joint-stock
companies controlled by the state, and collective and
foreign-funded enterprises in which Chinese partners hold
controlling stake.
</P>
<P>
EximBank, founded in 1994 to finance China's exports of high
value-added capital goods, has granted export seller's credits of
well over 40 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
China's export growth has slowed significantly in the first two
months of this year as a result of the ongoing financial crisis in
Southeast Asia and massive currency devaluations in Thailand, the
Philippines, the Republic of Korea and various other Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
China's exports grew by 20.9 percent during 1997, with the
trade surplus hitting a record 40.3 billion US dollars.

<P>
-- The European Conference, launched in London on Thursday by the
chiefs of state and government of the 15 European Union (EU)
countries and their counterparts in the 11 candidate countries for
EU membership, is above all symbolic. Eight years after the fall of
the Berlin Wall, it marks the beginning of the process of

By 2010, the EU will have around 26 members.

on Wednesday all offers by Belgrade by excluding any solution to the
Kosovo crisis but independence. Meanwhile, the Serbian government
excluded providing any form of autonomy to Kosovo and only called on
ethnic Albanians leaders to join dialogue on the questions about the
realization of human rights, which Belgrade said should be held
within the constitutional framework of Serbia.

Le Figaro:

<P>
-- The French Minister of Agriculture and Fishing Louis Le Pensec
presented on Wednesday a draft law aimed at controlling dangerous

<HEADLINE> Consumer Rights Better Protected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Different levels of
administrations for industry and commerce in China dealt with
18,800 cases involving infringement upon consumer rights in 1997,
retrieving losses of about 300 million yuan for consumers.
</P>
<P>
The number of handled cases increased by 25.8 percent over the
previous year, according to Gan Guoping, deputy director of the
State Administration for Industry and Commerce.
</P>
<P>
A national network has been formed to handle consumer
complaints through various channels, Gan said, adding that Beijing
Wednesday opened a special telephone line to receive complaints,
with 150 calls received in the first three hours.
</P>
<P>
In March of last year, the State Administration for Industry
and Commerce issued a series of concrete measures for local
administrations to hear and handle disputes concerning consumers'
rights.
</P>
<P>
Gan said that the awareness of consumer rights has
increased. An investigation targeting city dwellers shows that
more than 70 percent of the consumers basically know about the Law
on Protection of Consumers' Rights.
</P>
<P>
The country's administrations for industry and commerce handled
72,500 cases concerning the manufacturing and marketing of shoddy
and fake products with a total value of 1.71 billion yuan. Also
handled were 2,500 illegal pyramid sale cases.
</P>
<P>
Gan said protecting consumers' rights covers the interests of
more than one billion Chinese, and it is of great significance to
regulating market order and promoting social stability and unity.
</P>
<P>
He vowed to broaden official channels to accept consumer
complaints and give priority to solving hot problems.

<HEADLINE> "One Country, Two Systems" Best Option to Keep Taiwan's Existing System, Life Style: Member </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- A member of the Ninth National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) said here today that the "one country, two
systems" concept is the best way to maintain Taiwan's existing
social and economy systems.
</P>
<P>
This is the best option to guarantee that Taiwan compatriots'
practical and long-term interests will be freed from any harms.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Chonglang, advisor of the Central Committee of the Taiwan
Democratic Self-Government League and vice-president of the
All-China Federation of Taiwan Compatriots, said that "we know
very well what most of the Taiwan compatriots are thinking about
and understand their desire to maintain the trend for increasing
economic and trade ties as well as people-to-people contracts
across the straits.
</P>
<P>
The principle is suitable for the country's realities and is
able to best protect the interests of Taiwan compatriots, he
added.
</P>
<P>
According to the concept of "one country, two systems," the
compatriots of Taiwan can retain their existing social and
economic systems and their style of life after its return to the
motherland, and Taiwan can keep its troops and have
administrative, legislative and judicial powers.
</P>
<P>
The central government will neither send any people to station
there, nor levy any tax from Taiwan, Zeng said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the situation in Hong Kong has been very good and
become still more prosperous after its return to the motherland,
and the flow of international capital into Hong Kong is
increasing. Recently, he added, Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region said that Hong Kong's
economic prospects remains bright.
</P>
<P>
"Sustained economic growth and ongoing reform and opening-up in
the interior areas of the country will enable Hong Kong to have
a still more optimistic future," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome that the Taiwan compatriots to go on following Hong
Kong's development and promote the settlement of the Taiwan
question at an early date by drawing on Hong Kong's successful
experience in implementing "one country, two systems" concept,"
Zeng Chonglang said.

KUNMING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Woman farmer Fu Fengdi's dream to
have her own cattle has come true because of the small
poverty-relief loans adopted in the mountainous areas of Yunnan
Province.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Fu started by raising 40 chicks on a 1,000-yuan loan

poverty. Small poverty-relief loans is the latest tactic to help
the province's impoverished people.

The one-year loan for a maximum of 1,000 yuan is paid directly
to farmers. Last year, Yunnan introduced the loan program in 25
townships. As a result, 100 percent of the farmers receiving loans
improved their lives and paid back the loans.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the province will spend 250 million yuan to expand the
loan program in 73 counties and, in the next three years, another
900 million yuan will be allocated for credit in all 506 poor
townships, Gov. Li Jiating said.

<HEADLINE> E. African Summit to Upgrade Coop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 12 (Xinhua) - Three East African
Cooperation (EAC) states are expected to hold a summit in August
in Arusha to sign an agreement to upgrade their cooperation into
a treaty, sources from the EAC Secretariat said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The treaty will help define in clearer terms the mode and
inclination of cooperation among the three member states,
Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda, in specific areas, they said.
</P>
<P>
The long-expected East African Passports, which grant the
holders free traveling among the three states, will also be
officially launched during the summit, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Members states of the EAC, which will greet its second
birthday on Saturday, are busy studying the draft of the treaty
to be tabled at the Permanent Tripartite Commission, the highest
EAC decision-making body.
</P>
<P>
Jakaya Kikwete, current chairman of the Tripartite Commission,
who is also Tanzanian Foreign Minister, will host a cocktail
party to celebrate the anniversary in Tanzania's northern city of
Arusha which seats the EAC Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The EAC was founded on the basis of the defunct East African
Community which collapsed in 1977 due to reasons including the
divergence of economic policies then pursued by the member
states, the continued perception of disproportionate sharing of
benefits and lack of adequate compensation mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
Since its foundation, the EAC has tried to address the
shortcomings inherent in the past cooperation initiatives.

<HEADLINE> Jilin Earns Nearly $60 Million in Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Jilin Province
cashed in on tourism last year with an increase of 11.7 percent
over 1996, according to local authorities.
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 overseas tourists spent 59.35 million
U.S. dollars during their stays in the province, which is known
for its winter resorts near the Changbai Mountains.
</P>
<P>
The province's tourism agencies promoted special tour packages
from the beginning of last year. The local government invested 250
million yuan (30 million U.S. dollars) into the thriving business.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a tourism center jointly funded by China and the
Republic of Korea was established near the Changbai Mountains.
</P>
<P>
Tourism programs featuring snow sports were also popular.
Jilin, together with three enterprises, is developing a 35
million-yuan snow-and-ice sports center, which is scheduled to
open in August, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the province standardized the profitable business by
adopting a few regulations to improve services which could attract
more outside travelers, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Australia Pioneers New Lifesaving Computer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Australian researchers are using
computer imaging technology to produce three-dimensional images of
the inside of the human body and software systems capable of
making a diagnosis to help doctors save more lives, avoid pain and
discomfort for patients.
</P>
<P>
Major advances in the diagnosis of breast and cervical cancer,
skin cancer, lung disease and other potentially deadly conditions
are on the way thanks to a revolution in the use of computers to
analyze medical images such as X-rays, ultrasound and
computer-aided-test scans, Australia's largest research body the
Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization
(CSIRO) announced here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
CSIRO scientists have already developed a way to make three
dimensional models of a patient's own internal organs, surgeons
can plan the least-invasive form of treatment without first
opening them up.
</P>
<P>
In a national science briefing to some Australian MPs and
journalists Thursday at the Parliament House in Canberra, experts
said they had developed several computer-aided diagnosis systems
capable of telling what is abnormal from the normal in some part
of human body.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Laurie Wilson with CSIRO Telecommunications and Industrial
Physics department, said the research body, in collaboration with
others, had developed some innovative applications which mad use
of computer representations of anatomical knowledge.
</P>
<P>
The first application is a computer-aided diagnosis system
called "an expert assistant" to assist clinicians in their
assessment of chest X-rays.
</P>
<P>
Radiologist Bruce Doust described the system as capable of
identifying the major features of a chest X-ray, performing a
number of measurements, detecting a range of abnormalities and
producing a diagnosis "report" couched in familiar radiological
terminology.
</P>
<P>
He said the system, which is still in an early clinical test,
would improve the speed, accuracy and reliability of screening for
breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
The system would be available 24 hours a day and would never
get tired, Doust said.
</P>
<P>
Victor Skladnev, managing director of Sydney medical technology
firm Polartechnics PL, said his company is developing Skin Polar
Probe, a detecting device for melanoma, the skin cancer for which
Australia has the highest incidence in the world, using image
analysis techniques developed by CSIRO.
</P>
<P>
"The average general practitioner sees only a few melanomas a
year, and identifying them from other skin blemishes is not so
simple. It can mean that up to half of all melanomas are missed,"
said Skladnev.
</P>
<P>
"The Skin Polar Probe should change all that, by giving general
practitioners the ability to diagnose suspected melanomas on the
spot, enabling swift treatment if they are malignant and avoiding
needless surgery if they are not," he said.
</P>
<P>
The company had already developed a "doctor in a box", a
computerized device for detecting cervical cancer, which was due
to undergo trials around the world in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
The device is the first of its kind in the world and would be
mass produced late this year or early next year, he said in an
interview with Xinhua.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Bank Leans Toward Large, Efficient Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- China's largest bank will direct
more of its loans to large, well-performing, state-owned
enterprises to aid the country's economic restructuring effort.
</P>
<P>
The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) will, on the
basis of market situation and state industrial policies, use its
own rating of clients to guide loan extensions and will consider
enterprises rated at A or above as its basic clients, according to
bank president Liu Tinghuan.
</P>
<P>
Priority will be given to large- and medium-size state-owned
enterprises with marketable products, good economic efficiency and
sound credibility; to large joint-stock companies and
overseas-funded firms in which the state participates; and to
medium- and small-size companies with triple-A ratings, the
president said.
</P>
<P>
He said that 80 percent of this year's new loans will be
extended to companies rated A or above, with the number of
companies with ratings of AA or better hitting no less than 40
percent of the loan portfolio.
</P>
<P>
To that end, ICBC will implement a special loan program among
some selected super-large companies and will continue to sign
bank-enterprise lending agreements with the country's 512 key
industrial firms and 300 key commercial businesses, according to
Liu.
</P>
<P>
The bank will, in principle, not increase its lending to
companies rated BB or lower and will instead step up its effort to
recover loans, the president said.
</P>
<P>
China's central bank, the People's Bank of China, has decided
to phase out the credit quota system among state-owned commercial
banks and introduce asset-to-liability management of bank credits
starting this year, a move that gives banks greater autonomy in
making lending decisions.
</P>
<P>
ICBC's yuan-denominated loans this year will be 205 billion
yuan more than last year. Of that amount, 155 billion yuan will be
for working capital loans and 50 billion yuan for investment in
fixed-assets, according to the bank's work plan this year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that ICBC had more than 2.15 trillion yuan in
outstanding deposits and over 1.9 trillion yuan in unpaid loans by
the end of last year.

<HEADLINE> Water Level Surges in Lower Yangtze River Probably Due to El Nino </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Higher-than-normal water levels on
the lower reaches of the Yangtze River during the dry winter
season is being attributed to the "El Nino" phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
Between November and February, water levels on the middle and
lower Yangtze River have been higher than normal because of higher
rainfall totals, said Wang Jun, senior engineer in the weather
forecast department of the Ministry of Water Resources.
</P>
<P>
Rain mainly fell in the areas of Dongting Lake, Boyang Lake in
central China's Hubei and Hunan provinces and Hangzhou, a city in
east China's Zhejiang Province, Wang said. Nanchang Railway
Station in Hubei Province has recorded 369 millimeters of rainfall
since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
The water level of many river sections below Hankou in Hubei
Province rose 2-to-3 meters compared with average heights.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that El Nino, a weather condition affecting
atmospheric and ocean currents, had a wide-ranging impact in
1997. Research by Chinese meteorologists suggests that the dry
season following an El Nino year usually results in
heavier-than-normal rainfall along the middle and lower reaches of
the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The Hankou Hydrologic Station's statistics show that the
January water level on this section of the Yangtze River has
exceeded 17 meters nine times, and that six out of those nine
times followed an El Nino year.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, China is intensifying research on a possible
connection between El Nino and the hydrological situation of the
lower Yangtze River.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Discusses Ways to End Conflicts in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The newly-created Quick Reaction
Team met on Thursday to discuss matters concerning possible
violations of a joint cease-fire agreement between the Philippine
government and the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).
</P>
<P>
The 18-member team is an independent body formed on March 3 by
the government and the MILF to speed up resolution of armed
conflicts between the two sides or between the MILF and former
guerrillas belonging to the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF).
</P>
<P>
The MILF and the MNLF have had several clashes lately in the
southern provinces of Maguindanao and North Cotabato, in which
about a dozen combatants were killed, scores of others injured and
residents displaced in affected villages.
</P>
<P>
Eliseo Mercado, chairman of an independent fact-finding
committee of the government and MILF, was unanimously chosen to
head the team.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Police Director Chief Franco Calida of the Autonomous
Region in Muslim Mindanao said the team had to be formed following
complaints from peace negotiators that the existing fact-finding
group led by Mercado has been "very passive" in resolving the
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Calida, who is also vice chairman for the government side of
the Committee on the Cessation of Hostilities, said the
newly-organized team is assured of a more responsive and swift
action with the help of officials and troops from both warring
camps.
</P>
<P>
The team is composed of six representatives each from the
government, the MILF and the fact-finding committee.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a breakaway faction from the MNLF and now the biggest
Muslim rebel group in the country, refuses to be part of the peace
agreement signed between the government and the MNLF in 1996 and
wants its own peace accord with Manila.

<HEADLINE> Senior Religious Figures Praise Freedom in Religious Belief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Senior religious figures are
unanimous that the religious policy of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) has created a fine environment for religious affairs.
</P>
<P>
These personities, who are also members of the Ninth National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), are attending the ongoing First Session of the
CPPCC Ninth National Committee.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Puchu, chairman of the Buddhist Association of China, said
the all-round, correct implementation of the Party's policy of
freedom in religious belief, booming economy, improved living
standard of the people, social stability and national unity have
all contributed greatly to a fine environment for the development
of religions.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the people of religious circles should in turn
adapt themselves to socialist society and go all out to support the
government to enhance its management of religious affairs so as
to serve China's stability and development.
</P>
<P>
Jin Luxian, vice-chairman of the Chinese Catholic Bishops
College, said that over the past five years, the legitimate rights
and interests of religious circles and normal religious activities
have been well protected. Moreover, he added, the government has
scored tremendous successes in China's economic growth, and this is
favorable to the development of religions in the country.
</P>
<P>
Wan Yaobin, vice-chairman of the Islamic Association of China,
said there are approximately 20 million moslems in China, who are
satisfied with the country's religious policy.
</P>
<P>
Han Wenzao, chairman of the China Christian Council, said that
religion should carry on the tradition of patriotism and
contribute to the country's social progress and development.
</P>
<P>
Min Zhiting, vice-chairman of the China Daoist Association,
said that along with the registration of religious sites to the
government, the legitimate rights and interests of the religious
circles can be protected better still.

<HEADLINE> Kabbah Cuts Cabinet Members by Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Returned President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah has reduced the number of cabinet ministers from 30 to 15
to show his determination for an efficient government, the Daily
Times reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
President Kabbah, who ended his more than nine months of
self-exile in neighboring Guinea Tuesday, has also pledged to run
a broad-based government his time around.
</P>
<P>
To do this effectively, he promised to set up a policy
advisory committee to evaluate and advise him on all policy
matters of governance and monitor the performance of public
offices, parastatals and public corporations.
</P>
<P>
The president called on his people to cooperate with him fully
in order to achieve the set goals of government for the
betterment of the people.
</P>
<P>
The past poor performance of the government functionaries,
such as bureaucracy, and faulty policies are part of the factors
that triggered off the coup in the tiny west African country last
May, forcing Kabbah and his government to flee to Guinea.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Science Enhances Enthusiasm of Hubei Cotton Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The introduction of
worm-resistant seeds and the proliferation of cultivation
technology has greatly enhanced the enthusiasm of cotton farmers
and heralded a good 1998 cotton harvest in north China's Hebei
Province.
</P>
<P>
Hebei, one of China's major cotton producers, has witnessed a
significant decrease in cotton growing areas in recent years due
to the rising cost of fertilizers and pesticides, and the failure
to control rampant worm infestations.
</P>
<P>
The province planted cotton on a mere 377,100 ha in 1997, a
substantial decrease on the historic high of well over 600,000
hectares.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government initiated a program to reverse the
situation by introducing new breeds of cotton seeds which offer
greater resistance to worms and higher per unit output. In
addition, the program can effectively reduce production costs by
between 750-1200 yuan per hectare.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted by the provincial statistical bureau
revealed that this year's area planted to cotton will approach
424,000 hectares.

<HEADLINE> North China Province Invests Heavily on Key Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, March 12 (Xinhua) -- North China's Shanxi Province,
the country's largest coal base, has injected 10.4 billion yuan
(1.25 billion US dollars) into 23 key projects in the past year.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said that construction of these projects has
been going on smoothly. They include a multi-billion
water-diversion project, a railway line, power plants and
expressways.
</P>
<P>
The Wanjiazhai water-diversion project, called "life project"
for Shanxi, is designed to channel water from the upper reaches of
the Yellow River to coal-rich Shanxi, which often suffers from a
severe shortage of water, through a system of tunnels, aqueduct
pipelines and reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
The whole project will cost 20 billion yuan (about 2.41 billion
US dollars), of which the World Bank will provide 400 million US
dollars in the form of loans.
</P>
<P>
Scheduled for completion in 2001, the project will begin
generating electricity at the end of this year following the
completion of a main dam.
</P>
<P>
Another key project under construction is the Yangcheng Pithead
Power Plant, the world's biggest with a total investment of 13.2
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The plant, with six 350,000-kilowatt generating units, will
have an installed capacity of 2.1 million kw. With power produced
there transmitted to energy-thirsty Jiangsu Province in east China
via a 755-km 500-kilovolt line, the plant will be able to provide
more than 10 billion kwh of electricity a year.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Zhangze Power Plant is now under expansion with
installation of two 300,000-kw generating units for "transporting
electricity" to east China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate the coal transportation out of Shanxi, the 252-km
railway line between Houma in Shanxi and Yueshan in Henan Province
was put into trial operation in 1997. And Jincheng-Yangcheng
Expressway was also completed last year for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
Another 94-km-long expressway linking Yuanping City and
Taiyuan, the provincial capital, is being built with a total
investment of 2.6 billion yuan. It will be completed in October
this year.

<HEADLINE> 3 Israeli Soldiers Responsible for Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The three Israeli soldiers who
killed three Palestinian workers and sparked widespread rioting in
the territories were released Thursday under the order of Army's
Central Commander Uzi Dayan.
</P>
<P>
The release came despite Dayan's public statement that the
initial investigation showed that the Palestinian driver, killed
together with two other Palestinian workers Tuesday evening, was
not intending to launch a terror attack but only trying to cut
into the line at the Tarkumiya roadblock near Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Outraged Palestinians staged widespread clashes with Israeli
soldiers in the West Bank following the killing. Dozens of
protesters were injured Wednesday in clashes with Israeli soldiers
in several places.
</P>
<P>
This was the worst violence in months between the Israelis and
Palestinians, signaling the simmering tensions due to the
prolonged deadlock in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
By releasing the three soldiers, Israeli Army apparently
defended the soldiers' action in opening fire at the van which
was said to have tried to run over the roadblock and injured an
Israeli soldier. The Army's orders give soldiers who suspected
terror attacks the right to open fire, though they are required to
fire warning shots first.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Army promised to continue the investigation and to
inform the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) of all details.
</P>
<P>
In another step to calm the situation, Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai telephoned PNA's deputy head Mahmoud
Abbas (Abu Mazen) Wednesday night to express sorrow over the
killing. Mordechai updated Abbas his visit late Wednesday to the
Tarkumiya roadblock and called on the PNA to help calm the
tensions.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday night, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu telephoned PNA President Yasser Arafat to offer
condolences to the families of the victims.
</P>
<P>
Speaking late Wednesday while meeting visiting Albanian Prime
Minister Fatos Nano, Netanyahu again called for restoring calm
and warned the PNA against exploiting the incident for political
gains. Commenting on the call on him to pay a condolence visit to
the victim families, Netanyahu only said the security
establishment was checking the possibility.

<HEADLINE> Military Wind Tunnel Benefits Civilian Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese military scientists at a
wind tunnel test base have begun providing more service for the
country's civilian projects.
</P>
<P>
The base is attached to the Commission of Science, Technology
and Industry for National Defense. It formerly was used solely for
China's development of satellites, guided missiles, aircraft and
other national defence projects.
</P>
<P>
However, in support of the country's economic development, the
base is now being used for special wind tunnel tests for such
things as the design of new locomotives. As a result of the
locomotive tests, the front part of the cab was redesigned to
reduce wind resistance. The research played a decisive role in
increasing train speed in the country last year.
</P>
<P>
The base also ran wind tunnel tests for a medium-size truck
developed by central China's Hubei Province. After altering the
design, the air-power resistance coefficient and oil consumption
volume of the truck decreased.
</P>
<P>
The base also has performed wind tunnel tests for such civilian
projects as Asia's highest television tower in Shanghai, an
extension project for Capital International Airport in Beijing and
the Haicang Bridge connecting Haicang with Xiamen Island.

<P>
SHANGHAI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's ambitious plan to
clean up its environment by 2000 has opened a broad arena for
foreign investors, according to the city's Economic Commission.
</P>
<P>
An Economic Commission official said Shanghai from 1996 to
2000 will invest 70 billion yuan in environmental protection,
which include tree planting, wastewater and garbage treatment,
drinking water supply, gas projects as well as the cleaning up of
the Suzhou River.
</P>
<P>
The investment earmarked for environmental protection is the
biggest among all the Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
Experts at the ongoing "China-Europe Symposium on Environmental
Technology" predict that foreign investors can compete for about
10 billion yuan worth of deals.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the world's major companies related to
environmental protection have stationed themselves in Shanghai, in

<HEADLINE> Government Advisors on Rule of Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Several members of the Ninth
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), the top advisory body, today underlined the
importance of instituting the practice of a rule by law across the
country.
</P>
<P>
At a speech meeting of the ongoing First Session of the Ninth
CPPCC National Committee here today, the advisors noted that
everything in China, including its political life, economic
growth, social progress and the people's everyday life, should be
administered and managed according to law instead of being
subjected to anyone's personal will.
</P>
<P>
Member Zhang Baowen and Member Huang Jingjun, both senior
leaders of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League,
one of China's eight non-Communist parties, made a joint speech on
rule of law.
</P>
<P>
"In his report to the 15th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China (CPC), Jiang Zemin had proclaimed for the first
time that 'administering the country according to law and building
a socialist nation ruled by law' is a basic strategy for the CPC
in leading the Chinese people in the management of the country,"
they noted.
</P>
<P>
This constitutes a major theoretical breakthrough and a
fundamental change in the way China is being managed, they
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
In order to promote a rule of law in China nowadays, they
suggested that greater efforts be made to improve the socialist
legal system, establish a clean and efficient law enforcement
system and a fair judicial system, develop a system of democratic
supervision and enhance the legal awareness of all the people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, member Mei Yangzheng, chairman of the Henan
Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese
Kuomintang, another non-Communist party in China, described a rule
of law as a cornerstone of the country's development.
</P>
<P>
The administering of the country according to law comprises
four major factors, namely, legislation, spread of legal
knowledge, law enforcement and the CPC leadership and supervision
over it, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that improved leadership and supervision are the
basic guarantee for the successful establishment of a rule of law.
</P>
<P>
"Only by strengthening the leadership of the CPC and through
the development of a supervisory system that includes the Party,
people's congresses and the government, can we achieve the maximum
and best efficiency in the promotion of a rule of law," Lu said.

<HEADLINE> Malaria Epidemic Contained in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Regional health offices have
contained a malaria epidemic in a southern Philippine island, the
Philippine News Agency reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Mustala Hairon, regional secretary of the
Department of Health in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao,
as saying that his office had delivered sufficient anti-malaria
services and undertaken other health measures in Laminusa Island,
Sulu province.
</P>
<P>
"With all the help that is pouring into Laminusa and all the
efforts given, the epidemic is contained...It is now under
control," the health official declared.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that 138 people in Laminusa had died from
the malaria epidemic since the disease broke out in February.
</P>
<P>
Hairon said as an added control measure, 301 children in
Laminusa were immunized for measles. Children from neighboring
islands were also recommended for immunization.
</P>
<P>
Hairon, together with the autonomous region Governor Nur
Misuari and other local officials assessed the over-all health
situation in the affected island on March 5.
</P>
<P>
Misuari expressed sympathy with the relatives of those who died
as he distributed relief goods and recommended the setting up of a
potable water system, Hairon said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report said, health officials in nearby
Tawi-Tawi city have put up a "red alert" around the island to
avert any possible occurrence of the dreaded disease.

<HEADLINE> Property Market Recovering from Slump in Beihai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Property business in the
beach-side city of Beihai continued to pick up this year following
recovery from slumps in previous years.
</P>
<P>
In January, property transactions in this city in Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region reached 150 million yuan (18.072 million
U.S. dollars), a year-on-year increase of 93.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
One of the first coastal cities opened to overseas investment,
Beihai on the Beibu Gulf was once a focal point for property
developers from across the country. However, the market plummeted
around 1995 due to the state's tightening-the-belt policy.
</P>
<P>
The market picked up again in May of 1996 when the local
government adopted new land policies resulting in huge cuts in
government profits. In 1997, transactions rose by 15 percent over
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
According to market sources, the conveniently located
residential apartments managed by high-quality property management
companies are selling especially well, while offices and villas
are still lacking demand.

Communist Party of China, the battle against corruption, and
Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
A majority of the respondents said that what they most want to
say is: "May the motherland be prosperous" and the "21st century
belongs to China.".
</P>
<P>
Ninety-three percent of those surveyed agreed that the central
government had done a good job in deepening reform, expanding
opening-up and speeding up economic development, as well as in the
development of foreign relations and promotion of the
reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Another 70 percent of the respondents said that the central
government extended effective efforts in developing science and
education and controlling inflation and stablizing prices.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 97 percent of the respondents said the
political situation in the country is quite stable or
comparatively stable.
</P>

<HEADLINE> New Offshore Oil Field Found in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Angola National Petroleum
Corporation said a new deep-water oil field was discovered by Elf
Exploration Angola, an affiliate of the Elf Petroleum Corporation
of France, which is tapping oil in the Angolan waters.
</P>
<P>
A release issued by the Angola National Petroleum Corporation
said that Elf Exploration Angola discovered an oil field with
large reserves and high-quality oil in Rosa-1 Well 1,405 meters
under sea level, over 200 km northwest of the capital Luanda.
</P>
<P>
During the trial production, the well produces 12,000 barrels
daily. It is revealed that Elf will carry out follow-up
exploration to confirm its actual reserves.
</P>
<P>
The new oil field is the third one found in the No. 17 waters
by Elf Corporation. The other two have reportedly 1,400 million
barrels' oil reserve altogether.
</P>
<P>
Elf Corporation Angola has been operating in the southern
African country for many years. Its discoveries have nearly
doubled Angola's oil reserve and made the country the second
largest oil-producer in the sub-Sahara Africa, next only to
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
At present, oil has become the main economic pillar in Angola,
with its daily output increased from 600,000 barrels two years
ago to the current 750,000 barrels.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Angola's oil production will reach one
million barrels in the beginning of next century.

<HEADLINE> China's Securities Market Witnesses Sound Development (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- China's securities market remains
basically stable and continues to exhibit good prospects for
further growth, according to Zhou Zhengqing, chairman of the China
Securities Regulatory Committee (CSRC).
</P>
<P>
Today's People's Daily quoted Zhou, who serves as deputy
secretary-general of the State Council, as saying that "the
development of China's stock markets remains generally stable,
despite recent fluctuations." Even though the market appears
somewhat bearish when considering previous periods of overheating,
the trend is basically normal when compared to the sluggish market
witnessed in previous years.
</P>
<P>
Stock indices at the end of 1997 showed growth of 30 percent on
a year-on-year basis.
</P>
<P>
Zhou, a deputy to the Ninth National People's Congress, said
his confidence in China's stock markets is based on four factors:
</P>
<P>
Firstly, the national economy will continue to maintain good
growth momentum, with the government pledging to 1998 measures to
ensure an eight percent growth rate for this year.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, deepening the reform of state-owned enterprises
(SOEs) and implementing the reemployment project will greatly
improve the production and efficiency of related enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, total savings deposits of Chinese citizens stood at a
record 4,600 billion yuan (554.21 billion US dollars) at the end
of 1997. Savings will further promote the desire to invest in
securities, and will in turn create favorable conditions for
expanding sources for financing.

<P>
Finally, the program to enhance investor awareness of stock
risks launched at the end of 1996, and the market order
rectification campaign introduced last year have helped to
effectively curb excessive speculation and maintain market order.
</P>
<P>
"The aforementioned factors have been conducive to improving
the efficiency of listed companies and ensuring steady development
of the stock market," said Zhou, who serves concurrently as
director of the State Council's China Securities Commission.
</P>
<P>
Zhou responsed to a question concerning whether listing medium-
and large-sized SOEs will affect investor confidences by pointing
out that "such worries are unnecessary."
</P>
<P>
He noted that China's stock market is in the preliminary stage
of development, and stressed that nurturing market demand will
require a long process since the conditions for large-scale market
expansion are currently inadequate. However, this in no way rules
out market expansion, a prerequisite for development.
</P>
<P>
Each of the world's five largest stock exchanges enjoys market
capitalization in excess of 2,000 billion US dollars, compared to
slightly over 200 billion US dollars for China's exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Stock market capitalization in developed countries usually
accounts for some 80 percent of the GDP, while the figure for
China stands at only 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Meeting the needs of economic reform and development requires
that we enlarge the stock market in line with market demand, with
related actions carried out in an appropriate manner and at the
proper time," said Zhou.

<P>
However, the process of listing large SOEs requires full
consideration of the capacity and endurance of the market, and
stress will be placed on strict examinations of the quality of
listed companies, according to Zhou.
</P>
<P>
He sternly rebuked the belief that "market development is more
important than market standardization," and called the belief
"totally incorrect."
</P>
<P>
Zhou pointed out that the stock market in the United States
gradually embarked on a road of stable development after
strengthening market regulation in the wake of market slumps in
1929.
</P>
<P>
The steady growth of China's stock markets will require the
firm implementation of the principles stressing legislation,
supervision, self-discipline, and standardization.
</P>
<P>
"The blind pursuit of market expansion while neglecting
standardization will encourage excessive speculation and hinder
healthy market development," according to Zhou.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that China will focus future work on the following
five major aspects:
</P>
<P>
Firstly, deepening reform of the securities supervision system
with a goal towards establishing unified and highly-efficient
securities supervision mechanisms. As part of the effort,
functions related to supervising securities firms will be
transferred from the People's Bank of China, the nation's central
bank, to the CSRC, and central and local government supervising
powers over securities will be centralized.

Secondly, tightening supervision and further rectifying and
standardizing market order.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, exerting every possible effort to improve the quality
of listed companies, including strengthening examination and
approval procedures, optimizing structures and strengthening
regulation.
</P>
<P>
Fourthly, accelerating market legislation efforts,
including formulation of the "Securities Law."
</P>
<P>
Finally, actively experimenting with the establishment of a
securities investment fund.
</P>
<P>
Zhou announced that the first round of securities investment
funds will be issued to the public in the near future.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out 101 listed companies were issuing B shares to
overseas investors by the end of February, with the total amount
of capital raised from related issues reaching 4.5 billion US
dollars. Zhou also pointed the that the B share market is expected
to witness further development.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 42 inland Chinese companies had raised a total of
9.7 billion US dollars on overseas stock markets by the end of
last month, including 40 companies listing H shares in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Recent years have also witnessed the rapid growth of red chip
stocks issued by companies registered in Hong Kong with inland
backing. For example China Telecom (HK), a major red chip company,
raised 4.2 billion US dollars and became the fourth largest listed
firm on the Hong Kong Market.
</P>
<P>
Last June, the State Council issued a circular designed to
standardize the activities of inland investors holding red chip
stocks and curb the rush for related listings.
</P>
<P>
"The CSRC will continue to encourage the standardized
development of red chip companies in accordance with the
circular", said Zhou.

a press conference here today that he has every confidence in the
up-coming election of the Legislative Council in the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR), which will be conducted in a
fair, just and open manner.
</P>
<P>
In response to questions at the press conference, Qian said the

in Hong Kong. The method for the election has been formulated by
the Hong Kong SAR government, the election will be organized and
run by the SAR government, and all the preparations are underway.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the central government does not have any plan
to send any people there to monitor the election.
</P>
<P>
The deputies to the National People's Congress and members of
the CPPCC National Committee from the HKSAR have come to Beijing,

<HEADLINE> Philippine Non-Bank Financial Bodies Outnumber Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Non-bank financial institutions
have outnumbered banks as they account for 58.6 percent of the
total operating network in the country, the Central Bank of the
Philippines said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In its 1997 third quarter report to President Fidel Ramos, the
central bank noted that during the quarter, the number of
financial institutions totaled 16,316 as of the end of September
1997.
</P>
<P>
Of this number, the non-bank institutions, comprising lending
investors and pawnshops, totaled 9,569 units.
</P>
<P>
During the period, banks grew from 6,569 in March 1997 to 6,747
in September 1997, compared with only 6,045 on September 19, 1996,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said the increase in the number of banks
improved the population-to-banks ratio from 11,442 at the end of
1996 to 10,925 as of June 1997.
</P>
<P>
More efficient financial intermediation carried out by banks
and non-banks contributed to the improvement in the ratio of
domestic liquidity which rose to 39.7 percent as of the third
quarter of 1997 from 38.2 percent in the last quarter of 1996, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank also expressed optimism that the assets of
commercial banks remained adequate to cover risk assets, saying
the risk asset ratio of these banks at 16.5 percent as of the
third quarter was higher than the 10 percent statutory
requirement.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the central bank proposed to the Monetary Board to
strengthen banking regulations as concerns of a financial crisis
like that in Thailand could prevail in the Philippine market.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Members Enhance Cooperation in Cement Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from six ASEAN
members met here Thursday to seek ways of promoting cooperation in
the cement field.
</P>
<P>
At a three-day symposium, the representatives reached an
agreement that gives priority to member countries to purchase
cement from fellow members that have excess production capacity.
</P>
<P>
A regional surplus of 35 million tons of cement is forecast
this year as the recession will cut demand by about 10 percent
from last year's level of 112 million tons, according to the
participants.
</P>
<P>
The symposium was organized by the ASEAN Federation of Cement
Manufacturers which groups Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Federation President Tawee Butsunton said total production
capacity of the six countries this year would be about 163 million
tons while demand is projected at 100 million tons.
</P>
<P>
"Evidently, total production capacity in 1998 will exceed
demand and therefore cement manufacturers in Thailand, Indonesia,
Malaysia and the Philippines are looking for export markets," he
said.
</P>
<P>
This year Thailand will need to offload 8 million to 10 million
tons of cement in export markets while Indonesia is expected to
export 4.5 million tons and the Philippines 5.2 million tons, said
Tawee, who is also executive vice-president of Thailand's Siam
Cement plc.
</P>
<P>
Federation members that need to import cement and clinker are
Vietnam, Singapore and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's cement consumption last year, hit by the economic
downturn, dropped by 4 percent from the previous year to 36
million tons. There were no clinker or cement imports due to the
domestic oversupply.
</P>
<P>
The country exported 1.2 million tons of cement and 4.3 million
tons of clinker last year.
</P>
<P>
Tawee said that due to the slump in the construction industry,
the country's cement demand is expected to be 26.6 million tons,
26 percent lower than in 1997. Production capacity has been
forecast at 50 million tons.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Army Retrenchment Program Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA)
is still reducing its size in an internal army exercise
complementing the wider retrenchment program that has already
seen the army reduced from 51,000 to 35,000 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The Herald daily reported Thursday that the reduction is meant
to cut the army's annual budget while the retrenchment exercise
seeks to streamline general government expenditure in line with
economic demands.
</P>
<P>
Job Whabira, Zimbabwean Secretary for Defense, told the paper
Wednesday that the down-sizing was dictated by needs that arose
in the army particularly during peace time. But the army still
had to recruit soldiers to replace those who retired or died.
</P>
<P>
"Forty thousand soldiers is the army establishment that we
could maintain if we had the money. But because of economic
constraints we had to make our own internal arrangements to
down-size the army and create some savings," the secretary said,
adding that "The savings are very nominal but good enough."
</P>
<P>
The army streamlined its forces to focus more on training and
upgrading of equipment, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Most of the equipment including vehicles were inherited from
the Rhodesian army and was "dilapidated," said Whabira, who
confirmed the purchase of new equipment but would not disclose
it.
</P>
<P>
"Wait, we will display the equipment on Defense Forces Day,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary for Defense dismissed as untrue reports that the
army was facing serious food shortages at some barracks which had
forced the ZNA to send soldiers home occasionally.

GUANGZHOU, March 12 (Xinhua) -- If a foreign investor has a
project in mind in Guangzhou, he gets invited to the second floor
of the new wing of the Dongfang Hotel.
</P>
<P>
There he can find 63 "windows" offering all the services he
needs to start his business: foreign trade, taxation, banking,
accounting, legal affairs and public security to mention only a
few.
</P>
<P>
Because of the convenient and expeditious services it offers to
foreign investors, the "General Office for Foreign Economic
Relations and Trade," founded in 1985, has become a national model
of the foreign economic relations and trade departments.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 alone the "office" received more than 80,000 overseas
investors, handled more than 60,000 investment and business cases,
dealt with more than 30 complaints and collected 250 million yuan
(30.12 million U.S. dollars) in fees on an acting basis.
</P>
<P>
The office also serves as a bridge between local companies and
foreign investors by launching conferences and organizing
inspection tours.
</P>
<P>
To avoid occurrence of random charges on overseas-funded
companies, the office was authorized by the Guangzhou municipal
government in 1995 to collect fees with unified standards and an

MANILA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Japan will fund 31 million pesos
(775,000 U.S. dollars) for a five-year reforestation project on a
2,176-hectare area in the Philippines' Clark Special Economic
Zone.
</P>
<P>
The Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan has approved
the funding, the Philippine News Agency Thursday quoted Romeo
David, president of the Clark Development Corporation, as saying.
</P>
<P>
David said the reforestation project is a joint effort of his
corporation and the Department of Environment and Natural
Resources to combat the possibility of inadequate water supply in
the future in the 4,400-hectare main Clark area.
</P>
<P>
The two parties recently signed a memorandum of understanding
to undertake long-term integrated environmental solutions, among
which is the establishment of a water shed and a reforestation
area in the Clark sub-zone.
</P>
<P>
The Clark watershed project was designed to rehabilitate the
areas' capacity for hydrological balance by planting some 2.5
million hardwood and fruit-bearing trees with the involvement of
local residents.
</P>
<P>
The watershed project in its full blown stage will help in
preventing soil erosion and excessive flooding and revitalizing
the holding capacity of underground water, David explained.

the Business Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This year's figure brings IFC's total investment portfolio for
the past 15 years to about 2.4 billion Zimbabwean Dollars (141
million U.S. Dollars). Investment has been made in the
manufacturing, horticulture and pharmaceutical sectors, among
others, he said.
</P>
<P>
Condon said IFC's financial commitment to Zimbabwe represented
about 11 percent of the total sub-Saharan investment.
</P>
<P>
IFC offered financial assistance through loan disbursements
and equity investments in some cases. The assistance was given
only to private sector projects that were financially viable and
export-oriented.
</P>
<P>
Condon was optimistic that in the next fiscal year more
resources would be allocated to Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, "The current situation makes it difficult
for us to plan ahead because we are not sure of what the future
holds."

<HEADLINE> New Evidence Found at Site of Nanjing Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- An antitank grenade, a bayonet, a
military knife and 300 rounds of ammunition believed used by
Japanese troops during the Nanjing Massacre were unearthed in
mid-February at a building site near the Zhongshan Wharf of
Nanjing City in east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, helmets, bronze collar-badges, enamel bowls
and some other daily goods used by Chinese soldiers more than 60
years ago have also been found.
</P>
<P>
Experts here believe that the newly discovered articles
coincide with historical records of the Nanjing Massacre.
</P>
<P>
Starting from Dec. 13, 1937, the Japanese invaders began a
six-week massacre of 300,000 civilians and disarmed Chinese
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that during the massacre Japanese troops killed
more than 9,000 Chinese citizens at the Zhongshan Wharf along the
Yangtze River with machine guns and threw the dead bodies into the
river on Dec. 16 and 18 of 1937.
</P>
<P>
Photos of massacre scenes at the wharf taken by a photographer
for the Japanese troops also document the slaughter.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yongxing, 85 years old and a survivor of the Nanjing
Massacre, said that 60 years ago his younger brother was killed by
Japanese soldiers and that he had a narrow escape by jumping into
the river. He said the newly discovered Japanese bayonet and
ammunition are strong evidence of the Nanjing Massacre.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia deplores the recent
outbreak of violence in Kosovo and urges Serb authorities to act
immediately to defuse the crisis, Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad
Badawi said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has been following the situation closely and is
disappointed that there is no sign of a respite, the minister said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the Serb authorities will take heed of the concerns of
the international community and act immediately to defuse the
crisis," Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
He urged Serb authorities to exercise utmost restraint and
initiate a dialogue with the people of Kosovo, which is dominated
by ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
He said it is only appropriate that autonomy be restored to the
region in Yugoslavia to help bring back peace there.
</P>
<P>
"Failure on the part of the Serb authorities to take decisive
action to introduce a degree of reassurance for the people of
Kosovo would only prolong the crisis," Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
He said this could also affect other neighboring countries and
widen the conflict.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Predicts Slower Export Growth in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's export growth in the
first quarter is projected at 14 percent, well below last year's
20 percent growth during the same period, the ministry of trade
was quoted as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The average monthly exports in the first quarter amounted to
745 million U.S. dollars, well short of the state target of 910
million dollars to gross a targeted 11 billion dollars exports for
the whole year of 1998, reported "Vietnam News" by quoting trade
officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the export slump mainly to fierce price
competition among main export commodities including rice, rubber,
textiles, garments, footwear and marine products.
</P>
<P>
The ministry predicted sharp drop in rubber and coffee exports
during the first quarter, with rubber exports reaching 36,000
tons, a 24 percent year-on-year drop, and coffee exports reaching
110,000 tons, a 37.3 percent drop over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil and cashew nuts have also posted drops in export
value against 1997 figure. Although the volume of pumped oil
increased by 18.6 percent in the first two months, export value
fell by 80 million dollars against the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil prices dropped by 50 dollars per ton while cashew nut
prices fell by 60 to 70 dollars per ton.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that the regional financial crisis has
affected Vietnam's exports. Its exports to regional countries
account for 25 to 30 percent of its total export value.

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputies Hail Progress in Law-making, Supervision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Deputies to the First Session of
the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), now well under way
here, said China has scored remarkable progress in legislation,
law-enforcement and supervision, but there still exist some
problems.
</P>
<P>
Amudun Niyaz, a deputy from the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region, said that building of a socialist country ruled by law is
a major strategy set by the 15th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China, and that long-term, arduous efforts are
required to achieve the goal.
</P>
<P>
However, he acknowledged that the pressing problems for the
time being remain the failure to abide by the law, and put an end
to laxity law-enforcement and weak supervision.
</P>
<P>
To speed up the pace for legislation, more new laws should be
enacted and some exiting laws have to be revised so as to further
improve the legal system and a mechanism should be established to
standardize supervision procedures and strengthen supervision
effectiveness, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, deputy Dai Mingzi said that the Eighth NPC enacted
the largest number of laws during the past five years as compared
with any previous period. The NPC has also scored the greatest
progress in its self-development during this five-year period.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, over the past five years, the role of the supreme
organ of state power have been brought into still better play, and
the public have become increasingly aware of the irreplaceable
role of such functions, he said.
</P>
<P>
NPC deputy Wang Tong proposed that the pace for the making of
laws concerning reform and economic development should be
accelerated, but underlined the laws' publicization and
implementation, which are more important.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Helps Philippines Strengthen Safety Nets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank is helping the
Philippines strengthen its social safety nets to mitigate the
adverse effects of the present currency crisis, particularly on
employment, the Philippine News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Strengthening the social safety nets would need a priority
now. We have social assessment to determine the immediate needs,"
the report quoted Khalilzadeh Shirazi, World Bank regional manager
for strategy and partnerships of East Asia and the Pacific, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Shirazi said the Philippines may be less affected by the Asian
crisis but the magnitude of the crisis and the sharp drop in
growth rates of many countries made it necessary to have these
measures.
</P>
<P>
"It (the Philippines) is doing very well in coping with the
crisis. What will eventually happen depends on the regional
environment so everything is not within control of the
Philippines," he said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank is currently working with the Philippines,
Thailand and Indonesia for this undertaking to help them cope with
the social impact of the crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vinay Bhargava, World Bank country director for the
Philippines, said the bank is readying its 90-million-U.S.-dollar
assistance aimed at increasing incomes of the poor and providing
basic services.
</P>
<P>
This is part of a 1-billion-dollar special loan package the
bank committed for the Philippines last month, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said it is necessary to help troubled economies due to the
worsening impact of the crisis on employment, inflation and
budget.
</P>
<P>
"It was agreed that 1998 (employment) trend in the Philippines
may be the worst. Expect some rise in the unemployment in the near
future because the growth rate will slow down by about half," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Cielito Habito said
that as of last month, the Philippine Department of Labor and
Employment had received 431 notices of layoffs affecting more than
19,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
The actual number may more than double considering unregistered
cases. The jobs of thousands of Filipino workers in countries like
Malaysia and South Korea are "likewise imperiled," he said.
</P>
<P>
Habito added that the crisis has also severely affected
services, education, housing programs and social welfare services.

BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- A rare bird only known through
photographs has been spotted in Wuyuan County in east China's
Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The "garrulax galbanus," slightly larger than the babbler,
lives only in the evergreen broad-leaf forests in Lianxi and
Meilin villages in Wuyuan County. There used to its records in
southwest China's Yunnan Province and neighboring Burma.

<P>
Experts with the National Environmental Protection Agency said

still no systematic knowledge of the bird's habits and
characteristics," said an expert.
</P>
<P>
The birds discovered this time were in four groups with the
total number estimated at 30. The investigating group that spotted
the garrulax galbanus recorded the birds' chirping, which
reportedly is unique and beautiful.
</P>
<P>
The group discovered the birds during an investigation in the
Wuyuan County Nature Reserve. It is now conducting further studies
to gain a better knowledge of the number, distribution and habits
of the bird in the reserve.

CHENGDU, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Farmers' per-capita income in
southwest China's Sichuan Province reached a record 1,595
yuan in real terms in 1997, up 9.3 percent on 1996.

A recent sample survey shows that 23.4 percent of the rural

</P>
<P>
The farmers earned 1,081 yuan from industry, 276 yuan from
agriculture, and 223 yuan from the service sector.
</P>
<P>
Economists attribute the increase mainly to the strict control
over prices, with the price index of farmers' living expenses
below 6 percent while that of the means of production less than
one percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the province intensified its efforts to help poor
farmers in northern and western Sichuan, and has considerably

He said the banks maintained that there was an opportunity for
Thailand to raise money in the international capital markets, and
foreign institutional investors will have an appetite for the Thai
sovereign bond since it will offer attractive returns in view of

<HEADLINE> Semiconductor Capital Spending to Drop Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Semiconductor capital
spending will drop by 12-14 percent worldwide in 1998 compared
with that of last year, according to a report from an American
investment analyst company.
</P>
<P>
The drop is attributed to steeper-than-expected cuts in Japan,
Morgan Stanley &AMP; Co. said in a newly revised forecast before its
Semiconductor Equipment Conference in California.
</P>
<P>
The company had previously predicted a 7 to 10 percent decline
in spending on semiconductor production systems.
</P>
<P>
Reduced capital spending budgets by Japanese chip makers was
blamed for the downgraded outlook. The report said that the
spending in Japan will decline by 14 percent from that of last
year, based on yen value.
</P>
<P>
The company also believed that Motorola will cut its capital
investment in semiconductor from its originally estimated 2.5
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Other North American-based chip makers will likely trim this
year's capital spending plans, the report added.
</P>
<P>
"Nonetheless, we expect North American capital spending to
still be up 10 percent, although this could slip to a mid-single
digit increase," the report said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Publish Updated Code of Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will soon have an
updated code of laws to meet the needs of courts, lawyers and
others concerned, the national news agency BSS reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A bill to this effect would be introduced to the current
session of the Jatiya Sangsad (parliament) for the passage of the
Bangladesh Code, the news agency quoted sources at the Ministry of
Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A draft bill in this regard has been prepared to be submitted
to the next cabinet meeting for approval.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh Code is designed to present in handy volumes the
amended, adapted and authentic versions of all enacted laws in
force in the country, to ascertain the current status of the
existing laws which have undergone extensive changes and to keep
track of the flow of new laws being enacted.
</P>
<P>
The task of preparing the Bangladesh Code was initiated soon
after the country gained independence in 1971 and a cell was
formed in 1972.
</P>
<P>
The cell examined a total of 373 laws inherited from the past
dating from 1836 to 1947. Of the laws, 93 were repealed, 17
declared non-Bangladesh and the remaining 263 proposed for
amendments.
</P>
<P>
A program was undertaken to publish the Bangladesh Code in 12
volumes in the early years of independence, but only one volume
was awaiting publication, leaving the country without a complete
code of laws for over two decades.
</P>
<P>
The present government revived the program and a three-member
committee has been formed to make recommendations in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The committee has submitted its recommendations to the
government after examining the country's laws in the period from
1948 to 1957 in the first phase, and in the second phase, it will
examine the laws from 1957 to 1971, the news agency said.

<HEADLINE> New Houses to be Ready for Quake Victims By September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, March 12 (Xinhua) -- All the homeless quake
victims in Zhangjiakou Prefecture in northern Hebei Province
should be able to move into new houses by the end of September,
local officials told Xinhua recently.
</P>
<P>
By then, the 44,000 collapsed houses should be rebuilt and
nearly 70,000 damaged houses repaired, they said.
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 10, Zhangbei and Shangyi counties in the prefecture
were devastated by an earthquake measuring 6.2 on the Richter
scale, which left 47 dead and more than 1,000 seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
Local people have been braving sub-zero temperatures to survive
and rebuild their homes with financial and physical assistance
from the government, the army, and people from other parts of the
country and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Nobody has died or been injured from the cold weather in the
area which is on the brink of the Mongolian Plateau.
</P>
<P>
Currently, local governments of all levels have worked out
preferential policies in building houses and supplying materials.
Local architects involved in designing the new houses for the
victims said that they would bring earthquake safety and frigid
temperatures into consideration.

<HEADLINE> China's Poverty Alleviation Goal Attainable: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official in
charge of poverty alleviation today expressed his confidence that
China can accomplish its goal of basically eliminating poverty by
the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
Yang Yongzhe, deputy chief of the State council's leading group
for eradicating poverty, said his confidence is backed up by
concerted efforts of the central and local governments in recent
years and the increased state funding for this end.
</P>
<P>
China helped lift seven million needy people out of poverty in
1996 and another eight million in 1997. It has also earmarked an
additional 3 billion yuan (361 million US dollars) in loans and
1.5 billion yuan from (181 million US dollars) from the central
budget to support the poverty relieving endeavor since 1996.
</P>
<P>
In his government report to the ongoing First Session of the
Ninth NPC, Premier Li Peng announced that his country will help
another 10 million needy rural people to have adequate food and
clothing this year.
</P>
<P>
"If we can eliminate poverty for the remaining 20 million
people in next two years before the end of this century, the
projected objective for China's poverty alleviation will be
accomplished," said Yang, also a deputy to the NPC session.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the task is becoming increasingly tougher as
the majority of existing poor people are inhabited in most remote,
outlying mountainous areas, with arid land and little access to
the outside world due to backward transport conditions.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the central government encourages
relatively affluent provinces and cities to choose one or two
backward and less-developed areas as their cooperative partners to
lead these areas out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
"This has proved to be one of the most effective ways to help
the needy in the impoverished regions," Yang said.

<HEADLINE> Stones With Ancient Paintings Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have
discovered more than 60 stones with colored paintings dating back
to the Han Dynasty (206 B.C. to 220 A.D.) in 13 tombs found in
Shenmu County of northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists said this is the first time since the beginning
of this century that so many sandstones with colored paintings of
the Han Dynasty period have been unearthed in the province.
</P>
<P>
The stones were placed at the gates of the tombs and used as
symbols of gate-keeping.
</P>
<P>
The paintings on the stones include portraits of the Spring God
and Autumn God as well as tales of Jing Ke's attempt to kill Qin
Shihuang, the first emperor of the Qin Dynasty (221 to 207 B.C),
and other stories.
</P>
<P>
The painting of the Spring God is 1.03 meters high and 0.27
meters wide. The god has a human face and a bird's body, with a
three-feather hat. He is wearing a red coat and feather-skirt,
holding a red sun in his left hand and a square in his right
hand. A green dragon is under his feet and another dragon is
behind him.
</P>
<P>
The pictures were painted in pink, red, white, brown, green and
purple. Even the hair, beard and strings of ancient musical
instruments were painted clearly.
</P>
<P>
Experts here believe that the discovery of the stone paintings
is of great importance to research into the ancient arts, fairy
tales, music, dance and dress in China.

<HEADLINE> Park Established to Help Protect 500-Year-Old Walnut Tree </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- A 500-year-old walnut tree is
being well-protected by the villagers and local government at
Bagqi Town of Hotan County, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous region, who
established a seven-hectare plot for a park around it.
</P>
<P>
Known as the king of walnut trees, it is 10 meters high with a
trunk diameter of three meters. The width of its crown is 30
meters.
</P>
<P>
The tree is growing vigorously despite some damage to its
trunk. Every year it bears 2,500-to-3,000 walnuts.
</P>
<P>
As early as 1972, an investigation group of the Chinese
Ministry of Forestry and the Forestry Department in Xinjiang
determined that the tree was at least 500 years old.
</P>
<P>
The newly established park around the tree has become a walnut
garden with various fine varieties of walnuts including Xinfeng,
Xinlu and Hochun.
</P>
<P>
Special workers care for the king of walnut trees, such as
watering, providing fertilizer and keeping a record of its growing.

MANILA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Total international tourist
arrivals of about 650 million are forecast for the year 2000 with
global tourism receipts keeping on rising year by year, the
Philippine News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Philippine Tourism Secretary Mina Gabor, who
cited figures released by the World Tourism Organization, as
saying the total revenue from tourism will reach more than 500

</P>
<P>
Gabor said tourism has become a major industry in most
countries of the world and "third in importance after oil and
motor vehicles" in international trade.
</P>
<P>
Tourism receipts are greater than the world's exports of
selected products such as electronics, clothing, textiles and raw
materials, Gabor said.
</P>
<P>
The most successful tourist-receiving regions by far are East
Asia and the Pacific which have achieved successes in the past
four decades, she added.
</P>

She said the World Tourism Organization forecasts have revealed
that leisure tourism would grow faster than other travel

<HEADLINE> Beijing Refueling Automobiles With Liquefied Petroleum Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The first filling station using
liquefied petroleum gas has gone into operation in China's capital.
</P>
<P>
The station, located in Beijing's Chaoyang District, can
provide fuel for 200 automobiles with a 50-liter gas bottle daily.
</P>
<P>
Tests on 10 retrofitted automobiles shows that, by using
liquefied petroleum gas, the engine produces less noise, emissions
are reduced and all the functions of the automobiles remain the
same as when they use other kinds of fuel. However, the charge for
the fuel is 30 percent less.
</P>
<P>
Beijing now has more than 1.2 million motor vehicles using
gasoline and diesel oil, one of the city's major sources of air
pollution.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that to retrofit a vehicle with liquefied
petroleum gas, it is necessary to change the vehicle's engine
system and to test engine functions and emissions. Only those
passing related tests are allowed to run on the streets.
</P>
<P>
According to Beijing's Municipal Environmental Bureau, the city
will first retrofit some taxis and buses to expand the use of
liquefied petroleum gas.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai and Xiamen in east China are conducting similar tests
to replace gasoline and diesel fuel with liquefied petroleum gas.

<HEADLINE> Sino-U.S. Scientists Cooperate on New Therapy for Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and American scientists
have decided to join efforts in using "white arsenic," a
traditional Chinese poison that provokes maturity and death of
differentiated cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
A Sino-U.S. cancer differentiation therapy research center was
joinly established in Shanghai Wednesday by Ruijin Hospital
attached to Shanghai Second Medical University, the Shanghai
Institute of Hematology, Reliance Group Holdings, Inc. and Samuel
Waxman Cancer Research Fund from the United States.
</P>
<P>
This is believed to be the world's first research center on
differentiation therapy.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhenyi, honorary president of the Shanghai Institute of
Hematology and an academician of the Chinese Academy of
Engineering, said the new method is to differentiate cancer cells
and provoke their early maturity and death with arsenic trioxide,
a material used in many murder cases in ancient China.
</P>
<P>
He said no serious side-effects are caused by this therapy
while the commonly used chemo-therapy kills cancer cells together
with healthy cells and hinders normal blood formation.
</P>
<P>
The new cancer therapy will be based on China's achievements in
the clinical use of arsenic trioxide to treat acute promyelocytic
leukemia.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zhu, a hematology expert and academician of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences, believes the establishment of the research
center will encourage the application of differentiation therapy
in the treatment of liver and stomach cancers and other types of
leukemia.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement reached among the four parties, the
U.S. Reliance company is to offer 600,000 U.S. dollars in five
years for the center's research program.

<HEADLINE> New Forest Belt in Reservoir Area of China's Three Gorges Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- China will spend 6.6 billion
yuan on a large forest belt in the reservoir area of the Three
Gorges project.
</P>
<P>
The new forest belt will have an area exceeding 2 million
hectares and will cover 145 counties in the provinces of Hubei and
Sichuan and Chongqing Municipality.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges project, which is now under construction at
Sandouping of Yichang City, Hubei Province, on the middle reaches
of the Yangtze River, is the world's biggest water-control
project.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the project started in 1993 and will require
the relocation of 1.2 million residents. The entire project will
take 17 years. When the project is completed a gigantic dam will
be erected and a reservoir with a length of 600 kilometers will be
formed upstream.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has attached great importance to the
environment in the reservoir area and has financed the planting of
a forest-protection belt along the upper reaches of the Yangtze
River.
</P>
<P>
The newly planned forest project is expected to be able to
increase the forest cover of the reservoir area from the present
27 percent to 46 percent upon completion. The new forest project
will also play an important role in curbing soil erosion in the
reservoir area, improving the quality of the water in the Yangtze
and guaranteeing safe operation of the hydropower generators at
the Three Gorges Dam.
</P>
<P>
The new forest project, which has already been implemented in
Chongqing, will be finished in 2010, just one year after the
completion of the Three Gorges Dam in 2009.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Uganda will provide investors
with ideal facilities both in coffee and tea production and its
processing industries, President Yoweri Museveni said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan president told an Indian team of investors
visiting the country that Uganda has favorable conditions for
coffee and tea production.
</P>
<P>
Indian investors including Bhopana (just one name), managing
director of Consolidated Coffee Limited and S.M. White of the
Tata Limited told Museveni that their companies intend to invest
in coffee and tea industries in Uganda, Radio Uganda reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Museveni recently appealed to local entrepreneurs and foreign
investors to invest in Uganda's coffee processing industry to
increase the country's export income.
</P>
<P>
Coffee and tea are the main traditional foreign exchange
earners of the country. But Uganda only exports raw coffee seeds,
which earns 65 percent of the country's foreign exchange.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Aircraft Maintenance Company Wins International Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing-based Aircraft
Maintenance and Engineering Corp. (AMECO) was recently honored
with the Flight International Aerospace Industry Award for its
achievements in the international aircraft major maintenance and
modification market in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The prize is awarded every year by Flight International, a
leading publishing house in Britain, to those enterprises,
organizations, and individuals who have made significant
achievements in developing world aerospace and aviation technology
and management.
</P>
<P>
"One hundred and seventy entries for this year's awards, the
fifth of its kind, came from more countries than ever before,
reflecting the global nature of both the industry and its awards
program. Those which have won are truly the best of the best,"
said Allan Winn, editor-in-chief of Flight International.
</P>
<P>
In early 1997, AMECO finished repainting three Boeing-747-100s
from Northwest Airlines of the United States. Afterwards, the
corporation repainted aircraft for New Zealand, Vietnam and
Australia.
</P>
<P>
The real breakthrough came in August when AMECO completed a
D-check and strut modification for a B747-200 freighter for
Lufthansa of Germany. For AMECO, the job represents a first
venture into the European aircraft heavy maintenance market, as
the D-check is the highest level for aircraft maintenance and this
time the check fell on a B747 airliner, one of the most advanced
aircraft in the world.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the first success had already brought further
contracts. At the end of last year, Lufthansa sent another
B747-200 freighter for a C-check.
</P>
<P>
Air China and the German air carrier jointly set up Aircraft
Maintenance and Engineering Corp., Beijing, in May of 1989, making
it the largest joint venture in the history of China's civil
aviation.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Economic Growth at 2.9 Percent in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's economic growth was
registered at 2.9 percent last year, down from the 4.6 percent in
1996, according to the latest issue of the monthly economic
review issued by the Central Bank of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The bank said last year's growth figure for gross domestic
product (GDP) was the lowest since 1993 when economic growth
recorded 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The central bank predicted that the GDP growth is expected to
rebound to about 4.6 percent in the second half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The increase in growth in 1998 is expected to stem from the
continued sustenance of the favorable prices of the principal
agricultural exports," the bank report noted.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributed the slow-down in economic growth last year
to the significant decline in agriculture, manufacturing, trade
and tourism.
</P>
<P>
A general loss of investors' confidence in 1997 also
contributed to the depressed level of investment in almost all
sectors of the economy, it added.
</P>
<P>
The bank pointed out that the drought suffered in the first
half of last year and heavy rains caused by the El Nino
phenomenon late in 1997 in the predominantly agricultural areas
also adversely affected economic growth.

<HEADLINE> China to Launch Fourth Weather Satellite (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- China plans to launch a
replacement Fengyun 1 synchronous solar orbit meteorological
satellite next October, an official with the National
Meteorological Satellite Center (NMSC) said today.
</P>
<P>
All countries and regions in the world will have free access to
the new weather satellite's data, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The satellite will be the fourth weather satellite launched by
China.
</P>
<P>
China launched its first and second weather satellites in 1988
and 1990 respectively. However, the two satellites, both of the
Fengyun 1 series, have stopped functioning.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the country launched a Fengyun 2 weather satellite,
which was formally put into use in January this year and is
reportedly operating well.
</P>
<P>
Experts explain that the Fengyun 1 series weather satellites
are all synchronous solar orbit satellites, while the Fengyun 2
series satellites are in synchronous orbit with the earth.
</P>
<P>
"China holds that weather satellites should not be commercial;
they should serve the world free of charge, because the change of
weather respects no national border," the NMSC official said.
</P>
<P>
He said most countries in the Asia-Pacific Region can get
access to data sent back from the Fengyun 2 weather satellite,
which is in a geostationary orbit over 105 degrees east longitude.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the service life span of the current
Fengyun 2 weather satellite is three years. Before 2000, another
Fengyun 2 series satellite will be launched to sustain
meteorological data.
</P>
<P>
At present, a few countries and regions -- including the
United States, Russia, the European Union and China -- are able
to develop and launch weather satellites.

Experts say that weather satellites provide information to help
forecast such disasters as typhoons and rainstorms, to monitor
forest fires, and to estimate crop harvests.
</P>
<P>
An appraisal given by a group of scientists from the Chinese
Academy of Sciences last month spoke highly of the core
device of the Fengyun 2 weather satellite -- the multi-channel
scanning radiometer developed by the Shanghai Institute of
Technical Physics.
</P>
<P>
With high resolution, precision and reliability, the device
was a major breakthrough by China in its remote sensing
technology, the scientists said.
</P>
<P>
According to the scientists, both infrared and visible light
pictures sent back by the Fengyun 2 are of the same quality as
that made by other weather satellites.
</P>
<P>
As to the Fengyun 2 series weather satellite China plans to
launch before the year 2000, director Le Xiuhai of the Shanghai
Institute of Technical Physics said his institute has the
confidence to provide even better radiometers, so that China
and other countries can get better meteorological services.

<HEADLINE> Experts: "East Asian Miracle" Not Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The East Asian financial crisis
will affect the region's economic growth in the next few years,
but the "East Asian Miracle" is not over because the economic
fundamentals for steady growth have not been undermined by the
crisis, experts said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here at the end of an Asian
Development Forum (ADF) plenary session, Joseph Stiglitz, senior
vice president of the World Bank, said there have been remarkable
increases in per capita income and literacy and reduction in
poverty in East Asia in the past three decades.
</P>
<P>
"These are all the changes that are not going to be undermined
by the current turmoil," he said.
</P>
<P>
The region's growth is likely to slow down, but the overall
reasons for growth may be long-lasting, he said.
</P>
<P>
Stiglitz cited enormous increases in human capital, high
savings rates and marcroeconomic stability in East Asia as the
sound fundamentals for the long-term economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"The fundamentals should serve East Asia well into the coming
years as soon as the crisis gets over," he said.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier speech, Stiglitz blamed the poor management of
the financial sector, the huge short-term debts owed by the
private sector and high lendings to property sectors for the
outbreak of the Asian crisis last July.
</P>
<P>
He urged East Asian governments to maintain the strength of
their economies and political and economic stability to bolster
investors' confidence, which he said is important for the region
to end the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Peter Sullivan, vice president of the Asian
Development Bank (ADB), said in a report circulated at the meeting
that the East Asian miracle is not over and the long-term economic
outlook for the region is positive.
</P>
<P>
He said economic fundamentals that contributed to extraordinary
growth during the last 30 years are still in place and they
include a solid workforce, good macroeconomy and openness to
global markets.
</P>
<P>
"Looking forward next 30 years, we are projecting that East
Asia and South Asia will continue to grow, though the growth rate
of East Asian countries is unlikely to reach annually 7 percent as
it was," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the cause of the current crisis, Sullivan said one
strain is insufficient development of the financial sector,
regulation and supervision.
</P>
<P>
"With massive investment from abroad, Asian countries have not
been matched to such sophisticated investment," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said another strain is the downturn of trade compounded by a
downturn of global demand, which made Asian countries less
competitive.
</P>
<P>
The week-long conference is jointly organized by the ADB and
the World Bank to discuss lessons of the Asian crisis and Asia's
future development strategies. The meeting will end on Thursday
evening.

<HEADLINE> Roundup:India's PM Candidate Fails to Prove Support to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- With the Tamil Nadu allies
failing to forward their letters of support for a Bharatiya Janata
Party (BJP) led government till late Wednesday evening, BJP prime
ministerial candidate Atal Behari Vajpayee could not keep his
promise to present his documentary proof of support to President
K. R. Narayanan on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to Vajpayee on Tuesday, the president asked him
whether his party, which has emerged the largest party in the just
concluded general elections, was "able and willing" to form a
"stable government".
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee called on the president Tuesday evening and claimed to
be able to form a stable government. Then the president asked him
to present a documentary proof of his support and Vajpayee
promised to do so on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee and other BJP leaders were stumped by the seemingly
inexplicable delay of support from Tamil Nadu and were forced to
postpone an appointment with the president from Wednesday to
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The delay on the part of the Tamil Nadu allies has triggered
speculation in political circles here that Ms Jayalalitha, leader
of the allies in the State, was out to drive a hard bargain in
respect of her one-point demand: dismissal of the Dravida Munnetra
Kazhagam (DMK) government in the State.
</P>
<P>
All-India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) supremo
Jayalalitha Wednesday thrust a spanner in the works of the BJP by
demanding the scalp of the Karunanidhi government in lieu of her
support to Vajpayee's bid to form the next government at the
Center.
</P>
<P>
She has also prevailed upon her allies in the State not to give
support to Vajpayee till the time her demand to dismiss the State
government is conceded.
</P>
<P>
In addition to this demand, Jayalalitha is learnt to be
insisting on the inclusion of a couple of her nominees in the
Union Cabinet, about whom the BJP has grave reservations. On its
part, the BJP has so far refused to give a commitment to sack the
Karunanidhi government.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with the president Tuesday evening, Vajpayee had
claimed the support of 252 out of 543 MPs in the Lower House of
Parliament. Jayalalitha commands the allegiance of 27 MPs.
</P>
<P>
President Narayanan, who has the reputation of being a man who
goes by the "rule-book", is unlikely to initiate any further
action on the formation of the new government till he is fully
satisfied on the basis of documentary proof that the coalition
Government to be formed by Vajpayee would be a stable one.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the documentary proof of support from the allies,
the president is likely to expect a written reply from Vajpayee to
his letter sent on Tuesday in which the president had specifically
asked Vajpayee whether "he would be able and willing to form a
stable government which could secure the confidence of the House."

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Envoy Announces Level of Autonomy for Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav ambassador to Croatia,
Veljko Knezevic, said Kosovo would be given a certain level of
autonomy, but not "as it had under the previous constitution."
</P>
<P>
Under the 1974 constitution of the former Yugoslavia, Kosovo
had the status of a federal unit, as well as the status of a
former Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
Serbia cancelled Kosovo's autonomy in 1989 because the Albanian
separatists constituted the illegal "Kosovo Republic" and the
"Kosovo Liberation Army," which targeted the Yugoslav government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters here Wednesday, Knezevic said that at a
meeting in Belgrade on Tuesday, the Yugoslav government rejected
attempts to internationalize the Kosovo issue, because that would
mean meddling in the country's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Knezevic reiterated the stance of the Yugoslav government that
the actions of Serbian police in Kosovo had been directed
exclusively at ethnic Albanian terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Knezevic said there is no reason for the Kosovo crisis to
affect relations between Croatia and Serbia.

<P>
VIENNA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Chinese diplomat
called on the international community Wednesday to strengthen
cooperation in a worldwide struggle against drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
"Although some achievements were made last year in the
anti-drug struggle, the world community is still plagued by drug
abuse," said Ambassador Zhang Yishan, head of the Chinese
delegation to the 41st session of the U.N. Commission on Narcotic
Drugs.
</P>
<P>
"The drug issue threatens every country's social stability and
economic development," said Zhang, who is also the Chinese
permanent representative to the U.N. office in Vienna and other
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
"The most efficient way to combat drug abuse is for countries
to pursue a coordinated position on the issue and to strengthen
bilateral and multilateral cooperation," said Ambassador Zhang.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that U.N. drug control authorities
could work out strategies and measures through structural reform
and adjustment in the global anti-drug war.
</P>
<P>
The 41st session of the U.N. Commission on Narcotic Drugs,
which began on Wednesday, will last three days. During the
session, member states will review an annual report from U.N. drug
control authorities.

BANGKOK, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The National Industrial
Development Committee of Thailand has finalized a structural
adjustment plan for industrial sectors, the Nation newspaper

Measures under the plan include improving technology,
increasing skilled labor, developing small and medium-sized

environmental protection management for all of the sectors,
Somphob said.

glass, rubber, footwear and leather, drugs and chemicals, gems and
jewellery, wood and furniture, plastics, petrochemicals and steel.
</P>
<P>
Thailand received a loan package from the World Bank and the

experiencing difficulties resulting from the shrinking industrial
sector.

<P>
The plan will be submitted for cabinet approval next week.

<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister
Qian Qichen said here today that with the resettlement of the Hong
Kong issue and scheduled exchange of visits by senior government
leaders, Sino-British relations will witness greater development
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Qian made these remarks at a press conference in response to a
question by a reporter from the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong used to be a problem between China and Britain left
over by history. The two countries once fought war over Hong Kong,
and also had conflicts and disputes over the Hong Kong issue,"
noted Qian.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, this 150-year-plus history has already become
by-gones with Hong Kong's return to its motherland, which was
recognized by the British government.
</P>
<P>
"With the resolution of this question left over from the past,
the relations between the two major powers of China and Britain
will surely enjoy greater growth in all areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
He further noted that British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook has
already paid a visit to China, and British Prime Minister Tony
Blair is also going to visit China later this year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, the Chinese premier will attend the second
Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) scheduled to be held in London in
April, and also visit Britain.
</P>
<P>
"So I believe this year will witness greater development in
Sino-British relations," Qian said.

BELGRADE, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslavian government has
rejected international pressure over its handling of the Kosovo
conflict, describing it as "interference" in its internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
A government statement issued Wednesday said tough action
against terrorism was the legitimate right and duty of a sovereign
state.

The government was responding to the emergency meeting on
Monday of the Contact Group on Former Yugoslavia which proposed
sanctions against Belgrade over the conflict between Serbian

The statement described the meeting as a gross violation of
international law against the discussion of a domestic issue of a
sovereign state at international occasions.
</P>
<P>
It reiterated the Yugoslavian government would cooperate with
the international community under conditions of respect to its
sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
The statement called on the international community to refrain
from any action which may encourage the secessionists in Kosovo
and further destablize the province.

BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 Chinese
governmental officials, entrepreneurs and scholars will go to
Germany for the Leipzig Transport and Logistics Fair to try to
improve international exchanges and cooperation, said today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
During the four-day fair, an event dubbed "China Days Transport

</P>
<P>
The event will not only demonstrate to the world the present
state of China's transport sector in a 200-square-meter exhibition
area, but also give three seminars on China's transport facilities
and management.
</P>
<P>
The Leipzig Transport and Logistics Fair is one of the few
trade fairs in Germany and Europe which have a complex selection
of goods involving public and cargo transport and includes all
transport companies and their interfaces.
</P>
<P>
The fair will be an excellent opportunity for Chinese
professionals in the transportation industry to get in touch with
their European counterparts, noted the Beijing-based paper.
</P>
<P>
Though China's transport has developed a lot in the past four
decades, it still cannot meet the demands of the rapid economic
development.

<TEXT>
<P>
March 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said
that conditions are ripe to hold cross-Straits political
negotiations under the principle of "one China".
</P>
<P>
Qian made the remark at a press conference hosted by the
ongoing session of the Ninth National People's Congress here
today.
</P>
<P>
He said that negotiations should be held in accordance with the
principle of "one China". In this way can Taiwan compatriots'
desire to seek peace and security be satisfied, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that a step-by-step approach can be adopted before
further talks are held. And the first step is to end hostilities
across the Taiwan Straits, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is reasonable to hold procedural talks to discuss the name,
form and ways of negotiations, he said, adding that all kinds of
matters can be discussed.
</P>
<P>
According to previous experiences, there were political
obstacles when business talks were held, he said
</P>
<P>
Qian said he welcomes the expansion of cross-Straits exchanges,
including exchanges between the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits and Straits Exchange Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan issue used to be a very clear one but it has become
complicated now, he said, adding that he does not understand why
Taiwan is afraid of talking about "one China".
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan authorities used to adhere to "one China" but now
they have backed down from that position, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is totally unnecessary to be afraid of talking about "one
China," he said. Both sides should recognize that there is one
China in the world before the reunification, that Taiwan is part
of China, and that China's territory and sovereignty cannot be
separated, he said.

<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen said here today that Taiwan's activities
during the Southeast Asian financial crisis will produce no good
results.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference given today hosted by the First
Session of the Ninth National People's Congress, he noted that the
financial crisis started from Southeast Asia last July and later spread to
many countries.
</P>
<P>
Last October, he recalled, Taiwan announced all of sudden the
devaluation of the New Taiwan Dollar by 10 percent, thus leading
to another round of devaluation. Actually, Taiwan added fuel to
the flame of the southeast Asian financial crisis, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
It should be noted that senior Taiwan officials repeatly
mentioned that the Chinese RMB would soon be devaluated. After
that, Taiwan officials traveled to many countries in the region on
many occasions in an attempt to benefit from these countries'
difficult situation and seek their political ulterior motives, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"So I think the activities of Taiwan harbor evil intentions and
i don't think they will produce any good results," Qian said.

<HEADLINE> More Trees to Be Planted This Spring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- South China is greener this
spring after large areas were planted with seedlings, reported
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Eight provinces and autonomous regions in south China have
completed soil preparation on more than one million
hectares. Trees have been planted on 734,000 hectares, up 84
percent from the same period of last year, said the State
Forestry Bureau, transformed from the former Ministry of Forestry
in the government's institutional restructure.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi, Shanxi and Zhejiang provinces and the Tibet Autonomous
Region took action last autumn and winter to urge strengthened
afforestation work.
</P>
<P>
To employ more science and technology in tree planting, Hubei
Province raised seedlings of advanced species on more than 4,000
hectares. They are expected to occupy the market, which used to
be filled with fake and inferior seeds.
</P>
<P>
This year's national spring afforestation has started, although
more places in northern China such as Beijing will begin tree
planting in April.
</P>
<P>
In the past two decades, each year witnessed a growth of 5.3
million hectares of trees. Statistics indicate that 90 percent of
the trees are well preserved. It is reported that 2.4 billion
trees were planted each year.
</P>
<P>
China is home to 33.3 million hectares of human-planted trees,
by far the most in the world. There are 137 million hectares of
forested land at present, compared with 115 million hectares at
the beginning of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
With a forest coverage rate of 13.9 percent, China is striving
to reach a goal of 15.5 percent by the end of 2000.

BELGRADE, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A Serbian government delegation
of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will head to Kosovo on
Thursday for a dialogue with the ethnic Albanian community, the
government said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will consist of Deputy Prime Minister Ratko
Markovic and two ministers.

The Serbian Information Ministry said the delegation would have
"open and public" talks in the provincial capital of Pristina,
with those ethnic Albanian political leaders who were considered
widely representative.

<P>
The Serbian government invited other Serbian parliamentary
parties to send their delegates to the talks.
</P>
<P>
It described the proposed talks as a demonstration of the
government's determination to resolve the Kosovo issue in line
with the Constitution and international standards.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian government's decision came a day after the Contact

<HEADLINE> Mussolini's Fiat Auctioned in Geneva </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The 1944 Fiat sport car, in which
the Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini and his lover
Claretta Petacci tried to escape from Italy, was sold Wednesday
for 156,000 Swiss Francs (about 105,000 U.S. dollars) at Brooks
vintage car auction in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
As auctioneers put it, the black, two-door, seven-meter-long
plush Fiat 2800 was "unique." Besides representing "a page in
Italian history," it was one of only three Fiat 2800s in the world
built by Tourism of Milan.
</P>
<P>
The two others, which have been lost without a trace, belonged
to Italy's exiled King Humbert II and the Spanish Royal House
respectively, they said.
</P>
<P>
In April, 1945, Mussolini and Claretta were caught in the car
when they tried to flee Italy. The Fiat, regarded as a symbol of
fascism, was dumped in Lake Como. However, it was eventually
hauled out and smuggled to Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
After many years and several owners, it became the property of
a wealthy Swiss family in 1950 and was completely restored in 1980.
</P>
<P>
The names of the Swiss family and the buyer were not revealed
at the auction.
</P>
<P>
The auctioneers said the Fiat, with a red-leather interior and
weighing 2,300 kilos, can travel at a maximum speed of 140
kilometers per hour. And the car has traveled less than 1,000
kilometers, they added.
</P>
<P>
Other vintage cars for auction included a 1938 Chrysler
Imperial C-19, a 1938 Bugatti, a 1919 Ford Tudor sedan, a 1933
Rolls Royce Phantom and a 1912 Bispano-Suiza.

<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- China is taking a responsible
approach in the recent financial crisis in southeast Asia and
will, as always, develop friendly cooperative ties with these
countries, Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the remarks here this morning at a press conference
sponsored by the ongoing first session of the Ninth National
People's Congress, when asked to comment on the financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
China sympathizes with southeast Asian countries on the impact
of the financial crisis on these countries.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We have also participated in an IMF rescue package
for these countries. China has transferred some amount of money to
the operational budget of the IMF and also provided financial
support for some countries in this region through bilateral
channels."
</P>
<P>
"What is more important, we have not devaluated the Chinese
yuan because of the devaluation of other currencies in this
region. This is a responsible approach that China has taken so
that the financial situation in this region can stabilize at an
early date and turn for the better," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a contribution China makes to the region," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
"We are, as always, very positive in developing friendly
relations and cooperation with the southeast Asian countries.
There is no change of policy whatsoever in this regard," he added.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM to Visit Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto is scheduled to arrive here Saturday evening for a
two-day working visit, an official of the Japanese embassy in
Jakarta told Xinhua Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto is believed to bridge a dispute between the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and President Soeharto over the
latter's plan to peg the rupiah (national currency) at a fixed
rate to the U.S. dollar under a currency board system (CBS).
</P>
<P>
"The two leaders are expected to focus their discussion on the
current economic crisis in the region, especially in Indonesia,
and on what Japan can do to help our country," the local English
newspaper "the Jakarta Post" also quoted a senior official here,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto's office announced earlier in Tokyo that the Prime
Minister would hold bilateral talks with President Soeharto on
Sunday and would leave Jakarta after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He will be the first foreign leader to meet with Soeharto after
the president's reelection on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Japan is Indonesia's largest trading partner and creditor and
has pledged 5 billion U.S. dollars to support the 43 billion U.S.
dollars IMF rescue package for Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, the IMF delayed its promised 3 billion U.S.
dollars to Indonesia because of the so-called lack of reforms in
the country. Meanwhile, the World Bank and the Asian Development
Bank (ADB) also delayed their loans to Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Expects to Attract More Tourists From U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Tourism Authority of Thailand
(TAT) is looking forward to more visitors from the United States
when tourists from Southeast Asia declined drastically, a leading
English newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, about 311,000 Americans visited Thailand, making up
less than 5 percent of the total arrivals. But in January this
year, U.S. visitors to Thailand increased by 4.23 percent to
35,582 compared to the same month a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
In view of more potential in the U.S. market, the TAT is
switching gear to suit the market demand, the Bangkok Post quoted
a TAT senior official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The TAT will offer promotional inland air fares, including four
stops for less than 200 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the authority is making conscious efforts to keep
tourists in Thailand rather than to share them with other
countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
</P>
<P>
To those who want to stay in Thailand, the TAT will give
discount coupons, promoting walking tours and working with Thai
Airways for special fares around the country, said the official,
who is in charge of North American east coast market.
</P>
<P>
"With the depreciation of the baht and last year's inflation
rate of only 8 percent, Thailand still represents the most
remarkable value for the leisure and business travelers," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Manila Raises Minimum Bank Capitalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Central Bank has
approved a new round of increase in the minimum capitalization
requirement for banks ranging from 22 percent to a high of 75
percent, a leading newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The central bank also approved accelerating the 2 percent
general loan loss reserve provisioning with full implementation by
October 1, 1999, the Manila Bulletin reported.
</P>
<P>
Central bank governor Gabriel Singson said in a statement
released late Wednesday night that the increase in the
capitalization depends on the classification of the bank.
</P>
<P>
For the expanded commercial banks, the minimum capital base has
been jacked up by 57 percent to 5.5 billion pesos (137.5 million
U.S. dollars) from the existing requirement of 3.5 billion pesos
(87.5 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the ordinary commercial banks'
capitalization was almost doubled to 3 billion pesos (75 million
dollars) from the current requirement of 1.625 billion pesos
(40.625 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The deadline for compliance with the new capitalization
requirements has been set for December 31, 2000, Singson said.

The European Union is already prepared to impose an arms
embargo on this region, and the United Nations has not yet

appropriate place for the discussion of this matter, because you
can imagine if arms embargo is only imposed on Yugoslavia, that
may not be able to resolve this matter totally.

<HEADLINE> Italy Urges Kosovo Albanians to End Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini Wednesday urged ethnic Albanians in Yugoslavia's province of
Kosovo to end violence and enter into dialogue with Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Dini said that the Kosovo Albanians and Belgrade, the two sides
involved in the conflict, must immediately stop violence, in which
about 80 people have been killed.
</P>
<P>
The Albanians in Kosovo "must choose the way of dialogue" to
attain the degree of autonomy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Italy greatly regrets what happened in the past weeks in
Kosovo, Dini said.
</P>
<P>
Italy and other countries are making efforts to bring the two
sides to the negotiating table, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the outcome of the London meeting of the six-nation Contact
Group for the former Yugoslavia Monday, Dini said that the
fundamental request advanced by the group was to convince Belgrade
to talks.
</P>
<P>
"I think we are moving in the hoped-for direction, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi told parliament Wednesday
that the Italian ambassador to Yugoslavia has been instructed to
talk Belgrade and the Kosovo Albanians into dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador is in contact with the Albanians in the province
to work for "a clear signal of the will to seek out a way to
negotiations with Belgrade," Prodi said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Italian Foreign Undersecretary Piero Fassino said
Monday that an explosion of the crisis in Kosovo could have
serious consequences on the political balance in the Balkans.
</P>

<HEADLINE> EU, Macedonia Favor Political Solution to Kosovo Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) and
Macedonia agreed Wednesday that the Kosovo issue must be settled
politically through negotiations between Belgrade and ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
EU special envoy Tony Lloyd, who paid a brief visit to Skoplje
Wednesday, and Macedonian Foreign Minister Blagoj Handziski also
agreed that a solution to the Kosovo issue should be found without
altering the borders of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Skoplje, Lloyd, who is also the British
minister of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs, held talks
with Handziski and Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov. He briefed
them on the results of the meeting of the Contact Group on Bosnia
held in London on Monday.
</P>
<P>
At the one-day emergency meeting in London, the Contact Group
reportedly called for "an arms embargo against" Yugoslavia and
threatened to freeze its assets unless Belgrade "halts the
violence in Kosovo and starts talking peace."
</P>
<P>
President Gligorov told Lloyd that Macedonia appreciated the
serious concern of the international community for a peaceful
solution to the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
He said in view of the current situation in Kosovo, the United
Nations Preventive Deployment Forces (UNPREDF) in Macedonia are
very important for the stability of the country.
</P>
<P>
He thanked the Contact Group for proposing an extension of the
UNPREDF mandate in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Lloyd said that sanctions against Yugoslavia will be tightened
if there is no improvement in the situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Lloyd flew to Skoplje from Albania and will continue on to
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo is a province of the Republic of Serbia in
Yugoslavia. Ethnic conflicts in the province, where ethnic
Albanians make up 90 percent of the population, have led to heavy
casualties in the past two weeks.

</P>

</P>
<P>
Calling the Balkan region a place with very complex relations

protected.
</P>
<P>
However, the foreign minister called for efforts to be made to
prevent and guard against splittist activities conducted by some
extremists.
</P>
<P>
"If no caution is paid in this regard, then it may give
rise to extensive regional turmoils or even conflicts," Qian
warned.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that any measure to be taken by the international
community in dealing with this situation should be both conducive
to regional peace and stability and refraining from interfering in
the internal affairs of the countries concerned.

WASHINGTON -- U.S. President Bill Clinton has exempted Vietnam
from a Cold War law that restricts trade because of limit
emigration, the White House said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The president based his decision on Vietnam's track record of
progress on emigration over the past 15 years and its accelerated
efforts in recent months," the White House said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said on Tuesday that Clinton signed a waiver to
the so-called Jackson-Vanik amendment, which prevents the
U.S. government from giving trade and investment funding to
nations that do not allow their citizens to emigrate or travel
abroad freely.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's decision will make Vietnam eligible for financial
backing from the U.S. Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private
Investment Corp, but does not grant it the Most Favored Nation
trade status. (US-Vietnam-Trade Waiver)

1990.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Hold Talks With Annan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan has held talks with President Bill Clinton and his foreign
policy team members, discussing a range of issues including Iraq,
the White House said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed U.S. arrears of payment to the
United Nations and the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The president reiterated the administration's firm support for
U.N. dues, our arrears," a senior administration official told a
briefing after Clinton's talks with Annan.
</P>
<P>
He said President Clinton had reiterated his commitment to work
with Congress and the leadership of Congress "so that we can get
those appropriations made this year."
</P>
<P>
According to Article 19 of the U.N. Charter, any U.N. member
state which is in two years consecutive arrears may lose voting
rights in the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. debt to the United Nations at the end of 1997 was 1.3
billion dollars for regular dues and peacekeeping expenses. It is
rising to 1.7 billion dollars in 1998. If the United States does
not come up with the money it should pay to the United Nations by
the end of this calendar year, it will be two years in arrears in
total, above the threshold level that Article 19 sets. And
washington would lose its voting right in the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The senior official said Clinton had promised to Annan that he
would exert "his maximum efforts to get Congress to appropriate
those funds."
</P>
<P>
The issue of Iraq was the main topic that Annan discussed first
with Clinton, then with National Security Adviser Sandy Berger,
the senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
The president and the secretary-general agreed on the need for
vigilance now in monitoring Iraqi compliance with the arrangement
that were made in the memorandum of understanding that the
secretary-general signed with Iraq Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
"There was agreement... that one week of successful inspections
and one week of Iraqi compliance is far from adding up to the kind
of sustained, long-term Iraqi compliance with the Security Council
resolutions and the memorandum of understanding," the senior
official said.
</P>
<P>
At a photo session before talks with Annan, Clinton said the
United States would consult with U.N. Security Council members
before resorting to force against Iraq if it failed to comply with
its agreement, reached with Annan, on weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
But he insisted that the United States need not any approval
from the United Nations for any kind of attack on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the resolution gives us the authority to take
whatever actions are necessary but of course we would consult,"
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the Middle East, Clinton and Annan discussed
briefly the need for movement forward in the Arab-Israeli peace
process, the senior official said.
</P>
<P>
"The president and Secretary of State (Madeleine) Albright, who
was also in the meeting, underscored our view that we cannot
continue without some movement forward on the peace process and
that the burden is on the leadership of the Israeli and
Palestinian authority to take the hard decisions necessary to move
this process forward," he said.

<HEADLINE> Canadians Make Record Visa Purchases in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Canadian consumers made a record
64.8 billion dollars (46 billion U.S. dollars) in purchases on
their Visa cards in 1997, Visa Canada said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
That accounted for 12.2 percent of all purchases made by
Canadian consumers during the year, and was 12 percent higher than
the purchases on Canadian Visa cards in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Canada's most populous province Ontario accounted for 43
percent of the 1997 total, charging just over 27 billion dollars
on Visa cards, followed by British Columbia and Quebec with 11.7
billion and 9.9 billion dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
Visa Canada President Derek Fry attributed this strong
performance to the strength of the Canadian economy, which grew
3.8 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The successful expansion of Visa into non-traditional market
segments such as grocery, health care and government payments was
also a major factor.

<HEADLINE> UK Gov't Urged to Ban Smoking in Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A scientific group Wednesday urged
the British government to ban smoking in public after finding that
passive smoking causes lung cancer and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
The Scientific Committee on Tobacco and Health said in a report
that long-term exposure to other people's smoke can cause lung
cancer and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
The report, published to coincide with National No Smoking Day,
is the first major study by a government committee on tobacco and
health for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
In the report, health experts called on ministers to curb
smoking in thousands of public places.
</P>
<P>
The report said there was "an importance and urgency with the
smoking problem that needs to be recognized by both the government
and the public."
</P>
<P>
Government Chief Medical Officer Kenneth Calman indicated that
curbs on public smoking may appear in a forthcoming White Paper.
</P>
<P>
"The message is absolutely clear. Passive smoking is bad for
your health.... From my own point of view, I think the case is very
strong," he told BBC Radio.

<HEADLINE> New Study Finds Hardcore Drug Users More Numerous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- New ways of counting show the
number of hardcore drug users in Chicago and surrounding Cook
County in Illionis is much higher than previous estimates, said
federal researchers.
</P>
<P>
The study, released Wednesday by Barry McCaffrey, director of
the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, raises the
possibility that the conventional estimate of 13 million regular
drug users in the country at large is far too low.
</P>
<P>
The Cook County study estimates there are about 330,000
habitual users of cocaine, crack cocaine and heroin in the
urbanized county. Previous studies estimated the number of
residents using drugs other than marijuana at 117,000.
</P>
<P>
Calling the Chicago-area findings "unsettling," McCaffrey said
it raises questions about whether the national estimate of 13
million hardcore drug users should be larger. "I would lean in the
direction of saying yes," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hardcore use is defined as the use of heroin, powder cocaine or
crack cocaine on eight or more days during at least one of the
preceding eight months, the drug policy office said.
</P>
<P>
"Hardcore drug users maintain the illegal drug market,"
McCaffrey said, "and they provide a spring from which new
epidemics of drug use flow."
</P>
<P>
The Chicago-area research will be followed up, if Congress
approves, by surveys in other areas of the country, McCaffrey
said, emphasizing the need for accurate estimates of drug users.

<HEADLINE> Cook Not Optimistic About His Middle East Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said Wednesday that he did not hope his Middle East trip next
week would achieve easy progress on the stalled peace process
there.
</P>
<P>
Cook, whose country now holds the current European Union (EU)
presidency, told a news conference, "I am by no means complacent
about the problem. I do not hold out any facile hopes of easy
progress."
</P>
<P>
"But I believe that if the international community does apply
intensive diplomatic pressure, then we will be able to get the
peace process moving again," he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretary will visit Egypt, Jordan, the Palestinian
self-ruled territories, Israel, Syria and Lebanon from 15-18
March.
</P>
<P>
He will meet political leaders in each country, launching a new
EU drive to restart the Middle East peace process, which has been
stalled for almost a year.
</P>
<P>
Cook reiterated that the search for a way to reinvigorate the
Middle East peace process was one of the key foreign policy
priorities for the UK's EU presidency, which ends in June.
</P>
<P>
He said that during his visit, he would make it clear to
Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu that he had to stick to the Oslo
peace framework which laid out the path to a final settlement.
</P>
<P>
"I'll go to Israel with the clear message that the Oslo accords
were signed by both parties.... Netanyahu has an international
legal obligation to make the agreements work."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cook said that he would also tell the Palestinians
that they had to take action to stop guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
But he refused to point out what the EU would do if Israel and
the Palestinian authorities did not return to the negotiating
table.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to spell out whether anything might be done if
there is no progress. I go in a sense of partnership, hoping to
achieve progress," he said.

<HEADLINE> Britain Pledges to Press Ahead With EU-Cyprus Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The British government, the
current European Union (EU) president, promised Wednesday that the
membership talks of Cyprus with the EU should proceed as planned.
</P>
<P>
Britain, which is to hold a one-day conference on EU
enlargement in London Thursday, made the statement amid reports
that the French government openly voiced doubts whether the
membership talks with Cyprus should go ahead as the two
communities in Cyprus failed to form a joint delegation for the
London conference.
</P>
<P>
A Downing Street spokesman said Wednesday, "The accession
process embraces Cyprus and the countries of eastern Europe. That
is what was agreed and that is what we will be pursuing."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made it clear that the 15-nation bloc must press
ahead with the Cyprus membership talks even if the Turkish
Cypriots refuse to take part. The unrecognized Turkish state in
the north of the island could not have a veto over the issue, he
said.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair was expected to tell
Thursday's meeting that the door to eventual EU membership was not
closed, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Blair would also tell the potential members over dinner at 10
Downing Street Wednesday night that the process of joining the EU
would not be easy and would demand sacrifices, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Blair was also expected to urge Cyprus to ease
tension in the eastern Mediterranean by scrapping a controversial
deal to arm itself with Russian ground-to-air missiles.
</P>

LONDON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
ended mixed Wednesday, with Frankfurt ending slightly down and
London and Paris hitting new record closing highs.

<P>
Britain's FTSE 100 had earlier touched an intra-day peak of
5,861.9 before closing at 5,829.8, up only 1.3 points or 0.02
percent, yet its third record close of the month, lifted by a
firmer Wall Street and selective buying of leading stocks.

Dealers said that different influences, such as possible
European rate hikes amid strong economic growth, the forthcoming
budget and sterling strength will be weighing on the market.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares closed little changed, with the
DAX-30 index down 1.67 points or 0.03 percent at 4,832.76, boosted
by a stronger Dow and the continued strength of the dollar, but
were well off their highs as the market consolidated recent record
gains.
</P>

The CAC-40 index in Paris closed at 3,539.43, up 17.92 points
or 0.51 percent, a new closing high, also supported by a strong

<HEADLINE> UK Gov't Defends EU Decision on China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The British government Wednesday
defended a European Union decision not to sponsor a resolution at
the United Nations critical of China's human rights record.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair said in parliament that he did not
think a United Nations resolution was "the right way to proceed,"
but his government would keep raising the issue.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in nine years that Britain, the current EU
president, has not signed the resolution.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member EU has decided recently not to table a resolution
at the U.N.'s Commission on Human Rights meeting in Geneva this
year, saying dialogue is better than confrontation with China
concerning the human rights issue.

<HEADLINE> Two Men Charged With Murders in Northern Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A British court charged two men
Wednesday with the killing of a Protestant and a Catholic in a pub
in Northern Ireland last week.
</P>
<P>
But a detective told the magistrate in the town of Newry,
County Down in Northern Ireland, that the two accused men, Ryan
Robley, 28 and David Keys, 26, had denied killing Philip Allen, a
Protestant, and Damien Trainor, a Roman Catholic.
</P>
<P>
The victims, lifelong friends despite the sectarian divisions,
were killed on March 3 by gunmen who stormed into a Roman
Catholic-owned pub in the village of Poyntzpass and opened fire
before fleeing away.
</P>
<P>
The killings were part of a shooting spree by rival pro-British
Protestant and pro-Irish Catholic guerrilla groups that has
claimed a total of 15 lives since late December.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two more men were charged with the murders of Allen
and Trainor, and they will appear in court at Banbridge, County
Down Thursday, police said.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Capacity Utilization Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Canadian firms slightly increased
their rate of capacity use in the fourth quarter of 1997, closer
to the peak reached in 1988, said reports Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Capacity utilization hit 85.6 percent in the quarter, up 0.3
percent and only 1.2 percent points below the 10-year record of
86.8 percent, according to the latest Statistics Canada figures.
</P>
<P>
Inflationary pressures develop when the economy approaches
capacity. However, there were few signs of rising prices.
</P>
<P>
"Despite these high rates, industry prices have remained
relatively stable for the past two years and labor costs have also
changed little over that period," the statistics agency was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The country's inflation was 1.1 percent in January. It is
forecast that Canada would have an inflation of 1 to 2 percent for
all of 1998, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Has Passed Test of Fire in Financial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, the chief executive
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, said here
Wednesday that Hong Kong has "passed the test of fire" through the
financial crisis which devastated many Asian nations last year.
</P>
<P>
"Those with free markets, strong regulation, rule of law and
stringent fiscal discipline, such as Hong Kong and Singapore, have
passed the test of fire," said Tung in a speech addressed to the
French National Employers' Association CNPF.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong has a "low, consistent and simple tax
structure, an open and accountable government, and a clean and
corruption free civil service."
</P>
<P>
"Most importantly, we believe strongly in upholding the rule of
law," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that being an externally oriented economy, Hong
Kong needs certainty in exchange rates and will not abandon its
14-year-old currency board system which provides full U.S. dollar
backing for the Hong Kong dollar.
</P>
<P>
"In the recent round of attacks on the Hong Kong dollar, the
currency board system has proven to be most effective," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tung again stressed that Hong Kong does not need to devalue the
Hong Kong dollar, as it is not in the interests of Hong Kong to do
so.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Economy to Top G-7 in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Canada is set to outperform the
rest of the Group of Seven countries in economic growth this year,
according to the latest report by the Conference Board of Canada.
</P>
<P>
The pace of growth in Canada is expected to slow to 3.2 percent
this year after a 3.8-percent advance in 1997, the Ottawa-based
economic thinktank predicted.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown will happen because of a maturing business cycle,
Asian market weakness and higher interest rates, said Peter Lok,
the board's senior research associate.
</P>
<P>
The G-7 nations will collectively post gains in their gross
domestic product (GDP) of 2.1 percent in 1998, down sharply from
the 2.7 percent growth in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Canada's GDP will slow further to 2.8 percent, but
that would still rank it second among the G-7 economies after
Italy's 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
"This depreciation will result from slower growth in the U.S.
economy and the impact of higher interest rates domestically," Lok
said.
</P>
<P>
The outlook for the G-7 as a whole in 1999 is for GDP growth to
moderate to 1.9 percent, the board said.

<HEADLINE> Britain Urges Immediate Dialogue on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The British government Wednesday
urged the Yugoslav government and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo to
start a political dialogue on resolving their disputes as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Kosovo ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova had earlier called for independence for the troubled
province, while Belgrade ruled out any reconciliation talks until
the demand of total independence was dropped.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the latest development of the Kosovo crisis, a
British Foreign Office source was quoted by Reuters as saying that
it was "vital that both sides should urgently begin dialogue
without preconditions."
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Office source noted that the six-nation Contact
Group, namely the United States, Russia, Britain, France,
Germany and Italy, was willing to act as intermediary if the
current stand-off is unable to ease off.
</P>
<P>
Under the joint statement issued after the one-day Contact
Group meeting held in London Monday, all the Contact Group members
made it clear that they do not support the ethnic Albanians'
demand for an independent Kosovo but urge the Belgrade government
to grant the province autonomy.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that some 80 people have been killed in recent
bloody clashes between Serbian police and the Kosovo Liberation
Army in Kosovo, where 90 percent of its population are ethnic
Albanians.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Refuses to Comment on Testimony Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Wednesday refused to comment on reports that his lawyers are
negotiating with independent counsel Kenneth Starr to provide
presidential testimony in the Monica Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
At a joint photo opportunity with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, Clinton refused to take reporters' questions about any such
testimony.
</P>
<P>
"I am not going to talk about that today," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Annan was at the White House to brief Clinton on his recent
agreement with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to let U.N.
inspectors search for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The president told reporters, "I have got to do the work that
the people in this country hired me to do."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, Jim Kennedy, spokesman for the White House
counsel's office, said no one at the White House will have any
comment on reported negotiations between Clinton's personal
lawyers and Starr's office.
</P>
<P>
Starr heads a grand jury investigation into allegations against
Clinton, including whether he had an affair with Lewinsky and then
urged her to lie about it under oath when providing an affidavit
in a separate suit.
</P>
<P>
Although there have been reports about the negotiations between
the two sides, Kennedy said, "We have made no announcement
regarding this issue.... We're just not having any comment."
</P>
<P>
Media reports said the president is willing to answer questions
about the Lewinsky matter, but only after the former White House
intern has testified before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
However, negotiations between Starr's office and lawyers for
Lewinsky have broken down, and her appearance before the grand
jury has not yet been scheduled.
