   Pitchers risk careers &QL; 
with line-drive injuries
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By NEIL HOHLFELD &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
The frightening, whack-whack sound of bat hitting ball and ball
hitting pitcher is becoming all too commonplace in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   When Astros reliever Billy Wagner was hit in the left ear by a
line drive off the bat of Arizona's Kelly Stinnett on Wednesday
night in Phoenix, it marked the fourth time in the past 14 months a
major-league pitcher has been struck in the head by a batted ball.
Though Wagner suffered a concussion and tissue damage to his ear,
he has no broken bones and could return in one to two weeks. That
is in contrast to three incidents since May 1997. In those cases:
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's Willie Blair suffered a broken jaw when he was hit by
a line drive off the bat of Cleveland's Julio Franco on May 4,
1997. Blair missed about five weeks but returned to have a 16-8
season, his best in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore reliever Norm Charlton was hit by Frank Thomas' line
drive this past April 29. Charlton received four stitches and
suffered a displaced nose fracture but did not go on the disabled
list.
</P>
<P>
   Just more than two weeks after Charlton was struck by Thomas,
Baltimore's Mike Mussina was hit by a line drive off the bat of
Cleveland's Sandy Alomar Jr. on May 15. Mussina suffered a broken
nose and a gash above his right eye and missed three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most well-known incident involving a pitcher struck
by a line drive occurred more than 40 years ago. Cleveland
lefthander Herb Score was hit in the eye by a line drive off the
bat of New York's Gil McDougald, altering a career that seemed
destined for greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Score was 36-19 in two seasons before the accident, striking out
508 batters in 473 innings. He was 20-9 with 263 strikeouts in 1956
as a 21-year-old and was being hailed as a lefthanded Bob Feller.
But after Score was hit by McDougald's liner, he was 17-26 in five
subsequent seasons with Cleveland and the Chicago White Sox. He
retired in 1963 at the age of 28.
</P>
<P>
   Blair also was a different pitcher last season after being hit
by Franco's liner, which was clocked at 107 mph _ but it was for
the better. A journeyman righthander who'd had limited success with
Cleveland, the Astros, Colorado, San Diego and Detroit, Blair went
13-6 after the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit pitching coach Rick Adair said he believed that after
Blair was hit, he changed his delivery to better protect himself
from line drives. Subsequently, Adair said, Blair kept the ball
lower in the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, who was in his free-agent season in 1997, parlayed his
13-6 finish into a three-year contract with Arizona. Pitching for
the expansion Diamondbacks, Blair is 3-13 and leads the majors in
defeats.
</P>
<P>
   Mussina, who won 19 games for Baltimore in 1995 and '96, was
109-51 over eight-plus seasons when he was hit by Alomar's line
drive. In his first three starts after returning to the roster,
Mussina was 1-2 with an 8.44 ERA. But he has pitched better lately
and is 7-5, 3.67 for a team that is well under .500.

DESPITE SLUGGISH SALES AND RATINGS, TURNER STILL UPBEAT ON GOODWILL
GAMES  
 (JT )
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to clarify the time element in the lede graf and to add 4 new
grafs at the end; a few minor alterations elsewhere)   By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Who cares if the first three Goodwill Games have lost
$109 million? Not Ted Turner. A few days before the fourth edition
_ starting in New York Saturday with opening ceremonies at Battery
Park _ Turner abruptly dashed across his 29th floor office in Time
Warner's Manhattan headquarters to fiddle with his deskside
computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ha! I made $150 million today!'' he said, analyzing the
late-afternoon action of his 60 million shares of Time Warner
stock. Eyes twinkling, he told a visitor, ``But I've lost $50
million since you've been here!''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Turner's paper gain on Wednesday amounted to $251
million by 1:20 p.m. and had plummeted to $75 million when he
punched his computer keys. But it recovered to $120 million by
day's end. His shares were worth $5.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, the Goodwill Games _ a 15-sport spectacle starring
1,500 athletes from 60 countries _ are affordable, a minor item for
a $13.3 billion corporation. They were affordable before the Turner
Broadcasting System merged with Time Warner in October 1996. They
remain affordable now.
</P>
<P>
   And what's $109 million when you're ending the Cold War? ``Yeah,
we helped end the Cold War,'' he said, leaning perilously far back
in his chair and distractedly watching the Mets-Braves game on a
corner TV. ``It's hard to tell what's the first straw or the last.
You can't get too much goodwill.''
</P>
<P>
   There will certainly be more. Saturday at Madison Square Garden,
Turner will announce the site for the 2001 Goodwill Games, which is
expected to be in Asia or Australia. The usual four-year cycle is
being shortened once to avoid future conflicts for the attention of
viewers and advertisers with the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Why does Turner keeping staging them? The Soviet Union is dead.
The United States won the Cold War. The truth is, he likes them.
They're not as big as the Olympics, but so what? He'll still
broadcast them in 130 countries. They will fill 47 hours on the TBS
Superstation, plus 10 on CBS and 8 on HBO.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't caused trouble,'' he said. ``How can getting
athletes on the field more often be bad?''
</P>
<P>
   And by paying prize money of $5 million, plus bonuses for world
records, he has lured Michael Johnson, Dan O'Brien, Michelle Kwan
and other world-class athletes. Ten athletes are being paid
six-figure fees to promote the games.
</P>
<P>
   The Goodwill Games are as much a pampered Turner scion as Cable
News Network, the Atlanta Braves or his new 24-hour ``Cold War''
series on TBS. He insisted that Time Warner never tried to axe the
Goodwill Games in the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't lay down the law,'' said Turner, who owns 10 percent
of the company but is second in command to the chairman, Gerald
Levin. ``I'm not the big dog. But we were already committed to
doing this in New York, and Jerry was excited. It's like it was
predestined for New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Schiller, the president of Turner Sports, said: ``He
really feels it's very good programming, with the sports that have
the most interest with the public. He thinks it's an event you can
put in places where the Olympics don't fit. And he loves the idea
of being in the biggest city.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wussler, the former president of Turner Broadcasting,
helped create the first Goodwill Games in Moscow in 1986. It
included the first competition between American and Soviet athletes
since the United States boycotted the 1980 Summer Olympics in
Moscow and the Soviets boycotted the 1984 Los Angeles Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something he created,'' Wussler said. ``It's his child
and he wants to continue it forever if possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Goodwill Games' impact on the Olympics will be long debated.
Turner brought the superpowers together when the Olympics couldn't.
If the Goodwill Games did not exist, would the boycotting nations
have gotten together in Seoul in 1988?
</P>
<P>
   Richard Pound, a member of the International Olympic Committee,
said: ``They've had any impact at all. If there ever was a use for
them, that time has past. They're just a made-for-TV Olympics.''

TIGERS BEAT CONE AND YANKEES, 3-1 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The New York Yankees could average about two victories
a week the rest of the season and still make the playoffs. Now the
guiding force behind most of manager Joe Torre's decisions will be
what's best for the Yankees in October.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing David Cone to succeed or fail in the eighth inning
against Detroit Thursday night, as Torre did, injects Cone with the
knowledge that his manager has confidence in him, and maybe that
will benefit the Yankees in the postseason. Thursday night, Cone
allowed a tie-breaking single to Luis Gonzalez with two outs in the
eighth and the Yankees lost, 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's Brian Moehler threw eight and one-third innings to
become only the second pitcher to beat the Yankees twice this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Torre should have replaced Cone with the left-hander Mike
Stanton as the left-handed-hitting Gonzalez came to bat. Maybe not.
A debate team could probably win arguing either side. But it's all
about the big picture now with the Yankees, a byproduct of their
67-22 record. Any mental edge derived from Torre's decisions far
outweighs a loss that very likely will be meaningless to the
American League East standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was nice, because it told me that he trusted me,'' said
Cone, who lost for the first time since June 19. ``It gives me
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre said: ``What I like to do with starters is give them a
chance to win. But they deserve a chance to lose, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The near inevitability of a Yankee playoff appearance is why
Torre may decide to rest Darryl Strawberry, who has a sore left
knee, for the next two weeks. On Sunday, Torre did not use Paul
O'Neill to pinch-hit for the rookie Ricky Ledee in the ninth inning
of a tie game, primarily because Torre wants Ledee to adapt to
pressure situations _ such as he may face in October.
</P>
<P>
   Cone (13-3) is Torre's ace, the soul of his pitching staff.
Torre says he believes in Cone ``as much as I believe in anybody,''
adding, ``I trust his heart, basically.''
</P>
<P>
   After seeing Cone work and struggle and eventually succeed in
his comeback from shoulder surgery, Torre wants Cone to feel this
trust.
</P>
<P>
   Cone allowed only five hits in the first seven innings; his
fastball was sizzling once again, his command excellent. His only
mistake had been throwing a high fastball to Raul Casanova in the
fifth inning that Casanova blasted into the right-field stands.
That tied the score at 1-1, matching a home run to lead off the
game by Chuck Knoblauch.
</P>
<P>
   But with one out in the eighth, Damion Easley, who had struck
out in his first three at-bats, worked the count to 3-2. Cone
thought about throwing Easley a fastball, but each of his
strikeouts had come with a sidearm slider _ the laredo, Cone
sometimes calls it. Cone came with the slider over the plate, and
Easley lined a double to left, directly at Ledee, and then over his
head.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton was warming up in the bullpen, a left-hander preparing
to possibly face the next three hitters _ the left-handed-hitting
Bobby Higginson, the switch-hitting Tony Clark and
left-handed-hitting Gonzalez. Torre said, however, that Stanton was
more of a contingency, in case Cone tired quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Cone zipped a 3-2 fastball over the inside corner to strike out
Higginson, and both he and Joe Girardi thought at that moment that
they were going to get out of the inning. There were two outs.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, 0 for 20 in his career against Cone, went to a 3-2 count,
and again Cone thought about trying to throw a fastball inside.
Cone tried a clider instead and missed with it, walking Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez walked to the plate, Torre stayed in the dugout. Cone
threw a splitter that dived low and away, and Gonzalez managed to
pull a ground ball to the right side. An out, Cone thought for an
instant. He was wrong. Knoblauch, the second baseman, noted that
this ground ball never hit the grass _ it hit the dirt in front of
home plate, bounced over the grass that surely would have slowed it
and then skipped on the infield dirt and into right field.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill, trying desperately to cut down Easley at the plate,
threw high and away, and Clark followed Easley across home with
Detroit's third run. Gonzalez's hit was the first with runners in
scoring position against a Yankee pitcher in 30 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, there was no lamenting, no anger. They just got beat,
Cone said, by a team that played better. ``It sounds like a
cliche,'' he said, ``but it's true in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly with Moehler, regarded as a solid but unspectacular
pitcher who throws sinkers and sliders. From the on-deck circle,
Chad Curtis said, Moehler is the type of pitcher about whom a
hitter thinks: ``O.K., as soon as he makes a mistake, I'm going to
get him. But he's not making very many mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   On only five occasions this year has an opposing starter allowed
one run in eight or more innings to the Yankees. Moehler (10-5) has
done it twice now. ``It was nerve-wracking,'' he said, ``but lots
of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   He had beaten Cone, a Cy Young Award candidate, and earned
well-deserved bragging rights for a day. But Torre is probably more
concerned that Cone win bragging rights against Chuck Finley or
Jaret Wright in the fall.

INDIAN COMMUNITY SAYS RULING WILL FORCE AGREEMENT ON SLOT MACHINES
</HEADLINE>
 RIVER-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL SOWERS 
 and VICTORIA HARKER 
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A long-awaited ruling Thursday by the Arizona Supreme Court is
being hailed as a victory by the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian
Community, which says the justices' decision will force the state
to allow lucrative slot machines on its reservation near
Scottsdale's border.
</P>
<P>
   ``It clearly requires the governor to sign a standard form of
compact with a tribe that doesn't have a compact,'' said Philip
Shea, the tribe's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   But Gov. Jane Hull had made no decision Thursday to sign an
agreement, saying instead she will meet with tribal officials to
discuss the high court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not saying whether we will sign or not sign the
compact,'' said Francie Noyes, Hull's spokeswoman. ``We are saying
we will talk about it. We just have to take it one step at a
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Merna Lewis, the tribe's vice president, also said
Thursday's ruling clears the way for full-fledged gaming on its
reservation bordering Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the decision we've been waiting for,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The tribal council Thursday night passed a resolution asking
Gov. Jane Hull to sign a compact
</P>
<P>
   Scottsdale officials have said little about the neighboring
tribe's proposal to build a casino with slot machines near its
borders.
</P>
<P>
   Scottsdale Mayor Sam Campana could not be reached Thursday, but
has said earlier that the city would not interfere with the tribe's
sovereign rights to operate a gambling hall.
</P>
<P>
   The justices' ruling stemmed from the appeal of a 1997 lawsuit
brought by a northeast Phoenix couple, Paula and Alan Sears. Their
suit challenged the legality of Indian gaming in Arizona, and also
asked then Gov. Fife Symington not to sign a compact allowing the
Salt River Community to operate slot machines on its reservation
near Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   The high court was not asked to rule on the legality of gaming
on Arizona reservations, but to decide whether the Sears had
standing to bring the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The justices unanimously said that the Sears, who live two miles
from the Scottsdale border, could not prove that they had suffered
any special harm from gaming, and therefore had no standing to
bring the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The Sears had claimed in their lawsuit that a proposed casino
3.2 miles from their children's school would harm their values and
destroy tthe character of the surrounding community.
</P>
<P>
   Shea, the tribe's attorney, said that although the justices were
not asked to consider the legality of Indian gaming, their ruling
will nevertheless give the tribe the ``same gaming privaleges . . .
as the other 16 gaming tribes have had. . .,''
</P>
<P>
   But Neal Wake, the Sears' attorney, said the court's decision
does not ensure that the games will go on or that the Salt River
Community will get an agreement to open a full-blown casino.
</P>
<P>
   Wake says it is now up to Hull to bring a lawsuit challenging
the legality of casino gambling on Arizona Indian tribes.
</P>
<P>
   `` I hope Gov. Hull will decide not to disregard that serious
legal question and decide to allow the courts to resolve these
legalities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Noyes, Hull's spokeswoman, said that the governor opposes
statewide gambling, but she will follow the law in deciding whether
to sign a compact. Noyes, also said it is too early for the
governor to say whether she will bring a lawsuit to clear up the
question of Indian gaming in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   While it awaits a compact, the tribe in June, opened a 42-table
poker room at 92nd Street and McKellips Road in order to cash in on
gaming revenues. The tribe does not have a compact for poker, but
has agreed to allow the state to oversee its games.

HEAT RECORDS WILTING AWAY THROUGHOUT L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DEBORAH SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Suburban Chatsworth became the hottest spot in
Los Angeles with a record-breaking peak of 108 degrees, as a
blistering heat wave broke area records and filled the air with
choking smog. And it isn't going to get any better for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Chatsworth's Thursday scorcher broke the 1980 record by six
degrees. Nearby Burbank's 103 shattered a 62-year-old record, while
suburban Simi Valley's 100 reading beat the 1977 record by 3
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures will remain scalding today through Tuesday, with
highs in the suburban San Fernando Valley expected to be in the
upper 90s to 108, the National Weather Service said.
</P>
<P>
   The scorching heat wave sent power use soaring as air
conditioners were running at full blast all day. But outdoors,
there was no escape from the blistering heat or the smog.
</P>
<P>
   Local hospitals and senior citizen homes reported no
heat-related deaths or cases of heatstroke, but Steve Kishineff,
emergency room physician at Providence St. Joseph Medical Center in
suburban Burbank, said he has seen about 10 percent more
respiratory problems than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any extreme weather changes affect people with respiratory
problems, like asthma and emphysema patients,'' Kishineff said.
``So I think it causes us to see higher volumes of asthma and
emphysema patients, and those we do see have more severe illness.''
</P>
<P>
   Their ailments might be related not only to the heat, but to
pollutants that accumulate in the warm, stagnant air.
</P>
<P>
   The South Coast Air Quality Management District issued health
advisories for the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys Thursday,
warning schools to keep students from vigorous and prolonged
outdoor activity and alerting people with heart or lung disease to
stay inside altogether.
</P>
<P>
   A pollution index that measures ozone, carbon monoxide and
particulates reached 175 in the eastern San Fernando Valley, 150 in
the West Valley and 163 in the Santa Clarita Valley, said AQMD
spokesman Sam Atwood. Anything over 100 is considered unhealthful,
and a level of 200 triggers a worst-case Stage 1 smog alert.
</P>
<P>
   Residents responded by cranking their air conditioners, pushing
up power use throughout the Southland. Peak power use at both
Southern California Edison and the Los Angeles Department of Water
and Power rose above average, but didn't break any records.
</P>
<P>
   The oppressive heat comes from a high-pressure zone that moved
across the southern United States with easterly trade winds,
sparking wildfires in Florida, killing more than 50 people and now
settling over the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   While the weather pattern itself is fairly common during the
summer, its results are more extreme than usual this year.
</P>
<P>
   The high-pressure area centered over Lake Mead on Thursday, said
James Murakami, staff meteorologist with the atmospheric sciences
department at UCLA. There it forced hot air downward, further
warming and compressing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The analogy is something like a bicycle pump: When you pump it
downward it causes warming of the pump,'' Murakami said. ``Another
analogy is a pressure cooker. It's the increased pressure that
causes the warming.''
</P>
<P>
   Air circulating clockwise around the high-pressure zone sweeps
heated desert air west into the Los Angeles area, Murakami said.
</P>
<P>
   And while cool ocean air is keeping the coast from scorching,
that marine layer is too shallow to clear the Santa Monica
Mountains, leaving the San Fernando Valley without relief.
</P>
<P>
   The high-pressure zone's westward shift did provide some respite
to drought- and fire-stricken Florida, allowing rain to dampen some
of the blazes, Murakami said. However, Texas remains besieged by
heat.
</P>
<P>
   At least 25 people in Texas, 20 in Louisiana, six in Oklahoma
and one each in California and Arizona have died from heat-related
causes since mid-May. Many of those killed had heart disease or
another medical condition.
</P>
<P>
   The heat wave comes in a warmer-than-average year for Los
Angeles. Normally the city averages 63 degrees, said Ken Reeves, a
senior meteorologist for AccuWeather. This year it has averaged 65
degrees.

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, July 17:
</P>
<P>
   Unless Chief Justice William Rehnquist intervenes, Secret
Service officers, including the head of President Clinton's
protective detail, will be required to testify before the Monica
Lewinsky grand jury. A federal appeals court ruled Thursday that
the testimony was required under law, but allowed the Justice
Department 24 hours in which to ask Rehnquist to schedule a hearing
before the full Supreme Court in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The main thrust of the appeals court's unanimous ruling, though,
was that Secret Service agents, as sworn law officers, should
testify and could do so without endangering presidential security.
We continue to believe the panel was correct in rejecting the
Clinton administration's invention of a new ``protective function''
privilege to block Secret Service testimony. To allow law
enforcement officials broad leeway to avoid cooperating with a
criminal inquiry cuts aganst the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   The court's ruling, however, if it stands, puts a heavy burden
on Kenneth Starr, the Special Prosecutor, to use good judgment in
calling Secret Service agents. Starr should remember that sooner or
later everyone will know whether he had sufficient reason to go to
the heart of the presidential detail and call Clinton's chief
bodyguard, Larry Cockell. If he is calling this agent as a means of
getting testimony about overheard conversations between Clinton and
his private lawyers, that would be an unacceptable attempt to
pierce attorney-client privilege. The White House has tried to
extend that privilege into inappropriate areas, but there is no
question that Clinton has a right to confidential conversations
with his personal lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The federal courts have ruled correctly that Starr has the right
to compel Secret Service testimony. For the moment, it is
impossible to know from the outside whether Starr's investigative
needs justify reaching so deeply into the Secret Service. But he
can provide reassurance that he understands his duty by announcing
now that he is not trying to get at conversations between Clinton
and his private lawyers. He should also make clear his
understanding that his threshold for summoning members of the
president's closest detail should be high, and any questions put to
agents should be focused on carefully developed areas of
investigation.

COWBOYS START FRESH IN NEW TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
 (lh) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ This is what happens to the Dallas
Cowboys when their play on the field is finally as bad their
behavior off it: They get a new sheriff and are plopped down in a
new frontier for training camp.
</P>
<P>
   The new law is the organized and disciplined Chan Gailey,
formerly the Pittsburgh Steelers' offensive coordinator, who
replaces Barry Switzer. The new training camp is in this sweltering
town of 100,000 near the Oklahoma border, which was resourceful
enough to build a 54-foot cascade to replace its namesake natural
falls after they were washed away in a flood. It took 100 years,
but they did it.
</P>
<P>
   But Wichita Falls is also tradition-bound enough to treasure a
56-year-old barbecue joint called the Bar L Drive In, which
delivers succulent ribs curbside along with a pitcher of its
specialty drink _ a beer-and-tomato-juice concoction called Red
Draw _ all for under $11.
</P>
<P>
   The coach and community could both be excused for feeling like
afterthoughts. Cowboys' owner Jerry Jones took weeks and romanced
several suitors, including former 49ers coach George Siefert and
former UCLA coach Terry Donohue, before plucking Gailey out of
nowhere to turn around a team that was 6-10 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Wichita Falls grabbed its host role only after Austin,
the longtime incumbent, decided not to ask the Cowboys back after
players trashed the dormitories at a local college at the end of
last summer's camp. Next, San Antonio decided that Dallas' unruly
players were more trouble than they were worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fresh start, so we have a lot of optimism,'' defensive
tackle Chad Hennings said after a spirited running session Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, opening day was filled with a bonhomie veteran Cowboys
professed not to have seen in years.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Leon Lett spoke briefly to the news media while
his teammates meowed behind him, stunned that the normally
reclusive Big Cat was going public.
</P>
<P>
   Deion Sanders, the cornerback formerly known as Prime Time who
now preaches prayer time, showed that his religious conversion had
not dampened his theatrical flair. Though he still is recovering
from arthroscopic surgery on a left ankle injured while playing
racquetball, Sanders heard from his teammates as he tooled to the
cafeteria for lunch in his own customized golf cart. Jet black,
with a hard top and the words ``Full Time'' on its front, the cart
features a sound system that can be heard for blocks. In heavy
rotation was a gospel number with the repeated chorus, ``Prime
time.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Cowboys finally took the practice field at Midwestern
State University, they succumbed to Gailey's influence. He put them
through a series of crisp drills in shorts and helmets, unwilling
to throw them into the 102-degree heat with full pads.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not tried to be overbearing with this football team,''
said quarterback Troy Aikman, who has become Gailey's biggest fan.
``He's provided direction, and the guys are responding to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Off the field, Gailey says the Cowboys must take care of
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people go off on their own tangents, my job is to get them
back in step,'' he said. ``If there's a problem, I'll take care of
it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the next four weeks, Gailey has many decisions to make. The
Cowboys need to choose among Ernie Mills, Billy Davis, Macey Brooks
and Stepfret Williams for the receiver slot opposite Michael Irvin.
They signed Everett McIver, who played guard for the Dolphins, to
shore up an aging offensive line; the veteran Nate Newton showed up
60 pounds lighter, but at 36 is no lock to keep his starting job at
the other guard. And Seattle's Chris Warren was ostensibly signed
as a third-down back, but is here to challenge Emmitt Smith.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Wichita Falls has vowed to take care of its
high-profile guests. To a point. More than 15,000 people welcomed
the team with a pep rally Tuesday night, and a party atmosphere
reigns in a town projected to garner $4 million from the Cowboys'
four-week stay.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the Bar L, however, Sunshine Payne is keeping her feet
firmly on the ground. For 22 years, she has tended bar and served
everyone from movie stars like Cybill Shepherd to just good folks
from down the road in Boyd. She's a Dallas fan and is certain the
players will find their way to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day the paper had a little line asking if you'd seen
your favorite Cowboy with a plate a ribs at the Bar L. They worded
it just right _ they didn't say `Dallas.' Just Cowboys. We get a
lot of them in here,'' she said with a wink.
</P>
<P>
   Tough camp. Tough town.

RANGERS DUMP STRUGGLING RANGERS, 9-3

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Right-hander Aaron Sele positioned the
Rangers for a potential venture into unchartered territory: One
week between victories.
</P>
<P>
   That became a distinct possibility after the Rangers sustained
their fifth consecutive defeat with last night's 9-3 submission to
the Baltimore Orioles at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Sele's departure after 4 1/3 innings represented only the second
time this season that the Rangers lost consecutive games started by
Sele and right-hander Rick Helling through their 40 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five days ago,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said, ``we were
kings.''
</P>
<P>
   The rotation abdicated the throne.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers starting pitchers will enter tonight's game 0-5 with an
11.51 earned-run average during this five-game losing streak, and
that does not bode well after the events of the past two evenings.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers lost consecutive games with Sele and Helling
starting previously June 28 and 30, and that contributed to their
season-high, six-game losing streak June 27-July 3. A seven-game
losing streak remains realistic with left-hander Darren Oliver and
right-hander Todd Van Poppel scheduled to pitch tonight and
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver owns an 8.47 earned-run average during his past nine
starts, and Van Poppel's 8.84 ERA during four starts with the
Rangers does nothing to improve their prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Rangers' only grace might be the fact that the
expansion Tampa Bay Devil Rays, the American League's worst team,
open a three-game series tonight at The Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seems like everything is uphill right now,'' Oates
said. ``We'll get over that. We'll start downhill again.''
</P>
<P>
   Sele (12-5) struggled to throw strikes consistently and issued
three walks during this 106-pitch appearance, and the Orioles
amassed 12 hits against the right-hander when he did throw strikes.
</P>
<P>
   At no time did Sele labor as he did during the Orioles' four-run
third inning. Sele required 39 pitches to complete that inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough when you do that,'' Oates said. ``I don't know how
long our defense was on on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Orioles catcher Lenny Webster, who matched his single-game best
for the second consecutive night with three base hits, delivered
the most significant blow with a two-out, two-run double that gave
the Orioles a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to go out there and give your team a chance to win,
and I couldn't do it,'' said Sele, who hung a curveball to Webster.
``I couldn't get the ball down right out of the chute. I was trying
to make an adjustment, and I couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Eric Gunderson, who relieved Sele, gave the Rangers
an opportunity to rally. Gunderson retired the first eight hitters
he faced, but the Rangers managed to score only once on a
seventh-inning, run-scoring single by second baseman Mark McLemore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not playing well enough,'' Oates said, ``to win right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Will that last for a week?

NEW OFFENSE SO POWERFUL, SO MYSTERIOUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ He came over the fence back at Valley
Ranch after a minicamp session one night this off-season, his eyes
glazed and his skin pale and sweating.
</P>
<P>
   He was just a fan, he mumbled to paramedics called to the scene
by a passing motorist, but he'd spent three grueling days secretly
watching new Cowboys head coach Chan Gailey installing the team's
high-tech, multiple-offensive system.
</P>
<P>
   It was more, he swore, than any human being should have to
absorb, which, by the way, may explain Nate Newton's drastic weight
loss.
</P>
<P>
   They rushed the poor survivor away _ for observation, they said
_ before he could be fully interviewed and his secret, the
unbelievable things he saw in those 72 hours of sheer hell,
disappeared with him.
</P>
<P>
   Until yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, with apparently no thought to the damage that might
have been incurred by hundreds of women and children on hand to
watch the Cowboys' first-ever preseason practice session at
Midwestern State University, Gailey and his offensive coaches again
cracked the lid on what could be the most potent force since
scientists built the first A-bomb at a secret laboratory in New
Mexico more than half a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the third time now we've started all over with the
thing,'' Gailey calmly confessed afterward, bringing gasps from
veteran members of the media corps, who found themselves wishing
they'd brought along their old gas masks from the last Middle East
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   What, we timidly asked Gailey, has he named this electrifying
offense, this dark force from the bowels of hell? Something sexier,
surely, than the mundane, no longer chic, ``West Coast Offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Desert Storm II?
</P>
<P>
   The Sound and the Fury?
</P>
<P>
   Nukes 'R Us?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no names,'' Gailey said grinning. ``No names.''
</P>
<P>
   So, it's the No-Name Offense. And instant, certain destruction
to whatever defense stands in its way.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's the way it's drawn up.
</P>
<P>
   It is an intriguing mystery, this Gailey offense, more
complicated, to hear players tell it, than Egyptian hieroglyphics,
more potent than a pitcher of Esparza's margaritas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Multiple. Balanced. Those are probably the two words I would
use to describe it,'' Gailey said. ``Nothing is set in concrete in
this offense except that we are going to try to run the football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than that, we're going to try to get the best players on
the field and get the ball into the hands of the players who need
to have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't let his calm demeanor fool you. If this works like Gailey
thinks it can, he'll be more famous than Oppenheimer (the dude who
built the A-bomb).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to force defenses to prepare for a lot more than
they've had to in the past,'' fullback Daryl Johnston said. ``It's
a little bit more complex. It's a multiple-set, multiple-formation
offense that people aren't going to be able to just walk in on a
few of the basic things that we're doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have the same personnel in different formations. You
can bring in different personnel and put them in different
formations. It's going to give our opponents a lot to look at, a
lot to consider, on a weekly basis and at the beginning of the
season they aren't going to be sure what we're going to be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Question is, are the Cowboys? This may not be brain surgery, but
then we're not dealing with a dorm full of Rhodes Scholars either.
That's why Gailey and his staff took the offense back to square one
_ for the third time _ yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't pick up where we left off'' from the last minicamp,
Gailey said. ``We went back and started back at the very beginning
and you could tell that. We got some timing and some work to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're getting it slowly but surely. They understood it. They
were able to move along quicker today than we were the first two
times we put it in. This was how we wanted to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   It'll be similar to what the Steelers ran last season, but with
some interesting Cowboys twists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, people are going to be looking at the Pittsburgh
Steeler films and trying to gauge what we're going to take from
that and what Chan's going to put in on his own,'' Johnston said.
``I think it's going to give us an advantage early when teams are
trying to decide what we're going to do. It's going to be much more
difficult to prepare for us as an offense than it has in the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   That won't matter a bit, however, if the players don't execute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said it all along, what we did in the past was very
successful for us and I'm a huge fan of the offensive system that
we ran,'' quarterback Troy Aikman said. ``I don't think it was the
offensive system that caused our problems. If we don't execute this
year any better than what we did last year, then we're going to
have the same problems in this one that we had in the old one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes beyond that. We've got to execute better and take care
of the little things and be a little more detail oriented than what
we've been. If we do that, we're going to be a success. It's not so
much the system. Coaches do things different ways for different
reasons, but ultimately it's football.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was something in the wind yesterday, something new
and powerful and mysterious. Those of us who were there on July 16,
1998, will remember the day when we witnessed the first unveiling
of the ultimate offense _ Gailey's No Name Offense.
</P>
<P>
   And we've lived to tell about it.
</P>
<P>
   So far.

WAVE OF SEX CRIMES HAS LAPD MARSHALING FORCES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICK McGREEVY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Police officials detailed a series of steps to
combat the surge in rape and sexual-assault crimes in Los Angeles,
including stepping up investigative efforts and using detectives
from the elite robbery-homicide unit to assist other officers.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that rapes have increased while most other crimes
are declining sharply, Chief Bernard C. Parks and other Los Angeles
Police Department officials said Thursday they are developing a new
computerized tracking system for such crimes, similar to one
already in existence for homicides.
</P>
<P>
   They said this would improve the sharing of crime-report data
among detectives in different parts of the city and make it easier
to identify patterns that might indicate a serial rapist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to share all of the information so they can connect a
rape report from Hollywood with one in North Hollywood,'' said
Capt. Jim Tatreau, commanding officer of the Robbery-Homicide
Division.
</P>
<P>
   Tatreau and Parks first discussed the concept during a Police
Commission meeting earlier this week in suburban Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a change in philosophy in the way we deal with sexual
assaults,'' Tatreau said Thursday. ``What we're responding to is a
very serious crime that deserves the best attention we can give to
it to make sure it is prosecuted very aggressively.''
</P>
<P>
   While overall violent crime in Los Angeles is down 14 percent
through July 7 compared with the same period last year, there have
been 742 rapes this year, up 8.6 percent from the 683 rapes during
the same period last year, according to the LAPD.
</P>
<P>
   In the suburban San Fernando Valley, the North Hollywood
Division has seen the biggest increase in rapes -- 60 percent for
the first six months of the year. Rapes are up 33 percent in the
Van Nuys Division for the same period and 48 percent in the
Foothill Division.
</P>
<P>
   LAPD commanders, who recently held a meeting on the surge, are
uncertain what is behind it. In most of the rape reports, the
victim knew the suspect, often as a date, spouse, friend or family
member, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the increase could be caused by the ``No Means No''
campaign, a stepped-up effort by rape crisis centers to get victims
to report their attacks, said Jane Blissert, the head prosecutor
for the District Attorney's Office's Sex Crimes Unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, it is such an underreported crime,'' she said.
``You don't know if reporting is going up or the crime is going
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Blissert and Patricia Giggans, executive director of the Los
Angeles County Commission on Assaults Against Women, said they have
been impressed with the quality of LAPD rape investigations, but
welcomed the new effort to make improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am glad to hear that they are taking it more seriously and
more diligently,'' Giggans said.
</P>
<P>
   Tatreau said the LAPD needs to improve the way investigative
data on rape cases, including suspect-profile information, are
shared by detectives from different divisions.
</P>
<P>
   That has improved somewhat with bureauwide FASTRAC meetings the
department began holding this year, at which command officers use
computer analysis to identify crime trends and share strategies and
data on problem crimes.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is still not enough communication between
detectives working in different parts of the city, Tatreau said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the LAPD is developing a citywide computer tracking
and analysis system that will allow detectives to have easier
access to information from other sex crime investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will include all of the reports citywide with more
information than we are getting now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The reports will include modus-operandi data and other facts,
such as whether the suspect had a chipped tooth or a tattoo.
``Those are the kinds of things you need,'' Tatreau said.
</P>
<P>
   In a written report to the Police Commission, Parks said Tatreau
and LAPD detectives from the San Fernando Valley and elsewhere have
met with officials of the state Department of Justice to discuss
linking the LAPD crime database with those throughout Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tracking `MO' crime trends throughout the city has
historically been accomplished via word-of-mouth, investigator
meetings, reading reports and sorting them by hand and, on a
smaller scale, computer systems,'' the report stated. ``This (new
computer) data will allow detectives to identify suspects, develop
leads, link crimes and identify MO similarities.''
</P>
<P>
   Another step requested by Parks is for the Robbery-Homicide
Division's specialized detectives in sex crimes to handle more
investigations now done by detectives assigned to geographic areas.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the shift has been caused by the effects of another
order by Parks -- to have field detectives assigned to major
assault crime desks focus on domestic violence cases, which leaves
investigators with less time for rape investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to pick up a lot more cases than in the past,''
Tatreau said of his division. ``There's a very good expertise in
(the Robbery-Homicide Division), and we have told the (divisions)
we are making ourselves available.''
</P>
<P>
   The department also is considering adding to the number of
Robbery-Homicide Division detectives assigned to handle sexual
assaults.

EDITORIAL: WAITING ON THE WEATHER 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, July 17:
</P>
<P>
   Insufferable heat has stalled over the South and Southwest,
taking out most of the Texas cotton crop and killing 16 people in
Dallas alone, 20 more in Louisiana. Oklahoma and Georgia have
declared agricultural disasters, and crops are faring little better
in South Carolina. The torrid heat, which began late last month _
literally burning its way across central and northern Florida _ has
now worked into New Mexico and Arizona. The high and low
temperature forecast in Phoenix for the next five days looks like a
lopsided NBA score: 115-88.
</P>
<P>
   The proximate causes for this heat wave are easy enough to
analyze. An unusually deep-reaching jet stream blocked the normal
pattern of precipitation, and now for the last few weeks a
high-pressure system, like a lens of clear air, has dominated the
region, preventing the entrance of weather that might have brought
relief.
</P>
<P>
   Yet proximate cause is not cause enough, somehow, when the
weather is this extreme. Though El Nino has passed, its effects
still linger. A mild, wet winter built up the fuel that torched
Florida. Global warming is best understood as an incremental
increase in atmospheric temperature measured as an average over a
long span of time, not as a sudden flattening blast of heat. Yet
who has been able to put global warming out of mind since the brush
fires began in Florida?
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologists say that this week is usually the hottest of the
year in our hemisphere, because temperature lags behind the sun,
now nearly 30 days past the summer solstice. Each day takes the sun
a little lower in the sky. But none of this is consolation to
residents of the South and Southwest. The only consolation that
matters to them right now is a long cool rain, a merciful breeze,
and the courage to rebuild houses and to repair a parched and
battered cropland.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, July 17:
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the Cold War, Americans have not had to worry
much about a missile attack on the United States. This week a
bipartisan commission concluded that North Korea, Iran and Iraq
could obtain long-range missiles significantly sooner, and with far
less warning, than current intelligence analyses project. The
commission's view deserves serious consideration. But it should not
set off a scramble to mount a new, nationwide missile defense
system, as many Republicans now advocate.
</P>
<P>
   The panel included missile defense enthusiasts, but also several
arms control advocates. Its unanimous conclusions flowed from
evidence, much of it classified, showing ambitious missile
development programs in several nations and extensive Russian and
Chinese help to strategic and commercial clients. It also cited
widespread availability of old Russian and American missile designs
and the ability of some countries to hide weapons development work
from American intelligence satellites.
</P>
<P>
   The commission concluded that America could not rule out the
possibility that North Korea and Iran might be able to launch
long-range missiles within 5 years and that Iraq might do so in 10
years. The CIA, which has looked at much the same evidence,
suggested that the commission's estimates are based on unrealistic,
worst-case assumptions and that with the possible exception of
North Korea, no new countries could mount a long-range missile
threat before 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the threat turns out to be more imminent, the technology
for long-range missile defenses is still experimental. Considerably
more testing and evaluation will be needed before a reliable
defensive system could be built. The Clinton administration's plan
to proceed only with research programs for the next two years is
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Washington must also be wary of the hidden diplomatic costs of
moving directly to construction, even if a workable system is
devised. Doing so would require changes in the 1972 treaty with
Moscow that bans most long-range defensive missiles. Treaty changes
would have to be negotiated in a way that does not interfere with
continuing efforts to reduce Russian and American nuclear arsenals.
Russia's thousands of unneeded thermonuclear warheads are a
frightening invitation to theft, diversion and accident. America
needs to prepare for tomorrow's dangers, but not at the expense of
ignoring today's.

ROBERT G. DAVIS, 90, PROFESSOR OF ENGLISH AND LITERARY CRITIC
</HEADLINE>

 By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Gorham Davis, a prolific literary critic and a professor
emeritus of English at Columbia University, died Thursday at the
Vernon Hall Nursing Home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 90 and lived in
Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was the author of influential studies of John Dos Passos,
C.P. Snow and James Farrell, and he wrote regularly for The New
York Times Book Review, Partisan Review, Commentary and the
American Scholar. He also wrote short stories that appeared in The
New Yorker and was the winner of an O'Henry Award for one of them.
Davis was the editor of an anthology of short stories, ``Ten Modern
Masters,'' and a companion volume, ``Ten Masters of the Modern
Essay,'' which were widely used as texts by college students.
</P>
<P>
   As a young professor at Harvard, Davis had as students John
Simon and Norman Mailer, and it was he who encouraged Mailer to
submit his first short story to Story magazine. The story won the
annual college prize.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also taught at Smith College, in Northampton, Mass., where
one of his students, he said, was Sylvia Plath.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was born in Cambridge in 1908. His father was a banker,
and the family traced its roots in Massachusetts to the landing of
the Mayflower. His grandfather was a Salem sea captain, and among
his forebears was Obed Brooks, a founder of the Brooks Academy, now
the Brooks Museum, in Harwich, Mass. Davis graduated from Harvard
College in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, the writer, Hope Hale Davis, he is
survived by a daughter, Lydia, of Port Ewen, N.Y.; a son, Stephen,
of New York, and four grandchildren.

BONILLA COULD RETURN TO DL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Dodgers left fielder Bobby Bonilla could become the
next player headed to the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla, who already spent two weeks on the DL with an
intestinal infection (June 17-July 3), has developed tendinitis in
his left wrist.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla had an X-ray and an MRI exam on the wrist Thursday in
Los Angeles. It became swollen after Tuesday night's game against
San Francisco and doctors have placed it in a protective cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say he's going on the DL, but it looks like
that could happen,'' general manager Tom Lasorda said. ``One thing
is certain, he will not be joining us here in St. Louis.''
</P>
<P>
   If he goes on the DL, Bonilla would join second baseman Eric
Young, shortstop Jose Vizcaino, pitcher Ramon Martinez and left
fielder Todd Hollandsworth.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla, 35, underwent surgery on his left wrist during the
off-season. Doctors said a full recovery would take about a year.
Bonilla also had surgery last winter to repair a torn left Achilles
tendon.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla is batting just .202 since joining the Dodgers on May 15
with one homer and 16 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits: Since getting hits in his first two at-bats Sunday,
first baseman Eric Karros has gone 1 for 15.... After starting the
Dodgers' past 21 games, catcher Charles Johnson was given the night
off. Johnson batted just .160 on the last homestand. He was rested
because the team didn't arrive in St. Louis until 4 a.m. Thursday.
Tom Prince started behind the plate and went 2 for 4 with a double
and run scored.... Former Dodgers second baseman Delino DeShields
is out of the Cardinals' lineup after undergoing arthroscopic
surgery last week on his left knee. DeShields, tied for the NL lead
with seven triples, is due back in early August....
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to get No. 3 hitter Mark McGwire more RBI chances,
St. Louis manager Tony LaRussa has been batting his pitcher eighth
and a position player ninth the past eight games. Since the move,
McGwire is 5 for 23 with three of his pace-setting 40 homers and
five RBI.... Speaking of McGwire and his record home-run pace, ESPN
is in town filming a documentary about all-time single-season
home-run champ Roger Maris, who ended his career with the Cardinals
in 1968.

DRIVERS IN NO HURRY TO QUALIFY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE RAMIREZ  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ Anything can happen in racing ... or it sure
seemed that way Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 32 cars entered in Saturday's California 200, only five
made qualifying attempts during Bud Pole qualifying that was marred
by 135-degree track temperature at California Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Harwick, who was the second car out, set the pole with a
lap of 173.779 mph. Scott Gaylord, 17th in order to qualify but the
fifth and final car out, was second at 172.410 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Rauchman, Dean Wanless and Mike Starr were the only other
cars to make attempts and will start third through fifth,
respectively. The remaining 27 cars failed to meet NASCAR Winston
West's five-minute rule and were placed in starting order per 1998
owners points, career owner victories and entry postmarks.
</P>
<P>
   Under Winston West rules, each entry has five minutes to take
the track after the preceding competitor finishes his qualifying
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Defending series champion Butch Gilliland, whose team is based
in Glendora, was placed 11th. Points leader Sean Woodside of Saugus
will start seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like it,'' said Kevin Green, NASCAR
Winston West director of public relations. ``In essence, (each
competitor) knew that there were 32 cars trying to make a 36-car
field. Everybody was in the show. So essentially, they were just
standing on their times and using (Thursday's) practice to get
ready for Saturday's race.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilliland didn't exactly agree with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were ready, we were in line,'' Gilliland said. ``I think
with the heat, the two hours of practice, everybody had to work on
the cars a little bit for qualifying. What it is is that (NASCAR)
is trying to run three shows here in a weekend, and it's too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what it is, too, is that NASCAR was flexing their
muscles. They were saying, `If you're not up in line to qualify,
you don't qualify.'''
</P>
<P>
   With temperatures expected to be above or near Thursday's
reading of 103 degrees throughout the weekend, fans attending the
event are advised to drink plenty of liquids and get in the shade
whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is to drink fluids, fluids and more fluids,''
said Dr. Greg Baumann, physician for Penske Motorsports.
</P>
<P>
   Sprague gets sponsor: NASCAR Craftsman Trucks points-leader Jack
Sprague has obtained sponsorship for the remainder of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Sprague's No.24 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet S-10 will receive
backing from GMAC with a blue and white paint scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Sprague, the 1997 NASCAR Trucks series champion, has finished in
the top 10 at that past 11 events held on a speedway. His last
non-top 10 on a track of one mile or longer came at Texas Motor
Speedway on June 6, 1997, when he finished 31st after suffering a
blown engine.
</P>
<P>
   Sprague, who finished 10th at Nazareth (Pa.) last week, begins
the weekend with a 26-point lead over Ron Hornaday.
</P>
<P>
   Home sweet home: Todd Bodine, recently released from ISM
Racing's Winston Cup team, will drive the No.30 Slim Jim Chevrolet
Monte Carlo for Team 34 at this weekend's Busch Grand National
Kenwood 300.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going home again to Team 34,'' said Bodine, who won the
inaugural Busch event at Fontana last season. ``Throughout my
career, (co-owners) Scott Welliver and Frank Cicci have there for
me when I've needed a place to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited to know that I'll be back in such familiar
surroundings and with a team where each and every week I'll have
cars capable of winning.''
</P>
<P>
   HRs and race cars: Mark McGwire and five other major-league
baseball players are owners of the Chevrolet Monte Carlo driven by
Bobby Hillin in Sunday's Busch race.
</P>
<P>
   Fans attending today's Busch qualifying and Sunday's race can be
kept up to date with McGwire's pursuit of Roger Maris' home-run
record. The rear deck lid and lower quarter panels of Hillin's car
will display McGwire's current home run total and change each time
he adds to it.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Can one imagine Leonard Bernstein as a corn-fed
innocent arriving wide-eyed in the big city? I don't think so. But
that image is the springboard for John Neumeier's ``Bernstein
Dances,'' the tedious but not entirely hopeless dance treatment of
Bernstein's life and art that the Hamburg Ballet presented on
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The two-and-a-half-hour production, first performed in Germany
last month, was given its U.S. premiere at the New York State
Theater as part of the Bernstein Celebration within Lincoln Center
Festival '98.
</P>
<P>
   That Neumeier intended the work, which he calls a ballet revue,
as a tribute to Bernstein, is a given. With acolytes like this, who
needs critics?
</P>
<P>
   Hopes are dashed early on that Neumeier can place Bernstein the
man within his music in the way that Frederick Ashton did so
profoundly with Arthur Rimbaud in his ballet ``Illuminations,'' set
to Benjamin Britten's music. In the Ashton ballet, one saw the
artist wandering within his art, thanks to a poet-choreographer's
comment on poetry through metaphor, symbol and image and not
without reference to the so-called sordid.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, complexity is equated with simplicity in ``Bernstein
Dances.'' Despite a shrewd use of Bernstein's symphonic and popular
music, Neumeier fails to comment on the urban sophistication of
that music and the cosmopolitan influences that informed
Bernstein's life and his work as a composer and conductor.
</P>
<P>
   To identify the protagonist with a song that tells him to go
back to Ohio, however ironic, misses the mark. But Lloyd Riggins,
in a superbly sustained performance as the Bernstein figure, is
asked to remain a naif, Harvard education notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   He even requires an angel and guide, the only character with a
name in the program credits: Eros. Ivan Urban, certainly angelic
looking with his golden curls and purity of style, takes the hero
on a journey in which he finds his true self. That is, an
accidental embrace with a young man in the beginning is
recapitulated until at the end, the hero acknowledges his
homosexuality with a prolonged male duet at a New York soiree where
mate-swapping is the norm.
</P>
<P>
   Like many biographers, Neumeier suggests that aspects of a
private life can illuminate our understanding of an artist. But he
is not a choreographer who knows how to distill the essence of
character and telegraph a basic truth. To reduce the first half of
the ballet to a character's confusion about his sexual identity is
too simple, especially in a ballet about Leonard Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   Neumeier is at his best in pure-dance works rather than
narrative ballets. ``Bernstein Dances'' falls in between, and what
could have been sharp character vignettes become drawn-out
choreographic episodes. The dancers, in multiple allegorical roles,
are impossible to sort out.
</P>
<P>
   The choreography itself is more idiosyncratic than idiomatic.
The stylized balletic versions of show dancing are too feeble to
offer a real gloss on Broadway musicals, although there is a worthy
attempt at an abstract treatment of the rumble from ``West Side
Story.'' Costumed by Giorgio Armani, the ensemble gets a big number
when the men and women in suits evoke the big city. One of the best
and liveliest ensembles has the women in purple bras under open
purple suit jackets advancing in a wedge behind Jiri Bubenicek, who
erupts into a geyser of leg beats to ``Wrong Note Rag.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty Comden and Adolph Green, who wrote the lyrics, were on
hand for the curtain calls, which were shared by the singers,
Angela Horn and Scott Cheffer, as well as Rainer Muhlbach, who
conducted the New York City Opera orchestra. Also taking a bow were
the instrumental soloists: Vadim Gluzman, whose violin solos were
important to the jagged outbursts in the composition inspired by
Plato's Symposium, ``Serenade.'' This piece was intercut by piano
solos played onstage by Sebastian Knauer, one of Riggins' alter
egos.
</P>
<P>
   The lively overture to ``Candide,'' which lifts the mood as
Riggins leads a wedge of dancers in some choreographed curtain
calls, also begins the piece.
</P>
<P>
   Riggins, as the young Bernstein in shorts, is seen slumped over
a piano. The singers sound the theme with the song ``Who Am I''
from ``Peter Pan'' as the composer's lyrics ask, ``Will I ever live
again as a rooster or a hen?'' The transcendental tinge is echoed
later by dancers in fashionable attire who drop into the lotus
position to meditate.
</P>
<P>
   Riggins, an American dancer who excelled in August
Bournonville's ballets in the Royal Danish Ballet, offers a
sensational acting and dance performance. More often than not, he
is surrounded by five others who amplify the hero's emotional life.
Heather Jurgensen is the adult woman in his life, Anna Polikarpova
and Otto Bubenicek get the awkward duets about alienation while
Jiri Bubenicek and Joelle Boulogne move the action along.
</P>
<P>
   Music from ``Facsimile,'' Jerome Robbins' 1946 ballet about a
love triangle, introduces a similar theme. Riggins kisses Ms.
Polikarpova but then finds himself in the arms of a man. Rose Gad
enters to introduce a theme of loneliness. Large in scale, Reinhart
Wolf's photographs of New York form the background as Ms. Gad, held
horizontally by Riggins, seems to levitate and then leaves him with
his arm over an empty chair.
</P>
<P>
   Selections from Bernstein's ``Mass'' attempt to introduce a
spiritual theme. In Part 2, set mostly to ``Serenade,'' the
successful artist looks back on his life. Certainly Neumeier has
ideas: There is a good touch when Ms. Gad adjusts Riggins' tie as
he stands in undershorts and evening jacket. But the last half is
drawn out: a long time to tell a tale of salvation in the city of
perdition.

EDITORIAL: BATTLE LINES ON PATIENTS' RIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, July 17:
</P>
<P>
   Congress is under heavy pressure to pass legislation governing
the operation of health maintenance organizations. Doctors have
been telling patients they are being restricted in giving care.
Patients believe that insurance bureaucrats are making medical
decisions once reserved for physicians. That is why Republicans and
Democrats in the Senate are vying to pass a patients' rights bill
before everyone becomes totally absorbed in the midterm elections.
The competing versions share some common ground, but the Republican
plan has a flawed design. It tries to placate consumer unhappiness
while causing as little inconvenience as possible for the insurance
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The voter heat behind this issue has not been lost on the
Democrats, who have been staging a form of theater in Washington.
Everyone from President Clinton to working doctors has marketed
horror stories about insensitive, profit-driven health maintenance
organizations. All this put a fire under the Republicans, who
released their Senate bill on Wednesday and a House bill Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The competing Senate plans share several core principles. Both
would require HMOs to disclose information on costs, benefits and
quality of care. Both would guarantee emergency care. But there are
two big areas where the Democratic plan is superior. The Democrats
would extend their protections to 150 million health-care
consumers, while the Republicans would limit theirs to the 48
million covered by federally regulated plans in which employers,
mainly big companies, act as their own insurers. The Republicans
argue that the rest are adequately protected by state laws. That is
a subterfuge designed to deter the needed movement toward coverage
for all Americans. The Republican bill in the House is more honest
and less stingy. It would also cover 150 million consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The other big difference involves the law. The Democrats are
insisting that patients have the right to sue HMOs and insurance
companies in state courts when medical benefits are improperly
denied. The Republicans would allow patients to appeal the denial
of benefits to a panel of experts, but would not give them a right
to take the issue to court. This is an unwarranted protection for
corporations. Doctors can be sued when they make an incorrect
medical decision. So should the insurance company that, for
example, denies essential access to a specialist.
</P>
<P>
   There are, to be sure, ways to limit malpractice costs without
sacrificing the legal rights of consumers. The Democrats might
compromise by making review by an independent panel with the power
to award damages a prerequisite to the more extreme step of a legal
suit.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has been coy on the issue, but yesterday Clinton
defended the right to sue. ``You can write all the guarantees you
want into law here in Washington,'' he said, ``and if nobody can
enforce them, the delay in the system will still cause people to
die.'' He is right to stand up for the rights of consumers, even
though the GOP will say he is in the pocket of trial lawyers.

LEGENDARY TENOR PRAISES `RENT'  
 ACTING SENATORIAL  
 GOODWILL ILL WILL  
 MILLER GIRL UPDATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES BARRON WITH JAMES DAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ That bearded man in Row F, the one with the scarf
around his neck at Thursday night's performance of the rock musical
``Rent,'' was the singer Luciano Pavarotti. He said that he was
impressed by the high-voltage show, which was inspired by a
somewhat quieter four-act tragedy he knows inside out, Puccini's
``La Boheme.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a concert of youth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that was why the bear-like tenor said that he could not
see himself in ``Rent,'' with its running, jumping cast of
struggling bohemians in the East Village.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said, with a wave of his hand as he headed backstage
to shake hands with the cast _ and a woman in a blue suit from Row
G, Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Aggression Check
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the news conference, on a steamy patch of lawn outside the
U.S. Capitol building on Wednesday, was about gun control
legislation. No, the bill being discussed would not ban shooting
from the lip at news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., was there. So was Sen. Richard
Durbin, D-Ill. So was Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who is
campaigning to go from the House to the Senate, a fact noted by
Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., who made the same journey himself
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all look forward to seeing Chuck Schumer in the Senate, but
none more than myself,'' Torricelli said. ``I unfortunately won the
recent contest for the most aggressive and verbose member of the
United States Senate. Chuck Schumer is my best chance to come in
second next year, and I'm looking forward to his arrival here.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Torricelli was referring to a recent Washingtonian
magazine survey of the best and worst congressmen, as rated by
Capitol Hill aides. Torricelli came in first in the category of
``showhorse.'' He was second in three other categories _ ``biggest
windbag,'' ``weakest spine'' and ``freshman flop'' _ and third in
``hottest temper.''
</P>
<P>
   As he finished his remarks, there were scattered chuckles and,
among aides, pained looks. Schumer did not miss a beat, though.
``That's a great speech, Bob,'' he said. ``I show new respect for
senators these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Art and Will
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was some behind-the-scenes ill will last week
about the Goodwill Games after the artist Leroy Neiman unveiled his
painting of the New York skyline, which will appear on souvenir
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Weitz, the spokesman for the Axelle Fine Arts Galerie
SoHo, a gallery at 148 Spring St., near Wooster Street, complained
that the official artist of the games was Michel Delacroix, who
unveiled a Goodwill Games greeting card Thursday night. ``The
Goodwill Games people were supposed to have called me'' before the
Neiman unveiling, Weitz said. ``They licensed out the souvenir
program to a licensee, and they chose to use Leroy Neiman on the
cover. We have the exclusive official art license for the games,
and we commissioned Michel to paint the official painting.''
</P>
<P>
   But the brouhaha had been forgotten by the time Delacroix was
joined by the actress Sarah Jessica Parker and by Carol Bellamy,
executive director of Unicef, Thursday night. Weitz said that money
from sales of the greeting card would go to Unicef.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs for the Girls
</P>
<P>
   The three ``Miller girls,'' as people still call the daughters
of the duty-free tycoon Robert Miller, now all have jobs, if you
consider being a princess a job. Pia Getty is working for her
father's new fragrance and cosmetics chain, Sephora, which opened
its first store, at 555 Broadway, near Prince Street, on Wednesday.
(Her sister Alexandra Von Furstenberg works with her mother-in-law,
the designer Diane Von Furstenberg. Marie-Chantal Miller married
Crown Prince Pavlos of Greece in 1995.)
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Getty's title at Sephora is ``creative ambassador.'' ``I'm
present at the openings of the stores,'' she said. ``We'll be
opening another 14 or 18 this year, you know, so I'll be
traveling.''

PHILLIES 4, METS 2 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Any realists affiliated with the Mets had to figure
this was coming. They had crossed their fingers, crossed their legs
and crossed their toes each time a fly ball was hit in Todd
Hundley's direction for the first three games he played left field.
But it was inevitable that, sooner or later, the catcher hiding in
the outfield would mishandle a ball and it would destroy the Mets.
It happened sooner. It happened Thursday night. More than once.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley's initial misplay occurred in the first inning, and it
turned the evening into a painful one for the Mets because they
tried to erase it during nine futile innings before succumbing to
the Phillies, 4-2, at Shea Stadium. Two Philadelphia runs scored
because of Hundley's weak judgment in left field in the first
inning, and a third one scored because his mistake kept the inning
percolating.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth run trotted in after Hundley allowed a simple fly to
nick off his glove in the eighth as he was preparing to throw home
for a possible play at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're embarrassed,'' Hundley said. ``You're saying, `Where am
I?' I actually had to look around to find out where I was. You can
put this game on me. You can lay this game on my shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   An inning later, Rico Brogna doubled into the left-field corner,
and Hundley's throw skidded by the cutoff man for an error that
allowed the runner to reach third base. No run developed, but it
hardly mattered: Hundley's miscues had done enough damage.
</P>
<P>
   So the four-game wild-card showdown between the sputtering and
grimacing Mets and the young and improved Phillies opened with
shabby play afield as well as at bat, where the Mets left 11 on
base.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 20,283 fans frequently booed the slumping Mike
Piazza; for now, Hundley was not verbally berated.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets wasted Rick Reed's exceptional effort against the
mortal Mark Portugal and four relievers as they lost for the eighth
time in the last 10 games and the 24th in the last 39 games. The
Phillies, yes, the Phillies (48-44), nudged ahead of the Mets
(46-44) into second place in the National League East and forged
ahead in the wild-card race as well.
</P>
<P>
   A single, an infield popout, a force-play groundout and a rare
walk from Reed put Phillies on first and second with two out in the
first inning. Mike Lieberthal scorched a line drive to left that
should have been the third out. But Hundley froze, then took two
steps forward. As he tried to recover and retreat on the ball,
Hundley stumbled and never even leaped for the ball as it soared
past him and bounced off the left-field fence. Scott Rolen breezed
in from second base and Brogna chugged in from first.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberthal was awarded a double because Hundley never touched
the ball. The situation was exacerbated when Bobby Abreu singled to
left to make it 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Reed (10-6) had yielded three or fewer earned runs in 13 of 18
starts; the misplay last night made him responsible for three
earned runs. Reed, however, was understanding. ``I wouldn't want to
do what he's doing,'' he said. ``He's still learning the position.
He's going to have games like these where he feels like he wants to
find a hole and crawl in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Manager Bobby Valentine: ``As long as he believes, I'll
believe. It's a tough night for him. I was hoping he wouldn't have
to go through one of those days.''
</P>
<P>
   Rey Ordonez's bloop single off Portugal (5-2) in the sixth
knocked in the only run off the Phillies' starter. The final Mets
run came on John Olerud's 10th home run in the ninth.

COLDER WATER IN PACIFIC SIGNALS RETURN OF LA NINA, HIGHER FIRE
HAZARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALEX ROTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The nation's top weather forecasters concluded
that a La Nina winter is likely, heralding less rain for Southern
California than usual -- an ominous sign for the coming wildfire
season.
</P>
<P>
   At a specially called meeting Thursday in Boulder, Colo.,
meteorologists and climatologists charted the arrival of the global
weather phenomenon, signaled by the formation of a pool of cold
Pacific water larger than California itself.
</P>
<P>
   This cooling of the ocean around the equator affects the jet
stream, changing weather worldwide. In Southern California, it
brings drier-than-usual winters rather than El Nino's
wetter-than-normal weather.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles already faces the prospect of brush fires,
firefighters say, because of the large amount of brush and grass,
grown lush with El Nino rains.
</P>
<P>
   Among the unknowns is exactly how dry this winter will be and
whether the La Nina phenomenon will have any effect on the hot,
fire-stoking Santa Ana winds.
</P>
<P>
   In the past eight La Nina years since 1950, Los Angeles received
13 percent less rainfall on average than during a normal year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, forecasters hesitate to make any predictions at this
early stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most likely scenario is that it will be slightly drier
than normal,'' said Klaus Weickmann, research meteorologist with
the Climate Diagnostics Center in Boulder.
</P>
<P>
   Others gathered for the conference agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word I've heard several times is it's incipient,'' said
Gerald Meehl, a research scientist at the National Center for
Atmospheric Research.
</P>
<P>
   And if past years are any prediction, La Nina means forest
fires.
</P>
<P>
   By studying old-growth trees and examining their growth rings,
researchers have marked a consistent history of fires over many
decades. What they have found is that fire scars on the tree rings
tend to line up with La Nina periods, said Tom Murphree, professor
of meteorology at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's certainly a good chance of increased fire danger,''
Murphree said.
</P>
<P>
   The other missing piece of the puzzle is whether the Santa Ana
winds -- the bane of Los Angeles firefighters -- will blow more
frequently this year or any stronger than usual.
</P>
<P>
   National Weather Service meteorologist Rob Krohn said a
connection between La Nina and the Santa Ana winds ``has never been
firmly established.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA meteorologist James Murakami, however, said Santa Ana winds
tend to blow more frequently in La Nina years -- although no one is
sure why.
</P>
<P>
   ``The connection behind it isn't very clear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Ana winds are caused by high-pressure systems that linger
in the desert in Utah and Nevada, pushing superheated air toward
Los Angeles and Southern California. Once these winds reach the
canyons, their speeds pick up dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the winds with dry weather and huge amounts of kindling,
and the results can be explosive. However, firefighters said
record-breaking heat hitting Los Angeles this week likely won't
accelerate the start of fire season unless the high temperatures
linger for weeks. That's because there is little wind but
relatively high humidity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all the factors stay the way they are, it's going to get a
little drier but not make much difference in a couple of days,''
said Chief Mike Wilkinson of the L.A. County Fire Department's
forestry division.

CHANA TIMONER, 46, RABBI AND CHAPLAIN, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chana Timoner, a onetime housewife with such a passionate
devotion to tradition and social justice that she became first a
rabbi and then the first Jewish woman to serve as a full-time Army
chaplain, died on Monday at her home in New Haven, Conn. She was 46
and had received a medical discharge earlier this year after
developing the Epstein-Barr virus.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Dr. Julian Timoner, a chiropractor who persuaded
state authorities to release the body without an autopsy, said he
believed that his wife had accidentally taken a fatal overdose
combination of her prescribed medication and her usual sleeping
pills.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who was surprised when Ms. Timoner, then a self-styled
housewife and couch potato, began five years of intense religious
training at age 33 or who was surprised even more when she entered
the Army and endured six weeks of grueling basic training at age
39, simply had not been paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Timoner, a New Haven native whose father was a railroad
carpenter, religion, the military and pushing limits were all
family traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Her Russian-born maternal grandfather had been a rabbi in New
Haven, and her mother had been so eager to fight the Nazis in World
War II that she joined the Canadian army in 1940, a year before the
United States entered the war and she was able to transfer to the
newly organized Women's Army Corps.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Ms. Timoner enrolled in Southern Connecticut State
College in New Haven, she had developed expansive dreams that
included later study at the Jerusalem University.
</P>
<P>
   Then she made the mistake of dropping by a local Jewish
community center one night. Dr. Timoner was there, too, and, well,
it's an old story, and by the time she began giving it her own
personal twist, Ms. Timoner had been married at 18, had had two
children by the time she graduated and had endured a
grin-and-bear-it decade as a distinctly restless housewife and
mother.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Timoner, who had always been deeply involved in religion and
who had been struggling with herself over whether to become a
rabbi, attributed her decision to begin religious studies in 1984
to a friend who told her one day: ``You know, in 7 years you could
be a 40-year-old housewife or you could be a 40-year-old rabbi.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Ms. Timoner said, ``I was on the phone,'' finding
out how to enter rabbinical training.
</P>
<P>
   She enrolled in the Academy for Jewish Religion in New York and
spent the next five years making long daily trips to New York City.
Then, after her ordination in 1989, she spent two more commuting
years studying for a doctorate at the New York Theological
Seminary, completing the course work but deferring her
dissertation.
</P>
<P>
   Although she was far from the first woman to become a rabbi,
most had been affiliated with the liberal Reform Jewish tradition,
and as a committed adherent of the more austere Conservative
tradition, Rabbi Timoner had trouble finding a post.
</P>
<P>
   Then when she did find one, as rabbi of the Beth El Synagogue in
Wallingford, Conn., her career ran afoul of her own principles.
When she refused to bend the rules to perform a bar mitzvah for a
youth with a Jewish father and a gentile mother without the
required religious circumcision ritual, she was forced to step
down.
</P>
<P>
   After working for the National Council of Christians and Jews
and as a hospital chaplain, Rabbi Timoner joined the Army Reserves
and in 1993 became the first Jewish woman to serve as a full-time
chaplain in the regular Army.
</P>
<P>
   On the day in 1993 that she began her first assignment, at Fort
Bragg, N.C., her husband recalled on Thursday, President Clinton
announced his ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy on homosexuals in
the military, prompting Rabbi Timoner to make an announcement of
her own: she would gladly provide a full range of counseling for
gay soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The position, which shocked her fellow chaplains at the base,
was simply par for the Timoner course. When she had learned that
homosexuals, even those with the AIDS virus, were being shunned by
the Jewish religious establishment in Connecticut, she formed study
groups for Jewish homosexuals and became active in AIDS
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   As the only Jewish chaplain at Fort Bragg, Rabbi Timoner held
regular Friday services for the few Jewish soldiers at the base,
but as the chaplain for a helicopter battalion there she spent most
of her time counseling the soldiers, many of them women, none of
them Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief stint in Korea, where the Epstein-Barr virus and
the related chronic fatigue syndrome were first diagnosed, Captain
Timoner completed her Army service at Fort Benning, Ga., where, as
usual, she made waves, especially when she insisted on adding
prayers for Catholic, gay and gypsy victims of the Nazi terror at a
Holocaust service.
</P>
<P>
   No one should have been surprised. After all, when Elie Wiesel
once addressed a large Jewish gathering at Yale and made an
impassioned reference to ``the six million,'' Rabbi Timoner, who
was sitting on the first row, had felt compelled to stand and chide
him for not including the other oppressed groups who died in the
gas chambers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her husband, Rabbi Timoner is survived by her
mother, Mary Surasky of Tampa, Fla.; a daughter, Aviva, of Paris; a
son, Samson, of Germantown, Md.; a sister, Abby Sawilowsky, of Oak
Park, Mich., and two brothers, Miron Surasky of Oakland, Calif.,
and Charles Surasky of Yardley, Pa.

MAHBUB UL HAQ, 64, ANALYST AND CRITIC OF GLOBAL POVERTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mahbub ul Haq, a former finance minister of Pakistan
and an early proponent of economic liberalization who in later
years argued that poor countries failed to prosper because they
neglected the basic development of their people, died Thursday in
New York. He was 64.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was pneumonia, said his son, Farhan, a
reporter for the Inter Press Service, a news agency. The elder Haq,
who was visiting New York from Pakistan, collapsed early this week
and did not respond to treatment, former colleagues said.
</P>
<P>
   Haq, who had also been a governor of the International Monetary
Fund and director of policy planning at the World Bank, was the
author of several books, including ``The Poverty Curtain''
(Columbia University Press) and ``Strategy of Economic Planning''
(Oxford University Press).
</P>
<P>
   But he is best known for his creation in 1990 of an annual Human
Development Index, a measure used by the U.N. Development Program
to measure the wealth of nations by the level of living standards
their citizens have attained.
</P>
<P>
   His views did not make him popular in many developing countries,
nor in some Western capitals, where he also criticized foreign aid
policies and domestic social programs.
</P>
<P>
   A scrappy and articulate debater, he relished the controversies
he provoked. He traveled extensively to speak and gather
information and impressions for the United Nations' annual Human
Development Report, which was built around his index.
</P>
<P>
   James Gustave Speth, administrator of the U.N. Development
Program, said, ``I don't think anybody did more or even as much as
Mahbub did to bring balance back to development thinking when
everyone else was worshipping at the altar of GNP growth.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the U.N. Development Program in 1995, Haq returned
to Pakistan to establish the Human Development Center for South
Asia with the help of his wife, Khadija Khanum, an economist.
Measures of human progress in the region, especially in India and
Pakistan, had begun to slip badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``After producing seven global Human Development Reports, I had
to face the sad reality that the real challenge to human
development lay back home, in Pakistan and South Asia,'' he said.
``South Asia has been sinking fast into a quagmire of human
deprivation and despair, emerging as the most deprived region of
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Haq, who is survived by his daughter, Toneema, as well as his
wife and son, studied at Punjab University in Pakistan, King's
College in Cambridge, Yale and Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   He was born on Feb. 22, 1934, and while still in his 20s he
became the chief economist of Pakistan's national planning
commission. In the 1980s, under the late President Mohammed Zia-ul
Haq, he served as minister of commerce, planning and finance. He
moved to Washington and the World Bank in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The founder of the Third World Forum, a panel for discussing
development issues, Haq was also an adviser to the Brandt
Commission, which looked into economic relations between the rich
and poor nations.
</P>
<P>
   In his spare time, he was a great reader of literature and
poetry. In 1985 he wrote a volume of poems titled ``An Elusive
Dawn.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I have struggled for a long time with the concept and practice
of development,'' Haq wrote in the preface to the first report on
Human Development in South Asia, in 1997. ``Emerging from the
Western citadels of learning _ Cambridge, Yale, Harvard _ in the
1950s, I was armed with the firm neoclassical conviction that the
real purpose of development was to increase national income.'' Over
half a century, he increasingly doubted that analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is widespread consensus today,'' he wrote, ``that the
purpose of development is not just to enlarge incomes but to
enlarge people's choices, and that these choices extend to a decent
education, good health, political freedom, cultural identity,
personal security, community participation, environmental security
and many other areas of human well-being.
</P>
<P>
   ``A link between growth and human lives must be created through
conscious national planning.''

MINORITY, WOMEN DIRECTORS WORKING LESS, REPORT SHOWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MELISSA SCHMITT  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Advocates for women and minorities trying to make
their way in Hollywood were outraged by a new report that shows
they are getting less and less work even as the movie and
television industry is booming.
</P>
<P>
   The $20 billion motion-picture and TV production industry added
17 percent more jobs in 1997. In 1998, the industry is expected to
have 12 percent more available, more than five times the county's
overall growth rate for jobs.
</P>
<P>
   About 3,000 of those jobs last year went to movie and TV
directors. Yet women and minorities worked 900 fewer days in 1997
than they did in 1996, according to a report released Thursday by
the Directors Guild of America.
</P>
<P>
   Those statistics elicited cries of anger from those in the
industry actively working to get more women and minorities into top
Hollywood positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very telling that some things are hard to
change,'' said Iris Grossman, president of Women in Film.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers speak for themselves. If there are men and women
out there, both of whom are qualified for the jobs, why aren't
women getting them?''
</P>
<P>
   The total number of days worked in 1997 by women film directors
dropped from 4,233 to 3,411. That's a decrease of 1.8 percent of
the total number of days worked by DGA women film directors in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Shea, president of the DGA, said he and the guild have been
working hard to solve that problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``With 3,000 more days worked, why should the women drop from
8.8 percent to 7 percent (of the total days worked)?'' Shea said
Thursday. ``That's a disastrous drop for women.''
</P>
<P>
   By pressing motion-picture companies to hire more women,
African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans and other minorities,
the DGA has made progress, Shea said, adding that it appears
studios and the guild need to do more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really need to get them out there where people can meet
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The DGA has tracked the number of minorities and women landing
directorial positions since 1983, the year the guild sued Columbia
Pictures and Warner Bros. for discriminatory hiring practices.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was dismissed -- the judge ruled the guild couldn't
file a class-action lawsuit on behalf of women and minorities --
but it acted as a catalyst to the DGA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was, for a while, quite a white-male thing,'' Shea said of
directorial work in Hollywood. ``There seemed to have been
movement.''
</P>
<P>
   A major reason for the inequity could be an age-old Hollywood
practice, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a networking business to a great extent,'' Shea said.
``That's how a lot of deals are made.''
</P>
<P>
   To change that, the DGA is staging mixers and seminars to get
exposure for women and minorities who don't have access to people
with the power to make their professional dreams come true.
</P>
<P>
   Nanci Rossov, a veteran theater director, founded Filmanthropic,
a new film production company, in large part to help newcomers get
the needed experience to get work in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sad,'' Rossov said of the DGA's findings. ``The numbers
were small to begin with. This is perhaps disheartening.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time that the report reveals a discouraging
trend, Rossov said, it highlights the need for organizations like
Filmanthropic and work like the report compiled by the DGA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a Catch-22,'' she said. ``It takes a lot of
knowledge and experience to be a director. But how do you get
experience if you don't have it?''
</P>
<P>
   Rossov is directing a Filmanthropic production titled
``Unbowed,'' a love story between a Lakota warrior and an
African-American woman.

20 IN NYC POLICE PRECINCT ACCUSED OF SEX WITH PROSTITUTES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: The following is an added starter on The New York Times
front page)  (sw) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nineteen police officers and one sergeant working in
the Midtown South Precinct in Manhattan face disciplinary action
after being accused of having sex with prostitutes while on the
job, Police Commissioner Howard Safir said on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the top two commanders and another high ranking
officer in the precinct are being transferred to other jobs because
of what Safir called a ``breakdown of supervision.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir said that investigators believe that the liaisons with the
prostitutes occurred during the day shift in a brothel, somewhere
within the precinct boundaries. The precinct stretches from
Lexington to Eighth Avenues, and from 29th Street to 45th Street.
</P>
<P>
   The officers, he said, would disappear from the job for extended
stretches of time. He said the investigators were still seeking to
find out whether there were any monetary arrangements between the
officers and the prostitutes, and he declined to specify how often
the officers were seeing the prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner also suggested that the misconduct had been a
dubious tradition of sorts at Midtown South. He said officers
apparently were frequenting prostitutes for as long as a decade.
``Our investigation thus far indicates that a pattern of similar
misconduct by other officers may date back 10 years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We believe that the active members being scrutinized
have been using an apartment as a hangout commonly referred to in
police jargon as a coop, when in fact they should have been on
patrol,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said the disciplinary moves followed an investigation of a
year and a half by the Internal Affairs Bureau. The inquiry began
after Internal Affairs investigators apparently found out about the
alleged misconduct by questioning prostitutes after they were
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the officers under investigation were placed on modified
duty last week: Stephen Buscarino, 34, a 12-year veteran; James
Trout, 34, a 7-year veteran, Lawrence Levine, 36, a 13-year
veteran, and James Gombach, 37, a 14-year veteran. He said the
department is in the process of placing the others on modified
duty.
</P>
<P>
   Officers on modified duty are still paid, but work desk jobs.
Their guns and shields are taken by the department while Internal
Affairs officers continue to investigate the case.
</P>
<P>
   Commanding Officer Joseph McKeever is to be transferred, Safir
said, along with the precinct's executive officer, Capt. Robert
King, and Lt. Richard Kiernan. King is the No. 2 officer in the
precinct. Safir said the transfers were necessary to ``maintain
confidence in our integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to characterize the records of the officers under
scrutiny, Safir said, ``The best way I can describe the record of
most of these officers is unremarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not believe the police officers were receiving
protection money from the brothel. ``It appears that the majority
of these officers were involved in this strictly for the sexual
acts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A police spokesman, Dennis Laffin, said it was possible that the
officers would lose their jobs as a result of the sexual
misconduct, and that criminal charges were also a possibility. ``It
all depends on where the investigation takes us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosures of sexual misconduct comes, paradoxically, at a
time when Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has made a concerted effort to
remove sex-oriented business from parts of Manhattan, particular
several areas covered by the Midtown South precinct, including part
of the city's most infamous red-light district, Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Curt Ritter, a spokesman for Giuliani, said, ``The mayor
commends Commissioner Safir and the NYPD for uncovering these
allegations of corruption and misconduct and for conducting a
professional and thorough investigation.''

DEVIL RAYS BEAT ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- The Angels could not believe their good fortune as
they sailed through June, carried in large part by a starting
rotation that included two journeymen and a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   The journeymen (Steve Sparks and Omar Olivares) and the rookie
(Jarrod Washburn) were a combined 12-3 when July began. Since then,
however, the baseball gods have determined there is a limit on such
luck.
</P>
<P>
   The three have combined to go 0-7 in July, which includes
Sparks' worst outing of the season in Thursday night's 8-1 loss to
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays before 24,015 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks (3-2), who lasted only one-plus inning, gave up five runs
and three hits. His biggest problem was that he couldn't find the
plate with his knuckleball -- he walked five, matching a
season-high.
</P>
<P>
   Normally against the last-place Devil Rays, a comeback might be
possible. But the Rays had 29-year-old rookie Rolando Arrojo on the
mound.
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo, who defected from Cuba two years ago, gave up just one
run and three hits in seven innings, improving to 11-6.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the loss, the Angels remained 1 1/2 games ahead of
second-place Texas in the A.L. West. Oakland, though, moved to
within seven games of the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks lost his previous start on July 11, but he could be
forgiven. He gave up only two runs and four hits in 6 1/3 innings
to Seattle, but lost to Randy Johnson, 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   He had no such excuse on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays went into the game ranked last in the American
League in team batting average and last in the majors in runs
scored. All one really needs to know about the Rays' offense is
that that their cleanup hitter Thursday was Dave Martinez (.253,
seven homers, 35 RBIs going into the game).
</P>
<P>
   The Rays haven't scored more than eight runs in a game since
April 23.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks' knuckleball stayed out of the strikezone and the Rays
didn't have to swing much to score. He made 57 pitches, and the
Rays swung at only 14.
</P>
<P>
   One of those was Aaron Ledesma's two-run single in a five-run
first inning. Quinton McCracken also drove in a run with a single
in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   The other two runs came on bases-loaded walks to Paul Sorrento
and Miguel Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Watson, who figures to replace one of the three in the
rotation soon, relieved Sparks and pitched well. He gave up one run
-- an RBI single by Ledesma -- and five hits in four innings.
</P>
<P>
   Despite falling behind, 5-0, after the first inning, the Angels
had a chance to get back into it. Singles by Garret Anderson and
Phil Nevin, and an error by Ledesma at shortstop resulted in one
run for the Angels in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 5-1 in the third, Darin Erstad led off with a walk and
Dave Hollins walked. But Jim Edmonds killed the rally when hit a
linedrive to the first baseman Sorrento, who doubled up Hollins.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Salmon followed with a walk, but Arrojo responded by
retiring the next 12 hitters in a row. The streak was broken with
two out in the seventh when Justin Baughman reached on an error by
Cairo at second base.
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo got help from two relievers, and the Angels didn't get a
hit after Erstad's leadoff single in the third.

KILLER MARINE GETS LIFE AT LEAVENWORTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN F. SHERRY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOORPARK, Calif. -- Deanna Delino felt a moment of joy as she
watched her sister's killer leave a cramped courtroom at the El
Toro Marine Corps Air Station, bound for a life behind bars at Fort
Leavenworth, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a real big smile on my face when I watched them put the
shackles on him,'' recalled Delino, of Moorpark. ``Knowing that I
could walk out of there a free person. (That) he was going to jail,
behind bars, made me feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   Delino represented her family at the July 8 hearing for Marine
Sgt. Joseph Thomas, who avoided possible execution by accepting a
sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole or
clemency.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, a military jury convicted him of the premeditated
murder for financial gain of his pregnant wife, Melinda, who had
graduated from Conejo Valley High School in nearby Newbury Park.
Thomas was sentenced to death, but an appeals court ordered a new
penalty phase after finding that the judge in the original trial
had given confusing instructions to the jury.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for a life sentence, Thomas agreed not to request
parole or to accept any clemency offered him, said Marine Maj.
Leroy Albright. Even an order from the president cannot make him a
free man.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he ever broke that contract and accepted parole, they would
automatically retry him for the death penalty,'' Delino said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas also received a dishonorable discharge from the Marines
and agreed not to profit from his crime through books or other
media, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Melinda Thomas' family had feared a drawn-out penalty phase, at
which the gruesome facts of her death would be recounted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not want the stress and everything of going through
another trial,'' said Melinda's mother, Gwen Savage of Agoura
Hills, a Los Angeles suburb. ``In a way I'm kind of relieved that
it's over with. I think this is probably the best resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of Dec. 10, 1987, Joseph Thomas bludgeoned
Melinda Thomas to death with a tire iron as she begged for mercy,
according to court documents. After buckling her body into a seat
in the couple's Suzuki Samurai, he pushed it over a 200-foot cliff
along the Ortega Highway and set it on fire.
</P>
<P>
   El Toro prosecutors called the victim's family after Thomas'
legal representative made the offer of life in prison. Family
members decided they did not need to have him killed to bring
resolution to the case, as long as he never walked the streets a
free man.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family discussed it,'' Savage said. ``Our main concern
was, we just didn't want him out. It keeps him there forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The military did not begin offering the punishment of life in
prison without the possibility parole until January, Albright said.
Because Thomas was convicted in 1988, he was eligible only for
either the death penalty or for life in prison. A simple life
sentence would mean he would immediately be eligible for parole
because he already has served more than a decade in custody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess he felt it was better to remove the possibility of
death forever,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Moorpark is about 45 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, in
neighboring Ventura County.

   NEW YORK _ When Melissa Moy first asked people to help her
leukemic younger sister, Cindy, in January, she knew that the odds
were not good. Cindy, Melissa told people, had only a few months to
live if she could not find an appropriate bone marrow donor. And
historically, Melissa realized, an Asian-American's chance of
finding a match was slim, because of a longstanding Asian belief
that donating any part of one's body made one's soul incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   But Melissa was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   More than 7,500 people in the United States, Canada and Asia
volunteered to have their bone marrow tested for Ms. Moy, a bright
lawyer who grew up in Queens, the youngest of three daughters of
Chinese immigrants. Many of the volunteers were Asian, according to
accounts in the Chinese-language press.
</P>
<P>
   A machinist in Singapore was determined to be a match for her.
And on March 20, doctors performed a transplant at the Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, giving Cindy more time.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Ms. Moy succumbed to the cancer on July 9 at the
hospital; she was only 28. Still, her family was grateful that she
had somehow defied the odds for just a little longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``During this difficult period, Cindy's spirits were constantly
uplifted by the thousands of people who brought her great comfort
in their get-well wishes,'' said a Web page put up by the Moy
family. ``We hope that as a result of Cindy's case, awareness of
this incredibly painful disease has been heightened, and more
people will come forward to join the donor pool.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Moy's story was notable because her family made a very
public appeal on her behalf. Articles appeared in the
Chinese-language press, as well as in The Daily News, Newsday, The
Chicago Sun-Times and The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   The Moys contacted more than a dozen Asian bone marrow banks,
and organized bone marrow drives in the United States and Asia,
some through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   After the operation, Ms. Moy improved enough so that by June,
she was able to return home, her sister said in an interview on
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   It was a precious time for a close family. ``We were enjoying
the simple things in life, like going to Central Park and walking
to a favorite Italian restaurant of hers,'' Melissa Moy said. ``The
simple things that you take for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Moy had graduated from the Bronx High School of Science in
1988 and received a Bachelor of Science degree from New York
University in 1992. In 1996, she graduated from Benjamin Cardozo
Law School. Linda, the middle sister, is a doctor. Melissa, the
oldest, is a graduate of Columbia Business School and a banker.
Their father, Fee Yee Moy, is an engineer; their mother, Suk Yee
Wong, is a homemaker.
</P>
<P>
   But on July 5, Cindy fell ill again. She was rushed back to
Sloan-Kettering. She never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   After Ms. Moy's death was announced in the Chinese-language
press last week, many people mourned. So the family has scheduled a
public wake on Sunday at Ng Fook Funeral Services at 36 Mulberry
Street in Chinatown. Donations to the Moy Fund (77 East 12th
Street, Apartment 7A, New York, N.Y. 10003-5005) are to go to the
Singapore Marrow Donor Programme.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Times in March, Melissa hinted at how
the family's campaign to find donors had come a long way. ``When
you grow up in China, you believe that once something leaves your
body it's never replaced,'' she said. ``It's very difficult to
overcome that, even with your own family.''

BOTTLING A SECOND-CAREER DREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 19)  
(mk) 
 By ALICE FEIRING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   So you've socked away a fortune, developed a passion for wine
and have decided to ditch the rat race, take to the country and
make an award-winning bottle of vino. Quite a goal, especially if
the closest you've come to agriculture for the last 30 years is
mowing the lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, you never know. Consider Norman Kiken. He used to have the
tidy hands of an accountant, but now, they are nicked and scraped,
just like a farmer's, as he enters his fifth year as a winemaker in
the Napa Valley of Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   Kiken's interest in wine started innocently enough. It was 1973,
he was 30, and he read an article about wine in his dentist's
office while waiting for a root canal. With characteristic
enthusiasm, he plunged into intense study and tasting. Twenty years
later, to the shock of his New Jersey wine-tasting group, he quit
his job as chief financial officer at Leucadia National Corp., an
insurer in Manhattan, and with his wife, Evelyn, headed west.
</P>
<P>
   Kiken (pronounced KICK-en) bought 40 acres on Diamond Mountain
in the Napa region, outside Calistoga, for $1.4 million and built
himself a home and a winery, called Reverie. His modest goal was to
make ``the best red wine in the world.'' He is not there yet, but
he is gaining considerable acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, The Wine Spectator cited Reverie as one of a dozen new
wineries to watch. Then came a recommendation by Robert Parker Jr.,
the wine rater. ``Terrific raspberry nose that leaps from the
glass,'' Parker wrote in his publication, The Wine Advocate, of
Kiken's 1995 Cabernet Franc, priced at $35. Kiken now sells every
bottle he produces, and his wines are on the lists of restaurants
like Jean Georges and the Four Seasons in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Though Kiken has had more rapid success than others, he is by no
means the only winemaking refugee from the corporate world. Lewis
Perdue of Wine Investment News, an industry newsletter, calls it a
trend. ``There are certainly more of these change-of-life
winemakers now than 10 years ago,'' he said. ``It's a function of
people being successful in other careers who love wine and who like
the lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of them, he said, are dilettantes, people with vacation
homes in wine country who become weekend gentlemen-farmers.
``They'll plant a few acres of vines,'' Perdue said. ``But they
know nothing about making wine. They need the professional vineyard
management companies who can plan, run and harvest the vineyard.
They need consulting winemakers and enough facilities to lease.
This kind of support mechanism didn't exist 15 years ago. But now
it's in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Others get their hands dirty, and not just in Napa. Antony
Champ, the former chief executive of Fiber Industries, a polyester
producer in Charlotte, N.C., took a buyout offer in 1989 and wound
up making wine in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Like Kiken, Champ was in his early 50s when he jumped corporate
ship. He and his wife, Edith, traveled around wine-growing areas
before deciding where to plant vines and build their home.
</P>
<P>
   They considered the West Coast, but not too seriously. ``We
could afford it,'' he said, ``but it's not our style. We're East
Coast people.''
</P>
<P>
   They dismissed upstate New York because of the cold winters.
Long Island? Too much traffic. They found a site in Crozet, Va.,
under the shadows of the Blue Ridge Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The Champs planted their grapes in 1991 and their winery, White
Hall, lost money for five years before breaking even on a cash-flow
basis last year. Reaching that point took longer _ and was more
backbreaking _ than Champ had thought.
</P>
<P>
   He joins vineyard managers and other hands in working the
fields. ``We currently have 18 acres with about 500 vines per
acre,'' he said.``We visit each vine about four times a season. We
tie them. Position them. Prune them. Weed them. We're walking the
acreage. And consider that right now it's in the high 90s down
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the fall crush comes, we harvest the fruit into lugs,''
he said, referring to the containers used to convey the ripe
grapes. ``Last year we handled 57 tons of grapes, so we're carrying
all of that in 30-pound parcels at a time. During the crush,
especially if we have to pick the grapes quickly before bad weather
comes, we could be having 20-hour days.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Champs have no complaints. The winemaking life, they
say, is refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   ``In parts of the business world, people will cut your throat
for a tenth of a cent, but not here,'' he said. ``If you're in a
jam, people help you out in this industry. It's more about
community than making money.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, this is a labor of love, not a fabulous
investment. First-time winemakers hear ad nauseam the old joke:
``How to make a small fortune in the wine business? Start with a
large one.''
</P>
<P>
   It helps to have work experience that can translate. Champ had a
background in chemistry and experience in marketing. And when
Leucadia invested in a financially troubled California winery,
Kiken learned about the potential financial pitfalls of the
business.
</P>
<P>
   Kiken had no marketing or sales experience, so he has learned on
the fly about finding distributors and working the market, choosing
to sell only in California and states he likes to visit: New York,
New Jersey and Florida. On such trips, he makes contacts and sales
calls and attends trade shows. He also publishes a chatty
semiannual newsletter, updating winery visitors about the harvest,
new varietals and the like.
</P>
<P>
   But can such vintners make money? That is generally not the
goal, Perdue said. ``When people make lifestyle choices like this,
they're looking for a break-even situation, or something that
doesn't lose too much money,'' he said. ``Having a gigantic return
on assets doesn't figure in as one of the prime considerations.''  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Vic Motto of Motto, Kryla &AMP; Fisher, an accounting firm in St.
Helena, Calif., specializing in the wine industry, has held
people's hands through the winemaking process for 16 years. ``If
you don't have a million dollars of annual discretionary assets,
you probably shouldn't even think of entering the market,'' Motto
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The typical winemaker with a winery invests $3 to $5 for every
dollar of sale, less for a custom crush,'' he added. ``Can you make
money? Maybe in 15 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, a devoted winemaker can see a decent return, especially
by entering the market with wine that sells for at least $20 a
bottle. ``Wine has never been as profitable as it has been in the
past three years,'' said Jon Fredrickson of Gomberg, Fredrickson &AMP;
Associates, a San Francisco company that tracks the industry.
``There have been at least 10 times more successful start-up
wineries than failures.''
</P>
<P>
   The typical winery investor who visits Mark Brody, a vice
president and manager at the commercial banking office of Sanwa
Bank in San Francisco, is male and 50 or older _ and someone who
could easily start his business without a loan but does not want to
tie up that much cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go for so many years without making a dime in this
business,'' Brody said, ``that people who come to us for wine money
must have deep pockets themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Napa Valley is the most expensive viticultural area in the
country. Land already planted with disease-resistant, grape-bearing
vines sells for more than $60,000 an acre. Plantable land costs
considerably less _ $20,000 an acre. But going the bargain route
involves as many as five years for the vines to bear usable fruit,
and a minimum of two more years to get the bottles on the shelves.
That is a seven-year wait to see any return on investment _ six
years if the product is white wine, which requires less aging.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the large overhead involved, prudent newcomers ease
their way into the business. The cheapest way to start _ the
``custom crush'' method _ is to rent equipment and to buy other
people's grapes.
</P>
<P>
   This path is commonplace; Kiken said it takes $250,000 to
produce a modest 2,500 cases. Three to four years later, when those
cases finally reach the shelves, profitability is unlikely, but
cash-flow break-even can be reached, he said, if the bottles each
sell at $22 to $23.
</P>
<P>
   A key point in this kind of operation is to sign up a
high-profile winemaker as a consultant, even though these services
might start at $18,000 and run as high as six figures for a few
months of work. Such consultants can provide contacts for buying
the crucial, first-rate grapes, and can attract attention for a new
winery _ assuring that premium prices can be charged, even by an
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Produced this way, a red wine, from crush to bottle, could be
ready for that Robert Parker rating in little more than 18 months.
Kiken started out on a variation of this plan, but he always used
his own grapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with a custom job,'' Kiken said,
``except that the more control you have over your wine, the more
you can control your own destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Brody, the banker, warns every prospective winery owner seeking
a loan about the risks and the barriers. Even so, he admits to some
envy. With complete conviction, he asked, ``Doesn't everyone who
loves wine has a dream to make it?''

REGINA JACOBS HAS A LIST OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS ABOUT A MILE LONG 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - Since the early 1980s, American track and field has
showcased such female stars as Florence Griffith Joyner, Jackie
Joyner-Kersee, Mary Slaney, Gail Devers, Joan Benoit Samuelson and
now Marion Jones. All this time, Regina Jacobs has been there,
quietly winning titles and breaking records.
</P>
<P>
   From 1987 to 1997, the Californian won seven U.S. championships
at 1,500 meters outdoors. Four weeks ago, in the oppressive heat of
New Orleans, she won the national title at 5,000 meters with a
blazing last 400-meter lap in 59.8 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   In last year's world outdoor championship, she won the silver
medal at 1,500 meters, the only American woman or man to capture a
medal at that distance or longer. As a full-time runner, she earns
a six-figure income.
</P>
<P>
   With all those credentials, Jacobs, at age 34, remains a great
unknown. On July 4 in Brunswick, Maine, she set an American record
of 14 minutes 56.06 seconds for 5,000 meters, but few people have
heard about it.
</P>
<P>
   Her next race should gain more attention. On Monday night in the
remodeled Mitchel Athletic Complex in Uniondale, N.Y., she will run
the Goodwill Games women's mile against such stars as Svetlana
Masterkova, the Russian who won two gold medals in the 1996 Atlanta
Olympics, Suzy Hamilton of the United States and Sonia O'Sullivan
of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   As you might expect from one who holds a bachelor's degree in
English and communications from Stanford and a master's in business
administration from the University of California, Jacobs accepts
that others are more famous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thought about it,'' Jacobs said on Thursday. ``But then
I'll walk through an airport and the person behind the desk will
say: `Oh, I know you. You going to run somewhere?' And coming home
from a trip, I was walking through the Chicago airport when I
overheard a young man saying to his friend, `I told you it was
her.'''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Craig is Jacobs' husband and coach. ``I think she's like
Martina Navratilova,'' he said. ``It took years before people
realized how good Martina was. Regina has been out there a long
time as a journeywoman. Only in the last three years did she break
out. In our society, everything has to be now.''
</P>
<P>
   The breakout will be more dramatic with another fast 1,500
meters. Slaney and O'Sullivan have come close, but no women has
broken all three barriers: 2 minutes for 800 meters, 4 minutes for
1,500 meters and 15 minutes for 5,000 meters. Jacobs' respective
bests are 1:59.36, 4:00.46 and 14:52.49.
</P>
<P>
   Until December 1996, Jacobs seldom ran anything longer than a
mile. Then O'Sullivan ran away from her in the Waikiki Mile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked Tom why,'' Jacobs said, ``and he said it because she
trained like a 5,000-meter runner with 1,500-meter speed. He said
if you want to be strong, you have to do 5,000-meter training along
with 1,500-meter training. I had not done the mileage, and who
wants to do long workouts for the 5,000 when you can do short ones
for the 1,500? But I decided I would do hard interval training.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig remembered. ``She said the pain was so bad that it was
like going to the dentist,'' he said, ``but she did the work. The
day after that Waikiki race, she ran six miles. The next day, she
ran eight 800's with a one-minute recovery. They weren't fast, but
it was a start.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs' lithe, 5-foot-6-inch, 112-pound body blends unusual
speed with unusual strength, and she enjoys racing now at any
distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the competition,'' she said. ``I love being in the best
possible shape and being next to someone doing the same thing.
That's exhilarating. If I feel that, it doesn't matter who wins or
loses.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs has heroines of her own in the 39-year-old Slaney and
Merlene Ottey, the 38-year-old Jamaican sprinter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting to see people like Mary Slaney and Merlene Ottey
still competing,'' Jacobs said. ``Seeing older people do that
confirms for me that I can do that. I don't worry about getting
older. Every year I get better and better and my mind gets stronger
and stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone asked me if I wished I was 25 again. I said no, that
I'd hate it. A certain confidence comes with getting older. You
know your limits. You know how far you can push yourself. I have a
focus, an inner strength, a confidence I didn't have when I was
younger.''  &QL;

DODGERS BEAT CARDINALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Tom Lasorda waded across the crowded Dodgers
clubhouse for only one reason _ to plant a kiss on the cheeks of
Ismael Valdes.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda, the Dodgers new general manager, knows there is only
one way to save this season. It's using his old shtick to pump up
his indifferent team.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda then pulled back from Valdes, who had just defeated the
St. Louis Cardinals 8-2 Thursday night at Busch Stadium and yelled
in Spanish ``if you pitch like this, you will make the big money.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a thought seemed unlikely under the old regime of manager
Bill Russell and pitching coach Goose Gregson.
</P>
<P>
   Russell and Valdes nearly came to blows last season in the
dugout during a game.Valdes and Gregson never were in sync.
</P>
<P>
   But since those two were let go last month, Valdes has shown
signs of the pitcher who won 28 games in his first two full
major-league seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you what it has meant to me to have Tommy
around,'' Valdes said. ``The communication is so much better. We
laugh a lot, we joke around. He gives me big hugs. He makes me feel
like I am part of something.''
</P>
<P>
   On a 90-degree night, Valdes (7-9) limited the Cardinals to six
hits and two runs. He struck out eight and did not walk a batter.
Perhaps just as important, Valdes shut down Cardinals' slugger Mark
McGwire, who is bidding to break Roger Maris' single-season record
of 61 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes also moved the Dodgers a half game closer in the National
League wild-card race. They are five games behind idle San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows how important he is to this team,'' Lasorda said.
``I'm not trying to change anything mechanical. All I want to do is
put my arm around him and show him that we care.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't hurt Thursday that Valdes was supported by eight runs,
including seven in the first four innings.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Mondesi hit his 21st homer and Gary Sheffield added his
16th, both off Cardinals' left-hander Kent Mercker (5-7).
</P>
<P>
   For Mondesi, it was his fifth homer and 14th and 15th RBI since
moving to the third spot in the order 15 games ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield also had two singles and has reached base in 28
consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   Wilton Guerrero, who went 7 for 18 in place of injured Eric
Young during the Dodgers' recent homestand, had three hits and
scored two runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When that happens it makes everything easier,'' said Valdes,
who left after seven with a cramp in his right leg. ``I have felt
my confidence building in the last few weeks but when you get a
game like that, it really soars.''
</P>
<P>
   Confidence is the biggest change new pitching coach Charlie
Hough sees in Valdes.
</P>
<P>
   Including his two-hit, 1-0 victory over Oakland on June 10, and
a near-perfect game versus Pittsburgh on June 26, Valdes has won
just three times. But his earned run average has dropped from 5.48
to 4.12.
</P>
<P>
   All that is good news for Valdes, who is eligible for salary
arbitration after the season. He is earning $2.8 million in 1998
and could double that with a big year.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Valdes also won on the road, where he came in 2-6 with
a 5.30 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to remember this guy is just 24 years old,'' Hough
said. ``There is still so much to learn. He has to learn to pitch
on the nights when he doesn't have his best stuff. That can be
tough. Right now, he is back on his game. It is great to see.''

Christenson Ignites A's Victory  c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Even Rickey Henderson wasn't on to A's rookie
center fielder Ryan Christenson coming into the year, so you can't
really blame Royals manager Tony Muser for just not getting it.
</P>
<P>
   Christenson was a walk-on back at Pepperdine University, before
he played his way into a scholarship and led his conference in
hitting.
</P>
<P>
   He has always been the anti-Grieve, the guy who comes along with
no fanfare but plays like a guy you should have been trumpeting the
whole time. He's Mike Bordick, only in center field.
</P>
<P>
   Muser played the percentages Thursday, intentionally walking
Mike Blowers in the sixth to face Christenson with the bases loaded
and the game tied 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   That makes sense on paper, going for the double play. But in
real life, Christenson has yet to hit into a double play this
season in 163 at-bats, and he wasn't about to start, not after he
had been challenged. He singled to left to bring home two runs and
kick-start the A's toward a 5-3 win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't insulted,'' Christenson said. ``It's the play to do.
But you do kind of take it personally. You want to get a little
respect out of it. You want to plant a seed in his mind that next
time he wouldn't want to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Muser did not exactly give his choice the hard sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in a real fix, tie ballgame, one out, grasping for
straws,'' he said. ``Maybe we'd get a double play. We took a chance
on getting a double play some way.''
</P>
<P>
   Chalk it up as just one more spike in the up-and-down realities
of A's manager Art Howe's ongoing memoir, ``Life With the Kids.''
This time, it was a beautiful thing watching as another talented
A's rookie found out a little more about himself as a ballplayer.
</P>
<P>
   Christenson has been the A's top center fielder since Jason
McDonald went down in May, and he has become a fixture.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're not really expected to be on the team, you want to
show you belong,'' Henderson said. ``He got a break and he's done a
lot with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Christenson is a guy you can watch every minute he's out there.
He doesn't just run hard when he pops up a ball into the shallow
outfield, he busts it down the line and makes his crisp turn just
as if he has foreknowledge the ball is going to drop. If it doesn't
fall, he lopes back to the dugout, just happy to be giving it his
all.
</P>
<P>
   He has such great instincts in center field, the lines he traces
are clean and eloquent. You almost want to see them collected and
superimposed on a TV screen, like the arcs traced by the long balls
during the All-Star Game homer contest.
</P>
<P>
   The result, at the very least, would be a whole lot better than
anything by LeRoy Neiman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably one of the best center fielders in the league,''
teammate Matt Stairs said.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to starter Blake Stein's fine effort, the A's (45-49)
bounced back from an anemic little loss to the Royals the night
before. They are back to four games under .500, and they get three
games against Minnesota (42-51 going into Thursday) this weekend to
try to improve that mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a huge win,'' Stairs said. ``We took Kansas City maybe
a little lightly. Today we kind of woke up.''
</P>
<P>
   Stein gave up two runs in the third, and that was all. He held
the Royals to four hits in his 7 1/3 innings, and seems to be
gaining something as the season progresses. He was more fluid, more
confident, than earlier in the year, and that was one more plus for
a rotation on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   Since the All-Star break, A's starters are 4-1 and have given up
just eight earned runs in 571/3 innings for a 1.25 ERA.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Woods Back in The Hunt &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; SOUTHPORT, England _ I was next in line at the portable toilet
when Tiger Woods suddenly appeared, with no time to spare on his
way to the 10th tee.
</P>
<P>
   What a great opportunity to become an obnoxious American, like
the guys who heckled Colin Montgomerie at the Olympic Club. ``No
dice, pal,'' I would say to Tiger. ``Get in line like the rest of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Lurching back to reality, I moved back about five paces. At
Royal Birkdale Thursday, the whole British Open stepped aside for
him.
</P>
<P>
   It was a terrific slice of the Tiger Woods we like to see: Out
in front, crushing his drives, lofting gentle chip shots and
sinking the big putts. I spent 18 holes watching him get back into
the major-tournament mainstream. It was just one round, but like
all the great ones _ Hogan, Snead, Palmer, Nicklaus _ Tiger doesn't
need much to stir up attention. By the final five holes of his
opening-round 65, his gallery looked like the Champs-Elysees on
World Cup Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In a shocking development, the British summer arrived along with
Tiger. I walked to the first hole in a long-sleeved shirt,
turtleneck and heavy windbreaker, just out of habit after three icy
days. By about the 5th hole, I wanted to grab a pair of trunks and
race out to the Irish Sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just perfect,'' said Woods. ``I think you might get
some people with heat stroke out here.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a rich and satisfying summer they have over here, by the
way. It might last all the way to this morning. By this afternoon,
they're expecting a grim return to rainstorms and high winds,
lasting right through tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, that sounds a bit more like it,'' said crafty Nick
Price, who was in Woods' threesome Thursday and shot a crisp 66.
``This stuff today is too good to be true.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods' gallery saw many sides of him Thursday. They saw him
jogging purposefully on a bathroom break (his first of two, after
the 4th hole), and he looked good doing it. You'd imagine him
running the 400 meters and smoking the field.
</P>
<P>
   They also saw Tiger on his hands and knees, looking for someone
else's ball. What a way to start the British: Per-Ulrik Johansson
hit his very first tee shot into high shrubbery, surely scattering
a few newts and bar-tailed godwits into hiding. Even with course
marshals at the ready, this baby was gone.
</P>
<P>
   The three players searched for nearly two minutes before they
found it, hopelessly buried. Johansson got a penalty drop, took a
triple-bogey and did damn well to finish at 74 with his two
partners playing so spectacularly.
</P>
<P>
   This was a fabulous day to be out on the course. It's an awfully
far cry from the Olympic Club or so many great American layouts
with their steep hills and massive trees. Here you look across the
flatlands forever, as far as the eye can see. The crowds appear to
be larger because they're so prominent: a sight of humanity _ or
anything _ on the stark landscape. Stately, red-brick houses loom
far in the distance. If there ever was an Earl of Shank, he
probably lived in one of them.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd is exceptionally polite, acting only in unison with
tremendously polite applause. The occasional out-of-context shout
is heard, but most of these people sound like BBC television
commentators, whispering under their breath as a shot lands on the
green.
</P>
<P>
   ``Magnificent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well-played.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Struck with purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Journalists have read all week about Royal Birkdale's celebrated
wildlife. It remained something of a mystery Thursday. I didn't see
a single toad, mute swan or moorhen (although I heard they'd all
gone off to join Lee Westwood's gallery).
</P>
<P>
   The human faces were priceless, though. I saw a lot of
dignified, white-haired gentlemen who reminded me of my San
Francisco-raised father-in-law, the good Irishman Joe Stanton. And
there's another distinct brand of British Isles spectator, a
craggy, red-nosed sort who loves his Famous Grouse Whiskey and
looks like he's been working an anvil for the past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Tanned and rugged, but mostly craggy, these guys are course
fixtures _ caddies, players, or just lovers of the game. They speak
English, but in a manner impossible to understand. It falls
somewhere in the middle of Scottish, cockney and craggy.
</P>
<P>
   One of these men spotted my press badge and addressed me as I
walked along the 15th hole Thursday. Dearly wanting to respond, I
became a fake but instant Scot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aye, the gorse,'' I said. ``Aww, it's one wee bonny of a
firth.''
</P>
<P>
   The man grimaced at me, revealing two of his three teeth.
</P>
<P>
   The most pleasant fellow on the grounds? Tiger Woods, in a real
upset. He was delighted with his patience and maturity out there,
managing the course like Old Tom Morris himself. As the day
progressed, steady hands like Fred Couples, Ernie Els, Justin
Leonard and Bernhard Langer found themselves in hopeless,
deep-in-the-rough predicaments. Tiger seemed to be living a charmed
life all day.
</P>
<P>
   Normally somewhat aloof, in his own little world, Woods had some
nice interactions with the crowd _ reporters, even. Passing a group
of us as he walked down a dirt road from the 14th tee, he smiled
and said, ``Moseying along the old dusty trail ... when you get on
the grass, it's amazing how quiet it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   That can mean only one thing. Life is a little too good at the
British Open. With any luck today, there will be no sleet.

APPEALS COURT REJECTS EFFORT TO KEEP SECRET SERVICE OFFICIALS FROM
TESTIFYING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 12th and 13th grafs for new material on Justice Department's
latest petition to Supreme Court)  (With CLINTON-STARR-TEXT) 
(sw) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Acting with unusual speed, nine judges on the
federal appeals court here unanimously rejected a last-minute
request by the Clinton administration to block the testimony of
Secret Service officials, including the head of President Clinton's
protective detail, in the Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department immediately responded with an emergency
petition forwarded to Chief Justice William Rehnquist of the
Supreme Court. The sealed petition asks Rehnquist, who is in Europe
while the court is in recess, to delay any testimony by Secret
Service officials until the full court can consider the
administration's appeal, lawyers involved in the case said.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief order on Thursday, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia declined the administration's request
to have the full bench reconsider the argument for a novel
privilege that would shield Secret Service officials from having to
testify. A three-judge panel of the appeals court had sided with
the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, on the issue just last
week. The administration's move was seen as a desperate gambit,
particularly because the full court does not often grant such
reviews.
</P>
<P>
   And a terse order issued earlier on Thursday by three of the
nine appeals judges once again signaled that the administration
faced long odds. ``We also believe, for the reasons stated in our
opinion of July 7, 1998, that the Justice Department's likelihood
of success before the Supreme Court is insufficient to warrant
further delay in the grand jury's investigation,'' said the three
judges, who first heard the appeal last month.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, had sought the testimony of a few uniformed Secret
Service officers for several months. After court decisions were
issued in his favor, including the appellate ruling last week by
the three-judge panel involved in Thursday's action, Starr cast a
wider net this week. He subpoenaed the agents closest to President
Clinton, setting off a firestorm of criticism by administration
officials and laying the groundwork for a confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was punctuated by a flurry of legal briefs and
rapid-fire court rulings that started early on as seven Secret
Service officials under subpoena prepared to enter the grand jury
room on Thursday morning. Their testimony was temporarily put off
at the last minute so that appeals could be pursued.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, administration officials began bracing
for the possibility that some of the agents may have to appear as
early as next week when the grand jury resumes.
</P>
<P>
   One of the agents subpoenaed this week was Larry Cockell, the
head of Clinton's detail who spends more time with the president
than any other Government employee. Anticipating that Cockell, an
18-year-veteran of the Secret Service, may soon have to spend
considerable time being questioned, the agency on Thursday
temporarily reassigned him to a less demanding job. Officials said
it would be impossible for him to be at the president's side in
Washington and on the road if he must also spend time as a grand
jury witness.
</P>
<P>
   While the decision on Thursday moves the Secret Service
officials one step closer to testifying before the grand jury, it
also foreshadows future court disputes between the independent
counsel and the president.
</P>
<P>
   The president's private lawyers have expressed concern that
investigators may ask Secret Service agents what they may have
overheard of conversations between Clinton and his lawyers. Such
questions would be all but certain to prompt a new round of legal
wrangling over the parameters of the lawyer-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   The blanket rejection of the administration's appeal came
remarkably quick, just two days after Attorney General Janet Reno
pleaded for the judges to intervene and avert what she said ``is
likely to result in a national tragedy.'' The Secret Service has
been maintained that if agents are forced to testify, they will no
longer be able to protect the president adequately because he could
be inclined to push them away.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday evening, the Justice Department filed another
petition asking the Supreme Court to consider the case on the
merits. ``History leaves no doubt that the nation will face future
Presidential assassination attempts,'' the brief stated. ``The
Secret Service stands between the Nation and the calamity of
assassination. The Court of Appeals' refusal to recognize the
protective function privilege will undermine the Secret Service's
ability to step into the breach and protect the Nation from
profound and predictable peril.''
</P>
<P>
   Its first emergency petition was lodged early on Wednesday night
with the clerk of the court. And it moved on Thursday have the
papers put in Rehnquist's hands. The appellate court gave the
Secret Service until Friday at noon to seek a stay from Rehnquist.
But the order by the three appeals court judges reduced the chances
that the chief justice would intervene.
</P>
<P>
   They found that the Justice Department had failed to show a stay
was necessary to avert an ``irreparable harm.'' Supreme Court
practice requires Rehnquist to make such a finding before issuing
any stays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Department of Justice has not made a sufficient showing
that irreparable harm will result unless a stay and an order are
issued, and it has not made a sufficient showing that it will
ultimately prevail in establishing the privilege it alleges,''
wrote the three judges, Douglas Ginsburg, A. Raymond Randolph, and
Stephen Williams. ``The privilege is said to be necessary because,
without it, the President will distance himself from Secret Service
agents charged with the duty of protecting him.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The harm asserted is future harm, depending on a prediction
about what the President will do in the absence of the privilege.
This court has ruled that the privilege does not exist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If harm of the sort the Department envisions is now occurring,
it therefore must be because the President does not believe the
Supreme Court will sustain the privilege,'' the order said.
``Neither a stay nor an order under the All Writs Act can alter or
prevent that alleged harm. Testimony today by Secret Service agents
regarding past events cannot change our ruling. And such testimony
cannot affect how the Supreme Court will rule.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration's assertion of a special privilege for the
agents has been rejected by every judge who has considered it. Even
several of the president's advisers predicted that in light of
Thursday's decisions, it would be unlikely that Rehnquist would
issue a stay. The Supreme Court does not begin hearing cases until
it returns in October.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   White House officials, who have said that Clinton has not been
involved in the Secret Service appeal, declined to comment on
Thursday's ruling. But they took issue with a concurring opinion to
the full court's ruling rejecting the administration's request for
review.
</P>
<P>
   In the concurring opinion, Judge Laurence Silberman wrote that
the attorney general was ``acting as the President's counsel under
the false guise of representing the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am mindful of the terrible political pressures and strains
of conscience that bear upon senior political appointees of the
Justice Department when an Independent Counsel (or special
prosecutor) is investigating the President of the United States,''
Silberman wrote. ``Those strains are surely exacerbated when the
President's agents literally and figuratively `declare war' on the
Independent Counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge's comments were disputed by Charles Ruff, the counsel
to the President.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we have stated before, the attorney general and the
secretary of the Treasury have made their decisions on how to
proceed in this matter with complete independence, guided by the
advice of career law enforcement professionals,'' Ruff said. ``They
have had only one interest _ to ensure that the Secret Service is
able to perform its vitally important duties. Any suggestion to the
contrary is without foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Secret Service officials received a reprieve from
having to appear the grand jury, the jurors continued their work on
Thursday by hearing from Linda Tripp for the sixth time. It was
Mrs. Tripp who began the Lewinsky inquiry when she called the
independent counsel's office last January and said she had secretly
recorded conversations with, Ms. Lewinsky, her former Pentagon
colleague, that suggested an unlawful coverup.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp is scheduled to return to the grand jury when it
resumes its deliberations next Tuesday.

A GRAND WIN FOR RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There's no sense wondering why they can't do it every
night, but the Red Sox went on an offensive rampage Thursday night
_ and they did it against a Cleveland team that is destined for the
American League playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Only one night after scratching out a 1-0 victory, the Red Sox
exploded for 17 hits in a 15-5 rout of the Indians at Fenway Park
that gave them a two-game series sweep and restored their
credibility that vanished following the All-Star break. Troy
O'Leary and Nomar Garciaparra each drove in five runs to lead the
way. O'Leary hit a grand slam in the fourth to wipe out a 4-1
deficit. Garciaparra hit a three-run dinger in the fifth to make it
an 8-4 game.
</P>
<P>
   And just to add salt to the wound, the Sox scored seven more
runs in the eighth when they sent 12 men to the plate. This might
happen more often if the Red Sox could stay close to home. Alas,
the next six games are on the road, three each in Detroit and
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six home games, the Red Sox scored 15 runs in four
of them. The question remains, which Red Sox team will show up
Friday night in the Motor City?
</P>
<P>
   ``O'Leary's grand slam put us back in there,'' said manager Jimy
Williams. ``Then came Nomar's home run. It's not just at home. I
think we play pretty good everywhere. That's the nature of the
game. Good pitching shuts down good hitting. Sometimes it's the
other way and hitting gets contagious. It just happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitting was contagious Thursday night, and it wasn't just the
Red Sox. Home runs accounted for four of the five Cleveland runs,
all off winner Tim Wakefield who went 7 1/3 innings to pick up his
11th victory. Travis Fryman and David Bell homered in the second
inning to wipe out a 1-0 Boston lead. Dave Justice hit a solo shot
off Wakefield in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   But after blowing a 1-0 lead, the Red Sox went to work for their
knuckleball specialist who has a reputation for keeping games
close. By the time Wakefield left, Boston was ahead, 8-5. Relievers
Ron Mahay and Derek Lowe mopped up. Good pitching also appears to
be contagious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It begins with your starters,'' said Williams. ``I talk about
Wakefield giving quality innings. He does. But just innings don't
mean a thing to me. But to pitch 200 inning, you have to pitch good
innings. You feel like you've got a chance to win a game everytime
Wake's out there. He kept us in that game.''
</P>
<P>
   Indians starter Dwight Gooden was coasting along in the fifth
when the Red Sox brought out the heavy artillery. Darren Bragg led
off with a double to left. Garciaparra and Vaughn walked, loading
the bases. O'Leary, not known as a home-run hitter, just wanted to
get the ball in the air and bring home a run. He got the ball into
the air and into the left-field screen for a 5-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been awhile since I hit a home run,'' said O'Leary. ``I'm
not a home-run hitter. I didn't want to hit into a double play. I
got the ball in the air and it went out. I'm not surprised that
this team battled back. We have a lot of guys with a lot of heart
on this team. All these guys can hit, too. Hopefully, with things
going the way they are going right now, we will be able to maintain
it.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary has come a long way, added Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does a lot of things to help our ball club,'' said the
manager. ``He's improved immensely defensively. Now he hits well
and drives in runs.''
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, Gooden was replaced by Chad Ogea. With one out,
the one-time starter gave up a single to Darren Lewis and a walk to
Bragg. Garciaparra then hit a shot 422 feet into the bleachers. The
rest of the night was a party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basicially, we've played good baseball,'' said Lewis. ``We
lost four one-run games on the road but we've been in every game.
When you go down, you have to turn the page as quick as possible.
We did it last night and we were able to come back tonight and do
the same thing. It was nice for us to be home and in comfortable
surroundings.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his start, Wakefield was comfortable, too. He has
pitched at least six innings in 17 of 20 starts. He has won five of
the last six and despite a 4.31 earned run average remains among
the league's best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad to see we scored some runs tonight,'' said Wakefield,
eager to share the credit for his fine start. ``I think it will
open the door for guys' confidence to keep going. We played some
tight ballgames with Baltimore and Tampa Bay. We've been in every
ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Numbers aren't important until the year is over with. I
couldn't tell you my numbers. Only thing I can look at is innings
pitched and I see I'm there 6-7 innings most starts. I take a lot
of pride in that.''

JOHNSON HURLS ONE-HITTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ He mumbles to himself perhaps more now than ever
before. But what Randy Johnson is saying remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever occupies his mind, however, Johnson is throwing with a
renewed sense of purpose. He is throwing as hard as he ever has.
And Thursday night, he flirted with his second career no-hitter
during the Mariners' 3-0 victory over the Minnesota Twins at the
Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who has been virtually lost in a season of discontent,
is back.
</P>
<P>
   The big left-hander punished an opponent from the mound for the
second time in as many starts. Last Saturday, he pitched a five-hit
shutout against Anaheim, striking out 15. This time, he held
together a no-hitter for 71/3 innings and finished with a
one-hitter, 11 strikeouts and his second consecutive shutout.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many of our guys got rung up? Boom! Boom! Boom!,''
Minnesota manager Tom Kelly said. ``Randy pitched great. He had
no-hit stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy's on top of his game right now,'' concurred Mariners
manager Lou Piniella. ``His fastball really had some hop on it. He
located it well. There wasn't anything that wasn't working.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he had that no-hitter in the seventh, I thought he would
get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had one out in eighth when former Mariner Brent Gates,
hitting from the No. 8 spot in the order, lined a base hit over the
second base bag. Gates hit an outside fastball off the end of his
bat and just over Johnson's outstretched glove.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to break it up,'' said Gates. ``He's the best
pitcher in the American League. He's very intimidating, very
dominant. I got to see a lot of that last year and it was a lot of
fun to watch. But it was not as much fun being on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was getting ahead of a lot of the hitters, throwing a good
slider. And he always has that dominating fastball. When he's
getting ahead and throwing a lot of strikes, he's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   The Twins' lone hit came after Johnson struck out 10, walked
three and committed a balk. Johnson, though, recorded his 94th
career game with 10 or more strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   It was his third career one-hitter. Johnson (9-8) also watched
his sixth no-hit bid falter.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw (the hit) I thought he was going to catch it. But I
think Randy thought it was hit harder than it was. I was bummed out
more than he was,'' said John Marzano, who has become Johnson's
regular batterymate.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, Johnson did not seem tormented about not securing
the no-hitter. He did not speak to the media, and hasn't for the
past 1{ months. Johnson, in many ways, has become a loner in the
Mariner clubhouse because he wants to be traded.
</P>
<P>
   However, Johnson _ rattled earlier this season by his situation
_ is apparently focused. He took care of the Twins mostly on his
own _ striking out six straight hitters during one stretch.
</P>
<P>
   He ended the fourth with two strikeouts. Then, Johnson mowed
down three batters in the fifth and the first Twins batter he faced
in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he's been pitching lately is unbelievable,'' Marzano
said. ``I think he can finish with 20 wins. . . . When he pitches
good, our team gets on a roll.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are now 10 games behind Anaheim in their quest to
crawl into the American League West race and are 6-2 since the
All-Star break. They've benefited from solid pitching and improved
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. supplied the only stirring catch Johnson needed
to preserve his no-hit bid in the early innings.
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning, Minnesota's Ron Coomer launched a Johnson
fastball deep into centerfield. Griffey gave chase to the ball,
which tailed away, going to his right.
</P>
<P>
   When Griffey caught up to the ball, he ran with his back to home
plate, his head skyward and glove extended for the catch. It was
the second time this week Griffey's made the Willie Mays-like play.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Griffey robbed Texas' Will Clark with an identical
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson pumped his fist after Griffey's catch. He shook his head
and then waved to Griffey in an act of appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was quite boring for me,'' Griffey joked before adding:
``When he's on you just try to do the little things.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners took a 2-0 lead in the fourth inning after Shane
Monahan's clutch hit. The M's young left fielder laid his bat on a
low fastball, and lined a triple into the right centerfield gap.
</P>
<P>
   David Segui and Edgar Martinez scored after earlier hitting
back-to-back singles. The two-out at-bat produced Monahan's ninth
hit and fourth RBI since he entered the lineup nearly a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Monahan accounted for all of the Mariners runs. His two-out
single to center drove in David Segui in the sixth, which ended
with the Mariners ahead for a 3-0 Mariner advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the only two mistakes Minnesota loser Brad Radke
(9-8) made all night. His just happened to pitch on the same night
as Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what he can do,'' Radke said of Johnson. ``He'll shut
you out in a heartbeat.''
</P>

ON BRITISH LINKS, WOODS REALIZES PATIENCE A VIRTUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHPORT, England _ Even English to English, some things don't
translate.
</P>
<P>
   Like Tiger Woods explaining how Thursday's conditions at Royal
Birkdale Golf Club reminded him of West Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Wait until the locals figure out that West Texas is hell's
exhaust pipe. British-American relations will be set back a hundred
years.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, the kid might not have been far off. Almost
incomprehensibly, Britain's western shoreline turned up hard and
dry, with a breeze but not a hurricane. No sagebrush was visible,
but the crunching brown underfoot of pennywort, creeping willow and
gorse made it feel like August in El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the matter of the American idiom. Woods was
trying to explain to his international journalistic inquisitors how
he managed to tear asunder the British Open with his opening-round
65.
</P>
<P>
   Although he spent little time in the rough, he said it was so
gnarly that extricating the ball robbed it of the spin needed to
control the shot. The knuckleball was to be avoided at all costs on
these slick fairways and greens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Niekro would be proud of some of the shots you can hit to get
out of this rough,'' he said. Of course, no one but the smattering
of Yank scribes understood the reference to Phil and Joe, the
Niekro brothers of knuckleball pitching fame. Unfortunately, the
oblivious included the British transcriber, who produced the first
word in the transcripts as ``Negro.''
</P>
<P>
   Notified of the ironic gaffe, the horrified Royal &AMP; Ancient
staff, guardians of tournament propriety and protocol, snarfed up
as many errant copies as they could and quickly punched out a
corrected version.
</P>
<P>
   No one seemed to mind. It was a sports event hard to disturb. Be
it Niekro and Negro, Yank or Brit, all gloried in a day with which
Woods nearly ran away.
</P>
<P>
   Trailed by an unwieldy knot of cameramen and reporters, watched
by hordes clambering and stumbling over the grass-covered dunes,
Woods was the tournament's calm heart. Using his driver on just
four holes and often out-distanced by playing partners Nick Price
and Per-Ulrik Johansson, the American wunderkind exchanged his
standard heavy artillery for a craftier, almost flawless short
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it looked like he throttled back a little bit today,
which is good to see,'' said Price, who was a stroke back at 66.
``He went hard at one shot, which was a 2-iron into 15. That's the
only one I saw him go hard at. A year ago, he used to do that a
little more frequently.
</P>
<P>
   ``He managed his game.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods acknowledged that the fireworks that usually accompany his
game have been occasionally counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just learning how to play golf,'' he said. ``I think it's
an evolutionary process every player goes through. If you ask any
player back in his early 20s and teens, they hit the ball pretty
hard. As they get older they learn to control their game. I'm no
exception to that _ still learning to flight the ball, learning a
lot of different shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, I'm very pleased with my progress.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Woods hasn't already impressed an Open gallery. He
shot a 64 at last year's event at Troon. But it went with
lackluster rounds of 72, 74 and 74 that made for a 24th-place
finish at 284.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the tournament, the suspicion was that Woods was still
some years away from the patience and cunning required to master
the vagaries of British links courses. But he up and slapped
Birkdale so hard Thursday that his history might have telescoped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one of those things where I think I learned to play
smart golf, and understand that some of the lies you get here can
go a lot farther than they look,'' he said. ``I can hit an 8-iron
close to 190 in the air just because of some of the lies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year (overclubbing the ball) happened to me because I
didn't really understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods came across the pond a week early with neighbor and fellow
Masters winner Mark O'Meara to fish and play golf in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really enjoyed it because you get acclimatized to this
weather,'' he said. ``Unfortunately the golf got in the way of
fishing. That was the mindset we had last week _ stay relaxed,
prepare and understand you don't want to peak last week.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods' 10 a.m. tee time, and his quick posting of red numbers on
the scoreboard, sent younger golf fans among the 37,000 in
attendance skittering across the dunes all afternoon to join the
happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, the support was great,'' he said. ``You feel pretty good
about making birdie, but they kind of give you an extra little
boost. When you hit a good shot, some of the kids are screaming and
yelling. It was pretty neat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ovation I got at 18, I haven't had that one in a long time
and it felt really good.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods can relate better than almost all of his contemporaries to
the youthful fury. The last time the Open was held here, Woods was
a 15-year-old high school kid.
</P>
<P>
   Probably trading Niekro baseball cards.

BILLBOARD FIRM ALLEGEDLY PAID FOR STATE OFFICIAL'S VACATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A real estate firm owned by the president of a
Massachusetts billboard company picked up the tab for two luxury
suites at Disney World in 1995 for the chairman of the state agency
that regulates the billboard industry and his family.
</P>
<P>
   Richard J. Genaitis, president of Rite Media Enterprises, said
Thursday the $6,410 hotel bill for Barton K. Hyte, chairman of the
Massachusetts Outdoor Advertising Board, and Hyte's family was paid
in February 1995 by the real estate firm affiliated with Rite
Media.
</P>
<P>
   Genaitis said his chief financial officer surreptitiously paid
the bill, and insisted he had not approved the arrangement. He also
said Hyte was unaware that the company, DORI Realty Trust, had paid
his bill.
</P>
<P>
   But a top-level former employee of Rite Media, however, told The
Globe that Hyte and Genaitis approved the payment.
</P>
<P>
   Hyte, who was reappointed last July by then-Governor William F.
Weld for a third three-year term, did not return phone calls or
respond to letters delivered to his Salem office and his home in
Marblehead.
</P>
<P>
   The payment of Hyte's vacation hotel bill is among several
allegations made by former Rite Media employees in recent months
concerning influence-peddling and fraud by Genaitis while the
company was in bankruptcy between 1994 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The allegations are being investigated by the US attorney's
office in Boston and a federal grand jury has issued subpoenas in
the case, according to documents.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources, Hyte spent about a week at Walt Disney
World with his wife, their children, and a nanny, occupying two
penthouse suites at the Hilton Hotel in Lake Buena Vista, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Genaitis said that Hyte, upon checking out of his suites, was
told the bill was being paid for by the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   However, Genaitis said Richard Walker, Rite Media's chief
financial officer at the time, had paid the bill with a check drawn
on the bank account for DORI Realty _ a trust Genaitis owned. DORI
Realty owned the Revere building, Rite Media's corporate home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he (Hyte) appreciated having his bill paid, but I'm
also sure if he'd known if we were paying it he'd have said, `No
way,''' said Genaitis.
</P>
<P>
   But an ex-employee of Rite Media, who asked not to be
identified, disputed Genaitis's account. The former employee said
Genaitis had approved paying for Hyte's family vacation lodging
beforehand _ and that Hyte knew of the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   The former employee said Genaitis picked up Hyte's tab in hopes
of gaining favorable rulings on pending applications for new
billboards.
</P>
<P>
   Genaitis said Wednesday that the Outdoor Advertising Board
turned down most of Rite Media's applications, but the agency in
1994 had approved a request to modernize a billboard in New Bedford
that likely generated more revenue for the company.
</P>
<P>
   In several telephone interviews this week, Genaitis said that in
May Rite Media was ordered to deliver its financial records to the
federal grand jury in Boston. He said he was cooperating with the
investigation and denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The DORI check which allegedly paid for Hyte's family vacation
was one of the documents turned over, Genaitis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just some garbage being spread by a couple of
ex-employees who didn't like that I had fired them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But a document filed by lawyers representing Chase Manhattan
Bank in Rite Media's bankruptcy case in April 1997 accused Genaitis
of transferring at least $382,124 by ``fraud, conversion, and
self-dealing'' from company accounts for his own benefit or the
benefit of other companies he controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Chase Manhattan was Rite Media's chief debtor, having loaned the
firm $4.5 million during the early 1990s. According to the legal
summary filed with the bankruptcy court, the bank's investigation,
which was conducted by lawyers from the Boston law firm of Hale and
Dorr, as well as independent auditors, revealed that Genaitis
allegedly had:
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Funneled $41,400 to two Rite Media subsidiaries to pay for
personal expenses;
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Directed Rite Media to pay $51,000 to purchase Central
Outdoor Co., a billboard firm, and $27,366 to pay for taxes owed by
Central Outdoor;
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Violated a court order and caused $47,250 to be paid to
himself as unauthorized salary;
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)And directed Rite Media to buy tickets for sports events
at the FleetCenter which were ``primarily'' used by Genaitis and
his wife and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   While the legal brief prepared by the Hale and Dorr lawyers
stated that these findings were supported by company records and
financial statements, it also noted that investigators had heard
additional allegations about Genaitis and Rite Media from Walker,
the billboard company's former chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the lawyers wrote, Walker had told them that
Genaitis had used ``roughly'' $19,000 of company money to ``make
contributions to local politicians with connections to the outdoor
advertising industry, so as to obtain political favors from such
politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   The bank's lawyers did not specify which politicians had
received contributions and acknowledged they did not have
``indisputable'' proof to corroborate Walker's assertions.
</P>
<P>
   Genaitis disputed the allegations contained in the Chase
Manhattan report. He said the bank wanted to control all aspects of
Rite Media's operation while it was in bankruptcy and that he had
no obligation to clear every expense with them.
</P>
<P>
   Rite Media's bankruptcy case ended last year _ and its debt to
Chase Manhattan was repaid _ after the company sold its assets,
about 100 signs in Massachusetts for $13 million to Acklerley
Communications, the largest billboard company in the state.
Genaitis has relocated his business to Florida and owns billboards
there and in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Genaitis acknowledged that he has appeared at fund-raisers for
various Massachusetts politicians, but denied making contributions
in hopes of influencing state billboard practices. Genaitis added
that Walker, whom he has accused of embezzling hundreds of
thousands of dollars from the company, was responsible for any
financial impropriety.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who pleaded guilty in November 1996 to one count of
filing a false tax return, declined to answer questions about his
work with the company. In a telephone interview Wednesday, he
denied embezzling any money from Rite Media.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``Any action I took, any money I received from the company, I
did so with the approval of Mr. Genaitis,'' Walker said.

GILLETTE CALLS MACH3 A BESTSELLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Gillette Co. released second-quarter earnings Thursday
that were in line with Wall Street's expectations but noted that in
only its second week on the market, its new Mach3 was the
best-selling razor in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Citing figures from A.C. Nielsen Corp., Gillette claimed Mach3
accounted for 35 cents &UR;  &LR;  of every dollar that Americans spent on
men's blades and razors for the week ending July 4.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the triple-blade razor was available in only about
60 percent of the country that week, it was still the nation's
best-selling razor, selling at twice the rate of other shaving
systems, according to Boston-based Gillette.
</P>
<P>
   And that was without Gillette spending ``a penny of
advertising,'' said Alfred M. Zeien, Gillette's chairman and chief
executive, who credited the media hype surrounding Mach3 as a
reason why ``people have been flocking into stores.''
</P>
<P>
   A yearlong $300 million media blitz for the Mach3 is set to
begin next month.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette began shipping Mach3 in the last week of June so Mach3
sales had little impact on the quarter that ended June 30.
</P>
<P>
   For its second quarter, Gillette said sales for all its products
dropped 2 percent to $2.33 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A strong dollar, which hurt Gillette's exports, and the
divestiture of its Jafra cosmetics unit partly accounted for the
dip. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Net income increased 11 percent to $372 million, and diluted net
income per common share was 33 cents, up 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That was in line with the estimates of analysts surveyed by
First Call Corp., a financial data company.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the 32nd consecutive quarter, our earnings per share
increased at a double-digit rate despite the continuing negative
effect of a strong dollar, softness in several key markets
including Asia'' and despite retailers' reducing their orders of
older razor lines to make room for the Mach3, Zeien said.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette said sales of its Braun electric shavers were off in
Japan and that sales for its toiletry lines, particularly its White
Rain brand, were ``down sharply.'' Sales for Sensor razors were
also lower than expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their results were impacted by weakness in Asia, Brazil, and
Mexico, the strong dollar, and retailers cutting back on Sensor
orders,'' Prudential Securities analyst Carol Warner told Bloomberg
News.
</P>
<P>
   Some skeptics contend that Gillette has grown so big and
diversified that the company won't get the same boost from Mach3
that it got from Sensor, the shaving system it launched in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette released earnings after the stock market closed. On the
New York Stock Exchange, shares rose 9/16 to close at 60 3/8.

<P>
   The New York Times News Service calls your attention to a
three-part series moving this weekend on the new identity being
forged by America's immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike immigrants of the past, many of today's new Americans are
choosing to straddle two worlds. They may live in the United
States, but with cut-rate phone cards and frequent-flier miles,
with modems, fax machines and video cameras, they can participate
in life back home with an immediacy unimagined by any previous
generation.
</P>
<P>
   The three articles will move in two forms: full length as
published in The New York Times and in abbreviated versions of
perhaps half or less of the full length. They will move on
Saturday, Sunday and Monday in the ``a'' news file and are for
publication beginning Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The budget for the series follows:
</P>
<P>
   IMMIG-IDENTITY (Undated) _ For a New York couple, many a day can
start in blaring traffic on the Grand Central Parkway Queens and
end on horseback in the verdant countryside of their native
Dominican Republic, cantering down to a river to feast on rum and
goat. They, like many modern immigrants, no longer consign their
homeland to the mist of memory or nostalgia. As the world has grown
smaller, the immigrant experience has become one of remaining
connected, economically, culturally, politically. Such a fluid
exchange between the homeland and the new land, which inevitably
alters both places, has unsettled many Americans, and this unease
underlies the current debates about immigration, multiculturalism
and bilingualism. By Deborah Sontag and Celia W. Dugger. (7,000
words.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (For use Sunday, July 19, and thereafter.) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   IMMIG-TRADITION (Jaipur, India) _ In modern immigrant families,
where the bindings between here and there are stronger than ever
before, children almost inevitably find themselves pushed and
pulled between the culture and values of their parents and those of
the larger American society. Such ambiguities are perhaps never
more acute than when a decision about marriage is at hand. But what
emerges at defining moments like Vinit Sethi's traditional Indian
wedding, arranged by his parents, is the way many of these children
search for and find solace and grounding in their connections to
the world back home. By Celia W. Dugger. (5,500 words.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (For use Monday, July 20, and thereafter.) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   IMMIG-GLOBALVILLAGE (Chinantla, Mexico) _ Almost every migration
story is the psychodrama of a family, its aspirations and
frustrations, its separations and reunions, its traditions and
compromises. For some Latin American and Caribbean immigrants, as
for the Cruz family of Chinantla, Mexico, it is also the story of a
town, a global village in the most literal sense. By Deborah
Sontag. (6,200 words.)

   Juvenile baseball leagues such as Little League can be traced
back to 1908 in rural Waynesburg, Pa., where a group of
civic-minded citizens had the inspiration of organizing an
unstructured series of baseball games into a league. The league
represented democracy in action, as sons of factory workers played
side by side with sons of the affluent. (slugged:

   As a travel writer, Shahin would like to provide summer
vacationers with sage advice on how to pack. But the truth is,
Shahin confesses, he doesn't have any tips. In fact, he doesn't
pack his bags. His wife does. This arrangement, he believes, is
quite common: Women pack the suitcases, men take pride in
methodically fitting them in the car trunk. (slugged:

 By PETER F. STEVENS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Two words pealed through the Pennsylvania air in the spring of
1908 and made history. Those words _ ``Play ball!'' _ were already
familiar across America.
 &HT;    But as they sent two baseball teams scurrying into motion on a
diamond in rural Waynesburg, a tradition was sown that would sprout
in every corner of the nation. For on that dusty diamond in
southwestern Pennsylvania, in a quintessential small-town setting,
America's first organized juvenile baseball league game was getting
under way. It was a precursor to the official Little League, that
most American of pastimes, which was not formed until 1939.
 &HT;    In 1908, Waynesburg was a thriving agricultural and banking
center with fewer than 3,000 people. Nestled near Ten Mile Creek
and bordered on the south by rolling farmland and rail fences, the
Pennsylvania hamlet differed little from any American town or big
city in at least one respect: Waynesburg teemed with farm boys and
bankers' sons alike who played baseball in any available pasture or
sandlot.
 &HT;    As with all American youths who idolized Cy Young, Honus Wagner
and the other big-league greats of the day, the youths of
Waynesburg bounded around makeshift base paths at every
opportunity. But they had little exposure to organized baseball
until high school.
 &HT;    In the spring of 1908, this changed. After a series of games
between two loosely supervised boys' clubs, a cadre of local
luminaries, including attorney Isaac N. Kuhn and journalist Guy
Ralston, noted the interest generated by the unstructured baseball
games.
 &HT;    The two men _ along with Fred High, business manager of the
Waynesburg Times newspaper, Harry Hicks, owner of a barbershop,
A.M. Nichols, and Sam Ogden _ professed ``an earnest desire . . .
to do something for the boys that will be of lasting benefit to
them,'' the weekly Waynesburg Independent (the town's other
newspaper) reported.
 &HT;    That something was the Waynesburg Juvenile Baseball League,
America's first ``Little League.''
 &HT;    The businessmen's brainstorm sent local boys scrambling to sign
up for the league's three teams: the North Side Cubs, the East
Waynesburg Winners and the Times Pirates, the latter made up
exclusively of paperboys who delivered High's newspaper.
 &HT;    Despite the Pirates' ``closed'' membership, the league was true
democracy in action: No boy was denied a spot on a team for lack of
money to buy a uniform, a cap or a glove.
 &HT;    To the delight of parents of modest or meager means, Kuhn and
the league's other backers paid for all uniforms and equipment. The
``money men'' also arranged for a 91-game schedule at a fenced
ballpark where the 9- to 14-year-old youths, proudly wearing their
team colors, would strut their stuff on the diamond.
 &HT;    The only on-field concession to the players' age came with the
league's decision to use a smaller-than-regulation-size baseball.
 &HT;    Parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters and friends paid 10
cents each to watch the three squads do battle. But when the first
echoes of pitches popping into catchers' mitts and bats cracking
into balls rose near Ten Mile Creek, the crowd saw an event far
more meaningful than mere baseball.
 &HT;    Across the field stood sons of affluence, sons of farmers and
sons of workers from the local malt plant or tinplate factory. The
world of financial castes dissolved for seven innings as
well-heeled parents rooted as boisterously for a laborer's son as
for their own.
 &HT;    No matter what their backgrounds, the players were learning
lifetime lessons beyond the virtues of teamwork and camaraderie.
The league's founders, pillars of the community, were determined to
instill in their players traditional American values of initiative
and education.
 &HT;    Kuhn and company asserted, ``We hope to be able to help the boys
... to help themselves.'' To that end, the league's creators
announced that all gate receipts would pay for a new library _ ``a
boys' library.''
 &HT;    Nearly half the town turned out for the games. And on Labor Day
of 1908, almost 3,000 fans watched a Pirates victory, the gala
event a tribute not only to the young players but also to Ralston,
Kuhn and their baseball-loving compatriots who, the Independent
reported, had all ``given their time to the boys without thought of
any return, except the boys' good will.''
 &HT;    The men earned not only the thanks of players and the community,
but they also turned a profit. With the season's ticket receipts,
Kuhn and company had accrued enough for 300 books for the boys'
library and enough to start another baseball tradition _ an awards
banquet for the players.
 &HT;    The success of America's first juvenile baseball league rippled
far beyond the banks of Ten Mile Creek, stirring something deep in
the nation's collective character. Every year, when America's boys
and girls don uniforms, adjust caps, scoop up gloves and dash onto
Little League diamonds, a welcome rite of spring and summer begins
anew.
 &HT;    Today, the legacy of the Waynesburg Cubs, Pirates and Winners of
1908 flourishes with every crack of a Little League bat.

 c.1997 Consumers Digest
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The sunshine-filled days of summer, so long awaited, have an
unfortunate downside: warm-weather health risks. Some, such as
mosquitoes, are merely annoying, but others _ such as heat stroke
or anaphylactic shock brought on by an allergic reaction to a sting
_ can be life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that almost all of these risks can be easily
minimized, if you follow some simple precautions.
 &UR; SOLAR MENACE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 40 percent to 50 percent of Americans will have a
sun-related skin cancer at least once during their lifetime,
according to the National Cancer Institute. This year, 800,000
Americans will be diagnosed with some form of skin cancer. The
culprits are ultraviolet rays A, B and C.
</P>
<P>
   UVA rays are the longest and penetrate deep into the skin,
damaging collagen, the connective tissue that keeps skin young and
firm. UVA is also the primary suspect responsible for malignant
melanoma, the most serious of sun-related cancers.
</P>
<P>
   UVB rays are medium in length, cause sunburn and seem to be
active participants in the other two types of skin cancer:
basal-cell carcinoma and squamous-cell carcinoma.
</P>
<P>
   UVC rays are mostly blocked out by the ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   For sun protection, you have two options: Stay indoors, blocking
windows during daylight hours -- UVA rays go right through the
glass -- or apply sunscreen.
</P>
<P>
   Sunscreens work by absorbing, reflecting and scattering the
sun's rays on the skin. The Sun Protection Factor, or SPF, of a
sunscreen refers to how long you can stay in the sun until your
blood vessels dilate, increasing blood flow and signifying a
sunburn. A good rule of thumb is to multiply your sunscreen's SPF
by 10 minutes to figure out how long your sun protection will last.
</P>
<P>
   Good guidelines to follow: Use a sunscreen with an SPF of at
least 15. Stay out of the sun from 10 a.m. until 3 p.m. Wear
tightly woven clothing and a hat with a large brim to shield your
face.
</P>
<P>
   If you do happen to get a sunburn, chilled aloe-vera gel or the
contents of the aloe leaf applied to burnt areas can be soothing.
Also worth trying are chilled moisturizer, plain yogurt and
cucumber slices placed strategically around the burn site.
 &UR; SUN AND EYES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eyes are also prone to damage from the sun. Cataracts and
photokeratitis, the burning of the cornea and conjunctiva, are
directly linked to the sun and UV rays. Macular degeneration is
thought to be caused by UV and blue light as well.
</P>
<P>
   Sunglasses and a broad-brimmed hat are essential tools to keep
eyes healthy. In fact, a hat alone can reduce UV exposure by 50
percent. Buy UV-blocking sunglasses marked as being 99 percent to
100 percent UV-absorbent or with labels that read ``UV absorption
up to 400nm,'' which is the same as being 100 percent UV-absorbent.
 &UR; SUN AND DEHYDRATION &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sun can harm the inside of your body as well as your skin
and eyes. Three types of dehydration occur in the summer: heat
stroke, heat exhaustion and miliaria, commonly known as heat rash
or prickly heat.
</P>
<P>
   Heat stroke is the most severe and occurs when the skin loses
its ability to cool. Your skin becomes red, hot and dry, and your
breathing and pulse become rapid. Such a scenario is very serious,
since the high fever can lead to brain damage or even death. The
best action to take is to call an ambulance and try cooling the
body with water until the ambulance arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Heat exhaustion is caused by a rise in your body's temperature
and a drop in blood pressure. Your pulse will slow down, and your
skin will appear a pasty white or gray. Symptoms are loss of
appetite, headache, nausea, cramping and fainting _ all of which
can be prevented by drinking plenty of water before you go
outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   If you think you're experiencing signs of heat exhaustion, cool
off with air conditioning and cold compresses and lie down with
your feet elevated. Sip water slowly to rehydrate your body. If the
symptoms do not go away or improve within a half-hour, go to a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A heat rash, most common in fair-skinned people, is caused by
the inflammation of sweat glands. Heat rash can be prevented by
wearing loose clothing and avoiding spicy foods, hot baths and hot
showers.
</P>
<P>
   To soothe a heat rash, dust your skin with cornstarch or talcum
powder and take lukewarm baths with two to three tablespoons of
baking soda. Drinking lots of water and noncaffeinated beverages
will help the body replenish lost liquids.
 &UR; POISONOUS PLANTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Academy of Dermatology, 10 million to
50 million people per year succumb to the itchiness, swelling and
irritation of poison ivy, oak and sumac, making these plants the
most common cause of allergic reaction in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The itchy, swelling and oozing red bumps are caused by a sap
called urushiol. Urushiol is commonly transmitted by direct
contact, although it can also be spread by touching sports
equipment, gardening tools, clothing, shoes and animal fur that has
brushed against the plant.
</P>
<P>
   If you find one of the poisonous cousins in your backyard, don't
burn it! The urushiol can become airborne and cause severe lung
damage if inhaled. Even if you come across a poisonous plant that
looks dead, beware, because the urushiol can remain potent for as
long as 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Being able to identify the plants is the best method of
protection. Poison ivy's characteristics are glossy, pointy leaves
in groups of three, seven or nine, yellow-green flowers and white
berries. It usually grows as a vine or shrub.
</P>
<P>
   Poison oak has rounded leaves, also in groups of three, seven
and nine. It has hairy yellow berries, and fuzzy leaves and trunk.
It usually grows west of the Rockies as a shrub, small tree or
vine.
</P>
<P>
   Poison sumac always has an odd number of leaves, as many as 13
per branch. This plant grows in northern wetlands and swampy areas
of the Southeast. It is usually found as a tall shrub with
smooth-edged leaves and cream-colored berries.
</P>
<P>
   An effective new way to protect skin against urushiol before
coming into contact with it is to use FDA-approved IvyBlock, a
lotion that dries to form a claylike coating.
</P>
<P>
   If you come into contact with any of the three plants,
immediately wash the skin with cold water. Don't use soap or a
cloth, as both can transport the poison to other parts of your
body. Wash all clothing and gear that also came into contact with
urushiol, preferably in chlorine bleach.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms usually occur within 12 to 24 hours after contact. A
serious case may include fever and acute inflammation. If your eyes
swell shut and you experience severe blistering, go to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   To soothe the effects of poison ivy, oak and sumac, try applying
aloe vera, calamine lotion, buttermilk or a paste or compress made
from baking soda and water.
 &UR; STINGS AND BITES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Severe allergic reactions to bumblebees, honeybees, wasps,
hornets and yellowjackets affect one in 200 Americans, most
commonly people over 30, according to the American Academy of
Allergy.
</P>
<P>
   There are several ways you can help avoid stings:
</P>
<P>
   + Wear neutral colors.
</P>
<P>
   + Don't wear shiny buckles, jewelry, perfume or scented
deodorant.
</P>
<P>
   + Cover opened soft-drink cans.
</P>
<P>
   + Keep garbage cans tightly closed.
</P>
<P>
   + Don't leave car windows open.
</P>
<P>
   + Place overripe fruit far from your picnic site to lure bees
and wasps away from your area.
</P>
<P>
   If you get stung, flick the stinger out with your fingernail, a
credit card or a knife. Never try to pull it out with your fingers.
This action could break the venom sacs on the stinger and release
more venom into the wound.
</P>
<P>
   To soothe stings, apply ice, baking-soda pastes, lemon juice,
vinegar or a deodorant containing aluminum chlorohydrate.
 &UR; MOSQUITOES AND TICKS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Your choice of effective insect repellents boils down to those
with DEET and those without, usually called natural repellents.
DEET has proven to be the most effective chemical against
mosquitoes and ticks. but you should read the label warnings about
possible side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Natural products are usually based on citronella, a
lemon-scented Asian grass. If you choose to use a non-DEET
repellent, it should be reapplied often. Although citronella-based
repellents work well against mosquitoes, they have not proven to be
effective against ticks.
</P>
<P>
   Always check to make sure that any repellent you buy has an
Environmental Protection Agency registration number, indicating
that the product has been reviewed by the EPA and can be used with
minimal-to-low risk if the label instructions are followed.
</P>
<P>
   If you do get attacked, try applying baking-soda pastes,
swabbing the skin with witch hazel or taking baths with four cups
of baking soda to three cups of salt.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1994, almost 100 years after his maternal grandfather left
Oliveto-Citra, Italy, to come to America, Dr. Louis Greco sat in
the town's city hall looking at an ancestor's birth certificate.
For the 73-year-old retired physician from Boone, Iowa, the trip to
the mountain village came some 40 years after he first talked to
his grandmother about her background and forebears.
</P>
<P>
   Greco's passion for his family history isn't unusual. Many
Americans become interested in their family's past after attending
reunions, holiday celebrations or funerals, where they hear stories
about distant relatives or realize they don't know a grandmother's
maiden name.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for the past 20 years or so, the number of Americans
looking into their family histories has soared. Today some 113
million people _ four in 10 adults _ say they are interested in
genealogy.
</P>
<P>
   Starting from scratch may seem overwhelming, but chances are you
already have some pieces to fit into your genealogical puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   First, write down the names of your family members as far back
as you can remember. Try to gather any written records, such as
birth, death and marriage certificates, in order to confirm or add
details. Pursue other personal sources _ family Bibles, diplomas,
old letters and diaries, photographs _ that provide additional
clues.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to interview your relatives. The National
Genealogical Society recommends asking basic questions about their
lives and those of other family members. Where did they live? What
kind of dwelling? Did they move around while growing up? When were
their relatives born? When did they die? Consider using audiotape
or videotape to record these interviews.
</P>
<P>
   When dealing with family members you've never met, initiate
contact by letter. Several genealogical books also include
extensive questionnaires that you can send to relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Although experts agree that information obtained orally from
relatives is invaluable, Shirley Langdon Wilcox, president of the
NGS, adds, ``Remember that stories aren't going to be 100-percent
correct, but they're a good starting point.''
 &UR; FOLLOW THE LEADS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wilcox says that most amateur genealogists encounter apparent
dead ends. For example, one common problem is the assumption that
the current spelling of a family name is the way it has always been
spelled. Wilcox reminds researchers that people wrote down names as
they heard them.
</P>
<P>
   If you're having trouble with a name, think about how it might
have been pronounced with a strong accent by an immigrant arriving
in the United States, or how it might have sounded to someone who
didn't know the language _ an immigration official, for example.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have written documentation for your family, you can
obtain vital records from government sources. Both birth and death
certificates contain names of parents and, often, mothers' maiden
names. However, this information is only as reliable as the person
who provided it.
</P>
<P>
   Each state has different laws governing public access to
records. The Department of Health and Human Services publishes a
helpful guide, ``Where to Write for Vital Records: Births, Deaths,
Marriages and Divorces,'' which provides specific information for
each state.
</P>
<P>
   Census records offer a wealth of information. At the New York
Public Library's U.S. History, Local History and Genealogy
Division, reference librarians often advise beginners who know that
relatives immigrated before 1920 to start their search by looking
at the 1920 census. From that they can learn such key data as the
name of the head of the family and the year of immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Although federal law restricts public access to recent censuses,
records dating back 72 years or more can be found at the National
Archives in Washington, its dozen regional branches and a number of
specialized genealogical collections.
</P>
<P>
   The archives also publishes two helpful booklets: ``Guide to
Genealogical Research in the National Archives'' and ``Military
Service Records in the National Archives of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   More advanced researchers can go on to search probate records
and wills, deeds and land records, military and pension records,
naturalization petitions, church and cemetery records, and
immigration records, including ships' passenger lists.
</P>
<P>
   Public and university libraries and historical societies with
extensive genealogical collections exist across the nation. The
Family History Library of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
Saints in Salt Lake City is a huge repository of genealogical data
for people of every religion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are 2,600 Family History Centers throughout
North America, where researchers can comb through the Mormons'
extensive microfilm holdings, including European records that are
unavailable elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Family History Centers and other genealogical
organizations have culled materials from Americans' countries of
origin, particularly Europe, some researchers, like Greco, pursue
their search outside the United States. The availability of records
varies. In general, your success will depend on how well a
particular country has maintained written records and how
accessible they are.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland, for instance, encourages people of Irish ancestry to
visit its villages, churches and cemeteries. The Irish Tourist
Board publishes an information-packed brochure, ``Tracing Your
Ancestors,'' which includes a map correlating family names to their
counties of origin.
 &UR; ON-LINE INTELLIGENCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, there's a good deal of genealogical
information available on-line. Making a connection to almost any
Web site on genealogy will lead you to countless more resources,
such as the Ellis Island Web site.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, people share information via chat groups on such
services as America Online. However, experts caution that not all
information posted is accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers trying to locate ancestors from Eastern Europe
should keep in mind that country borders have changed, and towns
that were once part of the Austro-Hungarian empire are now part of
such countries as Poland and Romania.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``From Generation to Generation: How to Trace Your
Jewish Genealogy and Personal History'' (Harper Collins, 1994),
Arthur Kurzweil suggests consulting maps and gazetteers _ and
considering a variety of spellings _ to find the name of a place
where your ancestors lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you learn the name of the town,'' he writes, ``try to
find out where it was near.''
</P>
<P>
   His book includes a list of village names and the countries in
which they were located, based on a 1939 map.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've collected names, dates and copies of records, the
data can be organized in several ways. Many experienced
genealogists recommend using pedigree and family-group charts, and
birth, death and marriage forms. These charts and forms are
available from bookstores, mail-order catalogs and the National
Genealogical Society.
</P>
<P>
   Genealogical computer software is also an option. One of the
most popular programs, Family Tree Maker, offers a feature called
World Family Tree Project, which allows researchers to share
information with one another and makes available individual family
genealogies.
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of posterity, Janet Haase, owner of the
Genealogy House bookstore in Minneapolis, urges amateur
genealogists to record their information in some permanent form.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to get information in long-lasting form that
can be passed among family members,'' says Haase, adding that all
copies should be made on archival-quality paper.
</P>
<P>
   Whether your goal is to trace your family tree as far back as
possible, to collect hundreds of cousins or to visit an ancestor's
birthplace, as Greco did, genealogy is a rewarding hobby.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why he's pursued genealogy with such zeal, Greco says
that it's to ``pass on something to the children.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, he adds, ``Writing it all down is a way to achieve
immortality.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Once summer arrives, one need only lean out the window to hear
the sound of the season: the zipping of suitcases. Doesn't matter
where you live, Madrid or Milwaukee, every town will empty itself
of residents and be filled again with tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans will be coming to America. Americans will be going to
Europe. Like racers at the starting gate, vacationers are ready to
bolt from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Before any of them can go anywhere, though, they first have to
pack.
</P>
<P>
   As a travel writer, I'd like to help by providing tips for
efficient and effortless packing. Suggest, perhaps, rolling your
shirts rather than folding them. Divulge other little secrets of
the travel writer's trade.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I can't. I don't have any secrets. I don't pack.
</P>
<P>
   Back when I did pack, I inevitably got bored halfway through it,
went and read on the couch and eventually blew off the whole thing
until the following morning, when, in a panic, I'd throw a bunch of
stuff in a suitcase and rush out the door to catch my waiting cab.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was this decidedly not the way to begin a trip, but it
was also expensive. Upon arriving at my destination, I'd discover
that I'd forgotten my toothbrush or neckties or razor. Little
things, to be sure, but they added up, especially with the price of
annoyance factored in.
</P>
<P>
   I have found that aimlessly walking the streets of some exotic
locale, admiring its architecture, maybe stopping for a nibble and
a drink somewhere, is generally preferable to spending one's first
few jetlagged hours searching through neighborhoods for an open
store in which to purchase things you already own.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't much I ask of my wife that I wouldn't do myself. I
cook. I clean. But packing, that's her job.
</P>
<P>
   It was not always this way. I used to help. Gradually, though, I
started devising ways to avoid the dreaded task.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes my excuse would be that I needed to make a sudden trip
to the store for something I'd claim was essential for the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pens. Damn, I forgot pens. What if I get an idea on the plane?
Listen, I'll be right back. Would you mind just tossing that blue
shirt into the suitcase while I'm out, so I don't forget?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get stuck at the store awhile, maybe you could also pack
those black pants I like, the ones with the cuffs. Oh, and socks.
What, seven days, seven pairs? Maybe a couple extra, just in case.
See ya soon as I can get back. Thanks, hon.''
</P>
<P>
   Other times I'd feign an illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was something I ate,'' I'd say. ``I don't know, but
I'm not feeling so good. If it's OK, I'm going to lie down for a
while. If you need anything, I'll be on the couch.''
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the ruse wore thin and my wife, taking the path of
least resistance, simply assumed the role of designated packer. So
she is now the one who deliberates over the nature of the trip and
chooses the appropriate wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, it may seem as though she got the raw end of the
deal. But she has received something extremely valuable in return:
my silence. For her, not having to listen to my constant whining is
probably reward enough.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, our arrangement also means that I don't
interfere. But I sometimes feel the need to exert control over a
project, even if it is not one I particularly want to be involved
in. It's a male thing.
</P>
<P>
   I'll wander into the bedroom while she's placing a pair of
carefully folded trousers into the suitcase and ask as nonchalantly
as possible, ``Did you remember the Hot Sauce Festival T-shirt?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim'' is her one-word reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just asking,'' I say. ``If there's room, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   I then leave the room, satisfied that I've overseen the
situation and it all seems in order.
</P>
<P>
   I have no survey or poll to back me on this _ which, I
recognize, is the only real way to legitimize one's observations in
contemporary America _ but I daresay that the packing deal we've
worked out is fairly common.
</P>
<P>
   I think it goes back to some mother-son thing. It was, no doubt,
Mom who packed the bags for camp and Mom who packed the lunch for
school and Mom who packed the overnight backpack for sleepovers.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why this whole women being from Venus and men being
from Mars thing seems a little ``Duh!'' to me. We all know that men
see themselves as warriors. Whether they're talking sports, cars or
music, you can hear the language of competition in their speech.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is not unreasonable to ask, ``Since when do warriors
pack their own underwear?'' The very image of Attila the Hun trying
to decide between warmongering outfits before going on a rampage
seems a bit farfetched to me. I don't know if Attila the Hun had a
wife, but if he did, I bet she did the packing.
</P>
<P>
   A woman friend of mine maintains that her boyfriend does his own
packing, and that he prefers it that way. I have a hard time
believing this.
</P>
<P>
   But she also tells me something that makes it plausible. He
packs badly. He tosses ill-fitting clothes into an old beat-up
thing that he drags around the world heedlessly.
</P>
<P>
   To rectify this, for Christmas she bought him an expensive new
bag, and before a business trip to New York she took him to a
clothier so he could get something decent to put in it. It's my
contention that, because he now has a nice bag and nice things to
go inside, he'll no longer trust himself to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'm wrong about all of this. Maybe most men pack their own
suitcases and pack the family suitcases as well. But it has been my
experience that, when it comes to travel, the only things men pack
are car trunks.
</P>
<P>
   They take the suitcases and bags and methodically arrange them
one by one, fitting them just so. I wouldn't be surprised if some
men are so engrossed by this that their tongues hang out of their
mouths like little boys working on a hard math problem.
</P>
<P>
   When they finish packing the car, they stand back from their
handiwork for a few seconds to admire it. That's a good pack job,
the look on their faces says.
</P>
<P>
   I can't say why packing a car is more satisfying to men than
packing a suitcase. I just know that that's how it is: Men pack
cars, women pack suitcases.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a book. I hope my wife doesn't forget to pack it.

 By PAULA GANZI LICATA  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    I have waited for most of my life for fair skin to be
fashionable. At long last, in recent years the healthy trend of
shunning the sun has gained popularity.
 &HT;    While some are still seeking the sun-drenched look with safe,
sun-free tans offered by products such as Neutrogena and Bain de
Soleil's sunless tanning sprays, many are opting for pale. Movie
stars and fashion models, the barometer of female beauty, are
flashing fair flesh.
 &HT;    No one could appreciate this revolution more than I. Too easily
burned, I speak from the experience of many long, hot, colorless
summers. I rubbed on sunscreen, and I paid the price of unpopular
pale. For years I suffered through shouts of ``Yo, milk!'' while
all those bronzed bodies in string bikinis strolled by.
 &HT;    But I wasn't always this smart. Etched in my memory are the days
I would set out determined to get a tan _ no matter the cost. I
would lie and soak up as much sun as I could stand. Most of my
friends loved this part: The Big Bake. I hated it.
 &HT;    I could feel the sting of sweat mixed with chemicals from the
lotion. The sun's rays penetrated my sunglasses, through the
tissues I had saturated in cold water, and irritated my eyes. I
could feel my skin being drained of every molecule of moisture.
 &HT;    After a day at the beach, the others came home rested and brown
_ the ultimate goal, aside from meeting bronzed, Adonis-like men _
and I came home exhausted, itchy and burned.
 &HT;    But I persisted. I tried all the deep-tanning, tropical lotions
_ the pina colada ``smell-alikes'' _ only to come home with a rash.
When I greased up in pure baby oil, I fried like a piece of bacon.
The quick-tanning stuff tinted my skin orange.
 &HT;    Self-acceptance finally arrived. Mom was right _ I realized I
would forever resemble the ``before'' picture in a Coppertone
advertisement.
 &HT;    I took comfort in the knowledge that I would never get that
tough, leather-like skin _ the sun worshippers' reward. The rest of
the year I would have the peaches-and-cream complexion that the
sallow, olive-skinned population would envy. And I would never have
to worry about wrinkles due to the sun or melanoma.
 &HT;    At age 20, I bade farewell to the tan and the sun-drenched.
Feeling more confident about my long white legs and alabaster skin,
I began anew. Gone were the days of panic and pressure to battle
beach traffic on a hot summer day.
 &HT;    And then I met Robert, who loved to bake on the beach. So I
compromised. I can now be spotted on the beach beneath a large
umbrella, outfitted in a coat of sunblock, a man greased in oil
lying in the sun by my side.
 &HT;    Every summer there are more umbrellas on the beach. And each
season brings more sun products to the shelves. The SPF numbers are
getting higher, and baby oil is slipping as a serious contender.
Ads now boast, ``Rethinking the beach: the new wave in sun care,''
``Smart fun in the sun'' and ``Shun peak sun: If your shadow is
shorter than you are, run for shade.''
 &HT;    It does this fair-skinned woman good to see signs of change in a
world that once defined beauty as a California tan. Will the future
resemble the days of Scarlett O'Hara, when parasols protected ivory
skin?
 &HT;    I think not. The most I can hope for is equal rights: the right
not to be asked if I've been ill all summer or trapped in a dark
cave for the past few months.

</P>
<P>
   A Chinese proverb says, ``No family can hang out the sign,
`Nothing the matter here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Every family has its issues, its patches of unresolved conflict,
its difficult personalities who will most likely remain difficult
until death relieves them of all difficulty. Few of us view all
family members with unalloyed adoration.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that anxieties and ambivalences, regrets and
doubts, are not incompatible with love. And families _ even those
that are slightly nuts _ are not incompatible with growth and
change.
</P>
<P>
   Family reunions can be a time and place in which relationships
out of kilter can be put back on track again. What has been left
dangling can be connected. Those most prone to being left outside
looking in can be drawn across the threshold and into the heart of
the family.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the prospect of a family reunion raises uncomfortable
feelings bordering on dread, as memories of less-than-perfect
relationships with family surface. But with a bit of thoughtful
effort, relationships can improve, and reunions are just the place
to strengthen what's right and valuable in them.
</P>
<P>
   Below are common family problems and tactical responses for
coping with them. Some responses were suggested by family
therapists Evan ImberBlack and Janine Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Should we invite my uncle, the family black sheep, to the
reunion?
</P>
<P>
   Unless a relative has committed a heinous, unforgivable crime _
failing to call Grandmother at Christmas is not in this category _
he or she should be invited to the reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps your family _ or at least you _ are now prepared to cope
with, even enjoy, what makes other family members different. And
perhaps the black sheep was not all that radically different to
start with.
</P>
<P>
   How can those who feel outside the family loop _ single people,
middle-aged people who haven't had kids, gays or freewheeling
artist types _ take their place in the family circle?
</P>
<P>
   If possible, those who feel like outsiders should try to get
involved in the reunion planning. By doing so, they help create the
reunion in their own image and bond with other family members in a
shared effort. As a result, they're viewed by those attending as
family insiders.
</P>
<P>
   Those who don't meet certain family expectations should try
before the reunion to figure out what common ground they do have
with other family members and build on that: an interest in family
history, for example, or being terrific with young children. They
can then sponsor a genealogical workshop at the reunion, for
instance, or help in the crafts cabin, emphasizing aspects that
they share with other family members.
</P>
<P>
   What if I have a major issue I want to settle with a family
member _ or a big family secret that has been unconfessed for
years?
</P>
<P>
   Reunions should not be used as a forum in which to work through
long-standing issues before a large, live audience. If you have a
bone of contention with a relative, deal with it person-to-person.
Plan in advance to take an hour or two out of the reunion and go
off by yourselves to talk things over. What this approach lacks in
drama, it makes up for in effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   What do I say to relatives who've gone through hard times _
fighting cancer or losing a job or getting divorced? Or maybe I
shouldn't say anything at all?
</P>
<P>
   Keeping silent isn't the answer. Better to make some kind of
supportive remark than simply ignore the situation. The person
who's been going through a difficult time can pick up on your
expression of concern or shut down conversation. Take the cue, and
respect it. But often they will welcome the reaching out, and a
reunion is a good time for it.
</P>
<P>
   As one recently divorced woman said shortly after her family
reunion, ``I was dreading the reunion. I felt like such a failure.
The divorce was so raw, like an open wound. But at the reunion I
felt such acceptance from the family that I could let down my
defenses.''
</P>
<P>
   What can I do to get my spouse interested in the reunion?
</P>
<P>
   The archetypal inlaw at a reunion is a reluctant person who
would rather break rocks in the hot sun than struggle through an
exchange of small talk with Great-Aunt Dorothy. But handled with
care, a spouse can be brought into the fold, more or less
painlessly. Here are a few guidelines:
</P>
<P>
   Request only one command performance a day. Then let your spouse
go his or her own way _ fishing, golfing, to the mall or back to
bed.
</P>
<P>
   Limit dwelling in the past. Sure, a reunion can bring inlaws
into the family culture by imparting family stories, history and
Uncle Ed's really bad jokes, but few spouses can cope with a
nonstop immersion into a family's past.
</P>
<P>
   Suggest reunion activities that your spouse actually likes. If
the reunion features his or her kind of fun _ fishing, golf,
sailing _ he or she will be happy to return the next time.
</P>
<P>
   Give your spouse the family he or she has always wanted. If you
cajole your significant other into attending the reunion, and lay
off his or her case once there, your spouse might discover for
himself what the reunion has to offer _ more people to love and be
loved by.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad deal at all.
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; SIDEBAR: TEN COMMANDMENTS OF REUNION ETIQUETTE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A reunion isn't controlled by protocol, as a wedding is. And
each family cultivates its own idiosyncrasies. Still, a few laws do
govern reunions _ laws that must be followed lest the world be
thrown into chaos and confusion. And we don't want that.
</P>
<P>
   So, with the help of Judith Martin, also known as Miss Manners,
we've drawn up the following commandments.
</P>
<P>
   1. Thou shalt not forget thine ordinary manners nor thy common
civility, just because thou art among thy brothers and sisters.
</P>
<P>
   2. Thou shalt tolerate thy tiresome relative _ at least for a
little while.
</P>
<P>
   3. Thou shalt not play footsie with a distant cousin or thy
cousin's spouse.
</P>
<P>
   4. Sniping and carping about a reunion's lack of organization is
an abomination.
</P>
<P>
   5. Thou shalt orchestrate spontaneous praise unto the reunion
organizer.
</P>
<P>
   6. Thou shalt not talk about everything under the sun. Agree to
disagree, and steer clear of such topics as abortion rights, gay
marriage or gun control.
</P>
<P>
   7. Parents shall not use intimate details of their kids' lives
as conversational fodder. Boasts of children's accomplishments are
acceptable, but parents shall be discreet in their phrasing and
timing.
</P>
<P>
   8. Thou shalt not reveal devastating family secrets about
thyself or others unless thou hast arranged therapeutic support
systems.
</P>
<P>
   9. Thou shalt not publicly criticize the manners or behavior of
any child not thine own.
</P>
<P>
   10. Thou shalt flatter thy kinfolk _ falsely or not. All nieces
tap dance divinely, all babies are beautiful and all aunts look as
wonderful as ever.

 &HT;    Flying in the face of adversity
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Carolyn Loudenslager, president of the Bud Light
Air Force, has not lived a normal life.
</P>
<P>
   If she ever expected to, she should have known better.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Leo, was an aviation legend: seven-time U.S.
aerobatic champion, airplane designer, airline pilot and founder of
the Bud Light team _ the team that will fly the Bud Light Micro Jet
at this weekend's United States Air and Trade Show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember my first airplane flight. I was probably 2
months old,'' Carolyn Loudenslager said Thursday. ``I remember my
first flight with my dad. I rode on his lap'' in his single-seat
Bud Light 200, a propeller-powered show plane her father had built
himself.
</P>
<P>
   But Loudenslager's crowd-thrilling air show flights did not
thrill her, and she did not share his passion for airplanes or
flight. She studied political science in college and had no plans
to join her father's air show business.
</P>
<P>
   That changed abruptly in June 1997, when Leo was fatally injured
in an accident _ not in an airplane, but on his motorcycle near his
home near Memphis, Tenn., when a car swerved into his lane and hit
him head-on.
</P>
<P>
   Between his air show travels and his airline flying, Carolyn had
never seen much of of her father, even less after her parents
divorced when she was 13.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, he was gone. All that remained was the Bud Light team,
and its future was in question.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Loudenslager said the team's members _ pilots Bill
``Burner'' Beardsley and Jack ``Elk'' Ekl, and crew chief Bill
``Big B'' Beardsley, Burner's father _ did not know what their
sponsor, St. Louis-based Anheuser-Busch Co., would want to do with
the team. They started negotiations that would run through the rest
of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the team needed someone to call president. Carolyn
took the title. ``But I really was a glorified secretary,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she calculated what it would cost to keep the team
together. It was much more than Anheuser-Busch had offered, but
Loudenslager went to face the big beer company herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured there was no way they were going to pay us what we
needed,'' she said. ``I figured I was signing off... I was sort of
brazen about it. But they essentially gave us what we wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, at age 22, Carolyn manages one of the air show circuit's
highest-profile acts, helping a close-knit team stay together while
trying to come to terms with her own loss and trying to figure out
where her own life is going.
</P>
<P>
   She cannot fill her father's shoes. She is not a pilot, although
she has begun taking flying lessons. But she said she manages the
business side of the team more closely than her father ever did
while he juggled air show and airline flying with designing a new
show plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our schedule this year is the best we've had in 10 years,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   But her pride is tempered by thoughts of what might have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I get into this, the more I think, Gosh, I wish Dad
could have been here because we would have made the perfect team,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she admits she has not found the spark that fired her
father's aviation passion.
</P>
<P>
   While airplanes interest her, she said, ``I'll never be an
aviation enthusiast.... I don't know how long I'll be doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, she is waiting until next week to learn whether
Anheuser-Busch will sponsor the team next year. Every year, the Bud
Light Air Force must compete for its share of the company's
advertising budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really see my future past next year,'' she said.
``Whatever I find out next week is the fate that's meant to be.
I've come to peace with it.'' CONTACT Timothy R. Gaffney by e-mail

   GLASS-COLUMN _ The digital revolution runs at warp speed.
Consider that when Bill Clinton arrived in the White House, hardly
anyone had even heard of the Internet. By the time Clinton's moving
van drives off, presumably in January 2001, 60 per cent of U.S.
families are expected to be full netizens.
</P>
<P>
   But the real issue is what kind of access we'll have, and at
what cost. And on that score, the signs look promising. (Glass, Cox

<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Congressional Republicans who are worried their
lousy environmental voting records may hurt them at the polls have
created a fake environmental organization and have started giving
each other trophies that declare them environmental champions _
something to show the home folks. It is a scam of breathtaking
brazenness. (Teepen, Cox News Service) MOVED.

<P>
   CSIBLEY-COLUMN _ My New York editor friend, Larry Ashmead,
clearly thinks I am a nut about picnics. And, of course, he is
right. I come from a long line of women, even old ladies in their
80s, who often said, ``Let's take dinner and go to the woods.'' Our
theory is that whatever you have to eat tastes better under the
open sky, and ants in the cake and sand in the salad never bothered
one of us a whit. (Sibley, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED

   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ While sitting in on a televised
panel discussion on race, a big ol' white boy from Arkansas
startled viewers around the country when he solemnly announced that
he was a minority. He's part Cherokee, he said. Until that moment,
everyone in America thought this man was just a big, ol' white boy
from Arkansas who happened to be president of the United States.

 &HT;    All ears
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 19: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You just don't hear, ``Ooh, girl, those earrings are sharp,''
uttered as often or as enthusiastically as you used to.
</P>
<P>
   Close inspection of the latest looks in earwear proves that
``sharp'' doesn't apply at all. The more apt word to describe the
best earring styles out now is ``nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Nice as in: classy, compact, feminine and fuss-free.
</P>
<P>
   Fashionable ear wear doesn't cry out for attention by virtue of
its size, color or brilliance. Even the gemstone earrings currently
in style now manage to sparkle without screaming to be noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Factors to consider when choosing additions to your earring
wardrobe include:
</P>
<P>
   -- Does it hug the earlobe, rather than dangle daredevilishly
from it?
</P>
<P>
   -- Is it delicately crafted, or heavy-duty in construction?
</P>
<P>
   -- Are colored gemstones, pearls or crushed diamonds the focal
point of the earrings; or are they merely tried-and-true hoops or
studs?

 &HT;    Artists find creative outlet fashioning color, texture in their
pieces
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 19: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most of us think art is something you hang on a wall.
</P>
<P>
   Not Sister Mary Kay Finneran. For morning prayers, the nun wraps
her shoulders in an earth-toned wool shawl hand-woven by Atlanta
area artist Judith Krone. ``I don't make fashion statements,'' says
Sister Mary Kay. ``When I wear Judith's shawl, it's like being
wrapped in love. People will come up to me and touch it. They want
to feel its texture, which is what a piece of woven art is all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Community volunteer Lucy Hutchinson gets the same reaction when
she wears her cotton fly-fishing vest hand-woven and custom-dyed by
Atlanta weaver Lynn Nickerson. ``Everyone's intrigued by the bright
colors,'' she says. ``I love to wear it with jeans and a
turtleneck. It's a timeless piece that I will keep forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Krone and Nickerson are two of seven Georgia weavers whose
wearable art will be showcased at fashion shows Friday night during
Convergence '98: Rhythms &AMP; Hues, the international weavers'
conference at the Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel and Atlanta Market
Center. Juried by Holly Brubach, style editor of The New York Times
Magazine, the show features one-of-a-kind jackets, dresses, coats
and accessories. The weavers hail from 25 states and six countries.
</P>
<P>
   Brubach evaluated 187 photo entries before paring it down to 92.
Her judging criteria? ``Cut, in terms of how the outfit falls on
the body, color, details and innovation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the outfits can be worn, some run the risk of wearing
you,'' Brubach says.
</P>
<P>
   One that falls into the latter category is the 20-pound
``Penny'' dress, a long black strapless gown covered with
double-weave pockets. Pennies were tucked into the pockets by
student weaver Shannon Hamblett of the Kansas City Art Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Wearable pieces from Georgians include: Linda Jarrett's colorful
cropped suede-and-cotton jacket; Christine Stanton's cranberry wool
tent coat; and Roxanne Brown's green-gold-rust chenille jacket and
scarf.
</P>
<P>
   Judging the weavers' work, Brubach says, was educational. ``I
don't know that much about weaving,'' she admits. ``But I sensed
that the weavers were aiming for fashionable garments, not just
pieces of beautiful woven fabric.
</P>
<P>
   ``That, for me, took the clothes to the next level of
sophistication.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, the weavers sell their creations through referrals or
through small boutiques. Others sell at festivals and art shows.
Individual pieces take two weeks to two months to weave. Prices
range from $200 for a shawl to more than $3,000 for a
special-occasion dress.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantan Janet Bealer, who's woven for 25 years, compares the
craft to dance. ``Once you start, there's a rhythm,'' she says.
``And it's meditative.''

 &HT;    Living facility rebuked by state
 &HT;    By Kevin Wishard
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GEORGETOWN, Texas _ Texas Department of Human Services officials
have reprimanded a Georgetown assisted-living center for negligence
after an 83-year-old resident who fell asleep during a sightseeing
outing was left in a parked bus for five hours as the temperature
reached 97 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The woman was unconscious and suffering from heat exhaustion and
hyperthermia when discovered by center staff members, who failed to
search for her despite repeatedly recognizing her absence, state
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson County District Attorney Ken Anderson said that
Georgetown police are investigating the incident, which happened
July 8 at Park Place Assisted Living.
</P>
<P>
   It occurred during a stretch when temperatures climbed into the
high 90s and low 100s. The excessive heat has claimed the lives of
27 people across Texas so far this summer, and many victims have
been older people whose health problems were exacerbated by the
heat. Officials in Dallas County, where 18 heat-related deaths have
been reported, declared a state of emergency on July 14.
</P>
<P>
   July 16 was the 24th day this year that Dallas hit temperatures
of 100 degrees or more. It was the 14th day for Austin, according
to the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Austin area has seen one heat-related death _ a
56-year-old woman whose body was found May 28 on the railroad track
along North MoPac Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   State investigators said the temperature in the Austin area was
87.8 degrees when Park Place staff members found the resident lying
on the back seat of the bus at 10 p.m. At 4 p.m., when staffers
first noticed she was missing, the temperature was 97 degrees. The
report states the woman was unresponsive and had a temperature of
106.8 degrees when she arrived at Georgetown Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, whose name and condition were unavailable, remains
hospitalized. A report by state investigators said that had
suffered kidney failure, and her attending physician told
investigators last week her prognosis was poor.
</P>
<P>
   State investigators cited several problems at Park Place,
including failure to keep track of the number of passengers on the
bus, a breakdown in communications between staff members at shift
changes, a lack of training and policy directing staff members what
to do when a resident is missing, and failure to have sufficient
staff on duty to ensure appropriate resident care.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators reprimanded the center for negligence and failure
to protect the health and safety of residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most severe action we could take short of closing the
facility,'' said Rosemary Patterson, a Department of Human Services
spokeswoman. ``This was a systems breakdown. ... We're very
concerned that something like this could happen.''
</P>
<P>
   State investigators have recommended the agency's legal
department ask the attorney general's office to pursue penalties
against the center. The maximum penalty that could assessed against
an assisted-living center is $10,000 per day in fines, said Ward
Tisdale, a spokesman for the attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the center, which is home to 29 residents, said
that policies have been implemented to correct all the deficiencies
turned up by state investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The state's report shows Park Place staff members realized the
resident was absent first at 4 p.m., again at 5 p.m., and again at
7:45 p.m. However, they did not begin searching for her until 9:45,
when administrator Jean Cagle was told the woman was still missing.
</P>
<P>
   Park Place officials, in a news release issued Thursday, said
staff members were not alarmed at the woman's absence because
residents frequently leave the center with family members.
Officials also stated that state-required sign-out procedures were
in place but inconsistently applied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our residents are active and independent. They come and go as
they please, and several residents even drive their own cars,''
Cagle said. ``This has been a terribly unfortunate incident, and we
are each personally affected and profoundly saddened.''
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the bus did not tell other staff members the names
of the eight residents who were on the outing, investigators
reported. Upon returning to the center around 4:15 p.m., the driver
did not notice that the woman did not get out of the van. She did
not see anyone on the bus, but did not check to see whether it was
empty before parking it in the center's back lot and locking the
doors, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Cagle and other residents told investigators that the woman had
a history of falling asleep in various places.
</P>
<P>
   State records show investigations of three other complaints
against Park Place since it opened in February 1997. Only one, in
which a former employee was accused of asking a resident to sign
over a check, was substantiated, and center officials turned the
matter over to Georgetown police, records show.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson said Human Services officials will make an unannounced
inspection to see whether the center has corrected its problems. If
deficiencies are found, further licensing action could be taken,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Travis County chief medical examiner Robert Bayardo said Austin
resident Erma Graves, 56, was found dead May 28 in the 12700 block
of North MoPac Boulevard. The temperature that day was high, and
when an investigation revealed no other cause, the death was ruled
as heat-related, Bayardo said.

 &HT;    Goodwill Games running strong
 &HT;    By John Maher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Goodwill Games were born in 1986, after
back-to-back Olympic boycotts, as Ted Turner's extravagant way of
getting the super powers back on the same playing field. But, since
the first games were held in Moscow, the Berlin Wall has fallen,
the Soviet Union has fractured and much of the old East- West
animosity has evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   The Goodwill Games, however, have survived, or perhaps refused
to go away. Cynics might call them Turner's Folly because they lost
more than $100 million in their first three incarnations. Now, over
the next 15 days they will have wrestlers, triathletes,
synchronized swimmers and gymnasts competing for the attention of
subway sports fans whose idea of global competition is the Mets vs.
the Yankees or the Giants vs. the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   But these Goodwill Games, which will have 1,300 athletes from 60
countries competing for $5 million in prize money, will make their
mark, perhaps as early as today when U.S. sprint sensation Marion
Jones runs the 100 meters. The games have become an oasis for
athletes who once had to wander four years in a competitive desert
between Olympics, and they're becoming a real windfall for the best
performers as bonuses for world records will be as much as
$100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never been a more lucrative track meet on American
soil,'' said Dan Pfaff, an assistant track coach at the University
of Texas and a veteran of international competition. ``I guarantee
every American coach has pointed for this. The Africans are geeked
up because of the prize money. The distance runners could be
scorching. If they get some good weather there it could be better
than the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   The swimming competition will feature Russian Alexander Popov, a
double gold medalist in the Atlanta Olympics, and an us. vs. them
format in which teams from the United States, Germany, Russia,
China and the World All-Stars will swim head-to-head in a
succession of dual meets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something new to make it move viewer friendly. It's
almost like college dual meets,'' said Austin's Josh Davis, a
three-time gold medalist at the Atlanta Olympics who will be
swimming the 200-meter freestyle and 200 individual medley and on a
relay here.
</P>
<P>
   ``In college there's not a person sitting in the whole place
during the relays, and these should all come down to the last
relay. The teams are that close.''
</P>
<P>
   The diving competition could be the biggest yet for a UT recruit
touted as the next Greg Lougainis, Troy Dumais, and UT's Laura
Wilkinson will challenge on the women's side.
</P>
<P>
   Figure skating will have the elegance of Michelle Kwan, and
women's gymnastics will have a pair of 'Niques, Dominique Dawes and
Dominique Moceanu. The U.S. team that can actually play soccer, the
women, will be on hand with a team that includes Mia Hamm and
Michelle Akers.
</P>
<P>
   In Central Park, men's and women's two-person teams, including
legend Sinjin Smith and the team of Karch Kiraly and Adam Johnson,
will be kicking up the imported sand.
</P>
<P>
   In track, often the showcase event at Olympic-style
competitions, Michael Johnson was slated to be the star. But
Johnson, a record-setting double gold medalist in Atlanta, is
coming back from injuries and will not compete in the 200 meters,
only the 400 meters and the 1,600-meter relay.
</P>
<P>
   With Johnson not quite 100 percent, the sprint star of these
Games could very well turn out to be Jones. She certainly doesn't
lack for confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I train to be the best,'' Jones said recently. ``Second place
isn't good enough. If I'm at my best I can't be beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 22, was a high school phenom in California. She qualified
for the 1992 Olympic team as an alternate for the relays but
declined to compete. In college, her track career had to share time
with her basketball dreams. She was a guard on the North Carolina
team that won a national championship. In 1996, in what should have
been a showcase year, Jones sat out the Olympics because of a
broken foot.
</P>
<P>
   This year, she's been making up for lost time. Jones recently
became the first U.S. woman in 50 years to capture three national
titles, winning the 100- and 200-meter races and the long jump. Her
100-meter race today figures to get the Goodwill Games off to a
fast start.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has run a time of 10.71 seconds for that distance, and
only Florence Griffith-Joyner's 10.49 in 1988 is faster.
Griffith-Joyner's record was once thought to be unbreakable, but
there's now talk that Jones might be able to do it. She has said
she's capable of getting all three world records and would like to
get five gold medals, including two in the relays, in Sydney in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   An even better bet to get a world record here, and a big bonus,
might be decathlete Dan O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to be stoked,'' Pfaff said. ``For a decathlete there's
never been a chance to get this kind of prize money.''
</P>
<P>
   While heptathlete Jackie Joyner-Kersee is unlikely to set any
records, she figures to be in the spotlight in her last big
international competition.
</P>
<P>
   Pfaff, who used to coach Donovan Bailey, is also looking forward
to the 100 meters. ``There's been a lot of injuries and a lot of
woofing going on,'' he said. ``That's why I got out of it. But the
100 could be really exciting. So should the hurdles. The hurdlers
have been hot and they've been running in terrible European
weather.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the competition, the Goodwill Games also will
offer the United States a chance to rebound from the Atlanta
Olympics which, in addition to a tragedy, were marred by cheesy
commercialism and Third Worldesque transportation problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to a lot of people from other countries who were
turned off when we demolished the track stadium right after the
Olympics. Everybody mentions it,'' Pfaff said. ``This is a chance
to redeem our image.''

 &HT;    Board proposes more money for scholarships
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Saying too many Texans are being priced out of college,
state higher education officials are asking lawmakers to boost
spending for scholarships more than threefold _ to nearly $500
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at a real crisis of access by everyone _ not
just minorities, but the middle class,'' said Joe Krier of San
Antonio, a member of the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.
``If they (lawmakers) don't address this in a big, big way . . . we
believe they'll be looking at a dramatically declining number of
people in public higher education.''
</P>
<P>
   State lawmakers said they have hopes of substantially expanding
scholarships, which the state has not generously financed in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the board voted 15-2 against Texas A&AMP;M University's
request for a law school. A&AMP;M planned to offer law degrees in
partnership with a private institution in Houston, South Texas
College of Law, but the board was not persuaded the affiliation was
needed and would be cost-free to the state.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M President Ray Bowen said the proposal was ``one of the most
misunderstood academic initiatives'' his school had ever undertaken
and that A&AMP;M would pitch it again in several months.
</P>
<P>
   Although Texas colleges are considered a bargain, combined
annual tuition and fees have risen dramatically in the past five
years. At the University of Texas, those costs are up 78 percent
and will average $3,004 for undergraduates in the coming school
year, according to UT data.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Bill Ratliff, chairman of the powerful Finance
Committee, said there is a lot of interest in boosting aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are not many places, I think, where our money would be
better spent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Various aid proposals in the range of $500 million are floating
around the Capitol, including the Coordinating Board's
recommendation, which directs scholarships to the neediest Texans.
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff, a Republican from Mount Pleasant, said he would like
nothing more than to give all Texas students with a B average and a
family income below $100,000 a free ride to the college of their
choice, public or private. Georgia has something similar, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It would be difficult for the Legislature to cough up $500
million all at once, Ratliff said, but it's too early to say how
much might be available.
</P>
<P>
   The state expects to have a record $3.7 billion budget surplus
at the end of this biennium, and state Sen. Teel Bivins,
R-Amarillo, who heads the Education Committee, said all of state
government will be competing for the money. He favors the
Coordinating Board's focus on helping the neediest Texans first.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a huge first step,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bivins said the interim legislative committee on education and a
separate panel considering the effects of Hopwood, a federal court
ruling that led to a dismantling of affirmative action programs,
are discussing dramatically expanding scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard time and again the affirmative action that is
needed is an affirmative increase in scholarships,'' Bivins said.
``Obviously, it's race-neutral, but it would be a benefit to all
people, especially minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Data provided by the Coordinating Board show that 46 percent of
Texans live in households with annual income below $25,000. Of
black and Hispanic households, more than 62 percent fall below that
income.
</P>
<P>
   The Coordinating Board's proposal targets 267,354 of the
neediest students for scholarships that would be about $2,000 a
year for most students and less for others. The cost is estimated
at $498 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   The board's latest figures show that 135,946 students get
state-financed scholarships at a cost of $137.3 million, and that
doesn't come close to meeting the need, said Sharon Cobb, assistant
commissioner for student services.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government provides the bulk of the total $2 billion
annually in financial aid for Texas college students, Cobb said.
Most of that aid, however, comes in the form of loans, which must
be paid back, not in scholarships, which are free.

 &HT;    Clinton a persecuted minority
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ While sitting in on a televised panel discussion
on race, a big ol' white boy from Arkansas startled viewers around
the country when he solemnly announced that he was a minority. He's
part Cherokee, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Until that moment, everyone in America thought this man was just
a big, ol' white boy from Arkansas who happened to be president of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton's surprise announcement was designed to demonstrate
that he was sincere. He felt the pain of all minority Americans.
</P>
<P>
   You scoff. No, no, this time it was different. This time he
could really felt your pain because, by golly, this time he was
you.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was not merely sensitive to the feelings of those around
him, this time he actually assimilated their identities. ``We are
Willie Borg. You will be assimilated. Resistance is futile.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Clinton's statement that he is part American Indian is
true or not remains to be seen. But that's always the way it is
with Clinton. By now Las Vegas sports books must have several
betting lines posted on this subject. My guess is that the odds are
two-to-one that he made up his Indian heritage on the spot. After
all, this is a white man has a history of speaking with a forked
tongue.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably even money that Clinton will claim some new Native
American privilege when he is asked to produce proof that his
grandmother actually was a quarter Cherokee, as he claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno will have to decide whether she will
call for the appointment of another special prosecutor or run
interference again for another one of Clinton's invented claims of
privilege. Since she already holds world records in both of these
categories, this should be another even-money bet.
</P>
<P>
   I'd put my money on Reno calling for another independent counsel
to investigate Clinton's lying and covering up about his Indian
heritage. Think about it. If you recall, Reno seeks independent
counsels for everything Clinton does unless it involves laundering
campaign finance money or payoffs to the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   Vegas odds that FBI Director Louis Freeh will urge Reno to
appoint an independent counsel to investigate Clinton's Indian
heritage claim would be something like eight-to-one against.
</P>
<P>
   Reno is Freeh's boss, just as Clinton is Reno's boss. Freeh has
angered Reno by telling her that she is violating the Independent
Counsel Act by refusing to appoint an independent counsel to
investigate a campaign finance scandal that leads straight into the
White House. Freeh won't cross Reno twice.
</P>
<P>
   So far, independent counsel Kenneth Starr has not tied American
Indians to the Whitewater-Filegate-Travelgate-Monica Lewinsky
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But to be fair to Starr, which is not a popular thing to do, the
man only learned that he was dealing with the nation's first
American Indian president last week. This news was just as big a
surprise to Starr as it was to American Indians and all Americans,
which includes Cherokees and presumably Clinton's own family.
</P>
<P>
   On second thought, Reno did call for the appointment of an
independent counsel to investigate credible criminal charges in a
matter that involves American Indians and a possible link to
campaign donations. This investigation, however, targets Clinton's
Secretary of Interior Bruce Babbitt, one of several Clinton cabinet
officers under criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it shouldn't surprise anyone that Clinton would become
a persecuted minority right in the middle of a discussion of
persecuted minorities. Put Clinton next to Ellen DeGeneres and he
would announce that he is a lesbian trapped in a man's body.
Clinton is more than Borg, he's a shape-shifter.

   GLASS-COLUMN _ The digital revolution runs at warp speed.
Consider that when Bill Clinton arrived in the White House, hardly

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Former Tennessee quarterback Peyton Manning wants to
be the first NFL rookie to receive a $10 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Washington State quarterback Ryan Leaf, taken one spot behind
Manning in last April's draft, isn't as conservative. He reportedly
is asking for an $11 million bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals officials are watching both negotiations with great
anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contracts are going to be big,'' said one NFL executive
who has a top-10 first-round pick. ``You have the egos of two
big-time agents who have big-time quarterbacks who are going to
start from the outset. The teams can't afford to have the players
(hold) out.''
</P>
<P>
   Manning and Leaf were the first two players selected, right
ahead of former Florida State defensive end Andre Wadsworth, taken
third by the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL executive said Wadsworth will get a signing bonus of
about $8 million, which is nearly $2 million more than St. Louis
Rams offensive tackle Orlando Pace received as the first player
picked a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the quarterbacks get $10 (million), (Wadsworth) will get $8
(million),'' the NFL executive said, adding that Wadsworth's agent,
Eugene Parker, is going to ask for a deal that piggybacks the
quarterbacks' deals.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Eric Swann was paid the biggest signing bonus
in Cardinals history of $7.5 million when he re-signed last
February, a deal worth $25 million over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals Vice President Bob Ferguson, who is handling Wadsworth
negotiations, refused to comment on the possible contract terms.
</P>
<P>
   A league source said that Wadsworth and Charles Woodson, the
Michigan cornerback taken fourth overall by Oakland, are waiting to
see what deals Manning and Leaf get before signing. The source said
Woodson's deal will have little impact on Wadsworth's contract
because Woodson likely will sign long after Wadsworth.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Poston, Woodson's agent, has a history of lengthy holdouts.
</P>
<P>
   Both Manning and Leaf are expected to get six-year deals,
lengthy contracts that are more salary-cap friendly because a
signing bonus is spread out over the duration of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The six-year deals for each could be worth as much as $30
million. A year ago, cornerback Tom Knight, the Cardinals'
first-round pick, signed a five-year contract. Defensive end Simeon
Rice, also represented by Parker, signed a four-year deal as the
team's top choice in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Manning's agent, Tom Condon, and Leaf's agent, Leigh Steinberg,
are expected to ask for deals that include voidable years. The
contracts would void after two to four years.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals never have signed a contract that had voidable
years and don't want to give Wadsworth that kind of deal.
</P>
<P>
   A way around it could be to sign him to contract that includes
``buy-back'' years or ``escalators,'' a way of paying a player for
certain achievements, all of which are added to salaries in future
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals also have never signed any players to contracts
with ``buybacks'' or ``escalator'' clauses and prefer not to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have voidable years, buy-backs or massive escalators to
reflect the uncertainties of where contracts go,'' one agent said.
``In this market place, a rookie contract has no chance to be fair
after three years. You get the highest possible signing bonus
because you don't care what the contracts are (worth) at the end of
the deals.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, who don't have as much cash on hand as some
teams, often defer some of the signing bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   An agent said the team likely would want to pay (Wadsworth) in
three installments.
</P>
<P>
   Parker represents Wadsworth and the Cardinals' unsigned
second-round pick, defensive back Corey Chavous of Vanderbilt. It's
a tricky situation with the same agent representing both, getting
each contract under the remaining money available in the team's
$4.391 million rookie pool.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to Parker said the agent expects Chavous to sign
next week before training camp opens. Only one player in the top
five of the second round has signed. Chavous was taken third in the
round, No. 33 overall. &QL;

<P>
   PHOENIX - Think about living in the best of all worlds and
chances are your thoughts will finish second to what Diamondbacks
rookie Danny Klassen has already experienced.
</P>
<P>
   Klassen grew up in the adolescent equivalent of paradise and now
resides in Eden, which is his view of the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise that the 22-year-old shortstop/second baseman
is there. His is a case of destiny . . . and hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell he has had a real good upbringing,'' Diamondbacks
Manager Buck Showalter said. ``He has his feet on the ground and
understands what is important and what is frivolous.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understands the meat and potatoes of this thing and has a
pretty good feeling for the core of what playing pro baseball is
all about. It's a tribute to his mom and dad and the environment he
has been raised in.''
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Leamington, Ontario, to a hockey-playing father
who was also a devout fan of the Detroit Tigers, who played just 45
minutes from the family's doorstep. Vic Klassen moved his family to
Stuart, Fla., when his son was 2, but he never lost his love of the
Tigers or for baseball.
</P>
<P>
   His son never had to crawl under fences or clear a vacant lot to
find a suitable field for a pickup game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lived on about 10 acres of land, so when I was 9 years old,
my dad built me a regulation-sized Little League field (complete
with outfield fence) in my back yard,'' Klassen recalled. ``He
coached me all the way through Little League, and our team
practiced on the field two or three times a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also had a pond back there, so all of us would go fishing
after practices. When I turned 13, my dad expanded the field into
major league dimensions.''
</P>
<P>
   Complete with pond, of course. Might say it was the forerunner
of Bank One Ballpark's pool.
</P>
<P>
   He attended John Carroll High School, which featured the best
baseball program in the area. He lettered all four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always done things geared toward baseball,'' said
Klassen, whose parents were on hand Wednesday to witness his
clutch, two-out, two-strike hit in the 11th inning to beat Houston.
``My parents have been great in preparing me not only for baseball,
but also for life and how to act properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have liked to have played basketball or football and
those things, but my dad kind of discouraged it because he didn't
want me to get hurt playing football. Obviously, my best chance was
in baseball, and he could see it at an early age, so it was a
decision we made.''
</P>
<P>
   And one that worked. He's hitting .310 with three homers and
five RBIs in the eight games he's played with the Diamondbacks. He
had 10 homers and 47 RBIs during an injury-slowed 71 games in
Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   A high school All-American, Klassen signed with Florida State
but opted for the pro ranks and a healthy signing bonus when
Milwaukee drafted him in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   After four years in the lower minors, his batting average jumped
some 50 points to .331 under hitting coach John Pont last summer at
Double-A El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble was, his fielding percentage almost matched his batting
average. Klassen committed 50 errors at shortstop, his position of
choice until being switched at Tucson a month before being called
up.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee foolishly gambled that the high error count, coupled
with his absence from winter ball, would cause the two expansion
teams to overlook Klassen in November's draft. But after Showalter
made a personal inspection of the El Paso ballpark, he determined
the ``rock garden'' field produced many of the errors.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona took Klassen in the second round of the draft, to the
chagrin of Brewers management.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say it was a bad field. I never have,'' Klassen said.
``Buck said he didn't think it was in the best shape, but it was a
nice place to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fielding really frustrated me. I've always thought of
myself as a good fielder. I was kind of in a mental funk. My goal
this spring was to restablish myself as a good fielder.''
</P>
<P>
   Klassen has had three errors in eight games with the
Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The error barrage in El Paso helped him deal with what he thinks
is a major fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get frustrated very easily, and it's something I really have
to work on,'' Klassen said. ``I know I'm going to make mistakes.
Part of the growing process is learning not to carry your fielding
with you to the plate, or your bat into the field. You have to
separate them.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, Showalter hasn't sensed any frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``When young players come up they often get caught up in the
emotion of the moment,'' he said. ``Danny has had good, controlled
at-bats. I like the way he takes batting practice. There's no ego
involved. He's not up there to impress you.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll take a round or two to go the opposite way. He stays
behind and lets the ball go deep into the zone, which will give him
a chance to hit the breaking ball better. He's a humble kid. A lot
of guys let ego get involved in batting practice and try to make it
a home run derby. You can tell he's in there to get ready for a
game.'' &QL;

ASTROS PITCHER `LUCKY'  
 WAGNER OK, LEAVES HOSPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GINTONIO AND TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - A tired Billy Wagner left Phoenix ``in very good
spirts'' less than 18 hours after being struck on the side of the
head by a line drive during the Diamondbacks-Astros game Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner was released from Barrow Neurological Institute of St.
Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center on Thursday and flew back to
Houston to join his wife, Sarah, who is eight months pregnant with
the couple's first child.
</P>
<P>
   The relief pitcher suffered no long-term injuries after a ball
hit by Diamondbacks catcher Kelly Stinnett in the ninth inning went
off his head and ricocheted to the backstop.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner, who never lost consciousness and was carried off the
field, is expected to be sidelined for one to two weeks, according
to Dr. Curtis Dickman, Wagner's neurologist at Barrow. He said
Wagner suffered a soft tissue injury (bruise) to his scalp and left
ear. There was no brain injury and no skull fracture, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dickman said that Wagner lost just a small amount of blood
despite the force of the impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very lucky,'' Dickman said. ``He was in very good
spirits today before he left. He was sore and dizzy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect this issue to resolve completely in one to two
weeks. Mr. Wagner will make a full return to playing baseball once
he receives medical clearance from his physicians in Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickman said the dizziness was the result of a concussion to the
inner ear, which was caused by the impact of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner's wife, who watched the play on television, received a
number of calls from the wives of other players Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   It also was a traumatic night for pitcher Mike Magnante, a close
friend of Wagner's, who entered the game after Wagner was injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to put it out of your mind,'' Magnante said. ``I
thought about it a couple of times out there when I'm facing Matt
Williams and we're calling a sinker away. But the bottom line is
you've just got to believe it's not going to happen or else you
can't play in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pitcher's worst nightmare,'' Magnante said. ``You just
hope it never happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Stinnett said, ``It was an unfortunate thing. Hopefully, he's
doing well. You always talk about guys hitting the ball up the
middle. It's part of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros General Manager Gerry Hunsicker said the team wasn't
considering placing Wagner on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner is among the most popular of the Astros. The 5-foot-11
left-hander always sprints to the mound, jumping over the foul line
along the way. He throws hard, consistently in the upper 90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scary as hell,'' said Magnante, who was watching from the
bullpen. ``We were 350 feet away and we couldn't do anything except
for what everybody else was doing, which was watching and praying.
I got to talk to him right before they put him in the ambulance. He
just asked me to tell his wife that he was fine.'' &QL;

BOSS PRIZE FINALISTS: CONTEMPORARY WORKS INTENDED TO PROVOKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By GRACE GLUECK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Whatever else may be said about it, no one can
complain that the short list of artists eligible for the second
Hugo Boss Prize is not, er, multicultural. The six finalists
represent a wide geographical spread, from China and Korea to South
Africa to the United States, and a respectable ethnic mix.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the $50,000 award, given biennially by Hugo Boss
AG, a men's wear company based in Metzingen, Germany, and
administered by the Guggenheim Museum, will be named on July 29.
(The inaugural prize in 1996 went to an American, Matthew Barney.)
</P>
<P>
   The rainbow of candidates is apparently less about political
correctness than the far-flung, symbiotic interests of the two
parties involved in the selection. The Guggenheim has ''a global
approach to culture,'' said its director, Thomas Krens. And Hugo
Boss, which since 1995 has been sponsoring various exhibitions and
activities at the Guggenheim, has outlets worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The award is meant to honor an international artist whose works
''have made a decisive contribution to the advancement of
contemporary art'' and ''whose ideas both challenge and provoke
us,'' writes Joachim Vogt, chairman and chief executive of Hugo
Boss in the exhibition catalog.
</P>
<P>
   In the same publication, the show's organizer, Nancy Spector,
curator of contemporary art at the Guggenheim, says that the notion
of finding a ''best'' artist ''pales in importance to the
possibility of raising crucial public awareness'' about
contemporary artistic practices.
</P>
<P>
   Such a prize, whatever its role in raising public awareness,
also generates _ for very little money _ a buzz that benefits the
donor at least as much as the recipient. But in this time of
shrinking support from governments and corporations, a prize is a
prize is a prize, and no one should sneeze at a gift of fifty
grand.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors, drawn from an international roster of curators,
could nominate up to 10 artists. Works by the six finalists _
Douglas Gordon, Scotland; Huang Yong Ping, China; William
Kentridge, South Africa; Lee Bul, South Korea; Pipilotti Rist,
Switzerland, and Lorna Simpson, United States _ are on view in
''The Hugo Boss Prize, 1998'' at the Guggenheim Museum, SoHo.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that although the nominees have had a fair
amount of exposure, they are not yet hackneyed names on the
international art scene. Still, there isn't a lot going on here
that couldn't be seen in a good midseason week of New York art
trotting. The difference is maybe in scale: the vast Guggenheim
spaces tend to magnify effects.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the work is in film or video, with the exception of
contributions by Ms. Bul and Huang. Huang, whose use of live
animals and insects reflects their symbolic presence in Chinese
legends, presents an arresting environmental sculpture, ''The Saint
Learns from a Spider to Weave a Cobweb'' (1997). A giant web of
copper tubing that sprawls over the gallery's ceiling dangles a
dozen wire-mesh bags, each of which imprisons a live, alert
tarantula. An empty chair hangs from the web's center.
</P>
<P>
   The piece, we are told, refers to the teachings of a Taoist
alchemist, Ge Hong, who proclaimed the superiority of animals over
human beings. The empty chair that hangs from the web symbolizes
the presence of a saint who derives his creativity from observing
how nature works, i.e., the tarantulas. And they, quietly watching
for victims, represent a ``noncompeting strategy'' in the bustle of
the world. This intriguing work doesn't really encourage
contemplation _ suppose those nightmarish spiders got loose! _ but
there's strength in its calm silence.
</P>
<P>
   A more raucous event is Kentridge's ''Ubu Tells the Truth''
(1997), a mix of found film, stills and animation transferred to
videotape that makes the craven Ubu of Alfred Jarry's 1896 farce
into a symbol of apartheid. This Ubu is a racist killer whose
crimes are rendered by Kentridge in a surreal montage that melds
documentary scenes of South African atrocities with clever
animation. The film clobbers you with nutty segues from satire to
horror and back.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, ''Hysterical'' (1995), a film installation by
Gordon, seems campy and overblown. He uses a short segment from an
early medical film that demonstrates a masked woman being treated,
presumably for a psychiatric disorder, by two doctors. As they lay
restraining hands on her in bed, the action is projected onto two
giant free-standing screens: at normal speed on one, slowed down
and reversed on the other. The brief scene is continuously
repeated, resulting in a boring back and forth of jumpy images
inviting scrutiny for less than a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Simpson, known for her still photographs with evocative
texts about ambiguous relationships, has recently ventured into
film installation, and ''Recollection'' (1998) has its premiere
here. A black-and-white videotape, it depicts several women, Asian
and black, in one-sided telephone conversations that hint at
assignations and misunderstandings. Ms. Simpson's work transfers
well to film, intensifying the sense of ambiguity engendered by her
still photographs.
</P>
<P>
   You can almost walk into Ms. Rist's ''Sip My Ocean'' (1996), a
mammoth, dual-screen video environment projected into the angle of
two walls. Filmed mostly underwater, it's a lush paean to ocean
life _ coral gardens, dancing seaweed, crustaceans, romping fish _
into which the outside world intrudes in the form of floating cups,
dropped china, sensual glimpses of a woman's body. Over it all
floats the artist's voice singing a pop ballad about love. A sassy
piece of work, shot through with humor and a sense of sybaritic
merging with the sea.
</P>
<P>
   The show's most static exhibit is Ms. Bul's four white silicone
''Cyborg'' sculptures that hang from the ceiling, suggesting
robotic mutations of the female form, in which breasts are apt to
connect with legs and outer-space armor melds with body parts. The
cyborgs convey a futuristic view of women's gender strength, while
the out-of-sync bodies augur the menace of technology.
</P>
<P>
   And that, take it or leave it, is the Boss prize show. Who'll be
the winner seems, at this point, of less than momentous interest.

   TEHRAN, Iran _ Cupid might not have to sneak around Iran
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   This country's restless youth say they have noticed a relaxation
of the strict rules prohibiting unmarried women and men from being
together in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I watch my limits, it is my right,'' said 15-year-old
Pooneh, who did not want to use her last name.
</P>
<P>
   In February, she and a male friend were detained by the
``Beseej,'' the non-uniformed auxiliary police who cruise the city
streets in vans looking for trangressors of Islam's modesty code.
</P>
<P>
   Pooneh was lucky to be released after signing a statement that,
``I undertake not to be out with a boy -- whether a relative,
friend or boyfriend -- alone, or else my parents will be
informed.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, she reads in newspapers that walking in public will be
allowed as long as there is no hand-holding. Most believe the new
moderate president, Mohammed Khatami, has ushered in the change.
</P>
<P>
   Pooneh believes there has been a lighter touch since a girl
hanged herself while being detained. She was reportedly afraid her
parents were being told she was with a boy.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamic Republic's strict, morality-based laws have made
public courtship a risky endeavor over the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Married couples have had to be ready to prove they are married.
Youth were fined or detained in police stations. Parents were
called. Boys even complained of being beaten when detained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were always walking under a threat of being stopped,'' said
Vahid, 22, who was sitting recently in one of Tehran's many lush,
crowded parks with his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Her sister was detained for a night and fined after being caught
driving outside Tehran with a boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can go outside Tehran with a girlfriend,'' Vahid said.
</P>
<P>
   Banned from leaving town together, groups of girls and boys
drive in separate cars to rendezvous at parks, swimming spots and
ski lodges outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   Dark movie theaters provide cover for couples. They can slip
into each other's homes when parents are away.
</P>
<P>
   Fully more than half of Iran's 60 million people are under 20
years of age, and they expect more freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami's promises of a ``civil society'' helped him win an
election landslide with heavy backing from these same young
Iranians.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives may still control the police and courts, but
Khatami appeared recently to be admonishing the Beseej-type
intimidation -- or at least trying to keep young Iranians on his
side.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of the rhetoric in this country, it was all couched in
the name of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   ``For attracting the youth to Islam, they should be approached
with forgiveness and kindness,'' he said. ``Society cannot be
advanced with narrow-mindedness and creation of terror.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Iranians are keenly sensitive to the vagaries of Iranian
politics, where a cleric's speech can alter what couples face on
the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is easier now,'' said Alex Petrosian, 28. ``But, if (a
religious leader) says something about it at Friday prayers, it's
terrible for the next couple of weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   More parks and malls are free of the Beseej. Usually recruited
from Iran's poor neighborhoods, they can be spotted by their loose,
untucked shirts -- a nod to modesty standards against showing a
waistline.
</P>
<P>
   Iran remains a genuinely conservative society. Many parents
expect their children to come to them first when they seek to pair
up with someone.
</P>
<P>
   Razad Sadegi, a 25-year-old telecommunications engineer, said he
does not accept casual words like ``boyfriend and girlfriend.'' He
met his wife only a few times before they decided to get engaged.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``It's not good to try to put pressure and limits
on young people . . . Even if we put obstacles in front of them,
they will find their own way.''

<P>
   ``It sends a strong message that the only superpower left in the
world is concerned about trading with Africa.
</P>
<P>
   -Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., longtime civil rights proponent and
member of the Congressional Black Caucus
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first systematic attempt to incorporate trade and
investment in the overall policy toward Africa. We're not talking
about just a way to shoehorn U.S. businesses into Africa but a way
to address mutual concerns of both American businesses in Africa
and African businesses in America.''
</P>
<P>
   -Bill Jackson, The Africa-America Institute
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a global community where trade is the basis of most
capital. Until Africa becomes an active participant it will be hard
for it to attain self-sustaining development.''
</P>
<P>
   -Herschelle Challenor, Africa expert at Clark Atlanta University
</P>
<P>
   ``Years from now, I hope we can look back and be able to say
that we were there at a crucial juncture in Africa's growth and
development, that we played a constructive role in that change and
that we did the right thing at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   -Sen. Richard G. Lugar, R-Ind.
</P>
<P>
   OPPONENTS
</P>
<P>
   ``The eligibility conditions, when met, will cause a great deal
of hardship at ground levels in countries and further constitute a
broad side assault on the sovereignty of these countries. I think
it is a bad piece of legislation. Unless it is amended, it will do
incalculable damage and bring hardship to people across Africa. It
was obviously crafted in a one-sided way to serve the interests of
the American corporate sector.
</P>
<P>
   -Randall Robinson, President, TransAfrica
</P>
<P>
   If there is not a conscious effort, by law, to structure African
Americans into the Africa trade bill we have virtually no hope of
benefitting from increased world trade in general. I don't know the
exact language, but such language could be found if there was a
will to be inclusive.
</P>
<P>
   -Rep. Jesse L. Jackson, Jr. (D-Ill.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The opposition will increase as people understand more and
more what's at stake. When you start to read the fine print, you
realize it has different meanings and implications.''
</P>
<P>
   -William Lucy, American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees
</P>
<P>
   ``Our African colleagues oppose this bill because it grants
sweetheart deals for oil and other foreign corporations while
demanding African nations cut health, education and food programs
vital to their development.''

BOTTOM LINE ON DEATH ROW: A MUSHROOMING POPULATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL DOUGAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Convicted double-murderer Bill Bradford _ who
had decided to drop his federal appeal and accept an execution date
of Aug. 18 _ reportedly has changed his mind, according to an
anti-death-penalty activist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has decided to re-initiate his appeal,'' said Lance
Lindsey, director of Death Penalty Focus of California. ``It will
just be a matter of time before they vacate the execution date.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradford, 54, an amateur photographer, was convicted of luring
two Southern California women to their deaths under the pretext of
using them as models in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   His death sentence was upheld a year ago by the state Supreme
Court. An execution date of Aug. 18 recently was set by Los Angeles
Superior Court Judge Paul Boland after Bradford sent him a letter
that read, ``Please be advised that I am of sound mind and fully
agreeable with the selected date for execution of the death
judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bradford has changed his mind, it means a California
death-penalty milestone _ two executions in four weeks _ will not
be marked.
</P>
<P>
   The death by lethal injection of rapist-killer Tommy Thompson on
Tuesday was the first execution in more than two years. Only five
men have died in San Quentin's death chamber since capital
punishment was reimposed by the state in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   For death-penalty proponents, the sluggish pace of prosecutions
poses a problem: a backlog of death row inmates. More than 500
inmates are on death row in California, about the same number of
people who have been executed since the state's first death-penalty
statute was enacted in 1851.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they execute one person a week, it would take 10 years to
go through the current (death row) population,'' said Lindsey.
``Because we put 35 to 40 new inmates on death row each year, you
would still have the same number there at the end of 10 years and
you would have to go through the same process of weekly
executions.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey believes that kind of speedup would not be palatable to
the population, which supports the death penalty by a substantial
margin, ranging from 70 to 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some increase in the rate of executions is inevitable because of
Congress' 1996 Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act,
which limits the time for filing a federal habeas corpus appeal to
one year and makes it harder to file appeals based on new evidence
of innocence.
</P>
<P>
   But California is a long way from emulating Texas, where 37
people were executed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``What one could expect from California death cases in the
future is not that a trickle becomes a flood, but that a trickle
becomes a larger trickle,'' said Franklin Zimring, a professor at
UC-Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law. ``You would guess one or
two more executions this year, and probably similar magnitudes next
year.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, condemned inmates who began their federal appeals
process before the 1996 act was passed are not affected. They can
file an unlimited number of appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll still have this long backlog over a number of years of
those petitions that were on file beforehand,'' said Kent
Scheidegger of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, a
pro-death-penalty organization in Sacramento. ``The main effect of
(the '96 act) is coming. It isn't here yet.''

<P>
   HOUSTON _ A carnival-sized crowd in blue suits and neckties
abruptly pulled stakes at the end of the speech, and the carpeted
warehouse in which NASA keeps its biggest space training equipment
ebbed into a hush.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of the president can do that to a room, even one
this big and industrial: drain it of so many people so quickly it
feels like the air has left, too. Spectators, security officers,
television cameras with their clacking bird legs, all suddenly
gone. Out.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone split with President Clinton after his tour of
the Johnson Space Center on this hot April afternoon. The seven
bright crew members of the space shuttle Discovery still kicked
around on NASA's royal blue carpet, still buzzing a bit from the
VIP glow. With one exception.
</P>
<P>
   Payload specialist John Glenn, a native Ohioan, was not high on
the thrill of having been with the president, something he does now
and then in his day job. Instead he enjoyed a more precious moment:
hanging out with his space ship crew.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the glare, off camera, Glenn reveled in the
camaraderie of being John rather than Senator Glenn, dribbling out
M&AMP;Ms to all hands, swapping tastes of the space food that was
sampled by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Laughing in the glory of it. Biting a steaming fork of
rehydrated shrimp cocktail offered by a crew mate who declared it
``the Cadillac of space food.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, this is great!'' Glenn said, mouth open, chewing, hot.
``May have shrimp for breakfast, lunch and dinner, I don't know. I
found out one thing in tasting it: stir it up a little bit. If you
get down to the corner (of the plastic bag) where that horseradish
is concentrated, Ohhhhhh!''
</P>
<P>
   America is waiting for John Glenn's return to glory with the
shuttle launch in October, but Glenn himself is not. He turned 77
Saturday(NOTE: JULY 18), and for him the glory is already back.
</P>
<P>
   He is tenacious yet patient in the pursuit of his mission, and
those traits have served him well. That's why he broke the coast-to
coast flight record in 1957. Why, in 1962, he became the first
American in orbit. And that is why, come Oct. 29, he'll be the
oldest human to fly in space
</P>
<P>
   The launch is not for months, but the mission is already
underway. It's in the endless training on shuttle systems and the
poring over experiment manuals. It's him dangling down the side of
a life-sized shuttle trainer and mastering _ at long last since
he's been so slow warming to the new computers in his Senate office
_ the high-powered laptops that run some of the science experiments
aboard the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm enjoying every minute of it,'' Glenn said that day in
Houston, ``want to spend all the time here I can getting ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Believe that.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Lt. Col. Glenn rocketed through a clearing sky above
Cape Canaveral on that late February morning in 1962, he already
knew something about fame. Before the ticker tape parades and the
presidential medals and the speech before Congress, Glenn had
introduced his face to America.
</P>
<P>
   He teamed with youngster Eddie Hodges, who went on to a brief
Broadway career, to win about $25,000 on the television game show
Name that Tune in October of 1957. A former glee club member and a
life-long devotee to a good barbershop quartet, Glenn made big
money by quickly recognizing such tunes as Far Away Places.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some gal just walked up to him... `` remembers Glenn's
longest, closest friend, retired Marine Corps Lt. Gen. Tom Miller,
75. ``She didn't recognize him or anything, said, 'How'd you like
to be on a show?'''
</P>
<P>
   Recognize him? Yeah, Glenn was famous even before that. Months
before this CBS talent scout spotted him shopping in the New York,
Glenn made headlines by setting a cross-country speed record. The
mission was Operation Bullet, which Glenn invented and named, and
it involved flying the F8U jet at supersonic speeds from Los
Angeles to New York.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to wring out a supersonic engine over more than
three hours of high-powered flight time to see how it stood up. At
the same time, Glenn hoped to snag the spotlight for the Marines by
setting a record. Worked like a charm. The plane did beautifully
and Glenn, one of two pilots who took off that morning, was the
only one who didn't have to bail out before New York making the
trip faster than if he'd ridden a bullet fired from a .45 caliber
gun.
</P>
<P>
   When the Marines nominated Glenn for the Harmon Trophy, an
international aviator's prize that had previously been won by Chuck
Yeager and Howard Hughes, the Corps gave him all the credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be worth mentioning that it was largely through
repeated efforts on the part of the major that the Navy and the
Defense Department permitted the flight to be made,'' the Harmon
application reads. ``Three times (Glenn) had submitted detailed
proposals and flight statistics before, on the fourth try, his
efforts bore fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn didn't win the award, but he chiseled out a reputation for
rare tenacity. Anyone who saw him make the speed record his
personal mission knew Glenn would be a guy who didn't just beat the
odds, he'd wear them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always starts from behind and winds up in the front
ranks,'' said retired Adm. James Stockdale, who was in Glenn's
class at test pilot school. ``Covered everything in his life
because he'll take on a task without necessarily having all the law
degrees and all that stuff. He's willing to get in there and learn
it as he goes. And he's still doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stockdale became famous as Ross Perot's running mate in the
presidential election of 1992, but before his late-in-life
political debut he was a fighter pilot, Vietnam prisoner of war and
Congressional Medal of Honor winner. He tutored Glenn in physics
and calculus at the test pilot school in Patuxent River, Maryland
in early `54 because Glenn had left college before graduating to
fly in World War II. In exchange, Glenn taught the Naval Academy
grad to fly jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew within himself that he had the capacity to learn fast
enough to keep up with almost any academic experience,'' Stockdale
said.
</P>
<P>
   By launch day, Glenn will have spent nearly 500 hours in
training. He will know the essentials of living in orbit from
sleeping to using the bathroom (the toilet is vacuum sealed with
spring-loaded clamps that hold the astronaut in place). He'll
understand the rudiments of the shuttle life support systems and
radio operations, and he's been put in charge of the flight's still
and video photography.
</P>
<P>
   When he's done Glenn still won't be schooled in how to fly the
shuttle, but he'll be qualified for a job as a television news
cameraman.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Senator's down here we try to keep him busy because
we do have him for a limited period of time and we want him to be
as prepared with all the orbiter systems as we can,'' said Curt
Brown, Glenn's shuttle flight commander. ``Plus, he has a whole
suite of life science experiments that he has started.''
</P>
<P>
   He returns to Washington saddled with reading material.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only do we load him up,'' said Steve Williams, training
manager for Glenn's flight, ``but he loads himself up. He's a real
interesting man to work with. He wants more than is the minimum
required to perform the job. We give him the information that's
required to do the job, and he's looking for the next level of
detail, the next level of depth of knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Industriousness is not something Glenn developed for NASA. Or
the Marines for that matter. Growing up in New Concord, a pretty
Presbyterian town about 70 miles east of Columbus, Glenn got a car
only when he made a clunker on his dad's Chevy lot run. (Mr. Glenn
was a plumber by trade, but had a car dealership in tiny New
Concord.) And he only got money as a boy by harvesting rhubarbs
from the family garden and selling them from a wagon. ``I was the
rhubarb king of New Concord!'' he boasts.
</P>
<P>
   He also was a model airplane builder who loved the taste of
speed. That old Chevy was a convertible whose top had long ago
rotted away, and Glenn never replaced it. He drilled holes in the
floor to drain the rain, and has had rag tops ever since. Yes, even
today.
</P>
<P>
   But flying was something Glenn took to as soon as he could.
Muskingum College, right there in New Concord, offered flying
lessons for physics credit under a federal program designed to
build a supply of combat pilots as World War II approached. The
class was taught on a grass field 50 miles away, but that didn't
deter Glenn. No surprise there, he just drove.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Glenn insists the whole space shuttle thing began
accidentally. He swears he wasn't fishing for a way back into the
astronaut program, to get that second space shot he was denied
during Project Mercury. President Kennedy reportedly had decided
Glenn was too popular to risk his life with another rocket flight.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn was preparing for NASA's budget hearings in the summer of
1996 when he stumbled across a medical chart that listed the
multitude of physiological reactions the human body has to
prolonged weightlessness.
</P>
<P>
   He saw muscle atrophy and cardiovascular shifts, and
sleeplessness and weakening of the immune system. Brittling of the
bones. Dozens of changes to the body that astronauts endure in
weightlessness before recovering fully soon after returning to the
gentle pull of earth's gravity.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn had a thought. He snatched a medical book on geriatrics,
and there he saw another chart listing the many painful effects of
normal human aging. Muscle atrophy and cardiovascular shifts,
sleeplessness and weakening of the immune system. Brittling of the
bones.
</P>
<P>
   As a man in his 70s, Glenn was becoming familiar with some of
these conditions, though he has been stalling them as best he could
with a diet of perpetual moderation and a devotion to brisk 2-mile
walks four or five times a week.
</P>
<P>
   NASA already was working with the National Institute of Aging, a
part of the National Institutes of Health, on some of these same
issues but experts there hadn't yet proposed sending an elderly
person into space to see if an aged body would react any
differently than younger astronaut bodies do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got into this thing and developed what I thought was a
rationale for somebody (in his age group) going,'' Glenn said, ``to
look into these particular areas. And if I could do it, why,
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   But Glenn admits it wasn't really that casual for him. What he
saw in those medical books was more than some interesting facts
that made him curious. What Glenn saw in those medical books was a
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Within months he was on the floor of the Senate reading from
NASA documents about the similar effects of aging and space travel,
sharpening his rationale, taking it to the public through C-SPAN.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could have the very personal attention of every
person in this country who is 60 years of age or older,'' Glenn
said from the floor. ``One thing that has happened in the look into
the life and biosciences in the NASA program has been that we find
some notable parallels between what happens to astronauts in space
and what happens to the elderly right here on earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if we can find what triggers some of these similarities,
perhaps we will have a whole new handle on approaching difficulties
that people have right here on earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before that, he'd gone to see NASA Administrator Dan
Goldin, a President Bush appointee who found himself being asked to
approve sending into space a man born not many years after the
Wright Brothers triumphed at Kitty Hawk.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, the issue was more than age because this was not
just any fit-as-a-fiddle grandfather. John Glenn is a national
icon, a Cold War and Real War hero, the very personification of
America's pioneering work in space. Glenn didn't just ride
America's first space capsule into orbit, he designed the
instrument panel. It would be like bringing back Henry Ford to race
the Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   It was an opportunity of great poetry and great danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The space frontier is unforgiving to error,'' Goldin said.
``It was a very big decision that had to be made. You know, it was
not a comfortable decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody wants to be the guy whose decision to send America's John
Glenn back into space accidentally kills him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was uncomfortable in the sense, here is a national hero,''
Goldin said. ``President Kennedy made just the opposite decision. I
mean, the President of the United States decided not fly him
because he was a national hero. So it was uncomfortable in that
sense because I was going to override what President Kennedy had
decided some 30 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldin made a list of requirements that would have to be met
before he'd agree to the flight. The science experiments would have
to be legit, Glenn's health would have to be a certainty, the White
House would have to stay out of the process, and Glenn's wife Annie
would have to be consulted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know her and I called her,'' Goldin said of Glenn's wife
since 1943. ``You know what she said to me? `This is what John
wants to do. I've been with him for 55 years, I'm going to support
him.' ``
</P>
<P>
   And all the while, Glenn, as he is want to do, just kept coming.
</P>
<P>
   Need the experiments peer reviewed? Fine, tell me if I can
provide anything to help. Want me to pass a physical? Fine, you
pick the doctor. Need my medical history? No problem, I've been
sending NASA my annual physicals every year since I left the space
program in 1964. Between NASA and the Marines, the government has
most every one since I was in college.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin insisted on no medical waivers, ``and I said, `Fair
enough,'' Glenn said. He told his 52-year-old son David, a
physician in California, about all the medical tests he'd undergone
and the younger Glenn concluded that NASA had done everything but
an autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   But Glenn was not content to sit back and wait for the signal.
He started calling Goldin. To check. How's it going? What's cooking
on my idea for a shuttle flight? Have you heard anything new? Can I
get you any more information?
</P>
<P>
   About that time, Tom Miller got a call at home in Arlington.
This is the same Arlington house he lived in back in 1962, which is
next door to the house the Glenn's owned at the time -_ the Millers
and Glenns built the houses side by side _ the house where Annie
Glenn and the two teenaged Glenn kids watched America's first
orbital flight, and where Vice President Lyndon Johnson dropped by
that historic day.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Goldin was on the phone. He needed suggestions for dealing
with Glenn, Miller says. The senator was driving folks at NASA
crazy. But Miller didn't have much advice to offer on taming this
guy he'd known since flight school 50 years ago. It was more like a
warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Dan, `You're in contact with the most persistent person
I've ever known.'''

BROTHERS PRAISE JURY FOR PUNISHING ABUSIVE PRIEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYCHE HENDRICKS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Two California brothers on Friday praised a
jury's decision to order the Catholic church to pay them $30
million for failing to prevent a parish priest from molesting them
repeatedly over several years.
</P>
<P>
   James and Joh Howard, who were awarded $6 million in
compensatory damages and $24 million in punitive damages Thursday
in Stockton, Calif., claimed the Stockton diocese knew the Rev.
Oliver Francis O'Grady was a child molester and did nothing to stop
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're raised Catholic, you're raised to respect and revere
these people,'' James said. ``Issues of sexuality were taboo and
there was a lot of guilt and shame associated with that.''
</P>
<P>
   James, 23, who now lives in Berkeley, Calif., and works in San
Francisco as a structural engineer, said he was molested by O'Grady
from the time he was 5 years old until he was 12. He said he
learned only five years ago that Joh, 19, and his two older
brothers had also been abused by the priest, who was a close
advisor of their mother's, when he brought the matter up with his
siblings at his sister's wedding reception.
</P>
<P>
   A lawsuit brought by the two older brothers was thrown out, he
said, because the statute of limitations had expired.
</P>
<P>
   O'Grady was convicted in 1993 of molesting James and Joh Howard
between 1978 and 1991. He is serving a 14-year prison term.
</P>
<P>
   The civil trial that resulted in Thursday's verdict began in
early June. The case revolved around the question of whether or not
the diocese knew about O'Grady's sexual deviancy and, if they knew,
whether or not they were responsible for allowing him to be around
children.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Roger Mahony of Los Angeles, who was bishop of Stockton
from 1980 to 1985, denied in court that he knew O'Grady was a
molester at the time. But that testimony was contradicted by two
therapists who had treated O'Grady and said Mahony knew of his
condition, said Clohessy, who worked with the Howard family during
the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The current bishop of Stockton, Donald W. Montrose, issued a
statement Thursday afternoon asking the Howards' forgiveness ``for
this horrible evil that was inflicted on them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the diocese made a sincere effort to respond to the
matter. I regret we did not understand the depth of the problem,''
he said. ``Father O'Grady spent many years in therapy and during
this time, the diocese believed it was acting responsibly.''
</P>
<P>
   But David Clohessy, director of the Chicago-based group
Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, said the church
should have taken steps to remove O'Grady after he admitted in 1976
to molesting a 14-year-old Lodi girl, or after his therapist called
Child Protective Services in 1984 about another incident, prompting
a police investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Anderson, an attorney for the Howards, said the large
punitive damage award should impel the church to take allegations
of abuse more seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big-time message,'' he said, ``one that has to be
heard across the land in every diocese.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Montrose said the jury's decision will ``punish the
diocese in a way which will effectively destroy virtually all of
the services provided by the diocese to its people and the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the punitive damages of $24 million, Joh and
James Howard each were awarded $2.75million for past and future
mental and emotional pain and suffering, and $100,000 for damage to
future medical care and therapy. Joh Howard was given $450,000 for
future loss of wage-earning capacity, whereas James received
$200,000.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling came less than a week after the Catholic Diocese of
Dallas agreed to pay $23.4million to nine former altar boys in a
similar case.

PLANS CALLS FOR MORE TRAINING FOR NEW YORK TEACHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ New teachers will have to take 175 hours of
training every five years or risk losing their certificates under a
far-reaching plan by the New York state Board of Regents that aims
to improve teacher performance.
</P>
<P>
   The new requirement, effective Sept. 1, 2000, was part of a
package of reforms endorsed by the state in an effort to overhaul
the way teachers are certified, disciplined, trained and recruited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what occurred today is history for teaching in New
York and across the nation,'' said Regents Chancellor Carl T.
Hayden. Thursday's vote put an end to more than two years of debate
on the best way to update teacher standards. The regents have
already established higher graduation standards for students, more
rigorous tests and annual School Report Cards in an effort to
improve academic performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're placing everything we do in alignment today,'' Hayden
said. He said the reforms not only challenge teachers to do better
but the education programs that prepare them.
</P>
<P>
   The plan represents a compromise. Teachers faced mounting
pressure to overhaul tenure, with some critics calling for
mandatory periodic testing for teachers to remain certified. The
regents plan falls short of such a requirement, but requires
periodic training instead for new teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's plan requires all teacher education programs to be
accredited and essentially shut down programs in which fewer than
80 percent of their graduates pass the state certification exam.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, it would require school districts to evaluate
teachers on an annual basis and require all teachers who are rated
unsatisfactory to embark on a ``teacher improvement plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the plan was generally positive on Thursday, despite
concerns over who will pay for the 175 hours of training.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the chief concern of our membership,'' said Judy Warde,
assistance executive director of the state School Boards'
Association, ``that there won't be enough money to do the work
that's needed.''
</P>
<P>
   The regents plan anticipates state funding to cover the training
at an annual cost of up to $100 million by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Antonia Cortese, first vice president for New York State United
Teachers, said the union would lobby to secure that money, so
poorer districts aren't at a disadvantage. ``We'll be working to
make sure the state provides its share of the resources.''
</P>
<P>
   NYSUT, the state's largest teacher's union, came out in favor of
the 175-hour professional development program after the Regents
agreed not to make it mandatory for existing teachers. A
last-minute amendment to lower the requirement to 125 hours failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an important step forward,'' said Cortese. ``It says we
value teachers. It says what they know is important for what kids
need to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite losing the battle to require such training for all
teachers, several board members said they hoped current teachers
would take advantage of continuing education programs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, school districts will be required to have a
professional development program in place for all teachers by Sept.
1, 1999 or face state sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe teachers, if given the opportunity, will take
advantage of it,'' said Bill Hirschen, spokesman for the state
Education Department.
</P>
<P>
   Several school district officials said they support the
requirement for continuing education, despite uncertainly over how
such programs will be funded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's going to cause a great burden and it has a
lot of potential for improving what goes on in the classroom,''
said Schenectady School Superintendent Raymond Colucciello.
</P>
<P>
   Albany School Superintendent Lonnie Palmer also said the new
requirement will fit into what the district is already doing to
hone staff skills.
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights of plan include a requirement that all new
teachers complete their master's degree within two years of
starting their careers. The current standards gives teachers up to
five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good idea that there's a master's
requirement,'' said Palmer. But he said he was concerned about
teachers not getting enough hands-on experience. ``I think it's
crucial that those graduate education programs are immersed in real
teaching experiences.'' Other highlights of the plan include:
Requiring new teachers to pass three exams in liberal arts, their
content speciality and teaching skills before they can be
certified; Providing all new teachers with a year of state-funded
mentoring experience; Setting up a statewide ``Professional
Standards and Practices Boards,'' to maintain teacher standards and
accountability.

SAN ANTONIO MILITARY BASE HOUSING PLANS MOVE FORWARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CECILIA BALLI  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Government officials describe it as a quality of
life nightmare: Unable to provide adequate housing, the military
gradually is dissuading service men and women with families from
re-enlisting.
</P>
<P>
   But with a much-awaited turn toward privatizing base
construction and maintenance, local military leaders say they
finally have the financial muscle to replace deteriorating housing
units and reduce two-year waiting lists commonplace for enlisted
personnel with families.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 2-and-1/2 years have passed since Congress authorized the
Pentagon to contract with private builders and developers to
replace dilapidated military housing.
</P>
<P>
   Progress has been slow, but plans to construct 840 new family
housing units at Fort Sam Houston and Lackland AFB are inching
forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the Army is approaching business today is truly unique
in my experience,'' said Col. Bill Thresher, post commander at Fort
Sam Houston in San Antonio. ``There is certainly a sense of
entrepreneurial spirit that did not exist prior, which gives us the
facility to investigate very good buying decisions that affect the
military and the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Before privatization, military bases had to rely on relatively
small amounts of construction money doled out in yearly
congressional appropriations.
</P>
<P>
   However, those funds often are earmarked for the renovation or
one-for-one replacement of shabby military family homes not for
adding to existing base housing stock.
</P>
<P>
   With 61 percent of the nation's military population married
compared to 42 percent in the 1950s the housing crunch threatened
to become perpetual.
</P>
<P>
   Since the go-ahead to do business with developers, however,
there's hope Bexar County military bases finally will begin to add
housing units, cutting into waiting lists that can reach 30 months.
</P>
<P>
   Take Lackland, for example. With funds appropriated this fiscal
year, the Air Force plans to replace 50 units built in the 1950s
units plagued with water leaks, worn roofs, termite damage and
heating and cooling problems.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Lackland officials are negotiating with an
Austin firm to build a multimillion-dollar, 420-unit complex for
married enlistees by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Although some of those units will replace hundreds of homes
slated for demolition, the privatization project will also yield
148 surplus units.
</P>
<P>
   ``That typically doesn't happen in military construction, ''
said Debra Harkiewicz, chief of the base's privatization office.
``There isn't that kind of money at one time.''
</P>
<P>
   Fort Sam Houston is now one of five Army posts waiting for
approval to enter its own private construction venture.
</P>
<P>
   In six years, Thresher said, officials hope to replace 320
family units and construct an additional 100 nearly enough to
satisfy the post's need.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, roughly one-third of all military families live on
base. In the San Antonio area, only about 10 percent to 25 percent
of those stationed at Fort Sam Houston and at other air bases in
the area.

   Jay Leno: Nice guy.
</P>
<P>
   That's what everyone says about him. Popular wisdom says the
``Tonight Show'' host is one of the most decent celebrities around
_ a hardworking everyman who's never too busy to sign an autograph
or pose for a photo.
</P>
<P>
   I can think of at least three or four friends of mine who have
pictures of themselves with Jay. Arms tossed around each other, big
grins. These aren't people who work in the media and would have
special access to Leno _ they're fans who have met him in the Billy
Goat or at Mr. Beef or somewhere in LA.
</P>
<P>
   They all had the same thing to say about their encounter. It was
pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   You never hear about Leno brushing off a fan in some diner or
being rude to a waitress. He's more likely to don an apron and
pitch in behind the counter for a half hour, all the while posing
for snapshots and cracking jokes and reminding everyone what time
every night he's on NBC-TV.
</P>
<P>
   Yet I've long thought there's also something disturbing about
the guy. Any grown man who would hide in a closet to eavesdrop on a
conversation between network executives, as Leno did when he was up
for the job as Johnny Carson's replacement, has a bit of a dark and
sneaky side, wouldn't you say?
</P>
<P>
   There's also a dichotomy between the ever-grinning Leno who
comes out before a show's taping in denim work shirt and blue
jeans, working the crowd, and the often mean-spirited monologuist.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment lore says Leno trumped David Letterman in the
ratings in July, 1995, with the infamous ``What the hell were you
thinking!'' interview of then-scandalized Hugh Grant. While that
show did give Leno a ratings boost, he actually started gaining
steadily on Letterman earlier that year _ when he peppered each
night's monologue with joke after joke about the O.J. Simpson
trial. Who can forget the Dancing Itos?
</P>
<P>
   Letterman, the supposedly mean one, refused to do O.J. jokes for
months, despite pleadings from his staff. ``I just don't think
double murder is funny,'' said Dave.
</P>
<P>
   Leno had no such moral qualms; he mined the trial for every
nugget of humor he could find, never worrying about stepping into
tasteless territory. By the time Letterman gave up his stance and
started cracking wise on O.J., it was too late. The ratings war was
over.
</P>
<P>
   And even though Letterman was the one who held off for so long
on the O.J. jokes, all the headlines about Leno said, ``Nice Guys
Finish First.''
</P>
<P>
   You want further proof Jay's a good guy? Consider how he reacted
last week when he was criticized for a joke he made after attending
Harley-Davidson's 95th Anniversary Reunion in Milwaukee. Leno said
that while he feels fat in Los Angeles, all those big bikers in
Brat-town made him feel thin by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   That's it. He called some bikers fat. You know what? Some of 'em
are.
</P>
<P>
   But Leno reportedly received reams of mail from Milwaukeeans who
were steamed about the remark, including some nasty threats. He was
also criticized in the Milwaukee media.
</P>
<P>
   Weird. It seems as if half the jokes Leno made on his most
recent visit to Chicago were about our love of pizza and beef and
other thick foods, and I can't recall a single complaint. Guess
they're touchier in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Super-nice Jay's reaction to the criticism? Major mea culpas. He
telephoned Milwaukee Journal Sentinel columnist Joyce
Evans-Campbell to apologize, telling her, ``I didn't mean anything
by it. It was a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Leno called a thin biker who was featured in
Evans-Campbell's column, to apologize to him. How nice can you get?
</P>
<P>
   Well. I guess it depends on whose looks you're mocking. Even as
the biker controversy was brewing, Leno had this to say about the
sex scandal in Washington: ``Linda Tripp testified last week. For a
minute, I thought they were rerunning the movie `Tootsie.'''
</P>
<P>
   And: ``Linda Tripp has her own Web site on the Internet. There's
one Web site you pray they don't have nude pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny. Cheap. Easy.
</P>
<P>
   So in other words, it's all right to mock the physical
appearance of a stout woman, even if that woman is the mother of
two children, but you should apologize if you make fun of
big-bodied bikers.
</P>
<P>
   Interesting how the mind of a nice guy works sometimes.

<P>
   A confusing and rambling, but revealing, interview granted last
week to The New York Times by Cuban exile and self-styled terrorist
Luis Posadas Carriles has helped uncover a convoluted and painful
issue in U.S.-Latin American relations.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban's confessions of planting bombs in Havana hotels last
year, and killing an Italian tourist, but also of carrying out
assassination attempts on Fidel Castro's life in the early 1960s,
raises an issue that has been lingering on the U.S.-Latin American
agenda for several years.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a central point, nor one that will be addressed
promptly or easily. But it should be faced, as the century comes to
a close and a full decade passes since the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 40 years, the two superpowers waged a surrogate
war around the globe. The former Soviet Union paid its dues bylosing the Cold War _ its penitence lies in the humiliating defeat
that brought its existence to an end. The United States bore much
of its burden domestically _ part of the Cold War's cost was paid
for by the internal dissension and distress wrought by Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   But although the damage provoked by the superpowers in Latin
America was nowhere near what occurred elsewhere in the Third
World, neither the Soviet Union nor the United States have really
come to terms with this dark history, nor made amends for what
happened. The USSR is no longer around to revisit the past; the
United States is.
</P>
<P>
   Posadas' confessions regarding his participation in terrorist
bombings as recently as last year, as well as his claims that these
and other terrorist acts were directly financed by Jorge Mas Canosa
and the Cuban-American National Foundation, bring the problem to
the fore.
</P>
<P>
   The Foundation, a powerful anti-Castro lobbying group, has been
welcome at the White House for nearly two decades. It also has
tax-exempt status and has received federal support for many of its
projects. It denies involvement, but is now accused by its most
ardent supporters, not simply by Castro's intelligence agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA and FBI have also dimissed any connection ``for years''
with Posadas, but given their track record on such matters, the
denials are less than credible. The real question is whether it is
time for the Clinton administration, on its own, to open an
independent investigation of U.S. behavior in Latin America during
the Cold War, and whether that behavior was compatible with
perennial American laws and values, and not merely the political
imperatives of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   It is time for the United States to sit in judgement of its own
history in Latin America, as other nations have done, for example,
in regard to World War II. The point is not for others to judge the
United States _ this has already been done, and for better or for
worse, most informed Latin Americans have their views on the
subject. Washington should delve into its own archives, testimony,
confessions and recollections to determine what was right and what
was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   If it turns out, as many suspect, that at least part of what was
done ran flagrantly counter to American principles, then apologies
are in order. Although what occurred was partially explainable by
the Cold War logic of the time, if U.S. laws and norms were
violated, it should be so stated and Washington should ask to be
forgiven by those who became the victims of its illicit acts.
</P>
<P>
   The process already has begun in these better-known cases:
</P>
<P>
   _ the CIA-sponsored coup in Guatemala in 1954 that ushered in a
45-year period of violence, repression and instability which is
only now beginning to subside, and which has included instances of
CIA involvement in highly questionable acts as recently as five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   _ the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961, the official
investigation and report of which was just recently issued by the
CIA. A force sponsored, financed and trained by the United States
invaded a sovereign nation whose government was recognized as
legitimate by the world community.
</P>
<P>
   _ the full-fledged invasion of the Dominican Republic in April
1965, where the presumed threat of instability and ``communism''
warranted, to the Lyndon B. Johnson administration, an open
occupation of the island.
</P>
<P>
   _ the various CIA-organized dirty tricks against Salvador
Allende of Chile, between October 1970 and September 1973, which
though partially investigated by the congressional Church Committee
in 1975, were always tempered by the arguable thesis that the
Chilean people wanted to overthrow Allende.
</P>
<P>
   _ the financing, training and sponsoring of the contras in
Nicaragua during the 1980s, where the United States openly sought
to overthrow a government with which it had diplomatic relations.
Yet this administration was fully recognized by the local and
international community, and had committed no hostile act against
the United States other than strident rhetoric and unfriendly
votes.
</P>
<P>
   _ the Christmas invasion of Panama in 1989, where Washington
unleashed the bloodiest, most costly and disproportionate drug-bust
ever against Manuel Noriega, someone who probably deserved to spend
years in jail, but not at the cost of hundreds of lives, and
millions of dollars in damage.
</P>
<P>
   All of these instances can be judged from two perspectives: the
Cold War rationale of the time, and the more lasting criteria of
American and universal values of morality, respect for the rule of
law and international coexistence.
</P>
<P>
   One can understand the logic of the moment, but it cannot be an
eternal standard. If that were the case, aberrations such as
slavery, segregation, colonialism and torture would all be
perpetually justified. At the time they occurred, they were either
legal, accepted or tolerated. Yet today, with other values and
other views, they are all deemed immoral, reprehensible and wrong.
Governments, states and leaders are increasingly responding to
demands for a revision of their past, for a more balanced judgement
of their history, and for apologies when they are due.
</P>
<P>
   Events transpired cannot be relived, and there are undoubtedly
more pressing problems to address at present, but the uncertainties
of the future can perhaps best be faced by getting on with this
wrenching but necessary settling of scores from the past.

<P>
   Not so long ago, in the mid-1980s, Raisa Gorbachev, in her crisp
pastel business suits, became an internationally known figure as
the Kremlin's first visible first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at age sixtysomething, she is still a voice to be heard,
particularly in support of women and children, struggling to
advance, or merely to survive, in the morass of post-communist
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Mellowed and fully recovered from the ordeal of being held
captive under house arrest by hard-line communist rebels, during
the 1991 coup plot against her husband, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the
last president of the former Soviet Union, she remains his constant
world traveling companion, as well as a high-profile commentator on
the Russian scene.
</P>
<P>
   Born in southern Siberia, of a Russian mother and Ukrainian
father, the eldest of three children, she arrived in Moscow at age
17 and graduated from the Philosophical Faculty at Moscow
University in 1954. That's where she met Gorbachev at a dance and,
meanwhile, earned the equivalent of a Ph.D. in the budding science
of sociology.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, her case studies and surveys of the peasants of
Stavropol did much to reveal the normal details of family life
under communism. ``Sociology is basically a science of feedback,''
she says, ``of listening to people, but in a totalitarian society
that constitutes a threat because the opinion of the state was
supposed to be the opinion of all.''
</P>
<P>
   Her doctoral dissertation was about the fact that, despite lip
service to equality, women were less represented in politics than
men, and made less money, and even though many women had higher
education there were very few with Ph.D.s. So that despite the
ideology, in fact, ``the actual situation turned out to be not so
bright.''
</P>
<P>
   Today she believes the declining status of women in Russia is a
reflection of the country's overall social, economic and political
turmoil. Women still bear the brunt of running the household and
feeding the children, and often, because wages are so low, they
also work two or three jobs. Meanwhile, single motherhood is on the
rise; so are rates of divorce, domestic abuse and the numbers of
women who become victims of prostitution rings run by international
crime syndicates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have freedom of speech,'' she reflects, ``that came
with perestroika. But a lot of that is now no more than a facade
because currently people can say whatever they want, but no one
pays any attention. That's not democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   In our recent interview over coffee at Boston's Copley Plaza
Hotel _ speaking through the Gorbachev's longtime translator Pavel
Palazchenko _ she recalled the pros and cons of being a
``liberated'' first lady.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CAROLEE MORRISON: As a Russian first lady on the world stage,
you were quite a revolutionary _ was that a strategy of some sort?
</P>
<P>
   RAISA GORBACHEV: The fact is that we really didn't have first
ladies, in the traditional sense of that term. In many civilized
countries _ say, the United States or Germany or France _ there are
laws or traditions or rules that set out the responsibilities and
rights of the wife of the head of state.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, we did not have that. There were czarinas, there were
empresses. Lenin's wife surely had her own personality, but then
came Stalin, and after Stalin, we very simply did not have any role
for the wife of the head of state. No one knew them, they were
invisible and basically nonexistent for the society.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev broke with that tradition, and I was not just a first
lady. My problem was that I was the first first lady in our
country. And the problem was not so much my individual traits or
personal characteristics, but the fact that we had to create a new
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you didn't take it personally, if there was criticism that
you were ``too much out in front''?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. For example, in our country no one was concerned when
Nancy Reagan or Hillary Clinton or wives of Turkish prime ministers
came to Russia on a state visit. Everyone said OK. But so far as I
was concerned, given the patriarchal tradition of our culture, it
caused a very mixed attitude that I was a visible first lady.
</P>
<P>
   But quite a few people too were very proud of me, and are still
proud of me and say, ``We regard you as a person who enhanced the
dignity of the Russian woman.'' But there are those who grumbled
and resented it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I wonder about a comparison of you and Hillary Clinton _ two
intelligent, educated women who had careers, and opinions, and were
criticized for not, in effect, altering your personalities to meet
public expectations after becoming first ladies. Do you feel
anything in common with her?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've been told very often that I resemble Hillary Clinton;
I've been told that in Europe. However I am older, I was before her
and I was the first first lady _ so maybe she resembles me. That's
maybe just a joke, a humorous aside, but so far as Hillary Clinton
goes, I have a lot of respect for her.
</P>
<P>
   I like that she has a lot of energy. I respect women who have
had a professional career. It seems to me that she is very
intelligent. I also like women who are dedicated. And some of the
things she has had to go through recently, I think, indicate that
she has a lot of pride and dignity. She is going through what is
happening with a lot of dignity and professionalism _ this is an
element of character one has to appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the circumstances have decided that I was not
able to get together with her. There are, maybe, working against
that, political, maybe some other things.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about other American first ladies you've known? I
believe that Barbara Bush wrote in her memoir that you were ``a
pretty package,'' or some such.
</P>
<P>
   A: (laughs) I like Barbara Bush, in a very different way. I had
an easy time with her. I mostly have an easy time with people who
are open, communicative. Barbara Bush is a very natural person, a
very outgoing person. She is as she is. And so what you see is what
you get. ``Heart on her sleeve,'' I heard that phrase. And I
believe she is that kind of an American woman. In a way, I think,
that's a similarity between the American and Russian people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Mrs. Yeltsin, I believe, met quite openly with Mrs. Clinton
in November when she toured Russia and the republics and visited
the capital of the Urals, in Yekaterinburg.
</P>
<P>
   A: I think what we see here is that the tradition of the role of
the first lady has now been established. President Yeltsin is
always accompanied by his wife. In the past, wives of Soviet
officials never accompanied them on trips. She is with him, also
working in some charitable activities, opening exhibits, greeting
other first ladies.
</P>
<P>
   No one is concerned, no one pays it any attention. She is there,
it's OK. The wife of former Prime Minister Chernomyrdin also was
traveling with him and our people were no longer upset about it. So
I broke with the old tradition and created a new one.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you feel more support for your work in Russia today?
</P>
<P>
   A: I get many letters from people _ they also approach me
personally to become more active, to work in some kind of movement
for civil empowerment, or for more civic awareness to help enhance
the role and status of women in society.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think Russia will ever have a woman president?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not in the near future. A lot in our country would have to
change. It would be many years before a woman could be president.
Whether it is 10 years or more no one can tell, but I think it will
be more than 10 years. It would take a change toward a civil
society. Russia doesn't have a civil society yet. I would say that
only in countries where democracy is truly established, where a
civil society is truly established, can a woman become president or
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Q: People have commented on the large influence you had, and
have, over your husband. How do you construe this?
</P>
<P>
   A: When people speak about my influence on Mikhail Sergeyevich,
well, there is influence on matters of everyday life, matters that
involve his respect for me, and he is a very respectful person _ so
he respects me as his wife. Of course I would say that we were tied
together by love, but that's a different kind of influence.
</P>
<P>
   I've had my professional career, I read a great deal. Mikhail
Sergeyevich and I always discuss many, many things, and certainly I
develop my own opinions, and sometimes he agrees or he disagrees. I
think we very well express our views to each other.
</P>
<P>
   But I never, ever had any political role, and Gorbachev never
appointed me or any one of his relatives or family members to any
political position _ never, never. Not as adviser or assistant or
aide. Boris Yeltsin has made his daughter a political adviser, and
other family members hold political positions. Gorbachev never did
that.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not just that he listened to me either. As head of
state Mikhail Sergeyevich had, and still has, many intelligent
people and associates who brief him on the facts, people who still
work with him. He may listen to me, but the decision is always made
by Gorbachev himself, and then he speaks out and expresses his
stand.
</P>
<P>
   I have never spoken out against a decision he made. It was
always his decision, his leadership, and that decision was law for
us.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you define your own work and role today?
</P>
<P>
   A: To me it's a little difficult to define my role. I think it's
for the others to say, and for my husband to say, what they see as
my role.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And your work?
</P>
<P>
   A: I would perhaps talk about Raisa Gorbachev's Club, a civic
group that has been active for almost a year. It was created by me
and a number of wonderful women: authors, journalists, some members
of the State Duma and women who are social scientists. We aren't an
elite club for socializing and not a political club either. We are
a discussion forum to debate the urgent issues.
</P>
<P>
   We are focussing now on an important problem that has not been
properly addressed by government, so we are looking for support
from other people to try to address it: the plight of Russia's
homeless children, 2 million of them, wandering the streets of
Moscow and St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   There are disabled children, children who are victims of crime,
retarded and mentally disturbed children. So many are
disadvantaged, but we are focusing on children with no families,
homeless children, children who've been virtually thrown out on the
street, who live in basements, who sleep in gutters and in sewage.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And your goal is, what, to raise funds?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, and we have selected three main projects: a clinic for
50 children run by Dr. Mikhail Kornyushin, the chief physician at
Moscow's Morozov Children's Hospital; a home for runaway children
called the Road to Home orphanage; and a bus, run by Dr. Vassili
Sereda of the Foundation for a Healthy Generation, which serves
children in four urban areas of St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   The bus goes out three times a week, in rain or cold or hot
weather, and the doctor has what is called a feeding operation. The
bus comes, the kids appear, and if they see there are no policemen
around, dozens of them come. They don't want to be picked up
because many ran away from alcoholic parents; some ran away from
orphanages where they were abused and things were very bad.
</P>
<P>
   So he feeds them; he also treats their wounds, provides
medication, psychological counseling, even clothing. And if someone
is in need of hospitalization, he also does that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was it hard for you to make a transition to private life, to
your work, after President Gorbachev stepped down? Or did this
happen very naturally as the time passed?
</P>
<P>
   A: I am someone who always worked. I had a professional career
for 25 years. When Mikhail Sergeyevich stepped down as president,
our life went into a new phase. During the attempted coup, in the
Crimea, they were preparing to either isolate us or to kill us. And
they were not able to do that because Gorbachev had wide-ranging
international recognition, because the world was very alarmed.
</P>
<P>
   After the coup collapsed, nobody expected that we would remain
active. For the first time in the history of Russia, a head of
state could not be confined or executed, or anything like that.
This is another Gorbachev revolution. And he is continuing to work.
He provides for the family. He provides also funding for The
Gorbachev Foundation. He also created the International Green
Cross.
</P>
<P>
   He is speaking out on many things. And I would say that today
the political elite is still persecuting Gorbachev, and creating a
kind of information blackout against Gorbachev, and mistreating
him.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you ever consider leaving Russia to lead a more
comfortable life in the West?
</P>
<P>
   A: Any number of suggestions were made to us about moving to the
West, to some other countries, to live pleasantly.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But you stayed.
</P>
<P>
   A: It is Gorbachev's destiny to remain in Russia; it is his
choice, his position on principle. He always says that he never
doubted the correctness of his decision, his choice of reform. If
he had not opted for reform, he would probably be general secretary
of the Communist Party, and things in Russia would have remained
basically the same as before Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
   However, I'm sure that without Gorbachev starting reform in
Russia, nothing would have changed, things would have remained the
same for years. He believes the reforms were good for Russia, so he
says he will stay in Russia until the end, unless of course he is
compelled to leave. And one can imagine some kind of events that
would transpire that he would be expelled from the country.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Your marriage is somewhat unusual _ you've been together a
long time.
</P>
<P>
   A: Since each of us was 18 years old ... and today I think we
live one life only. Why should it be different? Why should I oppose
today what his life is? I believe I am helping him now as I was
then and whatever I can do, to the extent that my health permits, I
will still be helping him.

<P>
   Not so long ago, in the mid-1980s, Raisa Gorbachev, in her crisp
pastel business suits, became an internationally known figure as
the Kremlin's first visible first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at age sixtysomething, she is still a voice to be heard,
particularly in support of women and children, struggling to
advance, or merely to survive, in the morass of post-communist
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Mellowed and fully recovered from the ordeal of being held
captive under house arrest by hard-line communist rebels, during
the 1991 coup plot against her husband, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the
last president of the former Soviet Union, she remains his constant
world traveling companion, as well as a high-profile commentator on
the Russian scene.
</P>
<P>
   Born in southern Siberia, of a Russian mother and Ukrainian
father, the eldest of three children, she arrived in Moscow at age
17 and graduated from the Philosophical Faculty at Moscow
University in 1954. That's where she met Gorbachev at a dance and,
meanwhile, earned the equivalent of a Ph.D. in the budding science
of sociology.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, her case studies and surveys of the peasants of
Stavropol did much to reveal the normal details of family life
under communism. ``Sociology is basically a science of feedback,''
she says, ``of listening to people, but in a totalitarian society
that constitutes a threat because the opinion of the state was
supposed to be the opinion of all.''
</P>
<P>
   Her doctoral dissertation was about the fact that, despite lip
service to equality, women were less represented in politics than
men, and made less money, and even though many women had higher
education there were very few with Ph.D.s. So that despite the
ideology, in fact, ``the actual situation turned out to be not so
bright.''
</P>
<P>
   Today she believes the declining status of women in Russia is a
reflection of the country's overall social, economic and political
turmoil. Women still bear the brunt of running the household and
feeding the children, and often, because wages are so low, they
also work two or three jobs. Meanwhile, single motherhood is on the
rise; so are rates of divorce, domestic abuse and the numbers of
women who become victims of prostitution rings run by international
crime syndicates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have freedom of speech,'' she reflects, ``that came
with perestroika. But a lot of that is now no more than a facade
because currently people can say whatever they want, but no one
pays any attention. That's not democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   In our recent interview over coffee at Boston's Copley Plaza
Hotel _ speaking through the Gorbachev's longtime translator Pavel
Palazchenko _ she recalled the pros and cons of being a
``liberated'' first lady.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CAROLEE MORRISON: As a Russian first lady on the world stage,
you were quite a revolutionary _ was that a strategy of some sort?
</P>
<P>
   RAISA GORBACHEV: The fact is that we really didn't have first
ladies, in the traditional sense of that term. In many civilized
countries _ say, the United States or Germany or France _ there are
laws or traditions or rules that set out the responsibilities and
rights of the wife of the head of state.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, we did not have that. There were czarinas, there were
empresses. Lenin's wife surely had her own personality, but then
came Stalin, and after Stalin, we very simply did not have any role
for the wife of the head of state. No one knew them, they were
invisible and basically nonexistent for the society.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev broke with that tradition, and I was not just a first
lady. My problem was that I was the first first lady in our
country. And the problem was not so much my individual traits or
personal characteristics, but the fact that we had to create a new
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you didn't take it personally, if there was criticism that
you were ``too much out in front''?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. For example, in our country no one was concerned when
Nancy Reagan or Hillary Clinton or wives of Turkish prime ministers
came to Russia on a state visit. Everyone said OK. But so far as I
was concerned, given the patriarchal tradition of our culture, it
caused a very mixed attitude that I was a visible first lady.
</P>
<P>
   But quite a few people too were very proud of me, and are still
proud of me and say, ``We regard you as a person who enhanced the
dignity of the Russian woman.'' But there are those who grumbled
and resented it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I wonder about a comparison of you and Hillary Clinton _ two
intelligent, educated women who had careers, and opinions, and were
criticized for not, in effect, altering your personalities to meet
public expectations after becoming first ladies. Do you feel
anything in common with her?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've been told very often that I resemble Hillary Clinton;
I've been told that in Europe. However I am older, I was before her
and I was the first first lady _ so maybe she resembles me. That's
maybe just a joke, a humorous aside, but so far as Hillary Clinton
goes, I have a lot of respect for her.
</P>
<P>
   I like that she has a lot of energy. I respect women who have
had a professional career. It seems to me that she is very
intelligent. I also like women who are dedicated. And some of the
things she has had to go through recently, I think, indicate that
she has a lot of pride and dignity. She is going through what is
happening with a lot of dignity and professionalism _ this is an
element of character one has to appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the circumstances have decided that I was not
able to get together with her. There are, maybe, working against
that, political, maybe some other things.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about other American first ladies you've known? I
believe that Barbara Bush wrote in her memoir that you were ``a
pretty package,'' or some such.
</P>
<P>
   A: (laughs) I like Barbara Bush, in a very different way. I had
an easy time with her. I mostly have an easy time with people who
are open, communicative. Barbara Bush is a very natural person, a
very outgoing person. She is as she is. And so what you see is what
you get. ``Heart on her sleeve,'' I heard that phrase. And I
believe she is that kind of an American woman. In a way, I think,
that's a similarity between the American and Russian people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Mrs. Yeltsin, I believe, met quite openly with Mrs. Clinton
in November when she toured Russia and the republics and visited
the capital of the Urals, in Yekaterinburg.
</P>
<P>
   A: I think what we see here is that the tradition of the role of
the first lady has now been established. President Yeltsin is
always accompanied by his wife. In the past, wives of Soviet
officials never accompanied them on trips. She is with him, also
working in some charitable activities, opening exhibits, greeting
other first ladies.
</P>
<P>
   No one is concerned, no one pays it any attention. She is there,
it's OK. The wife of former Prime Minister Chernomyrdin also was
traveling with him and our people were no longer upset about it. So
I broke with the old tradition and created a new one.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you feel more support for your work in Russia today?
</P>
<P>
   A: I get many letters from people _ they also approach me
personally to become more active, to work in some kind of movement
for civil empowerment, or for more civic awareness to help enhance
the role and status of women in society.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think Russia will ever have a woman president?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not in the near future. A lot in our country would have to
change. It would be many years before a woman could be president.
Whether it is 10 years or more no one can tell, but I think it will
be more than 10 years. It would take a change toward a civil
society. Russia doesn't have a civil society yet. I would say that
only in countries where democracy is truly established, where a
civil society is truly established, can a woman become president or
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Q: People have commented on the large influence you had, and
have, over your husband. How do you construe this?
</P>
<P>
   A: When people speak about my influence on Mikhail Sergeyevich,
well, there is influence on matters of everyday life, matters that
involve his respect for me, and he is a very respectful person _ so
he respects me as his wife. Of course I would say that we were tied
together by love, but that's a different kind of influence.
</P>
<P>
   I've had my professional career, I read a great deal. Mikhail
Sergeyevich and I always discuss many, many things, and certainly I
develop my own opinions, and sometimes he agrees or he disagrees. I
think we very well express our views to each other.
</P>
<P>
   But I never, ever had any political role, and Gorbachev never
appointed me or any one of his relatives or family members to any
political position _ never, never. Not as adviser or assistant or
aide. Boris Yeltsin has made his daughter a political adviser, and
other family members hold political positions. Gorbachev never did
that.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not just that he listened to me either. As head of
state Mikhail Sergeyevich had, and still has, many intelligent
people and associates who brief him on the facts, people who still
work with him. He may listen to me, but the decision is always made
by Gorbachev himself, and then he speaks out and expresses his
stand.
</P>
<P>
   I have never spoken out against a decision he made. It was
always his decision, his leadership, and that decision was law for
us.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you define your own work and role today?
</P>
<P>
   A: To me it's a little difficult to define my role. I think it's
for the others to say, and for my husband to say, what they see as
my role.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And your work?
</P>
<P>
   A: I would perhaps talk about Raisa Gorbachev's Club, a civic
group that has been active for almost a year. It was created by me
and a number of wonderful women: authors, journalists, some members
of the State Duma and women who are social scientists. We aren't an
elite club for socializing and not a political club either. We are
a discussion forum to debate the urgent issues.
</P>
<P>
   We are focussing now on an important problem that has not been
properly addressed by government, so we are looking for support
from other people to try to address it: the plight of Russia's
homeless children, 2 million of them, wandering the streets of
Moscow and St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   There are disabled children, children who are victims of crime,
retarded and mentally disturbed children. So many are
disadvantaged, but we are focusing on children with no families,
homeless children, children who've been virtually thrown out on the
street, who live in basements, who sleep in gutters and in sewage.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And your goal is, what, to raise funds?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, and we have selected three main projects: a clinic for
50 children run by Dr. Mikhail Kornyushin, the chief physician at
Moscow's Morozov Children's Hospital; a home for runaway children
called the Road to Home orphanage; and a bus, run by Dr. Vassili
Sereda of the Foundation for a Healthy Generation, which serves
children in four urban areas of St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   The bus goes out three times a week, in rain or cold or hot
weather, and the doctor has what is called a feeding operation. The
bus comes, the kids appear, and if they see there are no policemen
around, dozens of them come. They don't want to be picked up
because many ran away from alcoholic parents; some ran away from
orphanages where they were abused and things were very bad.
</P>
<P>
   So he feeds them; he also treats their wounds, provides
medication, psychological counseling, even clothing. And if someone
is in need of hospitalization, he also does that.

GREYHOUND STILL STUCK IN ALASKA

 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ ``Rapido Sable'' may have a slow race back home.
</P>
<P>
   Sable, a 3-year-old retired racing greyhound, is caught in the
middle of a custody battle between her temporary owner in
Fairbanks, Alaska, and Greyhound Pets of America's San Antonio
chapter.
</P>
<P>
   Elsy Bless, president of the Helotes-based non-profit
organization, had raised money for Sable's return to San Antonio
after a military family that adopted her moved to Fairbanks and
abandoned her at a dog pound there.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Cook, who works at the Fairbanks pound and was taking care
of Sable pending her return here, does not want to send her back,
Bless said.
</P>
<P>
   So Bless did what anyone does in a custody fight: she has
consulted a lawyer and is preparing to sue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going with this until the bitter end,'' Bless said.
</P>
<P>
   Cook declined to comment on Bless' allegations or say whether
she planned to keep the dog.
</P>
<P>
   She appeared at a Fairbanks television program that aired on
Monday, announcing the dog was up for adoption, Dawn Dearden, a
reporter for KTZF-TV in Fairbanks, said.
</P>
<P>
   Cook, a dog handler at the Fairbanks Animal Control Facility,
has kept the dog at her home for more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``She turned her back on me,'' Bless said. ``Everything was all
right until Wednesday, when my lawyer told me that Tina did not
want to return Sable.''
</P>
<P>
   Adopted in February in San Antonio, Sable was left at a dog
pound June 30 in Fairbanks by her owners, Charles and Kathy
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Bless requested, and got, a reprieve from the pound to keep
Sable from being euthanized.
</P>
<P>
   Cook offered to take the dog home July 2 to give Bless time to
find another owner or to raise enough money to bring the dog back
to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bless said she last talked to Cook on Saturday evening, and she
seemed cooperative about a planned return of the dog Sunday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tina even volunteered to take the dog to the Anchorage
airport,'' Bless, who said she had planned to pay Cook's expenses
for keeping the dog, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thank Tina for keeping Sable, but it makes me angry she is
trying to put the dog up for adoption without my authorization,''
Bless said.
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Gardner, an attorney who volunteered to work with Bless
free of charge to get Sable back, said the organization plans to
file a lawsuit next week against Cook and the Williams couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are thinking of filing a sort of claim,'' said Gardner, who
has talked with Cook four times and had kept in touch with her
until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Sable saga, meanwhile, has generated a lot of attention and
donations, although Bless would not say how much money the
organization raised to pay for the dog's trip home.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was willing to return the donation of anyone who is
satisfied the dog is out of danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate all the support from thousands of people from all
over the United States,'' Bless said.
</P>
<P>
   She is also offering a reward to know Sable's whereabouts. Bless
can be reached at 695-8441.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a hostage in San Antonio, and I feel Sable is,
too, in Fairbanks,'' she said. -30- I

   Not many things make John Glenn squirm. Nerves of steel are part
of the legend, part of the hero package. After all, he's a fighter
pilot who flew 149 combat missions In World War II and Korea and
collected a host of medals in the process. This after losing a

   Glenn has met with world leaders, and even made a hearty but

   WASHINGTON _ Last September, the League of Women Voters in
Athens, Ga., staged an issues forum on children's health. Ten
people showed up.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, the league sponsored an event on how to steer
non-college students to technical school. Fifteen people came. In
November, a reception to meet local candidates for office fared a
bit better, drawing a few dozen participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then we served food after work,'' laments Morene Williams,
president of the league in Athens, home of the University of
Georgia. ``It seems if there is no big conflict, people aren't
interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Local community leaders such as Williams are seeing first-hand
what is crossing the radar screens of pollsters, civics experts and
university professors around the country with alarming consistency:
in the great public square of American democracy, the voting
citizenry has gone home.
</P>
<P>
   Average voter turnout in primary elections is down 14 percent
from 1996, falling to the lowest level ever in the 16 states that
have held two-party primaries this year.
</P>
<P>
   The trend suggests, many experts believe, that turnout in
November's general election will be lower than 1996. In that year,
voter participation in a general election fell below 50 percent for
the first time since 1924.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have moved away from any sense of civic duty, civic
responsibility and civic engagement,'' said Curtis Gans, director
of the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate, who
recently completed a study on voting trends. ``We now have an
electorate of the interested and the zealous, and both of those
pose a serious threat to our democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The downward trend, visible at the ballot box for the past 40
years, extends to other aspects of civic life as well. Fewer people
report that they are paying attention to candidates and what they
are talking about. Fewer say they are closely watching the
activities of government, and confidence in government has dropped
nearly 40 points since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people joining local community groups and civic
organizations has been inching down for 20 years, according to data
compiled by the National Commission on Civic Renewal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in danger of becoming a nation of spectators,'' says
the commission's co-chairman, former Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The forces propelling voter retreat from the public square are
numerous. Critics of the money-driven campaign system, which
requires candidates to raise and spend vast sums, say voters
believe that money, not voting, influences their elected
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign reform advocates believe that American campaigning in
the 1990s, with its emphasis on attack advertising, packaged
campaign slogans and candidates who shun direct contact with
voters, is to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember the public being so disconnected from
Washington and so removed from political life,'' says Fred
Wertheimer, president of the advocacy group Democracy 21. ``There
is extraordinary political game-playing in Washington, there is
deep, deep partisanship, and it confirms to citizens that too many
politicians are too interested in playing games instead of
attending to their needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Still others look at the trends more broadly, noting that
two-parent, working families have less time to become involved.
America has also a become a highly mobile society.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a while to get established in a community, so you
don't feel any sense of civic responsibility,'' says Doug Bachtel,
a noted sociologist at the University of Georgia who studies
demographics. ``We just can't blame it on disenfranchisement. There
are a lot of economic and demographic trends driving this.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, pollsters and analysts are discovering a unique paradox
among American voters. Voters are both satisfied with the status
quo and deeply cynical about politics and government.
</P>
<P>
   With unemployment and inflation at record lows, many Americans
seem content to ignore Washington and the Congress, especially when
most of what they read or hear about is a fairly consistent diet of
scandal and partisan sniping.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mood seems to be keep the rascals in rather than throw the
rascals out,'' said William Galston, former director of the civic
renewal commission. ``People are feeling as negative about the
political system as they are feeling positive about the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Galston, a political scientist at the University of Maryland,
adds another reason for the decline in voter participation: the
breakdown of political parties at the grass-roots level. ``We have
dismantled the institutions that tended to connect the average
citizens with political leaders,'' he says. ``If the mediating
institutions aren't there, voters are going to be increasingly
detached.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the backdrop of voter disenchantment, several groups are
trying voluntary reforms in states around the country to improve
the tone and substance of political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance for Better Campaigns, based in Washington, is
working in 10 states to encourage local television stations to
stage regular candidate debates, and exact pledges from those
candidates that they will appear in all their advertisements _ a
way to lessen the chance of negative campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   The Project on Campaign Conduct, led by the Institute for Global
Ethics in Maine, is sponsoring pilot projects in Ohio and
Washington this year to have candidates agree to abide by a set of
campaign ethics, such as avoiding personal attacks.
</P>
<P>
   A poll conducted by the project and released last week found
that more than nine in 10 voters believe that candidates will
engage in negative personal attacks and will mislead voters about
their records. Just less than half said they believe that most or
all candidates lie to voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This question of the negativity of our process and the
demeaning civil discourse that we find ourselves stuck with is
pushing people away,'' said Rushworth Kidder, director of the
Institute for Global Ethics. ``We have got to find a level of
discourse that is based on values and not simply on interests if we
are going to work together.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Kidder preaches the notion that politics without the common
values of responsibility, respect, fairness, honesty and compassion
can't survive.
</P>
<P>
   While analysts and observers disagree about the root causes of
voter dissatisfaction, there is widespread agreement that the
results are potentially dangerous to the well-being of a nation
that claims to be the world's greatest democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The more average voters retreat, the more politics is controlled
by special interests. Already in Congress this summer, the
legislative calendar is filling up with measures designed to appeal
to special interests. Republicans have staged several votes on
abortion, such as making it a crime to transport a minor to another
state to avoid parental notification laws, in order to energize
religious conservatives in the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, meanwhile, are pushing for an increase to the minimum
wage, an issue that resonates strongly among traditional Democratic
voters such as labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more people stay away from participation at the polls, the
more those (special) interests dominate,'' says Nunn. ``Good
government by its very nature comes from our citizens. And if you
don't have informed, participating citizens, there is no way you
are going to have good government except by pure luck. And that
won't last long.''

AS UNIONS WARM TO HIM, HARSHBARGER'S CAMPAIGN HEATS UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Scott Harshbarger was up on Jake Kennedy's rubbing
table yesterday, four months to the day from when the attorney
general discovered his Achilles heel. Err, tendon.
</P>
<P>
   He missed the St. Patrick's Day Parade in Holyoke because he was
flat on his back, headed for a wheelchair-cast-crutches-limping
pattern from a freak basketball injury as he ran innocently
downcourt.
</P>
<P>
   But his campaign is not limping anymore. The
Harshbarger-for-guv'nah effort is off the runway and flying, at the
moment. And thanks in large measure to a steady surge of support
from union leaders, Harshbarger is now the heavy favorite to win
the Democratic nomination that six months ago some disregarded as
worthless.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Governor Paul Cellucci's lackluster summer and the
virtual disappearance of any positive campaign effort from
Cellucci's surrogates, or from running mate Jane Swift, whose
pregnancy has insulated her from the rough-and-tumble of partisan
politicking, left a void.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's Republican opponent, state Treasurer Joe Malone, has
not managed to engage Cellucci to the extent he'd like (and
Cellucci would very definitely dislike). But Harshbarger had a
better spring and early summer than any of the folks running for
governor, managing to overcome at least some of the institutional
(Beacon Hill and Mayor Tom Menino's office) reluctance to embrace
the earnest Harshbarger effort.
</P>
<P>
   Former state Senator Pat McGovern, a distant No. 2 in the
Democratic race polls, managed to raise less than $70,000 in the
latest reporting month made public, and Brian Donnelly, the former
congressman, is way in the rear. Harshbarger said yesterday he was
$1.3 million in his war chest as of yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative satraps and Boston mayors have never had much
influence on the gubernatorial selection process, and that is
holding true this year. And labor union chiefs have a decidely
mixed record at the gubernatorial level, choosing to exercise their
clout far more emphatically in federal elections.
</P>
<P>
   But the state AFL-CIO seems to have arrived at a point where the
leadership believes it is possible to dislodge the GOP incumbent,
after eight years of hostile decisions from the corner office.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger is enjoying unexpectedly warm relations with labor
leaders who took a while to thaw. But yesterday the AG nailed down
endorsements from three powerhouse unions _ Locals 103 of the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, 7 of the
Ironworkers, and 285 and 509 of the Service Employees International
Union, the private and public sector branches, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger's assiduous courting of labor with programs and
policy stands intended to please union members paid off. When Joe
Faherty and Bobby Haynes of the state AFL-CIO took a hard look at
the field, they were impressed with Harshbarger's dogged field
work, and a financial operation that is the only bigtime
fund-raising effort on the Democratic side.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger says his AFL-CIO endorsement ``has been crucial'' to
the momentum he's built up. And he pins his hopes next on an avid
courtship of the various teachers' unions that have been under
assault on Beacon Hill from a variety of sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole agenda we've put together for working people
appealed to the AFL-CIO, and they've got 400,000 people organized.
We are taking on this guy (Cellucci) on education, health care, and
working family issues, and it shows. The others (McGovern,
Donnelly) are perfectly good people, but we've shown the union
people that ours is the campaign that can win.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to various published polls showing him pulling into a
near-tie with Cellucci in some surveys, Harshbarger said, ``The
polls are now showing it, but the labor people came in ahead of the
polling.''
</P>
<P>
   Union legwork was crucial for Ted Kennedy and John Kerry in
their Senate victories, and Cellucci's reputation with labor is not
generally good.
</P>
<P>
   Even Harshbarger's critics _ and there are many establishment
Democrats who are cool to his personality and his prosecutorial
penchant for targeting prominent Democrats over the years _ concede
he is a dogged and determined campaigner, a workaholic at the
process.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger thinks he has put together the best grass-roots
organization of this cycle. ``We're a million dollars ahead of Pat
and Brian combined, and Cellucci has been helping a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger says the incumbent's stuttering performance of late,
sitting on his big GOP polling lead vs. Malone, helps spread the
sense that ``he can be beaten.''
</P>
<P>
   As he submitted to yet another rehab routine at the injury
clinic, Harshbarger dwelt on how he'll spend the next 110 days:
``There's 61 days to the primary, then 47 to the final _ and it's
beginning to come together now. I think the coalition is moving
very nicely.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother was a teacher, and you get the feeling that teachers
and parents of public school kids may be target No. 1 for the
Harshbarger ad campaign this fall.

A STONE AGE FIND IN MAINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ernest Pouliot moved into his Eliot, Maine, home in 1992. Now he
knows how popular that choice of landscape has been _ for thousands
of years.
</P>
<P>
   In advance work for the state's ambitious natural-gas pipeline,
archeologists excavating Pouliot's property have found stone tools
dating to the dawn of human habitation in New England.
</P>
<P>
   That was 12,000 years ago, or shortly after the scarred terrain
of present-day New England appeared in the retreating tracks of a
mile-thick ice sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Archeologists say that the artifacts uncovered this month on
Pouliot's land are among the oldest ever found in New England. And
their undisturbed condition makes a find of such rare antiquity
even more valuable, the researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably the most significant site any of us will work
on,'' said Theresa Kintz, an archeologist who helped excavate the
site with a dozen others from mid-May until last week.
</P>
<P>
   But Kintz complained that pipe construction deadlines -- the
Canada to Massachusetts pipeline is going through Pouliot's
property -- may have applied pressure on the archeologists to
excavate the site quickly.
</P>
<P>
   John Flumerfelt, spokesman for the Portland Natural Gas
Transmission System, said he ``wouldn't deny that we made it clear
we'd like it done as quickly as possible.'' However, he said,
project officials have always been prepared to halt one of the
largest infrastructure projects in state history for proper
excavation of any important historic site.
</P>
<P>
   Principal archeologist Douglas Kellogg and Maine state
archeologist Art Spiess deny that their work in Eliot was
compromised in any way. ``We had plenty of time to do what we
needed to do,'' Kellogg said.
</P>
<P>
   Kintz herself says that the work probably was as good as could
be expected under the circumstances. But she adds that in 11 years
of field work she has never seen as quick a transition from
discovery to excavation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen us roll right over from identification of a
site to full-scale data recovery in two weeks,'' Kintz said. ``I
think we could have done a better job given more time.''
</P>
<P>
   Doing the best excavation possible, or rerouting construction
projects where feasible, is particularly important at such sites
because of their rarity, Kintz said. Only about two dozen such
finds have been recorded in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Spiess said that the discovery is another piece in the puzzle of
the lives of the region's earliest pioneers. And what Kellogg's
company, John Milner Associates of West Chester, Pa., finds in its
study of the tools may provide more evidence of how these
inhabitants _ the ``Paleoindians'' _ ate, camped and lived.
</P>
<P>
   Among the artifacts uncovered in Eliot were scrapers fashioned
of red flint from Munsungun Lake, 250 miles away in northern Maine.
Those stone tools may have been used to separate hides from
animals, butcher caribou for food, or fashion clothing or packs.
</P>
<P>
   Also recovered was a stone drill and a burned bone, a
potentially precious clue about what kind of game was hunted. In
those days, wooly mammoths and mastodons may have shared the
tundra-like landscape of northern New England with the descendants
of nomads who first crossed the land bridge from Siberia to North
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is evidence that real people lived here for thousands of
years in the Stone Age,'' Kintz said. ``Their lives were just as
fulfilling and complicated as ours.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eliot site fits the pattern of other Paleoindian camps
discovered in New England, archeologists said. On the southern face
of a hill, protected from the north wind, the site probably
provided good views of moving herds along the Piscataqua River
floodplain, Kintz said.
</P>
<P>
   Paleoindian hunters _ probably moving in groups of about five
families or 30 people _ routinely roamed 200-mile areas of the
region in search of food. The discovery that all of their stone
came from Munsungun Lake indicates that these prehistoric Americans
had established routes through modern Maine to obtain the tools
that were essential to their survival.
</P>
<P>
   The Eliot excavation site was filled Wednesday. Now, only the
archeologists' notes remain for future researchers who wish to
recreate the area, Kintz said. Although the ancient camp is known
to extend beyond the pipeline path, Kintz said, the opportunity to
study the site as a integrated whole has been lost.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Pipeline officials and other archeologists acknowledge that
more time or preservation of the site is always preferable to
pre-construction excavation. But in this case, Flumerfelt said, the
site never would have been uncovered if not for the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a tradeoff when you find a site at the last
minute in a construction project,'' said James Bradley, director of
the Peabody Museum of Archeology, which is planning a Paleoindian
exhibit at its facility at Phillips Andover Academy in Andover,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, the work that has been done will help illuminate
the lives of the earliest Americans, although its significance has
yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   But, for Kintz, the site's importance is difficult to quantify.
To her, it's an incredibly rare connection with people who exist
only in legend and the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are first Americans, the first pioneers, the people who
settled North America,'' she said. ``They walked so much more
gently upon the earth.''

BOARDS MAY NOT BE PRESSURE-TREATED 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. The pressure-treated floor boards of my deck are 11 years old
and are rotten. Can I turn them over to expose undecayed wood? But
how in the world can I pull them off? The nails seem very tight,
and I'm afraid I might pull their heads off.
</P>
<P>
   JOHN ELWOOD, Bourne, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Pressure-treated boards are not supposed to rot, and, in
fact, do not, if they are properly pressure-treated. I suggest the
boards are not pressure-treated. Besides, if the boards are rotting
at the top and/or sides, turning them over will do no good.
</P>
<P>
   So, tear them off and install properly pressure-treated boards
(a full inch thick). Pressure-treated boards are identified by a
blue, yellow, or red plastic label stapled to one end.
</P>
<P>
   But tearing them off might still be difficult. First, chedck to
see if the fasteners are screws. If so, use a reversible drill to
back them out. If they are nails, use an extra long pinch bar (30
or more inches long rather than the standard 24 inches. Chip out
decayed wood around the nail head so you can get the hook of the
bar under a nail head. Then pry steadily. The extra length will
give you more prying power. You could put a block of wood under the
fulcrum (where the curved part of the hook rests on the floor) to
give even more pulling power.
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't work, tear off the floor boards, leaving the
nails exposed; if you can't pull them, cut them off with a hacksaw.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My house sits on ledge, so the yard often presents problems,
with stone formations quite close to the surface of the property.
One of those problems is a small bowl in the ledge; it fills with
water and leaves, and I am always stepping in it. How can I fill it
to prevent that hazardous situation, which is hard on the ego as
well as the ankles.
</P>
<P>
   VICTORIA, from Abington, mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It should not be a problem. Set a whiskey half-barrel over
the depression and fill it with impatiens or other colorful
annuals. Be sure to drill holes in the barrel bottom for drainage.
Save the shavings; they have a faint scent of whiskey. You could
use any kind of a container, and you could set it over a wood
table, too, if you like.
</P>
<P>
   Or, fill depression with concrete. Stick a flag in it to locate
it. But a container full of annuals is more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. How does one stop squeaks in a floor under carpeting, without
pulling up the carpet?
</P>
<P>
   H.M.M., Moline, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. This is an old question, answered a million times, but since
H.M.M. left no return address in his/her note, the handyman is
obliged to answer in the column. He hopes H.M.M. sees it. The
squeaks occurred when the floor boards (both the top floor boards
and the subfloor boards, or plywood) dried out and shrank. With
this shrinkage, the nails lost their grip, and the two floors move
when walked on; the squeak is the sound of the wood scraping
against the nails. The cure is to make sure the floorboards do not
move. Sometimes in summer, the squeaks go away because the wood has
taken on moisture and expanded.
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways to fix the squeaks. If the floor is the main
floor of the house, and the underside of the floor is open in the
basement, drive shims (tapered shingles make good shims) between
the floor boards (or plywood) and joists (the beams holding up the
floor). This will bring the floors tightly against the joists and
each other, preventing movement.
</P>
<P>
   If the floor boards are not accessible from below, try this: The
Improvements Catalog sells what it calls Squeeeeek (yes, misspelled
with no fewer than five e's) No More, a kit containing an alignment
and depth-control tool and 50 three-inch screws. Set up the
alignment tool in the right spot (preferably over a joist) and
drive the screw with a power driver to the right depth, then break
off the screw, which is scored to allow easy breaking under the
floor surface. Fluff up the carpet and you're done. It's best to
drive the screws into a joist; if you can't find the joist, second
best is to drive through both floors. This system will work on
floors without carpeting, too; the holes left by the broken-off
screws are easy to fill with wood filler.

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's a report from Barry Ehrlich of Mount Vernon, Vt., who
called recently to inquire about re-siding his barn, which he
planned to do with ship-lapped wood boards. The handyman suggested
using white cedar shingles instead, without treatment because no
treatment is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlich responded, ``I put up white cedar shingles as you
suggested, and it is just great. I don't have to do anything to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Short, sweet, and appreciated, especially on a subject the
handyman feels so passionately about.

<P>
   Q. I collect rain water from my roof. Can I use it for plants?
</P>
<P>
   ANTHONY GIRNIUS, Roslindale, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You betcha. It's a great way to handle the water bans that
are so common this summer, as in most summers. How about high acid
content, if the water is from acid rain? Not a problem, since your
plants are already thriving on regular rain, acid or not.

 KIBBUTZ GEZER, Israel: ... on its economy.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The statistics are a lot of hype. The fact is Israel is not
doing as well as it should be,'' Thurow said on a tour of the
country this month. ``Israel is not a miracle. There is no country
in the world with education levels as high as Israel that has such
a low per capita income.''
</P>
<P>
   Thurow compares Israel to Singapore. In 1965, Israel had 10
times the per capita income of Singapore. Today, Singapore has two
times the per capita income of Israel, even though Israel remains a
far more educated country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why? Well, as Israel has found out, if you take all your
talent and put it in the military, you hurt your economy. If you
don't have peace and stable trading partners, you hurt your
economy,'' Thurow explains.
</P>
<P>
   Israel today is like New England in the late 1960s, Thurow adds.
Back then there were dying industrial towns in Lowell and Lawrence
and there was a new road called Route 128 with new companies. But
they were very small. Today, New England seems to have successfuly,
albeit painfully, made the transition from an industrial to a high
tech economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that doesn't mean Israel will inevitably end up like New
England, unless it manages its future well,'' Thurow warns. ``The
dying industries can overwhelm the growing industries.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the pain of the transition of the economy is evident in
Israel as unemployment continues to climb, edging toward 9 percent
this month. The dropoff in jobs is a result of a transformation
from the lower-value-addded manufacturing sector, where hundreds of
thousands were once employed, to super-high-margin software
businesses that employ fewer, but more educated and skilled,
people. Mirabilis is a prime example. Despite its tremendous
success and the wealth it has created for its owners, the company
employs only 65 people.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's policy of maintaining an
overvalued shekel has been clearly tilted in favor of the high tech
businesses. This has kept inflation down to about 7 percent and
helped venture capitalists, but it sacrifices jobs in the
manufacturing companies that seek to export goods overseas because
it makes the goods more expensive. The bulk of the workers in
manufacturing are the working class Sephardim, or Jewish immigrants
mainly from Arab countries, who have supported Netanyahu's Likud
government. These economic policies could eventually spell
political danger for Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are creating a deep class division here. And it will
create a lot of unrest,'' says Nat Shenker, the president of Oletex
Industries Ltd., a textile company in Jerusalem that employs 300
people and has been suffering in the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu feels a high tech economy may be insulated from the
constant tensions in the region.
</P>
<P>
   In a June 11 interview with Fortune magazine, Netanyahu said:
``The amazingly growing sector in Israel is the high-tech sector.
And that is the most impervious to political or military
developments... Peace would be a useful condition, but it is not
the primordial, necessary condition, which is anywhere, economic
freedom _ and we are increasing that kind of freedom by leaps and
bounds.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are many business leaders and economic analysts who
think Netanyahu is dangerously misguided, and that the economic
fate of Israel and the region will depend on the peace process,
which for the last 16 months has been derailed. Specifically,
analysts point to declining foreign investment in Israel as a sign
that the investors' optimism that surrounded the peace process is
fading. Overseas investment in the first five months of 1998 was
$806 million, down dramatically from $1.5 billion in the same
period last year, according to Israel's central bank.
</P>
<P>
   Even President Ezer Weizman, whose role is largely ceremonial
and rarely confrontational, has taken Netanyahu on by boycotting an
annual economic conference last month. He blames Israel's economic
stagnation and what he sees as the economy's failure to live up to
its potential on Netanyahu's unwillingness to break the impasse in
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a clear opinion that you can't isolate economics and
security from the policies of war and peace,'' Weizman said. ``The
peace today is sputtering and is limping -- and the economy along
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the successes and the more recent vascilations of the
Israeli economy may have more to do with the process of change
through the half century of Israel's existence.
</P>
<P>
   The kibbutz movement during and before the founding of the
Jewish state in 1948 was at the center of ``overturning the Jewish
pyramid,'' as kibbutzniks called it. It meant taking a highly
educated population of Jews from Europe after World War II with few
agricultural or industrial skills and creating a broad Jewish
workforce out of it. The ethos of Zionism and its Labor Party was
to glorify working the land and working with your hands to build
Israel. They needed brawn, not just brains, to create a state that
could survive economically and militarily.
</P>
<P>
   Israel now finds it needs once again to turn the pyramid, to go
back to the focus on education and continue its transition from an
agricultural and manufacturing economy into a global economy and
its requirements for a highly educated and trained workforce.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon Shulman, 42, an international lawyer who works with a
software company in Jerusalem, lives on Kibbutz Gezer and supports
the new high tech venture on the collective. Most of the nation's
250 kibbutzim and the roughly 120,000 people who live on them have
fallen on lean times in the last decade. But it's not because they
don't work hard. Although they represent only 3 percent of the
population, they provide 40 percent of the country's agriculture,
about 8 percent of its industrial output, and 10 percent of its
tourism. The reality is that the ethos of collective living has
faded, and so the kibbutzim will have to look for creative ways to
stay alive in the historic shift in Israel's economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways the kibbutzim are economically conservative. It
was a big risk for us to invest in Gezernet. But it is the right
decision,'' says Shulman, who lives on the kibbutz with his wife
and six-year-old daughter. ``Not only because information and
technology are the future. But because we will have to come up with
new ways to keep the next generation on the farm. We're doing it to
keep our community together. It's all about the future.''

CELTICS STAR ANTOINE WALKER SOUNDS OFF ON THINGS BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The coach wears prebleached, blue-jean shorts made by
Maurice Malone. So, officially, the huge ``M'' sewn into one of his
back pockets is the signature of the designer. But it could easily
stand for misunderstood. Ask yourself: Do you know him? Now, with
that response in tow, ask more than 200 Chicagoans, most of them
between ages 7 and 14, the same question.
</P>
<P>
   Of course you recognize Antoine Walker. He is hard to miss. He
is the tall one, 6 feet 9 inches, soon to be 22, wearing a white
T-shirt soaked with sweat. It is wet because the tall Celtic is now
going hoarse, calling for a fullcourt press during an all-star game
at his summer camp. Afterward, his campers will tell you how they
hung out with Coach Walker for six 6-hour days at Mount Carmel
High; watched videos and ate pizza with him; were instructed by
him; received autographed posters, equipment bags, and water
bottles from him and, most important, left with experiences and
memories that cost as much as the entry fee to ``Toine's Camps:
Chicago '98'': nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics and Rick Pitino recognize Walker, too. Do they know
him? Maybe they don't realize how he feels about his friends and
his profession, strong enough to say that Pitino's summer camps in
Boston are a waste of his time and that he will never attend.
``Never,'' he repeats. Maybe they don't know how he defines
loyalty, intense enough to say that he doesn't feel his coach is
supporting him, he isn't sure if he wants to play for him anymore,
sometimes he doesn't feel like a part of the team and that if the
NBA lockout ends soon enough for the Celtics to sign him in 1998
and they don't do it, he will say goodbye to Boston, guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe skeptics don't know how his sisters, Tywanna and Konosha,
influence several of his dances and how many of his moves are daily
love letters to them. Or how the cellphone that thrice fell from
that big ``M'' back pocket while he was coaching is used to keep in
constant contact with his mother, Diane. Or how he recently dropped
$12,000 to bankroll a struggling AAU team that needed funds for
trips to Atlanta and Las Vegas. There was even a meeting he set up
between adidas and his friend, Ed Hall, a man Walker thought would
be a nice fit with the athletic company's creative unit. We all
know that he is from Chicago, but do we know that most adults in
his family don't want him to play for the Bulls and would prefer he
stay in Boston? And since we are speaking of Boston, we must
mention contracts. Six years at $100 million? Walker insists that
Paul Gaston and Rick Pitino have never received such a demand, from
him nor his agent.
</P>
<P>
   Now ask yourself again: Do you know the man who has spent two
seasons improvising on the parquet? And remember, ask the children,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just do what I do,'' he says as he drives his silver
Mercedes Benz north on Lakeshore Drive. ``People always make their
own impression of you and, maybe, give you a title that you may not
want. So I just chill. What I do means more for the kids than what
the media will ever see, so I do it for the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   But what of the Celtics? Their future depends on their
understanding of Antoine Walker. He is their franchise player. They
must know everything they can about him. And although he says there
hasn't been a salary demand from him, you can be sure the price tag
will be significantly higher than the nonexistent one Chicago
adolescents paid to spend a few summer days with 'Toine.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Walker is inside his sparsely decorated loft, only a few
minutes from the United Center. There are pictures of Ron Mercer,
Chauncey Billups, and Walter McCarty. There are also pictures of
Walker with his friends from Chicago. On the floor is a videogame
that Walker masters, NBA Live. He leans back in a black leather
chair and discusses the only coach who impressed his mother four
years ago during recruiting season.
</P>
<P>
   He is asked why he didn't attend Pitino's summer camp. Two weeks
ago, Pitino said Walker's absence ``disappointed'' him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys need to go,'' Walker said. ``Some guys are rookies
and need it. I think it's fine for the guys who are in the area.
They are going to stay there and make Boston their home. That's
fine. But here, I have my own little thing I do (he works out with
several NBA players, Juwan Howard, Tim Hardaway, and Randy Brown
among them) and it's worked well for me so far in my career. What
do you want me to do, stop?''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino wasn't suggesting he stop his routine. But the coach did
question why Walker was in Vancouver, British Columbia, for the
draft with former Kentucky teammate Nazr Mohammed when he could
have been in Boston working out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Walker said, ``I think it's summertime. I'm on my own.
Nazr is a good friend of mine who asked me to be at his draft.
Coach Pitino never asked me personally; he never said he wanted me
to be (in Boston). He sent someone else to call me. I think that
has to be highlighted. If you want me there so bad, you have to
call and explain that to me. Then I could have told him I'm not
going to be there. Maybe if he said me being there would have made
everybody else come, then maybe I would have made that sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   ``But right now, there's too many negative comments being put in
the paper. I don't even feel like a part of the team. My intention
was to go. I would have went if I had known ahead of time. But then
I found out we were going there for individual workouts; I thought
we were going as a group, as a team, maybe get something
accomplished. We were going for individual workouts. I think that's
a waste of time. I can do that where I'm at in Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Walker will rise from his chair and excitedly clap
his hands. At that moment, the childrens' all-star game will be
conceived. It was not part of the original camp plan, but anyone
who knows Walker can tell you that he loves competition.
Eventually, he will sit down with 12-year-old Jamale Tidwell _ ``a
young blazer,'' Walker says, pointing to the gifted basketball
player _ and make sure he has a pair of new adidas, the company
with which Walker recently signed a 10-year contract. Eventually,
he will ask Tidwell if he will be OK getting home with the new
shoes because he knows that people sometimes do terrible things to
acquire new sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   But all that will happen later. Walker is upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot I have to evaluate right now,'' he says. ``Do I
want to stay in Boston? Do I want to play for Coach Pitino? And
right now, I don't think comments should be made. If your main goal
is to sign me, just say, ``My goal is to sign Antoine. We haven't
talked to him yet.' Don't make comments in the paper about, `Well,
Antoine wants too much money ...' when you haven't spoken to me
personally or my agent. And that's the thing that upsets me the
most. I don't want to get into the verbal back-and-forth of you
said this and you said that. But a person can only take so much of
negative publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   So does he want to stay in Boston? His uncle, Mike Walker, wants
him to stay (``Best place for him,'' he says). Mike Walker's
sister, Antoine's mother, wants him to stay (``Rick Pitino was the
only one who came to my home and stressed education,'' Diane Walker
says. ``He told me he would treat my son like his own and I
appreciated that.''). Does Walker, the All-Star, want to stay?

ENDEARING TALE OF TEEN TURMOIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
WHATEVER 
Directed and written by: Susan Skoog 
Starring: Lisa Weil, Chad Morgan, Frederic Forrest, Gary Wolf,
Kathryn Rossetter, Dan Montano, John G. Connolly 
Running time: 112 minutes 
Rated: R (pervasive teen drug and alcohol abuse, language including
sexual dialogue, sexuality and some violence) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Writer-director Susan Skoog not only gets all the notes right in
``Whatever.'' Her coming-of-age film gets all the grace notes
right, too. Skoog describes it as an emotional autobiography rather
than a factual account of her girlhood in New Jersey. High school
lies behind her. In the fall, her protagonist, Anna, hopes she's
headed to Cooper Union, Manhattan's prestigious, and free, art
school. Right now _ and although it's set in the 1980s, Skoog's
film very much exists in the emotional right now _ there is a
hellish summer to get through, and some unfinished business, like
putting behind her the vexing question of which boy she's going to
lose her virginity with.
</P>
<P>
   While the bedrooms of her contemporaries are festooned with
posters of rock stars, Anna's room is decorated with art posters,
especially Georgia O'Keeffe's. The distilled sexiness of O'Keeffe
is a quality Anna understands innately. She just hasn't taken it as
far as her role model, and it bothers her. She's more than a little
irritated by all the upbeat talk from her art teacher because it
reminds her how frightened she is of not living up to her own
expectations. Wrapped in a ratty sweater and carefully keeping the
corners of her mouth turned down so she won't seem too eager or too
vulnerable, Lisa Weil's Anna is one of the most endearing
about-to-break-out heroines of any film in years.
</P>
<P>
   If Anna steals petty cash from her mother to keep herself in
cigarettes, she's also touchingly compassionate toward her single
mom, too, sensing that she's got a lot of time to find what she
wants and her mother hasn't. Movingly, Skoog reverses the usual
generational warnings. When Anna's mom, played with just the right
touch of rumpled desperation by Kathryn Rossetter, starts trying
too hard to get something going with her married boss, it's Anna
who stays cool and lovingly warns her to cushion herself against
disappointment by not expecting too much. Anna is afraid, too. What
she's afraid of is being ordinary. With an exquisitely gauged sense
of balance, Skoog nudges Weil's Anna into rebellion more dutifully
than angrily, and with a backward glance at the safety net she's
leaving behind.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Anna has chosen her best friend, Brenda (Chad Morgan),
partly for her potential as a rebellion mentor. But here, too,
Skoog takes the trouble to present Brenda as dimensioned,
feelingful, and not just eccentric. If there's a certain wildness
to the arc of her flight from her family, it's because her family
gives her a lot to flee. Anna and Brenda give the film all the
heart and stylistic contrast any film needs, but Skoog rounds it
out by casting her young-men-as-trouble with an eye to humor and
more than a little authenticity of feeling, too. And Wheeling,
W.Va., does a convincing job of standing in for Red Bank, N.J. In
its quiet way, ``Whatever'' deals with believable post-adolescent
turmoil, but never self-indulgently, and it never relinquishes its
claim on your attention or compassion.

MARKET CONDITIONS REQUIRE A WAIT-AND-SEE STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 19 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I presently have two 403(b) accounts. We each
have $17,000 in Fidelity Contrafund and $41,000 in Vanguard Index
500. Each of us adds $200 a month to the Vanguard account. Since
both funds we hold are growth funds and the word is to get ready
for a market correction, I know we are too heavily invested in
stocks, and that we should balance our funds to offset a possible
plunge or correction in the market. We are both teachers, and I can
retire in four years at age 54, and my wife in six years at age 53.
We realize we won't be able to touch these 403(b) accounts until
age 59 1/2. What do you suggest we do to help balance our funds to
get the best bang for our buck?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A.M. &LR; ,  &UR; Hurst, Texas  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Since your time frame here is in the area of 10 to 12 years,
I don't suggest any drastic get-ready-for-the-crash approach. For
one thing, even though I think the market in general is currently
overvalued, neither I nor anybody else knows when, or how, this
might be corrected. Sometimes overpriced markets get back to
reality by simply moving sideways for a number of months until
earnings and dividends reach levels to justify the prices.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, as in 1987, a dramatic decline is almost immediately
followed by a renewed bull market; the people who got spooked when
the crash came probably missed a good part of the bull market that
followed. In fact, there are studies that show that even if people
generally manage to call the market's trends, they usually end up
in a worse situation than the buy-and-hold types if they miss only
a few days at the beginning of a bull market.
</P>
<P>
   So I don't suggest drastic changes because of the state of the
market. But I do suggest a lot of changes because your portfolio is
pretty poorly diversified. Both Fidelity Contrafund and Vanguard
Index 500 hold portfolios of stocks that represent a blend of
growth- and value-oriented large-cap stocks. Both have done very
nicely for the past few years as these large-cap stocks have
represented the primary driving force behind the market. But it's
reasonable to expect that even if the market remains healthy, these
stocks are likely to take a breather. That's why a typical
retirement portfolio will include large positions in funds such as
the two which you hold -- both of which are frequently treated as
core holdings -- but also smaller positions in mid-cap, small-cap,
international, and perhaps even a couple of sector funds. A typical
breakdown for a fairly aggressive saver who's 10 years from drawing
on the money might put 40 percent in the core holding, 15 percent
each in mid- cap, small-cap and international holdings, and the
final 15 percent split among sector holdings such as health care
and technology. A more cautious person in the same position might
hold 30 percent in the core position, 15 percent in an
equity-income fund, 15 percent in a balanced fund, 15 percent in an
income-oriented fund such as a GNMA offering, with the final 25
percent divided among mid-cap, small-cap, and international funds.
I don't know what the menu of options available to you through your
403(b) accounts, but most plans offer investment options such
categories. So I suggest you decide whether you want to take a
conservative or more aggressive stance, and then diversify along
the lines I suggest above.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 56 years old and would like to retire at age 60 with an
income of $40,000 a year. At that point, my pension will be $30,000
a year. We have $10,000 in savings, $7,000 in common stock, a
$4,500 IRA, and a 401(k) plan of $182,000 of which 30 percent is in
an equity income fund, 30 percent in Fidelity Magellan, and 40
percent in Vanguard Index 500 fund. Contributions to that plan,
including my employer's match, come to $17,500 a year. I have a
$18,000 loan against the 401(k), which I am paying off at the rate
of $300 a month. I will have an additional $300 a month to invest
beginning in September. Can we achieve $40,000 annual income at
retirement? How should I invest the $300 a month for the next four
years? How should I handle the loan balance? Am I dividing my
401(k) investments correctly?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; K.M. &LR; ,  &UR; Philadelphia &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, the easy part of the answer is that you should have no
problem coming up with the additional $10,000 a year to augment
your pension in retirement. If we presume 8 percent average annual
growth over the next four years, and if we presume continued
contributions at current levels, the pool would be $329,343 at
retirement -- more than twice what you'd need to generate that
$10,000 without invading the principal.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems to me that with retirement drawing closer, now is a
good time to reorganize the portfolio both so it will be in the
right configuration by the time you retire, and also to reduce
risk. Currently you have all of the 401(k) money in common stock.
Let's presume that you decide that upon retirement you'll want to
have half of the 401(k) month in fixed-income holdings and the rest
remaining in stocks -- designed to give you long-term capital
appreciation as a hedge against in inflation during the later years
of retirement. My suggestion would be to make the move now. You
don't spell out the options in the 401(k) plan, but almost all of
them have a fixed-income offering such as a GNMA fund, a government
bond fund, or a bond index fund. I suggest you change the current
allocation so 50 percent is in such a vehicle, and also direct that
half of the ongoing contributions go there as well.
</P>
<P>
   As for the $300 a month you will be able to add to your
investments in September, I suggest that you begin by adding that
amount to your 401(k) loan repayments, accelerating the process of
eliminating the loan. Once that's done, I would open a Roth IRA if
you are eligible to do so, and if not open a taxable account, again
invested in a fixed-income investment such as I spelled out above.
</P>
<P>
   I realize that this may seem to contradict the advice I gave to
A.M. above, but even though you both will retire in about four
years, he will be leaving his funds untouched for 9 1/2 years, and
his wife for 12 1/2 years -- thus making those long-term accounts.
In your case, you'll be relying on about half of your savings to
produce an income stream within four years -- so that portion
becomes short-term money, and thus it should be conservatively
invested. The remaining funds are appropriate for stocks, since you
probably won't be drawing on them for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you take my advice and put half of the 401(k) money into
a fixed-income fund. I would then suggest that, like A.M. above,
you look for a little more diversification.
</P>
<P>
   You're probably in the about the same situation, with your fund
portfolios concentrated among large-cap stocks; and a broader
diversification on the stock side of the portfolio would probably
serve you better.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In a previous column you said if the questioner is now in a
low tax bracket and will be in a low tax bracket upon retirement,
conversion to a Roth IRA would make no difference. If $50,000 were
converted to a Roth IRA and gained at the rate of 8 percent
annually, after 10 years it would be approximately 107,000, having
growth by $57,000. Isn't this a good reason for conversion to a
Roth, even assuming the tax rate remains the same?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; D.E., Dunstable, Mass. &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Sorry, but the numbers work out the same. I think you're
forgetting about the time value of the money that you would be
paying in taxes upon the Roth conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Let's suppose the tax on the conversion of a $50,000 IRA for a
low tax bracket person came to a grand total of $10,000, payable in
four annual installments of $2,500 each.
</P>
<P>
   Now suppose than instead of converting, the person simply put
that $2,500 a year into an investment earning the same 8 percent.
After the four payments and six further years of uninterrupted
growth, the account would amount to $19,305 -- trust me, precisely
the amount of taxes that would be due on withdrawals from a
traditional IRA (provided they were made on a schedule to keep the
taxpayer in the same low bracket). The only reasons that someone
who expects to be in the same tax bracket upon withdrawal as they
are upon conversion to a Roth is the additional flexibility allowed
for withdrawal from a Roth, and the prospect that the tax structure
might change for the worse in the intervening years.

BIG BUSINESS, BAD BLOOD AT THE MFA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes I worry that I underestimate our fair city. This
spring, I was startled to read that Europeans regard Boston's
Symphony Hall as the finest concert house in North America. And not
until a few days ago did I know that the Museum of Fine Arts's
retail operation _ you know, the people who hustle all that Monet
kitsch _ is one of the three largest museum retail outfits in the
country. Ringing up over $40 million in annual sales, MFA
Enterprises rivals better-known sales operations like the
Smithsonian and New York's Met in both volume and profitability.
</P>
<P>
   But Enterprises has seen troubles, too. In a little over four
years, four executives have run the business. Francois Poulet, whom
insiders credit with building Enterprises to its current stature,
was summarily fired in May 1994. In Poulet v. Museum of Fine Arts,
an age-discrimination and defamation suit filed last year, Poulet
claims that the chairman of the MFA board made disparaging
allusions to his age _ he was in his late 50s _ and that the museum
twice tried to replace him with younger, less experienced
executives. Furthermore, he says that the museum understated
Enterprises profits in 1994 to make him look bad, and then trashed
his performance in interviews with the Globe and Boston Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``We contend that the suit has no merit,'' says John Stanley,
the MFA's deputy director for operations. Some people who worked
with Poulet say the suit is absurd, and that he lost control of the
business during his lengthy stewardship. The legal brouhaha has
proved extremely divisive. It casts an unflattering light on the
business staff, who accept low salaries in return for the
satisfaction of working at the MFA. Also, Poulet's wife, Anne,
remains at the MFA as a curator of European decorative arts and
sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   Post-Poulet, his job has turned over rapidly. His successor,
Janet Emerson, is credited with putting the business on even keel.
After less than a year, she left to become chief executive of
Learningsmith. Museum staffer Frank Heath took over after her, but
he checked out late last year in a ``difference over the direction
of the business,'' according to Stanley. Last month, Dan Reardon,
formerly of Bass Shoes, took the reins.
</P>
<P>
   Reardon's looking at a terrific 1998, because _ ker-ching! _
here comes that old guy in the blue smock again. That's right; the
MFA is going back to the well, meaning the cash register, with
another vast, overhyped Monet show, this one called ``Monet in the
Twentieth Century.'' You know what they say in the art world _ How
do you spell money? &QC; 
M-O-N-E-T.

<P>
   Houghton Mifflin is embroiled in a trademark dispute over one of
its most valuable properties, the children's book character Curious
George. Quite by accident, a Houghton legal scout noticed that a
New York-based punk rock band named Furious George had filed a
trademark request in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, there's unlikely to be much confusion between
the benign tales of the furry little monkey and the band's work,
which features such songs as ``Betty Crocker, Punk Rocker,'' and
``Gilligan.'' (Sample lyric: ``I wear a white hat/I wear a red
shirt/They all think I'm stupid/One day I'll kill them.'') However,
FG's albums, which are hard to find, bear the same squiggly logo
type and blaring yellow graphics of the famous books by Margret and
H.A. Rey. Houghton execs aren't the least bit bashful about beating
on the band. ``There's no First Amendment issue here,'' says
Houghton corporate counsel Lois Wasoff. ``They're trying to trade
commercially on a name, look, and character that we've been
investing in for 50 years.''
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't reach the band. However, in a letter to the New York
Observer, ``Furious George'' Trapp denounced ``the (expletives)
over at Houghton Mifflin for ``(squelching) the voice of the
people.'' Tired of this subject? You ain't seen nothing yet.
Universal Studios plans to release a Curious George live action
film some time next year. Soundtrack by Furious George? I don't
think so.

NETSCAPE PUSHES ITS NEW BROWSER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Netscape says its latest Web browser software
extends a helping hand to Internet newcomers, but critics say its
new filtering features are another step towards commercializing the
World Wide Web's anarchic nature.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape's Communicator 4.5, which debuted Thursday, is labeled
as a fractional update of the Mountain View, Calif., company's
market leading 4.0 browser. But some of browser's new capabilities
are marking it as more than a simple upgrade. Bob Lisbonne,
Netscape's senior vice president of client products, has labeled
4.5 a ``fundamental sea change'' for the browser.
</P>
<P>
   Internet civil libertarian Stanton McCandlish says its another
step in the ``TV-ization'' of the Web. What sparks these polar
opposites are two new features: ``Internet keywords'' and ``What's
related,'' collectively dubbed ``smart browsing''
</P>
<P>
   The first feature, Internet keywords, is activated when a user
types plain words instead of a specific URL into Communicator 4.5's
address box. The browser will then automatically head over to a 1.5
million word database residing on Netscape's own computers. That
list then generates a link to a Web site picked by Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's related'' is a button that now sits next to the Web
address box. Press it and up pops a list of other relevant web
sites. Those links are created from a roster of 12 million web
addresses gathered by Excite, a popular internet search and
indexing site partnered with Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Lisbonne says the new features help users _ especially Internet
rookies _ navigate the morass of data that is the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many new users are daunted by the sheer sea of information
that's available (on the Web),'' Lisbonne said. ``(These features)
are a fast forward on their learning curve.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisbonne said that eliminating the information overload
generated by ordinary Web searches makes Net surfing a ``richer
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The databases backing smart browsing work by choosing _ and
excluding _ Web sites. In other words, not all Web sites will be
available to a smart browsing user.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lisbonne, Netscape is giving smart browsing
database preference to trademarks and other corporate and
governmental sites, excluding parody or other ``inappropriate'' Web
pages that Lisbonne said ``take advantage'' of the typing errors of
a less-than-careful Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when a 4.5 user types ``White House'' into the
4.5's address block, they are sent directly to the official
presidential Web site (www.whitehouse.org). A miss hit while typing
in the White House URL in older browsers has landed more than a few
people onto a pornographic page (www.whitehouse.com).
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an appropriate use of the feature,'' said Lisbonne. The
Netscape executive is quick to point out that users can still
access any Web site they choose by directly typing the URL into the
address bar.
</P>
<P>
   McCandlish says the features raise some concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to keep in mind that there are deals going on in
the background when they're letting someone else pick their Web
sites for them,'' says McCandlish, program director for Internet
civil liberties group Electronic Frontier Foundation. ``They need
to know that they're not getting a complete response when they do
one of these simple word look-ups. And they're getting sites picked
because of corporate deals, not because they're the best sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Netscape is anticipating future disputes over the rights to the
ownership of the smart browsing keywords and placement on the
``what's related'' lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to make some decisions on how this is covered in
the future,'' said Lisbonne. ``We'll have to work with our partners
and try and do the right thing.'' Netscape closed at 33-and-1/4
Thursday, up 1-and-13/16~.

BANDERAS CUTS A SEXY SWATH IN ZORRO'S TRIUMPHAL RETURN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
THE MASK OF ZORRO 
Directed by: Martin Campbell 
Screenplay by: John Eskow, Ted Elliott &AMP;and Terry Rossio (based on
Johnston McCulley's character) 
Starring: Antonio Banderas, Anthony Hopkins, Catherine Zeta-Jones,
Stuart Wilson, Matt Letscher, Tony Amendola 
Running time: 136 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (some intense action and violence) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Zorro is back, with more swashbuckling panache than ever. ``The
Mask of Zorro'' proves that Antonio Banderas can hold his own with
the long, honorable line of Zorros that began with Douglas
Fairbanks Sr. in 1920 and included Tyrone Power. There were a lot
of ways ``The Mask of Zorro'' could have gone wrong and not many
ways it could ride into the '90s with dash and richness. For a
moment you wonder as Martin Campbell reminds us he directed
``GoldenEye'' in the way Zorro strides into the frame a la James
Bond over the opening credits. But this ``Zorro'' is more than a
throwback to the acrobatic compadre of Robin Hood and The Scarlet
Pimpernel; he's a revitalization of a romantic hero who had already
staked out the franchise concept when ``Jaws'' and ``Rocky'' were
barely a couple of gleams in Hollywood's eye.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the film confines itself to one Zorro. One of the
things that gives it breadth and weight is Anthony Hopkins's
performance as the older Zorro. He imparts gravity and nobility to
the story as an aristocrat secretly championing the poor, about to
call it a career after the sensational rescue of a trio of peasants
and the recall to Spain of the cruel colonial governor, Don
Montero. But then he's unmasked and thrown into prison over the
dead body of his wife. His infant daughter is kidnapped by Don
Montero and raised as his own child.
</P>
<P>
   The prologue sets the stage for the entrance of the new Zorro,
20 years later, as Don Montero (Stuart Wilson) returns to Mexico,
plotting to buy California from Mexico's liberator, General Santa
Ana, with gold stolen from Mexico. Hopkins's Don Diego de la Vega,
escaped from prison, is about to assassinate him when he notices
that the beautiful young woman Montero helps from a carriage is his
own daughter, who is unaware of her true parentage. So he switches
to Plan B, plucking one of two grown orphan brothers from a
cantina, teaching him everything he knows, turning him into his
instrument of revenge.
</P>
<P>
   The new Zorro, naturally, is Banderas, and his initial
clumsiness is engaging. It isn't long, however, until he gets his
act together and becomes an accomplished horseman, swordsman, whip
wielder, and romancer of Don Diego's daughter, the beautiful
Catherine Zeta-Jones, who at one point engages him in a sexy
swordfight. Just as Hopkins's old fox is spoiling for a fight with
Wilson's smooth villain, Banderas builds to a showdown with the
Don's cruel and kinky right-hand man, interestingly played by Matt
Letscher as a psychotic who killed the new Zorro's brother and
carries his head around in a bottle. Overall, though, the film's
avoidance of campy humor and its reliance on solid narrative and
viscerally appealing acrobatics as opposed to mere effects is so
novel in today's moviegoing climate that it seems almost
refreshingly innovative.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's direction is usefully class-conscious, generating
suspense when Banderas's hastily trained peasant must insinuate
himself into Don Montero's social circle. There's always a gap
between Hopkins's born aristocrat and Banderas's posed one. On the
other hand, Banderas is physically all one could hope for as Zorro,
convincingly lithe and athletic, and charismatically romantic to
boot. Zeta-Jones is no passive heroine, either, and her physical
abilities more than equal her good looks. Add to that Wilson's
avoidance of scenery-chewing as the villain and the new ``Zorro''
is a handsome and satisfying balancing act. Packed with gymnastics
and richly evocative Mexican locales, it's the most resplendently
exuberant and best-looking ``Zorro'' ever, as well as the sexiest.

SCHRODER'S FUTURE IS TRUE `BLUE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; PASADENA, &UR;  &LR; Calif. _ When ABC announced that Rick Schroder
would replace Jimmy Smits on ``N.Y.P.D. Blue'' this season, fans of
the show heaved a collective ``Huh?'' Little Ricky Schroder, the
blond child TV star from ``Silver Spoons,'' as a tough-talking New
York detective? You might as well pair Dennis Franz's Detective
Andy Sipowicz with Danny Bonaduce.
</P>
<P>
   But when you see Schroder today, a 28-year-old man with a
tightly wound physical presence, the casting choice makes perfect
sense. Schroder has an unexpected rough-hewn energy and a New York
accent (he's from Staten Island) that will serve him well when he
joins the 15th Precinct this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Bochco, who created and executive-produces the series
with David Milch, says the goal was never to replace Smits, whose
Bobby Simone will be written out of the show in the first six
episodes of the season. ``We've always had in the back of our minds
that we would like to add a younger character,'' he says. Bochco
and Milch approached a number of actors for the part, and had them
read with Franz. ``In the scene that Rick did that was written for
Simone,'' says Milch, ``he did it in an entirely different way, and
brought his own colors to the performance. That's a real pleasure
for a writer, when you see an actor beat the page or turn it''
upside down.
</P>
<P>
   The ``N.Y.P.D.'' creators are keeping what they know about
Schroder's character under wraps. The only detail they will divulge
is that he will be joining Sipowicz after a stint in the narcotics
department. And they say they are still developing the details of
the young detective, who doesn't even have a name yet. Recently,
Milch says, he ran excitedly into Bochco's office, saying, ``You
know who this guy is, you know what his name is? His name is Jack
Wayne. And you know why his name is Jack Wayne? Because his real
name is John Wayne, and when Sipowicz finds out he calls him
Duke!'' Sadly for Milch, but happily for viewers, Bochco met
Milch's revelation with silence.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Bochco and Milch needed to create a new character
for ``N.Y.P.D. Blue,'' of course, they didn't have the luxury of
time to flesh out the character carefully. By the time David Caruso
decided to leave the show after its first season, the pair had
already written five scripts including him for the second season.
``David and I, David primarily, really invented Jimmy's character
on the fly,'' says Bochco. ``It must have taken us the better part
of a full season before we began to really feel comfortable with
who this guy was and how he functioned in the unit.''
</P>
<P>
   Bochco and Milch say that Kim Delaney, whose character is
married to Smits's, will remain on the show after Smits's
departure. ``She functions in the show independent of Jimmy,'' says
Milch. Bochco says he hopes that Sharon Lawrence, who plays
Sipowicz's wife, will make more regular appearances on ``N.Y.P.D.
Blue'' now that her own show, ``Fired Up,'' has been canceled. ``I
think she's going to be very much a part of what we're doing this
coming season.''
</P>
<P>
   Will the Smits-Schroder change-over bring creative renewal to
``N.Y.P.D. Blue''? Last season, the series' fifth, was seen by
critics and many fans as its least inspired. ``In the fifth year of
any show,'' says Bochco, ``you don't have gross revelations for
your strong drama and for your strong character stories.'' He says
the show has become ``more complicated, subtle, like close
harmony.''
</P>
<P>
   Milch says he does hope that Schroder's presence will bring new
energy to the show, as the characters ``are going to be adjusting
to him in very interesting ways. ... Steven and I and the writing
staff, and our actors, and, in particular, Dennis, have always
tried to embrace change and see its new possibilities.''

   Schroder, who lives on a Colorado ranch with his wife and three
children, says he's never been much of an ``N.Y.P.D. Blue'' viewer.
``I don't have the discipline to sit down every day at a certain
time to watch TV. ... When I do watch TV, it's usually A&AMP;E or the
Discovery Channel.''
</P>
<P>
   His family life away from the TV industry is what has protected
him from the potentially harmful effects of child stardom, he says.
``Third grade was my last grade of formal education,'' he adds. ``I
don't know why I succeeded, but I have a pretty tenacious attitude
... that works to my advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he really dislike being called ``Ricky,'' as the press has
reported over the years? ``It doesn't bother me at all,'' he says.
``My mother and my wife call me Ricky.'' Years ago, he says, his
agent suggested the change to ``create a new persona'' for him. ``I
think about it for two seconds and I say, `OK.' And then some
people ... started making fun of it. So I got really torqued one
day, being made fun of over it ... and it created this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that he's joining ``N.Y.P.D. Blue,'' of course, he'll need
to share not only his heart and his soul but his butt with viewers,
in keeping with the show's trademark nudity. ``My wife says I've
got a great one,'' he says confidently.

GAY LOVE IS BLAND IN `BROADWAY DAMAGE' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 For use by New York Times News Service clients)   By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
BROADWAY DAMAGE 
Written and directed by: Victor Mignatti 
Starring: Mara Hobel, Michael Shawn Lucas, Hugh Panaro, Aaron
Williams 
Running time: 110 minutes 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Broadway Damage'' is a lot like its main characters _ pleasant
and inoffensive, with not a lasting thought in its pretty little
head.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Mignatti's fanciful film is a New York fairy tale
disguised as a romantic comedy. How else to explain the fact that
Marc (Michael Shawn Lucas) and his best galpal Cynthia (Mara Hobel)
manage to find a two-bedroom apartment in Greenwich Village for
under $2,000 a month, let alone under $1,000? Even if you have sex
with the building's superintendent, which Marc does, you
ain't &UR;  &LR; getting a Village apartment with running water, functioning
appliances, and a private bathroom for anything things less than
$10,000 under the table, and perhaps your firstborn.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Broadway Damage'' isn't as interested in reality as in the
telling of this blandly sweet gay romance.
</P>
<P>
   Marc is an aspiring actor, who can't seem to land any work
because casting directors find him to soft (read: too gay). His
nebbishy best friend Robert (Aaron Williams) is also an actor and a
musician who has a major love jones for Marc. But he believes the
hunky blond is simply out of his romantic league. Robert isn't
nearly as much of a goober as he thinks he is, but he needs to lose
the glasses, Garanimals clothing, and shaggy bangs.
</P>
<P>
   But what chance does Robert stand with a guy magnet like Marc,
who attracts the amorous attention of his musician neighbor David
(Hugh Panaro). If David seems too good to be true, of course, he
is. But the film never betrays its good, boring heart or its
inevitable happy ending. The untrustworthy David is never more than
an attractive nuisance; one look at Robert's lovelorn eyes in
Marc's presence, and you know exactly who will end up with whom.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cynthia is a Long Island rich kid determined to make
her way without Daddy's money, although she spends what little she
has at Bloomingdale's and any other store still willing to accept
her overworked credit cards. To his credit, Mignatti allows Hobel's
Cynthia to be more than Marc's zaftig het friend. She actually gets
a love scene with a marriage-minded boyfriend, and there's a
running gag about her increasingly desperate attempts to reach Tina
Brown, then editor of The New Yorker, for a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Broadway Damage'' is terrible. We've seen all this before, and
it's usually been better. Disappointingly, what Mignatti ends up
with is a genteel gay comedy when he needed a few more sharp
elbows.

MASS. LAW WOULD LIMIT SUITS AGAINST HMOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER   AND ALEX PHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While Senator Edward Kennedy, President Clinton,
and other Democrats push for a new right for patients to sue
health-maintenance organizations, a state law may block
Massachusetts residents from taking full advantage of any new
federal legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: The state's four largest HMOs are structured as
charitable organizations. Under state law, damages for negligence
and injury against charities are capped at $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Congress makes it easier for patients to sue health
insurers, ``at first blush, our view is that the cap would still
apply to HMOs,'' said Barbara Anthony, chief of the Massachusetts
attorney general's public protection bureau. ``But we have not
thoroughly researched this issue, and we have not litigated it.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal law leaves little room for most Americans to sue
insurers who refuse to pay for medical care, even if the result is
a cancer that spreads, a depression that deepens, or other harm.
Democrats say that if patients had more rights to sue HMOs,
insurers would no longer have a financial incentive to protect
their profits by denying patient care.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have made the right to sue a centerpiece of their
broad HMO legislation, which would also give patients more rights
to see specialists and visit an emergency room, and require HMOs to
have a formal process for appealing decisions concerning care. The
two major Republican plans include some of the provisions favored
by Democrats, but most Republicans oppose an expanded right to sue.
Instead, they say, a stronger appeals process would protect
patients without resorting to costly litigation.
</P>
<P>
   The limitations on lawsuits are in a 1974 law, and they apply to
the estimated 125 million Americans whose health plans are
sponsored by their employers. The law says that a patient may sue
for the cost of a doctor visit, test or other service denied by an
insurer, but not for any harm that might have been caused by the
denial of medical care.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress expands the right to sue, it is unclear what effect
the expansion would have on the four largest HMOs in Massachusetts:
Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of
Massachusetts, Tufts Health Plan, and Fallon Community Health Plan.
Several factors could come into play:
</P>
<P>
   _How the law is changed. Democrats are seeking to remove the
hurdle in federal law that limits lawsuits, leaving states to set
their own rules on HMO suits. That strategy would leave in place
the $20,000 cap on claims against charities, said Myra J. Green, a
lawyer at Choate Hall &AMP; Stewart in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But if Congress creates a new right to sue, which is less
likely, federal law may preempt the cap on damages, Green said.
</P>
<P>
   _The types of cases that patients pursue. Even if the cap
limited damages for an HMO's alleged negligence in denying
coverage, patients might be able to win larger damage awards by
suing under different legal theories such as breach of contract,
said Laurie Martinelli, a lawyer with Health Law Advocates in
Boston. However, other lawyers say that strategy may not succeed in
the courts.
</P>
<P>
   _Whether state courts continue to view HMOs as charities.
Anthony of the attorney general's office said that the Supreme
Judicial Court has never ``definitively'' decided that HMOs are
charities for the purposes of the state cap on damage awards.
</P>
<P>
   At Blue Cross, spokeswoman Susan Leahy said that the company's
charitable status was written into the state legislation that
helped create the company. At Harvard Pilgrim, spokesman Alan
Raymond said the company's charitable immunity was challenged only
once, in a 1981 tax case, ``and our charitable status was upheld in
court.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stephen J. Lyons, a lawyer with the Boston firm Klieman &AMP;
Lyons, said an HMO may be sued for more than $20,000 if the damages
arise from actions that are not part of a charitable mission. He
said the Supreme Judicial Court had ruled, in a case not involving
an HMO, that an activity is not charitable if it is intended to
raise revenues.

GEORGE THOROGOOD KICKS BACK INTO GEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Conversing with George Thorogood is like riding a runaway
stagecoach. Be prepared for some wild one-liners. ``Rock 'n' roll
never sleeps. It just passes out,'' Thorogood says with a laugh
from Los Angeles. Then this admission: ``People used to say I was a
maverick and that I did things my own way. Hey, if I knew the way,
I'd do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yup, George is back, in all his wise-cracking glory. He never
pretended to have all of the answers, but he's sure got a few of
them. ``I didn't write the book, but I read it,'' he says of his
basic love of showmanship. ``I just do it the way it's supposed to
be done _ the same way that (Bob) Seger, the Stones, and the Geils
Band have done it.''
</P>
<P>
   That way is to go all-out in concert _ something that Thorogood
has done for years as leader of the Destroyers, formerly the
Delaware Destroyers. The bill also features Bo Diddley, Kelly
Willis, Nils Lofgren, Steve Morse (no relation to this writer),
James Cotton, and others.
</P>
<P>
   Thorogood is back in business after several years in which he's
switched managers, switched record labels (look for him to pop up
with an album on BMG next year), and welcomed the arrival of a
daughter, who's only a few months old.
</P>
<P>
   He still performed, but not as often as his barnstorming days.
``I've been keeping my hand in and doing a little spot-pouring, you
might say,'' he notes of his recent low profile, which has come
after years of vigorously hitting the road with a repertory heavily
steeped in Thorogood-ized covers of songs by Chuck Berry, John Lee
Hooker, Bo Diddley, Johnny Cash, Hank Williams, and other roots
luminaries, along with some witty, boys-night-out original songs
such as ``Bad to the Bone,'' a big hit on MTV during the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Thorogood, a former semi-pro baseball player who used to book
concerts around his baseball schedule, has never quite fit in,
wherever he's been. ``Hey, you wouldn't be in rock 'n' roll if you
were a popular guy in high school,'' he says from personal
experience.
</P>
<P>
   In his one overt plug for the Gibson Guitar Festival, he says,
``If it weren't for the Gibson company, I wouldn't be talking to
you now. I can't play any other guitar.''
</P>
<P>
   Thorogood, who hails from Wilmington, Del., used to play the New
England area frequently when he recorded for Rounder Records in
Cambridge, Mass. in the late '70s, before moving on to a major
label. He used to call his shows ``rock 'n' roll hootenannies.''
Talking about those shows, he says, ``I used to play `One Bourbon,
One Scotch, One Beer' for 40 minutes. You guys thought I had great
energy, but I just didn't have any more songs.''
</P>
<P>
   Thorogood's Destroyers were originally a trio with bassist Billy
Blough and drummer Jeff Simon, but they added saxophonist Hank
Carter in the '80s. ``He's our Clarence Clemons,'' Thorogood says,
referring to Bruce Springsteen's sax man.
</P>
<P>
   When last seen in this area four years ago, Thorogood &AMP; Co. were
co-billed with Little Feat at Great Woods. They toured with ZZ Top
for three weeks last summer, but were not on the Great Woods show,
even though their name was advertised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to do three more weeks with ZZ Top, but we never got
a confirmation,'' he says. ``But promoters went ahead and printed
it up as if we were going to do it. Sometimes promoters are
overeager.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Thorogood, who did a legendary tour with the
Stones and Geils Band in the early '80s, wanted to do some dates
with John Fogerty, but those didn't happen. ``I've always been a
fan of packaging. The fans get more wallop that way,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   You can expect that wallop in Newport next weekend. It's a
great-sounding package _ and you know Thorogood &AMP; Co. will be there
to take care of business.
</P>

Kiss '65'' from a black van parked close to where the paparazzi
gathered outside Streisand's Malibu villa. The song was played at
full volume for four hours. One photographer called it
``psychological warfare,'' but another said, ``At least it's not
Streisand music.'' Zombie has a new album, ``HellbillyDeluxe,'' due
out Aug. 25. Wonder if the Streisand reps will dig that one.

REVIVING THE SOUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The golden age of soul music is back. Reviving the tradition of
the barnstorming bus tours of the '50s and '60s are eight pioneers
who have formed the ``Royal Soul Revue.'' Such artists as Lloyd
Price, Percy Sledge, Irma Thomas, Ben E. King, and Jerry Butler may
not strike an immediate chord with a new generation, but they are
pioneers who influenced Stevie Wonder, Van Morrison, Whitney
Houston, Mick Jagger, and other acts way too numerous to mention.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the ladies and gentlemen who defined soul music.
They are the originators,'' says Peter Wolf, the former J. Geils
Band singer. ``This is a real opportunity for anyone interested in
American music. I'm just going to be a gushing fan.''
</P>
<P>
   Let the gushing begin, because this is a package tour of
historic proportions. You'll hear two of the all-time soul ballads
in Sledge's ``When a Man Loves a Woman'' (revived a few years ago
in a Grammy-winning version by Michael Bolton) and Butler's ``For
Your Precious Love.''
</P>
<P>
   You'll hear artists who are still vital after two, three, and
four decades on the circuit, including Gene Chandler (``Duke of
Earl''), Chuck Jackson (former lead singer of the Del Vikings), and
Ben E. King (``Spanish Harlem,'' ``Stand by Me'').
</P>
<P>
   They promise a fast-paced revue evoking the heyday of New York's
Apollo Theater _ a time when Motown, Stax, and Atlantic Rec-ords
churned out soul hits with an amazing consistency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is excited about this tour. There's a good feeling
among the performers _ most of us have known each other for years.
And we think that the baby boomers who bought this music are the
ones who need it now to reconnect with their youth, just like the
people before us had Sinatra and Satchmo,'' says Lloyd Price, a New
Orleans star who re-corded the raucous ``Lawdy Miss Clawdy'' in
1952.
</P>
<P>
   Price, now a youthful 64, wrote the song after listening to New
Orleans disc jockey ``Okey Dokey'' Smith recite this commercial for
Maxwell House coffee: ``Lawdy Miss Clawdy, eat them mother homemade
pies and drink that Maxwell House coffee.'' The song featured Fats
Dom-ino on piano and was later re-corded by everyone from Elvis
Presley to Little Richard. Price used to sing it at interracial
dances in armories, tobacco warehouses, and other alternative sites
down South.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were so many white kids that the black kids couldn't get
in,'' he recalls of some shows. ``But by 10 o'clock, everyone was
dancing together. That was revolutionary at the time and the
Dixiecrats couldn't stand it. Then I was drafted (into the Army)
and the draft board told me they couldn't figure out what I was
doing with this `Lawdy Miss Clawdy' business and that's why I was
drafted.''
</P>
<P>
   Price went on to make the seminal hits ``Just Because'' (which
John Lennon and Fleetwood Mac later recorded), ``Stagger Lee,'' and
``Personality,'' while forming his own rec-ord company (LL
Records), which put out the first hits by Wilson Pickett. Price was
also a bowling partner of Motown founder Berry Gordy and personal
friend of boxing champ Muhammad Ali. Along the way, he also managed
to own three clubs, two liquor stores, and live in Africa 10 years.
Currently, he coordinates affordable housing for the needy in New
York. To say he's lived a full life is an understatement.
</P>
<P>
   The glory days of soul music saw a different performance ethic,
one that comes out in the current tour. Artists will sing three to
five songs each, coming out in succession and backed by the same
band _ an all-star unit directed by G.E. Smith (former ``Saturday
Night Live'' guitarist) and boasting the Uptown Horns, who have
toured with the Rolling Stones.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have a lot of downtime in a show like this. There is
never more than three minutes between acts,'' says Butler, who once
sang with the Impressions, where he shared the stage with the great
Curtis Mayfield. ``I think a lot now is lost in terms of
performance. People have to reset the stage and redo the lighting
between sets. So much is spent on technology, but the flow gets
lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler now lives in Chicago and is commissioner of Cook County,
overseeing ``the paying of bills and raising of taxes,'' he says.
But he's committed to keeping the soul music era alive and is
writing a book called ``Only the Strong Survive,'' which will tell
of concert bus tours run by the agencies Supersonic Attractions and
General Artists Corporation. He recalls tours with the likes of
Chuck Jackson, Clyde McPhatter, Dion, the Shirelles, Ruth Brown,
and Illinois Jacquet.
</P>
<P>
   Butler says he remembers the first R&AMP;B song that used a string
section (the Drifters' ``There Goes My Baby'') and why the music of
the '50s and '60s was so groundbreaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The music of America has always been a composite,'' he says.
``You had the European influence that turned into folk and country.
You had the black experience that turned into folk, blues, and
gospel. And layered on top was the music of Tin Pan Alley,
Broadway, and avant-garde jazz. All of this music was rolling
around in a fishbowl called America _ and all of us were stealing
from each other. You also had the civil rights era affecting it.
You had the Peter, Paul &AMP; Marys and the Josh Whites affecting it.
And you had Mongo Santamaria's `Hey Watermelon Man,' which was
really a Cuban blues, affecting it. There was never a period where
so much was going on musically.''
</P>
<P>
   Soul music, of course, borrowed from all of these _ and from the
church, where Percy Sledge got his start in tiny Leighton, Ala.,
about six miles from the famed Muscle Shoals studio where Aretha
Franklin recorded.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people say I sing like my mother,'' notes Sledge.
``We went to the Galilee Baptist Church in Leighton, a town that
had but one red light.''
</P>
<P>
   Sledge, 57, has made a career out of ``When a Man Loves a
Woman,'' a wailing, open-throated tune that he originally titled
``Why Did You Leave Me Baby.'' A disc jockey by the name of Quint
Ivy (from Sheffield, Ala.) heard Sledge sing it at a party. ``He
liked the feeling of it, but not the lyrics,'' says Sledge. ``The
lyrics didn't even rhyme. So I changed them and I put in a crying
feeling, as if everybody had left me. I just put a lot of feeling
into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Sledge sings it everywhere he goes _ from casinos in
Mississippi and Louisiana, to showcase theaters in Europe. ``You
can't give a show without giving your all,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   That's the sentiment of most of the Royal Soul Revue acts. They
know this is a ``pilot tour'' (it's been assembled by
Delsener/Slater Enterprises in New York), but they're hoping to
have more such tours in the future to spread the legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting our end ready,'' says Wolf. ``We're looking to
have a soul house party.''

CALIFORNIA LEGISLATORS CALL FOR INVESTIGATION IN HIGH GAS PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WENDY TANAKA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ California legislators Thursday asked the
state's attorney general to launch an investigation into why Bay
Area gas prices are 15 to 30 cents higher per gallon than prices in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In a 45-25 vote, the California Assembly passed a bill that
called for Attorney General Dan Lungren to look into the reasons
for the regional price differences to determine whether oil
companies and refiners are operating fairly.
</P>
<P>
   ``California has the highest gas prices in the nation,'' said
state Assemblyman Michael Sweeney, who sponsored the bill. ``And
the Bay Area has the highest gas prices in California. ... With
refineries located in our own back yard, it is difficult to
understand why our gas prices are so high compared with Los Angeles
and other parts of the state or nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles motorists pay about $1.02 per gallon, or 9 cents per
gallon less than the national average of $1.11, according to
California State Automobile Association figures. By contrast, Bay
Area gas prices range from $1.17 to $1.32 per gallon on average.
</P>
<P>
   The state's effort comes a month after San Francisco-based
Chevron Corp., the largest gasoline seller in the state, defeated
an ordinance in San Francisco that would have restricted its
control over franchisees.
</P>
<P>
   The ordinance, authored by Supervisor Michael Yaki, would have
forced oil refiners like Chevron to get out of owning gas stations
and allow franchise operators to shop around for the lowest
wholesale prices.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, franchise owners, who contract to sell major oil
company gasoline, can purchase gas only from the refiner.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many franchise owners have complained they can't
compete on price against company-owned gas stations, which can buy
gas more cheaply from refiners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's collusion. Simple,'' said Evelyn Poquez, who owns a BP
gas station franchise on Market Street. ``We are being used as a
tool to gouge customers.''
</P>
<P>
   But major oil refiners said market forces have kept gas prices
higher in the Bay Area. The Western States Petroleum Association, a
trade group representing major oil companies, said the Bay Area's
high land prices, rising gas taxes and lengthy permit processes
elevate prices at the pump.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron spokeswoman Alison Jones said the company will cooperate
with the investigation but added that previous attempts to find
wrongdoing in gas pricing came up short.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a number of these investigations into gas
pricing in California,'' she said. ``They have consistently found
that the marketplace sets gasoline prices. This will reach the same
conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill asked Lungren to submit his findings by December.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the Federal Trade Commission launched its own
investigation into the differences in gas pricing.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Yaki said the passage of the assembly bill is ``a
recognition that more and more people are beginning to understand
the gas market is being manipulated.''

HARVARD, HUEY AND THE 'HOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A real dialogue happened the other afternoon at the
Strand Theatre. Huey P. Newton stood up and shook the hand of
Julius Caesar, who had just been released from lockup.
</P>
<P>
   Say what? There is a logical explanation. It was one of those
rare moments when art and life intersect, when a simple handshake
signifies more than a thousand academic treatises.
</P>
<P>
   What happened is this. Actor Roger Guenveur Smith is in Boston
to act in ``A Huey P. Newton Story,'' his award-winning performance
piece about the late cofounder of the Black Panther Party. He
stopped by the Dorchester theater to do a meet-and-greet with the
young actors in a summer program called New Land/Scapes. Smith,
best known for his work in the films of Spike Lee, told the young
actors that theater is sacred, it's spiritual. ``I think it's
church,'' he said. ``It's where we do the undoable.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't have to convince the young actors. They know about
theater that comes from the guts; they know about the
bloodcurdling, spine-straightening drama otherwise known as real
life. For eight years, local youths have been participating in the
summer program, which is run by a visionary named Brent Blair. It
operates on a shoestring budget, and Blair usually shells out his
own money to buy dinner for the young actors. Many of the
participants hold part-time jobs and support small children at
home; others have been in and out of juvenile detention centers. In
fact, the actor playing the title role in this summer's production
of ``Julius Caesar'' was just released from lockup; he arrives at
the end of the chat session with Smith and goes up to shake the
professional actor's hand.
</P>
<P>
   It's a moment to remember. Smith, who is not usually given to
reticence, is momentarily stunned after he clasps the hand of Jason
DePina.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I say?'' he begins, after a long silence. ``I have
just been introduced to Julius Caesar who has just been released
from lock-down,'' Smith says. ``You ask what art and civic
discourse is all about, and it's about that. It's about this
moment, about this young man emerging to play the Bard.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, you see, is performing in Boston under the auspices of
the Institute on the Arts and Civic Dialogue, an ambitious project
that has brought scholars and artists together at Harvard
University for six weeks to explore the issues of our time. The
institute _ which is funded by the Ford Foundation and jointly
sponsored by Harvard's W.E.B. Du Bois Institute and the American
Repertory Theatre _ is presenting ``A Huey P. Newton Story'' as a
free performance. Smith has performed the piece all over the
country, and he says he likes to meet with young people in the
communities he visits because it provides ``a way of bringing down
that wall that traditionally divides audiences and performers.''
</P>
<P>
   There is barely a hint of a barrier between Smith and the young
adults as he sits with them in the auditorium, where a colorful
mural on the downstage wall depicts images of ``Hip Hop Boston.''
In the softest of voices, Smith tells the actors he grew up in what
he calls ``Hollywatts,'' with feet in two drastically diverse
cultures and mythologies. He recalls how he was one of hundreds of
actors auditioning for Spike Lee when he landed a role in ``School
Daze,'' how he created the stuttering character he played in ``Do
the Right Thing.'' He fields the usual kids-meet-actor questions:
How did you get your first break? What advice do you have?
</P>
<P>
   He talks about his upcoming role in Lee's ``Summer of Sam,'' the
controversial film about serial killer David Berkowitz. He touches
on his portrayal of Newton: ``It's very simple. Just one man, one
chair, and about 20 cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   The performance, which won two Obie Awards and two Drama Desk
nominations, is hardly that simple. Smith gained exclusive access
to the archives of Newton's estate, and he spent months researching
the conflicted life of the legendary Black Panther. Before he began
his studies, he had the same image most folks had of Newton: the
image from the poster showing a man in a wicker chair, spear in one
hand, gun in the other, black beret perched on his head. By the
time he got together with composer and collaborator Marc Anthony
Thompson, Smith had a more complex picture of his subject, a man
dueling with his private demons and the baggage of his public
persona.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson and Smith worked together to forge a piece that
deliberately steers clear of the traditional biodrama a la Clarence
Darrow or Emily Dickinson. Instead, they came up with a staged jazz
improvisation, where the music and the words segue in a sort of
dramatic riff. At the very beginning, they just got together and
went through all the archival material, talking and searching for
the right way to present Newton, who was murdered on the street in
1989. In a week, they patched the script together and came up with
the music. But on the eve of their first public performance in San
Francisco, they panicked. Newton's widow and several family members
were coming to the performance, and it wasn't ready. So the two
collaborators went out and talked, with Thompson asking the
questions and Smith answering in character as Newton. It clicked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The piece was never written _ it was absorbed and
regurgitated,'' Smith recalls. ``Marc Anthony just sat and asked me
questions: `What do you think of Shakespeare? What do you think of
Bob Dylan?' The result was this organic but historically informed
piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson says his music strives to evoke a mood. ``It had to
sound like a very slow burn, a controlled muscle that was just
about to break, a long, slow process as opposed to a snap,'' the
composer explains during a telephone interview from New York. ``We
wanted this cauldron of emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   A long, slow burn. It happens onstage when Smith and Thompson
perform, but it also happens in its own way at the Strand Theatre
when the actor meets with the young performers. The connection is
genuine as the young actors testify about the cruel intersection of
dreams and reality, about how they want to build careers as artists
but need to find a way to pay their bills, feed their babies.
Throughout the session, Blair, the New Land/Scapes director, does a
slow burn, and then he snaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvard is having this big conference about art and social
discourse,'' he says, ``and most of those people have never touched
a toe in this community. They want social discourse? They want a
dialogue? Tell 'em to come down here.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair is echoing the common perception among many grass-roots
arts administrators who get their hands dirty every day, living and
breathing the kinds of issues the Harvard institute was founded to
study within the confines of the ivory tower. The institute
received a $1.5 million seed grant from the Ford Foundation and has
raised more funds from the Boston Foundation and other private
sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is definitely a gulf between academia, black and white,
and the community in Boston,'' says Strand staffer Joyce Bishop.
``If they really want a dialogue, if they really want young people
to be a part of it, they have to be involved from the very
beginning and not just as an afterthought.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop and Blair are hitting on precisely the issues the
institute was founded to examine. It was initiated as a result of
the work of its director, Anna Deavere Smith, whose plays ``Fires
in the Mirror'' and ``Twilight: Los Angeles'' explore issues that
divide various communities. The program, which was announced in
November but held its first meeting 10 days ago, has been funded
for three six-week summer sessions. Deputy director Andrea L.
Taylor says the institute is designed to be both a place where
artists can incubate new ideas about art and society as well as a
springboard to take those ideas into the community. ``We are very
open, very anxious, and very eager to learn from and engage with
the greater Boston community,'' Taylor says. ``Obviously, that kind
of work takes time. We are beginning. We're grateful (for) the
response we've received, and we know we have a lot more to do.''
The institute is holding several public forums over the next few
weeks; a program held this week attracted an overflow crowd and had
to be moved to a larger venue.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Smith (no relation to Anna Deavere Smith) listens to the
administrators at the Strand and empa-thizes, although he also says
he admires the institute's attempt to mix things up, to move beyond
the traditional models prescribed in the art world. At the same
time, he raises yet another issue that might be discussed at the
institute, which gathers about 50 artists and scholars every night
to bang heads about art and social discourse. ``I'm at Harvard, but
I'm at the Dorchester extension. Simply because I happen to be
doing a solo performance about someone who happens to be
African-American who happened to cofound a political party, I find
myself being relegated to the ghetto of sociopolitical theater or
the historical pageant.'' He's speaking softly, his voice barely
audible above the clamor of young folks rehearsing in the
high-ceilinged halls of the Strand. At this precise point, the
actor playing Jul-ius Caesar appears, and that handshake happens.
Art and civic discourse? ``It's about that.''

TRICKY ON HIS OWN TERMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here was the scene at Tricky's two-hour-plus concert
at &UR;  &LR; Boston's Avalon last year: He stood, virtually immobile, in
near darkness, rapping as his mates played. It was jam time with a
lot of downtime _ languid, ambient grooves, cut with deep bass
lines, spiked sporadically with disorienting, mind-scrambling
sounds, both sampled and live. There were no big flashy pop hooks.
It was tense, claustrophobic. You got the sense Tricky was
burrowing deeper and deeper into a dark world. He was not singing
about peace and love. He glimpsed the future and it was both
insular and apocalyptic.
</P>
<P>
   Says Tricky, on the phone from his New York home, of his
performance style: ``We're not gonna go and shake our (butts) ...
for you. You've got to give something as well.'' He recently told
Musician magazine something similar, adding, ``I'm no one's dancing
monkey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what artists have become,'' says the British trip-hop
artist. ``All these hip-hop artists and R&AMP;B artists and all these
Alanis Morissettes _ they're really like performing monkeys.
Rec-ord companies have reduced artists to dancing minstrels.''
</P>
<P>
   Some hip-hop artists ``say my music is weird,'' he adds. ``(I
think) it's harder than any of their music. If you want to hear
hardcore music, I've got some hardcore for you. Hardcore is
confused with gangs and guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Tricky addresses these issues in song as well on his latest CD,
his third, ``Angels With Dirty Faces.'' On the melancholic
``Demise,'' Tricky rap-sings, ``I'm too scared to be a gun-toting
gangsta wan-na-be.''
</P>
<P>
   `You can get killed in that world,'' he explains in his raspy
staccato voice and a British accent.
</P>
<P>
   For the cut ``Rec-ord Companies,'' he has the late Biggie Smalls
and Tupac Shakur shaking hands in heaven while the violent
rap-warrior games go on below.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm, like, trying to open people's brains a bit,'' he says.  &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tricky, 29, wants to succeed on his own terms. He admits that
his music is not, on the surface, commercially accessible: ``But I
think it will be one day, (although) that would be purely
accidental.''
</P>
<P>
   One of trip-hop's originators, Tricky is famous in his native
country, England _ ``top of the heap,'' as he says,
matter-of-factly. Tricky once worked with the guys who went on to
form Massive Attack. Three years ago, he emerged alongside that
band and Portishead as trip-hop entered the fringes of the
mainstream. His debut, ``Maxinquaye,'' was a worldwide smash,
selling more than 500,000 copies. It was a moody, mostly mellow
affair. Some mistook it to be sophisticated cocktail music, much to
Tricky's chagrin.
</P>
<P>
   He took it upon himself to push the envelope more since he's not
exactly a fan of most pop or hip-hop. ``Taking somebody's piece of
music and putting some crap lyrics on it with a chorus,'' he says,
dismissively.
</P>
<P>
   He has worked with artists ranging from Bjork to Bush to Elvis
Costello to PJ Harvey, who joins Tricky on the soulful ``Broken
Homes,'' the upcoming single. Tricky, whose real name is Adrian
Thaws, often works in tandem with soulful vocalist Martina
Topley-Bird, the mother of their young child. (The two are no
longer romantically involved.) She sings, he says, what he cannot.
Not only is he not a singer, he says, ``I'm not a musician.''
</P>
<P>
   That statement is not meant as an inverse-credibility boast or a
self-dis. He'll pen the lyrics, hum a bass line or a string part to
musicians, and work with it on his synth. ``Even if I don't use it,
it'll be the basis to write the song,'' Tricky says.
</P>
<P>
   He has no compunction about bluntly evaluating his status in the
States, where he's lived for three years. ``Here, I'm not at all
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   That's partially why he crossed the Atlantic, to work the turf.
``I got to work; I want different things now; I want to be in the
American charts. It doesn't come easy. There's more to aim for here
and I could do more damage, especially in places like hip-hop and
pop music.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He tells us the new album is his first to chart in this country,
but his debut, ``Maxinquaye,'' charted as well. The new one has
reached a high point, so far, of 84.
</P>
<P>
   Tricky left the quietude of ``Maxinquaye'' behind with his
second disc, the much edgier ``Pre-Millennium Tension.'' ``Angels
With Dirty Faces'' is less agitated, but there is a familiar
entrancing soundscape: one that ebbs and flows, but is cut with
fractured jungle beats. Tricky touches base with gospel, blues, and
jazz, but he likes the idea of surprise, of disorientation. The
studio is his palette. The album has received mostly raves from
critics, though Tricky notes that it takes time to absorb and ``a
couple of press people in England'' have slammed it. You've got to
listen to it. It's not a halfway thing where people can lock right
into it. This is very personal. It's like I'm trying to talk to
people.''
</P>
<P>
   What's he saying?
</P>
<P>
   He's talking about power and its corrupting influence, about
avaricious media, about the once-popular and now-dead, about the
violence that's in the air. He's got a sweet song about his
daughter, ``Carriage for Two,'' but, mostly, his visions are dark.
He'll agree that paranoia is part of the mix. ``The energy I
receive, I give back.''
</P>
<P>
   Tricky, who is far from morose, says he is not a worrier. ``No,
no, no, not at all,'' he says. The world of conflict he writes
about, he says, is often drawn from the images on TV, the news, and
movies, where humans usually have no more value than ants.
</P>
<P>
   Tricky likes the music he's done, but it is, well, done. He'd
rather discuss what lies ahead, today. ``We've just done some new
music and it's less tense, less claustrophobic,'' Tricky says. ``I
had a bit of a time not knowing where I'm going, what I want to do,
but I know what I need now. I'm more chilled to myself, more
relaxed. I think I've developed a conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   He's just completed one track, ``Bleeding.'' Sounds like a sunny
romp through a field of flowers, right? ``It sounds dark,'' he
admits, with a laugh, ``but it's really positive, the most positive
thing I've ever written. People could sing along to it. It's crazy,
yeah, almost like Oasis. I'm not even an Oasis fan, but it reminded
me of Oasis, kind of. I know, it sounds crazy, right?''

HEN FRIGATES 
Wives of Merchant Captains Under Sail 
By Joan Druett 
Simon &AMP; Schuster, 274 pp., Illustrated, $25 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In researching ``Hen Frigates,'' an altogether fascinating
account of the joys and perils of the women who sailed with their
19th-century ship-captain husbands, maritime historian Joan Druett
drew upon 143 of their diaries, journals, and published
reminiscences.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that Druett, a New Zealander, found all but a few of
these accounts in libraries and historical society archives in New
England and on Long Island, that number suggests the richness of
material in this region for the historian. More significant,
perhaps, given that the preserved written records must represent a
minority of all who sailed, this suggests what a large number of
women, she writes, ``took up the strange existence in the
blue-water trade, surviving storms, visiting exotic ports, giving
birth at sea, raising children on shipboard and socializing with
other wives at scarce intervals.''
</P>
<P>
   As the sketchy biographical information about these women
indicates, ``these were ordinary, conservative, middle-class women,
certainly not rebels or adventurers.''
</P>
<P>
   There was, as Druett explains, a good reason why so many women
went to sea with their husbands _ the first voyage often being
their honeymoon. A ship captain, especially on a smaller coastal
schooner, most likely had ``invested a substantial sum of his own
money in the ship ... and could not afford to buy a house on
land.'' Besides, ``returning home to live with relatives might not
seem a pleasant option, after the excitement of the wedding.''

   Among the accounts Druett draws on is a classic honeymoon voyage
taken by Susan Hathorn of Richmond, Maine, whose diary was the
basis of a book published last year as ``A Bride's Passage.'' There
were many like her _ such as Georgia Maria Gilkey of Searsport,
Maine, who in 1906 ``was married in her graduation dress, there
(having been) no time to make a wedding gown.'' They married a week
after Captain Phineas Banning Blanchard ``proposed to her during
one of his fleeting trips home.'' And ``after a hasty buffet
luncheon,'' they took the train to Philadelphia, where Blanchard's
square-rigger Bangalore was loading coal for a voyage around Cape
Horn to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other seagoing wives, Georgia Blanchard became a
skilled navigator. She recalled that she ``started right off
working the sights (i.e., sextant readings) each day and marking
them on my chart.''
</P>
<P>
   Captain Alonzo Follansbee of the ship Logan knew how important a
skill that could be (although, Druett writes, he sometimes treated
his new bride as ``a rather witless child''), telling his wife that
knowledge of navigation and signal codes could make the difference
between life and death. ``All this and 10 times more, I have to
learn,'' she wrote in her journal, ``in case it should fall to my
lot to take charge of the ship.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the ship Templar, the captain's daughter,
15-year-old Emma Armstrong, had to take charge after her father was
stricken with yellow fever (her mother having died a few days
before) on a passage from New York to San Francisco in 1879. ``She
assumed charge,'' Druett writes, ``finding their position every
noon and directing the few fit seamen in the setting of sails'' _
even though she was so sick herself ``that she had to be carried up
on deck in a litter to take her sights and issue directions.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was also time for romance in these ``hen frigates.''
On board the whaler Lucy Ann in 1847, Martha Brown, the captain's
wife, wrote in her journal that ``if quince groves and moonlight
nights are incentives to make love, surely moonlight nights on
shipboard are doubly so.'' And, ``naturally enough,'' Druett
reports, she became pregnant during the voyage but was set ashore
in Honolulu rather than giving birth on board, as was the case with
many other seagoing wives.
</P>
<P>
   The title ``Hen Frigates'' comes from the common term for a ship
whose captain had his wife on board.
</P>
<P>
   The examples of its use cited in the Random House Historical
Dictionary of American Slang all have the connotation of
``henpecked'' _ as in the 1867 ``Sailor's Word Book,'' which
defines a ``hen frigate'' as ``a ship wherein the captain's wife
interfered in the duty or regulations.'' But seen through Druett's
lively and sometimes poignant accounts, the word that comes to mind
to describe the women is that somewhat old-fashioned one:
``spunky.''

   KIBBUTZ GEZER, Israel _ Set in the golden fields of the Ayalon
Valley, this kibbutz at first glance presents a vision of the early
Zionist ideal of working the land. Dairy cows moo in faded old
barns and tractors rumble up a hillside with a load of watermelons
from the fertile valley.
</P>
<P>
   But in a small office in the back of an old dining hall, the
future for this kibbutz and for all of Israel's economy can be
heard in the clicking of computer keyboards in the collective's new
internet service provider company called ``Gezernet.''
</P>
<P>
   Gezer's prize dairy herd may still be the bread and butter of
the kibbutz's annual budget, but its two-year-old venture into the
world of high tech is its promise for the future. It also is a
symbol for Israel's changing economy.
</P>
<P>
   As Israel celebrates its 50th anniversary of statehood this
year, it is in the process of a dramatic transformation from its
beginnings, which stressed agriculture and manufacturing, to a new
kind of technological pioneering that will take it into the next
century. Agriculture, which for decades was Israel's major source
of export earnings, now accounts for only 3 pecent of all exports.
Israel is now in fact a net importer of food.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is fast on its way to carving out a niche for itself in
the global economy as ``Silicon Valley East.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an evolution, not a revolution,'' says Israeli Finance
Minister Yaakov Neeman. ``Fifty years ago, the kibbutzniks were the
pioneers in this country. They were young and ambitious and
idealistic. And now this spirit will be in the field of high
technology. Young engineers and programmers will be the new
pioneers of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Partly because Israel has relied for so long on billions of
dollars each year in American aid, it is difficult to analyze the
country's economic success. Still, its achievements over 50 years
are considerable.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the continuing heavy burden of defense spending in this
volatile region, economic modernization has raised Israel's Gross
Domestic Product to almost $17,000 per person. That far exceeds the
GDP per person in neighboring countries such as the much more
highly populated Egypt, also a major recipient of American aid,
which still struggles in poverty at roughly $2,900 GDP per person.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's growth since the 1991 Gulf War and the onset of the
historic 1993 Israeli-Palestinian peace accords has been
impressive. However, the current deadlock in the peace process
could, if it continues indefinitely, dash the hopes of Israel's new
economy. The lifeless peace process already is beginning to hurt
the economy, according to some analysts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Israel's GDP was about $50 billion and $10 billion in
US loan guarantees were needed to finance Jewish emigration from
the former Soviet Union. Today, Israel's GDP is more than $100
billion.
</P>
<P>
   High tech is largely responsible for the growth, economic
analysts say. Israel's 50 largest high tech businesses generate
about $20 billion a year for the economy and now employ an
estimated 70,000 people. And since 1991, Israel has started some
3,000 high tech companies, the greatest number of high tech
startups in any country except the United States. About half of the
companies have survived and employ 150,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is making its mark mostly in the area of security and
telecommunications software. A company known as CheckPoint
Software, for example, has cornered the market on a service that
protects computer systems from viruses and hackers. The mix of a
growing entrepreneurial culture, a highly educated work force and
an extensive research and development infrastructure has also
attracted many multinationals to Israel, including Intel, IBM and
Digital.
</P>
<P>
   Helping pave the way for Israel's success is the opening of the
economy through privatization. It is a process that has evolved
since Israel's economic crisis in the mid-1980s but Netanyahu's
government has been more focused than his predecessors on breaking
up powerful, state-run businesses, such as the banking and
transportation industries.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation of the unwieldly and largely inefficient
public service sector still has a long way to go, according to
Yakov Frankel, chairman of the Bank of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between the first 50 years and the next 50
years will be shifting the economy away from government control. It
is the only way we will be able to lower the tax burden and create
a free market,'' says Frankel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many people who look at our successes, and say we
have to give ourselves time. But the hard truth is there is no
time. We are very late in entering the global market,'' adds
Frankel.
</P>
<P>
   To Neeman, there is no better illustration of the pioneering
spirit in Israel's opening economy than the story of Mirabilis Ldt.
The small Israeli software company was started by three Israelis in
their early 20s who traveled to California's Silicon Valley, saw
what was going on and brought that back to Israel, joining the pool
of 3,000 startup high tech companies. The difference between theirs
and the others is that they made it. Mirabilis, which had an
investment of $2 million by its owners, Neeman loves to point out,
was bought by America On Line Inc. on June 8 for $287 million in
cash. In 2001 AOL will make addition payments of $120 million based
on performance.
</P>
<P>
   The company makes downloadable software for chatting on the
Internet in real time. Although the firm does no marketing or
advertising, 13 million people have downloaded its software.
</P>
<P>
   But Israel should not be so quick to pat itself on the back,
some analysts caution. Despite the high tech fairy tales that have
made a few people fabulously rich, Israel is still lagging behind
the top performers in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   Lester Thurow, the MIT economist, is chairman of a program
called Technion Institute of Management in Tel Aviv that provides
advanced management training to Israel's high tech executives.
Thurow is a friend of Israel, but very tough on its economy.

SEVEN YEARS LATER, BANK OF N.E. CREDITORS FIGHT ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It's been seven years since the disasterous collapse of
Bank of New England, a painful but increasingly distant memory to
thousands of businesses and people who have moved on.
</P>
<P>
   That would not include Ben Branch.
</P>
<P>
   Branch is the trustee of Bank of New England's bankruptcy
estate, which has spent the seven years and about $40 million
trying to collect money and pursue claims on behalf of creditors,
mostly investors who were stuck holding about $700 million in bank
bonds when regulators seized the institution Jan. 6, 1991.
</P>
<P>
   He's still working at it and estimates that, at best, the job
could take a couple more years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven years is a long time,'' said Branch, a finance professor
at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. ``I'm not looking to
drag it out; I'd like to be done with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Branch works in a small warren of offices over a
restaurant near Faneuil Hall, just a couple of blocks from Bank of
New England's old headquarters building on State Street.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 thick blue binders filled with bankruptcy
documents line the office entrance. Two paralegals, an office
manager and one clerical worker make up the trustee's staff.
</P>
<P>
   Branch took a leave of absence from UMass for a year when he was
first appointed the Bank of New England trustee. He has gradually
scaled back his trustee work and now comes to Boston one day per
week to work on the case.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the bank estate's $40 million in expenses and most
of Branch's time has been dedicated to a civil suit in US District
Court in Boston against the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
</P>
<P>
   At issue: more than $200 million Branch says belongs to company
creditors but instead fell into the hands of the FDIC. The FDIC,
the federal regulatory agency that shut the bank, denies it owes
any money.
</P>
<P>
   Creditors concede they are frustrated the estate has moved so
slowly, but generally blame the FDIC for dragging its feet in
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have died along the way,'' said Gary Himber, a
securities broker in New Jersey who is chairman of the Bank of New
England creditors' committee. ``A lot of them are old. Seven years
is a long time when you're 80 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Bank of New England was the second-largest banking company in
the region when it was pulled under by a huge portfolio of bad
loans, mostly backed by real estate. Dozens of New England banks
failed during that period, but none packed the painful financial
punch of the failure at Bank of New England. The company's banks
were later put up for bid by regulators in an auction won by Fleet
Financial Group.
</P>
<P>
   Just months ago, Bank of New England creditors received their
first payment of any kind, a $40 million interim distribution of
money the estate held from the beginning or acquired in other
settlements. Holders of senior bonds, who were on top of the
repayment pecking order, received about 15 cents on the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The payout, however, was roughly equal to the money spent by the
bank estate since 1991. About half that sum has been paid to
lawyers at Andrews &AMP; Kurth, hired by Branch to sue the FDIC and
pursue other cases for the bank estate. The Houston firm has
extensive experience battling with the FDIC over cases spawned by
the Texas banking collapse of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Branch has sued many parties as trustee, including former Bank
of New England directors and officers, as well as the public
accounting firm that worked for the bank.
</P>
<P>
   But the case against the FDIC has been by far the most
contentious and time consuming. Challenges of all kinds litter the
history of the case, questioning everything from the validity of
expert witnesses and their conclusions to the right to a jury
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things drag on, and they fight you every step of the
way,'' said Himber, the head of the creditors committee.
</P>
<P>
   After seven years and a trial date finally in sight, both sides
asked a bankruptcy judge last week for permission to take the
matter to private mediation. A session with a mediator, New York
attorney Conrad K. Harper, has been tentatively scheduled for Aug.
31.
</P>
<P>
   In a twist, the FDIC is also a creditor of the bank's estate and
occasionally takes advantage of its right to challenge specific
expenses paid by Branch in his legal pursuit of the regulators.
``It is unusual,'' concedes attorney Deborah Griffin of Peabody &AMP;
Arnold, who represents the FDIC.
</P>
<P>
   The case centers on a dispute over when Bank of New England
actually became insolvent and the movement of cash within the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of New England Corp., which issued stock and bonds, was a
holding company that technically owned its banks as subsidiaries.
Before it failed, the holding company had issued a new, $200
million round of bonds in late 1989 and promptly sent the money to
its banks.
</P>
<P>
   Once the money was moved to the banks, it fell beyond the legal
grasp of bondholders and into the hands of the FDIC for good.
</P>
<P>
   But Branch argues that Bank of New England was insolvent before
the last bond issue and well before regulators actually seized the
banks. Based on that claim, he argues the bond money should have
never been sent to the banks.
</P>
<P>
   Consultants for Branch and the FDIC have generated dueling tomes
that measure the company's weak financial pulse in its last years
and come to predictably different conclusions on when insolvency
technically occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you've got an outrage perpetrated on the investing
public,'' said Julian Hertz of Larchmont, N.Y., a former criminal
court judge in New York City who bought Bank of New England bonds
on the cheap in 1990 when the company was known to be struggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``While they were down in value, we paid considerable amounts
for these bonds. They were purchased with the thinking that this
thing was on the level,'' said Hertz.
</P>
<P>
   The prospects for repayment to creditors may be reflected in the
current prices of Bank of New England's bonds, which still trade
sporadically.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of New England Corp. issued both senior and junior bonds.
The senior bonds are more valuable because they must be paid off in
full before junior bondholders get any of their money back.
</P>
<P>
   The senior bonds trade for roughly 33 cents on the dollar,
according to Himber. The junior bonds trade for less than a penny
on the dollar. Himber said Bank of New England subordinated bonds
with a face value of $1 million can sometimes be purchased for
about $7,500.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the estate's work grinds on. Branch believes he will
get closer to his goal of closing the bankruptcy file a settlement
is reached with the FDIC and the bank's auditors, who are being
sued in a separate case.
</P>
<P>
   ``If those get resolved, everything will fall in place fairly
quickly,'' he said. At this pace, that means a few more years.

FAMILIAR FACES, NEW ROLES FOR JONES, DEL VALLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Derrick ``Smoke'' Gainer probably knows Roy Jones Jr.
as well as anyone in boxing and he has a suggestion for World
Boxing Association light heavyweight champion Lou Del Valle.
</P>
<P>
   Leave Roy alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're better off if you don't get his attention,'' Gainer
said this week, which may be sound advice but not something Del
Valle will be likely to follow Saturday night, although it might
still be sound advice if he could.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Del Valle is that in 24 hours he will face Jones
in a boxing ring at the Theatre at Madison Square Garden and try to
add Jones's World Boxing Council version of the 175-pound title to
the WBA belt he presently owns. The likelihood of this happening is
roughly akin to the fight being snowed out.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Del Valle says he doesn't believe it will be as
difficult to hit the seemingly unhittable Jones as people keep
saying because he's hit him before. Jones, meanwhile, has grown
exasperated by his former sparring partner's confidence in the face
of what Jones sees as the inevitable _ which is an early night _
and so he has become peeved, a state of mind Smoke Gainer believes
is not a good sign for Del Valle.
</P>
<P>
   Gainer may have a point but Del Valle insists he's hoping the
ire he has caused will inspire Jones to come after him the way he
went after his last two opponents _ Montell Griffin and Virgil
Hill. Why he thinks this is a good idea in the face of the fact
Griffin was KO'd in one round and Hill in four is difficult for
some to fathom but it makes perfect sense to Del Valle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the style to beat Roy Jones,'' Del Valle (27-1, 19 KOs)
said this week. ``I've never seen him hit on the chin. He's gonna
get hit if he comes out after me the way he did Montell and Virgil
because I'm the best counterpuncher in boxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gonna be hard for him to lead with his left hook. If he
does, I'll counter with my left. I feel he's going to come out real
hard like he did in the second Montell fight. He's going to put
pressure on and I believe he's going to get himself in trouble
doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   By the standards of Jones's most recent opponents, these are
bold words but Del Valle will tell you they come from experience _
the 38 rounds he spent sparring with Jones for $750 a week in 1995
when Jones was preparing to fight another southpaw, Antoine Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   Del Valle says he more than held his own during those sessions
which is more than Byrd can claim since he, too, was knocked out in
one round.
</P>
<P>
   ``His camp knows I held my own,'' Del Valle said.
</P>
<P>
   What Del Valle believes is that the fact he's been in with Jones
for 38 rounds gives him an edge over the 36 guys the WBC champion
has already beaten (31 of them by knockout). Jones nods in assent.
</P>
<P>
   What Del Valle also believes is that the fact he's been in with
Jones for 38 rounds allows him to understand the WBC champion's
weaknesses _ such as they may be _ and more importantly allows him
to understand Jones's approach in a fight. To this, Jones nods in
assent but less enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, Del Valle says Jones is a counterpuncher, same as he is,
which could make for a slow night unless Jones (36-1) opts to
ignore his normal style and attack. To this, Jones says nothing
except this rather menacing statement:
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he wanted Roy Jones. Now he's got Roy Jones. But
what's he going to do with him?''
</P>
<P>
   If you believe Del Valle, he's going to move, counterpunch, and
wait for the chance to shock the world.
</P>
<P>
   If you believe Jones's stablemate, Smoke Gainer, he's going to
ignore some good advice and get himself in a heap of trouble before
he ends up in a heap at Jones's feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a good counterpuncher,'' Jones conceded. ``He is left
handed and he is a good defensive fighter. I'll give him all that.
But he got nothing to keep me off him. He says he learned a lot
from sparring with me. If he did, now he knows what he has to run
from.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like Roy Jones Jr. believes his old sparring partner
should have taken his old friend's advice.

<P>
   ``To be honest, I would love to,'' he says. ``But sometimes I
have doubts. Right now with the comments being made, well, I don't
like comments being made, know what I'm saying? Right now, I'm an
All-Star at this level. And I want to be treated like that. You
work hard to get at a certain level, you want to maintain that
level. And I can't maintain it like this when my coach isn't behind
me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of this negative publicity that's been getting in
the paper. They say, ``We didn't say it like this; we didn't word
it like that.' Why not just: `No comment'?''
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot unsaid in the Walker pauses. He remembers all
slights and perceived shuns. For all the Walker Wiggles and
technicals and scowls, Walker is described as a soft-spoken man who
craves the every-other-week, Sunday through Friday sessions he has
with his 4-year-old daughter, Crystal.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's built just like 'Toine,'' laughs Dennis Smith, a friend
of Walker's. ``She's knock-kneed and everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker remembers not receiving the Catholic League MVP at Mount
Carmel, an award that went to a rival player named Jerry Gee, who
played at Illinois. He remembers the taunts from fans, people
chastising him for showing off, people saying he couldn't read.
``And these were adults,'' said Mike Curta, Walker's high school
coach. He remembers not getting consideration for Rookie of the
Year. He remembers Grizzlies general manager Stu Jackson telling
him that he couldn't pick him third in the 1996 draft because he
wasn't projected that high. He remembers last month, how he wanted
the Celtics to draft forward-center Mohammed and how they wound up
with guard-forward Paul Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pierce is a good player,'' Walker says. ``He's a guy who can
come off the bench and give scoring to our second unit. But I know
our team needs. We need big people.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoa. Pierce off the bench? How about Pierce starting?
</P>
<P>
   ``It could happen,'' Walker said. `` ... But I don't see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker is a sensitive man. So if the Celtics choose to wait and
see how he performs in 1998-99 without first signing him to a
contract extension ...
</P>
<P>
   ``If that happens, I won't re-sign. That's a guarantee. If the
lockout works out where I can sign this year and they don't sign me
to an extension, I will not come back. If they don't sign me? I'm
gone. That's not showing loyalty to me. It shouldn't be a question.
If that happens, no matter what I do (in '98-99) I'm gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four hours after her son says this, Diane Walker _ often
mistaken as a 20-something sister of Walker's _ will be wearing a
Celtics T-shirt. She knows her son is a pro star. In Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to win, man,'' he says. ``I'd like to stay in Boston.
The fans are excellent. It's a great place to play. It would be
weird to go into a new city and establish a new identity when I
already have one there. But I know I was on the trading block. I
guess that's business because maybe the Celtics could get three
players for me or something.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is an echo in this room, with its exposed brick walls
and hardwood floors. The topic echoes, too, going all the way back
to the summer camp Walker did not attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you,'' he says, ``no veteran, All-Star player
shows up for a camp like that. For the rest of my career, I'll
never go to a camp like that. Never.''
</P>
<P>
   The camp that Walker doesn't believe is a waste of time takes
place at his old high school. Walker is here, sitting at a table in
a noisy Student Center. He is eating pizza and watching a tape from
1994 when a skinny high schooler in a brown and white jersey _
No.23 _ is on his way to a 35-point night.
</P>
<P>
   Here, all Walker has to do is make sure he is around for the
children, his brothers and sisters among them. A few campers watch
as a team led by Walker and Donovan McNabb take on Miles Simon's
team. Some of Walker's friends have volunteered as coaches and
referees. They tease him as he watches the tape. ``That was a nice
move,'' Eugene McIntosh says, ``but on the next trip down, you're
shooting air, baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost. Two possessions later, a confident Walker pulls up and
releases an airball. The children laugh. Walker does, too. You can
see hints of his game, then: the swagger, the ballhandling, the
emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's quiet off the court,'' Diane Walker says. ``On the court
is the only time he really shows a lot of emotion. It's something
he loves to do. A lot of people misread his facial expressions. I
understand that because people do the same thing with me.''
</P>
<P>
   But 20,000 people in NBA arenas have never watched Diane Walker
do the Walker Wiggle. She hasn't been whistled for 30 technicals in
two seasons. She has not been accused of being, ``the most hated
player in the NBA.'' The children here would disagree with that. So
would Walker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm the most loved player in the NBA,'' he says,
smiling. ``Really, people in the NBA love each other. No one in the
NBA really hates someone else. Maybe there was something extra in
the Larry Johnson-Alonzo Mourning fight, something that went beyond
the court. But most guys love each other. We're playing in the best
league in the world and many of us are millionaires; why would you
hate anybody?''
</P>
<P>
   Hall adds of the on-court Walker, ``Once you open your mouth
you've got to do something. A quiet person can get away with
playing bad and delivering nothing. But a vocal person has to
accept the criticism. When Antoine is on the court, he's
mean-spirited. When he steps out, he's a human being like anyone
else. He has compassion; he has concern for the youth.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall points to a gym full of smiling children. ``This is like
wanting the ball right here,'' he says. ``Creating a camp for the
kids. Giving them an opportunity to mingle with him, learn a few
fundamentals and have fun. He wants the ball. He's stepping up. Off
the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker will leave today for Miami where he will play in
Mourning's charity game. At the end of this month, he'll go to LA
and play in Magic Johnson's game. At some point, he will have to
sit down and think about his future, a future that goes beyond a
free camp at Mount Carmel High.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I'm going to do and I don't know what the
Celtics want to do,'' he said. ``I'm not saying I'm trying to break
the bank; I don't know what I'm looking for (in terms of a
contract). But I have a lot to think about. Right now I'm at the
point where I need to get to the next level. And that means making
the playoffs and winning a championship. I have to look at all my
options. I want to win. And I have to look at what (the Celtics)
do. Hey, we could finish 36-46 again. That's something I have to
think about.''
</P>
<P>
   When Walker's camp is over, he walks toward his car and heads
for Lakeshore Drive. He has said a lot about Pitino, about the
options he has to explore and about the Celtics' loyalty to him. He
has also made one revealing comment:
</P>
<P>
   He wants to have this camp again. Next year. In Boston.

MARV ALBERT'S BACK, BUT SHOULD HE BE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Yesssss, Marv Albert is back in the broadcast
business.
</P>
<P>
   If the reunion of Albert and Madison Square Garden surprises
you, if it outrages you in the least, then you need a refresher
course in the facts of life.
</P>
<P>
   Has the man no shame? Of course he has no shame. Shame in the
1990s lasts about as long as a keg of beer at a Friday night
fraternity party.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 10 months have passed since Albert pulled a courtroom
version of Roberto Duran's no mas. Albert stopped charges that he
committed forcible sodomy on his longtime lover from reaching a
jury by abruptly pleading guilty to having more hair on his palms
than on his head.
</P>
<P>
   The legal term is misdemeanor assault. A concurrent trial in the
court of public opinion resulted in convictions on the charges of
impersonating Corporal Klinger, soliciting three-way sex, planting
the idea of biting someone in Mike Tyson's head and possessing the
worst hairpiece this side of Sam Donaldson. The sentence: an
indefinite revocation of his alphabet soup privileges.
</P>
<P>
   NBC fired Albert from his job announcing NBA and NFL games. MSG
allowed Albert to resign from his job calling Knicks games. The
return of Albert to MSG is merely the continuation of the cycle of
life for the rich, famous and scandalous.
</P>
<P>
   Make trouble. Issue an insincere apology. Lie low. Rehearse
saying what people want to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I did was wrong,'' Albert said, an admission he wasn't
willing to make publicly last year. ``I hurt many people, including
my fiancee, my family, my friends and my employers. For that, I am
sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   The time for Albert to be sorry was a year ago. If Albert had
shown some contrition then, if he hadn't tried to bluff his way
through the accusations of his former lover of 10 years, then he
wouldn't have become the bite stuff for standup comics across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the guilty plea, Albert insisted any guilt on his
part was a legal technicality. When Albert made the Barbara Walters
circuit last November, he further enraged women's groups by playing
the blame-the-victim game. It's a little late now to believe Albert
is sorry for anything but the disruption to his life.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the National Organization for Women should resist getting
in a hissing match with Albert. Like it or not, Albert has every
right to go back to work for any employer who wants him.
Ultimately, it's up to the public to decide the price Albert should
pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that I get a second chance from viewers,'' Albert
said. ``Just look at the product on the air and make judgments from
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wishful thinking. Even if Albert were to discover the cure for
cancer, it would be hard to push aside the picture painted by a
former Hyatt hotel executive who testified that in 1994 Albert
summoned her to his room for assistance. According to the woman,
Albert greeted her wearing panties and a garter belt and tried to
force her to perform oral sex on him. She said she ripped off his
toupee and fled from him.
</P>
<P>
   At the trial, defense attorney Roy Black made the mistake of
suggesting the story _ even the detail about the hairpiece _ had
been conconcted from media reports. The woman testified that she
had known for years that Albert wore a toupee, prompting Black to
ask, ``Because you read it in the press?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can look at it and see,'' Masden said. ``Yeah, it's very
apparent that he wears a toupee.''
</P>
<P>
   Laughter rocked the courtroom. Can people take Albert seriously
after that? Will it hurt anything but his feelings if they don't?
He's just an announcer, not a doctor or school teacher. He's going
to do Knicks games on radio and half-hour roundup shows on
television.
</P>
<P>
   As long as there is a place in radio for G. Gordon Liddy and in
television for Jerry Springer, then surely there is an audience out
there for Marv Albert.

IS THE AMERICA'S CUP SAILING BACK? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ They are getting ready to celebrate in the
streets of this old port, getting ready for a wild homecoming
party.
</P>
<P>
   After 17 long and lonely years, the America's Cup will be coming
home, back to its rightful owners, to the city that loved it and
lost it.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's the scenario, anyway. Maybe it's a bit premature to
put the Moet on ice.
</P>
<P>
   But this summer in Newport, as the New York Yacht Club prepares
its assault on New Zealand _ current holders of the Cup _ there is
a growing sense of ... well, maybe it could happen. The fact is
that the next America's Cup race in 1999/2000 is the first chance
the New Yorkers will have had in 14 years to win back the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Young America, the NYYC America's Cup syndicate,
launched its newest boat, ``Spirit of Rhode Island'' from its
Quonset Point Sail Center for summer training in Narragansett Bay.
</P>
<P>
   As International America's Cup Class No. 39 prepared to sail,
Marilyn Almond, wife of Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Almond,
christened the boat and the New Yorker's $40 million campaign to
win back the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   In nearby Bristol, boatbuilder Eric Goetz has been commissioned
to build two boats for Young America.
</P>
<P>
   In what is called the ``modern era'' of America's Cup racing,
Newport became synonymous with a spectacle that dominated the life
of the city every two to three years, and featured such yachting
luminaries as Bus Mosbacher, Ted Turner, Tom Blackaller, and Dennis
Conner. For 25 years the 12-meter class was used in Newport, a less
expensive alternative to the huge J-boats that were sailed up to
1937 when war interrupted the Cup races.
</P>
<P>
   And as the event grew in stature throughout the modern era,
Newport grew from a down-at-the-heels Navy town to a summer
playground with nearly the opulence of the early Cup days. Though
there was never much sailing contest (the Americans ``waived the
rules and ruled the waves'') from the mid-70s to 1983, Newport and
the America's Cup was a waterfront happening that commanded
international attention.
</P>
<P>
   From some points of view, Sept. 26, 1983 was a disaster. But it
was hard to find many Americans on the Newport waterfront who were
not rooting for the upstart Australian team with its breakthrough
design and focused veteran sailing team.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Aussie teams of Frank Packer and Alan Bond
brought huge amounts of good cheer and fun to the America's Cup,
but by 1983 they were not to be distracted by the hilarity of
Newport's party life. From mid-July in the trials, everyone knew
that Australia II was the fastest Twelve on the waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   But the Australians winning the Cup was far from inevitable. In
the final series a number of breakdowns had the Australians behind
Dennis Conner's Liberty team, 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   And there's scarcely a Cup fan alive who doesn't remember that
last race on Rhode Island Sound packed with thousands of spectators
who seemed to anticipate the huge change of course that was about
to befall Newport.
</P>
<P>
   For four of six legs, Conner led the Aussies, but as the air
went light on that fateful downwind leg 5, John Bertrand sailed
Australia II past Liberty for a lead the Aussies managed to hold up
the final beat. After 132 years, a foreign challenger had won the
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   That night the lid came off the town. An estimated half million
fans pushed to get near the waterfront, and the champagne-soaked
bash went through the evening in what most natives say was the
wildest party Newport ever threw or witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   In the sober dawn, with their historic Cup pedestal now bare,
members of the New York Yacht Club shrank from the intensely
quarrelsome summer, and all but lost interest in the Cup. A new
generation of New Yorkers mounted a challenge in 1987 in Fremantle,
Australia, but the flawed campaign never came close, and Dennis
Conner took the Cup back to his home club in San Diego. It was the
last shot for Newport.
</P>
<P>
   Until now.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, of course, John Marshall, who is president of Young
America, is not thinking victory parties yet. With six US teams and
16 total challengers, predictions are a bit premature.
</P>
<P>
   But as his two training boats sail their seven-day program off
Newport this summer, Marshall is aware of the growing buzz of
anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be sailing our first real America's Cup race in October
of '99,'' says Marshall, who ran the design team that built the
victorious Stars &AMP; Stripes for Conner in '87. ``That's not a very
long time.''
</P>
<P>
   With two boats training and another two coming from Goetz
(builder of Bill Koch's Cup winner), Marshall says he is pleased
with the progress, and also the reception from the East Coast
backers and fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been able to stay focused on what we need to do to
bring the Cup back,'' says Marshall, whose start-up Young America
program had just one boat to work with in 1995. ``There's a feeling
around here of `We've got a home team, let's support them.'''

 KIBBUTZ GEZER, Israel: ... on its economy.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The statistics are a lot of hype. The fact is Israel is not
doing as well as it should be,'' Thurow said on a tour of the
country this month. ``Israel is not a miracle. There is no country
in the world with education levels as high as Israel that has such
a low per capita income.''
</P>
<P>
   Thurow compares Israel to Singapore. In 1965, Israel had 10
times the per capita income of Singapore. Today, Singapore has two
times the per capita income of Israel, even though Israel remains a
far more educated country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why? Well, as Israel has found out, if you take all your
talent and put it in the military, you hurt your economy. If you
don't have peace and stable trading partners, you hurt your
economy,'' Thurow explains.
</P>
<P>
   Israel today is like New England in the late 1960s, Thurow adds.
Back then there were dying industrial towns in Lowell and Lawrence
and there was a new road called Route 128 with new companies. But
they were very small. Today, New England seems to have successfuly,
albeit painfully, made the transition from an industrial to a high
tech economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that doesn't mean Israel will inevitably end up like New
England, unless it manages its future well,'' Thurow warns. ``The
dying industries can overwhelm the growing industries.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the pain of the transition of the economy is evident in
Israel as unemployment continues to climb, edging toward 9 percent
this month. The dropoff in jobs is a result of a transformation
from the lower-value-addded manufacturing sector, where hundreds of
thousands were once employed, to super-high-margin software
businesses that employ fewer, but more educated and skilled,
people. Mirabilis is a prime example. Despite its tremendous
success and the wealth it has created for its owners, the company
employs only 65 people.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's policy of maintaining an
overvalued shekel has been clearly tilted in favor of the high tech
businesses. This has kept inflation down to about 7 percent and
helped venture capitalists, but it sacrifices jobs in the
manufacturing companies that seek to export goods overseas because
it makes the goods more expensive. The bulk of the workers in
manufacturing are the working class Sephardim, or Jewish immigrants
mainly from Arab countries, who have supported Netanyahu's Likud
government. These economic policies could eventually spell
political danger for Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are creating a deep class division here. And it will
create a lot of unrest,'' says Nat Shenker, the president of Oletex
Industries Ltd., a textile company in Jerusalem that employs 300
people and has been suffering in the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu feels a high tech economy may be insulated from the
constant tensions in the region.
</P>
<P>
   In a June 11 interview with Fortune magazine, Netanyahu said:
``The amazingly growing sector in Israel is the high-tech sector.
And that is the most impervious to political or military
developments... Peace would be a useful condition, but it is not
the primordial, necessary condition, which is anywhere, economic
freedom _ and we are increasing that kind of freedom by leaps and
bounds.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are many business leaders and economic analysts who
think Netanyahu is dangerously misguided, and that the economic
fate of Israel and the region will depend on the peace process,
which for the last 16 months has been derailed. Specifically,
analysts point to declining foreign investment in Israel as a sign
that the investors' optimism that surrounded the peace process is
fading. Overseas investment in the first five months of 1998 was
$806 million, down dramatically from $1.5 billion in the same
period last year, according to Israel's central bank.
</P>
<P>
   Even President Ezer Weizman, whose role is largely ceremonial
and rarely confrontational, has taken Netanyahu on by boycotting an
annual economic conference last month. He blames Israel's economic
stagnation and what he sees as the economy's failure to live up to
its potential on Netanyahu's unwillingness to break the impasse in
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a clear opinion that you can't isolate economics and
security from the policies of war and peace,'' Weizman said. ``The
peace today is sputtering and is limping -- and the economy along
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the successes and the more recent vascilations of the
Israeli economy may have more to do with the process of change
through the half century of Israel's existence.
</P>
<P>
   The kibbutz movement during and before the founding of the
Jewish state in 1948 was at the center of ``overturning the Jewish
pyramid,'' as kibbutzniks called it. It meant taking a highly
educated population of Jews from Europe after World War II with few
agricultural or industrial skills and creating a broad Jewish
workforce out of it. The ethos of Zionism and its Labor Party was
to glorify working the land and working with your hands to build
Israel. They needed brawn, not just brains, to create a state that
could survive economically and militarily.
</P>
<P>
   Israel now finds it needs once again to turn the pyramid, to go
back to the focus on education and continue its transition from an
agricultural and manufacturing economy into a global economy and
its requirements for a highly educated and trained workforce.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon Shulman, 42, an international lawyer who works with a
software company in Jerusalem, lives on Kibbutz Gezer and supports
the new high tech venture on the collective. Most of the nation's
250 kibbutzim and the roughly 120,000 people who live on them have
fallen on lean times in the last decade. But it's not because they
don't work hard. Although they represent only 3 percent of the
population, they provide 40 percent of the country's agriculture,
about 8 percent of its industrial output, and 10 percent of its
tourism. The reality is that the ethos of collective living has
faded, and so the kibbutzim will have to look for creative ways to
stay alive in the historic shift in Israel's economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways the kibbutzim are economically conservative. It
was a big risk for us to invest in Gezernet. But it is the right
decision,'' says Shulman, who lives on the kibbutz with his wife
and six-year-old daughter. ``Not only because information and
technology are the future. But because we will have to come up with
new ways to keep the next generation on the farm. We're doing it to
keep our community together. It's all about the future.''

   KIBBUTZ GEZER, Israel _ Set in the golden fields of the Ayalon
Valley, this kibbutz at first glance presents a vision of the early
Zionist ideal of working the land. Dairy cows moo in faded old
barns and tractors rumble up a hillside with a load of watermelons
from the fertile valley.
</P>
<P>
   But in a small office in the back of an old dining hall, the
future for this kibbutz and for all of Israel's economy can be
heard in the clicking of computer keyboards in the collective's new
internet service provider company called ``Gezernet.''
</P>
<P>
   Gezer's prize dairy herd may still be the bread and butter of
the kibbutz's annual budget, but its two-year-old venture into the
world of high tech is its promise for the future. It also is a
symbol for Israel's changing economy.
</P>
<P>
   As Israel celebrates its 50th anniversary of statehood this
year, it is in the process of a dramatic transformation from its
beginnings, which stressed agriculture and manufacturing, to a new
kind of technological pioneering that will take it into the next
century. Agriculture, which for decades was Israel's major source
of export earnings, now accounts for only 3 pecent of all exports.
Israel is now in fact a net importer of food.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is fast on its way to carving out a niche for itself in
the global economy as ``Silicon Valley East.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an evolution, not a revolution,'' says Israeli Finance
Minister Yaakov Neeman. ``Fifty years ago, the kibbutzniks were the
pioneers in this country. They were young and ambitious and
idealistic. And now this spirit will be in the field of high
technology. Young engineers and programmers will be the new
pioneers of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Partly because Israel has relied for so long on billions of
dollars each year in American aid, it is difficult to analyze the
country's economic success. Still, its achievements over 50 years
are considerable.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the continuing heavy burden of defense spending in this
volatile region, economic modernization has raised Israel's Gross
Domestic Product to almost $17,000 per person. That far exceeds the
GDP per person in neighboring countries such as the much more
highly populated Egypt, also a major recipient of American aid,
which still struggles in poverty at roughly $2,900 GDP per person.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's growth since the 1991 Gulf War and the onset of the
historic 1993 Israeli-Palestinian peace accords has been
impressive. However, the current deadlock in the peace process
could, if it continues indefinitely, dash the hopes of Israel's new
economy. The lifeless peace process already is beginning to hurt
the economy, according to some analysts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Israel's GDP was about $50 billion and $10 billion in
US loan guarantees were needed to finance Jewish emigration from
the former Soviet Union. Today, Israel's GDP is more than $100
billion.
</P>
<P>
   High tech is largely responsible for the growth, economic
analysts say. Israel's 50 largest high tech businesses generate
about $20 billion a year for the economy and now employ an
estimated 70,000 people. And since 1991, Israel has started some
3,000 high tech companies, the greatest number of high tech
startups in any country except the United States. About half of the
companies have survived and employ 150,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is making its mark mostly in the area of security and
telecommunications software. A company known as CheckPoint
Software, for example, has cornered the market on a service that
protects computer systems from viruses and hackers. The mix of a
growing entrepreneurial culture, a highly educated work force and
an extensive research and development infrastructure has also
attracted many multinationals to Israel, including Intel, IBM and
Digital.
</P>
<P>
   Helping pave the way for Israel's success is the opening of the
economy through privatization. It is a process that has evolved
since Israel's economic crisis in the mid-1980s but Netanyahu's
government has been more focused than his predecessors on breaking
up powerful, state-run businesses, such as the banking and
transportation industries.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation of the unwieldly and largely inefficient
public service sector still has a long way to go, according to
Yakov Frankel, chairman of the Bank of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between the first 50 years and the next 50
years will be shifting the economy away from government control. It
is the only way we will be able to lower the tax burden and create
a free market,'' says Frankel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many people who look at our successes, and say we
have to give ourselves time. But the hard truth is there is no
time. We are very late in entering the global market,'' adds
Frankel.
</P>
<P>
   To Neeman, there is no better illustration of the pioneering
spirit in Israel's opening economy than the story of Mirabilis Ldt.
The small Israeli software company was started by three Israelis in
their early 20s who traveled to California's Silicon Valley, saw
what was going on and brought that back to Israel, joining the pool
of 3,000 startup high tech companies. The difference between theirs
and the others is that they made it. Mirabilis, which had an
investment of $2 million by its owners, Neeman loves to point out,
was bought by America On Line Inc. on June 8 for $287 million in
cash. In 2001 AOL will make addition payments of $120 million based
on performance.
</P>
<P>
   The company makes downloadable software for chatting on the
Internet in real time. Although the firm does no marketing or
advertising, 13 million people have downloaded its software.
</P>
<P>
   But Israel should not be so quick to pat itself on the back,
some analysts caution. Despite the high tech fairy tales that have
made a few people fabulously rich, Israel is still lagging behind
the top performers in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   Lester Thurow, the MIT economist, is chairman of a program
called Technion Institute of Management in Tel Aviv that provides
advanced management training to Israel's high tech executives.
Thurow is a friend of Israel, but very tough on its economy.

BMW FIELDS A CONVERTIBLE WITH A TRULY REMARKABLE TOP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, July 19 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Convertibles are the cars of summer,the perfect chariots for
balmy days, top down, wind in the hair, sun shining _ at least
that's the image. The convertible is the car that everybody dreams
of, longs for, but that hardly anybody buys. Everybody wants one
sometime, but hardly anybody wants one all the time.
</P>
<P>
   The ragtop is a car of youth and of second childhoods, of
yearnings and romance. A practical car it is not. Well, that's the
common wisdom, but the columnist does harbor some contrary
opinions.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, a convertible shouldn't be thought of as strictly
topless summertime transport. In fact, summertime is frequently the
worst time to be driving sans roof, especially if you are balding.
The wind in what's left of your hair won't prevent sunburn, and the
protection afforded by a hat is difficult to secure at road speed.
When it's 90 degrees in the shade, the seats are hot, the wind is
hot ... this driver keeps the roof in place and cranks up the air
conditioning to the ``meat locker'' setting.
</P>
<P>
   The best time to lower the canvas, in my opinion, is late
afternoon/ early evening, just before the sun goes down. The sun
low on the horizon is less of a burn threat, the wind in your hair
a distinct treat in the absence of blast-furnace heat. Yes, the
mosquitoes seem to swarm at sundown, but they have a tough time
catching you at 55.
</P>
<P>
   The modern convertible with well-fitted, insulated top and a
glass backlight (that's trade jargon for the back window) with
electric defroster is an all-weather car. And snow on the roof is
easily removed; just get in and give the ragtop a few thumps with
your fist.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best moments for the convertible are those first
warm days of spring when the snow is on the run and those lazy
afternoons of Indian summer with the foliage assuming the bright
hues of autumn. The ragtop is _ or at least can be _ a car for all
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's the way I was viewing things on a balmy summer
night as I discovered to my delight that the BMW convertible just
delivered had a high-tech, one-touch motorized top. I have never
been a fan of manual tops, although some of them have been
engineered to be simple _ the Mazda Miata comes to mind.
</P>
<P>
   The convertible awaiting was the M3 ragtop, a handsome little
performance model in Dakar yellow _ Dakar is a city in Africa, and
I never knew it had its own color _ with a black roof. One key
stroke in the door opens all the locks, so I dump the papers and
stuff in the trunk where they won't blow all over the roadway, slip
behind the wheel, crank up the 240-horsepower, 3.2-liter
six-cylinder, and press the magic button. Let the dance begin.
</P>
<P>
   A ballet it is as the top unhooks from the brow of the
windshield, the rear deck opens, and the canvas rises, bends,
convulses into the innards of the car, and the lid snaps shut. Off
we go, but the wind isn't blowing the hair much; the Expressway is
a crawlway at 6:15 p.m. Soon, I am sweating, beginning to feel
gritty _ that's gritty as in dust-covered from the Boston's Big
Dig. But the creep through town is interesting for those of us
curious about the construction processes, equipment, and structural
details. Why, for example, is part of one of the new elevated
roadways that are replacing the old elevated roadway in the name of
``depressing'' it, built of prefab concrete pieces that suddenly
join a deck laid on steel frames? And what is being depressed,
exactly, other then the commuters ... but I digress.
</P>
<P>
   By 6:45 or so, I'm on Route 1 and the speed has increased some;
it is necessary to crank up the radio volume. The radio controls
are the pits, not meant to be manipulated while in motion. Finally,
I turn onto Interstate 95; the wind is positively whistling across
the pate, the sun is a fierce orange ball on the rim of the
horizon, and David Brudnoy is waxing eloquent on the air waves _
with the volume set to Blaster, I can hear him. This is the
convertible at its best.
</P>
<P>
   This is the topless version of the BMW performance model, the
M3, a rear-drive speedster with a gutsy six-cylinder engine mated
with a very smooth 5-speed manual gearbox. The multi-valve engine
is elastic enough _ and powerful enough _ that the car in high gear
might as well be an automatic; in fifth, you can accelerate quite
smartly, coast down to relatively low speed, then boost it back to
real speed quite nicely without ever changing gears. Accelerate in
any gear.
</P>
<P>
   Although most people tell me that manuals are not what you want
when negotiating the latest undulations of the Big Dig in rush
hour, I do find that it is possible to creep in low gear without
constantly braking and declutching. Yes, some people do jump in
front as the space opens now and then, but they don't get anywhere
any faster for the effort and they aren't really impeding my small
progress. But BMW manuals do have their drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   In the Hampton (N.H.) Toll Plaza, I encounter said drawbacks. I
pay the toll, slip the shifter into first and step on the gas. The
M3 bolts backward _ I'm in reverse. I try again, paying more
attention this time. I go backward. The guy behind me is not seeing
the humor of this situation. OK folks, I know what some of you are
thinking, but I do know how to operate a manual gearbox, I do know
how to drive, dammit, and BMW is dead wrong not to gate the
transmission so that reverse is well differentiated from first.
</P>
<P>
   It can't be a matter of cost. How much can such a small change
add to the price of a $45,900 _ plus $570 delivery _ automobile?
That's the M3 ragtop's main fault: price.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, while the trunk is sacrificed for the rooftop
retractors, the back seat remains usable for adults _ but not this
adult. On the minus side, although the car is generously equipped,
the dual mode climate control doesn't quite hack it. With a driver
wanting cool and a passenger wanting warm, the passenger still gets
a cool breeze from the vents. If the passenger is warm, so is the
driver. Nor is the system fully automatic; the AC must be engaged
manually.
</P>
<P>
   The seat controls are less than convenient, and interior storage
is somewhat limited _ small glove box and door bins. An armrest
covers two cupholders and a coin holder _ why does a proper driver
need an armrest?
</P>
<P>
   BMW may have fumbled details, but there is no denying the
excellent performance, the sheer joy of driving the topless M3. The
ride is firm, forgiving, the handling precise, crisp, indicative of
a rigid chassis. Excellent acceleration (0-60 in 5.8 seconds) is
complemented by quick controlled braking. BMW's all-weather
traction control promises winter performance, too. Fuel mileage
isn't bad, either _ 24.54 miles per gallon over 1,155 miles
tracked. I guess I really liked it to drive it that much _ about
1,500 miles total _ in a week.

<P>
   A legless virtual android called Adonis has been taught to
``dance'' the macarena as a first step in a project designed to
help robots learn by imitation.
</P>
<P>
   The computer simulation has been developed by Maja Mataric from
the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, Victor Zordan
of Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta and Zachary Mason
from Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass. Their chief aim, Mataric
says, is to create mechanisms that robotic hardware and software
can use to learn any task.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier work had established that humans look at their tutor's
hands when learning a physical routine, such as the movements
associated with a dance. But when we actually come to do it, the
correct arm, head and neck movements follow. Our own set of
behavioral primitives _ the basic movements on which more complex
ones are based _ means that when we do something with our hands,
the rest of the body follows automatically.
</P>
<P>
   Mataric says imitation is extensively used by animals and could
make robots much more flexible. Although it is possible to simply
copy control software from one robot to others, because each is
unique they will not do the job as well as they would if they had
``picked it up'' by observation.
</P>
<P>
   Before Adonis can start to watch and learn, he first needs a
basic set of behavioral primitives to build upon. So the
researchers decided to teach him to make the arm and hand movements
of the macarena. They decided to simulate a dance because it is
easier to spot when Adonis has got it right. More subtle movements
would be harder to evaluate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you like the macarena, you'll know if it's right or not,''
Mataric says.
</P>
<P>
   She adds that the macarena is ideal, because it involves
distinct movements that can be broken up into easily learnt parts.
In the dance, the hands are moved and placed on different parts of
the body. Mataric says the changes in direction and speed in the
dance will provide useful points for splitting up the behaviors
later.
</P>
<P>
   The basic behavior set is based around 12 hand and arm-related
movements of the 14-step version of the macarena. Spanish singing
duo Antonio Romero and Rafael Ruiz _ aka Los del Rio _ had an
international hit with the song Macarena in 1995. It was released
in several versions with different tempos and numbers of movements.
The dance involves extending the arms, touching hands to different
parts of the body and crossing the arms.
</P>
<P>
   The two movements that Adonis can't do involve jumping a quarter
turn and swinging the hips. Mataric and her colleagues simulated
only the upper body so Adonis has no feet to jump with and no hips
to swing, though he can bend at the waist.
</P>
<P>
   Adonis' head, neck and arms are subject to the same constraints
as those of humans. His joints have the same degrees of freedom
that human elbows and wrists do. He also has to contend with the
software equivalent of gravity and inertia.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Adonis can do the macarena, Mataric and her colleagues
are planning to add a sensory component to the simulation _ for
example, video cameras _ to allow Adonis to watch someone do
another dance such as the mashed potato or the watusi and then use
parts of the macarena to mimic what he has seen.
</P>
<P>
   This will be a key advance in artificial intelligence. ``If you
are learning from scratch every time, that is not as powerful and
not the kind of thing that is seen in biology,'' Mataric says. &QL;

   Electronic ``tongues'' could soon be used to monitor the quality
control of bottled mineral water. The devices could also sample
complex solutions such as blood or urine.
</P>
<P>
   The human tongue can distinguish between a dazzling array of
subtle flavors using a combination of just four elements of taste:
sweet, sour, salt and bitter. Each element is detected by one of
the four types of taste bud located on the tongue. Now researchers
at the University of Texas in Austin have designed an electronic
tongue that works along the same lines.
</P>
<P>
   Using chemical sensors, they have demonstrated that the
electronic tongue can ``taste'' different solutions. The team
attached four well-known chemical sensors to minute beads made of
polyethylene glycol and polystyrene. The beads were placed in
micromachined wells on a silicon wafer.
</P>
<P>
   The sensors respond to chemical stimuli by changing color, so
the wafer was placed between a light source and an image sensor.
The responses were monitored as red, green and blue light channels
from each well.
</P>
<P>
   The first device they built was designed to detect calcium and
cerium ions, acidity and the simple sugars. Each sensor responded
differently to the various conditions. For example, one turned
yellow in response to high acidity, red if cerium ions were present
and purple under basic conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The sensors responded to different combinations of the four
artificial taste elements with unique combinations of red, green
and blue, enabling the device to analyze for several different
chemical components simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Anslyn, a chemist at the university, hopes ultimately to
make a device ``even more sensitive than the human tongue.'' For
now, his device has only nine wells on a half-centimeter wafer, but
he says current technology allows more than 100 wells in the same
area. The researchers plan to replace the numerous tests carried
out on a blood sample with a single test.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic tongue could monitor the quality of simple
solutions, says John Warburton, a director of Neotronics
Scientific, based in Essex, England. The company manufactures
electronic noses. Such instruments detect volatile compounds that
evaporate from a solution to give an odor.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good application would be something like mineral water,
where you are trying to sell a product that should have no taste or
a very simple taste,'' Warburton says.
</P>
<P>
   He points out that some of our sensation of taste comes from our
sense of smell. The electronic nose and tongue could work together,
he suggests, to analyze compounds in solution as well as those that
evaporate. ``For a certain type of material, there's probably a
great deal of synergy between the two,'' he says.  &QL;

BMW FIELDS A CONVERTIBLE WITH A TRULY REMARKABLE TOP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, July 19 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Convertibles are the cars of summer,the perfect chariots for
balmy days, top down, wind in the hair, sun shining _ at least
that's the image. The convertible is the car that everybody dreams
of, longs for, but that hardly anybody buys. Everybody wants one
sometime, but hardly anybody wants one all the time.
</P>
<P>
   The ragtop is a car of youth and of second childhoods, of
yearnings and romance. A practical car it is not. Well, that's the
common wisdom, but the columnist does harbor some contrary
opinions.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, a convertible shouldn't be thought of as strictly
topless summertime transport. In fact, summertime is frequently the
worst time to be driving sans roof, especially if you are balding.
The wind in what's left of your hair won't prevent sunburn, and the
protection afforded by a hat is difficult to secure at road speed.
When it's 90 degrees in the shade, the seats are hot, the wind is
hot ... this driver keeps the roof in place and cranks up the air
conditioning to the ``meat locker'' setting.
</P>
<P>
   The best time to lower the canvas, in my opinion, is late
afternoon/ early evening, just before the sun goes down. The sun
low on the horizon is less of a burn threat, the wind in your hair
a distinct treat in the absence of blast-furnace heat. Yes, the
mosquitoes seem to swarm at sundown, but they have a tough time
catching you at 55.
</P>
<P>
   The modern convertible with well-fitted, insulated top and a
glass backlight (that's trade jargon for the back window) with
electric defroster is an all-weather car. And snow on the roof is
easily removed; just get in and give the ragtop a few thumps with
your fist.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best moments for the convertible are those first
warm days of spring when the snow is on the run and those lazy
afternoons of Indian summer with the foliage assuming the bright
hues of autumn. The ragtop is _ or at least can be _ a car for all
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's the way I was viewing things on a balmy summer
night as I discovered to my delight that the BMW convertible just
delivered had a high-tech, one-touch motorized top. I have never
been a fan of manual tops, although some of them have been
engineered to be simple _ the Mazda Miata comes to mind.
</P>
<P>
   The convertible awaiting was the M3 ragtop, a handsome little
performance model in Dakar yellow _ Dakar is a city in Africa, and
I never knew it had its own color _ with a black roof. One key
stroke in the door opens all the locks, so I dump the papers and
stuff in the trunk where they won't blow all over the roadway, slip
behind the wheel, crank up the 240-horsepower, 3.2-liter
six-cylinder, and press the magic button. Let the dance begin.
</P>
<P>
   A ballet it is as the top unhooks from the brow of the
windshield, the rear deck opens, and the canvas rises, bends,
convulses into the innards of the car, and the lid snaps shut. Off
we go, but the wind isn't blowing the hair much; the Expressway is
a crawlway at 6:15 p.m. Soon, I am sweating, beginning to feel
gritty _ that's gritty as in dust-covered from the Boston's Big
Dig. But the creep through town is interesting for those of us
curious about the construction processes, equipment, and structural
details. Why, for example, is part of one of the new elevated
roadways that are replacing the old elevated roadway in the name of
``depressing'' it, built of prefab concrete pieces that suddenly
join a deck laid on steel frames? And what is being depressed,
exactly, other then the commuters ... but I digress.
</P>
<P>
   By 6:45 or so, I'm on Route 1 and the speed has increased some;
it is necessary to crank up the radio volume. The radio controls
are the pits, not meant to be manipulated while in motion. Finally,
I turn onto Interstate 95; the wind is positively whistling across
the pate, the sun is a fierce orange ball on the rim of the
horizon, and David Brudnoy is waxing eloquent on the air waves _
with the volume set to Blaster, I can hear him. This is the
convertible at its best.
</P>
<P>
   This is the topless version of the BMW performance model, the
M3, a rear-drive speedster with a gutsy six-cylinder engine mated
with a very smooth 5-speed manual gearbox. The multi-valve engine
is elastic enough _ and powerful enough _ that the car in high gear
might as well be an automatic; in fifth, you can accelerate quite
smartly, coast down to relatively low speed, then boost it back to
real speed quite nicely without ever changing gears. Accelerate in
any gear.
</P>
<P>
   Although most people tell me that manuals are not what you want
when negotiating the latest undulations of the Big Dig in rush
hour, I do find that it is possible to creep in low gear without
constantly braking and declutching. Yes, some people do jump in
front as the space opens now and then, but they don't get anywhere
any faster for the effort and they aren't really impeding my small
progress. But BMW manuals do have their drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   In the Hampton (N.H.) Toll Plaza, I encounter said drawbacks. I
pay the toll, slip the shifter into first and step on the gas. The
M3 bolts backward _ I'm in reverse. I try again, paying more
attention this time. I go backward. The guy behind me is not seeing
the humor of this situation. OK folks, I know what some of you are
thinking, but I do know how to operate a manual gearbox, I do know
how to drive, dammit, and BMW is dead wrong not to gate the
transmission so that reverse is well differentiated from first.
</P>
<P>
   It can't be a matter of cost. How much can such a small change
add to the price of a $45,900 _ plus $570 delivery _ automobile?
That's the M3 ragtop's main fault: price.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, while the trunk is sacrificed for the rooftop
retractors, the back seat remains usable for adults _ but not this
adult. On the minus side, although the car is generously equipped,
the dual mode climate control doesn't quite hack it. With a driver
wanting cool and a passenger wanting warm, the passenger still gets
a cool breeze from the vents. If the passenger is warm, so is the
driver. Nor is the system fully automatic; the AC must be engaged
manually.
</P>
<P>
   The seat controls are less than convenient, and interior storage
is somewhat limited _ small glove box and door bins. An armrest
covers two cupholders and a coin holder _ why does a proper driver
need an armrest?
</P>
<P>
   BMW may have fumbled details, but there is no denying the
excellent performance, the sheer joy of driving the topless M3. The
ride is firm, forgiving, the handling precise, crisp, indicative of
a rigid chassis. Excellent acceleration (0-60 in 5.8 seconds) is
complemented by quick controlled braking. BMW's all-weather
traction control promises winter performance, too. Fuel mileage
isn't bad, either _ 24.54 miles per gallon over 1,155 miles
tracked. I guess I really liked it to drive it that much _ about
1,500 miles total _ in a week.

   A computer program stands accused of practicing law without a
license. The software's publisher is being sued by a subcommittee
of the Texas Supreme Court under legislation that protects lawyers
from unaccredited competitors.
</P>
<P>
   If the subcommittee wins the lawsuit, Parsons Technology of
Hiawatha, Iowa, which markets Quicken Family Lawyer, will be banned
from selling its product in Texas. The case may come to trial in
December.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't told us exactly what the nature of our violation
is,'' says Darrell Jordan of Hughes &AMP; Luce, the Dallas law firm
representing Parsons. ``But it seems pretty clear they are
targeting software.''
</P>
<P>
   Another publisher of self-help legal software, Nolo Press of
Berkeley, Calif., has been notified that the same subcommittee will
hold a hearing next month to determine the legality of its product.
Two other producers of legal software are also thought to be under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Quicken software can be used to draft documents such as
wills and leases. In a section called ``Ask Arthur Miller,'' the
famous Harvard lawyer of the same name appears on video and
expounds on issues ranging from choosing a lawyer to deciding
whether or not you can afford to buy a house.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Ticer, the Dallas lawyer who chairs the Supreme Court
subcommittee, insists that it is not singling out software. In
1992, he says, a book written by someone with no legal
qualifications was judged to have breached the statute invoked
against Parsons Technology. But Ticer argues that the Quicken
program may represent a more serious breach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It asks you questions, selects forms for you, and a lawyer
pops up and gives you advice. If that isn't dispensing legal
advice, what is?'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But Nolo's associate publisher, Steve Elias, says he does not
see how computer code can be accused of practicing law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers know the difference between a lawyer and a
program,'' he says. ``The idea of the program being a lawyer in a
box just doesn't make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   He points out that the software's introductory screen tells its
users: ``You must use you own judgment and, to the extent you
believe appropriate, the assistance of a lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if such programs were to be outlawed in Texas, he argues
that the ruling would be unenforceable, as the software could still
be downloaded from the Internet or ordered from booksellers
operating on the Web. &QL;

BRUCE BABBITT AND THE POLITICS OF THE ENVIRONMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt stood beaming with Bill Clinton
at the Grand Canyon in Arizona two years ago as the president used
executive authority to designate the 1.7 million-acre
Escalante-Grand Staircase a national monument in nearby southern
Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt had reason to smile.
</P>
<P>
   Proclamation of the monument, just before the 1996 election,
would help Clinton become the first Democratic presidential
candidate since Harry Truman to win Babbitt's home state of
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a down side. Although the Escalante-Grand
Staircase is in Utah, Clinton dared not venture into that state for
the dedication. There, the national monument was denounced as a
federal land grab.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt, one of the few Western voices with an ear at the White
House, understands that environmental politics can cause a split as
wide as the canyon lands dividing Arizona and Utah. But he has also
been around enough to know that progress is often a product of
compromise with one's political adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   And Babbitt works for a president who has attempted to find a
moderate middle even when confronted with issues that don't lend
themselves to consensus.
</P>
<P>
   The way Babbitt has mediated the distance inherent in the battle
over how to conserve the nation's land, water and species has
earned him enemies on all sides.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even some of his most outspoken critics agree that
Babbitt's coalition building has made him one of the president's
most effective advisers _ and one of the few survivors of Clinton's
original Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt, 60, always looks happiest when he is farthest from
Washington, D.C., even when his kayak is nearly capsized by a
Glacier Bay iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   The lanky Arizonan, who is in his sixth year on the job, has
served longer than any Interior secretary since Stewart Udall in
the 1960s. But Babbitt has not been well-treated by a capital
preoccupied with power, pecking order and political scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Hailed as a reformer on his arrival at the Interior Department,
he was caught between Western Democrats defending the status quo
and unyielding environmentalists when he tried to reform mining and
grazing subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   After a tumultuous first two years as Interior secretary, in
which his efforts for environmental reform were repeatedly undercut
by a cautious administration and recalcitrant Congress, Babbitt
persevered to help the president's comeback.
</P>
<P>
   He had traveled the country on ``Heritage Tours,'' arguing in
speeches that the Republican-controlled Congress was proposing to
dismantle 25 years of legal efforts to safeguard and clean up the
nation's air and water.
</P>
<P>
   And in a 1993 remark he claims not to remember making, Babbitt
told Clinton how the environment would shape the president's
political prospects in the West.
</P>
<P>
   A strong stand for more parks and clean water would boost
support along the West Coast and among urban residents for whom
federal land means recreation and unspoiled beauty.
</P>
<P>
   But, Babbitt reportedly added, the administration would lose the
Mountain States, places where people strongly believe they have the
right to unrestricted use of public lands.
</P>
<P>
   The prediction proved accurate. In 1996, Clinton swept the
coastal and urban West, aided by an Interior secretary who pinned
the anti-environmental label on the Republican-run 104th Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first two years, his policies were misunderstood and
distorted; for the next two years, Bruce Babbitt went out and
explained those policies,'' said Frank Greer, a top Clinton
political adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Once east of the coastal mountains, however, the Mountain West
has become a wasteland for Clinton, Babbitt and the Democrats.
Today, after leaving Seattle, a motorist on Interstate 90 will not
pass into a Democrat-held House district until the Minnesota
border.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rural conservative Democrat, once a mainstay of politics
across the West, has become more endangered than the spotted owl,''
said Tim Hibbitts, an independent Portland-based pollster.
</P>
<P>
   Two Rocky Mountain states carried by Clinton in 1992, Colorado
and Montana, voted against him in 1996. Republican presidential
candidate Bob Dole won a standing ovation in a Montana speech
simply by promising that he would fire Babbitt.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt grew up in an established Northern Arizona ranching and
mercantile family, and attended Notre Dame and Harvard Law School.
He was one of a string of moderate, outdoorsy Western Democratic
governors elected in the 1970s and early 1980s. He was introduced
to Americans not in a news magazine, but in a Sports Illustrated
feature on a governor leading a mid-winter, cross-country ski trip
through the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   The governors were a pragmatic bunch, particularly when it came
to conservation. They recognized the West's attachment to clean
air, open spaces and unspoiled places, but also its antipathy to
bossy federal bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus championed saving Hells Canyon of the
Snake River _ but as a recreation area run by the U.S. Forest
Service and open to hunters and horse riders, not subject to the
more severe rule-making of the National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt campaigned for clean air. He gave Arizona a foreign
policy by lobbying Mexico to cut sulfur dioxide emissions from
smelters across the border. He successfully campaigned to force the
Navajo Power Plant in northern Arizona to install scrubbers to
prevent air pollution over the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clear air is what the Grand Canyon is about,'' Babbitt argued.
``Take away the views, and what do you have left? A big ditch.''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt also was bipartisan, persuading a GOP-controlled state
Legislature to pass sweeping water reform legislation. One
Republican friend he made in the 1970s, when both men were state
attorneys general, was Slade Gorton, now Washington's senior
senator. During a conference in Phoenix, Babbitt took Gorton on a
pre-dawn hike up Camelback Mountain to see the first light of
morning strike the Sonoran Desert.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt also is an old compatriot of Clinton's dating to when
both men were governors active in the moderate Democratic
Leadership Council. In Washington, D.C., however, Babbitt has
encountered strident partisanship, splintered authority and endless
jockeying for position.
</P>
<P>
   Twice during Clinton's first term, Babbitt was considered for a
Supreme Court appointment but was not chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he has found himself under investigation by a special
prosecutor over testimony given to Congress concerning an
application by three Wisconsin Indian tribes to build an
off-reservation casino. A top Interior Department civil servant
turned down the proposed casino, which was also opposed by the
Wisconsin congressional delegation and the state's governor. But
when his department ordered the casino plan killed, Babbitt was
accused of yielding to pressure from a White House political
operative. For the first time in a quarter-century public career,
he has been forced to defend his integrity.
</P>
<P>
   On public land issues, the politics have been just as complex,
although not necessarily as personally bruising to Babbitt. The
environmental political players have included:
</P>
<P>
   _The White House: The Clinton administration has two major power
centers on environmental policy. One is the Interior Department.
The other is the White House, where Vice President Al Gore filled
major positions with key allies _ Katie McGinty at the Council for
Environmental Quality and Carol Browner at the Environmental
Protection Agency. ``It created tension where Bruce expected to be
the lead environmental guy,'' said Denis Hayes, president of the
Seattle-based Bullitt Foundation, which gives money to
environmental causes, and an old Babbitt friend.
</P>
<P>
   _The Green Giant: The environmental lobby has great clout. It
also clings to the view that the federal government is the best
instrument for protecting America's resources and setting rules for
their use.
</P>
<P>
   The mainstream environmental movement also has spawned activist
groups who cry ``sellout'' at any hint of compromise.
</P>
<P>
   _The president: Clinton has a history of subordinating
environmental goals to economic growth. In 1993, he sacrificed
Babbitt's proposed grazing and mining law reforms in order to round
up votes to pass his economic package.
</P>
<P>
   _Republicans: While Babbitt loves to speak of an environmentally
conscious ``new West,'' Republicans have staked their claim as
champions of loggers, miners and grazers. They grilled Babbitt over
the Wisconsin casino application and were skeptical when he denied
carrying out White House demands to turn down the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the cruelest partisan cuts have come from Babbitt's old
friend, Slade Gorton.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1994 election season, Gorton tried to brand Babbitt
as a pursuer of ``radical policy changes that threaten thousands of
jobs in our resource industries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Secretary Babbitt and some environmental groups have portrayed
loggers, miners, ranchers and now farmers as quasi-criminals,''
Gorton declared in a speech.
</P>
<P>
   It was effective rhetoric. The 1994 election saw voters remove
two Democratic House members in Eastern Washington, including House
Speaker Tom Foley. Nationally, Republicans gained control of
Congress, and Gorton became chairman of the Senate Interior
appropriations subcommittee, which controls the budget for
Babbitt's Cabinet department.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt fought back, bringing his Heritage Tours repeatedly to
Gorton's home state.
</P>
<P>
   He took a boat trip on Puget Sound to decry Republican attempts
to weaken the Clean Water Act. He defended endangered species
protection during a visit to watch salmon spawn in Seattle's
Carkeek Park. He picked the Vancouver, Wash., center that monitors
Mount St. Helens volcanic activity to warn against abolition of the
U.S. Geological Survey.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton swept the Evergreen State in 1996. And Babbitt has
returned to reaching across party lines to help regain the
bipartisan alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, on a hike up the Elwha River in Olympic National
Park, the Interior secretary signaled a willingness to compromise
on his demand for immediate removal of two dams that destroyed the
river's once-great fish runs. Babbitt expressed interest in a
one-dam-at-a-time plan advocated by a Port Angeles citizens group.
</P>
<P>
   The message was intended for Gorton, who had resisted removal of
the dams. Soon, the senator came forward with a plan remarkably
similar to that of the citizens panel.
</P>
<P>
   The jockeying has continued, and other points of the bill are
being negotiated across party lines. At recent briefing, Gorton was
asked when he last talked to Babbitt about the Elwha.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night,'' the senator replied. ``You know, he and I differ
on many issues, but we have remained close personal friends.''

BABBITT'S TURBULENT TENURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB TAYLOR  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MISSOULA, Mont. _ Cameras snap and videotapes roll as Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt steps into the swirling Big Blackfoot
River.
</P>
<P>
   Encased in chest waders, Babbitt casts a fly behind a boulder.
He flips the fly onto the currents again and again, but he doesn't
get the flash and splash of a biting trout.
</P>
<P>
   After a few minutes, Babbitt clambers out dripping wet and tells
reporters that ranchers and the government are working together to
restore the river's fish.
</P>
<P>
   More than five years after striding into national office,
Babbitt has been battered by the currents of national politics.
Although he has not reeled in the big legislative catch, he
continues to push his views on conservation through persistence and
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining how his approach has changed, Babbitt offers a
football metaphor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we came in naively expecting that we'd be throwing a
lot of long passes into the end zone,'' he said. Instead, he
adopted the strategy of former Ohio State University football coach
Woody Hayes, who ran the ball forward in short, hard-fought bursts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three yards and a cloud of dust,'' Babbitt said. ``Just keep
grinding away.''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt is crisscrossing the country as much as ever these days.
On this occasion, he has come to Montana to showcase river
restoration. On other trips, he has released transplanted wolves,
planted fish and inspected parks across much of the West.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, Babbitt is promoting conservation through a strategy of
cooperation, not confrontation. This collaborative style _ which
has drawn criticism from both right and left _ has colored his
policies. Early political defeats in Congress and a moderate White
House have caused Babbitt to back off plans for rapid environmental
reform.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt claims the more measured approach is winning new friends
for his efforts to protect the environment. One limited victory
Babbitt points to is protecting the 1973 Endangered Species Act and
developing new ways to enforce it.
</P>
<P>
   The act was under mounting attack from conservatives who called
it an inflexible burden on private property owners. Many
environmentalists feared it would be dismantled. But Babbitt has
helped sustain it by advocating compromise agreements called
Habitat Conservation Plans that allow for private use of land in
return for improvements that lessen harm to endangered and
threatened species.
</P>
<P>
   These deals let miners, loggers and real estate developers
continue to use the land for profit, but force them to do so in
ways that don't destroy their own and neighboring habitats.
</P>
<P>
   Before he took office, only 15 such plans had been written. But
Babbitt grabbed the concept and expanded its use. Although the
scientific grounding of some of the plans has recently been
challenged, there are about 225 in place around the country, and
more are being negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bean, a leading authority on wildlife law at the
Environmental Defense Fund, believes Babbitt has been an effective
secretary. ``He's probably had far more impact on the Endangered
Species Act than any of his predecessors,'' Bean said.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt _ a fan of noted naturalist and wildlife biologist Aldo
Leopold, and a reader of Wallace Stegner, whose novels chronicle
the evolution of the new West _ went to Washington, D.C., in 1993
with big ideas. He wanted to rewrite federal timber, mining and
grazing laws. He hoped to spearhead legislation to increase grazing
fees for ranchers and to stop miners from ravaging federal lands
for token fees. But Babbitt's efforts to impose wholesale change
ended with the election of a Republican Congress in 1994 and have
not recovered.
</P>
<P>
   The Mining Law of 1872 remains on the books, despite Babbitt's
protests that it forces the government to give away billions of
dollars worth of federal minerals for a pittance. And while grazing
fees have inched upward, ranchers continue to get bargain-basement
grass on federal lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised that we've been able to stymie this
administration on so many fronts,'' said Nancie Marzulla, executive
director of Defenders of Property Rights, a Washington, D.C.-based
group.
</P>
<P>
   Some groups believe that Babbitt and his staff have effectively
achieved modest change through compromise and administrative
avenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bypass Congress and go off on their own,'' said Chuck
Cushman, leader of the American Land Rights League, a
Washington-based grass-roots property rights group.
</P>
<P>
   A practical politician who learned how to balance the interests
of opposing groups during nearly a decade as governor of Arizona,
Babbitt helped shepherd Clinton's Northwest Forest Plan into
effect. That plan limited the logging of old growth trees on
federal timber lands, but did allow for some cutting in coastal
national forest areas.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Babbitt's policies have given environmentalists and
recreation groups more influence over federal grazing land
management by establishing Range Advisory Councils to bring modest
reforms to rules governing the grazing of cattle and sheep. He has
also been instrumental in convincing Congress and Clinton to expand
the national park system and to help fend off efforts to diminish
environmental protections offered by the Clean Air Act of 1970 and
the Clean Water Act of 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP, however, has blocked some of his favorite programs,
including halting the money needed to fund the National Biological
Survey, a study that aimed to provide information needed to use the
ecosystems as a focus for conservation policy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, deals have been cut to increase the amount of water
flowing into the Florida Everglades, California's Central Valley
and the Platte River; to protect suburban wildlife habitat in
places including Austin, Texas, and Denver; and to boost wildlife
safeguards on millions of acres of timberland from North Carolina
to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   And the Habitat Conservation Plans that Babbitt has encouraged
as the most realistic way to protect endangered species are having
especially big effects on the Northwest. After an initial period of
caution, big timberland owners have increasingly taken advantage of
the program. In five Western states, plans are complete or are
being drafted to cover more than 11 million acres _ including about
one-quarter of the region's non-federal commercial timberland, an
area the size of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island and
one-third of New Hampshire, combined.
</P>
<P>
   To many landowners, the key change that made participating in
the plans acceptable was Babbitt's ``no surprises'' policy, which
generally promised landowners that if they agreed to do certain
things for a troubled species, the government wouldn't come back in
a couple of years and demand more.
</P>
<P>
   ``They created the thing that was missing in the law:
Certainty,'' said W. Henson Moore, president and CEO of the
American Forest and Paper Association and a leader of the
Endangered Species Coordinating Council, a group of industries
seeking changes in the law.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt is proud the plans are being used by a broader range of
participants and sees them as an example of balancing the needs of
property rights and the protection of biological resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're writing a new and important chapter of
affirmative conservation history,'' he said. ``We've refashioned
the Endangered Species Act from top to bottom administratively.''
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Defense Fund's Bean agrees. ``I think Babbitt
has done a great deal to rescue this act from the political
oblivion that it came close to and made it work effectively on the
ground,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmental groups, however, complain bitterly that
Babbitt has resisted listing certain species as threatened or
endangered. They also claim that many of the habitat plans give
landowners leeway to harm rare species in exchange for vague
protections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without true public participation and scientifically
defensible components, which many plans currently lack, they run
the risk of being dangerous and deceptive political
accommodations,'' said James Wyerman, vice president of the
Defenders of Wildlife, a Washington, D.C.-based environmental
advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists have added to the criticism. The most exhaustive
study of the plans so far, led by University of Washington
researcher Peter Kareiva, found that the plans commonly lack sound
data, analysis and monitoring to show they will help conserve
species.
</P>
<P>
   While the use of habitat planning has grown, the concept is
still vulnerable to being overturned by the courts that may
interpret it as not effectively meeting the criteria demanded under
the Endangered Species Act. Babbitt, though, said that he no longer
fears a sustained and debilitating backlash against the act. He
pointed out that polls show ``overwhelming support'' for the act,
especially in areas that are undergoing urbanization.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are really eager to preserve the values that drew the
growth in the first place,'' Babbitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Only a tinge of gray in his brown hair and a deepening of the
lines in his face hint at the toll that 5{ years in Washington,
D.C., has taken. A quarter-century of politics has toughened him,
said Babbitt, who tries to deflect the attacks he gets _ from all
sides _ with practiced humor. He has even been razzed at the family
dinner table by his son, T.J., a Stanford University student, over
what is meant by ``managing'' wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   ``No good deed,'' Babbitt says, using one of his favorite
phrases, ``goes unpunished.''

   HDTV _ WASHINGTON _ When the Federal Communications Commission

beforehand. Only then do they put their views out for public
comment, which rarely produces much change during the final hearing
process. That's the way things worked in the 1960s, when the FCC
decided that all car radios had to carry FM stations. But when it
came time to consider whether cable TV operators should be required
to carry the digital signals of broadcasters, the commissioners and
the FCC staff observed strict neutrality. The agency's reluctance
to choose sides reflects a deep division between the interdependent
cable and broadcast industries on ``must carry,'' as the issue is
known in trade circles. (Glass, Cox News Service 1000).

 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Headquartered in a cavernous building at 18th and C streets in
Washington, D.C., the Department of the Interior has long been
considered the West's seat in the federal Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Its domain ranges from such conservation-oriented agencies as
the National Park Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service to the
historically development-minded Bureau of Reclamation.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt's paneled office is a
wall with paintings of his predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them include:
</P>
<P>
   _Albert Fall, Interior secretary under Warren Harding from 1921
to 1923, who was convicted of bribery and served a year in prison.
Fall was a central figure in the Teapot Dome Scandal, in which
lucrative petroleum-bearing properties in California and Wyoming
were leased to oil barons Edward Doheney and Harry Sinclair.
</P>
<P>
   _Harold Ickes, Interior secretary under Franklin D. Roosevelt,
who served from 1933 to 1946, the longest tenure in the job. He
also ran the U.S. Petroleum Administration during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Old Curmudgeon,'' as he was nicknamed, presided over vast
reclamation projects in the West as well as major expansion of the
national park system.
</P>
<P>
   _Stewart Udall, Interior secretary in the Kennedy and Johnson
administrations from 1961 to 1969, who championed Native American
rights and conservation. But, as an old Arizona politician, he
supported a bid by the Bureau of Reclamation to build two dams in
the Grand Canyon. That angered environmentalists. ``Would you flood
the Sistine Chapel so tourists could get closer to the ceiling?''
asked a famous Sierra Club newspaper ad. The proposed dams were
scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   Udall had arranged for Lyndon Johnson to proclaim a huge
national monument in Alaska's Brooks Range just before LBJ left
office in 1969. Using his own authority, however, the Interior
secretary renamed Washington, D.C.'s municipal stadium after
Johnson nemesis Robert F. Kennedy. An infuriated Johnson refused to
sign the monument papers.
</P>
<P>
   _Walter Hickel, Interior secretary under Richard Nixon from 1969
to 1970, who was a pro-development Alaska governor who went
``green'' in office. He championed creation of urban parks and
wrote a letter urging Nixon to be sympathetic and tolerant toward
student protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Hickel was fired for the letter, prompting political cartoonist
Pat Oliphant to show a bear running through the forest shouting,
``They got Wally!''
</P>
<P>
   He returned to the Alaska statehouse, where he was surrounded by
lumber workers, miners and some of the country's most vociferous
old-style boosters. There, as governor from 1991 to 1995, Hickel
tried to build roads across national parks and wildlife refuges.
``We can't just let nature run wild,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   _Cecil Andrus, Interior secretary under Jimmy Carter from 1977
to 1981, who is responsible for perhaps the department's greatest
achievement of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Using gentle persuasion and hard-ball politics, Andrus persuaded
Congress to set aside 103 million acres of Alaska as new national
parks, wildlife refuges, wilderness areas, monuments, and wild and
scenic rivers. The Alaska Lands Act more than doubled the national
park system.
</P>
<P>
   _James Watt, Interior secretary under Ronald Reagan from 1981 to
1983, who caused an uproar by trying to expand oil and mineral
exploration into wilderness lands. ``I don't like to paddle, and I
don't like to walk,'' Watt said in a famous speech to national park
concessionaires.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups had a field day with Watt until he made an
offensive remark about blacks, women, Jews and the disabled. That
remark created a national uproar and led to Watt's resignation. The
Sierra Club had 179,000 members when Watt became Interior
secretary. It had 350,000 by the time he resigned.
</P>
<P>
   _Manuel Lujan, Interior secretary under George Bush from 1989 to
1993, who was a New Mexico congressman pressed into service after
Western Republican politicians vetoed GOP Sen. Dan Evans of
Washington as too much of a conservationist.
</P>
<P>
   Lujan had a low profile and took a hands-off management style to
the agency. He was surprised in 1990 one morning when he picked up
his Sunday New York Times to discover a front-page story about how
Olympic National Park managers and other Interior officials were
pressing for removal of two dams from the Elwha River. This was the
first Lujan had heard of it.

WADDLE YOU KNOW? DUCKS MAKE A SPLASH ON SEATTLE TOUR SCENE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ED OFFLEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Seattle has long had guided tours in its downtown
streets and tour boats in Lake Union, but a new venture will do
both in the same trip.
</P>
<P>
   Using reconstructed World War II-era Army amphibious vehicles,
the tour company will offer 90-minute land and water tours of the
city that include a street excursion through downtown from the
Seattle Center to Safeco Field, the future home of the Seattle
Mariners, an amphibious excursion into Lake Union, and a side trip
through the Fremont neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The venture, ``Ride the Ducks Land and Lake Tour,'' operates two
former Army amphibious trucks _ known by their wartime acronym of
``DUKW,'' said Brian Tracey, a co-owner of the operation with Tom
Ismon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was just a rusted out bucket to start with,'' Tracey said
as he climbed up the rear gangway ladder into the passenger area.
While the wartime vehicles were essentially floating cargo trucks,
the redone versions have been heavily modified for the convenience
of passengers. Features include comfortable seats, a solid canopy
roof, roll-up windows and interior heating.
</P>
<P>
   Each vehicle is operated by a ``captain'' who must both be
qualified as a passenger coach operator by the state Department of
Licensing and also hold a master's certificate from the Coast
Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Blackburn, a captain of boats used in the Gulf of Mexico,
is one of the Seattle duck drivers. ``I went from commanding a
230-foot-ship to driving a 40-foot duck,'' he said with a laugh.
``Why? Because this is fun.''
</P>
<P>
   A captain has to be articulate and entertaining. He provides the
commentary as the ungainly duck vehicle trundles down the city's
streets.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent test hop, one passenger asked Blackburn for the
difference between the tour duck and its wartime counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original DUKW had bullets whizzing overhead,'' he drawled.
</P>
<P>
   Blackburn spent as much effort cajoling passengers to quack like
ducks on cue and accosting pedestrians and other drivers with
wisecracks to make them smile, as he did wrestling the 40-foot
vehicle through the city's packed streets.
</P>
<P>
   The original concept for the DUKW was borne out of wartime
necessity, Tracey said.
</P>
<P>
   During the early months of World War II Army planners
contemplated the problems of moving and sustaining military forces
across an amphibious beachhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of amphibious assaults was basically a dismal tale
of defeats and stalemates,'' wrote military historian Geoffrey
Perret in his account of the Army in World War II, ``There's a War
to Be Won.'' ``No one had ever mastered it.''
</P>
<P>
   An early attempt to create a floatable version of the Army jeep
failed because it had ``the amphibious qualities of a safe,''
Perret wrote. But a naval architect named Rod Stephens came up with
a modified design of the Army's 2{-ton truck.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyancy was provided by giving the truck a body of sealed,
empty tanks, with a pair of small propellers to provide forward
motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's faster in water than any truck,'' Stephens said, ``and
she'll beat any boat on a highway!''
</P>
<P>
   Perret concludes the DUKW was one of the five most important
pieces of equipment fielded in World War II that helped assure
allied victory (the others were the bulldozer, the jeep, the 2{-ton
truck and the C-47 transport plane).
</P>
<P>
   More than 21,000 DUKWs were built during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of the 90-minute Seattle-area tour takes place at
a city boat ramp near Gas Works Park on Lake Union. After a sprint
from downtown, Blackburn slowly eased the DUKW down the boat ramp
into the lake.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing a lever, he switched the transmission from the
vehicle's tires to a small propeller mounted underneath the hull,
and the DUKW motored out across the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wonder if this thing is gonna float or not,'' he
announced to several dozen guest riders.
</P>
<P>
   They loudly quacked back.
</P>
<P>
   Tours will depart every hour between 10 a.m. and 7 p.m. from the
``Ride the Ducks'' ticket stand at the corner of 5th Avenue and
Broad Street near the Space Needle. Tickets are available from a
kiosk at the Space Needle across from the Monorail terminus. Prices
are $20 for adults and $15 for children under 12 years. The
operation will continue daily through Sept. 30.

PR CRISIS EXPERT KNOWS ABOUT JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few years ago a guy walked into an El Torito restaurant in
Orange, Calif., and while munching into his taco, bit off the head
of a frog.
</P>
<P>
   Or so he said.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about a story with legs. David Letterman said it was the
slimiest thing served in the restaurant since O.J. Simpson's
defense team had eaten lunch there. Jay Leno said he planned to try
the chain's new Kermit Taco Supreme. The story leap-frogged from
one media outlet to the next across the country.
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of public relations creature from the black
lagoon that can give corporate executives nightmares, and can even
bring down an organization.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Michael Sitrick comes in.
</P>
<P>
   Sitrick is a miracle worker for corporations in crisis. He's a
spin doctor, the guy who makes the bad story disappear.
</P>
<P>
   When a company is facing bankruptcy, a scandal or a lawsuit,
they often call Sitrick, who has finessed such high-profile PR
crises as the Food Lion debacle or the bankruptcy of Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to what one might expect, he doesn't do it by lying or
evading the truth. His strategic moves present the facts of the
matter from a different point of view _ his client's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really good spin is anything but dishonest,'' he said. ``You
present the facts in such a way _ they are so compelling _ that the
story has to come out.''
</P>
<P>
   It's like being a trial lawyer, he said. ``Everyone is entitled
to a PR defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Sitrick, whose firm Sitrick and Company is based in Los
Angeles, has put what he knows about crisis public relations into a
book, ``Spin, How to Turn the Power of the Press to Your
Advantage'' (Regnery, 1998, $24.95.) It's intended as a how-to book
for companies needing to defuse potential public relations blowups,
but for anyone _ journalists and consumers alike _ it's an
entertaining account of the ways we are manipulated, by both sides,
in any budding controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Sitrick relishes a good fight.
</P>
<P>
   In the Food Lion case, the company's reputation smelled worse
than the tainted food it had been accused of selling in a PrimeTime
Live news show.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the company eventually won its case against the
reporters for using false pretenses, it had already lost in the
court of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   That is until Sitrick saw raw footage from video shot by ABC's
undercover reporters. The outtakes told a different, often
contradictory story. In one case, for example, the television
broadcast showed an employee complaining about chicken that didn't
smell right. It didn't include the rest of the tape, which showed
her being instructed to throw out the suspect poultry.
</P>
<P>
   Using those kinds of examples, Sitrick was able to shift the
battle from the issue of whether investigative journalism is in the
public interest, no matter what the means, to an issue of honesty
and journalistic integrity. He won.
</P>
<P>
   There are several simple rules of spin, Sitrick said. But
there's only one unbreakable one: Always tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Sitrick has fired clients for lack of ethics and refuses to take
any who won't give him total access to their operations. Former
reporters investigate each case before he takes it.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond telling the truth, there are some other secrets to
getting a company's side of the story out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest mistake companies make (in a crisis) is not
talking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But if they don't tell their side of the story, someone else
will _ with a different spin.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect reporters to take the corporate version at face
value, however. A company's word isn't enough, he said. Give them
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   If a company has actually done something wrong and is in
trouble, it should own up to the problem and focus on whatever
steps it is taking to ensure the situation can't happen again, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The whole art of spin is not to change the facts of the matter,
but to put them in a different perspective.
</P>
<P>
   So what about the frog?
</P>
<P>
   In the El Torito case, it turns out that frog forensics revealed
no teeth marks matching those of the man who claimed to have bitten
it. In fact, the head was still attached.
</P>
<P>
   Sitrick's team also discovered the alleged frog biter had filed
for bankruptcy, been convicted of credit-card fraud, and once told
a girlfriend about a get-rich scheme involving planting a frog in a
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   That put a whole new spin on the man-bites-frog story that had
threatened to destroy El Torito's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, the story croaked.

`THE PLANE!' RESUMES FLIGHT ON ABC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ ABC hopes to climb out of its ratings funk
this fall with the help of a little sports and a little fantasy.
More specifically: ``Sports Night'' and _ don't laugh _ ``Fantasy
Island.''
</P>
<P>
   Viewers may be surprised that ``Sports Night,'' though scheduled
after ``Spin City'' on Tuesday nights, is not your everyday
half-hour comedy. And the new ``Fantasy Island,'' while faithful to
the Aaron Spelling original in many ways, is intended to be more
than a nightlight for the rec room.
</P>
<P>
   The team behind ``Fantasy Island'' has quite the pedigree. It
includes acclaimed movie director Barry Sonnenfeld (``Men in
Black,'' ``Get Shorty'') and his partner, longtime film producer
Barry Josephson, as well as the multi-honored Diane Frolov and
Andrew Schneider, who spent five years keeping ``Northern
Exposure'' from going south.
</P>
<P>
   If adjectives like ``dark,'' ``quirky'' and ``edgy'' come to
mind when contemplating those names, bingo. This is not your
father's ``Fantasy Island.'' With the iconoclastic Malcolm McDowell
in the role of Mr. Roarke, the mysterious island where people go to
fulfill their fantasies may seem more like Club Dread than Club
Med.
</P>
<P>
   Josephson is polite in comparing the new ``Fantasy Island'' with
the old. But he admits it won't be the same. (For one thing, it
will be shot in Hawaii, not Burbank.) ``I don't think we're shying
away from the old show,'' he told critics in Pasadena this week.
``I just think we're a different show (with) different characters
and different stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so coincidentally, ``Sports Night'' also has a link to the
movies. Its creator is Aaron Sorkin, the man behind the screenplays
of ``A Few Good Men'' and ``The American President.'' To produce
the show, Sorkin hooked up with Ron Howard's Imagine Television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports Night'' is a half-hour series that doesn't follow the
usual sitcom format of setup, punch line, setup, punch line. More
in the tradition of ``MASH,'' it tells a story that may be funny
and poignant at the same time _ and there's a chance it'll run
without a laugh track.
</P>
<P>
   In a ``Larry Sanders'' sort of way, the series goes behind the
scenes of a cable-TV sports show not unlike ESPN's
``SportsCenter.'' Peter Krause and Josh Charles play two anchors
who are not Ted Baxter buffoons, but serious professionals whose
lives are not all fun and games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the mix of comedy and drama is catching everybody's
attention,'' Sorkin said. ``The truth is, I don't really do either
one of them enough to only do one of them. My fastball isn't fast
enough and my curveball doesn't break enough. If I'm going to get
the batter out, I'm going to have to mix up the pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer Christian, the ``Good Morning America'' weather
forecaster these past 12 years, will depart the show in January and
join KGO-TV in San Francisco, an ABC affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   ABC News president David Westin said Christian's successor has
not been chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Christian will be the last of the old guard to leave ``GMA,''
whose overhaul Westin has made a top priority in a bid to regain
some of the audience the once-mighty morning show has lost to NBC's
``Today'' program. Lisa McRee replaced Joan Lunden as co-host last
September, and Kevin Newman claimed Charles Gibson's co-host chair
in May.

<P>
   Sperm taken from a dead man have been used for the first time to
establish a pregnancy. This seems sure to intensify calls for
reproductive technologies to be more tightly regulated.
</P>
<P>
   The man died suddenly, and his family asked for his sperm to be
preserved. A team led by Cappy Rothman, a urologist at Century City
Hospital in Los Angeles, obtained a sample by removing the
epididymis _ the tubes where sperm mature and are stored _
squeezing the sperm out, and freezing them. Rothman has performed
or supervised this procedure about a dozen times. ``It gives people
hope and lessens the pain of suddenly losing a loved one,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time one of the families has asked for the
sperm to be used. After being defrosted, they were injected into
eggs harvested from the man's wife, one of which successfully
implanted in her uterus. The woman is now one month pregnant. She
and her family have asked to remain anonymous until the end of the
third month.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania
in Philadelphia, fears that regulations are lagging behind the
technical advances that have made posthumous reproduction possible.
``These technologies make it possible to steal reproductive tissue
from you without your consent,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, the Human Fertilization and Embryology Act requires
a man to give his written consent if his sperm are to be used when
he is dead. Diane Blood a widow from Nottinghamshire, England,
eventually became pregnant using sperm taken from her husband as he
lay in a terminal coma. She did so in Belgium only after a lengthy
legal battle to win the right to take the sperm abroad.
</P>
<P>
   But in the United States, the first attempts at regulating
posthumous reproduction are only just emerging. A bill now before
the New York State legislature proposes that a man must have given
written consent for his sperm to be retrieved after his death, and
that the request for this to be done may only come from his wife or
partner.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman agrees that legislation may be necessary to control the
use of dead men's sperm, but he argues that restrictions on
retrieving the sperm impose an unnecessary burden on grieving
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he accepts that the procedure isn't always
appropriate. If the dead man clearly didn't want children _ for
instance if he had had a vasectomy _ Rothman says he would not
retrieve a sperm sample. &QL;

   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ In a symbolic and stately farewell,
Russia on Friday entombed its last czar 80 years to the day after
his execution, redeeming what President Boris Yeltsin called ``one
of the most shameful pages of our history.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, after months of controversy, it was a solemn and
glorious ceremony for the royal family killed by a Bolshevik firing
squad in 1918 amid the ascent of Communist rule.
</P>
<P>
   Nine coffins containing the remains of Nicholas II, wife
Alexandra, three of their five children, and four servants were
buried at the Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul in the former
imperial capital. The service was attended by Yeltsin, foreign
dignitaries and about 50 distant relatives, members of the Romanov
family that ruled Russia for 300 years.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, whose surprise decision to attend was announced only
the day before, offered a powerful message of reconciliation
directed at his own fractured country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guilty are those who committed this heinous crime, and those
who have been justifying it for decades, all of us,'' he told
dignitaries and Romanovs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The execution of the Romanov family was the result of an
irreconcilable split in Russian society. Its results are felt to
this day,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has endured a difficult and ongoing transition toward
democracy since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. The nation also
is still reeling from seven decades of Communist rule, which was
preceded by revolution and, before that, a cruel imperial
dictatorship under the Romanovs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must finish this century, which has become the century of
blood and lawlessness for Russia, with repentance and
reconciliation irrespective of political and religious views and
ethnic origin,'' Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the service was blemished by the incomplete participation of
the Roman Orthodox Church, which has rejected genetic evidence
identifying the bones unearthed in 1991. The church leader,
Patriarch Alexy II, refused to attend the ceremony and also barred
bishops and other church officials.
</P>
<P>
   This resulted in several ironies: the presiding local priest was
not allowed to refer to Nicholas II and the other victims by name
during the service, while before him their names were emblazoned on
brass plaques attached to each of the coffins.
</P>
<P>
   He was also outranked by the Roman Catholic Church and Judaism,
both of which had high-ranking representatives among the crowd of
diplomats and Russian dignitaries in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to sanction a burial but not affirm the contents of
the coffins was widely viewed as a cautious concession to the
influential Russian Orthodox Church Abroad. That church, a branch
established by Russian exiles following the revolution, already has
conferred sainthood on Nicholas II and tenaciously has refused to
accept the remains in Russia as those of the last czar.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a sense of tradition and dignity punctuated the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The robed and bearded priest, assisted by deacons, chanted the
burial ritual as incense wafted through the 18th-century cathedral
and a choir sang. The rites culminated with a thrice-repeated
prayer asking ``eternal remembrance'' for the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the cathedral along the banks of the Neva River, cannon
thundered a 19-gun salute _ two shy of the traditional 21, since
the burial was not formally recognized as that of the czar.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, the coffins were lowered into a crypt in the floor.
Nicholas II was the last to descend, his coffin topped with his
sword and scabbard.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives, some weeping, then paraded past, each scooping up a
handful of white sand, representing earth, to toss into the grave,
a ritual that serves as a final farewell common to the Russian
Orthodox and other Christian churches.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   One branch of the Romanov clan was notably absent, the family of
17-year-old Prince Georgy, living in Spain, a leading aspirant to
the throne, should it ever be restored. He, his mother and other
family members attended a rival service at a monastery near Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The service in St. Petersburg was limited to dignitaries and
Romanov relatives, but was available to millions of Russians via
live television coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this burial will change our lives here in
Russia,'' said Valery Gavrilov, manager of a wine shop in St.
Petersburg. ``But from the point of view of history, this was the
right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The family, like Yeltsin, placed the emphasis on Russian unity
and an attempt in the long-overdue burial to allay lingering doubts
society.
</P>
<P>
   ``In time people will recognize and understand what we've done
today,'' said Nikolai Romanov, 76, a distant cousin of Nicholas II
who is widely regarded as current head of the dynasty. ``It will
take time to bury the rest of the horrors of the past 80 years. But
once we do, we will all be freer.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's attendance _ he stopped in St. Petersburg while en
route to a vacation in the nearby Karelia forest _ was praised by
the family, most of whom live outside Russia, as a constructive
gesture and ultimately good for Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably the only Romanov ever democratically elected to
public office and I'm speaking as a politician now. With an event
of this importance, for the chief of state not to have been here
would have been a public relations tragedy,'' said Paul Ilyinsky,
the mayor of Palm Beach, Fla., and son of a cousin of Nicholas II.
</P>
<P>
   Taking their cue earlier from the church and Yeltsin's original
decision to avoid the service, other high-ranking Russian
politicians decided to stay away. Their reluctance to attended
underscored the uncertain implications of an ornate royal burial at
a time when most Russians are suffering amid the country's economic
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   The government scaled back original plans for the event and
spent less than $1 million on the three-day observance, which began
Wednesday in Yekaterinburg, the city where Nicholas and his family
were killed.
</P>
<P>
   But the more modest ceremony, without the accompanying hype of
world leaders in attendance and Russian politicians elbowing for
the limelight, served to make the funeral what a funeral should be:
a dignified family affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mainly, this was unfinished family business,'' said Rostislav
Romanov, a British banker and leading member of the clan. ``Those
people deserved a proper Christian burial and they got it today.''

   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ In a symbolic and stately farewell,

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ When private investigators David Hutchinson and
George Sexton were hired by a local bar owner who suspected he was
being ripped off at the till by a bartender, they needed a new
tool.
</P>
<P>
   A standard still camera with a telephoto lens would be too
obvious. Ditto for a video camcorder.
</P>
<P>
   Even going undercover themselves night after night in the bar
was no good because they might be distracted or their view blocked
at a crucial moment.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson and Sexton instead opted to install a security
surveillance system at the bar.
</P>
<P>
   A video camera the size of a matchbox with a wide-angle lens was
concealed behind an opening no bigger than a pin hole.
</P>
<P>
   The camera was mounted behind a framed liquor ad above the cash
register, with wires snaked through a hole drilled in the wall. The
wires plugged into a videocassette recorder hidden in a case of
potato chip bags among a pile of supplies in a storage area behind
the bar.
</P>
<P>
   The bartender was caught on camera skimming off the top,
bypassing the cash register with wads of cash he stashed in a
secret cannister hidden in a tabletop.
</P>
<P>
   After seven days of clandestine recording, in which the
bartender was recorded stealing on more than one occasion, the
evidence was incontrovertible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The owner was shocked. This was a trusted, longtime
employee,'' Hutchinson said. ``The owner didn't want to believe it,
but the evidence was there in living color.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A picture is worth a thousand words,'' Sexton said.
</P>
<P>
   The bar rip-off could amount to hundreds of dollars on a busy
night, potentially tens of thousands of dollars of cash skimmed off
in the course of a few years.
</P>
<P>
   The bartender was fired and the stealing ceased. By contrast,
the cost of seven days of surveillance was $700. ``We think it's a
good investment,'' said Sexton.
</P>
<P>
   Sexton and Hutchinson, state-licensed private investigators,
both of Clifton Park, N.Y., recently formed Hidden Eyes, a company
that rents, installs and monitors security surveillance systems.
</P>
<P>
   The two P.I.s hooked up in 1990 during the Greyhound bus strike
in Albany. Sexton was hired for security by the company. Hutchinson
was videotaping the strikers for Greyhound.
</P>
<P>
   In local newspaper ads run last month, Hidden Eyes touts its
miniature cameras for home or office to monitor spouses, baby
sitters, children, employees and contractors.
</P>
<P>
   While several businesses like the bar have used the Hidden Eyes
service, the home market has proved a tougher sell. For instance, a
local woman who discussed contracting for a hidden camera in her
teenage son's room because she suspected he was using drugs behind
closed doors eventually backed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are reluctant to bug their own homes,'' Hutchinson
said. ``We're having a hard time cracking into residential
applications. I think deep down people don't want to see what they
suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   In the brave new world of surveillance technology where people
are increasingly under surveillance where they work, where they
shop, where they drive and where they pass through public buildings
the final frontier of one's own home, a supposed sanctum sanctorum,
has been breached.
</P>
<P>
   ``By putting these surveillance cameras in the home, it does
seem to cross another line many of us thought should not be
crossed,'' said Bob Cohen, executive director of the Albany chapter
of the American Civil Liberties Union. ``We're very concerned about
the not-so-creeping losses to our freedom day by day.''
</P>
<P>
   Some would say eavesdropping on spouses or children in the
family home is a quantum leap against personal privacy, to say
nothing of a breakdown in fundamental social discourse.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are parents teaching their children when they don't trust
them enough so they bug their rooms?'' asked Evan Hendricks, editor
and publisher of Privacy Times, a biweekly newsletter based in
Washington, D.C., that reports on erosions of privacy. ``There's
something terribly wrong with society if we fall back on gadgets to
solve human problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Although such use of surveillance cameras in private homes when
authorized by a resident or owner of the home is not illegal, the
issue raises a deeper moral and ethical quandary. Just because the
technology exists, is it right to use it?
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider this doing something bad or evil,'' said
Hutchinson, 45, a former probation supervisor for Albany County,
who became a licensed private investigator in 1984 and formed
Hutchinson Investigations.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the tables were turned, if Hutchinson was being
spied upon rather than the one doing the spying? ``If my wife
wanted to bug me, of course I wouldn't like it,'' Hutchinson
admitted. ``It's an intrusion and it would make me uncomfortable.
But this is legal, people want our service and all bets are off.''
</P>
<P>
   Posing the same question to Sexton made the 50-year-old former
U.S. Army military police officer and licensed private investigator
for the past 11 years squirm as well. ``I wouldn't like it if it
was used on me,'' Sexton said. ``But we're doing it with permission
of the person who owns the house. I agree it's on the boundary of
being intrusive.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson and Sexton consult with attorneys, who often refer
clients to them, prior to installing the hidden cameras. Clients
must then sign a contract. The rate for Hidden Eyes is $100 per day
for video surveillance and an additional $100 per day for audio
surveillance. That includes set-up, review and writing a report.
</P>
<P>
   The hourly fee for the private investigators for on-site human
surveillance is $50 per hour, plus mileage and expenses. It's $100
per hour for both Hutchinson and Sexton to work a case.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny cameras can be hidden almost anywhere in a private
home. Once, they stuck the camera behind living-room draperies. In
another local house, where the homeowners wanted to observe a baby
sitter, a book was hollowed out and the camera recorded through a
hole cut in the cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book sat right on a bookshelf in the living room and the
books were very dusty, so we knew they were for show and not for
reading,'' Sexton said.
</P>
<P>
   Many hours of videotape were reviewed from this ``nannycam,''
but no abuse or neglect was observed. The parents considered it a
sound investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave them peace of mind,'' Hutchinson said. ``We think
that's what this technology can offer the homeowner.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (STORY COULD END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL;
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The apocalyptic celluloid vision of the recent movie ``The
Truman Show'' in which Truman Burbank (played by Jim Carrey),
unbeknownst to him, has every move of his life recorded secretly by
scores of video cameras for broadcast to an audience of millions
suddenly seems not so far-fetched.
</P>
<P>
   That movie and other recent developments such as the explosion
of navel-gazing Internet offerings (the infamous ``JenniCam,''
``HamsterCam,'' ``CatCam'' and scores of other live cameras that
beam the minutiae of mundane lives into cyberspace) is troubling on
many levels to those who take the pulse of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it so sad that people think their lives are not
important or complex or interesting enough to protect them from
public view,'' said Robert Ellis Smith, publisher and editor of
Privacy Journal, a monthly newsletter based in Providence, R.I.
``That whole live Internet camera trend leaves nothing to be
intimate about with your spouse or partner, trusted friends and
confidantes.''
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer and journalist, Smith formed his monthly newsletter in
1974 and has built it up to an estimated readership of 20,000
people. It reports on new technology and the impact on privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said technology marches on, making eavesdropping equipment
cheaper and smaller. Once the sole domain of government officials
and large corporations, cameras that fit in ballpoint pens or tie
clips and portable camcorder units in briefcases are available in
mail-order catalogs at accessible prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Electronic surveillance has become democratized in this
country,'' Smith said. ``It's available to anyone now.''

`ZORRO': DUELING DERRING-DUO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No car chases. No gargantuan guns. No spaceships. No asteroids.
</P>
<P>
   No problem.
</P>
<P>
   Taking its cue from the swashbuckling movies of the '30s and
'40s, ``The Mask of Zorro'' is a refreshingly low-tech action film
whose frontier California setting doesn't keep it from generating a
rousing sense of adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Director Martin Campbell, who steered the spy-guy ``GoldenEye''
toward massive profits, must have seen this traditional western as
a challenge, not a handicap, given today's gaudy and gimmicky
action-movie market.
</P>
<P>
   If necessity is the mother of invention, then imagination is its
other offspring, and ``The Mask of Zorro'' ripples with both.
</P>
<P>
   Blending classical derring-do with today's state of the art in
stunts and on-camera effects, this zealous picture jumps through
hoops to entertain. Indeed, it sports ample dazzle even for today's
overstimulated audiences, who are so overly conditioned by the
loony literalism of bizarre computer-generated effects.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the witless sensory overkill of today's dominant action
films, ``The Mask of Zorro'' is both spirited and friendly, and its
sentiments have more honesty than hokum.
</P>
<P>
   Mixing mayhem with strong doses of humor, romance, tragedy and
personality, it delivers an epic-scaled story whose
larger-than-life heroism is offset by accessible humanity.
</P>
<P>
   This owes in large part to two ideally-cast stars playing Zorro
at two stages: Antonio Banderas and Anthony Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins first bursts from the gate as the masked, black-garbed
Zorro.
</P>
<P>
   Much like Douglas Fairbanks a half-century ago _ and belying his
age of 60 _ Hopkins dashes through an opening scene in which the
masked hero halts an execution and flamboyantly defies soldiers who
keep early 1800s California in the grip of Spanish tyranny.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so he befriends two peasant boys, including Alejandro,
Banderas' character as a lad.
</P>
<P>
   After Don Diego (Zorro) is imprisoned, the film jump-cuts 20
years later, when Alejandro is a scrappy, scruffy rogue with his
own reasons to hate Spain's monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   When Don Diego finally escapes, Alejandro comes under his wing
and learns the ways of the sword so he can take up the torch of
Zorro.
</P>
<P>
   In a richly complicated subplot, he's also smitten by the fiery
Elena, played by Catherine Zeta-Jones. She is Don Diego's daughter
_ yet doesn't know it. She had been stolen from him as a baby and
raised by his enemy, the power-mad Don Rafael (Stuart Wilson).
</P>
<P>
   Don Rafael isn't the best of villains. Grasping for land, gold
and social status, he's more dandy than devil. He also relies too
much on an American mercenary, played by Matt Letscher with an eye
toward Gen. George Custer's arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they're hardly a match for the young or old Zorro.
Then again, they have an army on their side.
</P>
<P>
   Even without a classic clash, the film maintains an eventful
momentum _ but only to a point.
</P>
<P>
   Like many movies today, ``The Mask of Zorro'' is too long. It's
not as bloated as the 2{-hour ``Armageddon,'' but its 136 minutes
still misses ``leave 'em laughing'' status.
</P>
<P>
   It's also too grim at times. A scene with a decapitated head is
a grisly jolt, and by story's end the action veers too much toward
bloodshed and away from dashing style.
</P>
<P>
   But on the whole, it works.
</P>
<P>
   Banderas adds self-effacing charm and sly charisma to the stout
heroism for which Zorro is known, and Hopkins has more weight,
command and dignity than any glorified action potboiler deserves.
</P>
<P>
   Zeta-Jones also shows promise as a heroine who can hold her own
in a sword fight, and the James Horner score is richly romantic.
</P>
<P>
   Whether all this will fly is perhaps the summer's biggest movie
question.
</P>
<P>
   Low-tech, retro heroes such as the Phantom haven't fared well of
late, and the similarly nonsuperheroic Batman _ who Bob Kane
created in Zorro's image _ has fallen on hard times.
</P>
<P>
   But one encouraging fact remains: Even if the world isn't ready
again for Zorro, Zorro is ready for the world.

   ANTHONY-STANTON (Undated) _ It wasn't until three years after
the first women's rights convention at Seneca Falls, N.Y., in 1848
that Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton met. Yet the
partnership they formed blossomed into an independent women's
rights movement that would eventually win women the right to vote
and set the foundation for 20th-century feminism's critique of
American society. Throughout their decades-long friendship, the two
women maintained an intense and fascinating correspondance. The New
York Times asked three writers to respond to excerpts from a letter
Anthony wrote more than 140 years ago. Anthony's letter to Stanton
describes a debate Anthony had with the spiritualist and reformer
Andrew Jackson Davis over the differences between men and women. By

Slavery in North America,'' to be published by Harvard University
Press in September, Professor Ira Berlin of the University of

`BUFFALO 66' A DARK AND PAINFUL COMEDY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few movies deserve the label black comedy as much as ``Buffalo
66.''
</P>
<P>
   Few dramas are as depressing as this movie. But the film just
stays in your mind _ so how many mainstream movies have done that
lately? _ growing funnier and more impressive.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is a tour de force by actor Vincent Gallo, who stars,
wrote, directed and even composed the often intriguing soundtrack.
His worldview, if indicated by this movie, seems to be that a nice,
big lump of coal in your stocking at Christmas is more than anyone
has a right to expect.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a well-disguised vein of sentimentality is
the only explanation for the harsh ain't-life-mean-to-me tone of
much of ``Buffalo 66,'' and for a gimmick ending that offers some
hope of a kind of redemption.
</P>
<P>
   Gallo plays Billy Brown, named, apparently, for the Buffalo
Bills, the hometown football team that means more to his mom than
Billy does. (He was born in Buffalo in '66; hence the title.)
</P>
<P>
   The film opens with Billy being released from prison. If we
didn't suspect Billy was one of life's losers from his greasy hairy
and cat-in-the-headlights look, we figure it out when he asks if he
can get back inside to go to the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   For what seems like hours on a cold Sunday morning, Billy
searches Buffalo desperately and unsuccessfully for a place to find
relief. When he finally gets into a men's room, he becomes
inhibited because he thinks some guy is watching him. Billy (Gallo
has said) is filled with shame over his imperfections, real and
imagined.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of his search for comfort, Billy takes time out to
panhandle phone change off Layla (Christina Ricci), a waifish dance
student with bad makeup, and calls his folks to say he's coming
home for a visit.
</P>
<P>
   When Billy went to prison, he told his parents he was leaving
town on business. He sent them postcards saying he's happily
married and doing well in another town.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate to impress his folks, Billy grabs Layla and forces her
to go with him to his parents' house. She is supposed to make him
look good by saying she's his loving wife, though she looks more
like his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Layla offers only mild resistance, then passive acceptance and
finally enthusiastic support, leading us to question her own
strange psyche.
</P>
<P>
   Billy's parents, played with painful disinterest by Anjelica
Huston and Ben Gazzara, indicate with every word that they hardly
realized Billy was gone for five years, and don't care that he's
back. The visit home is funny, but excruciating.
</P>
<P>
   Billy's mother serves him chocolate. He reminds her that he's
extremely allergic to chocolate. She insists repeatedly that he
always loved chocolate. A little home movie pops into a corner of
the screen, showing baby Billy, his face covered with chocolate and
hideously swollen.
</P>
<P>
   Billy has two other items on his first-day-out agenda. One is to
go bowling _ it was the one thing he ever did well.
</P>
<P>
   The other is to kill the Buffalo field goal kicker whom Billy
blames for his prison term. Billy, no bright light, got into
betting big money on sports. Even dumber, he bet his heart instead
of the odds. He lost.
</P>
<P>
   When he couldn't pay off, Billy's bookie (Mickey Rourke in a
cameo) gave Billy an option: get his legs broken or go to prison in
place of one of the bookie's pals. Billy had to plead guilty to the
crime, and do the time.
</P>
<P>
   Dark and gritty doesn't begin to describe the look and feel of
``Buffalo 66''. From the grainy film to the harsh lighting (no
doubt intentional) to the seamy locations, Gallo drags us through
Downertown.
</P>
<P>
   Gallo, who has been in numerous independent films, clearly has
talent, coupled with a dead-earnest attitude. The film takes itself
very seriously.
</P>
<P>
   So it's a little surprising and disappointing that the twist
ending undercuts the film's harshness with a dim ray of hope. (On
the other hand, what little bit of sympathy we develop for Billy
gladly grasps at that hope.)
</P>
<P>
   Ricci, who is suddenly competing with Parker Posey as
independent film's leading leading lady, has always shown talent,
since the ``Addams Family'' films. Her performance here is nowhere
as fun as her deliciously wicked bad girl in ``The Opposite of
Sex,'' but it is more real and pathetically poignant and perfectly
in tune with what Gallo is doing.
</P>
<P>
   The comedy is hugely understated. Many people will not find
anything funny about it at all. Even if you laugh, you may find it
painful. And slow.
</P>
<P>
   Try to see this movie on a weekend night, when there will be a
larger audience; it will play much funnier with a crowd, especially
if the crowd views itself as hip and cynical.
</P>
<P>
   Rosanna Arquette and Jan-Michael Vincent have small roles.
</P>
<P>
   The film is unrated. It has no nudity, but one bizarre shot of
graphic violence.
</P>
<P>
   And a bad attitude. &QL;

OBSCURE AND OBVIOUS COLLIDE IN GRITTY `HENRY'S FOOL' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a good week for those who think independent films have been
getting too mainstream and cheery. Like ``Buffalo 66,'' Hal
Hartley's ``Henry Fool'' is low-budget and gritty, possessed with a
cynical dark humor.
</P>
<P>
   Life has brought Simon Grim, garbage man, to his knees.
</P>
<P>
   Grim is so overwhelmed by life that most people assume he's
mentally retarded. He lives with his sex-obsessed (or perhaps just
bored) sister (Parker Posey) and his mother (Maria Porter), whose
extreme depression suggests mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the street one day, Simon (James Urbaniak) sinks to
his knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get up off your knees,'' a stranger tells him, not even
looking at Simon.
</P>
<P>
   The stranger is Henry Fool (Thomas Jay Ryan), and from that
moment on he takes over Simon's life. He moves into, without
renting, a basement room in Simon's house, filling it with his
journals. They are an uncompleted novel that he promises will
change the world. If they are ever published.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life's work,'' he says to the curious Simon. ``My Memoirs.
My Confession. I've been bad. Repeatedly.''
</P>
<P>
   Are we to take Henry seriously? We are uncertain, but Simon
certainly does. When Henry suggests that Simon should write
something, Simon does.
</P>
<P>
   Henry is a self-styled great artist, and he soon has Simon, his
instant disciple, writing poetry that Henry finds filled with
greatness. But not everyone agrees. Soon people _ from the kids at
the local coffee shop to major publishers _ are debating Simon's
work. School boards want Simon lynched. The publisher thinks his
work is trash. Simon's sister claims it changed the regularity of
her menstrual cycle. But millions find it incredibly powerful,
sexual, profound.
</P>
<P>
   (Naturally, we never see a word of it.)
</P>
<P>
   But what if, on finding success and becoming a changed person,
Simon learns that all he believes about Henry may be false?
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry Fool'' is a serious work from major independent
filmmaker Hal Hartley (``The Unbelievable Truth,'' ``Amateur''),
whose small, quirky films have a loyal if small art-house audience.
</P>
<P>
   Working in bizarrely heightened, ironic realism that often seems
surreal, Hartley explores the nature of fame in an artless society,
the absurdity that commercialism brings to art, the quality of
loyalty, reality vs. perception _ and heaven knows what else.
</P>
<P>
   ``He takes complicated issues and simplifies them,'' one fellow
says of Simon's poetry. ``I appreciate that.''
</P>
<P>
   That's just the sort of attitude Hartley is skewering.
</P>
<P>
   The film often careens from event to event, unfolding at its own
irregular internal pace, sometimes fast, sometimes infuriatingly
slow.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Buffalo 66,'' it will take a particular type of person to
appreciate ``Henry Fool.'' That doesn't include me. Though I was
sometimes fascinated, I was more often irritated. The borderline
between profound and obvious, between subtle and unnecessarily
obscure was too violated.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is often as strained and false as a Hallmark card, but
blessed with an irreverent sensibility. It's impossible not to
admire Hartley's tackling of these themes and the totally
individualistic way he does it.
</P>
<P>
   Like Simon's unseen poetry, finding meaningful artistry or
dreary trash in ``Henry Fool'' will totally depend on the observer.
The two hours, 21 minutes seem even longer because of the film's
piece-by-piece scene structure and because it first seems to end
about 20 minutes before it actually does. &QL;

<P>
   LINCOLN, Mass. _ ``When I put my labyrinth in a few years ago my
family thought I was absolutely mad,'' says Elizabeth Cherniack.
</P>
<P>
   But she managed to win them over. ``Last Christmas we all walked
it together and had a group hug in the center,'' says the mother of
three and grandmother of one. ``Labyrinths are trendy now.''
</P>
<P>
   Once almost forgotten in the Western world, the labyrinth has
been rediscovered in recent years and is now hailed as a powerful
spiritual and personal transformation tool by traditional
churchgoers and ardent new agers alike. Older than history,
labyrinths _ winding designs with a single and usually circling
path _ are found in cultures as diverse as Native American, ancient
Crete, and Medieval Europe. Also, in some form, in most major
religious traditions.
</P>
<P>
   While it may look rather odd to the uninitiated, enthusiasts say
going around in circles can straighten you out _ or at least make
you think a bit more clearly. The theory is that the act of
simultaneously meditating or praying while walking a circuitous
path in concentric circles engages both hemispheres of the brain to
produce a sense of calmness and a feeling of well-being that, among
other things, makes decisions easier.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows precisely how many labyrinths there are in
Massachusetts or anywhere else in the country. However,
knowledgeable local labyrinthians estimate that there are probably
about 30 accessible to the public in the eastern part of the state
alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labyrinths are more than just a fad, this is a time when
people need energy and to center themselves and they give a sense
of direction,'' says Marty Cain of Newport, N.H., an artist who in
the past half-dozen years has designed more than 60 labyrinths in
this country and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Cherniack say she uses her labyrinth daily year-round,
regardless of weather. ``Walking a labyrinth is centering and gives
me a sense of proportion,'' she says; ``it's a sort of
mini-pilgrimage.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike mazes, which are deliberately confusing and very easy to
get lost in, a labyrinth has no dead ends or tricky turns. There is
only one path, and it always leads to the center and back out again
but by a twisting route. Maze paths are lined with high walls or
hedges that obstruct the view, but a labyrinth is open and you can
always see where you're going, although it's not easy to tell
exactly how you'll get there.
</P>
<P>
   ``A labyrinth is a lot like life, you think you're getting to
the center of things and then you start to move away,'' says Susan
Burgess, a member of St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Marblehead.
When Burgess and other members of the congregation laid out a
labyrinth in the memorial garden on the church lawn in 1993, they
thought they were creating a quiet place for solitary meditation.
That's not exactly what they got.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to chase my 5-year-old grandson down it and then we sit
in the center and talk,'' says Sarah Lincoln Harrison, one of the
church volunteers who traced the labyrinth's path with stones
gathered from the nearby seashore. Many others at St. Andrew's have
also found their own satisfying, individual ways of going around in
circles.
</P>
<P>
   Some churchgoers make a point of walking the labyrinth before or
after services, for instance, while kids just let out of Sunday
school invariably run it as fast as they can. Participants in
12-step programs and yoga classes that meet at St. Andrew's usually
walk slowly and meditatively.
</P>
<P>
   And, with the church's blessing, all are welcome to go through
the labyrinth at whatever pace they want whenever the spirit moves
them. ``We haven't had any miracles,'' says church member Robert
Smythe, ``but a lot of people say they went into the labyrinth with
a problem and came out with a solution.''  &QL; 
 &QL; 
Two traditions  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although they can be any size, labyrinths are typically about 30
or 40 feet across and fit easily into parks and gardens, the naves
of churches, and the floors of public buildings. They can be
temporary or permanent, and are delineated in all sorts of ways.
</P>
<P>
   Cain, who specializes in public art, has traced temporary
labyrinths with beds of flowers, turkey feathers, and white paint
on grassy lawns but also uses permanent materials such as
fieldstones, brick, and chunks of quartz. A dowser, Cain says she
uses whatever appropriate materials are at hand and places her
labyrinths where _ by new age standards _ they belong. ``I just ask
the earth what she wants,''she says, seriously.
</P>
<P>
   For outdoor labyrinths, such as the one that she designed at St.
Andrew's, Cain favors the classic seven-circle form found in
ancient ruins at Cretan and Celtic sites, which is also the one
preferred by most new agers. Rivaling that design in popularity,
however, and more often used indoors, is an 11-circle labyrinth
based on the one in the nave of 13th-century Chartres cathedral in
France. Inlaid in the stone floor, the 42-square-foot Chartres
labyrinth _ which represents the meandering path of a pilgrim going
to Jerusalem _ has the same dimensions and proportions as the
cathedral's famous rose window.
</P>
<P>
   Although you can't get lost in a labyrinth, they can be hard to
find, even ones that welcome the public. For instance, there is an
11-circle Chartres-style labyrinth in St. Paul's Episcopal
Cathedral on Tremont Street in downtown Boston _ painted on the
floor of a lower-level meeting hall that is often covered with
chairs. The labyrinth is reserved exclusively for meditative
walking Mondays from 4 to 6 p.m. and Fridays noon to 2 p.m. but can
also be visited at other times _ provided the hall isn't in use.
</P>
<P>
   Susan McNeill of Leominster has marked out a 20-foot-wide Cretan
labyrinth in purple spray paint on the driveway of her home on West
Street and lets anyone who passes by use it if they want. ``I get
about 10 people a day,'' she says. ``Labyrinths can heal us and
they can heal the earth.''
</P>
<P>
   However, many people consider their labyrinths to be essentially
private places, an extension of home and the family circle. A
dowser and avid gardener, Cherniack picked an inconspicuous site at
the bottom of her garden, away from the street and out of sight of
nearby houses. ``It's also where two energy lines cross,'' she
says.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
A spiritual path
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spiritual the labyrinth may be, but current interest in it has
also created a sort of mini-labyrinth industry. Cain, for instance,
charges $500 plus expenses to design a labyrinth.
</P>
<P>
   The founding mother of the labyrinth movement in America is the
Reverend Lauren Artress of Grace Episcopal Cathedral in San
Francisco, author of ``Walking a Sacred Path _ Rediscovering the
Labyrinth as a Sacred Tool.'' The nonprofit Veriditas Ministry that
Artress founded gives workshops on designing and using labyrinths
and trains facilitators to lead labyrinth meditation walks.
Veriditas also sells do-it-yourself design kits for $125 and
Chartres-size portable three-piece canvas labyrinths, priced at
$3,575.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Artress is organizing a ``global labyrinth
network,'' composed of people around the world who instead of
hoisting glasses of champagne at midnight on New Year's Eve 2000
will walk labyrinths as a gesture of unity with all life on the
planet. The Veriditas Web site (www.gracecathedral.org) lists more
than 100 labyrinths now in the network.
</P>
<P>
   Patti Keeler of Harwich, a Veriditas facilitator who is also a
registered and holistic nurse, has led labyrinth meditations for
hospice patients, senior citizens, community organizations,
schoolchildren, and even corporate executives. ``A labyrinth is
nonhierarchal and provides space for teamwork and community, and
the effect can be similar to that of ropes courses and other
confidence-building programs that executives often go through,''
she says, ``and it's about as metaphorical as you can get for the
way we go along life's path with other people.''
</P>
<P>
   As a seminar project, a group of students at the Cape Cod
Lighthouse Charter School in Orleans recently built an outdoor
labyrinth under Keeler's direction, its path lined with stones and
quahog shells picked up on the beaches of Pleasant Bay. ``It's in a
valley surrounded by woods,'' Keeler says, ``and the entrance faces
the spot where the sun will rise at the summer solstice.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeler says she frequently took the labyrinth-project kids to
the shore, drew a seven-circle design on the sand, and let them
play. It was fun, she says, but the children also seemed to
instinctively understand the labyrinth's ancient message. She
recalls the time when one 12-year-old, after running the labyrinth,
turned to her and remarked thoughtfully: ``We've been taught that a
straight line is the shortest distance between two points, but
maybe it isn't always the wisest choice.''

LATEST AUDI GIVES BENZ WAGON A RUN FOR THE MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R. WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Audi is making a strong bid to regain its place in the American
market sunshine, and its latest offering looks like a challenge to
Mercedes-Benz. The 1999 Audi Avant is an all-wheel drive luxury
station wagon that bids to equal at least, perhaps surpass, the
Benz AWD 320E wagon in performance, and undercut it in price by
more than $10,000. To make the point, Audi wheeled its new wagon
into Boston to show it off to the New England Motor Press
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The Avant is the A6 with a wagon body offering versatile
seating/ cargo arrangements and an interior generously trimmed in
wood. Audi does not speak of interior trim so much as of
``atmospheres,'' interior styling arangements on different mood
themes using different woods, varying colors and materials.
</P>
<P>
   The Avant is priced at $36,600 plus $600 delivery vs. $49,250
plus $595. The model shown in Boston came with a few options _
leather, Bose sound _ with a price tag just under $40,000, still a
significant challenge to Mercedes when you remember it's another
luxury German wagon with lots of room and all-wheel drive. Audi was
_ is _ the leader in AWD technology, offering a system that shifts
power between front and rear axles and from side to side on each
axle depending upon where the available traction lies. The only
problem with the Audi system is the overconfidence it may engender.
</P>
<P>
   The engine in the Avcant is 2.771-liter, 200-horsepower,
30-valve V-6 _ you read that right, 30-valve. Each cylinder has
three intake valves, two exhaust valves for maximum breathing
efficiency _ breathing in a gas engine is inhalation of fuel mix,
purging of exhaust from the cylinder.
</P>
<P>
   The transmission is a little different, a Tiptronic five-speed
automatic, just like the high-performance Porsche roadsters. With a
Tiptronic, you may opt for fully automatic gear changes or effect
lightning-fast shifts with the touch of a finger without letting go
of the wheel. Fuel mileage is expected to be around 20 miles per
gallon combined city/highway on average. So, what you have here is
performance car masquerading as a family wagon.
</P>
<P>
   The Avant is a knockout for looks, offers good room fore and aft
but comes with a couple of faults, in this columnist's view. For
openers, the roof rack on this wagon consists of a pair of stylish,
bright-metal rails sans crossbars or rubbing strakes. Cross rails
are optional, Audi explained. In addition, for some reason known
only to Audi, the radio antenna is mounted on the roof _ in the
middle just ahead of the rear hatch. So much for canoes on the roof
_ unless you care to remove the antenna and forgo radio reception,
a fairly easy option to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   A rear-facing child seat is available as an option. Picture the
family that sees the convenience in that trying to find a place for
the luggage that would have gone where the kids are sitting. The
whole arrangment is justified on the basis of `interior
convenience'' _ I see that _ and exterior style. Somehow I would
think the German engineers would be up to the challenge of
designing a rooftop on a wagon that was at once elegant and
supremely utile.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, the Avant retains the red dash illumination, a distinct
inconvenience, sometimes hazard, to the color-perception impaired.
But, the good news is that Audi does intend to change that; 2000
models will add white light but not dispense with the red
altogether. The change, Audi says, should accommodate the
color-impaired.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the A6 winter performance, the Avant has got to be
dynamite in the white stuff. Winter has been conquered; now if only
Audi would pay a bit more attention to where we put the goods of
summer.

   ANTHONY-STANTON (Undated) _ It wasn't until three years after
the first women's rights convention at Seneca Falls, N.Y., in 1848
that Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton met. Yet the
partnership they formed blossomed into an independent women's
rights movement that would eventually win women the right to vote
and set the foundation for 20th-century feminism's critique of
American society. Throughout their decades-long friendship, the two
women maintained an intense and fascinating correspondance. The New
York Times asked three writers to respond to excerpts from a letter
Anthony wrote more than 140 years ago. Anthony's letter to Stanton

Andrew Jackson Davis over the differences between men and women. By

JOHNNY MATHIS SAYS MODERATION KEEPS THE VOICE VELVET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MCCABE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Johnny Mathis &UR;  &LR; says he learned a lot about the virtues of
moderation _ both in food and his professional life _ from local
hero Julia Child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a big fan of hers,'' the velvet-voiced Mathis, 62, said on
the phone from his Hollywood home. ``I cook all my meals. I learned
from my Mom and Dad, who both cooked. Julia pooh-poohs
(eliminating) butter and fat and says that everything in moderation
is fine. A little of everything, she says, but not too much of
anything. The secret is in keeping the balance between doing what I
want to do and what I have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people who love to sing want to be famous. They want
to be big stars,'' said Mathis, who started singing professionally
at 19. ``I don't. I'm shy. I like my life private. I have a
reticent personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Few performers have rivaled Mathis's professional popularity.
Almost 40 years passed between his first hit, in 1955, and his most
recent. ``I know I won't be able to leave here (Cohasset) without
doing some of them, like `Chances Are,' `Misty,' or `The Twelfth of
Never.' I'll do a medley from the Broadway show `Kismet.' I have an
orchestra, and when I'm not singing I like to make sure the music's
pretty. People like to hear the violin, the oboe, the French
horn.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathis says over the years he's seen a lot of performers fritter
away good will with their excesses. ``There's a lot of money. There
are also the pitfalls, the drinks, the rich food. It's easy to
forget what brought you here. Some people want to be famous. Others
want to be good. You can do both. Look at Sinatra. I never met him,
never even shook hands with him, which is unusual in this business.
But I've read a lot of books on him and the only thing I've read
about how he cared for his voice is(chuckle) that five days before
a concert he'd stop drinking and smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Mathis, ``I smoked until I was 25 or 26. I drank wine
until then, not hard liquor. Five years ago I changed my diet
because I had a cholesterol problem. When you get older, you have
to start thinking about what you can get rid of.'' The singer says
he doesn't preach his lifestyle _ ``it's just what suits me.'' And
he concedes he's been lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``My voice was high originally and then it matured and I've had
no problems vocally. I've also been lucky in that people have liked
the sound of my voice. It's pleasing to them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the luck to have a dad who was a big influence. I had a
voice teacher when I was young that gave me lessons free in
exchange for doing chores and housework. I was lucky to be signed
by Columbia, which specialized in middle-of-the-road music, and
then in hooking up with Mitch Miller, who liked me but didn't like
the way I sang and taught me how to sing certain songs. Then I was
lucky enough to decide that this was what I was going to do. Also,
I kept up with my singing lessons. That was important. In the
beginning my teacher said my voice was very delicate and she taught
me how to utilize two of the muscles in it. The voice is like your
body. If you make it strong, there'll be no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathis seems equally fastidious in his approach to performing.
He's on for 2 hours and 15 minutes. A signature of his appearances
is performing for 25 minutes before his opening act ``opens,'' a
practice he began years ago after attending a rock concert at Yale
Bowl in New Haven. A riot ensued after the headline act failed to
appear after several opening acts. ``I like to assure the audience
that I'm here,'' Mathis says.

CITY OF BERKELEY CONSIDERS A 35-HOUR WORK WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SELNA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ Voters in the Bay Area will decide in
November on a measure that would shorten the work week to 35 hours
and provide double-pay for overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The Berkeley city council voted to place the measure on the
November ballot after a small group of activists known as Share the
Work gathered 3,073 signatures from city residents in favor of the
initiative. The council had the option to approve the measure, but
decided to leave the controversial issue up to voters.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Barish, spokeswoman for the California Federation of
Labor, said that she had not heard of any city that had legislated
a shorter work week than is mandated by the state. And there is
some question as to whether the initiative would hold up to legal
scrutiny if passed by voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first problem would be that the California Constitution
gives authority to regulate labor laws to the Industrial Welfare
Commission,'' said San Francisco labor lawyer Matthew Righetti.
``Any municipal decision is preempted by the commission, which has
set the work week at 40 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Righetti said that the commission is composed of citizens
appointed by the governor and the Legislature and meets
periodically to review and decide labor laws and policy.
</P>
<P>
   Berkeley Mayor Shirley Dean and several council members
expressed concern that, if passed, the petition would hurt city
revenues and business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anyone on on the council who was in favor of this
measure,'' said council member Kriss Worthington. The measure
ignores the fact that most of the big businesses in the Bay Area
where employees work very long hours and overtime are outside of
Berkeley, he added.
</P>
<P>
   While Worthington said he is in favor of a shorter work week, he
believes the initiative is too harsh because it would deny a
business license to any employer who chose not to comply with the
35-hour restriction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Progressive voters in Berkeley will not be deceived by an
illusory measure that is counterproductive and devisive,''
Worthington said. ``This (intiative) has two chances of passing _
slim and none.''
</P>
<P>
   The initiative would require the same weekly pay for 35 hours as
workers received in September 1997 for 40 hours, and all overtime
work would be voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   A city staff report said city services would have to be reduced
by at least 12 percent to pay the increased city-employee overtime
estimated to be at least $17 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the amount of money (that the city would pay in
overtime and more workers) the cuts would happen all over,
including police and fire,'' said Phil Kamlarz, assistant city
manager. ``But we think people will vote against it once they know
the repercussions.''
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the initiative said that the shorter work week and
higher overtime rate will help reduce unemployment by creating a
need for more workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of people working 70 hours a week, let's give some
other people the work,'' said Crisley Bauer, who helped gather
signatures for the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Although unemployment is reported to be lower than it has been
in years _ about 3.5 percent in Berkeley _ Bauer said Share the
Work believes that there is more unemployment than is reported by
the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long-term temps are not counted as unemployed and people who
have been out of work for a long period are not counted either,''
Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Berkeley Chamber of Commerce is concerned that the measure
would hurt businesses in Berkeley and would not ultimately supply
many news jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Businesses will leave and go somewhere else,'' said Berkeley
Chamber CEO Rachel Rupert.
</P>
<P>
   Rupert also said that the measure could not be imposed on
UC-Berkeley, the city's largest employer.
</P>
<P>
   ``UC would be exempt because they are governed by the laws of
the state, so this is not going to effect them,'' Rupert said.
UC-Berkeley employs 11,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Rupert said the chamber plans to study the issue and attempt to
educate Berkeley voters about its pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``No study has looked into the qualifications of those who are
unemployed and how well they might match up with the businesses in
the city,'' Rupert said.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, July 19, will move Saturday in the `a' category.
</P>
<P>
   MIDDLE-CLASS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Something is wrong. For all its
vaunted importance as the chief beneficiary of American life, the
middle class is finishing last in the current economic boom.
Graphic. By Louis Uchitelle.
</P>
<P>
   ENGLIGH-POPULARITY-REVIEW (Undated) _ To be sure, Europeans are
not about to give up their native tongues. But the trend toward
using English runs deep and not just among globetrotting
executives. Europe is uniting rapidly, as the adoption of the euro
shows, and Europeans recognize that in a world of collapsing
distances and borders, English is the language that the Old
Continent, like its infant central bank, uses to communicate. By
John Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS-NAMES-REVIEW (Undated) _ The age of the mundane monicker
is over. How else to explain the Florida BeachDogs of the
Continental Basketball Association, or minor league baseball's
Everett (Wash.) AquaSox? By Alan Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   MACAO-REVIEW (Macao) _ Macao is helping Hong Kong cope with the
latest of a string of indignities that have befallen the former
British colony in the 12 months since it reverted to China. From
the Asian flu to the bird flu, little has gone right for Hong Kong
under Chinese rule, so with Macao's own handover set for Dec. 20,
1999, people here might be expected to fear for their future. For
the most part, though, the Macanese are welcoming the Chinese with
open arms. Graphic. By Mark Landler.
</P>
<P>
   CHILD-SAFETY-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Justice Department's Office
of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Presvention has a surprise
summer hit: a free publication called ``When Your Child is Missing:
A Family Survival Guide.'' By David Cay Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   NIRELAND-REVIEW (Ballymoney) _ All it takes in Northern Ireland
is a trace of one religious background in people to make them
enemies in the murderous minds of people from the other side. By
Warren Hoge.
</P>
<P>
   CON-JOB-REVIEW (Washington) _ It occurs with alarming frequency
in the United States, but the con job is perhaps the least
prosecuted of all petty crimes. But what happens when the con
artist leaves a few dead bodies buried in a trail of ingenious
scams and old liens? Is that enough to get the attention of the
police? By Don Van Natta Jr.
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH-REFORM-REVIEW (Washington) _ Democrats hope to win back
the House come November in large part by backing a ``patient bill
of rights,'' whose purpose is to compel HMO's to take good, rather
than cheap, care of their members. Last week, Senate Republicans
signed on grudgingly, issuing as less sweeping proposal than the
Democrats'. The two parties, however, remain far apart on one
controversial provision. The Democratic version would enables
workers to sue their HMO if they suffer injury because their plan
refused to cover a physician-prescribed treatment. By Michael
Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
   DEVALUATION-REVIEW (Undated) _ Back in the 1970s, it was
considered a fairly benign cure for recessions and export slumps.
As recently as a year ago, it was the prescription for the excesses
that plagued Thailand and other Pacific Rim economies. Today,
however, it is regarded about as safe as bloodletting, and
countries as disparate as Russia and China are being urged to just
say no. The ``it'' is, of course, devaluation, that mysterious
force of international finance that talking heads on television
never bother to explain or distinguish from depreciation. Graphic.
By Sylvia Nasar.
</P>
<P>
   ZAPRUDER-FILM-REVIEW (Undated) _ For Kennedy assassination
buffs, it was the ultimate collectible. Sure, it had been played
and replayed on television, but the actual raw footage of the
motorcycles swinging into view and the limousines speeding by _
and, of course, the split second that fueled endless conspiracy
theories _ was available only on bootleg copies. Until last week.
By James Barron.
</P>
<P>
   SEX-HARASS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Sexual harassment laws have always
been notoriously confusing, so there was much cheering when the
Supreme Court clarified things by issuing new harassment guidelines
last month. In clarifying matters, however, the Court invited new
kinds of sexual harassment complaints, from people who turned down
sexual advances or felt threatened in the workplace but did not
suffer professional harm and from men and women intimidated by the
behavior of people of the same sex. By Margot Slade.

THE ROAD FROM PAIN TO HOPE MAY BE CALLED HUMOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIQUIU, N.M. _ She doubted that she would live and was sure
she'd never felt anything like the emotional pain that had
extinguished her senses and curled her into a fetal ball of raw
hurt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though Jill is not her real name, that's what I'll call this
remarkably direct, deeply wounded but vibrant woman who is _ thank
God and humor _ on her way to wholeness again. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jill's husband, whom she had loved faithfully for more than 30
years, had found someone else and was _ with no notice, with hardly
a thank you _ leaving. By the time she found out, he'd already
retained a divorce lawyer. She was stunned. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't consent to counseling, but some primal instinct told
her she needed to. She made an appointment and asked her best
friend to drive her there, so unsure of herself was she that she
even doubted her ability to maneuver a car to an office building.
I'll call Jill's friend Ramona. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On their way, they drove by a prison. Ramona, somehow knowing
how to touch Jill's pain, admonished her not to do anything violent
to her husband that would land her in the clink. Ramona knew Jill
was a voracious reader. Indeed, Jill belongs to three book clubs,
and one time _ she swears this is true _ she spent so many hours in
one position (lying on the floor, hand supporting her chin) reading
a book that she required surgery to fix two disks. The surgeon,
amazed, said he planned to write up the case for a medical
journal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As they passed the prison, Ramona explained why Jill should
restrain her instinct to kill the jerk. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``For one thing,'' she said, ``you've already read every book in
that prison. And if I have to come visit you I'm not going to bring
you any new books, and you will be miserable.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So there it was. In the midst of this crisis, Jill smiled at
Ramona. Then she laughed a little. Ramona's humor had broken
through Jill's grief, given her at least the hope of hope,
reconnected her to that place where her senses could work again,
where she could feel something besides pain. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She isn't whole yet. She still cries, is still angry, still _
some days _ wants to drive a stake through the heartless heart of
the man who threw her away like yesterday's omlette. But it's
getting better. And humor is helping. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I suppose I've never doubted that laughter can heal, but I'm
certain I've never had so much proof of it as I saw recently when I
taught a week-long seminar called ``From Pain to Hope Through
Writing'' here at Ghost Ranch, a national Presbyterian conference
center. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I hadn't known what to expect from the dozen or so people who
came to confront their pain and, in a Christian context, search for
hope through writing about it. I knew that writing about pain has
helped me pass through my own shadowed valleys and emerge whole on
the other side. But I wasn't sure whether others would or could
share my experience. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the week unfolded, it became increasingly clear that if any
one thing could point the way out of bleakness _ or at least alert
the one in pain that the hurt wouldn't last forever _ it was
humor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another woman here _ I'll call her Jean _ is an accomplished
writer and lay preacher. But she had never tried to write about one
of the oldest, most intense aches of her life, an abusive mother
who, with a slashing belt, would make blood run down Jean's little
girl legs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So Jean screwed up her courage and wrote an account that she
shared privately with another class member, who had the wisdom to
recognize that the writing had healed almost nothing, had simply
recounted the pain. It contained no hope. And she saw why: It
contained no humor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don't rewrite it, she told Jean. Start over. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So Jean began again. And this time there was wit. This time
there was a little girl leaping with astonishing agility over
couches and under beds to escape her furious mother, outrunning the
rage until her mother wore out. This time there was more than a
victim in the story, there was a tiny heroine who knew in her
heart's deepest hiding place that she would survive and, one day,
become whole. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Verse four of chapter three of Ecclesiastes in the Hebrew
Scriptures tells us there is both a time to weep and a time to
laugh. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What it does not say is that often they are the same time, often
(maybe always) the path of laughter is the only way through rage. I
know that's true because I have witnessed it. And it filled my eyes
with tears. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &HT;    Kid scores off McGwire homerun
 &HT;    By Sean McClelland
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Like thousands of other kids, 12-year-old Nathan
Adams of Oakwood arrived at Busch Stadium in St. Louis last Sunday,
July 12, hoping for a souvenir.
</P>
<P>
   He left with the ball that became Mark McGwire's 39th home run.
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning, McGwire couldn't quite reach the left field
bleachers, where Adams sat. The ball landed in the Houston Astros
bullpen, then bounced onto the field, where an Astro gloved it and
flipped it into the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   As Adams reached for the ball, so did an adult fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened was, my cousin knocked the ball down with his
cap, trying to catch it,'' said Nathan, who attended the game with
his mom, a couple of aunts and several cousins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bounced between a guy and myself. The guy grabbed it pretty
much at the same time I did. He let it go. It was really nice of
him to do that, because it's not every day you catch Mark McGwire's
39th home run. I looked at it for a couple of seconds. I had this
amazed look on my face.''
</P>
<P>
   And he had his souvenir.
</P>
<P>
   ``My cousins were all over it,'' Nathan said. ``They were
rubbing the ball, saying they'll catch one, too, if they could get
magic Mark McGwire dust on their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire hit No. 40 later in the game, but nobody in the Adams
family went home with it. Nathan, who was in St. Louis visiting
family, said he ``follows baseball a lot'' and roots for the Reds.
``I guess now I'm just a bigger McGwire fan than I was before.''

 &HT;    New Orleans GM hired for job with new Round Rock team
 &HT;    By Christian Davenport
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ Jay Miller, the general manager of the
Houston Astros' Triple- A affiliate in New Orleans, will assume the
same position with the minor-league baseball team Nolan Ryan wants
to move to Round Rock, Reid Ryan said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at the end of this season, Miller, 39, will become the
GM of the Jackson Generals, the Astros' Double-A affiliate, which
is expected to move to Round Rock for the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, known for outrageous promotions designed to draw people
to the ballpark, has been the general manager for the New Orleans
Zephyrs for the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   Minor-league GMs typically are in charge of the team's
day-to-day operations, promotions and marketing. They do not decide
which players are promoted to the major leagues; that is up to the
parent organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get to know me, you'll see I do a lot of crazy
things,'' Miller said recently at Nelson W. Wolff Stadium, where
the Generals were playing the San Antonio Missions.
</P>
<P>
   In New Orleans every Friday there are fireworks, and Thursday is
dollar beer and band nights, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll tailor the antics to the community,'' he said. ``New
Orleans is a party town. But basically my job is to get people into
the ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Miller's successful ploys this year is to arrange a
wedding between the team's mascots on Aug. 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game is already sold out,'' Miller said. ``The people like
our mascots better than our players.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Zephyrs' attendance jumped to 507,162 from
180,485 the year before, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Before he went to New Orleans, Miller was director of customer
relations for the Texas Rangers, a job, which, as he put it, meant
his main responsibility was basically making sure fans had a good
time.
</P>
<P>
   That's where he met the Ryans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever we needed tickets to the Rangers game when my Dad was
pitching, Jay would take care of us,'' Reid Ryan said. ``He knows
how to make fans feel special. Whether it's the guy with the $2
ticket in the bleachers or someone who owns a suite, he treats
everyone the same.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1989 to 1993, Miller was the Rangers' director of stadium
administration, in charge of stadium and ticket operations and
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he would spend most of his time in Round Rock next
year, and assign his assistant to run things in Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to concentrate on Round Rock,'' he said.

 &HT;    SWT athletic director Alden leaves for Missouri
 &HT;    By Randy Riggs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Alden isn't certain he would be the University of
Missouri's new athletic director if not for DeLoss Dodds.
</P>
<P>
   Alden, the Southwest Texas State athletic director who was
introduced as the Tigers' AD, said he thinks Dodds, the University
of Texas athletic director, played a pivotal but discreet role in
his landing the job. Dodds is close friends with Chuck Neinas, who
served as a head-hunter to Missouri in its search for the successor
to Joe Castiglione, who resigned in April to become AD at Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd talked to DeLoss when the (Missouri) job opened and he
said it was a good job,'' Alden said. ``He asked me if I was
interested and I said yes. Then not long after that, Chuck called.
So I think DeLoss played a role in this, absolutely. He's been a
real good adviser and acquaintance.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodds was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Alden, 40, who in only two years at SWT helped reverse the
athletic financial fortunes of the Southland Conference school in
San Marcos, will take over at Missouri on Aug. 15.
</P>
<P>
   After arriving at SWT from the University of New Mexico, where
he was an associate AD for development for four years, Alden helped
revive Bobcat athletics. This fiscal year, which ends in August,
will see earned income hit about $1 million, nearly double from the
previous year. The Bobcat Club booster organization set a
membership record this year of 635, surpassing the previous high of
605 set 15 years ago. Improvements are being made to various
athletic facilities, and there are plans for a new facility to
house staff offices, locker rooms, a weight room and additional
training rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish he were staying,'' said Dr. James Studer, who oversees
SWT athletics as the school's vice president of student affairs.
``Those two years went by quickly, but Mike accomplished a lot in
those two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Studer said the search for Alden's successor will begin
immediately. ``I think it's reasonable we could have someone by
late December or early January, maybe sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The main disappointment for me is having to put off fund
raising until we get a new director on board,'' Studer added. ``I
was really hoping we could keep Mike. I thought it was reasonable
he could be with us for four or five years, but when we have the
kind of immediate success we had with him, it's natural people are
going to come calling.''
</P>
<P>
   Alden said he probably still would be SWT's fifth AD if it
hadn't been the Missouri job that opened. Alden's father lives on a
farm , 30 miles from Missouri's main campus in Columbia, on land
Alden's grandfather bought 52 years ago. An uncle lives in
Columbia, and Alden's brother is the head of a hospital emergency
room in Mexico, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it hadn't been Missouri, I wouldn't be looking to go
anywhere. But it was just too much to pass up,'' said Alden, a
Chicago native. ``Southwest Texas gave me a great opportunity. The
people there have been good to me. It's been a great place to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   While Alden's new job is a considerable step up in visibility
and prestige, he inherits many problems similar to those he faced
at SWT. Missouri ranks 11th in the Big 12 in athletic budget ($13.7
million annually) and has a full-time athletic staff of about 80,
which is low by NCAA Division I standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are similarities between the problems at Missouri and
the ones we had at SWT when we got there,'' Alden said. ``They're
just on a grander scale at Missouri.''

 &HT;    Everyone's atwitter about birdhouses
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Judging from my mail, there has been a sharp upsurge
in the number of homeless birds, giving rise to a new humanitarian
movement called Habitat for Avian-ity.
</P>
<P>
   We have bird bungalows, bird Tudors, bird Cape Cods, bird ranch
houses, bird apartments -- anything that humans enjoy living in --
scaled down and fitted with holes instead of doors. There must also
be a lot of people who must outdo their neighbors by erecting ever
more sumptuous wren palaces, martin high rises and titmouse town
houses.
</P>
<P>
   I have before me now two new birdhouse books from Sterling,
which seems to have hatched quite a few of them. As far as I know,
Sterling is not in business for the benefit of birds, so there must
be a market for these things.
</P>
<P>
   And, setting aside my jaundice for a moment, why not?
Woodworking isn't all serious stuff, although some of these things
look pretty serious. There's no reason not to build birdhouses and
have fun doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Painted Birdhouses'' is a $25 hardback authored not by a
person but by a thing, called Plaid. I assume this is a magazine of
some sort, but I find no elaboration beyond references to Plaid
Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   It contains 29 projects, few of which, surprisingly enough, are
actually birdhouses. There are birdhouse lamps, one of them with
matching curtainholders, a mawkish ``Bless our Nest Chest'' whose
only claim to avian residency appears to be the birdhouses painted
on it, and a lap desk with the same distinction. There are buckets
with birdhouses painted on them, T-shirts emblazoned with
birdhouses, and for all I know, birds wearing T-shirts. Suffice it
to say there is not much in here for woodworkers.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point is ``The Ultimate Birdhouse Book,'' a
paperbound version of a previously published collection of 40
birdhouses, nearly all actually intended to house birds, and many
of them nicer than the birds around my place deserve. Most are made
of wood, although there are a few gourds in the mix. At $14.95 it's
half the price of ``Painted Birdhouses'' and worth twice as much.
</P>
<P>
   More to the taste of the hardcore woodworker, but still with
plenty of playfulness, is ``Making Wood Handles, Hinges and
Knobs,'' by British woodworker-authors lan and Gill Bridgewater. As
far as I know, this is the first book devoted to hinges and pulls.
There are half a dozen handles, seven knobs -- most of them, of
course, turned -- five kinds of hinges and five latches and
catches.
</P>
<P>
   All of these are designed and made as free-standing projects;
they are not attached to anything at all, leaving you free to adapt
and adjust their design to whatever project you have in mind. All
of them are handsome, and some quite ingenious.
</P>
<P>
   Also new is another chip carving book by Wayne Barton, this one
a paperbound collection of award-winning designs (``The Art of Chip
Carving,'' $17.95, Sterling). There are some remarkable things
here, including Mickey Hudspeth's turned and carved containers and
Diana Kwan's painted and carved panels, which are astonishing
interpretations of Chinese and Japanese art.

Dodds. Alden, the Southwest Texas State athletic director who was
introduced as the Tigers' AD, said he thinks Dodds, the University
of Texas athletic director, played a pivotal but discreet role in
his landing the job. Dodds is close friends with Chuck Neinas, who
served as a head-hunter to Missouri in its search for the successor
to Joe Castiglione, who resigned in April to become AD at Oklahoma.

 &HT;    GINGRICH BUILDING POTENT POLITICAL OPERATION
 &HT;    By MARK SHERMAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ His opponent has raised no money, he already has $1
million in the bank and he has a list of contributors that would
make other politicians green with envy.
</P>
<P>
   So why does House Speaker Newt Gingrich continue to raise and
spend vast sums of money as he cruises toward re-election?
</P>
<P>
   In reality, while Gingrich is running in Georgia's 6th
Congressional District, he uses his campaign account to fund a
national political operation worthy of a presidential candidate,
replete with a high-priced consultant, costly legal help and
extensive direct mail fund solicitations.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich already has raised $4.8 million and spent $4.6 million
in the past 18 months, far and away the largest totals in the House
of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Consultant Joe Gaylord makes $10,000 a month from Gingrich and
another $3,000 from Gingrich's political action committee, or about
$150,000 a year. He also does consulting work for the National
Republican Congressional Committee, run by Rep. John Linder, a
Gingrich ally and Georgia colleague.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three months, Gingrich has spent $238,000 on
mailings across the country. He reported raising just over a
half-million dollars in the small contributions _ less than $200 _
that direct mail is designed to elicit.
</P>
<P>
   The money comes in handy now, but the ability to tap into a vast
network of contributors might be particularly useful in, say, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say Speaker Gingrich does have presidential ambitions at
some point. Building this kind of network could be very valuable
down the line,'' said Paul Hendrie, a spokesman for the Center for
Responsive Politics, which analyzes political fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Shields, Gingrich's campaign spokesman, said the speaker's
political campaign, formally called Friends of Newt Gingrich, or
FONG, exists solely to help him win re-election in his suburban
Atlanta district.
</P>
<P>
   Gary ``Bats'' Pelphrey, the Democratic candidate in the 6th
district, has yet to report raising any money, but Shields said
Gingrich will be prepared in any event.
</P>
<P>
   ``The liberal labor unions will put together a coordinated
effort to smear the speaker politically,'' Shields predicted.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled the 1996 campaign, when cookie maker Michael Coles
spent $3.3 million, including $2 million of his own money, in his
failed campaign to unseat Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   But even against a well-financed challenger, Gingrich held a
comfortable edge in money. The speaker collected $6.2 million and
spent nearly $5.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Paying his lawyers has been a steady drain on his campaign
coffers. Gingrich paid the Atlanta firm Arnall, Golden &AMP; Gregory
nearly $250,000 in the past three months.
</P>
<P>
   Shields earlier said he could not list in detail the legal
services, but said Friday that some of the money was paid for
lawyer J. Randolph Evans's work in setting up the payment of the
$300,000 sanction the House imposed on Gingrich for his ethics
violations.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's campaign account is so flush that the speaker
considered using it to pay his penalty. For political reasons,
Gingrich decided to use personal funds.
</P>
<P>
   Evans said last year that the speaker might claim a deduction on
his income taxes for the ethics payments. Asked if Gingrich has, in
fact, claimed a $50,000 deduction for the money he repaid in 1997,
Gingrich spokeswoman Christina Martin responded with a terse, ``No
comment.''
