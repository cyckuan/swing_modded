<HEADLINE> EDS: Adds Details hke101029--Nepal Deputy Speaker Resigns in Parliament Confrontation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Deputy Speaker Lila
Subba Shrestha resigned Saturday to avoid the humiliation of
forced resignation as well as to show her party's resolve to force
the rival speaker out of office.
</P>
<P>
She made the announcement while chairing a Lower House session
to discuss a motion tabled by the opposition against Speaker Ram
Chandra Poudel.
</P>
<P>
The house was also scheduled to discuss a tit-for-tat motion
against her tabled by the ruling parties.
</P>
<P>
The confrontation started in early September over the
controversial Local Autonomy Bill, into which the main opposition
Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML) sought
but failed to add a provision that automatically terminates one's
post if a local elected official defects to another party.
</P>
<P>
The party fears that without the provision, thousands of
local-level party workers may defect to its rival group, the
Communist Party of Nepal (Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML), which broke
away from it in March this year and joined the government in
August.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-ML, on the other hand, wanted to get the bill passed
without the provision in order to win over more workers for the
next general elections due by November 1999.
</P>
<P>
Most of the mayors, deputy mayors, district development
committee chairmen, vice chairmen and members elected from the
CPN-UML during the local elections in May and July last year had
joined the CPN-ML.
</P>
<P>
More local elected officials are said to be willing to join the
CPN-ML, but were waiting for the Local Autonomy Bill to be passed
by parliament.
</P>
<P>
The bill has been pushed through both houses of parliament and
presented to the king for approval.
</P>
<P>
Prior to its passage in the Lower House of parliament on
September 17, the bill met strong opposition from the opposition
MPs. But when the MPs were voicing protest, Speaker Poudel
conducted voice voting on the bill and declared that it had been
passed in the house.
</P>
<P>
Manhandling between MPs of the ruling and opposition parties
ensued. And on September 23, 54 MPs from the CPN-UML and the
National Democratic Party (RPP, Thapa) registered a motion at the
Parliament Secretariat, accusing Poudel who is from the ruling
Nepali Congress (NC) of partisan conduct.
</P>
<P>
The NC and its ruling partner CPN-ML registered the same day a
tit-for-tat motion against Deputy Speaker Shrestha from the
CPN-UML.
</P>
<P>
Announcing that it would not accept the bill, the CPN-UML
refused to compromise and withdraw its motion, and demanded
replaying of the tape recording of the house proceedings on
September 17.
</P>
<P>
The tape was played Friday in the presence of MPs at the
Parliament Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The NC and CPN-ML said the tape showed the allegation of the
opposition was baseless as there was no procedural mistake.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML still refused to accept it, accusing the speaker
and the government of tampering with the tape overnight.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, it issued a whip requiring all of its 49 MPs to
participate in the discussion on the motion and vote for it.
</P>
<P>
But well aware that the deputy speaker is sure to lose her seat
as it cannot muster a two-third majority in the 205-member Lower
House to defeat the motion against her, the CPN-UML directed her
to quit to avoid the humiliation of forced resignation.
</P>
<P>
Speaker Poudel had announced that he would not resign as the
ruling parties have at least 137 seats in the house to guarantee
his clinging to power.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML had threatened to make its lawmakers resign en
masse as an ultimate measure. However, this does not necessarily
mean the end of the majority government.

<HEADLINE> Bioinvasion Threatens Biological Diversity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Bioinvasion, the spread of
exotic species, has become a great threat to world biological
diversity, the Worldwatch Institute, an environmental organization
based here, said Saturday in its study.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held in the institute, Chris Bright,
author of the report entitled "Life of Bounds: bioinvasion in a
borderless world," said that compared to living things, chemical
spills are inert, they cannot reproduce and they tend to dissipate
over time. But when an exotic species establishes a beachhead, it
can proliferate over time and spread to new areas. It can also
adapt -- it tends to get better and better at exploiting an area's
resources, and at suppressing native species.
</P>
<P>
Natural boundaries like mountains, deserts, and ocean currents
used to isolate one ecosystem from another. But trade, travel, and
other human activities are moving more and more organisms around
these boundaries, touching off more and more invasions, said the
study.
</P>
<P>
Bright said that exotics can now be found in most of the
Earth's lake and river systems, along most coastlines, on
virtually all major islands, and scattered throughout all of the
continents including Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
Bioinvasion may lead social menace in several ways. In 1991 for
example, epidemic cholera returned to the Americas, probably via
contaminated ship ballast water released into a Peruvian harbor.
An Atlantic jellyfish provoked the collapse of the fisheries in
the Black Sea. The water hyacinth from South America has done the
same thing in Africa's Lake Victoria.
</P>
<P>
The author said people round the world should take action to
protect the native species from the bioinvasion.

<HEADLINE> Tsohatzopoulos: Military Action Will Be Eventually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos said Saturday that he was optimistic that a NATO
military intervention in Kosovo would be averted even at the last
minute.
</P>
<P>
He said that decisions reached to date concerned the completion
of military preparations with a view to exerting pressure for a
political solution.
</P>
<P>
The minister expressed optimism that logic would prevail before
the final political decision was made for the conversion of such
preparations into military action.
</P>
<P>
While advising coolheadedness, he said that the critical time
limit for any further developments would be early next week.
</P>
<P>
Greece said Friday that it would not use its right to veto if
NATO decided to militarily intervene in Kosovo, but it would not
send troops and airplanes to take part in any military strike.
</P>
<P>
Tsohatzopoulos stressed that those who lived thousands of
kilometers away would not see any of the results of a military
strike, but Greece would be directly affected by the
repercussions.
</P>
<P>
He added that Greece was continuing efforts to help find a
peaceful solution to the Kosovo crisis because a military
intervention would have no positive outcome.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Calls on Teachers to End Strike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi Saturday appealed to teachers nationwide to call off their
October 12.
</P>
<P>
He announced that he "will not accept to be pressurized" to
negotiate with striking teachers who demand that the government
implement its pledges of the 150-200 pay rise for teachers.
</P>
<P>
It was "unrealistic" to force the government to negotiate on
the teachers' pay dispute as the economy could not accommodate it
at the moment, Moi said at the Moi Day celebrations marking his
20-year rule.
</P>
<P>
Once the economy had recovered, salaries of the entire public
service including those of teachers will be reviewed, Moi said.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the 250,000-member Kenya National Union of Teachers
(KNUT) warned of a long teachers strike if the government rejects
any dialog with the teachers.
</P>
<P>
"There is no solution in sight. And we are not breaking the
strike. The strike is effective and it will continue," KNUT
Secretary-General Ambrose Adongo said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government signed the pay rise agreement last
December just before the second multi-party general elections
held at the end of that month.
</P>
<P>
Teachers' salaries range from 2,700 Shillings to 29,000
Shillings (45 to 480 U.S. Dollars) a month, relatively higher
than most other civil servants in the east African country.

<P>
BONN, October 10 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel Saturday said that he was shocked at an Iranian appeal
court's ruling to uphold the death sentence passed on a German
businessman for having sexual relations with a Moslem woman.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Saturday in Bonn, Kinkel said that the
decision made by the Iranian court went against all expectations
of the German government, which has been trying to negotiate an
acquittal for the 56-year-old German businessman identified as
Helmut Hofer.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel also said he had summoned the Iranian ambassador to the
German Foreign Ministry to receive a formal protest from Bonn.
</P>
<P>
"Today's confirmation of the death sentence against Helmut
Hofer will inevitably cast a shadow over the wish of both sides to
improve relations," Kinkel said.
</P>
<P>
Hofer's defense lawyer also announced that he would appeal
again to the Iranian highest court against the death penalty which
was first handed down by an Iranian court at the end of January.

<HEADLINE> MSF-Spain Ordered to Stop Medical Work in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Faction leader Ali Mahdi
Mohamed has informed the international aid agency of MSF-Spain it
cannot be trusted for the treatment of cholera in the Somali
capital Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
In a letter recently sent to the offices of the European Union
and the Somali Health Sector Coordination Body (SHSCB) in
Nairobi, Ali Mahdi said MSF-Spain is not professionally and
ethically committed to the Treatment Centers of Cholera in
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The letter has also been sent to the offices of MSF-Spain,
World Health Organization, the United Nations Children's Fund and
the governor of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Ali Mahdi accused MSF-Spain of unexpectedly
abandoning its cholera activities in Mogadishu at a time when
hundreds of cholera victims were in the quarantine centers who
died in their dozens due to supply shortages following the
MSF-Spain's evacuation this April.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi has informed the agency that for this he will not
trust the MSF-Spain for the management of the cholera treatment
centers of Mogadishu this year and therefore urged the other
international NGOs to step in to take its place while vowing to
provide maximum collaboration for them.
</P>
<P>
Since the epidemic disease of cholera breaks out in Somalia
every last quarter of the year, the aid agency of MSF-Spain was
all the time in the past entrusted to handle the management of
cholera cases.
</P>
<P>
It is not known what has brought about these crises between
Ali Mahdi's faction and the local health authority on one side
and the MSF-Spain on the other. However, people know that
MSF-Spain has pull its expatriates out of Mogadishu along with
the other aid agencies following the nine-day-long abduction of
the 10 Red Cross staff members in April.
</P>
<P>
This letter came also at a time when new preparations are
being taken against the possible outbreak of cholera.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho King Asks Supporters to Leave Royal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho King Letsie III
Saturday appealed to opposition party supporters gathered at the
grounds of the royal palace in Maseru, capital of Lesotho, to
disperse and go home peacefully.
</P>
<P>
In a public address delivered on state radio monitored here,
the king stressed the need for Lesotho's politicians to put aside
their differences and to place the interests of the country and
its people above all.
</P>
<P>
The opposition supporters have been camping at the royal
palace since early August as part of a determined protest against
the country's May 23 general election, which, they claimed, was
rigged in favor of the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy.
</P>
<P>
Letsie appealed to political leaders to ask their supporters
to refrain from protest action that would heighten the already
volatile situation in Lesotho, saying: "they should stop making
any provocative statements."
</P>
<P>
"I want to repeat that the best way of resolving problems is
through negotiations," he said, noting the last two sets of
face-to-face talks between the country's rival parties were a
positive sign.
</P>
<P>
The king said he was hopeful that the next round of these
talks, scheduled for Wednesday, would enhance efforts to bring
peace and stability to the mountain kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Letsie also extended his condolences to the families of
Lesotho and South African soldiers and civilians killed during
skirmishes which followed a Southern African Development
Community (SADC) intervention in late September.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen Lesotho soldiers and eight South African army men
died in gun battles when the SADC force intervened in Lesotho in
an effort to prevent what was termed a coup in the making.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Greece Anxious Over Israeli-Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and Greece expressed
their anxiety over military cooperation between Israel and Turkey
on Saturday, despite Israel's promise that such ties harm no one.
</P>
<P>
The anxiety was first expressed by Cypriot Speaker of the House
of Representatives Spyros Kyprianou in his opening address to a
one-day conference on "Greece-Cyprus-Israel: The New Challenges
for Regional Cooperation," organized by the Cyprus Research Center
(KYKEM) in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
"Relations between Israel and Cyprus have improved to such a
great extent" that Israeli President Ezer Weizman will visit
Cyprus early next month while the Israeli Knesset (parliament)
Speaker Dan Tichon invited Kyprianou to pay a visit to Israel, the
house speaker said.
</P>
<P>
However, Kyprianou expressed the "anxiety of the people of
Cyprus" in relation to the military agreements between Israel and
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Noting that he has had some explanation from the Israeli
government over the military agreements, he said, "to be honest, I
am not satisfied."
</P>
<P>
"One can not ignore the fact that Israel is providing Turkey
with high technology in the field of armaments," he said.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Greek Ambassador to Cyprus Kyriakos Rodousakis
told delegates that while Greece did not doubt the assurances of
the Israeli government, "we do not rely on the good intention and
good will of Turkey."
</P>
<P>
He said the Israel-Turkey military agreement is encouraging
particularly the intransigence of Ankara toward Greece and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Ambassador to Cyprus Shemi Tzur, in his
speech, clarified that the Turkish-Israeli military cooperation
"is not a military alliance."
</P>
<P>
"It is not an agreement aimed at harming either Cyprus, or
Greece or any other third party," Tzur said, adding "Israel wants
to see a solution to the Cyprus problem. Israel always supported
more international effort to enhance stability in the Eastern
Mediterranean and will not take any measures to jeopardize that
effort."
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the Israeli ambassador said his country believes
that peace and stability among Cyprus, Greece and Turkey will
contribute to a comprehensive peace in the Eastern Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel have enjoyed close military ties since 1996
when they signed two military cooperation agreements. But they
have triggered strong criticism from Turkey's neighbors,

<HEADLINE> Congo (K) Accuses Burundi of Backing Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Kinshasa Saturday accused
Burundi of joining Rwanda and Uganda in supporting rebels
fighting to oust President Laurent Kabila, a report reaching here
said.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi were helping ethnic Tutsis
spearheading the rebellion to set up a Tutsi homeland in east
Congo (K), Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo was quoted as telling
a news conference in the Congo capital Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
"It is a fact. The Burundians are completely involved," Mwenze
said, adding that Kinshasa had reports of many trucks crossing
the border from Burundi.
</P>
<P>
"The reports concerning the mass movement also mention the
constitution of an autonomous Banyamulenge (Congolese Tutsi) army
there which is receiving weapons from Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda
to protect the territory they are setting up," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the reports indicated trucks owned by the
U.N. and other international non-governmental agencies were also
being used to ferry Burundian Tutsis into the Democratic Republic
of Congo (DPC).
</P>
<P>
The Nucleus of the planned Tutsi homeland was in Uvira, a
bastion of Banyamulenge Tutsis who spearheaded the rebellion in
Kabila's army that has spread to become a widening regional
conflict, Mwenze charged.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that Tutsis were being brought to Uvira from the
Congolese towns of Moba, Kalemie and Fizi and from Burundi and
Rwanda, describing any planned Tutsisland as "a permanent danger"
and a potential launchpad for attacks on Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Chad intervene in Congo on
behalf of Kabila while Sudan denied having troops in Congo.
</P>
<P>
Uganda admitted having soldiers in Congo to fight its own
rebels while Rwanda denied direct involvement. It is the first
time Congo accused Burundi of involving in the rebellion.
</P>
<P>
Tutsi-led rebels launched a revolt on August 2 in the east
after Kabila kicked out Rwandan troops who had helped him topple
late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in May last year.
</P>
<P>
Rebels hold most major towns in the east, especially those
bordering Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi, and Congo's third city of
Kisangani in the northeast.
</P>
<P>
Clashes have been reported in the past few days in Kindu, a
government major forward base in the east, and Kinshasa said
Friday the loyalists had the upper hand on the battlefield and
that the rebels had been pushed back to Kalima, about 80 km
northeast of Kindu.
</P>
<P>
Mwenze said army chiefs were drawing up plans for a promised
government counter-offensive to take back rebel-held towns in the
east.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Doubts Israel's Willingness for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 10 (Xinhua) -- One day after the Israeli hero
in a number of wars with Arabs Ariel Sharon was appointed as
foreign minister, Lebanon Saturday expressed shock and suspicion
about the Jewish state's willingness to achieve peace in the
region.
</P>
<P>
"Naming Sharon as foreign minister makes Lebanon and other
Arab countries to ask if Israel wants to make peace or not,"
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri said in an interview with
Lebanon's Orient radio.
</P>
<P>
The 70-year-old Sharon was Israeli defense minister during the
Israeli second invasion of Lebanon in 1982.
</P>
<P>
He was forced to quit a year later after an Israeli inquiry
found him responsible for the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian
refugees in Beirut's Sabra and Chatila camps by Israeli-allied
Christian Lebanese militiamen.
</P>
<P>
Hariri said that the appointment of Sharon reflected the
Israeli government's determination to continue its intransigence
during the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim to protect its north from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
But heavy casualties of Israeli troops in the border enclave
have forced Israel into considering withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, Israel offered to pull out its troops
from south Lebanon in return for Lebanese government's security
guarantees for its north.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon rejected the proposal, asking Israel to fully comply
with the United Nations Resolution 425 which calls on Israel to
withdraw from Lebanon without any conditions.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Representative to Have Talks With UN Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 10 (Xinhua) -- A representative of the
Afghan Taliban militia arrived here Saturday night for talks with
visiting the U.N. Secretary General's Special Envoy Lakhdar
Brahimi.
</P>
<P>
Maulvi Wakil Ahmed Mutawakil, the senior advisor to Taliban
supreme leader Mulla Omar, met Pakistani officials and discussed
with them matters relating to the mission of the special envoy
shortly after his arrival, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, Maulvi Mutawakil will renew Mulla
Omar's invitation to Brahimi to visit the war-torn Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi arrived here Thursday night from Tehran, accompanied by
the representative of the Organization of the Islamic Conference,
Ibrahim Bakar, on the second leg of their mission to reduce
tension between Iran and the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival here, Brahimi told the press that he had
received Mulla Omar's invitation but he could not go to
Afghanistan because of security reasons.
</P>
<P>
The sources disclosed that Maulvi Mutawakil said on Friday the
Taliban had extended an invitation to Brahimi to visit Afghanistan
for talks with Taliban leaders inside the country instead of
Islamabad and were waiting for his response.
</P>
<P>
It is part of the U.N. envoy's mission to visit Afghanistan and
hold talks with Taliban leaders on Iran-Taliban tension, Maulvi
Mutawakil said.
</P>
<P>
He added: "It is not the first occasion that Brahimi is
visiting the region. He had visited Afghanistan in the past and we
hope that he will positively respond to our invitation."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. had withdrawn its staff from Kabul a few days before
the U.S. missile strike on alleged bases of Osama Bin Laden in
Khost. One U.N. official was killed in Kabul during the anti-U.S.
demonstration following the strike in August.

ADDIS ABABA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Physical
Society was established here Saturday with an aim to enhance
scientific study and research in this east African country.
</P>
<P>
According to the organizing committee, the society was set up
to consolidate physics education and exchange of scientific
information in the country.
</P>
<P>
It also aims to extend cooperation and communication between
the society and similar national, regional and international
societies.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inaugural meeting at the Addis Ababa
University, Ethiopian Science and Technology Commissioner Asrat
Bulbula said special attention should be given to such societies
as the Ethiopian Physical Society.
</P>
<P>
Habtamu Zewdie, associate dean of the science faculty of the
Addis Ababa University, said the number of physics professionals
in Africa, including Ethiopia, is insignificant because much of
the attention and assistance has been directed to subjects
related to immediate food needs.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano announced Saturday that his government has signed three
agreements here with Portugal.
</P>
<P>
One accord is on debt service postponement of 83.1 million
U.S. Dollars, which is equal to Mozambique's total debt and
interest to Portugal from July 1, 1997 to June 30, 1999, Chissano
made the announcement at a joint press conference here with
Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres.
</P>
<P>
However, the president did not reveal the terms and deadline
of the postponement.
</P>
<P>
Under the second pact, Portugal is to donate 2.53 million
Dollars to Mozambique to help restore the Cuamba-Entrelagos
railway.
</P>
<P>
The 77-km-long railway is in Niassa Province in northern
Mozambique, which is part of the Nacala Development Corridor.
</P>
<P>
The third is a protocol for technical cooperation. Under this
agreement, Portugal will offer Mozambique technical counseling
and vocational training in the financial sector and the customs.
</P>
<P>
Chissano believed that Guterres' visit to Mozambique which
started on October 6 has consolidated the friendly cooperative
relations between the two countries and peoples.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese prime minister concluded his five-day official
visit Saturday with commitment to keeping his country's promise
in relieving Mozambique's debt burden.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan, the
Regent made a call on Saturday for an early lifting of the
eight-year-old U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He made the call at a meeting with Iraqi First Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz which focused on Aziz's recent meetings with
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and other U.N. officials in New
York.
</P>
<P>
Aziz arrived here earlier Saturday on a brief stop after
concluding a 10-day visit to the U.N., where he discussed with
U.N. officials on resuming cooperation with the world body on
inspecting Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
On August 5 this year, Iraq ended its cooperation with the
U.N. weapons inspection team, alleging that team chief Richard
Butler refused to certify that Iraq had destroyed its banned
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Only after the U.N. makes sure that Iraq destroys all its
banned weapons, can the world body lift its sanctions which was
imposed on the country for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Hassan praised Aziz's efforts to settle Iraq's problems with
the world body, Jordan's official news agency, the Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
After his visit to the U.N., Aziz told the press on Friday in
Paris that Iraq still wants to pursue dialog with the U.N. to
resolve the weapons inspection crisis, although he failed to reach
an agreement with Annan on resuming searches of suspected weapon
sites in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Jordan keeps a close eye on the development of the relations
between Iraq and the U.N., because Iraq is the kingdom's sole oil
provider and largest trade partner.

BUCHAREST, October 10 (Xinhua) -- There must be other
constraining measures, apart from the military attacks, to put an
end to the Kosovo crisis, President Petru Lucinschi of the
Republic of Moldova, said here Saturday in his one-day unofficial
visit to Romania.
</P>

Asked about Moldova's position on the Kosovo issue, President

military conflict near our borders," the state news agency Rompres
quoted Lucinschi as saying.
</P>
<P>
In his visit, the Moldovan president had a meeting with his
Romanian counterpart, Emil Constantinescu, with the main subject
on the bilateral relations and the Kosovo problem. The agenda of
the Moldovan president also covered a visit to the International
Bucharest fair TIB'98 Exhibition as well as a launching of his

The Iraqi News Agency INA reported that during the meeting,

When the whole world was condemning India for conducting

Bilateral trade relations between the two countries have been

</P>
<P>
The U.N. clamped comprehensive economic sanctions on Iraq

<P>
Tlass is also deputy prime minister and vice commander of the

Syria's Chief of General Staff of the Armed Forces Ali Aslan

<P>
Saudi First Deputy Prime Minister Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn
Abdul-Aziz has called Syrian President Hafez al-Assad on the phone
and discussed with him the developments of the Syria-Turkey
crisis, according to SANA.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi crown prince expressed appreciation for and
understanding of the Syrian stance of being willing to handle the
dispute with Turkey through dialog and diplomatic efforts.
</P>
<P>
The current tension between Syria and Turkey erupted early this
month, with Turkey accusing Syria of harboring and supporting
militants of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in its
territory, but the Syrian side categorically denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has massed troops along its border with Syria and
threatened to use force to uproot those alleged military training
camps of the PKK inside Syria if Syria does not stop supporting
the Kurdish rebels in 45 days.

<P>
The PKK has been fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey
since 1984.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia on Saturday
expressed congratulation to Yemen on the ruling of international
arbitration on Yemen's right to sovereignty over Hanish
archipelago.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Crown Prince and Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ibn
Abdul-Aziz contacted by telephone on Saturday the Yemeni President
Ali Abdullah Saleh and sent the congratulation, the Saudi Press
Agency (SPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The London-based International Arbitration Committee (IAC)
ruled Friday in favor of Yemen in its dispute with Eritrea over
the Red Sea Islands of Hanish.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah is now spending a private vacation in Hawaii of the
United States.
</P>

During the call, the Crown Prince also reviewed bilateral
relations with the Yemeni President and the latest developments of
the Arab, regional and international arenas, the SPA said. But it
didn't elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and Yemen have their own land disputes. On July
19, a dispute over the Red Sea Island of Duwaima, claimed by both
Riyadh and Sana'a, led to an armed confrontation between the two
Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Since then, several rounds of high-level talks have been held
between Saudi Arabia and Yemen on ways to resolve the crisis
resulting from the armed clashes, which claimed lives of three
Yemeni soldiers .

<P>
CAIRO, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) Secretariat
Saturday expressed welcome to the ruling of international
arbitration on Yemen's right to sovereignty over Hanish
archipelago.
</P>
<P>
AL Assistant Secretary General Hamed Ben Holei said the league
considers such achievement in settling borderline disputes as a
model for solving problems between neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned Egypt's efforts that have contributed to reaching
a satisfactory solution to both parties along with endeavors by
France and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Holei, in the name of the AL Secretariat, congratulated Yemen
and Eritrea for such civilized way of solving borderline problems.
</P>
<P>
The ruling was taken Friday by the London-based International
Court of Arbitration.
</P>
<P>
Yemeni Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-Iryani described the
international arbitration decision to restore the Red Sea Hanish
islands to Yemen's sovereignty as a momentous victory for Yemeni
and Arab diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
In December 1995, the Red Sea navigation movement was at stake
following the flare-up of an acute crisis between Yemen and
Eritrea, with growing fears of a large-scale military
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
In mid-December, the Eritrean troops captured the three Red Sea
islands of Hanish after a war of word with Yemen in which both
countries claimed sovereignty over the strategic islands.
</P>
<P>
After a diplomatic drive, Yemen and Eritrea accepted
international arbitration to decide the ownership of the islands.
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the two countries signed an agreement in Paris in
May 1996 under which they accepted taking the case to London's
International Court of Arbitration.
</P>
<P>
The Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled Friday that the
disputed islands in the Red Sea were partly the sovereign
territory of Yemen and partly the sovereign territory of Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The arbitration decision will be implemented within 90 days. In
a statement issued from its Hague registry, the tribunal awarded
Eritrea the Mohabbakah islands, some of the Haycock Islands and
the South West Rocks. Yemen gained sovereignty of the Zuqar-Hanish
group, the island of Jaba al-Tayr and the Zubayr group.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Spokesman Denies Upholding Death Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi on Saturday denied the report that an
Iranian appeals court has upheld the death sentence on German
businessman Helmut Hofer.
</P>
<P>
"So far no new verdict has been issued on Hofer," the official
news agency IRNA quoted Mohammadi as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the morning daily Iran affiliated to IRNA reported on
Saturday that an Iranian appeals court has upheld the death
sentence on Hofer for having an affair with a Muslim woman.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that Hofer was sentenced to death by a local
court, but after Hofer appealed the verdict, Iran's supreme court
found some problems with verdict and sent back the case to the
original court.
</P>
<P>
The original court removed the problems and returned the case
to the supreme court, he said, some press misunderstood the issue
and termed it as a new verdict on Hofer.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi also said that Hofer's case is ready for the appeals
court to review and Hofer and his lawyer have been informed of
the procedure.
</P>
<P>
Hofer was arrested at Tehran international airport in
September last year with a 26-year-old Iranian woman on grounds
of sexual relations and was sentenced to death by an Iranian
court in January.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Congolese Airliner Downed by Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 10 (Xinhua) -- A Congolese airliner was shot
down by rebels in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) Saturday as it headed for Kinshasa, the capital city in the
southwest of the vast central African country.
</P>
<P>
Reuters quoted Congolese Information Minister Didier Mumengi
as saying the plane was brought down when it took off from Kindu,
where government army and rebels fighting to oust President
Laurent Kabila have been contending for its control.
</P>
<P>
Government sources said the Congolese Airlines (CAL) Boeing
727 was brought down after taking off from Kindu airport, whereas
rebels said they hit the plane as it was coming in to land at
Kindu, according to the Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
There are also conflicting sayings as to how many people were
aboard the plane and their identities.
</P>
<P>
A CAL director said the plane had 38 passengers, who were
mainly women and children, and three crew aboard, and that
rescuers are still checking for survivors.
</P>
<P>
But rebels claimed that more than 40 government soldiers had
been killed in the incident.
</P>
<P>
"Once again the aggressors have attacked a civilian target,"
said Mumengi, who added that this did not mean rebels had taken
control of the airport.
</P>
<P>
So far, no details were given by the government as for when
the plane was hit, neither were the exact casualti.
</P>
<P>
After winning battles on the west of Congo (K) with the aid of
troops from Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia, Kabila's army and its
alliance are now fighting in the east which is the rebels'
stronghold.
</P>
<P>
Kabila now accuses Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi of backing the
Tutsi rebels to fight against his 16-month-old administration.

TEHRAN -- An Iranian student organization has announced a new
award for carrying out the death sentence on British writer Salman
Rushdie, the evening daily Kayhan reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah Students Association announced the award of one
billion rials (about 333,000 U.S. dollars) in a statement to
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi to protest the
government's promise not to carry out the death sentence on
Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
Kayhan said that the members of the central committee of
the association delivered the statement to an official of the
Foreign Ministry. However, it did not mention when the statement
was handed over.
</P>
<P>
The statement expressed regret that Kharrazi promised to his
British counterpart Robin Cook last month in New York that
the Iranian government would not take or support any action to
threaten the life of Rushdie. (Iran-Rushdie-New Award)

TEHRAN -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi

upheld the death sentence on German businessman Helmut Hofer.
</P>
<P>
"So far no new verdict has been issued on Hofer," the official
news agency IRNA quoted Mohammadi as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the morning daily Iran affiliated to IRNA reported on
Saturday that an Iranian appeals court has upheld the death
sentence on Hofer for having an affair with a Muslim woman.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that Hofer was sentenced to death by a local
court, but after Hofer appealed the verdict, Iran's supreme court
found some problems with verdict and sent back the case to the
original court.
</P>
<P>
The original court removed the problems and returned the case
to the supreme court, he said, some press misunderstood the issue
and termed it as a new verdict on Hofer. (Iran-Denial-Verdict)

<HEADLINE> Opposition Wants Summit Outside Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's two opposition
parties have agreed to hold a three-party summit, but only in
places other than Cambodia, according to a joint statement
released by FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) Sunday
evening.
</P>
<P>
"FUNCINPEC and the SRP state their willingness to be
represented by their Presidents at a meeting with the President of
the Cambodian People's Party (CPP), under the chairmanship of King
Norodom Sihanouk, on neutral ground conducive to a fair
negotiation process," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
That is "in the interest of resolving the current impasse in
negotiations among the three parties that won seats in the 1998
National Assembly election, and in hope of furthering the goal of
national reconciliation," it said.
</P>
<P>
However, the two parties stressed that the summit meeting
"should preferably take place in Tokyo. Alternate sites include
Beijing, Paris, or Bangkok, each having its relative merits."
</P>
<P>
"We cannot join a meeting in Cambodia as we will not negotiate
under threat, including the threat of further so-called "attacks"
on Hun Sen, which could bring consequences of the most serious
magnitude," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
King Norodom Sihanouk said earlier in the day that he could not
preside over a summit meeting now because the opposition had yet
to formally put forward their request for such a meeting.
</P>
<P>
The king made the remarks in response to Chea Sim, president of
the CPP, who sent a letter to Sihanouk Saturday asking him to
preside over a summit to help break the political impasse and
hammer out a deal to form a government.
</P>
<P>
"The summit could not be held until they all agree to and ask
me to do so," Sihanouk said.
</P>
<P>
The third round of coalition negotiations between the country's
three political parties collapsed Friday, as the politicians
failed to agree on what to do about a controversial seat
allocation formula.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the multi-party negotiations, however, had
agreed to ask King Sihanouk to preside over a summit to break the
current political deadlock and to form a new government as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
FUNCINPEC leader prince Norodom Ranariddh is still in Bangkok
since he left Siem Reap on September 25, the day after the opening
of the National Assembly. Sam Rainsy left on the same day and is
currently on a tour of the United States and Europe to lobby for
support for the opposition. He is expected to come to Bangkok next
Thursday.

LONDON, October 11 (Xinhua) -- All six U.S. B-52 bombers
touched down in Britain Sunday afternoon in preparation for
possible NATO air strikes against Yugoslav military targets over
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The six bombers landed at Fairford air base near London about
15 minutes apart, starting shortly before midday. The huge bombers
had left American Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana Saturday
evening to make the long flight.
</P>
<P>
Major Robyn Grantham of the U.S. Air Force told British Sky
Television that while the B-52s could carry a series of different
weapons, "they are looking more at the conventional air-launched
cruise missiles" in possible military action in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Defense Secretary George Robertson was
quoted by Sky Television as saying early Sunday the arrival of the
American bombers "is not a token gesture."
</P>
<P>
"There will be a phased series of air attacks on the Yugoslav
military force if he (Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic) does
not comply with the will of the world," Robertson said.

BRUSSELS, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Oscar Camenzind brought home
the first world professional road race title in 47 years for
Switzerland when the cycling race ended in Valkenburg of the
Netherlands on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He finished alone and 23 seconds clear of Belgian Peter Van
Petegem, who beat Italian Michele Bartoli for the bronze in the
258-kilometer event after more than six hours racing in cold and
rain.

<P>
Ferdi Kuebler was the last Swiss professional to win a
professional world road race championship at the Italian town of
Varese in 1951.
</P>
<P>
The professional class was renamed elite two years ago when
Camenzind's team mate Mauro Gianetti was beaten for the gold by
Belgian Johan Museeuw in Lugano.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday Camenzind upset the odds when in the last 11 k
ilometers he escaped from his five co-leaders, who included
pre-race favorites Bartoli, Dutchman Michael Boogerd and American
Lance Armstrong.

Armstrong, who a year ago was battling cancer, finished

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Interviewed on His Visit to Uzbekistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said on Sunday that Uzbekistan plays an important role in the
Central Asian region, and the relationship with Uzbekistan is one
of the directions of priority importance in the politics in the
CIS space.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin told journalists of the Itar-Tass, Zhakhon (Uzbekistan)
and Khabar (Kazakhstan) news agencies before departure to Tashkent
that he attaches great significance to his state visit to
Uzbekistan where he is to sign a package of documents on bilateral
cooperation, including an Agreement and a program of deepening
economic integration between the two counties for a term of ten
years.
</P>
<P>
"We have mutually defined these relations as the relations of
strategic partnership and comprehensive cooperation. These
relations are based not only on long-standing traditions of
friendship, mutual respect and sincere mutual sympathy between the
people of the two countries and close contacts in the economic
field, but on the common vision of many processes under way in the
region and in the world," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the cooperation between Russia and Uzbekistan has
been deepening and becoming more dynamic, recalling the talks with
Uzbek President Islam Karimov in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Yeltsin also admitted that the activities for
the development of interaction in the humanitarian field fall far
short of the specified goals.
</P>
<P>
There are financial and economic difficulties, the Russian
president said, adding that another thing hindering bilateral
relations was slowness and lack of vigor.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Yeltsin said, he intends to discuss with
leaders of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan the situation in Afghanistan
and on the CIS southern borders and he reaffirmed that "Moscow comes
out for political settlement of this problem under the UN
auspices."
</P>
<P>
They will discuss concrete steps taken to neutralize a threat
posed by Afghanistan to the security and stability in the region,
Yeltsin continued.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that "we are for the political settlement of
the Afghan problem under the UN auspices."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin left Moscow for Uzbekistan on a state visit on Sunday
morning.

used catalysts regain over 90 percent of original characteristics.
</P>
<P>
According to the Kuwait News Agency reported (Kuna) Sunday, Mina said the eff
icient method could be used for the catalysts
employed in the hydrogenation of heavy oil by Kuwaiti refineries.
</P>
<P>
The new method resembles removal of oil precipitation by
testing the consumed catalysts and knowing their physical,
chemical and mechanical characteristics, she said. But she did
not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The used catalysts, which are toxic, were kept in special
depots, but this endangers the environment by time because of the
leakage of toxic components to the soil and groundwater.
</P>
<P>
Another method is the extraction of heavy metals from the used
catalysts, she said, but this is no more viable because of the
fall of prices of heavy metals.
</P>
<P>
Mina concluded that the reactivation of lightly polluted
catalysts was the optimum economic investment. This project will
succeed both technically and economically and will put an end to
some current environment problems, she added.

<HEADLINE> China in Support of Small, Medium-sized Enterprise Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANTAI, October 11 (Xinhua ) -- China has introduced
wide-ranging measures to support the development of small- to
medium-sized enterprises and transform them into an important
force for propelling the nation's economic and social progress.
</P>
<P>
Dai Guiying, an official with State Development Planning
Commission, said that the Chinese Government plans to set up a
fair investment and fund-raising system to increase funding
channels for related enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Dai is currently in the port city of Yantai to attend the
ongoing second APEC Small- and Medium-sized Enterprise Technology
Exchange and Exhibition Fair which will run through October 14.
</P>
<P>
The central government will continue to increase funding for
infrastructure construction and basic industries in order to
create an improved environment beneficial to the growth of the
small to medium-sized enterprises, he said, adding that it will
also provide more guidance and help promote the development of
related enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Dai said, the government is revising the "Law on
Rural and Township Industries" and drafting the "Law on
Revitalizing Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises". The new laws
will ensure fair enterprise competition and protect legitimate
rights of small- and medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to encourage the growth of intermediary
organizations serving small- to medium-sized enterprises and
advance the transformation of scientific and technological
achievements into productive forces. China's technological markets
recorded a 1997 business volume of 35 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The nation's 10 registered small- to medium-sized ventures,
which account for 99 percent of the total number of enterprises,
contribute 60 percent of the total industrial output value and 40
percent of pre-tax profits. They also provide 75 percent of the
total number of job opportunities.

<HEADLINE> Turkish, Yugoslav PMs to Discuss Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANTALYA (TURKEY), October 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister
Mesut Yilmaz and his Yugoslav counterpart Momir Bulatovic will
meet later this afternoon to discuss the situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be one of the several important bilateral
contacts before a Balkan summit that is to start in southern
Turkish port city of Antalya Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Yilmaz-Bulatovic meeting is expected to focus on the
Kosovo crisis, which has become more tense following a NATO's
warning of a military strike to force Belgrade to withdraw its
forces from the war-stricken region.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds have died and thousands others been displaced since
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown on
February 28 against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army,
which is fighting to wrest Kosovo province from Serbia, the main
republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
About 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million inhabitants are ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Bulatovic will brief Yilmaz on the latest
developments of the Kosovo crisis and the Yugoslav government's
position on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Turkish Parliament authorized cabinet to send
troops on a possible NATO peacekeeping mission aimed at stopping
the bloody conflicts in the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, which has close ties with ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo, has repeatedly urged the Yugoslav government to take
concrete and effective measures to stop the violence there.
</P>
<P>
Ankara decided last August that Turkey will provide four F-16
fighters if NATO launches air strikes against Yugoslavia's
military targets in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem will also meet his Yugoslav
counterpart Zivadin Jovanovic later.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav delegation arrived here this afternoon for the
Balkan summit.

<HEADLINE> Internet Helps American Find Former China Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Septuagenarian Joseph Ferm and
his wife left Beijing today bound for his childhood home in
Longshan Village in the city of Zhangqiu, east China's Shandong
Province.
</P>
<P>
Olof and Pauline Ferm, his parents, worked and stayed in the
small village between 1928-1936. His father, a Swedish citizen,
opened a village school and his mother, an American, ran a small
clinic. Ferm's two younger brothers and a sister were born in the
village.
</P>
<P>
Ferm and his mother returned to the United States in 1949 and
he himself later worked hard and became a senior engineer at a
California aircraft plant.
</P>
<P>
The elderly American had cherished the fond dream of visiting
his childhood home for decades, but failed to remember the
location of the small Chinese village. Earlier this year, however,
he began searching for information concerning "Lungshan" on the
Internet. He sent an E-Mail massage to the Chinese Business
(Huashang) World" and finally succeeded in his search with the
ensuing help of a Jinan newspaper named "Qilu (Shandong) Evening
News".
</P>
<P>
They arrived in Beijing last Friday to fulfill their
long-cherished dream. "It will be an exciting and unforgetable
journey," said Ferm.
</P>
<P>
Prior to leaving the United States, Ferm purchased a new pair
of glasses to make sure that he would be able to clearly see the
New China.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that small village sits near the Yellow River. "I
remember a nearby old temple housing a number of solemn
sculptures," said Ferm. "I'm going to look for the old gates and
walls, stroll along the sandy beach, sit quietly by the river, and
renew childhood friendships."
</P>
<P>
A host of childhood Chinese friends still remember Ferm. For
example, Zhang Yuheng, 76, recalled pulling the cart and playing
childhood games with Ferm, and Dou Shengwen, also 76, remembered
very clearly when the Ferm's lived in the village. "We had never
before seen car, motorcycle or bicycles like the Ferm's brought to
the village," said Dou.
</P>
<P>
A number of elderly villagers recalled the friendly foreign
family as good neighbors. They also recounted how Ferm's mother
graciously provided medicine to locals suffering from various
illnesses.

<HEADLINE> Shooting Stops Lesotho Ruling Party Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho's Prime Minister
Pakalitha Mosisili and several of his cabinet ministers were
whisked to safety Sunday afternoon following a shooting incident
at a ruling party rally east of Maseru, South African Press
Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The rally of the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD)
came to an abrupt end when an unknown youth shot and injured one
person in the leg.
</P>
<P>
Pandemonium broke out at the rally as the young boy pulled out
his gun and fired a shot, said SAPA.
</P>
<P>
Party supporters scurried for cover with some rushing to
protect Mosisili and his deputy Kelebone Maope.
</P>
<P>
The LCD leadership immediately blamed the political opposition
parties for the shooting incident. They said the youths were sent
to assassinate Mosisili and Maope.
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 supporters, who had turned out to listen to the
LCD leadership, have started dispersing.
</P>
<P>
A group of armed youths were beaten by supporters after being
spotted in the crowd, LCD officials said.
</P>
<P>
The youths are alleged to have been driven to the rally in a
Toyota Venture.
</P>
<P>
One of them was arrested and was being questioned.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance dismissed LCD claims as "nonsensical",
saying they were just a smear campaign against the alliance.
</P>
<P>
"THis is absolute trash. We are not assassins like them and
have sent no one to kill Mosisili and his bunch," alliance
spokesman Vincent Malebo said.

BEIJING, October 11 (Xinhua)-- China's soccer champions Dalian
Wanda denied Saturday the rumors that tens of enterprises are
queuing for an ownership takeover for the Dalian Wanda Group Co
have not yet begun any formal negotiations, according to Sunday's
Wenhui Bao Daily.
</P>
<P>
Dalian Wanda Group,a real estate firm,was seeking a new

transfer since Wanda declared their determination to transfer all
shares."said Huang Ping,the office director of Dalian Wanda
Group.
</P>
<P>
"The reports that we have begun the talks and a dozen of firms
are ready for the takeover are completely unfounded and
baseless."

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Six American B-52 bombers are
arriving in Britain on Sunday in preparation for possible NATO air
strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The first two of the six bombers have landed at Fairford RAF
base in Gloucestershire, 120 km west of London, as U.K. Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook again warned Serbia it is running out of time
over Kosovo, according to a BBC report.
</P>
<P>
The remaining four are due within hours, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The B-52s can carry out bombing missions anywhere in the world
from bases in the United States, but moving six planes to the
U.K. shortens the range and is meant to increase pressure on
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The planes can carry up to 30 tons of bombs and missiles, but
satellite guided cruise missiles are likely to be used. The
U.S. has also sent 13 in-flight refueling tankers to the U.K,
according to BBC.
</P>
<P>
Cook said that every day of delay for Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic was a "lost opportunity," noting that "he is
certainly running out of time."
</P>
<P>
The U.K. foreign secretary said he was "confident" that NATO
would be united over action on Kosovo at its meeting on Monday.

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Forms Complete Education System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 11 (Xinhua) -- China's education sector has
recorded significant progress over the past 20 years and continues
to be a government priority for development, according to the
State Statistics Bureau (SSB).
</P>
<P>
Figures show that China had achieved great successes in
promoting the nine-year compulsory education system, with the
system introduced to 91 percent of its counties by the end of
1997. Primary schools have enrolled nearly 99 percent of the
country's school-age children.
</P>
<P>
Secondary education, especially in terms of professional
training, has boomed over the past two decades. The number of
students receiving professional training in senior high schools
during 1997 hit 10.89 million, up 4.8-fold on 1980 figure.
</P>
<P>
The SSB also reported that a comprehensive system of college
education had been formed, with China's colleges enrolling one
million students in 1997, up 2.5-fold on 1978 figure.
</P>
<P>
Adult educated has also been the subject of rapid growth, with
related institutions graduating approximately 10 million
students. In addition, the national drive to eliminate illiteracy
has been carried out extensively in 13 provinces.
</P>
<P>
However, China's overall education level remains relatively
low, according to the SSB. For example. some relatively poor and
needy areas are trapped in a vicious cycle revolving around the
the lack of qualified personnel. The bureau suggested the
introduction of reforms such as restructuring education
administration mechanisms and improving in teaching methodology.

</P>
<P>
The high-tech industrial park is the fifth of its kind APEC

backing and various preferential policies granted to state-level
high-tech development zones.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Djiboutian Pilot Detained in Somalia for Shipping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 11 (Xinhua) -- A Djiboutian pilot was
detained Saturday in the Somali northeastern port town of Bossaso
for his plane carrying Somali refugees from Yemen.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the local authority of Bossaso said that the
Djiboutian pilot has been detained, accused of bringing Somali
refugees without the consent of the northeastern regional
authorities, said a report reaching here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The pilot has also been accused of bringing Somali refugees
from Yemen and dropping them in Bossaso without the approval of
the local authorities.
</P>
<P>
The Radio station in Galkaio Town, which supports the recently
announced disputed administration of Puntland, reported that the
pilot will be tried by the regional court later Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Puntland authorities said that the pilot has earlier been
warned, but he evidently ignored the warning.
</P>
<P>
The detention of the Djiboutian pilot together with his plane
may not help the already strained relationship between Somalia's
northeastern authorities and the Republic of Djibouti led by
President Hassan Gouled Aptidon, following the abduction of a
commercial vessel from Djibouti by members from the Northeastern
militiamen late September.
</P>
<P>
The militiamen who still hold the vessel "Nur Star" are asking
for a huge ransom of 100,000 U.S. Dollars for the release of the
ship.
</P>
<P>
The elders from the area are working hard for the
unconditional release of the ship.
</P>
<P>
The issue of the repatriation of the Somali refugees from
abroad has especially been high in the northwestern regions of
Somalia now known as the break-away republic of Somaliland.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats from the Scandinavian countries have for several
times dropped Somali refugees from their countries to the
northwestern Somali towns of Hargeysa and Berbera without the
approval of Somaliland authorities in 1995 and 1996, in which the
pilots and planes were detained and fined.

ULAN BATOR, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia is kicking off a
program to revive and boost the country's dairy industry, in a
hope to address domestic needs and increase export earnings.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed "White Revolution," the nine-year national program
effective from this year apparently borrows some of the idea of
India's successful "Green Revolution" starting in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
However, as a top official of the Mongolian Dairy Farmers
Association told the press here in a recent interview, the program
is tailored to tap this inland nation's vast grassland resources.
</P>
<P>
At a price tag of 110 billion togrog (about 129.4 million
U.S. dollars), it will initially involve three to five counties in
each of the 11 participating provinces and then spread nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Together with cash injection from foreign aid resources, and
domestic private and corporate investors, state funding would help
import equipment and technologies for making dairy products.
</P>
<P>
Given the fact that Mongolia has witnessed successive livestock
harvests in recent years, providing enough raw materials for the
industry, a total of 450 diary factories are planned nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Sihanouk Says He Could Not Preside Over Summit Now </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's King Norodom
Sihanouk said on Sunday that he could not preside over a
three-party summit now because the opposition has yet to formally
put forward their request for such a meeting.
</P>
<P>
The king made the remarks in response to Chea Sim, president of
the ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP), who sent a letter to
Sihanouk Saturday asking him to preside over a summit to help
break the political impasse and hammer out a deal to form a
government.
</P>
<P>
"I could not preside over a summit meeting now because I could
not ask Prince Ranariddh, President of FUNCINPEC, and Sam Rainsy,
President of his self-named party to come back from abroad to
participate (in) the summit, and it appears they also did not want
to return now," the king responded.
</P>
<P>
"The summit could not be held until they all agreed to and
asked me to do so," Sihanouk added.
</P>
<P>
The third round of coalition negotiations between the country's
three political parties collapsed Friday after the politicians
failed to agree on what to do about a controversial seat
allocation formula.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the multi-party negotiations, however, agreed
to ask King Sihanouk to preside over a summit aimed at breaking
the current political deadlock and forming a new government as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
FUNCINPEC leader prince Norodom Ranariddh is still in Bangkok
since he left Siem Reap on September 25, the day after the opening
of the National Assembly. Sam Rainsy, who left the country on the
same day, is on a tour of the United States and Europe to lobby
for support for the opposition. He is expected to come to Bangkok
on October 15.
</P>
<P>
Only 25 of the 43 FUNCINPEC Parliamentarians are now in
Cambodia and all the 15 Assembly members from the Sam Rainsy Party
are out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Pledges Smooth Staging of Hockey Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Hockey Federation
(PHF) chief Akhter Rasool Sunday promised that the pullout of
England will not influence the smooth staging of the Champions
Trophy hockey tournament to open on October 31 in Lahore.
</P>
<P>
England, who withdraw from the meet for alleged security
fears, was replaced by South Korea on account of their ranking in
the World Cup held in Holland in May.
</P>
<P>
Fears had been raised over the late laying of the turf in
Lahore, making it dangerous for the players.
</P>
<P>
Rasool dismissed the fear as unfounded and baseless, disputing
that the turf was laid in Holland a week before the world cup and
there were no injuries.
</P>
<P>
The poly grass turf reached Lahore a few days ago and the
laying process will start on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Defending champions Germany, world and Olympic champions
Holland, Commonwealth Games champions Australia, Spain as well as
hosts Pakistan are the other teams taking part in the twentieth
edition of the event.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan will be hosting the annual event for the 10th time,
initiated in 1978 by Pakistan itself with six top world teams
taking part.

<HEADLINE> Commonwealth Lifts Sanctions on Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The Commonwealth Ministerial
Action Group (CMAG) Saturday announced the lifting of sanctions
imposed on Nigeria in 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, the CMAG decided that Nigeria will not be re-admitted
into the Commonwealth until the inauguaration of an elected
civilian president on May 29, 1999, as it was provided by the
current democratization program.
</P>
<P>
The CMAG, comprising foreign ministers of Britain, Canada,
Ghana, jamaica, Malaysia, New Zealand, South Africa and Zimbabwe,
made the decision at its two-day meeting ending Friday in London.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Foreign Minister Ignatius Olisemeka attended the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth in November 1995
after it hanged author Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight minority activists
on murder charges.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth also imposed various sanctions on Nigeria,
including suspending all forms of military co-operation,
restriction of development assistance, banning of sports exchange
and visa restrictions on government officials.
</P>
<P>
The CMAG was established then to monitor Nigeria's human
rights records to decide on further actions, including the total
expulsion of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports reaching here Sunday, Nigerian
foreign minister Olisemeka, while welcoming the CMAG decisions,
expressed reservations about linking's Nigeria's re-admission to
the return of democratic rule.
</P>
<P>
The international community is right to adopt a wait-and-see
attitude towards Nigeria on the issue of re-admission, he said.
But the Nigerian military government led by General Abdulsalami
Abubakar is determined to hand over to a civilian government next
year, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Italy's business and union leaders
urged Saturday the parliament to pass the cabinet's budget
proposal and avoid the risk of a temporary government shut-down.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting here, CGIL Secretary General Sergio Cofferati said
the budget must be passed because temporary shut-down would hurt
the nation in terms of stability and its future capabilities.
</P>
<P>
"In any case," said Giorgio Fossa, president of Confindustria,
is "a dangerous thing when it coincides with the current
international crisis, with a recession on the doorstep."
</P>
<P>
"The budget itself is not that great," Fossa said in his
capacity as head of Italy's industrial employers association, "it
is a normal measure in an extraordinary situation."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some leaders also called for a quick solution to the
current government crisis stemmed from the resignation Friday of
former Prime Minister Romano Prodi.
</P>
<P>
"It is in the interest of the nation that there is an efficient
government as quickly as possible," BNI Chairman Luigi Abete said.
</P>
<P>
Prodi stepped down after losing the vote of confidence at the
lower house of parliament, but has been asked by President Oscar
Scalfaro to head a caretaker government pending his replacement.

</P>
<P>
The Sunday Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- The Ministry of Defence has not bought a signle piece of
British lamb to feed its troops this year, despite the crisis in the

hay and shooting sheep they cannot afford to feed.

<HEADLINE> Rebels in Congo (k) Down Airliner With Over 40 on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 11 (Xinhua)-- Rescuers Sunday are searching
through dense jungle for survivors on a Congolese airliner shot
down by rebels with over 40 passengers and crew on board.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing 727 belonging to the private Congolese Airlines (CAL)
was brought down Saturday around Kindu, a stronghold town of
forces backing President Laurent Kabila of the Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC), said a report reaching here Sunday from Kinshasa,
capital of the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the rebels and government officials
differed on who was on board -- mainly civilians or mainly
soldiers -- and the stage of the plane's flight when it was hit,
apparently by a missile.
</P>
<P>
The rebels warned that they would shoot down any aircraft
trying to land at Kindu Airport.
</P>
<P>
"All planes arriving in Kindu face a major risk of being shot
down," Alexis Tambwe, a senior rebel official, told a late night
news conference in the eastern rebel bastion of Goma.
</P>
<P>
Government and airline officials said the aircraft was brought
down after it took off from Kindu Airport bound for Kinshasa,
while rebels said they hit the plane as it was coming in to land
at Kindu.
</P>
<P>
A CAL director said the plane had 38 passengers and three crew
aboard.
</P>
<P>
the attack marked a sharp escalation in the two-month-old
civil war that has grown into a wider regional conflict
attracting some half a dozen African armies, diplomats in
Kinshasa said.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Didier Mumengi said the plane was hit as
it took off from Kindu, where loyalist troops and rebels opposed
to Kabila have been fighting for control of Kindu for days.
</P>
<P>
"Once again the aggressors have attacked a civilian target,"
added Mumengi. He said, however, that the attack did not mean
that rebels had control of the airport.
</P>
<P>
Kindu is surrounded by tropical rain forest rich in tin
deposits and is some 440 km (275 miles) southwest of Goma.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the CAL Director, Savros Papaioannou, as
saying that the plane apparently was struck by a missile. "We
have no idea of casualties, but a search is in progress for
survivors, if there are any," he said.
</P>
<P>
Airline sources said private airlines, including several
foreign charter outfits, have been playing an important role in
transporting troops and materials for Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Both CAL and the Congolese state carrier LAC have leased
planes in their fleet that are used to ferry troops and war
materials, said the report quoting airline sources.
</P>
<P>
Two leased Boeing 707 cargo planes -- one each for CAL and LAC
-- were seized on the tarmac in Goma at the start of the
rebellion on August 2 and used to transport rebel fighters to the
west of the country.
</P>
<P>
fighting between the ethnic Tutsi rebels and Kabila's forces
is now centred mainly on Kindu.
</P>
<P>
Kabila accuses Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi of invading to
support Congolese Tutsis with origins in Rwanda. Kabila's forces
are being helped by troops from some African countries including
Angola, Zimbabwe and Chad.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Immigration Worst Headache of Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Illegal immigration is one of the
organized crimes disturbing Italy most, Italian Interior Minister
Giorgio Napolitano said Saturday in Trieste.
</P>
<P>
Napolitano made the remarks after some immigrant traffickers
dumped nine children, including three infants, into the sea
Saturday night in Puglia to divert police attention.
</P>
<P>
The children were then rescued by their parents, other adults
and the police patrol boat that was chasing the traffickers.
</P>
<P>
Napolitano made the incident public at a press briefing after
the first meeting of Interior Ministers from the 16 European
countries belonging to the Central European Initiative (CEL).
</P>
<P>
Italy's patrols along the Albanian coast are producing positive
results but "they are not sufficient," said the interior minister.
</P>
<P>
His government would urge Albania "to step-up its police checks
on departing Albanian boats and their owners which might be
attempting to ferry illegal immigrants," he said.

DAR ES SALAAM, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa held talks here Saturday with Leader of the
Congolese rebel movement, Earnest Wamba dia Wamba, on the crisis
in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The details of their talks were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was a fulfillment of a decision made at the
Mauritius summit of the 14-nation Southern African Development
Community (SADC) in September, local media reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted a State House statement as saying that the
delegation of the Congolese Democratic Coalition headed by Wamba
also comprised head of the external relations department, Bizima
Karaha, and other two members, Michael Tshibwabwa and Etienne
Rusamira.
</P>
<P>
At the Mauritius summit, the presidents of Tanzania and Zambia
were charged with the task of contacting the parties who were not
heard at the conference but critical to a solution to the crisis
in the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
In discharging the mission, the two presidents met Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni at Entebbe in southern Uganda on
September 19, and Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu and
Vice-President Paul Kagame the following day in Kigali, the
capital of Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa has informed Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba of his meeting with Wamba and stressed the need for
stepped-up efforts to promote a negotiated settlement of the
Congo crisis, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Wamba, Leader of the Congolese Democratic Coalition, used to
work for the University of Dar es Salaam as a history professor
until he joined the ranks of the rebels against the government of
DRC President Laurent Kabila in early August this year.

Wakeel Ahmed Mutawakil, senior advisor to Mohammad Omar, who
flew into Islamabad Saturday night, delivered Omar's message,
Taliban's chief representative Saeedur Rehman Haqqani told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Haqqani said the Taliban will hold the second round of talks
with brahimi Sunday afternoon and will wait till evening for
Brahimi's response to Omar's message.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi and Ibrahim Baker, assistant General Secretary of OIC,
arrived here on Thursday on the second leg of their mission to
reduce tension between Iran and the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and the Taliban failed till Friday to finalize the
venue for their meeting as Brahimi wanted the Taliban leaders to
come to Islamabad while the Taliban invited the U.N. envoy to
visit Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
A special Pakistani plane brought Mutawakil to Islamabad
Saturday night. He met Pakistani officials in the Foreign Ministry
soon after his arrival and discussed with them matters relating to
the U.N.-OIC mission.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan played a key role to persuade the Taliban leadership
to come to Islamabad to save the U.N.-OIC peace mission from
failure.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi and Baker opened talks Friday with Pakistani officials
and discussed various options to peacefully resolve the dispute
between Iran and the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi's current visit to the region is in the context of
implementing the "Points of Common Understanding" that was reached
during the "Six Plus Two" Foreign Ministers' meeting in New York
on September 21.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of Afghanistan's immediate neighbors plus
the U.S. and Russia evolved "Points of Common Understanding"
which include the cessation of hostilities in Afghanistan and a
number of confidence-building measures to promote the restoration
of durable peace.

JERUSALEM, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat said
Friday that the appointment of Ariel Sharon as Israel's foreign
minister was "a pure Israeli affair." Echoing the view, most
Palestinians were cautious in their reaction to the
appointment. They recalled Sharon's hawkish past, but expressed
hope that he would help the Israeli government carry through its
pledge to withdraw from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The man who stabbed to death an Israeli woman soldier in the
Jordan Valley Friday is probably mentally ill and unconnected to
any terror organization, Israeli security officials said. The
Israeli army is continuing to maintain an increased presence in
the West Bank, fearing further attacks against soldiers and
settlers.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli currency shekel recovered some of its losses
Friday with the exchange rate being set at 4.26 shekels against
the dollar, compared with 4.311 shekels per dollar
Thursday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the
shekel would be stablized since the economy "is strong."

<P>
MANILA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada left here Sunday for a four-day state visit to Singapore.
</P>
<P>
It is the president's first visit abroad since assuming office
on June 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
In his departure statement at Manila international airport,
Estrada said that he looks forward to laying down the foundation
for stronger bilateral relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Singapore has been a close neighbor and a strong economic
partner of the Philippines," he said. "It has withstood the
current economic crisis in Asia in a remarkable manner because of
its sound fundamentals and strong institutions."
</P>
<P>
Estrada said that during the trip, he will enhance the
bilateral relations, especially the economic ties, between the two
countries and attract more investments into the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada is set to meet with Singapore President Ong
Teng Cheong and Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong during his stay in
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Singapore is the Philippines' third trade partner. Due to
disputes over the death by hanging of a Filipino maid in
Singapore, the two nations severed their relations in 1995 and
resumed formal ties early last year.

CANBERRA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Australian Treasurer Peter
Costello Sunday indicated his government's intention to introduce
Goods and Services Tax (GTS) for the 2000 Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Costello said the coalition government, returning for a second
term in last weekend's election, planned to introduce a GST on
July 1, 2000, more than three months before the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The plan upset the Sydney Olympics organizers.

<P>
Michael Knight, Olympics Minister for New South Wales state,
predicted a 110 million dollars (67 million U.S. dollars)
shortfall in the Games budget if the government went back on what

Knight said it would be extremely difficult to run the Games

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Form Expert Panel to Probe Causes of Fish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's Ministry of
Fisheries and Livestock will soon set up a special committee to
inquire into the causes of the recent death of fishes in the Bay
of Bengal, The Independent daily reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The committee is expected to comprise representatives of the
Department of Fisheries (DF), the Marine Fishery Resources Survey
Unit, the Marine Fisheries Research Institute (MFRI) and the
Institute of Marine Biology of the Chittagong University, the
report quoted a high-placed source as saying.
</P>
<P>
Fishes in the Bay of Bengal were behaving strangely for the
past four months and of late a large number of dead fishes was
found floating in the sea.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the DF and MFRI had collected samples of the dead
fishes from the Cox's Bazar area, 314 kilometers southeast of
Dhaka, during the last few days.
</P>
<P>
Initial findings show that the 90 percent of the dead fishes
were small species of marine "poa", a bottom feeder, and "latya",
another bottom feeder, was also found dead in the Bay, he added.
</P>
<P>
Experts dissected the belly of the dead fishes but hardly found
anything that would conclusively prove the cause of their death,
he stated.
</P>
<P>
A Chittagong-based researcher has proposed sending the samples
of dead fish to Thailand for bacteriological tests.
</P>
<P>
Senior DF officials, however, are skeptical about the outcome
of such tests, saying that after death the floating fishes might
be under secondary bacterial attack and thus bacterial tests on
dead fishes might give misleading results.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that death of fishes might have been caused
by physio-chemical factors which should be identified. Excessive
growth of Red-Tid, one specie of plankton that creates shortage of
dissolved oxygen in sea water, might also be a contributing
factor, they added.
</P>
<P>
Some officials feel that the dissolved oxygen content of the
Bay waters might be reduced also by the flushing of huge volume of
flood waters that are washing out agro-chemical residue, and other
toxic wastes from the catchment areas in both India and
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
They are optimistic about the capability of the Institute of
Marine Biology of the Chittagong University to identify the cause
of death of fishes in the Bay.
</P>
<P>
However, either the DF, nor MFRI or the Institute of Marine
Biology has the necessary expertise to test the heavy metal
toxicity that might also be a cause of fish death due to dumping
of toxic wastes by foreign ships, fisheries officials said.
</P>
<P>
Marine fishes account for over 21 percent of the nearly 1.4
million tons of fishes consumed annually in this South Asian
country, according to official figures.

BEIRUT, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Two fighters of Lebanon's
resistance forces were killed late Saturday night in clashes with
Israeli occupation troops in south Lebanon, security sources said
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas of the Hezbollah, or Party of God, were killed
when they were attempting to attack an Israeli post at the village

sources added.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army has confirmed the casualties, Lebanon's Orient

Israel set up the security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 to
protect its northern areas from cross-border attacks by Lebanese
guerrillas. The Jewish state is mired in a war of attrition.

Hezbollah is spearheading a resistance movement aimed at
driving more than 1,000 Israeli troops out of the country.

<HEADLINE>   Peace Guarantors to Propose Ecuador-Peru Border Formula </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the
United States, the guarantor countries for talks on the border
dispute between Ecuador and Peru, on Saturday agreed to work out a
proposal for a border delimitation formula between the two
countries, said the Ecuadoran Foreign Affairs Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The move is in response to a request made this week by
Ecuadoran President Jamil Mahuad and his Peruvian counterpart
Albert Fujimori for a formula by guarantors to determine the
border line between the two countries in unmarked zones.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Mahuad and Fujimori, Brazilian President
Fernando Cardoso, in capacity of coordinator of the guarantors,
reiterated "the willingness of the guarantor countries to
contribute in the present circumstances" to the efforts.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso said the guarantors' proposal would include "the
agreements reached by Ecuador and Peru, and a formula for the
settlement of the matters still pending in relation to the marking
in the common border."
</P>
<P>
The proposal is expected to be submitted to the Ibero-American
Summit to be held on October 17 and 18 in Oporto, Portugal, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Argentine President Carlos Menem and Chilean President Eduardo
Frei will also attend that meeting.
</P>
<P>
Quito and Lima have agreed on a treaty of trade and navigation
in the Amazons River, joint efforts in defending border
integration, the use of a waterway in the Zarumilla River, and
measures to resume mutual confidence.
</P>
<P>
However, they are still bogged down in the border delimitation
dispute, especially in the El Condor mountain range, southeast of
Ecuador, the site of 1981 and 1995 armed conflicts.

The previous weekend reports that Unit Trust of India (UTI),

The BSE sensitive index showed another sharp fall of 185.63
over the week closing at 2916.66 as against last weekend's close
of 3102.29. The national index also downed by 78.73 points to end
the week at 1301.05 from last weekend's close of 1379.78. The
BSE-200 and U.S. dollar index were quoted remarkably lower at
304.24 and 119.58 compared with the previous close of 320.44 and
125.44 respectively.

<HEADLINE> Ecuadoran Former Interim President Put Under Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadoran Anti-Corruption
Committee has started investigations on former Interim President
Fabian Alarcon and some officials on possible misconduct, reports
here said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a recent clearance of accounts, the Ecuadoran government
found that several huge amounts of extra-budgetary funds were
appropriated during the administration of the former interim
government from January 1997 to July 1998.
</P>
<P>
The funds, which totaled more than 940 million U.S. dollars,
were not earmarked for the national priority projects despite
their dire needs of investment, but for some local projects.
</P>
<P>
A report from the Ministry of Finance said all the above
expenditures were endorsed by Alarcon in person and implemented by
former Finance Minister Marco Flores.
</P>
<P>
None of the funds were used according to legal proceedings in
that no receipts or detailed accounts were available for most of
them, the report said. Explanations that were available for
certain funds, however, were not clearly worded.
</P>
<P>
The Anti-Corruption Committee has filed the case for
investigation and issed a summon to Alarcon demanding that he
account for his decision on the disbursements, its justification
and legality as well as their whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in response to requests of some members of
parliament, the Ecuadoran National Parliamentary Investigation
Committee has decided to start its investigation on the case.
</P>
<P>
The committee has notified Alarcon to get ready for queries by
members of parliament when necessary.
</P>
<P>
Observers have noticed that the extra-budgetary funds allegedly
appropriated by the former interim government accounted for 60
percent of the total deficits of the Ecuadoran government, which
stand at 1.4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
If the allegations were confirmed, Alarcon will be sentenced on
charges of abuse of power and embezzlement.

coalition in a move that irritated the TCP which bans its members
from participating in the coalition.
</P>
<P>
The expulsion leaves the TCP with only five Parliament seats,
the second smallest party in the House.
</P>
<P>
TCP leader Samak Sundaravej had engineered the expulsion with
the intention to topple the coalition, since the move would strip
the defectors of their MP status, leading to the coalition to lose
its majority in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
But the expulsion came too late since Chuan boosted the
majority of his coalition by bringing in the National Development
Party last week, making the expulsion irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
The TCP said the defectors had disobeyed an earlier party
resolution against joining the coalition because they wanted
Cabinet positions and other political favors they were promised by
the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
Although it was almost certain that the renegades would lose
their MP status, some legal experts said that under the new
Constitution, they had the right to join another party to keep
their parliamentary seats.
</P>
<P>
The renegades told a press conference after leaving the TCP
headquarters following the expulsion vote that they would appeal
to the Constitution Court.
</P>
<P>
They questioned the procedure leading to their expulsion,
saying the party charter required that the executive committee
cast a confidential vote whereas Samak who chaired the meeting had
asked it to vote openly.
</P>
<P>
The renegades voiced doubt that all of the 54 votes in favor of
their expulsion had been cast by executive members present at the
meeting.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Repays 2.19 Billion U.S. Dollars in Foreign Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela repaid 2.19 billion
U.S. dollars in the first nine months of this year, accounting for
8.76 percent of its total foreign debt, the Central Bank of
Venezuela said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that the country's foreign exchange reserves
dropped by 4.7 billion dollars in the period, of which 2.19
billion were used for the repayment.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, the country's foreign debt climbed to 25
billion dollars and its foreign reserves to a record of 17.82
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government plans to repay 3.83 billion dollars
in foreign debt this year, of which two billion are the principle,
said Director of Coordination and Planning Office for the
Presidency Teodoro Petkoff.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this, the government needs to use 1.64 billion
dollars of its foreign reserves in the fourth quarter of this
year, he added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Int'l Contractor to Enhance Risk Control Means </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 11 (Xinhua) -- China's overseas businesses are
improving their edge in risk control to reduce the impact of
Southeast Asia's financial turmoil on their business, according to
today's Business Weekly of China Daily.
</P>
<P>
"We have strengthened risk management to hedge against risks to
our operations," said Wang Zhendong, president of overseas
operation of the China State Construction Engineering Corp
(CSCEC), China's largest contractor.
</P>
<P>
Contracts claimed by overseas operations this year have fallen
slightly compared with the same period last year due to the slack
international market. However, the turnover will be between 1.8
billion U.S. dollars and 2 billion dollars, possibly making a new
record, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
"We try to set proper bidding prices and ask project owners to
use U.S. dollars as currency to settle accounts if possible," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Many of CSCEC's overseas contracts are "turn-key" projects
involving design and construction, which means a wider profit
margin. Its leaner operation and higher efficiency have also
helped to lower the cost.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months this year, CSCEC received 20 foreign
orders each exceeding 10 million U.S. dollars, of which 15 came
from Asian nations and regions which totalled 1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"It is estimated that we will agree contracts worth 100 million
dollars in North Africa and 30 million dollars in South Africa
this year," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Based on global sales of 4.4 billion dollars, CSCEC was ranked
21st in 1997 among 225 international contractors by the
U.S. Engineering News Record Magazine.
</P>
<P>
However, challenges remains ahead. "Feeble economies in some
Asian nations, high technology content of projects and
protectionism exercised by some foreign countries are requiring
Chinese contractors to deepen corporate reform," said Gao Hucheng,
vice-minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The central government is ready to extend more loan quotas to
contractors and increase the tax rebate rates for equipment to
bolster the sector's growth.

<HEADLINE> China Considers Plans to Transfer Surplus Capacity Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 11 (Xinhua) -- China is drafting a plan that
will encourage sectors suffering from overcapacity to transfer
production abroad, "Business Weekly" of "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
A list covering dozens of products from the light industry,
electronics and machinery sectors is being prepared, the newspaper
quoted an official with the State Economic and Trade Commission as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The commission, in collaboration with other government
agencies, is mulling measures to give companies in these sectors
incentives to make investment overseas, said the official without
elaborating more details.
</P>
<P>
But he said the measures would be integrated with the country's
efforts to upgrade its industrial structure.
</P>
<P>
China's industrial sector has been plagued by redundant
construction, which has resulted in widespread undercutting on the
domestic market and hence calls for setting price floors and
punishment for enterprises that sell their products at lower
prices.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that nearly 500 kinds of products are
manufactured at less than 60 percent of capacity. A large
proportion of those products have technological content and
quality better than similar goods in many developing
countries. Compared with those of developed countries, these
products also have considerable price advantages.
</P>
<P>
There is great potential for these products in international
market, said Xing Houyuan, a trade expert specializing in Chinese
overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
According to her, China can transfer its technologically mature
industries to developing countries in the Middle East, the Gulf
Region, Latin America, Africa and Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese enterprises, such Qingdao-based Haier Group and
Shanghai Radio and TV Co. Ltd., have already made some progress in
this direction.
</P>
<P>
By now, Chinese companies have invested six billion
U.S. dollars in setting up 6,000 business undertakings in 140
countries and regions.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Orders Deployment for Possible Kosovo Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen has ordered the deployment of six B-52 bombers, one
reconnaissance aircraft and 13 tankers to Britain on Saturday for
possible air strikes in Kosovo, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
The planes will be among 260 U.S. aircraft already committed by
the United States to support actions by the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) against Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
Most of the force is already in Europe, either stationed at
bases or aboard the aircraft carrier Dwight D. Eisenhower, which
is currently in the Mediterranean Sea, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon statement announcing the deployment reiterated the
U.S. threat that if Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic fails to
meet with the U.N. demands, "NATO has plans to use force to gain
his compliance by using air strikes that will damage his ability
to conduct military operations."
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who is on a tour in the Gulf region, told a news
conference in the Qatari capital Doha that the B-52s were being
moved so that, if NATO issued an "activation order" in the next
few days, those aircraft could be available for NATO European
commander to use "should he deem it necessary to do so."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 11 (Xinhua) -- A string of recent exploration
breakthroughs in the Tarim Basin suggest that the colossal desert
area in northwest China will become the country's most significant
source of energy supplies in the next century, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The China National Star Petroleum Corp (CNSPC) has recently
announced its discovery of an oilfield with geological reserves
(proven reserves and controlled reserves combined) of over 100
million tons in the Tarim Basin, in northwest China's Uyger
autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
The Tahe Oilfield is located in the Shaya Uplift of the
northern Tarim Basin. Experts attribute the discovery to the new
approaches to explorations applied by the CNSPC.
</P>
<P>
Several international oil giants have contacted the CNSPC and
showed great interest in launching cooperation in the Tarim Basin
since the company's remarkable discovery was publicized, according
to the CNSPC.
</P>
<P>
The China National Petroleum Corp(CNPC), the country's flagship
oil company, has also made several significant findings in the
Tarim Basin recently, according to liang Digang, a ranking
official in the CNPC.
</P>
<P>
A high-yielding gas well named Kela-2 was drilled by the CNPC
in the Kuqa Depression in the northern Tarim Basin. With an oil-
and gas-bearing area of over 40 square kilometres, the Kela-2 gas
field will become the country's largest, with reserves expected to
be over 160 billion cubic metres, liang said.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that over 500 billion cubic metres of natural
gas will be proven in the basin by 2005," he added.
</P>
<P>
The CNPC has also found large amounts of oil resources last
year. The total geological reserves on the northern slope of the
Tazhong Uplift are estimated at over 100 million tons of crude
oil, and the oil reserves in the Lunnan area are also expected to
be over 100 million tons, Liang said.

<P>
TAIYUAN, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Mount Wutai, a famous Buddhist
shrine in north China's Shanxi Province, hosted 525,000 domestic
and foreign tourists in the first eight months of the year.
</P>
<P>
The figure included 5,000 foreign tourists. The rising number
of visitors increased tourism earnings by 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
The local government has not only intensified tourism
promotions both at home and abroad since the first day of the year,
but has also continued an extensive effort to improve
infrastructure. Rising tourism figures readily showed the effectiveness
of related efforts.
</P>
<P>
The local area hosted 3,156 foreign tourists during the Ninth
International Tourism Month from July 25 to August 25, up 15.8
percent on the previous year's period.
</P>
<P>
Mount Wutai, one of China's four sacred Buddhist mountains, is
home to 47 temples, the oldest of which dates back to Tang Dynasty
(618-907).
</P>
<P>
Wutai hosted a total of 600,000 tourists during 1997, with
earnings of 145 million yuan (18 million US dollars) representing
a 20 percent rise on the previous year's period.

<HEADLINE> Leading Chinese TV Tube Plant Enjoys Rising Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, October 11 (Xinhua) -- China's leading color television
tube producer has weathered the financial crisis sweeping
Southeast Asia and enjoyed soaring exports for the first nine
months of the year.
</P>
<P>
The Caihong Color Television Tube Plant located in Xianyang,
Shaanxi Province, produced 4 .79 million units during the
period. Total period sales of 5.37 million units, including units
in inventory, earned profits of 120 million yuan (14.46 million US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The plant, the largest of its kind in China, exported 1.31
million 37-cm tubes, up 22 percent on the previous year's
period. The company also exported 58,500 54-cm tubes, a dramatic
period rise of 400 percent.
</P>
<P>
The plant, China's first television tube manufacturer which
entered operations in the early 1980s, features a state-of-the-art
assembly produced in Japan. Caihong, which ranks first amongst 10
major Chinese television tube producers, has an annual production
capacity of seven million units. The company currently holds a 30
percent share of the domestic market and exports some 33 percent
of total output.
</P>
<P>
However, Caihong has faced severe challenges resulting from the
saturated domestic and international markets, with the worldwide
oversupply reaching 50 million units, including 10 million units
in China alone, and the unit price dropping by as much as 50
percent. The financial crisis in Southeast Asia has further
exacerbated the situation.
</P>
<P>
The company has cut costs to overcome difficulties, with costs
for the first nine months alone falling by 21.2 percent on the
1997 period. The effective program has greatly sharpened the
company's competitive edge. Caihong has also maintained
traditional markets such as Turkey and Hong Kong, and plans to
expand new markets in East Europe and Africa.
</P>
<P>
Caihong's January-September export earnings hit 44 million US
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Turkey and Wales Make Shocks at European Qualifiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and Wales made stunning
appearances at the European Soccer Championships qualifiers on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Turkey sent reigning European champions Germany crashing to a
1-0 defeat in their group three qualifier in Bursa to underline
the deep-rooted problems currently afflicting the German national
side.
</P>
<P>
The other major upset of the night was in Copenhagen where
beleaguered Wales, without star forward Ryan Giggs, were
thoroughly overwhelmed by Denmark for almost their entire group
one match -- but won 2-1 thanks to a superb header four minutes
from time by 19-year-old substitute Craig Bellamy.
</P>
<P>
Those defeats for the last two nations to have been crowned
champions of Europe threw their respective groups wide open --
and put added pressure on new German coach Erich Ribbek and
Danish coach Bo Johannson to get it right when their sides play
Moldova and Switzerland respectively on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Johansson summed up the feelings of a coach who has just
experienced his side do everything but fail to win when he said
afterwards: "It's a nightmare -- but that's life."
</P>
<P>
Turkey, who beat Northern Ireland in their opening group three
match five weeks ago, went to the top of the group thanks to a
header by Hakan Sukur who punished some poor goalkeeping by
Oliver Kahn after 69 minutes of Germany's first qualifying match.
</P>
<P>
Ribbeck, who took over from Berti Vogts as coach last month,
quickly needs to get some injured players fit again -- and build
a new team following the retirement or the fading away of many of
Vogts's old stalwarts.
</P>
<P>
Wales, who lost 2-0 at home to Italy in their opener and have
had a miserable time over the last few years, looked to be
heading to another defeat when Soren Frederiksen put Denmark
ahead after 58 minutes.
</P>
<P>
But they were level through Adrian Williams a minute later
after a goalkeeping blunder by Peter Schmeichel's stand-in Mogens
Krogh -- although Krogh was powerless to stop Bellamy's winning
header close to the end.
</P>
<P>
While those former champions were losing, France showed the
true grit expected of world champions when they came back to beat
Russia 3-2 in Moscow in group four qualifier after letting a
two-goal lead slip from their grasp.
</P>
<P>
France secured their first victory since beating Brazil in the
World Cup Final in July when Alain Boghossian scored the winner
eight minutes from time.
</P>
<P>
Nicolas Anelka (13) and Robert Pires (29) got France away to a
superb start, but Russia rallied with goals from Igor
Yanovsky(45) and Alexander Mostovoi (57) before Boghossian scored
the winner.
</P>
<P>
France could have won by an even bigger margin if Laurent
Blanc had not driven a late penalty against the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
The victory was hugely welcome for the French following a draw
with Iceland in their opening match, but Russia now face a tough
task to qualify after losing both their opening matches to
Ukraine and now France.
</P>
<P>
Croatia, who reached the semi-finals of the World Cup in the
summer, also needed to dig deep into their reserves to overcome a
shock half-time deficit against Malta before winning 4-1.
</P>
<P>
Scotland also showed some rare tenacity by twice coming from
behind to defeat Estonia 3-2 -- but England, hosts of the 1996
European championships and expected to reach the finals again in
2000 had a poor day, being held to a 0-0 drab home draw by
Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
For a while it looked as though Malta were going to pull off a
real upset in Valletta against Croatia in their group eight match
after Hubert Suda put them ahead with a 28th minute penalty.
</P>
<P>
Malta played some attractive football, but eventually were
overrun by the superior Croats who scored through Davor Vugovic
(2), Dario Simic and Davor Suker, the World Cup's top scorer.
</P>
<P>
Scotland ended the worst run of matches without a win in their
international history when they twice came from behind to defeat
Estonia 3-2 in a group nine qualifier at Edinburgh.
</P>
<P>
While Scotland were exalting in a rare victory, their
arch-foes England were playing poorly in a 0-0 draw with Bulgaria
at Wembley.
</P>
<P>
After losing their opening group five match 2-1 in Sweden,
England now face an uphill battle to qualify for the finals in
2000. The result increases the pressure on England coach Glenn
Hoddle, but also did not help Bulgaria's cause much as they also
lost their opening game, 3-0 to Poland last month.
</P>
<P>
However there was also a notable performance by Latvia, who
maintained their 100 percent start in group two with a 1-0 win
over Georgia to ensure they remain in top position in group two.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, however, who stunned Spain 3-2 in their first
game,were brought back to earth by Austria who won with two goals
by Harald Cerny and one from Hannes Reinmayr.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scientists to Conduct Gene Transfer in Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. scientists from the
University of Wisconsin-Madison and Wisconsin Center for Space
Automation and Robotics will conduct on space shuttle Discovery to
be launched on October 29 an experiment whether microgravity can
provide a more efficient environment for gene transfer.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the university, U.S. scientists will
wrap about 1,000 soybean seedlings with water-soaked paper and
place them on the flight.
</P>
<P>
In a technique patented by the University of Toledo
researchers, the plants will have their meristem region damaged
just before launch. The meristem region directs the plant's
diverse growth of roots, stems and leaf cells.
</P>
<P>
This damaged area provides an entry point for the new genetic
information which can be incorporated into the plants. The genes
being introduced in this experiment has immune-strengthening
properties.
</P>
<P>
The process would allow use of soybean material as a source of
medicine to relieve arthritis symptoms.
</P>
<P>
The seedlings will be planted after they return to the ground
and researchers will monitor how many of them have the new trait.

Sunday that the talks between President Slobodan Milosevic and
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke has made a political settlement for
the Kosovo crisis possible.
</P>
<P>
A statement released through the Tanjug news agency following
Holbrooke and Milosevic's seven-hour talks said: "It was agreed
that all necessary conditions exist for the resolution of open
questions through a political process."
</P>
<P>
The statement said, "The demands contained in the U.N. Security
Council Resolution have been realized in practice, which is
evidenced by the accelerated normalization of the situation in the
field."
</P>
<P>
However, there was no immediate comment from Holbrooke on the
statement or the outcome of the talks in a last-ditch effort to
avert a military attack threatened by NATO on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The talks ended after Washington announced its dispatch of B-52
bombers to Britain for a possible attack on Yugoslavia.

RIO DE JANEIRO, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's federal tax
revenue exceeded 8.6 billion U.S. dollars in September, up 8.7
percent over the same month of 1997, official reports said on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, Lytha Spindola, assistant secretary to the Federal
Tax Attorney, said less tax money was collected from certain
sectors, including the industry sector, because of sluggish
production activities.
</P>
<P>
The country's accumulated tax revenue between January and
September amounted to 86.48 billion dollars, a 25-percent increase
over the 69.1 billion dollars for the corresponding period last
year.
</P>
<P>
Brazil is expected to collect an estimated total of 101.694
billion dollars in tax this year, the assistant secretary said.

<HEADLINE> Blair Urges Setting Up of Global Credit Rating System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 10 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair called on the Group of Seven (G7) major industrialized
nations to set up a world "credit rating" system.
</P>
<P>
Blair, whose country is holding the current G7 presidency, told
Britain's Sunday Business newspaper, "What we need is a set of
clear standards that countries sign up to. It's almost like a
credit rating that they have in the international finance system."
</P>
<P>
"Then everyone knows what they are dealing with and they go
into it with their eyes open, recognizing that countries that
don't have those types of open financial systems are countries
that are more risky to do business with," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper, due to be published Sunday, said Blair hoped
that countries would agree to an international code on openness
and transparency at a G7 summit on the global economic crisis to
be held in London later this year.
</P>
<P>
The G7 country comprises the United States, Canada, Britain,
France Italy, Germany and Japan.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economy to Grow by 2 Percent, Says S.F. Fed Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 10 (Xinhua) -- A Federal Reserve Bank
official said U.S. economic growth next year is likely to be "just
under 2 percent," San Francisco Chronicle reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
San Francisco Fed chief Robert Parry said Friday that recent
stock market declines and rising interest rates charged to riskier
borrowers "could put sizable damper" on consumer and business
spending. But disputing suggestions that the United States might
be heading for a recession, he expected slow growth in 1999.
</P>
<P>
By rising interest rates, Parry referred to a sudden major leap
in mortgage rates in this country, nearly a full percentage point
in just the past few days.
</P>
<P>
At the start of the week, American homeowners could have
secured an interest rate as low as 7.25 percent on a 30-year,
fixed-rate no-points conforming loan. Now the rate would be 8.125
percent. On a 200,000-dollar loan, this week's rate increase would
add a 120-dollar per month to the mortgage payments.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the spike to a surge in U.S. Treasury bond
rates, caused by the dollar's fall against the yen. They do not
expect rates to stay high long, given the soft economy worldwide
and the overall trend toward lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Parry gave no clear signal whether the Fed is likely to reduce
interest rates beyond the quarter-percent cut in the federal funds
rate announced last week. The Chronicle quoted him as saying that
"it's too early to speculate" and "one has to allow some time to
determine if that move is sufficient."

<HEADLINE> Kenya Expects IMF to Resume Aid Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Finance Minister
Simeon Nyachae has said he was "more than confident" that the
suspended aid loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
will be restored early next year.
</P>
<P>
An IMF team will visit Kenya in December for talks on resuming
the three-year 205-million-U.S.-Dollar aid program, he was quoted
by a media report reaching here Saturday from London.
</P>
<P>
By early December this year, any remaining barriers to the
concerned talks will be removed and funding could resume as soon
as early 1999, he told the Financial Times newspaper in London
Friday after attending this week's annual meetings of the IMF and
the World Bank in Washington.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed on how to go about the outstanding issues. We
believe the remaining matters will be sorted out between now and
early December at the latest," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if fresh funds might be disbursed as early as the first
quarter of 1999, Nyachae replied: "A lot of things have already
been done behind the scenes. I am more than confident of what you
are estimating."
</P>
<P>
The IMF suspended the aid package in July 1997, only one year
into the three-year program, citing corruption and poor
governance in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said three months ago that Kenya still had to fulfill
two key conditions before it would start negotiations to restart
the program, a concessional loan package designed for some of the
world's poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
The remaining conditions were to strengthen the independence
of the country's official Anti-Corruption Authority, set up last
year, and to establish accountability in the so-called Goldenberg
fraud scandal.
</P>
<P>
Nyachae said the government was preparing new regulations to
ensure that members of the Anti-Corruption Authority were
nominated by professional bodies and civil groups, including
legal, business and banking associations, rather than by
President Daniel arap Moi or other political figures.
</P>
<P>
More steps would have to be taken to ensure that corruption
was seen to be effectively punished, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Moi suspended the authority's boss, John Harun Mwau, in July
after Mwau's accusations of fraud against four senior Treasury
officials sparked a war of words with Nyachae.
