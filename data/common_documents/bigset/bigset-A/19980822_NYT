JAMES PERINS, 86, ADVISER ON HIGHER EDUCATION POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Vt., P., N.Y.)   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. James A. Perkins, a former president of Cornell University
and an authority on higher education for philanthropic and national
advisory groups, died Aug. 20 at a rest home in Burlington, Vt. He
was 86 and had lived in Princeton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins became Cornell's president in 1963 and immediately
signaled his intention to establish Cornell as a center for
practical research. He restructured existing engineering programs
and introduced others, particularly in medicine and the sciences.
Among his ambitious construction projects were the Space Sciences
building, which housed the laboratories of Carl Sagan and other
astrophysicists, and the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art, which
was designed by I.M. Pei.
</P>
<P>
   But Perkins resigned his post after only six years in office,
having come under severe criticism for his handling of a
confrontation with a group of armed students in April 1969 that
brought national attention to the campus and indelibly marked his
tenure. The occupation of the Cornell student union by black
students set the stage for racial confrontations at campuses around
the country and is remembered as one of the most controversial of
the decade.
</P>
<P>
   The furor began with demands by the campus' relatively small
number of black students for a stronger role in developing
curriculum and, at one point, a separate college for black
students. There were fist-shaking demonstrations and finally _ the
action that caught the attention of the nation _ the armed
occupation of Willard Straight Hall.
</P>
<P>
   After the building had been occupied for more than 30 hours,
administration officials agreed to a number of concessions,
including a pledge to nullify any judicial proceeding against the
group. That led the students to leave the hall. They would later be
pictured on television and in periodicals as grim-faced and
carrying rifles and shotguns.
</P>
<P>
   Many faculty members were outraged at this image of Cornell and
at what they considered the school's outright surrender to armed
threats. They voted overwhelmingly to reject the agreement between
the student rebels and the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins' critics also called into question his efforts to
accelerate the recruitment of minority students, whose number rose
during his tenure to 250 from fewer than 10.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the vote, facing the threat of further turmoil,
the Cornell faculty reversed itself and nullified disciplinary
action against the students. Many faculty members and some trustees
accused Perkins of having sold out and began an investigation of
the episode. Less than two months later, Perkins submitted his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, in a footnote to that troublesome period, a Cornell
trustee, Thomas W. Jones _ a senior executive in the Travelers
Group _ established the James A. Perkins Prize for Interracial
Understanding and Harmony at Cornell. What made the gift
remarkable, Perkins' son David said Friday was that Jones had been
a leader of the African-American group that had taken over Willard
Straight Hall.
</P>
<P>
   James Alfred Perkins was born in Philadelphia on Oct. 11, 1911.
He graduated from Swarthmore College in 1934 and earned a master's
degree and doctorate in political science at Princeton University.
After teaching at Princeton and Swarthmore, he became a vice
president of the Carnegie Corp., for which he directed
philanthropic work for 13 years. He was also wrote influential
reports on government and military planning that led to an active
role as an adviser of government groups on education and defense.
He was a national security adviser to John F. Kennedy during his
time as a senator and during his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   After Perkins' departure from Cornell, he continued to be active
in education policy and government issues. From 1967 to 1973, he
was a member of the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education. In
1978, President Jimmy Carter appointed him chairman of the
President's Commission on Foreign Language and International
Studies. At his death, he was chairman emeritus of the
International Council for Educational Development, in Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   He was the author of a number of books and articles, including
``The University in Transition'' (Princeton University Press,
1966).
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son David, of Raleigh, N.C., Perkins is
survived by his wife, Ruth; another son, John, of Sheridan, Ore.;
three daughters, Barbara Tinker of Carlisle, Mass., Joan
Bredin-Price of Amherst, Mass., and Tracy Perkins of Northhampton,
Mass.; four stepchildren, Cecelia Matthews of Princeton, Mea
Kaemmerlen of Plainsboro, N.J., Pamela McPherson of Washington, and
Christian Aall of Boston; seven grandchildren, and one
great-grandchild.

GINGRICH CRITICIZED OVER FUND-RAISING PARTY'S HOST 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 BY SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It's billed as a fun, free summer picnic, a great
chance for the regular folks to mingle with Republican
officeholders at a magnificent island estate and feast on hot dogs
and barbecue, tofu and stir-fry. The main attraction is House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, who will be trying to establish a new
category in the Guinness Book of World Records: greatest number of
individual photographs taken with people in a single day.
</P>
<P>
   But when Gingrich joins the festivities on Saturday at the local
Republican Party bash on Vashon Island, which could draw 10,000
people, he will also be stepping squarely into a controversy. It is
one that Democrats here are hoping to seize to their advantage in
this fall's Washington state elections, including several that
could be critical in the Republicans' bid to maintain their
majority in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The host of the picnic is Thomas Stewart, a wealthy Seattle
businessman who this year pleaded guilty to violating federal
campaign laws and paid nearly $5 million in fines, the
third-largest penalty in history for violation of those laws.
Stewart, chief executive of the privately held Services Group of
America, admitted that he gave employees $100,000 in bonuses and
directed them to give the money to Republican candidates. In
addition to the fines, Stewart served two months of home detention
at his estate on Vashon Island, near Seattle, and performed 160
hours of community service at a local soup kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats here have leaped to condemn the Republicans'
acceptance of Stewart's largesse in putting on the annual picnic,
whose cost is at least $100,000. And they say it is highly
inappropriate for Gingrich, a harsh critic of Democratic
fund-raising practices, to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's completely outrageous that he would go to this event,''
said Paul Berendt, the chairman of the Washington Democratic Party.
``It shows incredibly poor judgment that he would agree to appear
at the picnic of an admitted money launderer.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were quick to argue Friday that they saw nothing
wrong with Stewart's sponsorship of the picnic or Gingrich's
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This event is free,'' said Mark Pilla, spokesman for the state
Republican Party. ``None of this is about money. The speaker likes
contact with the grass roots.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats need to concentrate on issues that are important
to the American people,'' Mike Shields, a spokesman for the
speaker's political office, said in a telephone interview from the
state fair in Iowa, which Gingrich attended Friday as part of an
18-day campaign and fund-raising tour around the country. ``I think
it's ironic that the Democratic state party is reduced to attacking
us over an event that is free and open to the public and just a fun
day out for a Saturday picnic.''
</P>
<P>
   The event is indeed free, including the wallet-sized photo that
anyone who is photographed with Gingrich may receive, though it is
to be followed by a closed-door fund-raiser for Republican
candidates, also to be attended by Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Attendees will also be invited to throw ``a dollar or two'' into
a pot, allowing them to cast a ballot in a mock vote for U.S.
senator. And they can pay $20 for an 8-by-10-inch photograph with
the speaker or $70 for a photo plaque, though Pilla said all that
money would go to the photographer, not to the party.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich has used the term ``megastate'' to describe
Washington's importance to the Republicans in this fall's
elections. In the historic Republican takeover in 1994, the party
won seven of Washington's nine House seats, including that of the
incumbent Democratic speaker, Thomas Foley. Two years later, it
retained control of five of those seats by narrow margins, and many
races are expected to be intensely competitive this fall.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Stewart, one of the biggest contributors to Republicans in the
state, has hosted the picnic at his 163-acre ranch for years. Last
year the guest of honor was Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader,
and in 1996 it was Jack Kemp, the Republican vice-presidential
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The illegal contributions were part of a scheme to circumvent
the $1,000 limit on individual contributions to a campaign. Stewart
admitted to them as part of a plea bargain with federal
prosecutors. In court this March, he expressed regret and declared,
``It won't happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   A telephone call to Stewart's office Friday was returned by
Lincoln Ferris, his company's vice president for community
relations, who provided logistical details about the picnic but
declined to comment on the Democrats' criticism of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really the party's picnic,'' Ferris said, adding that
Stewart was ``just providing a venue and the food.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's aide, Shields, said the speaker was unlikely to break
the record listed in the Guinness book for most hands shaken by a
public figure at a public event: 8,513, by President Theodore
Roosevelt at the White House on New Year's Day 1907. But, he said,
Guinness representatives planned to be on hand for Saturday's
picture taking, which might form the basis of a new entry in the
next edition.
</P>
<P>
   At about six seconds per picture, the speaker could have his
photograph taken with 600 people per hour. He is so eager to
establish a bona fide record that he plans to be on hand for at
least five hours, and, said Shields, ``that's longer than he
usually spends in one place at one time.''

FUNDING VETO STUNS GROUP PUSHING VALLEY SECESSION FROM L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERRI HARDY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Gov. Pete Wilson vetoed a $340,000 appropriation
that would have paid one-third of the cost of a study of San
Fernando Valley cityhood, saying state general fund money should
not be used for a ``regional concern.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's action Friday deals a setback to efforts to come
up with public money to pay the $1 million expected cost of the
study by the county's Local Agency Formation Commission, which
would be triggered if the Valley VOTE petition drive succeeds in
getting 135,000 signatures. State funding depended on city and
county government paying an equal amount.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson staff members said the governor did not want to set a
precedent that would require the state to pay for other cityhood
efforts in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have signed bills designed to assist the Valley in
determining whether it's in its citizens' best interest to set up
their own government,'' Wilson said through spokesman Sean Walsh.
``I continue to support self-determination for the Valley, but
regrettably, there was technical language and a little political
gamesmanship being played that compelled me to veto this bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said it is up to the Valley delegation of lawmakers to
create legislation that will ensure the area's wishes are met.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Valley Voters Organized Toward Empowerment said they
were surprised by the governor's position and vowed to push for the
city and county to foot the entire bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed -- the state Senate and Assembly believed
this was something the state should participate in,'' said Jeff
Brain, president of Valley VOTE.
</P>
<P>
   Added Valley VOTE Chairman Richard Close, ``I hope the
governor's veto had more to do with money and was not an expression
of his views on the San Fernando Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   A secession study, the first step in breaking away from Los
Angeles, would examine whether the city would be financially
damaged by the split and whether the Valley would be economically
viable.
</P>
<P>
   LAFCO has been adamant that the group petitioning the study
should pay. Valley VOTE has been equally firm that LAFCO, a county
agency, must foot the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Two state lawmakers earlier this month tried to bridge the
impasse by pushing legislation that would split the cost three
ways: among the state, county and city.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson vetoed the $340,000 expenditure because he did not want
to set a precedent in which the state pays for boundary studies
done by local commissions, said H.D. Palmer, assistant director of
the state's Department of Finance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legislation would have activated a mechanism that would
open that door,'' Palmer said. ``That caused us great concern.''
</P>
<P>
   The Valley is the only instance in which a community has tried
to break away from a city in the past 90 years in California. Other
cityhood efforts involved annexations or formation of cities in
unincorporated areas.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer said the governor's decision was about procedure and
``was not an opinion on secession.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Cathie Wright, R-Simi Valley, who wrote the funding
bill, said she thought the veto would hinder Valley VOTE's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have a million dollars,'' Wright said. ``This will
prolong their efforts at a time when the public wants resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson signed a $75.4 billion budget Friday that included $31.4
billion for California's schools and a $1.4 billion tax-cut
package.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Assemblyman Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, one of the
lawmakers who fought for the funding compromise, said they
disagreed with Wilson's rationale.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot is at stake,'' said Paul Hefner, press director for
Hertzberg. ``This proposal would affect so many folks, it deserves
a full study.''
</P>
<P>
   County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said he would support sharing
the cost but doesn't know whether those feelings are shared by his
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I don't know if there would be enough votes, and I
don't think the City Council would support it,'' Yaroslavsky said.
</P>
<P>
   City Councilman Hal Bernson said he will support efforts for Los
Angeles to come up with a portion of the costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor has turned his back on the Valley and is working
with those trying to make it impossible to get a study,'' Bernson
said. ``It's a good thing for him he's not running for re-election
because he would not get too many votes in the Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Mayor Richard Riordan said the mayor would oppose the
use of any city funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have the city pay to study breaking it up? I don't think so,''
said spokeswoman Noelia Rodriguez. ``I don't see the mayor leading
the charge for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Close said added pressure might be put on the city to come up
with the money as part of a settlement of a lawsuit filed by the
American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California. The suit
claims city officials interfered with Valley VOTE's petition drive
by ejecting its members from the recent air show in suburban Van
Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   Valley VOTE is scrambling to collect enough signatures by
Thursday to trigger the citywide study. Brain said the group has
gathered almost 120,000 of the 135,000 names needed but probably
needs 50,000 extra signatures to ensure success.
</P>
<P>
   Hertzberg also has worked to pass legislation that would allow
Valley VOTE 90 additional days to collect signatures. But that
bill, which has passed through the Senate, is stalled there as part
of the end-of-session political gamesmanship, Hefner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislative logjam has nothing to do with this bill; it's
about the differences among the members of the Assembly and the
Senate,'' he said. ``It's our hope that there's a resolution to
this by the end of the session.''
</P>
<P>
   Hefner said a legal opinion issued by the legislative counsel
determined that the group already had 180 days under law to collect
signatures -- even though LAFCO has deemed that the group has only
90. Hertzberg's bill, then, would simply clarify the matter by
restating the existing law, Hefner said.
</P>
<P>
   Close said Valley VOTE will operate as if its deadline is
Thursday, but that the group obviously would welcome legislation
that gives it more time.

NEW YORK TIGHTENS SECURITY AT PUBLIC BUILDINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The heightened security measures at public buildings
went almost unnoticed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Around town, the security alert ordered by Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir manifested itself in
small, all but imperceptible, ways.
</P>
<P>
   At midday five Metropolitan Transportation Authority officers
were standing outside Grand Central Terminal, for example, when
normally there would be one. A New York City police officer who
usually patrols several blocks near the Port Authority Bus Terminal
was sticking close to the bus station, and two police officers had
been sent to the U.N. building to stand guard on the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   The officers said they were on the lookout for suspicious
packages or cars left on the street with their engines running. But
they themselves were not arousing any curiosity. ``Nobody's asked
any questions _ except directions,'' said one officer, who spoke on
the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, officials of the Federal Aviation Administration
and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said they were
also taking precautions because of the possible threat of
terrorism. But passengers at Kennedy International Airport and
Newark International Airport said they were puzzled by the absence
of a more visible show of security.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected all these strict rules when I got here today,''
said Kate Doble, who was boarding a flight at Kennedy to return
home to Sydney, Australia, after working as a summer-camp counselor
in North Carolina. ``I expected to be checked or have someone go
through my bags, but they just passed me by.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurent Mercier, a French government worker who was traveling to
Los Angeles, said he was surprised that no one stopped him from
leaving unattended luggage on a seat near the United Airlines
ticket counter in Newark, N.J. ``I left my bag on the seat and went
to smoke a cigarette, and nobody said anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mercier said that because of the military strike, he had arrived
at the airport two hours and 15 minutes before his scheduled 6:30
p.m. departure. ``If there had not been a strike, I would have gone
to the Port Authority and caught a bus at about 4:15 to get here at
5:15,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, passengers arriving at Kennedy after an
Aeroflot flight from St. Petersburg, Russia, said they noticed
something a little out of the ordinary when they picked up their
luggage at the Delta Air Lines baggage-claim area: a beagle was
sniffing the bags. ``I've never seen that before,'' said Harry
Wilson, a political science professor from Roanoke, Va. ``But
coming through customs was easy. Customs was the same as always.''
</P>
<P>
   At the U.N. building, three security officers stood behind the
entry gate asking visitors with large packages to check them, a
normal routine. One of them, Hugh Mullaney, said that he had not
detected any heightened anxiety about the prospect of terrorism,
perhaps because memories of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade
Center are no longer fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will have to start happening closer to home before people
get nervous,'' Mullaney said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some tourists visiting the United Nations brushed off the talk
of danger. ``We're more scared in France than we are here,'' said
Valerie Nollet, a French real estate broker.
</P>
<P>
   The terrorism alert was having little effect on travel plans,
travel agents across the city said. Most people who go abroad in
late August have nonrefundable tickets and are traveling for
pleasure, rather than business, and this is not the recommended
season for travel to either Africa or the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Wilson, the owner of an agency that bears her name, said
that since the bombing of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania,
about two dozen clients had inquired whether it was safe to travel,
but only one had canceled plans to go on a safari in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``People wanted to know if maybe there wasn't a stronger warning
that they hadn't heard over the news,'' she said. ``These were
calls to get reassuring comments.''
</P>
<P>
   But other travel agents said their phones were not even ringing.
``I thought we would be receiving a lot more calls,'' said
Alexandre Chemla, the president of Altours International, another
travel agency.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Peter Kane, the president of Pisa Bros. Travel Service,
said that travelers today were more sophisticated than they used to
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one time, if something like this happened, our telephones
would have been jammed,'' he said. ``Everybody would have canceled,
even if they were just going to visit their uncle in Pennsylvania.
Now we don't panic. We just wait and see.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if new embassies are blown up,'' he added, ``it's going to
be a whole new ball game.''

   Buhrke tugs on the bill of his cap and bounces up and down,
kicking his feet to about shoulder width apart. He smacks his hand
into his glove. He takes a few steps backward, looks into the
gleaming sun and stands just inches off the line _ the crosswalk
line.
</P>
<P>
   We are standing among the baseball legends chasing history.
Sosa, Buhrke.
</P>
<P>
   We are at the corner of Waveland and Kenmore, behind the
left-field wall of Wrigley Field, where the rumble of the El
clatters windows, the smell of bratwurst and stale Old Style is in
the air and legends roam.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa hits home runs into the streets here. Buhrke and a unique
group of veteran Waveland Avenue ``ball-hawks'' chase them down.
</P>
<P>
   It is here where a group of about 10 regular ball-hawks, all of
them hardened veterans, all of them friendly, spend game days in
lawn chairs under a shade tree at Waveland and Kenmore. Near a
street light where a Dominican Republic flag hangs in reverence to
Sosa, they swig beer, trade stories and talk Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   There is no radio play-by-play action in the background, yet
with one casual glance at the Wrigley scoreboard they all seem to
know which player is up, which is on deck, lefty or righty, and
when to hop into position.
</P>
<P>
   They have become friends from their time spent chasing home runs
together on Waveland. They chip in for beer, go on road trips
together, travel to spring training and even get together every
year for what they call ``winter meetings,'' the details of which
sound an awful lot like a bachelor party.
</P>
<P>
   They respect each other's ``position.'' Buhrke stands smack in
the middle of the crosswalk on Kenmore. This is the position of
choice, and remarkable experience has earned Buhrke this place.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Vangeloff is off on Waveland, a bit back from the curb
behind the bleachers. Thick-chested Andy Mielke plays left-center.
Johnny Rosenstein inches closer to the foul pole. Dave Davison is
here, Jerry Pritikin is there.
</P>
<P>
   They have great skills and instincts, but few will admit to
being in the same class as Buhrke, 52, who has been chasing home
runs on Waveland Avenue for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   He has been to at least half of all Cubs home games since he was
12. He has flagged down balls from Mickey Mantle (in an All-Star
Game), Ernie Banks and Willie Mays. Once, then-Cub Joe Pepitone
came running out of the stadium in full uniform after Ron Santo hit
a significant home run. Pepitone ran straight toward Buhrke and
asked for the ball.
</P>
<P>
   From the dugout, Pepitone saw where the ball traveled over the
wall and figured Buhrke probably caught it. He had.
</P>
<P>
   Buhrke has covered every inch of the streets surrounding the
Wrigley outfield wall, from the flower beds lining the apartments
on Kenmore to the tables lining Murphy's Bar behind right field.
</P>
<P>
   Buhrke has caught 2,936 home runs, the majority from batting
practice. His most prized catches have been Santo's 300th homer
(the one Pepitone retrieved in exchange for other signed balls and
bats), Ryne Sandberg's 100th home run and four grand slams,
including one by Banks.
</P>
<P>
   He is the father of all ball-hawks. And this is his time to
shine.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, along with the Cardinals' Mark McGwire, is chasing Roger
Maris' record of 61.
</P>
<P>
   This week has been particularly important for Buhrke and the
ball-hawks, because McGwire was in town earlier and San Francisco's
Barry Bonds, who is one home run short of his 400th, was in town
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The adrenalin rush is unbelievable when you get one,'' Buhrke
said. ``This is the closest I'll ever get to the big leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   The others in the group have real-world rsums that range from
computer analysts to train conductors to ``career Bleacher Bum,''
as one put it.
</P>
<P>
   Buhrke, who heads a security staff at a Chicago department
store, rarely has seen a Cubs game from inside the stadium. He is
lanky and trim and looks much younger than his age, wearing a gray
Cubs T-shirt, a crisp hat and dark hair neatly cropped above his
ears.
</P>
<P>
   He clearly hasn't lost a step, although these are among the most
challenging days the ball-hawks have seen. The streets have been
bustling with fly-by-nighters showing up, hoping to catch history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 300 people out here when McGwire was in town,'' Mielke
said. ``That was ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the ball-hawks are convinced that among the increasing
numbers roaming Waveland are hired guns brought in by professional
collectors and memorabilia dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want those 50th and 57th (NL record for home runs) home
runs from Sosa, so they can get big money,'' Buhrke said.
</P>
<P>
   But they'll need a lot of luck beating these Waveland ball-hawks
to the ball.
</P>
<P>
   They are the best of the best. During the Home Run Derby when
the Cubs hosted the 1990 All-Star Game, the ball-hawks accounted
for 24 of the 28 home runs hit out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our proudest moment,'' Mielke said.
</P>
<P>
   This week when McGwire hit No. 48 out of the park, it was
Vangeloff who caught the ball amid a swarm of fans, falling as he
squeezed it and then being mobbed by some who tried to pry the ball
loose. Vangeloff's ball-hawk friends came to his rescue, pulling
people off the pile and making sure Vangeloff kept the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's not you that gets it, we all hope that it's one of
us,'' Rosenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, as Sosa was looking for his 49th and 50th shots of the
year and Bonds for the 400th of his career, the ball-hawks were in
top form. During batting practice, Sosa hit just one ball out. But
the ball-hawks got it.
</P>
<P>
   On another shot out of the yard during batting practice,
Rosenstein made what Buhrke described as one of the best catches he
had seen in 40 years on Waveland. As the ball sailed over the wall,
Rosenstein sprinted under it, but a taxi was turning from Kenmore
onto Waveland directly in line with the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenstein jumped onto the moving taxi, knocked the ball off the
hood and covered it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what you're out here for,'' Buhrke said. ``Most people
who try to catch one drop it, because they can't handle the
pressure. You have to know what you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   When game time arrived, the mood shifted to serious every time
Sosa stepped up. Everyone got into position. When Sosa popped out
the first time up, the next sound was beer bottles popping open.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Sosa doubled. Nice, but no home run. Finally in the
bottom of the fifth, Sosa sent one deep to left-center field. The
crowd roared.
</P>
<P>
   It might be. It could be.
</P>
<P>
   Ball-hawks from every direction broke into frenzied sprints
toward Mielke's position, but the ball fell into that most
frustrating of places _ over the fence but not far enough to hit
the street. The ball-hawks came up empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there. I had it,'' Mielke said. ``Just a little more,
and it was mine. Some fat guy in the bleachers got it. That's
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the game was just a tease. Bonds never
threatened to get his 400th. Sosa never got No. 50. The ball-hawks
went home with just a couple of batting-practice balls.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, today's another day. The Astros will be in town today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like the Astros,'' Mielke said. ``They've got lots of
righthanded power.''

FUEL TRUCK ACCIDENT SHUTS DOWN LONG ISLAND EXPRESSWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 JOHN T. McQUISTON   
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERICHO, N.Y. _ A tanker truck carrying nearly 11,000 gallons of
gasoline created a weekend motorist's nightmare Friday afternoon
when it overturned on the Long Island Expressway, halting all
traffic in the heart of Nassau County for more than eight hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in a car, don't come to Long Island. Every road near
the expressway is completely at a standstill. It's a horror show,''
said Officer William Bendel of the Nassau County Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Among the motorists who found themselves trapped in the middle
of the stalled traffic was Mark Sedlak, who almost made it to his
destination, Exit 43, when he was forced to jam on his brakes. ``I
have just a few more exits to go,'' he said, ``but I've heard it's
completely stopped out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The nightmare began at 1:05 p.m. when the massive truck, heading
east, swerved as it attempted to avoid a car changing lanes. The
truck shuddered, jackknifed and flipped on its side in the middle
of the eastbound lanes near Exit 41, spilling nearly 150 gallons
and causing traffic on both sides of the six-lane expressway to
begin backing up, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency vehicles and firetrucks from the Jericho Fire
Department, whose station house is located just off the expressway,
quickly arrived at the scene, halted traffic in both directions and
began pumping a white chemical foam onto the roadway, smothering
the spilled gasoline whose volatile fumes filled air. In 80-degree
temperatures, the heat from the pavement increased the possibility
of an explosion, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   As a precautionary measure, the county police department ordered
the evacuation of homes in Jericho and Hicksville within a
half-mile radius of the accident. For those having nowhere else to
go, the police said they had set up temporary shelters at the State
University of New York campus at Old Westbury, which is just north
the expressway, and at the shopping mall in Hicksville south of the
accident scene, according to Officer Adele Burke.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the truck, who was not immediately identified, was
slightly injured and was taken to the Nassau County Medical Center,
according to the police.
</P>
<P>
   The expressway was closed in both directions between Exits 40
and 43, creating, in effect, a five-mile-long vacant parking lot on
a stretch of the expressway that is normally jammed with afternoon
traffic heading east from New York City. Friday, however, there was
the added ingredient of thousands of additional motorists heading
for the beaches in the Hamptons and other summer resorts on eastern
Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   As the afternoon wore on traffic backed up to the Queens border
and jammed the Northern State Parkway, which runs parallel to and
crosses over the Long Island Expressway just a few miles east of
the overturned tanker truck.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 4 p.m., a second tanker, operated by the same
company, Island Transportation Corp. of West Babylon, which
distributes gasoline to service stations throughout Long Island,
pulled up alongside the toppled tanker and began the tedious and
time consuming task of off-loading fuel from the disabled truck.
</P>
<P>
   Police said that the process could take at least three hours and
said that the roadway might remain closed until 10 p.m., with the
westbound lanes expected to be the first to reopen.

A RITUAL FOR SUMMER THEATER IN THE PARK 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDISON, N.J. _ It is early on a sunny afternoon in the heart of
Roosevelt Park and, as usual, there are two growing lines of mostly
empty lawn chairs. A few people are actually sitting in the chairs
_ reading, sleeping, playing cards _ as if the children running
around nearby have created an imaginary bus to nowhere and
persuaded everyone else to play along.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, these are the ticket lines for Plays in the Park,
Middlesex County's open-air, bring-your-own-chair summer theater
series, now in its 36th season. Although the ticket booth does not
open until 5:30 p.m. and show time is not until 8:30, theater fans
often begin gathering shortly after noon, many with multiple chairs
to hold spaces for themselves and others.
</P>
<P>
   The performances, mostly of big-name musicals, are
sophisticated, semiprofessional productions not unlike those in
hundreds of other summer theater programs, including the New York
Shakespeare Festival's summer series, Shakespeare in the Park. What
sets Plays in the Park apart is the unspoken philosophy shared by
many of its fans: if you have to bring your own chair, you might as
well get the best seat in the house.
</P>
<P>
   The long wait in the lawn chairs has become a bizarre ritual, as
much a part of the Plays in the Park experience as seeing the
shows, and strict rules are posted on signs along the paths from
the parking area to the small brown hut that serves as a ticket
booth. The first rule is that while in line, people must remain
with their chairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are not with your chairs, the chairs get thrown out,''
warned Bob Kay, 58, who was first in line for the opening
performance of ``My Fair Lady'' earlier this month. Kay, who has
been attending the shows for more than 15 years, said enforcement
can be strict, particularly later in the afternoon, and added that
his chairs had been tossed from the line by the police on a
previous occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they do go through the chairs, it's around 4 o'clock or a
little after, so I try to beat the system,'' said Kay, who put his
chairs in line about 1 p.m. and returned at 3:30, thereby evading
the surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   But even the pros slip up sometimes. With two hours to go before
the gates opened, Kay had forgotten his newspaper and was searching
desperately for reading material.
</P>
<P>
   Once the gates open at 5:30, audience members can pay for
admission ($3 for adults, free for children) and place their chairs
in the seating area of the Stephen J. Capestro Theater. They are
then free to leave and return for the show.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Detective William Van Doren of the Middlesex County police, who
has patrolled Plays in the Park shows for more than 20 years, said
unattended chairs pose a hazard. When the line pushes forward, they
get knocked over, he said. People trip over them, or get their feet
caught in the slats. ``As soon as everybody sees I'm here, they
start running to their chairs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans of the lines at Plays in the Park say that despite the
informality, etiquette generally prevails, and only the police have
been known to remove unattended chairs. Those who leave their
chairs as place holders tend to stay inside the park.
</P>
<P>
   Farther back in line were Dave and Gloria Kuchinsky, who had
driven 40 minutes from their home in Jamesburg to meet their
daughter-in-law Joy and grandchildren Michelle, 9, and Reuben, 5.
The Kuchinskys planned to buy their tickets, set up their chairs
and break for supper before returning at show time.
</P>
<P>
   Joy Kuchinsky, who lives nearby in Highland Park, had called for
a pizza to be ready at exactly 6:15. She would pick it up and take
the children home to meet her husband and eat. Her in-laws opted
for the picnic tables in the park instead. ``We have cheese
sandwiches,'' Gloria Kuchinsky said. ``And coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   Some parents drop off a child to wait in line. For example, Tom
LeCompte, 13, of Metuchen had instructions to buy tickets for his
mother, aunt and two sisters. He was in a lawn chair reading a
thick biography of Richard Nixon, required summer reading for this
fall's English class. ``I'm the oldest child,'' he said, explaining
why the place holding fell to him. ``My mom has other things to do,
like cook dinner and stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   As Tom read, the two lines behind him, one for each of the
ticket booth windows, continued to grow. Shortly before 5:30, the
producing director of Plays in the Park, Gary Cohen, announced that
ticket sales were about to begin. With a great chorus of aluminum
scraping on asphalt, the chairs were folded up and the lines
pressed ahead. ``We're a community theater, but we are a very
high-level community theater,'' Cohen said on another day this
month as he prepared for a rehearsal of ``Jerry's Girls,'' a
variety show featuring the songs of Jerry Herman that opens Tuesday
and is the last show of the season. Each April, several hundred
people audition for the four summer shows, Cohen said. ``There are
people who came to the shows as babies, who are in the shows as
teen-agers and wind up going on to careers.'' Some cast members
have gone on to Broadway, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The magician David Copperfield is part of the lore. A native of
Metuchen, he performed in ``Plain and Fancy'' in 1973 in his
pre-magic days.

DRAFTING OF WILLIAMS NOW LOOKS PRUDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suddenly, the Giants no longer have to defend their decision to
use their first-round draft choice to select defensive back Shaun
Williams. Instead, they are thankful anew that Williams was around
when it was their turn to pick last April.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Williams, a college safety whose value was always
higher because of his potential skills as a cornerback, appeared to
be adding depth to what was already a team strength.
</P>
<P>
   But with cornerback Jason Sehorn now out for the season with two
torn knee ligaments, Williams will begin an accelerated course in
the one-on-one coverage expertise necessary to exist in the
unsheltered, perilous world of cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad Hamilton, a 23-year-old third-year player with one
National Football League start, will take Sehorn's place, and the
Giants will give Hamilton every opportunity to hold the job. But at
5 feet 10 inches and 190 pounds, he will be giving away height and
weight to many opposing receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who is 6 feet 2 inches and 215 pounds, may have more
upside. In case Hamilton falters, the Giants plan to give Williams
a cram course in cornerback beginning with Saturday's practice at
Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   As one Giants official said Friday, ``Shaun may have to play
before he's ready.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Giants' 27-23 loss to the Jets in a preseason game on
Thursday night, Williams continued to play as a safety and an extra
defensive back in nickel packages. He was beaten for the
game-winning third-quarter touchdown catch by the Jets' Dedric
Ward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cornerback is not a foreign position to him,'' Giants coach
Jim Fassel said of Williams. ``We've worked him there in camp. The
downside is we have given him a lot to absorb in a short period of
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel said Hamilton played well in Sehorn's place on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have the size of Jason,'' said Fassel, referring to
Sehorn, who is 6 feet 2 inches and 210 pounds. ``But he's very
quick and tenacious. You're very exposed out there at corner. If
teams are going to go after him, we can help shore him up, but he's
going to have to do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   The current backup cornerback is 10th-year veteran Robert
Massey. The Giants signed Massey, 31, last year after he was
released by Jacksonville. Also in the picture is Jeremy Lincoln,
another free agent the Giants signed this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants searched the league for weeks for a backup cornerback
and eventually decided that Lincoln, 27, was their best option. It
is unlikely they will turn to the free agent market to find another
cornerback. Lincoln, a former starter with the Chicago Bears, has
had an uneven preseason and has not seriously threatened Hamilton
for the prime backup spot.
</P>
<P>
   Way Not Badly Injured
</P>
<P>
   Jim Fassel said fullback Charles Way, who sprained his left
ankle early in Thursday's game and did not return to play, was not
seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   The coach complimented running back Gary Brown, who had 51 yards
rushing on 13 carries Thursday. It is the best rushing total of any
Giants back this preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Of Tiki Barber, whom Fassel had been critical of last week, the
coach said: ``Tiki is back. I saw the burst and spark that has
always made him effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Barber had 37 yards on eight carries and four receptions for 24
yards.

TOO MUCH TIME OFF   
 TIMMS HOPES TO TURN CORNER IN PLAYOFFS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fix that Michele Timms has found herself in this season
didn't just happen. It was a well-intentioned, thought-out plan
gone awry that's had the Mercury point guard playing catch-up to
her expectations and admittedly falling short.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it a Monday or a Wednesday?'' said the Australian, whose
feelings about her future change daily. ``I'm just really
frustrated with myself. One day, it's like this is the end, and the
next day, I wake up and think we'll have four weeks (of preseason)
together next season and it won't be like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way I'm going to throw it in before 2000 because
that's my goal, to play in the Olympics in my own back yard and
hopefully win a medal. I definitely don't want to finish my career
on this note.''
</P>
<P>
   What went wrong was that Timms had no idea how to properly go on
holiday from a job on which she worked virtually non-stop for two
years.
</P>
<P>
   In succession, she played for BTV Wuppertal of the German League
(1995-96 EuroLeague champion), the Sydney Flames of the Australian
Women's National Basketball League (spring 1996 Player of the
Year), the Australian Olympic team (summer 1996 bronze medalist),
Wuppertal again (1996-97 EuroLeague runner-up) and the Mercury
(summer 1997 playoff semifinals) in the inaugural season of the
WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   As evidenced by a league-low 41 points against New York in the
playoffs, the Mercury's tank was as empty as its floor leader's.
</P>
<P>
   So for the first time in a professional career that began in
1984, Timms put basketball completely aside except for a WNBA
postseason European tour and the television analysis she did of
Arizona State and Arizona women's college games. A reprieve of more
than seven months set Timms' head straight but did nothing for her
body.
</P>
<P>
   ``She needed that mental break, but she's the first to say that
having that long (break), she lost the edge of her game shape,''
said Timms' agent, Hugh Sandie. ``And that's the basis of Michele's
game. This has been a valuable lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   The theory that Timms could join the Goldmark Opals (Australian
National Team) in April and play herself into WNBA shape by the
completion of the World Championships only partially stood up. In
nine World games, she averaged only 25.1 minutes _ the rest going
to now Mercury teammate Kristi Harrower and Annie La Fleur _ and
returned two days before the Mercury season began with a new
offense to digest. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Learning new offense &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Where I handled myself really well at the World Championships
_ and we did good enough and got the bronze medal (8-1 record) _
it's a little bit different here,'' Timms said. ``It was really
hard at first when I came back, point guard, not knowing the
offense, having to lead when you don't know what you're leading.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrie Graf, assistant coach with the Opals and the Mercury,
agreed that Timms was crying out for time off but thinks that two
months would have been sufficient, particularly for an athlete
facing the twilight of her career, when fitness retention becomes
critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was so, I guess, burned out and flat from Atlanta (the
Olympics) and the first season here and the hype and playing
back-to-back seasons in Australia and Germany that basically, her
body and mind shut down,'' Graf said. ``Then to start it again at
32 (Timms turned 33 in June), her body just wasn't ready. It sort
of went into shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``She lost a bit of speed, and with that goes a bit of
confidence, and then it becomes a battle. Battling it day in and
day out takes away from the passion.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Lack of chemistry &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even with Timms and five others less than a week removed from
the World Championships, the Mercury started 3-0 and was 11-3
before the lack of chemistry from missing a month of training camp
began to show. A 1-6 stretch that included five consecutive losses
ensued, and the playoff berth that seemed so secure in mid-July
became as wobbly as the year before, despite a much more talented
roster.
</P>
<P>
   Timms' scoring average dropped almost in half, from 12.1 to 6.9,
as did her steals, from 71 to 38. All her shooting percentages took
a hit. With the addition of Harrower, Timms' playing time purposely
dropped from 35.8 minutes, third in the league, to 31.1, but the
only benefit was in her turnover-to-assist ratio, which soared from
1.71 to 2.29.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might not have done anything spectacular, but I feel like
I'm leading this team out on the court, which is exactly what we
needed the last six games we played in a must-win situation,''
Timms said. ``I felt like I led the team and kept my poise when I
had to and used my experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Like last year, the Mercury clinched a playoff spot in the final
game of the regular season, when Timms was a season-best 5 of 6
from the free-throw line and contributed 13 points. Her match-up
with Suzie McConnell Serio will be critical to the outcome of a
best-of-three semifinal that will begin at 5 p.m. today at America
West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must admit I'm excited about the series,'' Timms said.
``I've been waiting all season to turn the corner, and I'm just
hoping there is still four or five games left for us. I wouldn't be
happy with anything other than being in the Grand Finals
(championship) series, because at the start of the season, I had
such high expectations.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
New vacation plans &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Her new and improved vacation plans already are made. Timms will
play for the Opals in Australian tours against China and the United
States next month. Then she'll return to the WNBL for its new
October-March schedule. She already has talked with a specialist at
the Victoria Institute of Sport about how to improve her speed to
reignite the Mercury transition game in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's never been a person not to reassess and reevaluate,''
her agent said. ``She's willing to learn and extend her body life.
We haven't seen the best of Michele Timms yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there's something better yet to see this season, or at
least that's how Timms is interpreting her Thursday night dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shot the rock really well,'' she recalled. &QL;

STREAKY IN AND OUT OF THE RING, GATTI PREPARES FOR A TOUGH TEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arturo Gatti has a new look _ blond highlights streaked through
his brown hair _ and he claims to have a new style that he will
unveil against Ivan Robinson in a 10-round lightweight bout
Saturday at Bally's Park Place in Atlantic City as part of HBO's
``Boxing After Dark'' series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the barber to get a haircut and the girl said, `Why
don't you put some color in it?''' Gatti said.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the colors most closely associated with Gatti the
last few years are crimson, black and blue. He is prone to
swelling, particularly around the eyes, and he gets cut.
</P>
<P>
   Gatti lost his last fight eight months ago against Angel
Manfredy when the bout was stopped in the eighth round on cuts.
Gatti has been working on new ring techniques that he hopes will
keep his face intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working on not getting hit with so many right
hands,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The undercard should be just as exciting as the main event.
Fernando Vargas (13-0), a superb young junior middleweight who was
a member of the 1996 U.S. Olympic boxing team, meets Darren
Maciunski (16-5) in a 10-round bout, and Jose Luis Lopez, a top
welterweight title contender, will fight Ed Goins in a 10-rounder.
</P>
<P>
   The HBO broadcast is scheduled for 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Gatti (29-2) is an exciting fighter. He can be on the verge of
being knocked out, then summon some reserve and come back to score
a knockout. He did that against Gabriel Ruelas on Oct. 4, 1997. In
that fight, Gatti looked out on his feet in the fourth round, when
Ruelas shook him with a powerful left uppercut. But Gatti rallied
and won when the fight was stopped in round 5.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that is why his corner and the ring doctors allowed him
to continue fighting after he sustained a deep cut that measured
about two inches in the first round of his 12-round fight against
Manfredy. The cut got worse as the fight went on. It also changed
Gatti's strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My plan was to keep the pressure on him,'' Gatti said. ``He
talked like a warrior before the fight, but during the fight he was
looking for an exit. If that cut wasn't there, his confidence
wouldn't have been there. I knew the cut was bad, because when I
got hit on it, it hurt. But I was just determined to win the fight,
so I kept fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manfredy was one lucky opponent, because he never got hit
flush on the face. I think the referee would have let me go on if
the fight was 10 rounds. But he didn't want me in there for another
four rounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Gatti hopes to avoid that problem with Robinson (25-2), a tough
lightweight from Philadelphia. He will need all the skills he can
muster for Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a boxer and boxers are hard to fight,'' Gatti said. ``But
Ivan's not the fighter he thinks he is.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gatti and Robinson became acquainted when they trained together
with Pernell Whitaker in Virginia Beach, Va. They never sparred
against each other, but ``we ran many miles together,'' Robinson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Robinson will be trying to stop Gatti in his tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Gatti, a former International Boxing Federation junior
lightweight champion, needs a victory against Robinson to put
himself back in contention for a lightweight title.
</P>
<P>
   He is also trying to get his personal life back together. A few
months ago he was arrested in Miami and charged with assault after
beating up a man, whom Gatti claims came after him with a knife.
Gatti said that he paid a fine and paid the man's medical bills and
that the matter is behind him.
</P>
<P>
   If Gatti can get past Robinson, things are already in place for
him to meet Cesar Bazan for the World Boxing Council lightweight
title.

 FILLIES TAKE AIM AT JERSEY GIRL 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jersey Girl, who has won nine of her 11 starts and seven
straight this year, will be watching from the sidelines at Saratoga
Race Course Saturday while other fillies race to overtake her on
the road to the 3-year-old championship. And two daughters of
Unbridled will be playing the lead roles: Banshee Breeze, winner of
last month's Coaching Club American Oaks, and Manistique, racing's
newest ``monster,'' who has won her three starts by a total margin
of 31 lengths.
</P>
<P>
   The scene will be the 118th running of the Alabama Stakes, the
fillies' counterpart to the Travers one week later. Six fillies are
entered in the race, which will take them a mile and a quarter
carrying 121 pounds. Jersey Girl has been sidelined with a
fractured right knee and may not race again this year. And any
filly who can win the Alabama and the Gazelle next month at Belmont
Park will be making a strong move toward catching Jersey Girl for
the title.
</P>
<P>
   Manistique is not exactly a mystery horse, although she did not
race anywhere at two because she had foot problems and also grew to
16 or 17 hands, a spectacular height for a filly. When she finally
did go to the races in May, she won at Hollywood Park by 11
lengths. One month later, again at Hollywood, she won by 10. And
one month after that, stepping up to the Hollywood Oaks at a mile
and an eighth, she won by 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big question for us,'' said her trainer, John Shirreffs,
``is have we seen her best races? She's very big and very long, she
has a great head and a sharp eye. I certainly would like to have
her in a position to go for the division championship, but I think
that will be determined in the next two races.''

DOMBROWKSI, OTHERS ON DODGERS INTERVIEW LIST FOR GM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Florida general manager Dave Dombrowski spoke informally
Friday with Dodgers interim general manager Tom Lasorda and is
expected to fly to Los Angeles next week to interview for the
Dodgers' general manager position with club president Bob Graziano.
</P>
<P>
   While it appears the Dodgers might be trying to accelerate the
hiring process by having Dombrowski meet first with Graziano, the
Marlins said Friday they hope Dombrowski returns next season.
</P>
<P>
   Dombrowski is in the final season of a multi-year contract that
is paying about $700,000 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation that if the Marlins are sold by Wayne
Huizenga to club president Don Smiley, Florida would ask Dombrowski
to take a pay cut. A Dodgers' offer would drive up the bidding and
Smiley knows there is no way he could compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never have discussed that,'' Smiley said. ``It's never,
ever come up.''
</P>
<P>
   Dombrowski, who sat with Lasorda for several innings during
Friday's 5-1 Dodgers victory, refused to comment on his status with
either club. Lasorda is expected to meet this weekend with Atlanta
Braves assistant general manager Dean Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also have received permission to talk to Cincinnati
Reds general manager Jim Bowden, but no appointment has been set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on this process on both sides,'' said Lasorda, who
was wooed by several clubs during his 20 years as manager. ``I
think we are going to be talking about this for a lot more days. I
think this is going to take awhile.''
</P>
<P>
   Park clutch: Dodgers right-hander Chan Ho Park thought Glenn
Hoffman was taking him out of the game when the manager came to the
mound with runners at first and third and two outs in the eighth.
Second baseman Eric Young committed an error on Cliff Floyd's
grounder and closer Jeff Shaw was ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me to pick up E.Y. (Young) for the team,'' Park said
later. ``That's what I'm expected to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Park limited the Marlins to four hits and one run in eight
innings. He walked two and struck out seven. Three of those
strikeouts came in the third inning after Matt Luke misplayed Gregg
Zaun's fly ball into a triple.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is exactly the kind of pitching we need to get this thing
going,'' Hoffman said. ``Those are the plays that can set a team
back. We need to prove we can keep moving forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Closing up: Shaw was ready to pitch the ninth, but when Raul
Mondesi hit a three-run homer in the top of the inning, Hoffman
went to Antonio Osuna for the non-save situation. ``Osuna had been
up in the eighth, so he was ready,'' Hoffman said. ``We're in
stretch where we play 16 games without a day off. Everybody will
get work.''

COYOTES' BEST MAN TURNS GROOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe you can't judge a man by the company he keeps. But when
Wayne Gretzky clears out his schedule just for the pleasure of
watching you sweat in a tuxedo . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``A television crew wanted to be there,'' the Coyotes' Rick
Tocchet said. ``But I felt kind of weird about that. What if Gretz
was doing a shot and the cameras are in his face?''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, not exactly a milk mustache. But what do you expect when
an old-school throwback takes a dive for the first time in his
life?
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Tocchet will exchange vows with his fiancee, Lynne
Wilke, at a Phoenix resort. Along with Gretzky, guys like Paul
Coffey, Kevin Stevens, Rob Blake and Tony Granato have flown in for
the ceremony. It will follow a golf binge coordinated by Jeremy
Roenick, which comes in the wake of a bachelor party in Toronto
attended by 120 of his closest friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really not nervous,'' said Tocchet, 34. ``She's been
through a lot with me the last four-five years. I've been traded so
much, she's been living with me out of a duffel bag. Besides, I've
gotten all those Philly-Pittsburgh days out of my system.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, much has changed for Tocchet since arriving in Phoenix.
Plagued by back problems the previous two seasons, Tocchet
reaffirmed his spot among the league's top players in 1997-98. He
scored 26 goals before busting out in the playoffs. He brought
leadership to a team in desperate need of character. And as Keith
Tkachuk remains in Cape Cod, Mass., no closer to a new deal than he
was last summer, it's clear who is setting the tone for next
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody should be ticked off,'' Tocchet said. ``I
can't see anyone going into the summer feeling good about last
season. For some reason, this organization thought it was OK to
mess around for three months, then make a push in the last
two-three months. It doesn't work that way. I believe this team
really has to have a good start in October. None of this .500 at
Christmas stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   They are words that need to be heard, and if you don't believe
the ``C'' belongs on Tocchet's sweater, you haven't been paying
attention. Tocchet has already influenced the off-season habits of
his teammates, and by his suggestion, Oleg Tverdovsky, Jason Doig
and Brad Isbister spent the summer in Los Angeles working out with
Tocchet's private trainer. He has also talked to Roenick constantly
since the season ended and has lit a new fire under his teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing about our young guys is they're always asking
questions,'' Tocchet said. `` `How was the Stanley Cup?' `What was
Mario Lemieux like?' `How was it when you went to the Finals?'
That's a big thrill for me, and a good sign for this
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   What this all represents is a shifting of the dressing room,
implicit acknowledgment that Tocchet is far more qualified than
Tkachuk when it comes to leadership. It is a touchy subject for
Tocchet, a guy who would never undermine a teammate and whose only
focus is winning. But he admits Tkachuk's priorities are a topic of
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure a lot of people are thinking that right now,''
Tocchet said. ``It's a bad situation for Keith because he's getting
a lot of negativity from the fans. It's too bad because if people
got to know him, he's really a good guy and he wants to win. It's
just a situation where things are real confused right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Real ridiculous, too. But if Tkachuk misses even a day of
training camp, at least the Coyotes have a window in which to shift
the captaincy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I want Keith here,'' Tocchet said. ``Will it happen? I
don't know. But either way, it has to get rectified early so we can
go into the season positively. You only have so many chances to
win, so many notches on your belt, and then you're done.''
</P>
<P>
   A feeling that will ring home in a different way on Sunday.
``I'm ready,'' he said. ``But, man, getting all the wedding plans
together? I empathize with people.'' &QL;

YANKEES SHUT OUT RANGERS, 6-0
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The New York Yankees arrived in town
yesterday in one of their worst slumps of the season. Then Chuck
Knoblauch hit the third pitch of the game over the left-field
fence.
</P>
<P>
   That's all left-hander David Wells needed while pitching a
six-hit shutout in the Yankees' 6-0 victory against the Rangers
before a sellout crowd of 45,841 at The Ballpark in Arlington last
night.
</P>
<P>
   The victory kept the Yankees from matching a season-high,
three-game losing streak and was their seventh in nine games
against the Rangers this year. It also put them back on their
record-breaking victory pace after losing two games against the
Minnesota Twins. The Yankees are on pace to win 120 games, which
would shatter the 1906 Chicago Cubs' all-time record of 116
victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their a good team, a complete team,'' Rangers outfielder Juan
Gonzalez said. ``They have everything, good pitching, power,
hitting, bullpen, everything. They're the best team in the majors.
Everybody is trying hard out there, but it was a good night for
Wells. He threw a great game.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankees first baseman Tino Martinez didn't do so bad either,
smashing two home runs off Rangers starter Esteban Loaiza. Derek
Jeter also hit one out against Loaiza, who dropped to 1-3 with a
4.24 earned-run average in seven starts with the Rangers since
being acquired from the Pittsburgh Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to rise to the challenge, but they're a great team,''
Loaiza said. ``I felt great, but those four home runs hurt. They
just hit good pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells (16-2) has been one of the few Yankees starters who has
had trouble against the Rangers, allowing 12 runs in 82/3 innings
against them. That included five runs in six innings in a start
against them Sunday at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Yankees have proved all year that seldom do things
go bad for an extended period of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought David pitched as well as any left-hander has against
us all year,'' said Rangers manager Johnny Oates, whose team was
hitting .320 against left-handers coming into the game. ``He
spotted his fastball well, and his curve got better as the game
went on. His breaking ball was better than the last two times out
against us.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells did walk Mark McLemore to start the first inning and gave
up a couple of singles in the second, but his defense bailed him
out with two crisply turned double plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last game in New York, I was having trouble with my
mechanics,'' Wells said. ``I came out of the game tied, but I
didn't pitch very well. I wanted to redeem myself for last time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers also failed to come through with rallies in the
fifth and sixth innings. Both times they had runners on first and
second with two outs, but Wells struck out Royce Clayton to end the
fifth and Ivan Rodriguez to end the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big out for me was striking out Rodriguez with two men on
base,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Wells: ``After the second or third inning, I settled down
and started pitching my game. I'm very aggressive and move my
pitches in and out. You've got to keep them on their toes. When
you've got to knock them off the plate you do it. I just tried to
battle them.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually it has been the rest of the American League trying to
battle the Yankees, and so far it's been a losing cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to play well against these guys, because it's a team
we might face when we get to the playoffs,'' outfielder Roberto
Kelly said. ``But it's a tough team to beat. You can't make many
mistakes.''

TOBIN DEFENDS FASSEL'S USE OF SEAHORN TO RETURN KICKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin has come to the defense of the New
York Giants' Jim Fassel, under fire for using Pro Bowl cornerback
Jason Seahorn as a kick-return specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Seahorn suffered torn anterior cruciate and medial collateral
ligaments in his right knee in Thursday night's preseason game
against the New York Jets and will be lost for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it's a blow to them,'' Tobin said of the injury
Seahorn suffered in his first-ever pro kickoff return. ``But it's
just an unfortunate thing. You face a two-edged sword. You have to
get guys ready to play. You hope you do not get injuries. But you
can't just not play.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be aware of keeping players healthy. But you can't
be spooked every time you go out there. You can get hurt just
stepping off a bus. You can get hurt in pregame warm-ups. I've had
all those things happen . . . Pretty soon you're chasing ghosts and
afraid of your own shadow, and you don't want that.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobin pointed out that some of the NFL's top defensive backs
have had great success as returners, including Deion Sanders and
Rod Woodson.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're on the firing line, you have to make decisions,''
Tobin said. ``If they don't (pan) out, you're going to get
second-guessed.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Giants players have questioned Fassel's decision to use
Seahorn as a returner, saying it wasn't worth the risk.
</P>
<P>
   Former Giants quarterback Dave Brown, who played for Fassel last
season before signing with the Cardinals in the off-season,
understands why Fassel decided to use Seahorn on special teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something (Jason) always wanted to do,'' Brown said. ``He
has been lobbying for it for three years. It's just one of those
fluke things. The coach's job is to upgrade the team. The Giants
finished last in kickoff returns last year. Why not do it?'' &QL;

YANKEES SHUT OUT RANGERS, 5-0

   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The New York Yankees arrived in town
yesterday in one of their worst slumps of the season. Then Chuck
Knoblauch hit the third pitch of the game over the left-field
fence.
</P>
<P>
   That's all left-hander David Wells needed while pitching a
six-hit shutout in the Yankees' 5-0 victory against the Rangers
before a sellout crowd of 45,841 at The Ballpark in Arlington last
night.
</P>
<P>
   The victory kept the Yankees from matching a season-high,
three-game losing streak and was their seventh in nine games
against the Rangers this year. It also put them back on their
record-breaking victory pace after losing two games against the
Minnesota Twins. The Yankees are on pace to win 120 games, which
would shatter the 1906 Chicago Cubs' all-time record of 116
victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their a good team, a complete team,'' Rangers outfielder Juan
Gonzalez said. ``They have everything, good pitching, power,
hitting, bullpen, everything. They're the best team in the majors.
Everybody is trying hard out there, but it was a good night for
Wells. He threw a great game.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankees first baseman Tino Martinez didn't do so bad either,
smashing two home runs off Rangers starter Esteban Loaiza. Derek
Jeter also hit one out against Loaiza, who dropped to 1-3 with a
4.24 earned-run average in seven starts with the Rangers since
being acquired from the Pittsburgh Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to rise to the challenge, but they're a great team,''
Loaiza said. ``I felt great, but those four home runs hurt. They
just hit good pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells (16-2) has been one of the few Yankees starters who has
had trouble against the Rangers, allowing 12 runs in 82/3 innings
against them. That included five runs in six innings in a start
against them Sunday at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Yankees have proved all year that seldom do things
go bad for an extended period of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought David pitched as well as any left-hander has against
us all year,'' said Rangers manager Johnny Oates, whose team was
hitting .320 against left-handers coming into the game. ``He
spotted his fastball well, and his curve got better as the game
went on. His breaking ball was better than the last two times out
against us.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells did walk Mark McLemore to start the first inning and gave
up a couple of singles in the second, but his defense bailed him
out with two crisply turned double plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last game in New York, I was having trouble with my
mechanics,'' Wells said. ``I came out of the game tied, but I
didn't pitch very well. I wanted to redeem myself for last time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers also failed to come through with rallies in the
fifth and sixth innings. Both times they had runners on first and
second with two outs, but Wells struck out Royce Clayton to end the
fifth and Ivan Rodriguez to end the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big out for me was striking out Rodriguez with two men on
base,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Wells: ``After the second or third inning, I settled down
and started pitching my game. I'm very aggressive and move my
pitches in and out. You've got to keep them on their toes. When
you've got to knock them off the plate you do it. I just tried to
battle them.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually it has been the rest of the American League trying to
battle the Yankees, and so far it's been a losing cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to play well against these guys, because it's a team
we might face when we get to the playoffs,'' outfielder Roberto
Kelly said. ``But it's a tough team to beat. You can't make many
mistakes.''

METS SPLIT DOUBLEHEADER WITH CARDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs to update; contains second game of doubleheader)  (lh) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bobby Valentine knew he would be second-guessed for
waiting too long to pinch-hit Mike Piazza in the first game of a
10-5 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals at Shea Stadium. But the Mets'
manager's decision to go to a six-man rotation has worked out fine.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, the Mets' sixth starter, Armando Reynoso, tossed
seven scoreless innings to win the second game, 1-0, on Edgardo
Alfonzo's first-inning home run.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-year-old right-hander won his fifth consecutive start and
lowered his earned run average to a stingy 1.54.
</P>
<P>
   There were boos when Reynoso walked Mark McGwire in the first
inning, after McGwire had delivered a pinch-hit double in his only
at-bat in the first game. But Reynoso went on to strike out the
home run leader three times to end innings, twice with a runner on
first base. And the sell-out crowd of 52,320 gave Reynoso hearty
rounds of applause after each strikeout, especially in the seventh,
when McGwire took a called third strike.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, secured after Turk Wendell and John Franco each
pitched a scoreless inning, enabled the Mets (71-57) to tie the
Cubs in the National League wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his unconventional decision to go to a six-man
rotation in the season's final five weeks, Valentine could have
preened. ``I could probably be convinced to change my mind if
someone gave me a reason,'' he said, ``but I don't see one reason
why.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the opener, though, he did not seem as wise, keeping Piazza
on the bench long enough for the Mets to come up short in the
eighth inning and eventually in the game. The turn of events came
with the Mets down by 6-4 but threatening with the bases loaded and
none out.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine was saving his All-Star catcher to pinch-hit for Mel
Rojas, so Luis Lopez _ batting two spots ahead of Rojas _ hit with
the bases loaded while Piazza watched from the dugout. Lopez
grounded into a double play, which gave the Mets one run, but gave
the Cardinals two big outs. As Piazza then watched from the on-deck
circle, Jorge Fabregas grounded out with the tying run on third for
the final out of the inning. A three-run rally had come up one run
short. Piazza had never come up at all.
</P>
<P>
   So Rojas, who had already allowed a run in the eighth, took the
mound for the Cardinals' ninth and allowed four more runs to put
the game beyond the reach of the Mets.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he had thought about pinch-hitting the
right-handed Piazza for Lopez against the St. Louis right-hander
Rich Croushore, Valentine said: ``Yes, there were thoughts.
Obviously, I should have done it. A double play was the only thing
that was going to get me there. And it got us. I just didn't think
the guy was a ground-ball, double-play pitcher. I should have hit
Mike, no doubt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Had the Mets been able to tie the game or go ahead in the
eighth, Valentine would not have had to send Rojas out for the
ninth, either. But the manager said he was confident that Lopez
would do anything but what he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to have a shot to hit Mike with one
out,'' Valentine said. ``Luis is a good fastball hitter. I'm just
sitting there saying, `Anything but a double play.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were trailing 6-2 entering the eighth, when Jermaine
Allensworth grounded a pinch-hit single off Lance Painter to open
the inning. John Olerud followed by lining a single to left and
Edgardo Alfonzo, who was pinch-hitting for Matt Franco, walked to
load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   That brought on Croushore, who walked Brian McRae to make it
6-3, then allowed a single up the middle to Carlos Baerga for
another run. Lopez's turn was next.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mike does hit and doesn't drive in a run, we're looking at
Fabregas and Ordonez next,'' Valentine said, referring to his
backup catcher and Rey Ordonez, the only other position player
besides Piazza available to Valentine off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine rolled the dice and let Lopez bat. And on a 2-1 pitch,
Lopez grounded hard to first baseman John Mabry, who started the
double play. And Rojas proceeded to let the game get away in the
ninth, while allowing a pinch-hitting Mark McGwire, who did not
start the opener, a ground-rule double off Alfonzo's glove at third
to score a run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to squeak by both ways,'' Valentine said, explaining
that he had tried to conserve both his pitching and his bench.
</P>
<P>
   The manager had also tried to squeak an extra inning out of
Hideo Nomo (5-11), who was once again beset by control problems.
Nomo was asked if he found it strange that he has had little
success this season, even though nobody has been able to hit him.
``I don't think it's strange,'' Nomo said. ``Runners are getting on
by other means.''
</P>
<P>
   Like walks. After he struck out the game's first three batters
on 11 pitches, it was apparent that Nomo had good stuff. It became
equally apparent, though, that he did not know where his pitches
were going.
</P>
<P>
   Which was nothing new. Nomo entered the game trailing only
Darryl Kile of Colorado in walks allowed in the National League.
And after Nomo walked six more batters Friday night, he and Kile
were tied with 86. With 86 walks in 1372/3 innings, the
right-hander is averaging 5.6 walks every nine innings. That is one
reason his record is so poor, even though he entered the day third
in the league in strikeouts per nine innings and third in
opponents' batting average.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Nomo was charged with four runs on five hits in
five-plus innings. He struck out eight, but of his 109 pitches, 50
were balls.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo allowed a homer to Ron Gant leading off the second, and
before the inning was over he hit Fernando Tatis with a pitch and
walked Eli Marrero and Matt Morris, the pitcher. Somehow, he
escaped with the Mets trailing by only 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, the Cardinals scratched out another run to make it
2-0. Light-hitting Luis Ordaz opened with an infield single and
took second when Lopez's high throw from shorstop sailed into the
photographers' box behind first base. Nomo then struck out Delino
DeShields for the third time, but allowed a run-scoring single to
Willie McGee.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets struggled through four innings against Morris, a former
Seton Hall right-hander, who quickly retired the first two batters
in the fifth. But Tony Phillips doubled to left with two out and
one pitch later Lenny Harris launched his second home run of the
season. Just like that, the score was 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo took the mound for the sixth, but after a walk to Tatis and
a single by Marrero, Valentine had seen enough. In came Greg
McMichael, whose first pitch to Morris sailed to the backstop,
nearly hitting Morris as he squared to bunt. The runners advanced
to second and third.
</P>
<P>
   In came the infield. On a 2-2 pitch, Morris grounded a single to
left for a 3-2 lead. With runners on first and third, McMichael
rallied to strike out pinch-hitter Ray Lankford. But then the Mets
botched their second rundown in two days and cost themselves
another run.
</P>
<P>
   DeShields started the play by grounding to Olerud at first. He
threw home when he saw Marrero make a move from third. Fabregas did
his job by running Marrero back toward third. But when Matt Franco,
the third baseman, ran Marrero back toward home and tried to toss
the ball to Olerud, who was backing up the play at home, Fabregas
got in the way and screened the play. Marrero was able to swipe the
plate with his left hand before Olerud could apply the tag.
</P>
<P>
   The book was closed on Nomo, but not on the inning. After McGee
lined to Olerud for the second out, Jordan delivered a run-scoring
single to left, and it was 5-2 Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH:
</P>
<P>
   Butch Huskey, in his first game of a rehabilitation assignment
at Class AAA Norfolk, was 1-for-4 with two runs batted in as the
designated hitter. ... The Mets issued 12 walks in the first game
of Friday night's doubleheader, their most in a nine-inning game
since 1983.

D-BACKS GO WITHOUT MUCH FIGHT  
 DAAL PITCHES WELL BUT STILL CAN'T NOTCH WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The Diamondbacks began a new millenium here
Friday night. To their frustration, it looked a lot like the old
millenium.
</P>
<P>
   They became the first team in the major leagues to strike out
1,000 times this season in a 1-0 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies
at Veterans Stadium. They finished with eight, giving them 35 in
the three-game series and 1,003 for the season. Arizona (48-81)
lost two of the games.
</P>
<P>
   Who baffled the Diamondbacks? Right-hander Mark Portugal, 35, a
man who seemingly would look more comfortable in a recliner with a
cigarette in his mouth, a beer in one hand and a TV remote control
in the other.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal, who missed most of his first season with Philadelphia
in 1997 after having elbow surgery, won his first home game for the
team by scattering five hits and striking out six in 7 innings. It
also was the 100th victory of his career and eighth of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-luck loser was left-hander Omar Daal (6-8), who gave up
nine hits, walked one and struck out five in 7 innings. Daal, whose
ERA still dropped from 2.58 to 2.49, has watched his team fail to
score in his past three losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about the way I pitched,'' he said. ``If I keep
throwing the ball like that, I know that sometime it (offensive
production) will turn around. It's not easy, but I have to do what
I can do. I just have to be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   The lone run came in the fourth inning, when Gregg Jefferies
doubled to left field with two outs and scored on a soft single to
shallow right-center by Mark Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a slider down and away,'' Daal said. ``He (Lewis)
didn't hit the ball well, but he hit it in the right spot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks got a pair of hits off Portugal in the first
inning (by Andy Fox and Travis Lee), but couldn't put a run on the
board. Third baseman Matt Williams hit a fly ball to right to end
the inning.
</P>
<P>
   It was the beginning of a particularly frustrating night for
Williams, who was 3 for 45 against Portugal entering the game and
was hitless in three trips this time. He also struck out against
reliever Wayne Gomes to end what appeared to be a promising eighth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   The strikeout parade began in the second inning with Jay Bell
(No. 996) and continued with Damian Miller in the second (997), Lee
in the fourth, Fox in the sixth, followed by the next batter,
Bernard Gilkey, for No. 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter gave credit to Portugal, but
said his hitters could have done a better job of recognizing
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens with a lot of young players like we have, but after
129 games, you'd think we'd do a better job of it. Some are getting
it, some aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal was successful with all his pitches _ fastball,
curveball, slider and change-up _ and Showalter said he pitched
``backward'' _ throwing more off-speed pitches when he was behind
in the count instead of his fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the first inning, the Diamondbacks' best chance to
score came in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal gave up a smash to Fox down the right-field line, but
the ball caromed off the stands that jut about two-thirds of the
way down the line, and went into the air, where right fielder Ruben
Amaro retrieved it.
</P>
<P>
   Fox made the wide turn, and saw Amaro fire the ball toward the
bag, where Portugal was waiting. Portugal caught the ball and made
the quick tag for the out, called by plate umpire Wally Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to take an aggressive turn like that,'' Showalter
said. ``You couldn't have done better if someone in the stands had
thrown it (to Amaro).''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal walked Gilkey, and left-hander Yorkis Perez entered the
game. He walked White but struck out Lee, then giving way to the
right-handed Gomes (victim of a five-run, eighth-inning rally by
the Diamondbacks in the second game of a doubleheader Thursday).
</P>
<P>
   Gomes struck out Williams. In the ninth, he walked Bell, the
leadoff man, but Bell was quickly erased on a 4-6-3 double-play
grounder by David Dellucci. Pinch-hitter Karim Garcia flied out to
center to end the game, giving Gomes his first save. &QL;

DODGERS BEAT MARLINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Adrian Beltre was on the bench for a few games this
week, but he was hardly sitting on his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre knows he is the Dodgers' future at third base, but after
watching Bobby Bonilla start four consecutive games, all he could
think about was doing what is takes to play now.
</P>
<P>
   So he went to the batting cage with coach Manny Mota and to the
video room with hitting instructor Mickey Hatcher. He came out
Friday night with an RBI single and game-winning homer in a 5-1
victory over the Florida Marlins in front of 19,857 at Pro Player
Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Mondesi hit a three-run homer in the ninth and Chan Ho Park
went eight strong innings for his 11th victory and the Dodgers
second straight win.
</P>
<P>
   But this was Beltre's night for many reasons. His promotion from
Double-A two months ago has been questioned. He was playing and
flailing as the team dropped further behind the pack.
</P>
<P>
   But his talent was never an issue. Friday, he showed why.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy is Raul Mondesi at a third base,'' Eric Karros said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, to be 20 with those kinds of skills,'' said Bonilla, who
will have his tender left wrist examined today. ``Adrian Beltre is
something to behold.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla has asked the Dodgers for an anti-inflammatory shot,
which means Beltre should be back in the lineup today against the
Braves in Atlanta. Bonilla played well during his time in the
lineup, but nobody forgot about Beltre.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all the extra work showed how much he wants this,''
Mota said of Beltre. ``I also told him to just be in the dugout and
watch how the pitchers set up hitters. We also threw him 75
breaking balls a day and tonight he hit a breaking ball for a home
run.''
</P>
<P>
   It came in the sixth with the scored tied 1-1 against
right-hander Livan Hernandez (10-9), who lost but threw 144 pitches
for a club-high eighth complete game. Hernandez retired the first
two batters in the inning, but Beltre worked the count to 3-2.
Hernandez threw a curve and Beltre drove it over the 20-foot fence
in left field.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre is batting just .224. Thursday he went 0 for 4 and Friday
he had a throwing error. But his offense lifted the spirits of a
team desperately trying to put together a winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers and Detroit Tigers are the only major-league teams
not to win four consecutive games this season.
</P>
<P>
   The victory moved the Dodgers back to .500 (64-64) and drew them
within seven games of the New York Mets and Chicago Cubs in the
wild-card race with 34 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Park played a big role in the victory, limiting the Marlins to
four hits and one run. He was best in the third inning when he
struck out the side after left fielder Matt Luke misplayed Gregg
Zaun's fly ball into a triple.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, Park should have been out of the inning, but
second baseman Eric Young booted Cliff Floyd's two-out grounder.
Park got out of it when Beltre grabbed Kevin Orie's sharp
one-hopper and threw to second for the force out. Antonio Osuna
pitched a scoreless ninth, striking out two.
</P>
<P>
   If Bonilla's wrist is sound, he is going to play as long as the
Dodgers believe they are in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started to show some improvements when Bobby moved into
third base,'' manager Glenn Hoffman said. ``That is no reflection
on Adrian. He's here because we want him to play and to succeed.
But these are big games for this organization. He can learn even if
he's not playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Beltre said that part of his education has come from listening
to players whose job he is trying to take.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby Bo has been through a lot and he is showing me how to
handle myself,'' Beltre said. ``When he was playing and I was
watching he would take me aside and told me why he did things a
certain way. He doesn't have to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bonilla sees it differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is part of the beauty of the game,'' he said. ``When I
was coming up in the Pirates organization, that guy for me was
Willie Stargell. This is a hard game and you need people to help
you along.''

STATES WILL RECEIVE DRUG FOR PUBLIC USE IN NUCLEAR MISHAPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for additions, refinements and clarifications. Final 8 grafs
are new.)  (lh) 
 By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ After years of resistance, the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission is preparing to distribute to states with
nuclear power plants a drug that blocks a type of radiation that
causes thyroid cancer, and already, people in Connecticut and other
states are clamoring for the medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The move was spurred, in part, by new evidence about thyroid
cancer after the 1986 nuclear accident at Chernobyl, and the lower
incidence of the disease in areas where the drug, potassium iodide,
was widely used.
</P>
<P>
   The policy change also comes at a time when the nuclear agency
is revisiting many regulations and addressing what many critics of
the nuclear power industry say were the agency's weakest policies.
</P>
<P>
   Although the federal government, which stockpiles potassium
iodide, had previously argued that the drug ight cause dangerous
side effects and give people a false sense of security during an
accident, some critics had accused the agency of declining to offer
it out of a concern that it would promote fears of a nuclear
accident.
</P>
<P>
   The NRC oversees the states' emergency plans in case of nuclear
disaster. Although potassium iodide has been available for medical
use for about 20 years, the agency does not require states to
distribute it after a nuclear accident. But over the last year, the
agency has taken steps to encourage states to do so, and has agreed
to pay for the supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Alabama, Tennessee and Maine are stockpiling the
medicine at evacuation centers, while Ohio is moving toward
requesting a supply. New York is reconsidering its refusal to
provide the medicine to the public, and Kristine Smith, a state
Health Department spokeswoman, said that only last month, a
departmental advisory committee of physicians concluded that access
to potassium iodide in a nuclear accident would benefit public
health.
</P>
<P>
   In Waterford, only a few miles from the Millstone nuclear power
station, residents told a state nuclear policy panel Thursday night
that they wanted the drug, which is available in pill form. ``I
want it in my purse,'' said Billie Staub, 66, a retired
correctional officer from Niantic. ``I want my children and
grandchildren to have it at the ready.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the evening, the state panel, the Nuclear Energy
Advisory Commission, had voted 9-2, with one abstention, to
recommend that the state distribute the pills to residents living
within five miles of the Millstone plant, which until last month
had been shut down for more than two years because of safety
concerns. The Connecticut Health Department, in conjunction with
other state agencies, is considering the recommendation.

   The use of potassium iodide to block radiation is not new. It
has been used in other countries, including Poland, for a number of
years, and Peter G. Crane, an NRC staff lawyer who has lobbied as a
private citizen to change the agency's policy, said it was approved
by the Food and Drug Administration for medical use in this country
in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Today it costs about 7 cents a pill and can be sold over the
counter, although it is not available at pharmacies because it
serves no other medical purpose, Crane said. It has a shelf life of
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear power regulators, physicians and government health
officials emphasized Friday that potassium iodide should not be
viewed as a cure-all for diseases caused by radioactivity from a
nuclear accident. It blocks only one of many isotopes _ radioactive
iodine _ that may be emitted from a leak or meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if no action is taken, radioactive iodine is absorbed by
the thyroid gland, where it can cause cancer and other disorders. A
130-milligram dose of potassium iodide can prevent radioactive
iodine from entering the thyroid for several days if taken within a
few hours of exposure to radiation, health officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question about its effectiveness,'' said Jacob
Robbins, former president of the American Thyroid Association and a
scientist emeritus at the National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some civil defense and public health officials harbor
doubts about whether providing it is a good idea. They said people
may misunderstand what the drug does and fail to evacuate when
ordered to. And it is not clear how state officials will make sure
that everyone who lives close to an accident site and needs the
pills will get them.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Maurer, a spokesman for the New York state Emergency
Management Office, said the state contends that in a nuclear
accident, the pills would be a distraction. ``The bottom line is
that we intend to have people out of harm's way before they would
need potassium iodide,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the question of liability if people who take the
pills suffer side effects. Connecticut and other states are
considering whether to require people to sign release forms before
they are given the pills.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Lou Fleissner, the Connecticut Health Department's director
of environmental epidemiology, said the side effects of potassium
iodide include a risk of cardiac arrest in people with already high
levels of potassium.
</P>
<P>
   But Crane, who has thyroid cancer, caused by exposure to
radiation as a child, has lobbied for 10 years to make the drug
more available. He downplayed the risks and said the use of
potassium iodide after the Chernobyl accident provided strong
evidence of its effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robbins said that while there was a high number of thyroid
cancer cases _ as many as 1,200 _ in Ukraine and other Soviet
republics that did not use potassium iodide, the number was much
smaller in Poland, where the drug was distributed to about 10
million people immediately after the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were very few cases of any kind of trouble because of
potassium iodide,'' he said, referring to side effects. Older
people tend to have more problems with the drug than younger
people, but they are also less susceptible to thyroid cancer, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Crane also dismissed contentions that if the drug is widely
distributed, residents of the affected areas will become complacent
and resist evacuation efforts.
</P>
<P>
   He explained: ``Evacuation is the best option if you can get
people out, but you can't always get people out. You can have
weather conditions or interruption of the roads. You can have
people getting a dose of radiation while they evacuate. The real
issue is: Do you want three arrows or two in your quiver? The point
is: At minimal cost, you get an extra arrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of making potassium iodide available after a nuclear
accident was raised as early as 1979 by the Kemeny Commission,
which issued a report following the accident at Three Mile Island
in Pennsylvania about ways to make nuclear power more safe.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, the NRC adopted regulations that called for making
potassium iodide available to emergency workers, but not to the
neighbors of nuclear plants.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, the agency has reconsidered that policy.
First, it adopted the recommendation last year of a federal panel
of experts that potassium iodide should be provided to states that
request it. Then last month, the agency said it planned to require
every state to consider offering potassium iodide as part of its
emergency preparedness plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This action is not being taken because of any new insights
about risks associated with operating nuclear power, but rather in
recognition of the European experience during and following the
Chernobyl accident,'' an agency statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Crane, who filed the petition that led to the agency's decision
earlier this summer, said the agency's previous position was based
not only on health considerations, but also on concerns about
discrediting the industry. ``They were worried that if you prepared
too well for an accident, it sends the message that accidents can
happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in Waterford, some residents expressed dismay over the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't tell me it's safe and then come up with things to do
`just in case,''' said Michael T. Kruse, 45, a manager for a
sporting-goods manufacturer. ``If they're talking about things like
this, there must be a reason.''
</P>
<P>
   And several people said they would not take the medicine even if
they had it. ``They'd have to be darned good pills,'' said Gerry K.
Wade, 55, a waitress at the Village Stop diner. ``Whatever there is
to catch, we're all going to catch it.''

GLAUS' SEASON SPANS 12 MONTHS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Ah, to be 22.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Glaus feels fresh despite playing nearly every day since
last August, when he began playing in the Arizona Instructional
League after signing with the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   From there he went to Winter Ball in Venezuela, to spring
training in Arizona, to Double-A Midland, to Triple-A Vancouver and
finally to the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me the other day he's had about 900 at-bats since
August,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said. ``That's a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaus went into Friday's game hitting .225 with one home run and
12 RBI in 19 games, but the Angels aren't worried about his
offense. That will come around. They are especially pleased with
his defense and his poise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Troy Glaus has handled himself great,'' Collins said. ``He
doesn't act like he's been around five years. He knows he's a young
player, which is why he has respect. The veterans respect young
guys that approach it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   On McGwire: The Angels don't have to face Mark McGwire because
he's in the National League, but Collins said the home run-record
chase would have to take a back seat to the pennant race.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in the pennant hunt, you probably pitch around Mark
McGwire,'' he said. ``I would in a pennant race. Whether he's got
51 homers or 41, he's a guy you pitch around.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad film form: Collins was a tad upset with Fox Sports for how
they edited highlights of Thursday's game. Fox showed a video clip
of Collins waving to a child of a friend in the stands between
innings. But that's not why Collins was upset.
</P>
<P>
   He was angry because when Fox Sports News showed highlights of
the game, they showed Garret Anderson hitting a double off the
wall, followed by the clip of Collins waving while the on-air
anchor said something to the effect: ``Angels manager Terry Collins
waves bye-bye to a Garret Anderson double in the Angels' 13-2 over
the Tigers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was (Tigers manager) Buddy Bell, I'd want to kill me,''
Collins said. ``It looked like I was showing them up.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels adds: Pitcher Ken Hill felt fine during a sideline
workout Friday and is scheduled to make a rehab start Sunday for
Single-A Lake Elsinore. If all goes well, Hill could start next
weekend in Boston.... The Angels placed utility player Craig
Shipley on the disabled list Friday because of a strained left
hamstring. Paco Martin was activated from the DL to take Shipley's
place.... The Angels went over the two million mark in attendance
Thursday night for the first time since the 1993 season. It was the
15th time in club history attendance has surpassed two million.

PIAZZA BOOED AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If the fans at Shea Stadium want Mike Piazza back
next season, they continue to have a strange way of showing it.
While the St. Louis Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire's every move was
cheered during Thursday night's doubleheader, Piazza was once again
the target of boos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just more of the same,'' Mets General Manager Steve Phillips
said of the booing of Piazza, who had a tough time at the plate and
in the field in the doubleheader until he pounded a towering home
run in Game 2 that helped spark the Mets' 5-4 comeback victory.
</P>
<P>
   After the home run, the fans did a 180-degree reversal and
demanded a curtain call from Piazza. Piazza obliged, even though
one of his teammates, Turk Wendell, said Friday that he would not
have done so if he were Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised they actually asked me to do it,'' Piazza
said. ``I didn't put us ahead or tie it. But it was flattering.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza heard resounding cheers on Tuesday night, when his
dramatic pinch-hit three-run double gave the Mets a doubleheader
sweep of Colorado. The good feelings carried over to Wednesday
night, when he got an ovation as he strode to the plate against the
Rockies with the bases loaded. The roar got even louder when he
lined a run-scoring single, a big hit in a game the Mets won by
2-1.
</P>
<P>
   But 24 hours later, the booing was back.
</P>
<P>
   As for the renewed jeers, Piazza said: ``What's the big deal?
They've booed everyone here. They booed Reggie Jackson. It's part
of the territory about playing here. You have to block everything
out. I try to. And I think I do a pretty good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Piazza knows what goes through his mind when he hears the
boos, which began earlier in the season when he repeatedly failed
in clutch situations for the Mets. In recent weeks, the booing
seemed to bother him, but Friday he appeared to shrug it off. He
smiled, joked and at times seemed downright jovial.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been because he had the first game of Friday night's
doubleheader off after playing all 18 innings on Thursday. Or, as
he insisted, it may have been mind over reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, I'm really not spending a significant
amount of time pondering the situation,'' Piazza said.
</P>
<P>
   Others do, as anyone who has listened to sports-talk radio shows
would attest. As Phillips admitted, when asked if the booing would
have a negative effect on any contract negotiations Piazza might
have with the Mets: ``I think it's safe to say it will make it more
difficult. In any negotiation, a player has to be motivated to
stay. I mostly feel bad for Mike. It's not an easy thing to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked Friday if he might not want to return because of the
booing, Piazza said: ``I can't answer that. But I don't see the big
debate. I consider it the way this town has always been. And not
only this one.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's Nemesis
</P>
<P>
   Turk Wendell has struck out Mark McGwire three times in the last
week, twice with games on the line. So Wendell could afford to joke
a little about his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray Lankford bothers me more than McGwire,'' Wendell said
Friday. ``Lankford hits me better.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nobody lately has been hitting Wendell, who picked up
the save in the second game of Wednesday's doubleheader with two
scoreless innings. The quirky reliever, who had been buried in the
Mets' bullpen the first four months of the season, had not allowed
a run in his last 10 appearances _ a span of 11 innings _ coming
into last night's doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
   Wendell is now entrenched as the right-handed set-up man for
closer John Franco. And the crowd at Shea appeared to be rooting
for Wendell when he struck out McGwire in the top of the eighth on
Wednesday night. On all his other at-bats, the crowd was rooting
for McGwire, who belted his 50th and 51st homers during the
doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
   Jones Volunteers
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Jones will start for the Mets Saturday afternoon on three
days' rest. ``It wasn't my idea, it was his,'' Manager Bobby
Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine had been leaning toward recalling right-hander Octavio
Dotel from Class AAA Norfolk for a spot start. But the game would
have been Dotel's major-league debut, and the Mets are in the
middle of a wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I'd rather not bring in an unknown,'' Valentine
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he told Valentine, `` `I don't know what your options
are for Saturday, but if you need somebody, I'd be willing to
pitch.''' Which means that Jones' back does not seem to be
bothering him that much anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I thought it would bother me by pitching on three days'
rest, there is no way I'd even be thinking about it,'' Jones said.

RED SOX POUND TWINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ The votes have been counted in all precincts, from
Barnstable County on the Cape to Cumberland County in Maine, and
it's unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   As far as New England is concerned, Nomar Garciaparra gets no
more days off from now until as deep into autumn as the Red Sox
play this season.
</P>
<P>
   A day after being given a rare breather by manager Jimy
Williams, Garciaparra hit a three-run home run Friday night that
threatened to scrape some Teflon off the roof of the Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   With that fourth-inning blast, which came two innings after
Damon Buford's three-run homer started Boston toward a 9-2 win over
the Minnesota Twins, Garciaparra became just the fifth shortstop in
Red Sox history to drive in 100 or more runs in a season.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, who added his 101st RBI with an eighth-inning
single, is no threat this season to break the big league record for
RBIs by a shortstop, 159 by Vern Stephens of the Sox in 1949. But
he joined Stephens, John Valentin, Joe Cronin, and Rico Petrocelli
as 100-RBI Sox shortstops, and he did it in just his 108th game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice group to be in; to be mentioned with those guys is
definitely an honor,'' Garciaparra said. ``But I'd like my name
next to the 1918 Red Sox, too. We'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox still have a long way to go before they can join the
company of the '18 World Series ringbearers, but with Friday
night's win, they drew a significant step closer toward playing in
October. The win, coupled with the Orioles' 6-3 loss to the Indians
Friday night, gave the Red Sox an eight-game edge in the American
League wild-card race with 36 games left.
</P>
<P>
   The win went to pitcher Steve Avery, who, if it had been put to
the vox populi last Sunday, probably would have faced impeachment
proceedings. Instead, the lefthander, who openly questioned how
long he could hold on to his spot in the rotation, pitched seven
innings in which he allowed three singles and Matt Lawton's
bases-empty homer, the only run he permitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, you don't always like to be under the gun,'' said
Avery, now 9-5 just five days after the Twins bombed him for nine
hits and six runs in Fenway Park, ``but I told you I'm not going to
let it affect me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the same desire to win. It's not always going to
happen, but you still go out with everything you have. I use my
heart, my mind. Even tonight, my stuff wasn't that good.''
</P>
<P>
   But his defense was, especially in the fourth inning when second
baseman Mike Benjamin and first baseman Mo Vaughn both made leaping
grabs of line drives, sandwiched around one of Garciaparra's
trademark across-the-body throws from deep in the hole to nab Marty
Cordova.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reverse slam dunk,'' Benjamin said of his full extension to
catch Brent Gates's liner. ``I stuck the landing, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Twins reliever Todd Ritchie had a right to be shocked when
Garciaparra stuck it to him by launching his 3-and-0 pitch into the
outer reaches of the Metrodome in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time this season Garciaparra had swung at a
3-and-0 pitch. On 23 previous occasions, he'd passed up the chance.
Last season, in the same number of chances, he swung just three
times and put two balls in play, once for a single.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it depends on whether you get the green light,''
said Garciaparra, who normally is given the go-ahead to swing away
by manager Jimy Williams. ``Sometimes you don't feel good.
Sometimes you don't want to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight I was thinking, `Is he going to give it to me? I hope
he does,' because I had a feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   That feeling translated into Garciaparra's 26th home run of the
season. It followed an RBI ground single by Vaughn under the glove
of first baseman Ron Coomer, who would have rescued Ritchie from
further damage had he made what would have been an inning-ending
play.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Vaughn's ball eluded Coomer's backhand attempt,
Benjamin scored on the play to make it 4-0, and Garciaparra
followed with a 394-foot drive into the left-center-field seats,
the ninth time this season he has hit a two-run home run.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, whose eighth-inning single scored Valentin after a
walk and wild pitch, now has three more RBIs than he did as Rookie
of the Year in 1997. Sports Illustrated, for one, already has
declared that he should be the AL Most Valuable Player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry about things like that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the time has come for opposing pitchers to start
worrying about Buford, whose home run came off rookie lefthander
Eric Milton, who had held the Red Sox hitless for five innings last
weekend in Boston but was lifted after walking five of the 11
batters he faced Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Buford followed two of those walks, to Mike Stanley and Troy
O'Leary starting the second, with his ninth home run, giving the
Sox a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of Buford's home runs have come with men on base: a grand
slam, two three-runners, and four with a man aboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't even thought about that,'' Buford said. ``I don't
want to think about there being men on base, because I might try to
do too much.''
</P>
<P>
   What he's done, as the Sox' leading hitter against lefthanded
pitchers, has been more than his share. Like a certain shortstop
who may soon be adding three initials to his name.

MARIJUANA USE RISING ACROSS NATION, GOVERNMENT STUDY FINDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BROOKE OLSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A just-released study shows that teen-age drug
use is rising, particularly marijuana use, and experts and teens
alike blame society's glamorization of the illegal weed.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one in 10 youths between 12 and 17 reported having smoked
marijuana at least once in the previous month, according to the
survey, released Friday by the U.S. Health and Human Services
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The 9.4 percent rate of marijuana use among U.S. teen-agers --
an estimated 2.1 million youths &UR;  &LR; -- rose from 7.1 percent in 1996,
the study showed.
</P>
<P>
   Marijuana leaf insignias on shirts and hats and hemp products
such as clothing, paper and even shampoo have created the
perception among teens that marijuana is ``cool'' and relatively
harmless, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never done pot, but I don't think anything would happen
to me if I did do it,'' said Karen Duffy, 17, a senior at suburban
Chatsworth High School. Duffy said most of her friends have tried
marijuana and nothing harmful has ever come from their use.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a bad drug; I don't know why everyone makes such a
stink out of it,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   It's precisely that kind of accepting attitude that makes the
glamorization of marijuana all the more dangerous, said Mary
Kauffman, an adviser for Drug Abuse and Resistance Education, a
national program that teaches students about the dangers of drug
use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time the kids perceive the drugs as not dangerous, or even
beneficial to them, the number of them using the drugs will be on
the rise,'' Kauffman said.
</P>
<P>
   In California, one of two states for which the survey provided
separate data, 6.6 percent of young people reported having used
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Of the youths surveyed nationwide, 11.4 percent used illicit
drugs in 1997, up from 9 percent the previous year. The survey
questioned 24,500 people.
</P>
<P>
   Valley teen-agers said marijuana was easier to obtain than any
other substance illegal to teens -- including alcohol and
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of people selling it. It's not too hard to
find,'' said Michael Kennington, 16, of suburban Northridge. ``With
cigarettes or alcohol, you always have to find someone older to buy
it for you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, everyone is doing it or endorsing it -- you see it on
TV or in the movies, or there's songs about it. It's no big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   At Lions Lair, a novelty and apparel store in suburban Canoga
Park, Mark Herer ticked off the benefits of hemp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marijuana has many different uses -- it actually produces
really good clothing and paper,'' said Herer, assistant manager of
the store and son of Jack Herer, who wrote the pro-hemp book ``The
Emperor Wears No Clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   But experts believe kids' perceptions are being tainted by hemp
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating. We're up against a very powerful medium
that affects kids every day,'' Kauffman said. ``There's not a
moment that goes by where kids aren't being inundated with the
effects of advertising, movies or even fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   The side effects of marijuana use are wide-ranging, and include
everything from medical problems to social stigma, said David
Feinberg, a child analyst and psychologist who specializes in teen
drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chronic marijuana use leads to a motivational syndrome --
what's known as `burnout' -- and that's where you just don't want
to do anything except smoke pot,'' Feinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   In high dosages, marijuana can lead to breast enlargement in
males and decreasing fertility among both sexes, he said. It has
also been linked to lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The most damaging aspect of marijuana is that when bought on the
street, it can contain traces of other drugs, such as PCP or LSD,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marijuana does get laced with stuff, and it can have
devastating consequences,'' Feinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   But teens, especially in California, remain adamant that
marijuana is a low-risk drug. According to the national survey,
Californians were less likely to perceive great risk in using
marijuana than residents in the remainder of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Among other findings from the annual federally funded survey:
</P>
<P>
   --Between 1996 and 1997, illicit drug use increased from 2
percent to 4 percent among 12- and 13-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   --In 1997, 9.1 percent of youths in California and 11.9 percent
of youths in the U.S. were illicit drug users.
</P>
<P>
   --The number of cocaine users did not change significantly in
1997, but there has been an increasing trend in heroin use since
1993. In 1997, 325,000 used it in the past month, approximately 0.2
percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Why do more kids seem to be turning to drugs? L.A.-area teens
listed several reasons, including boredom and eagerness to ``fit
in'' with certain crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just cool to do,'' Kennington said.

YANKS HALT `LOSING STREAK' AT TWO GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ In describing his pitcher's personality, Joe
Torre would refer to David Wells by his nickname this spring and
say, ``The Boomer is the Boomer.'' Wells was not exactly sure what
the New York Yankees manager meant by this, but he guessed it was
not a compliment.
</P>
<P>
   They existed within this spiral of misunderstanding, pitcher and
manager, until Wells nearly blew a 9-0 lead against the Rangers
here on May 6 and Torre suggested Wells might be out of shape. That
led to a meeting two days later, in which they came to know each
other a little better, and the end result has been an era of good
feeling. Wells shut out the Rangers Friday night, 5-0, bringing his
season's performance and his relationship with his manager full
circle.
</P>
<P>
   The victory enabled the Yankees (93-32) to end their losing
streak at two games. They have not lost three consecutive games
since opening the season with three defeats. Tino Martinez hit two
home runs and collected his 100th and 101st runs batted in,
becoming the first Yankee since Don Mattingly to drive in 100 or
more runs in three consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Following the near-disaster against Texas in May, Torre barely
contained his frustration with Wells, questioning his conditioning.
Torre's remarks were relayed to the pitcher. In Minnesota two days
later, Wells initiated a meeting, telling his manager that he felt
Torre and the pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre did not believe in him
or his ability.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering the conversation Friday night, Torre said that he
started to understand how sensitive Wells can be, despite his loud,
direct and in-your-face personality.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, too, seems to have gleaned the knowledge that, above all,
Torre wants to win. ``We're going to butt heads sometimes,'' Wells
said. ``But I respect him tremendously.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells smiled. ``Joe is Joe,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   When Wells departed Texas that night in May, he was 3-1 with a
5.77 earned run average. In the months since, he has pitched a
perfect game, started for the American League in the All-Star Game
and has become a strong candidate for the league's Cy Young Award.
</P>
<P>
   Facing the Rangers Friday night, Wells allowed six hits and a
walk and struck out seven. He is 16-2, matching his career high for
victories, with a 3.26 ERA. He leads the league in shutouts with
four, and Torre on Friday night talked about how Wells has been the
pitcher ``you hang your hat on.'' David Cone started slowly and
improved gradually, Andy Pettitte has struggled intermittently,
Hideki Irabu swooned in midseason. But Wells has been constant most
of the season, with Torre coming to respect his competitiveness.
When Wells battled and scratched to throw six innings Sunday,
despite having poor stuff, Torre made sure to compliment him.
</P>
<P>
   With Wells, everything starts with strike one. He can throw his
92 mile-per-hour fastball for a strike just about every time he
wants, Minnesota Manager Tom Kelly recently told a friend; he can
throw his curve for strikes, he's improving his changeup, and he
challenges everybody. Before Friday night's game, Wells had allowed
only 1.02 runners per inning, the lowest in the AL.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wells threw a first-pitch strike to each of the first five
batters he faced Friday night, and threw first-pitch strikes to 10
of the first 12 hitters. Only in the fifth inning did he appear in
trouble, and that had more to do with the weather than the Rangers.
Heavy winds began to blow and a storm seemed imminent. Despite that
threat, Wells slowed his pace, rather than speed it up.
</P>
<P>
   The rains came and went, and Wells kept on dominating the
Rangers, retiring the last 10 batters he faced. Torre looked down
at the end of the Yankees' bench when his team was batting to see
Wells sitting alone, staring out on the field, his concentration
complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen him throw a lot of good games,'' said Mark McLemore,
the Rangers second baseman who faced Wells when both were growing
up in San Diego. ``But that's the best I've seen him since I faced
him in high school.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Texas Manager Johnny Oates: ``It was one of the best
performances by a left-hander we've seen all season. He spotted his
fastball well, and his curveball and changeup got better as the
game went on.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, Wells paused for a moment when he shook hands
with Torre, and the manager tapped him on the chest. The Boomer is
the Boomer.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH:
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch, who hit a first-inning home run, his 17th, was
hit by a pitch in the lower back in the seventh inning and was
replaced in the bottom of the inning by Luis Sojo.

THREE STOOGES CONVENTION A KNUCKLEHEAD'S DELIGHT? WHY, SOITENLY!
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC MOSES  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The first-ever West Coast convention for fans of
the Three Stooges was supposed to be a nyuk-filled, ``woo-woo''
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it began Friday on a somewhat dour, mysterious note
with the news that someone had hijacked 120 cases of freshly brewed
``Three Stooges'' beer that was being trucked from Atlanta, Ga., to
suburban Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Benjamin, whose mother, Jean DeRita, was married to Curly
Joe DeRita for 27 years before the comic actor's death, was
perplexed by the theft.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is this world coming to?'' said Benjamin, who with his
mother and brother helped found Comedy III Productions Inc. to
promote the Stooges' legacy and control their trademarks.
</P>
<P>
   The beer was supposed to be sampled at a Friday night reception
for the most ardent followers of the Stooges, or in their words
``Very Important Knuckleheads.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the lager is not yet available for sale in California,
those who have tasted it say it doesn't have the bitter taste of a
Heineken, is not a microbrew and goes down like Michelob.
</P>
<P>
   Panther Brewing Co., a Boston-based firm named for a fictional
company the Stooges worked for in one of their nearly 200 film
shorts, has offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the
arrest of the brew-heisters, said Patrick Lauerman, who handles
merchandising for Comedy III Productions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to call in the FBI, CIA and IOU,'' Lauerman said. An
emergency shipment of 10 cases was being flown in to quench the
thirst of the ``VIKs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the weekend get-together at the Burbank Airport Hilton Hotel
and Convention Center was not just about beer, or the lack thereof.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to keep the Stooges alive,'' Jean DeRita said
during a break from signing books and posters with her late
husband's likeness. ``They've made a lot of generations happy, and
we are trying to keep them alive for future generations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Burbank gathering is the first one west of Philadelphia, and
was created because Stooge-o-philes demanded it.
</P>
<P>
   And some, like Leo Wolene, 52, of Northridge, paid for it --
with a pie in the face.
</P>
<P>
   Wolene, a longtime fan, took part in a truly amateur performance
of a famous Stooges scene: Madame Pompadour's birthday bash. With
the usual Stooge hilarity, the fancy affair soon degenerated into a
pie-throwing contest.
</P>
<P>
   For $50, any knucklehead can throw a few shaving-cream pies and
take home a videotape keepsake of the performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind looking silly,'' Wolene said, wiping the gobs of
white foam from his face, nose, hair, neck and ears.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone at the convention seemed to have a favorite Three
Stooges memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucky'' Giorgianni, 70, of Valencia remembers racing to the
movie house in New Brunswick, N.J., to see the latest Stooges
short. Cliff Batham of Mission Hills recalls the night his
Stooge-inspired father picked up a pie and mashed it in his
mother's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every Thanksgiving we talk about it,'' Batham said.
</P>
<P>
   Admission to the convention, which will continue today and
Sunday, is $20 for adults and $10 for children.
</P>
<P>
   Be warned, however. If you attend, you're sure to bump into a
Curly impersonator who will offer his hand in greeting, then as you
reach out, he'll pull his hand away and slap you silly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nyuk-nyuk-nyuk.''

PLAYOFFS BEGIN, AND HOUSTON IS THE TARGET 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MELANIE HAUSER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Will the Women's National Basketball Association playoffs be a
one-team race? Or will this be a down-to-the-wire postseason?
</P>
<P>
   It depends on whom you ask.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the four coaches involved see this as a wide-open race.
And the fourth? Phoenix Coach Cheryl Miller put the pressure
squarely on the favored Houston Comets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's their championship to lose,'' she said in a conference
call on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Rockers may be the hottest team coming in and the
Charlotte Sting may be the luckiest, having slipped in when the
lost to Detroit Wednesday night, but the Comets are the defending
champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's Houston and then there's the rest of us,''
said Miller, who predicted a Houston-Phoenix final last month.
``I've felt like that all season long.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston rolls into Saturday's opening semifinal game in
Charlotte (18-12) with the best record (27-3) and three of the
league's best offensive players.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's Mercury (19-11) travels to Cleveland (20-10) for the
beginning of the other two-of-three-game semifinal round Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Perrot, Houston's point guard, suffered a severely sprained
right ankle in Wednesday night's season finale against Los Angeles.
Coach Van Chancellor said Perrot, who broke the same ankle two
years ago, will probably play in Game 1, but that Janeth Arcain
will start at the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked her if she thought she could play 15 minutes
Saturday,'' Chancellor said of Perrot. ``She acted like she was
insulted. But it's all going to come down to whether she can cut
out there on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Perrot has been the glue for the Comets this season, but the
spotlight has been on Cynthia Cooper, the league's leading scorer
and last year's most valuable player; Sheryl Swoopes (sixth in
scoring) and Tina Thompson. It was Cooper who took over and almost
single-handedly beat the Liberty in the second half of last year's
WNBA finals.
</P>
<P>
   Although there has been some internal friction on the Comets _ a
few weeks ago, Cooper said that some teammates were too concerned
with individual statistics _ Chancellor said reports about it have
been overblown.
</P>
<P>
   ``My answer to that is 27 wins,'' he said. ``You can't win 27
basketball games with all the problems that have been reported.
It's not all peaches and cream, but when we step on the court,
we're a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston is 3-0 against Charlotte this season and beat the Sting,
70-54, in last year's semifinals, while New York beat Phoenix,
59-41. Last season, all playoffs were one game each.
</P>
<P>
   The Sting slipped into the playoffs late Wednesday night after
the Liberty was eliminated by its loss to Detroit coupled with
Phoenix's victory over Sacramento. ``We listened to the last three
minutes of the game in the locker room on a cell phone,'' Coach
Marynell Meadors said of the Phoenix-Sacramento game.
</P>
<P>
   The Sting had a 14-4 start, but stumbled down the stretch. Then,
through a scheduling quirk, Charlotte had five days off and could
do nothing but watch other teams play their way into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland, which nailed down the top of the Eastern Conference
standing Monday night when it defeated the Liberty in New York, now
faces Phoenix and Jennifer Gillom, the second-leading scorer in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of respect for Phoenix,'' Coach Linda
Hill-McDonald said. ``We've struggled against them all three times
we've played them. They've got speed and size and Jennifer
Gillom.'' &QL;

Powell, defense 
keep Brewers 
under control
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
MILWAUKEE _ If the Astros don't know already, Milwaukee isn't the
most charitable locale in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   That would explain the uneasy feeling manager Larry Dierker
began to feel in the seventh inning Friday night when the Astros
watched a two-run lead dwindle to one. Only 24 hours earlier, the
Astros twice blew three-run leads in a 10-inning loss to the
Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't the most confident manager in the major leagues at
that moment,'' Dierker admitted after the Astros pulled away on
Richard Hidalgo's two-run homer in the ninth for a 5-2 victory over
Milwaukee at County Stadium. ``This was a very scary game.
Practically every time, they either beat you or make you sweat it
out because they don't mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, neither did the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   For a club that relies on big sticks, it was the gloves _ and
some solid pitching _ that came in handy as the Astros earned a
split of a two-game series with the Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   By winning, the Astros maintained a 7{-game lead over the
Chicago Cubs in the National League Central heading into a crucial
three-game series beginning today at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's case for the defense:
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo, who went 3-for-5, chased down a deep fly ball by Geoff
Jenkins at the warning track in the fifth inning. On Thursday,
Hidalgo threw out a runner at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning Friday, shortstop Tim Bogar stabbed a line
drive and flipped the ball to second baseman Craig Biggio for an
inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Spiers, who entered the game as a pinch hitter in the
eighth, went airborne for a high chopper along the third-base line
in the ninth inning for the second out.
</P>
<P>
   Toss in a solid pitching effort by righthander Sean Bergman and
2 innings of scoreless relief from Jay Powell, and the Astros had
the ingredients for their seventh win in nine meetings with the
Brewers this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to win a pennant if you can't catch the ball,
no matter how many runs you score,'' said third baseman Sean Berry,
who went 2-for-2 and batted .450 against the Brewers this season.
``We've done a pretty good job this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can attack you a bunch of different ways _ steal bases, hit
home runs and make the great play to stop the runs from scoring.
The pitching is keeping us in the game. All you have to do is keep
us close; we'll find a way to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Bergman (11-6) pitched 4 scoreless innings before Milwaukee
broke through. He allowed two runs and seven hits for his first
victory since July 28.
</P>
<P>
   The righthander, coming off a strong eight-inning outing five
days earlier against the Cubs, didn't allow a run until Marquis
Grissom's single scored Bill Pulsipher in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't nearly as fast or dominating as his last start, but
he was tenacious and kept the ball down pretty well,'' Dierker
said. ``He's been very steady. Obviously, when you pitch almost
seven innings, give up two runs, on the road and at a good hitter's
park, it looks like a great outing, but I think he would tell you
it wasn't his best.''
</P>
<P>
   Bergman concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I pitched well,'' said Bergman. ``I have to give a
lot of credit to the defense. They gave me the opportunities to
win. I feel comfortable, even in the games I've struggled a little
bit. Tonight I wasn't as sharp, but they made some great plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee made it interesting in the seventh when Jenkins led
off with a home run to center on a 2-2 changeup from Bergman,
slicing the Astros' lead to 3-2. After a walk to Fernando Via,
Dierker went to his overused bullpen and inserted Powell, who
allowed only one hit over the final 2 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen had struggled one day earlier in a 6-5 loss to the
Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just try to go out there and get us into the ninth with
the lead _ that's my job,'' Powell said. ``Our goal is to get the
ball to Billy (Wagner) with the lead in the ninth. If we do that,
we'll win a lot of games.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner wasn't available after pitching Thursday, so Powell was
asked to finish.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo put the game out of reach with a two-run shot off
Brewers reliever Bronswell Patrick.
</P>
<P>
   However, runs were in short supply as Bergman and Pulsipher
(1-1) staged a pitching duel early.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Astros didn't understand the math: 17 hits, two
of them home runs, and only five runs in a 10-inning loss. On
Friday, Pulsipher had a one-hitter through four innings _ and the
Astros led 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Pulsipher didn't do himself any favors with five walks, which
led to two of the Astros' runs.
</P>
<P>
   Berry provided two runs with a sacrifice fly in the second
inning and an RBI single in the fourth. Berry went 9-for-20 with
two home runs and six RBIs against the Brewers this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really hot when I got hurt,'' Berry said. ``That
first-at-bat home run (Thursday) was a big lift. It's tough coming
off an injury like that. It kind of slows you down. I wouldn't say
I'm quite 100 percent, but I'm getting the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros made it 3-1 in the sixth inning. Jeff Bagwell, who
walked twice and scored three times, singled to lead off the
inning. Berry singled with one out, and Tony Eusebio followed with
an RBI single to right. That proved to be just enough.

DEVILS' GENERAL MANAGER WANTS END TO LONG SUMMER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By VINCENT M. MALLOZZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST ORANGE, N.J. _ Speaking in a low but firm voice over lunch,
General Manager Lou Lamoriello of the New Jersey Devils said Friday
that the memory of last season's stunning first-round playoff loss
to Ottawa was still hard to swallow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was, quite frankly in my mind, a disaster,'' said
Lamoriello, who watched the Devils skate to the best regular-season
record in the Eastern Conference last season only to be eliminated
in six games by the Senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``What could have gone wrong last season, went wrong, and it's
been a long summer for everyone,'' Lamoriello said. ``We had a
player getting cut with a skate, another getting food-poisoned, but
there are no excuses, because we did not compete the way we should
have.''
</P>
<P>
   With training camp set to open Sept. 12, the Devils are ready to
atone for last season's playoff debacle, which led to the
resignation of the head coach Jacques Lemaire, who brought a
Stanley Cup to New Jersey in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Lemaire, replaced by the assistant Robbie Ftorek, is still with
the Devils' organization in a role that Lamoriello described as a
``special assignment scout.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From the conversations I've had with our players in the
postseason, I have no problem in my mind today knowing what their
attitude is,'' Lamoriello said. ``Character is not something we
lack, and I think this is going to be a very competitive training
camp, because when you have character, you have pride.''
</P>
<P>
   Since drinking from the Stanley Cup, the Devils have strung
together three hard-luck seasons: failing to make the playoffs in
1996, losing to the rival New York Rangers in the second round of
the 1997 playoffs, and losing last season to Ottawa without the
services in Game 6 of center Jason Arnott, whose wrist was cut by a
skate in Game 5, and center Bobby Holik, who had food poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   Lamoriello said Friday that Arnott had another setback three
weeks ago, injuring the middle finger on his left hand in a fishing
accident in Sudbury, Ontario. While Arnott's injury required
surgery, Lamoriello said he should be out of a cast and ready to
play by the start of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern is acquiring a quality backup for goaltender
Martin Brodeur. Although the Devils have several solid young
goalies in the minors, Lamoriello said he wants a veteran ``who is
capable of playing 15-20 games and is willing to accept that
role.''

ANGELS CAUGHT JAY WALKING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ It went 9-1-5-4 in the scorebook, a double play that
was as costly to the Angels as it was strange.
</P>
<P>
   After the play, it took five minutes for the umpires to come up
with a ruling. And when they did, they took a run away from the
Angels. The Angels played the rest of the game under protest. But
by the time it was over, it might not have mattered.
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto Blue Jays scored two runs in the eighth inning and
two more in the ninth to open up a tight game on their way to a 9-4
victory Friday night before 36,052 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Because Texas also lost, the Angels still have a 1{-game lead in
the American League West.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays' Carlos Delgado hit two home runs and Jose Canseco
one off Angels starter Jeff Juden, making his home debut with the
Angels since being acquired in an Aug. 7 trade with the Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   Juden, however, had nothing to do with the play that had
everybody scratching their heads.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels lost at least one run and the chance for more in the
second inning on a play resulting from Garret Anderson's
base-running blunder.
</P>
<P>
   The game was tied 1-1 when, with the bases loaded and one out,
Gary DiSarcina hit a sinking liner to right field. It fell in front
of right fielder Shawn Green, and Jim Edmonds scored from third to
give the Angels a 2-1 lead. Or so it seemed.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was on second to begin the play and apparently thought
Green caught the ball on the fly. He didn't look at third base
coach Larry Bowa waving him over and stayed at second. Meanwhile,
Matt Walbeck went from first to second. But when he saw Anderson
standing there, he also assumed the ball was caught and ran back
toward first.
</P>
<P>
   While the Angels were confused on the base paths, Green got the
ball in to pitcher Chris Carpenter, who threw to Tony Fernandez for
the force on Anderson at third. Fernandez then threw to second
baseman Craig Grebeck to force Walbeck, who by this time was nearly
back at first base.
</P>
<P>
   Because the double play started with a force out, Edmonds' run
did not count. The Angels played the rest of the game under
protest.
</P>
<P>
   Juden looked overpowering at times, yet he got bombed enough to
put the Angels in a hole.
</P>
<P>
   He ended each of the first six innings with a strikeout, and had
nine in all. Three times he set down the Blue Jays in order.
</P>
<P>
   But in the second inning, Delgado hit a rocket over the
center-field fence. Then in the third, after an RBI single by
Green, Canseco hit a 422-foot homer to left-center for a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Velarde's two-run homer in the third cut the Angels'
deficit to 4-3, but Delgado hit his second homer of the game in the
sixth for a 5-3 Toronto lead.
</P>
<P>
   Juden left after seven innings, having allowed five runs but
only five hits.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays added two runs in the eighth inning on an RBI
single by Delgado and an RBI double by Jose Cruz Jr. In the ninth,
Green had an RBI triple and scored on a wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter (9-6) went seven innings to get the win, the second
over Juden and the Angels in less than a week. He beat Juden 6-4 on
Aug. 16 in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter, buoyed by the double play in the second inning, held
the Angels to three runs (two earned) and five hits.

   CLINTON-POLL _ President Clinton continues to draw high ratings
from the American public for his job performance, but his admission

   ATTACK-SUDAN (Khartoum, Sudan) _ Not quite 24 hours after U.S.
missiles hit a factory in a decrepit industrial area of this

RELIEF EFFORTS UNDER WAY FOR CHINA'S FLOOD VICTIMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to correct spelling of Sherilyn in graf 5.)  (lb) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL  
 &HT;     
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Even as battles against raging flood waters continue
in parts of China, relief workers have begun the herculean task of
providing food, water, health care and housing to the millions who
have been displaced by the floods.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, the government has had to evacuate 13.8
million people to keep them out of harm's way, sometimes with only
a few hours' notice; 5.8 million homes have been destroyed,
government officials said. And while the battle against new crests
and flood waters may be soon drawing to a close, the relief effort
_ which experts say will take months _ is only just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Chinese are now homeless, living on dikes or in
schools or factories that have been transformed into evacuation
centers. International aid workers say it will be months before
these people can return home or be moved into more suitable
housing. And in the meantime they are at high risk for infectious
diseases, from colds to cholera.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese leaders seem to be expecting a long haul, and on Friday
night President Jiang Zemin announced that he would postpone
important state visits to Japan and Russia that had been scheduled
for September.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese are excellent at what they do, but this is really
hard: There are so many in need and it's hard to get things out
into the field,'' said Sherilyn Amy, spokeswoman for the
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies,
which has been in Beijing for the last month to help oversee the
distribution of international aid. ``There is always flooding, but
other years were really incomparable to this.''
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, millions of soldiers and civilian volunteers have
been fighting raging rivers near the Yangtze and in the industrial
Northeast, working day and night, reinforcing old dikes and, where
those have broken, hastily building new ones.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a daily struggle to keep the water out of major
cities and away from important industrial sites, like the huge
Daqing oil field near the northeastern city of Harbin. The Nen
River has already submerged several thousand of the field's 20,000
oil wells, and others are at risk, according to Chinese reporters
in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Factories in Harbin have been working round the clock producing
sandbags to be stacked atop the levees to prevent water from
flowing over the top.
</P>
<P>
   The nightly news has featured endless images of this struggle
with soaked soldiers in chest-high water hauling sandbags to
reinforce the dikes. There has been far less coverage of the human
displacement, in part because the government has restricted access
to the more severely affected areas.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese Public Health Bureau and the vast Chinese Red Cross
have nearly doubled the number of public-health teams out in the
field, to 10,000, over the past four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how many people are living on dikes in China,
perched precariously on narrow man-made structures with water
lapping on both sides. But Ms. Amy, from the Federation of Red
Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said that 300,000 people were
living on dikes in the Dongting Lake area when she visited two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   She said that some had been stranded because they had no time to
evacuate, but that many others angrily defied orders so that they
could guard their property. The government intentionally blasted
dikes and flooded some villages in order to reduce water levels in
urban centers downstream.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Amy said some families had brought furniture, chickens, pigs
and even tractors. She added that the crowded living conditions,
poor sanitation and cohabitation of humans and animals made the
refugees vulnerable to disease. Many people are drinking river
water that is contaminated by human waste.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross is distributing vast supplies of
water-purification tablets, medicines and chlorine spray for
disinfecting sanitation pits and previously submerged land once the
waters recede.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Outbreaks of skin infections and infectious diarrhea have
already occurred, although more serious diseases like cholera and
typhoid that sometimes follow flooding have not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not heard of these _ yet,'' said Ms. Amy. ``And I'm
saying `yet' because there are so many people out there and the
high-risk period hasn't arrived.'' She said that such diseases tend
to occur when the flooding stops and there is standing water that
allows for the breeding of germs.
</P>
<P>
   There have been emotional benefit shows on television in Beijing
the last two nights, featuring a mix of popular performers and
representatives of companies, schools and local Communist Party
cells announcing donations in cash or in kind. The Beijing Public
Security Bureau pledged $40,000. Mrs. Xue Wen and her 17 children,
grandchildren and great-grandchildren pledged $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   But there are rumblings that government policy, as well as the
rains, is to blame for the current catastrophe. An article this
week in a popular newspaper, Southern Weekend, blamed poor dike
upkeep and clear cutting of trees as factors.

MIGHTY MAC HAS BASEBALL WORLD ON EDGE OF SEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Some of us are still waiting for the home run Mark
McGwire blasted at the Kingdome last season to touch down.
</P>
<P>
   Earth to McGwire's prodigious longball: Please phone home.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, those of us lucky enough to see McGwire's epic moon
launch a year ago June 24, before he was traded to that other
league, were glad the Kingdome ceiling tiles already had fallen
down and been replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Surely McGwire's nuclear tater would have set off another epic
roof disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Even the ex-Mariner Randy Johnson, the pitcher who was tagged
for McGwire's last Kingdome homer (OK, it did land and the
eye-popping tale of the tape read 538 feet), jokingly wonders if
that home run ball isn't still orbiting somewhere in space.
</P>
<P>
   You get the point.
</P>
<P>
   Big Mac does not hit home runs. He ignites them.
</P>
<P>
   There's ``Rocket'' Roger Clemens and then there's ``Rocket
Fuel'' McGwire, which means that for the first time since George
Herman Ruth, there is a home run hitter who is unafraid to call
himself a home run hitter and unabashed about making a national
headline circus of his longball feats.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there is Sammy Sosa, who tagged No. 49 Friday to help the
Cubs beat the Giants. Sosa has done the right things to amend his
mechanics, curb his impulsiveness at the plate. He has turned his
talent into big numbers.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, there was Ken Griffey Jr., who leads the American
League with 42 homers but who has all but defected from the Maris
chase. We dearly miss Griffey's participation in this
great-for-baseball home run drama, but the show must go on,
especially since Griffey will define himself as he sees fit _ which
means as one of the best, if not the best, all-around baseball
players ever to play the game.
</P>
<P>
   As for the New Age Sultan of Swat?
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has earned himself the title, and he's not even done
yet.
</P>
<P>
   While the world talks about how the chase is on to break Roger
Maris' single-season home run record of 61 in '61, it is McGwire
(and his Popeye-armed physique) who makes us crack open Baseball
Encyclopedias and click on baseball history web sites to help us
better compare him to the real Bronx Bomber _ Babe Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   It is the affable, generous and focused McGwire who makes us
yearn to get a historic handle on why it is we have come to accept
_ or rather, why we have come to relish _ the idea that he can
break this most hallowed sports record.
</P>
<P>
   That's because McGwire is assaulting the home run record in a
fashion befitting the Babe.
</P>
<P>
   That became especially true after McGwire hit No. 50 Thursday at
Shea Stadium to become the only player to have 50 or more homers in
three consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   To get some perspective on this feat, figure that even Hank
Aaron, who owns the career home run record, never hit more than 47
in a single season. Harmon Killebrew and Frank Robinson each got to
49.
</P>
<P>
   Also, with No. 51 in the second game of Thursday's doubleheader
against the Mets, McGwire tied Ruth's mark of 161 homers over a
three-year period, which Ruth did from 1926-28, including his
60-homer season in '27.
</P>
<P>
   Taking nothing away from Maris, whose record 61 homers is
magnificent if only because he achieved it under such agonizing
conditions in '61 _ with his hair falling out and the media
scrutiny intense _ the reason McGwire is readily able to win over
well-wishers is because the drama of his ear-splitting homers is
eclipsed as much by the pace at which he amassing them.
</P>
<P>
   Does anyone yet doubt that McGwire is heading as much for 70
homers this season as he is chasing Maris and 61?
</P>
<P>
   McGwire may hardly be ``Ruthian'' in regard to his place in
baseball history _ so far as we can now tell. No one compares to
Ruth, who started off as an overwhelming pitcher for the Red Sox
and ended his sport-defining career as a outfielder, just because
the Yankees knew they must take advantage of his awesome and
unfailingly consistent production and power at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   However, McGwire does produce his home runs in a fashion so
monstrous, so compelling and under circumstances no less difficult
than Ruth, there is now a new term in baseball:
</P>
<P>
   ``McGwire-esque.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Associated Press reports out of New York
described McGwire's gravity-resistant home runs with this term.
</P>
<P>
   Now, you cannot look up ``McGwire-esque'' in the dictionary. But
if you could, the definition most likely would be ``to crush'' or
``to captivate an entire ballyard, city, state and nation during
each drippingly anticipated at-bat.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has been ``McGwire-esque'' at the very least since last
June, when he showed the Griffey-watchers in the Kingdome the
difference between a perfect swing (Griffey's) and the epic swing
of a launcher of longballs.
</P>
<P>
   The race for 61 is not on, it's a done deal. And the man leading
the way has the colossus of clout-type of size and power to force a
nation to turn its eyes to him.
</P>
<P>
   To be ``Ruthian'' may be eternal, but we'll take
``McGwire-esque.'' Every day from now until October, with delight.

MOON, SEAHAWKS OUT TO IMPRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ All eyes will be on Warren Moon Saturday night
when the Seahawks take what could be the final giant step toward
their Sept. 6 regular-season opener in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks' starting quarterback will make his summer debut
against the Arizona Cardinals at Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe. Moon
missed basically all of training camp and the first three preseason
games because of his 25-day holdout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warren has picked up right where he left off at our minicamps
this spring. There aren't many quarterbacks playing right now who
can throw it better than he can,'' coach Dennis Erickson said
Friday after the team did a 30-minute walk-through before their
flight to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he needs to do it in a game situation,'' Erickson said.``
It's important that he plays quite a bit in this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon is scheduled to play most of the first half against the
Cardinals. His efforts, as well as those of the other starters,
will determine how much the No. 1 offense and defense play in next
week's rematch against the San Francisco 49ers in the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson would like to go with his starters for only a few
series in that game, but if they do not show a marked improvement
from last week's flat effort against the 49ers in Vancouver, B.C.,
they will play longer. Erickson has told the players what is riding
on Saturday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to sit down and look at where we're at
after this game,'' Erickson said. ``If we're not where we need to
be, we've going to have to do something about it against San
Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   So more than Moon playing like the quarterback who set club
records for completions and passing yards last year, the coaches
need to see improvement from all the starters.
</P>
<P>
   On offense, the runs Ricky Watters has come close to breaking in
the first three games need to go for double-digit yardage; the
early inclusion of Joey Galloway in the passing game that finally
happened last week must continue, but not at the exclusion of
getting the ball into the hands of Mike Pritchard, James McKnight
and Brian Blades; and the line must dominate as it did two weeks
ago against Indianapolis, rather than be pushed around as it was
against the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to see a little better consistency, the type of
consistency we're going to need opening day,'' offensive
coordinator Bob Bratkowski said. ``That's consistency in the
running game, pass protection and everything else. We've done some
good things. Now we have to do them consistently.''
</P>
<P>
   While this is a time for the starters to show that last week was
a one-game letdown, look for a couple of rookies to get some time
with the No. 1 unit _ third-round draft choice Ahman Green spelling
Watters, sooner; and second-round pick Todd Weiner replacing Howard
Ballard at right tackle, later.
</P>
<P>
   On defense, consistency also has been the buzz word this week.
In the first two preseason games, the Seahawks started slowly, then
put the clamps on Dallas and Indianapolis. Last week, the defense
produced its first three-and-out series to start a game, but then
yielded 70- and 62-yard scoring drives to the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just need to let it loose, play together and minimize the
mental mistakes,'' defensive coordinator Greg McMackin said.
``We're looking to do the little things that will allow us to play
with more consistency. That's what it all comes down to _
consistency.''
</P>
<P>
   As on offense, key backups like middle linebacker DeShone Myles,
this year's fourth-round draft choice, and cornerback Fred Thomas
will be worked into the mix with the No. 1 defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big game as far as evaluating where we're at _
individually and as units,'' Erickson said. ``That overrides the
winning and losing of this preseason game.''
</P>
<P>
   HAWK TALK: DE Phillip Daniels and DT Dan Saleauma will start
despite being slowed by injuries this week, Erickson said. . . . SS
Mark Collins is questionable with a sore hamstring, and whether
Blades' sprained ankle will allow him to play won't be determined
until the pre-game warmups. . . . DT Cortez Kennedy, who sprained
his right ankle last week, did not make the trip. He remained
behind to rehab his ankle. . . . For the fourth straight week, the
Seahawks are playing an opponent they will face later. They opened
at Dallas, and will play the Cowboys again Nov. 22. Next was
Indianapolis, and the Colts return to the Kingdome on Dec. 20. Last
week, the Seahawks played the 49ers and the teams meet again next
week. As for the Cardinals, they play at the Kingdome on Sept. 13.

WILLIAM K. MCWILLIAMS JR., 75, LEADER IN GAS AND OIL BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La.)  (lh) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   William K. McWilliams Jr., a geologist and leader in the oil and
gas industry, died of kidney failure at St. Tammany Hospital in
Covington, La., July 17, said William Collier, a spokesman for
Freeport-McMoran Inc. He was 75 and lived in Covington.
</P>
<P>
   McWilliams was an independent oil and gas producer, co-founder
and chairman-emeritus of the McMoran Oil and Gas Company and
director emeritus of Freeport-McMoran Inc.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, James R. Moffett, chairman and chief executive
of Freeport-McMoran Copper and Gold Inc., renamed from
Freeport-McMoran Inc., said: ``Ken McWilliams was one of the
foremost visionary geologists in the world. His geological
philosophy set the pattern that led to the company's ability to
find many world-class natural resource deposits.''
</P>
<P>
   McWilliams attended Tulane University on the first basketball
scholarship ever awarded by the school, and graduated with a
Bachelor of Science degree in geology.
</P>
<P>
   He maintained a lifelong interest in athletics. From 1982 until
1984 he served as chairman of the Louisiana Superdome Commission.
And in 1982, he served as chairman of the National Collegiate
Athletic Association basketball finals, bringing that event to New
Orleans for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, McWilliams was appointed by President Jimmy Carter to
be a member of the National Petroleum Council. He was reappointed
three years later by President Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife, Elleonora Perrilliat McWilliams, of
Covington; three sons, David K. of Covington and Paul C. and
Patrick T. of Metairie, La.; three daughters, Penny M. Doster of
Madisonville, La., and Jennifer M. Cantrelle and Rebecca M. Giveans
of Mandeville, La.; 11 grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.

BLUE JAYS BEAT ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
adds quotes, details 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It went 9-1-5-4 in the scorebook, a double
play that was as costly to the Angels as it was strange.
</P>
<P>
   After the play, it took five minutes for the umpires to come up
with a ruling. And when they did, they took a run away from the
Angels. The Angels played the rest of the game under protest. But
by the time it was over, it might not have mattered.
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto Blue Jays scored two runs in the eighth inning and
two more in the ninth to open up a tight game on their way to a 9-4
victory Friday night before 36,052 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Because Texas also lost, the Angels still have a 1{-game lead in
the American League West.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays' Carlos Delgado hit two home runs and Jose Canseco
one off Angels starter Jeff Juden, making his home debut with the
Angels since being acquired in an Aug. 7 trade with the Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   Juden, however, had nothing to do with the play that had
everybody scratching their heads.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels lost at least one run and the chance for more in the
second inning on a play resulting from Garret Anderson's
base-running blunder.
</P>
<P>
   The game was tied 1-1 when, with the bases loaded and one out,
Gary DiSarcina hit a sinking liner to right field. It fell in front
of right fielder Shawn Green, and Jim Edmonds scored from third to
give the Angels a 2-1 lead. Or so it seemed.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was on second to begin the play and apparently thought
Green caught the ball on the fly. He didn't look at third base
coach Larry Bowa waving him over and stayed at second. Meanwhile,
Matt Walbeck went from first to second. But when he saw Anderson
standing there, he also assumed the ball was caught and ran back
toward first.
</P>
<P>
   While the Angels were confused on the base paths, Green got the
ball in to pitcher Chris Carpenter, who threw to Tony Fernandez for
the force on Anderson at third. Fernandez then threw to second
baseman Craig Grebeck to force Walbeck, who by this time was nearly
back at first base.
</P>
<P>
   Because the double play started with a force out, Edmonds' run
did not count. The Angels played the rest of the game under
protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``My take was that Walbeck touched second, so I think that takes
the force off,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said. ``(Crew chief
Larry Barnett) said it doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he doesn't think the chances are good the league
will rule in favor of the protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably zero,'' Collins said. ``Anybody ever won one? I've
never heard of one being won.''
</P>
<P>
   While Collins said he'd never seen a play like that before,
Anderson said: ``It wasn't strange, I just messed it up. No
excuses, no reason to speculate. I take responsibility for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Juden looked overpowering at times, yet he got bombed enough to
put the Angels in a hole.
</P>
<P>
   He ended each of the first six innings with a strikeout, and had
nine in all. Three times he set down the Blue Jays in order.
</P>
<P>
   But in the second inning, Delgado hit a rocket over the
center-field fence. Then in the third, after an RBI single by
Green, Canseco hit a 422-foot homer to left-center for a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good,'' said Juden, 0-2 with the Angels and 7-13
overall. ``But I made a couple mistakes, left a couple pitches to
Delgado out over the dish.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Velarde's two-run homer in the third cut the Angels'
deficit to 4-3, but Delgado hit his second homer of the game in the
sixth for a 5-3 Toronto lead.
</P>
<P>
   Juden left after seven innings, having allowed five runs but
only five hits.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays added two runs in the eighth inning on an RBI
single by Delgado and an RBI double by Jose Cruz Jr. In the ninth,
Green had an RBI triple and scored on a wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter (9-6) went seven innings to get the win, the second
over Juden and the Angels in less than a week. He beat Juden 6-4 on
Aug. 16 in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter, buoyed by the double play in the second inning, held
the Angels to three runs (two earned) and five hits.

MARINERS WIN ONE-RUN GAME FOR A CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It took them nearly two months, but the Mariners won
another one-run game Friday night. They would have accepted any
margin of victory.
</P>
<P>
   Closer Mike Timlin battled through the most dangerous part of
the Chicago White Sox lineup to secure his 11th save in the
Mariners' 5-4 victory before 34,421 fans at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Joey Cora collected his 1,000th major-league hit,
Jay Buhner and Edgar Martinez hit home runs and Russ Davis excelled
in the field and at home plate.
</P>
<P>
   The M's hadn't won a one-run game since June 24 and are still a
major-league worst 5-20 in games decided by the slimmest margin.
They also had lost seven of their past nine games to fall 12 games
behind the American League West-leading Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to win a one-run game, but any kind of win is
nice,'' shortstop Alex Rodriguez said. ``You can't go out and score
seven or eight runs every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to right-handed relievers Jose Paniagua and Timlin, five
were enough in the four-game series opener. But it wasn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   Paniagua, promoted from Class AAA Tacoma on Wednesday, replaced
starter Jeff Fassero in the eighth inning. He ran into trouble but
escaped by striking out Ray Durham with two runners on base.
</P>
<P>
   He became the pitcher of record in the bottom of the inning when
Buhner worked losing pitcher Keith Foulke for a full-count walk.
Davis also went to a full count before slapping an opposite-field
fly ball to right field.
</P>
<P>
   Sox right fielder Magglio Ordonez, not nearly as familiar with
the wall as Buhner, positioned himself at the base of the barrier.
Bad move.
</P>
<P>
   The ball caromed toward the infield, giving Buhner time to score
the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a good at-bat,'' said manager Lou Piniella of Davis,
who fouled off two full-count pitches before driving in his 72nd
run of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella then turned over the game to Timlin.
</P>
<P>
   White Sox rookie shortstop Mike Caruso greeted Timlin with a
single, sending up Frank Thomas, Albert Belle and Robin Ventura, a
productive threesome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no fun facing those guys,'' Timlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas lined out to left fielder Rich Amaral. Belle, 3-for-3 at
the time with a home run and double, lined out even harder to
Amaral, who snagged the sinking liner at his shoe tops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw both of them (Thomas and Belle) sinkers,'' Timlin
said. ``With the ball going down, and them trying to lift it, you
get a lot of top spin on the ball and that's what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richie made a nice play (on Belle) and I asked him if his hand
hurt. He said it didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Still one out away, Timlin said he worked Ventura on the outside
and ``then tried to trick him by coming inside. I was trying to get
a slider down and in and he raked it.''
</P>
<P>
   The ball glanced off first baseman David Segui's glove, putting
the tying run on third base. But the game ended when Ordonez popped
out to Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Davis saved a run with a diving catch and throw to nail Durham
at first base and end the sixth inning. Amaral robbed Thomas of a
hit in the third with a lunging catch while running to the
left-field line and Cora snagged a Robert Machado line drive in the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero, who hasn't won since July 25 and remains stuck on 10
wins, yielded two runs in the first inning. Belle drove in one with
a single and Ventura doubled home the other.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner pulled the Mariners even in the fourth with his 13th
homer of the season. Cora capped the three-run inning with a
bases-loaded infield single for hit No. 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   But Fassero couldn't hold that lead, or the one-run cushion
Martinez provided in the fifth with his 23rd homer.
</P>
<P>
   It came down to the bullpens and Seattle's won for a change.
</P>
<P>
   Paniagua, working for the third straight game, has been
impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I see is a good, live arm,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played with him in Montreal and he throws strikes,'' added
Segui.
</P>
<P>
   Paniagua, claimed on waivers from the expansion Tampa Bay Devil
Rays during spring training, won his first major-league game since
Sept. 12, 1997 when he was pitching for the Expos and defeated the
New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told you we were going to pitch him to see what he can do
and we have,'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   Durham, who went 9-for-13 during a three-game series against the
Mariners last weekend at Comiskey Park, greeted Fassero with a
game-opening single to trigger the two-run Chicago first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, the Mariner third baseman, lent a helping hand, bobbling
Caruso's grounder, putting runners on first and second with none
out. After Thomas flied to left field, Belle smacked a drive off
the wall in left, scoring Durham. Belle, attempting to stretch a
single into a double, was thrown out at second.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura delivered a run-scoring double to left before Fassero
wiggled out of trouble.

</P>
<P>
   NIGERIA-BREAKDOWN (Lagos, Nigeria) _ Nigeria, Africa's most
populous nation, is rich. It has vast reserves of oil and minerals,
fertile land, more than 30 universities and many talented, highly
educated people. But after decades of gross mismanagement under
military rulers, it is also marked by sweeping poverty and ethnic
tensions. By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-ECON (Kaluga, Russia) _ For most people in Kaluga, last
week was just another chapter in a crisis that dates from 1991, to
the collapse of communism and of a way of life that was, if nothing
else, secure. Since then, they have lived through worse: the
soaring inflation of the early 1990s utterly wiped out people's
Soviet-era savings. This time, their savings accounts have remained
secure _ at least for now. What has made the week's events so
painful, and so bitter, was the reminder that the seven-year crisis
is not over, not by a long shot. By Celestine Bohlen.
</P>
<P>
   SWEDEN-PALME (Stockholm, Sweden) _ The site is so modestly
marked that it is easy to miss. Perhaps appropriately, one must bow
one's head to see it. The simple brass plaque in the pavement at
the Tunnelgatan entrance to the Hotorget subway station reads, ``On
this spot Sweden's Prime Minister Olof Palme was killed.'' People
by the scores find it daily, though, drawn to the site where many
Swedes think their country began to lose its way. By Warren Hoge.

American law-enforcement officials regard Charles Miller as one of

CLINTON SWEARS TO USE `ALL TOOLS' AGAINST TERRORISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton vowed Saturday that the United
States would use ``all the tools at our disposal'' to fight the
terrorist network of Osama bin Laden, as the administration
outlined efforts to squeeze him financially following the U.S.
cruise-missile strikes Thursday in Afghanistan and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our efforts against terrorism cannot and will not end with
this strike,'' Clinton declared in his weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
   As he vacationed with his family in Martha's Vineyard, Clinton
announced that he had signed an executive order, effective a day
earlier, that asks the Treasury Department to block all financial
transactions by bin Laden and an array of terrorist groups
associated with him.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, a Saudi exile accused of underwriting attacks by
terrorist groups around the world, is believed to have an inherited
fortune exceeding $200 million, and it was not immediately clear
whether the administration's action would have a significant
impact.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said he did not expect that bin
Laden would have many assets that would fall under the scope of the
law. ``We would not expect this single step to cripple this network
any more than we would expect a single military action in
Afghanistan to cripple this network,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   In his address, Clinton said the United States would urge other
nations to block bin Laden's assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes money _ lots of it _ to build the network bin Laden
has,'' Clinton said. ``We'll do our best to see that he has less of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 48 hours after the United States attacked a
pharmaceutical factory in Sudan and a remote training camp in
Afghanistan, there were still conflicting reports Saturday about
the success of the strikes, which involved roughly 75 cruise
missiles fired from Navy warships and a submarine in the Red and
Arabian seas.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, cloudy weather obscured satellite photographs that
officials had hoped would show the extent of the damage at the
training camp in Afghanistan, which is actually a series of six
sites spread over a remote, mountainous terrain near the border
with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   In Pakistan, the chairman of a Kashmiri military group called
Harkat-ul-Mujahedeen said Thursday's strikes had damaged or
destroyed three camps, killing 21 people, Reuters reported from
Islamabad. Earlier, a spokesman for bin Laden said that 28 people
had been killed in the strike. The administration said it still did
not have an accurate assessment of the casualties or the damage in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Around the world, the fallout from the bombing continued. The
Arab League announced Saturday that it would hold a meeting in
Cairo on Monday to coordinate support for Sudan, which has called
on the U.N. Security Council to condemn the U.S. attack.
</P>
<P>
   In Khartoum, Sudan, another day of protests began on Saturday.
In Afghanistan, an Italian military officer working for the United
Nations died Saturday, a day after he was shot in the capital,
Kabul, though it was still not clear the shooting was related to
Thursday's strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Washington, lawmakers rallied around the president.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., expressed strong support for
Clinton's efforts. ``The president deserves our support for acting
swiftly and decisively,'' McCain said in the Republican Party's
weekly radio address. ``The military strikes he ordered against
targets in Afghanistan and Sudan were appropriate. America's armed
forces carried out their mission with skill and professionalism.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's senior national security advisers _ Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and Secretary of Defense William Cohen _
went to Capitol Hill to build support for the strikes. In a
classified briefing on Friday, they also laid out the evidence the
administration says links Bin Laden to terrorist attacks, including
the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Aug. 7,
which killed 263 people, including 12 Americans.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sen. Dan Coats, a Republican from Indiana who had sharply
questioned the timing of the strikes given the controversy over
Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky, emerged from Friday's
meeting softening his remarks. ``There does appear to be credible
evidence to suggest that targeting an Osama bin Laden terrorist
training site was necessary,'' Coats said.
</P>
<P>
   However, he went on to say that Clinton's behavior had made
skepticism about motives and timing of the missile strikes
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the president's private scandal that is leading to the
public's skepticism,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his radio address, Clinton thanked congressional leaders for
offering bipartisan support for the attacks. He said the United
States had ``compelling evidence'' that bin Laden's network ``was
poised to strike at us again _ and soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton emphasized that Islam and its adherents were not the
threat, trying to draw distinctions between the Islamic world in
general and what he called ``a callous, criminal organization.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hundreds of millions of Muslims all over the world _ including
millions right here in the United States _ oppose terrorism and
deplore the twisting of their religious teachings into
justification of inhumane, indeed, ungodly acts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he vowed to press the fight, Clinton, echoing similar
remarks by Albright and other aides, grimly suggested that
Thursday's strikes, however effective, were not likely to put an
end to bin Laden's self-proclaimed war on the United States and
U.S. interests. ``We should have realistic expectations about what
a single action can achieve,'' he said. ``And we must be prepared
for a long battle.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   For much of the summer, hundreds of searchers dressed in
camouflage and armed with tracking devices that detect the
slightest motion of warm-blooded bipeds have been scouring the
woods of North Carolina and the slick-rock canyons of Utah looking
for three of the United States' most-wanted fugitives.
</P>
<P>
   They have used helicopters, night-vision scopes, heat sensors,
motion detectors, smoke bombs, armored personnel carriers, small
planes and radios with encrypted transmissions _ all for naught.
</P>
<P>
   The technology may be James Bondian. But what the searchers
really need, says one frustrated sheriff, is a snitch and a good
bloodhound.
</P>
<P>
   The searches are among the biggest ever mounted, authorities
say, and they have relied heavily on technology and gadgetry that
make the manhunts in movies like ``Cool Hand Luke'' seem quaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``These motion detectors, they're largely worthless as near as I
can tell,'' said Sheriff Mike Lacy, of San Juan County, Utah, where
a dragnet has been used in an attempt to find two men suspected of
killing a police officer and wounding three others. ``You pick up
something and you can't tell if it's a cow or a deer or a dog or a
man.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, nearly 500 people were involved in the search for
Alan Pilon and Jason McVean, the fugitives who vanished into the
red rock country of the Southwest in late May. But the search party
dwindled to a few sheriff's officers and amateur bounty hunters who
keep bumping into the deputies.
</P>
<P>
   In the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina, an army of more
than 200 people were engaged at the height of the hunt for Eric
Rudolph, who has been charged with the death of a security guard in
the bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph, a white separatist, had disappeared into the woods
shortly after the bombing on Jan. 29. He is also wanted for
questioning about three bombings in Georgia, including one during
the 1996 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   As the North Carolina task force dwindled, that search became
entangled with freelance bounty hunters and volunteers _ notably
James ``Bo'' Gritz, the former Green Beret colonel who makes his
living selling survivalist gear and railing on his radio talk show
about millennial conspiracies. On Friday, even Gritz gave up and
ordered his troops to prepare to break up their paramilitary camp
near Andrews, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph is believed to be hiding in the Nantahala National
Forest, south of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. He has a
$1 million bounty on his head.
</P>
<P>
   Bloodhounds are still used. But heat has been a hindrance to the
dogs, particularly in the arid West. The hot weather _ in Utah,
temperatures have reached 106 degrees _ has also hobbled some of
the heat-seeking devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have people giving you tips, or you don't do
basic police work, it can get pretty tough to find a guy,'' said
Capt. Terry Blue of the Montgomery County sheriff's office in North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this summer, officers from Blue's small office nabbed a
fugitive who was wanted in the killings of two campers. The
suspect, James A. Finley Jr., had bragged to friends that he could
elude authorities as well as Rudolph. But after a six-day search,
he was caught by men on foot, with dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the search party had done their homework, reasoning
that Finley might return to an old hunting hideout he had used
before. They also had a tip from a person who reported him trying
to enter a cabin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came running right to where we were waiting,'' said Blue.
``But we had everybody helping us. You've got a little different
mind-set up there with Rudolph. A lot of people aren't so eager to
turn him in.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   T-shirts that say ``Run Rudolph Run'' have sold not far from the
search base for Rudolph.
</P>
<P>
   A 31-year-old carpenter with survivalist skills, Rudolph has
left money behind after stealing groceries, and is said to have a
polite demeanor _ endearing qualities to some in the Appalachians
who resent the show of force by state and federal law-enforcement
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph is a ninth-grade dropout who is on the FBI's 10
most-wanted list.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, the search has centered on a relatively small
30-square-mile area in the mountains. But it is a thicket of
rhododendrons and hardwood brush, with plenty of caves and hollows
in which to hide.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Utah search has centered on 5,600 square miles
of public land _ an area bigger than the state of Connecticut _
that contains part of the Navajo Indian Reservation, the canyons
around Lake Powell, the expanse of Monument Valley, the high
reaches of the Henry Mountains and two areas whose names say it
all: the Dark Canyon Primitive Area and the Grand Gulch Primitive
Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could go hide out there now and nobody could ever find me,''
said Lacy, whose office is leading the search. ``There's plenty of
water, and food and old mine shafts to hide in if you know what
you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the aid of the National Guard and the array of
technology, the Utah search is back to square one, with few
substantial leads, said the sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're down to trying to do the leg work and following up on
tips,'' Lacy said. ``One day we'll catch them, or find them dead.
Could be a long time, though.''

   LAGOS, Nigeria _ By night, many homes here have no electricity.
But by day, the street lights across the long bridge connecting
Lagos island with the Nigerian mainland are often on, mile after
mile of feeble glows in the sunlight. Someone, it seems, forgets to
turn off the switch.
</P>
<P>
   The National Electric Power Authority, or NEPA, has long been
derided, its acronym widely held to stand for ``Never Expect Power
Again.'' But the daytime illumination of sun-drenched streets
amounts to a new twist in the long tale of waste that has brought
Nigeria to its knees.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, is rich. It has vast
reserves of oil and minerals, fertile land, more than 30
universities and many talented, highly educated people. But after
decades of gross mismanagement under military rulers, it is also
marked by sweeping poverty and ethnic tensions.
</P>
<P>
   A senior officer, Lt. Gen. Jeremiah Useni, said recently that
military rule for 28 of the last 32 years had been necessary to
``put the house in order.'' But the country where one in six
Africans live has been reduced to mind-bending disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Wires that never deliver electricity dangle all over the place;
people in Lagos call them ``decoration.'' Unfinished construction
projects dot the landscape, whims of past dictators whose days in
power ended as they had begun _with sudden coups.
</P>
<P>
   Potholes big enough to swallow small cars multiply. Electrical
turbines, oil refineries and water installations collapse,
depriving people of light, gasoline and running water. Airlines
make official announcements that they will fly when they ``can find
some fuel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a land that lives in self-imposed poverty,'' said
Samuel Aiyeyimi, 60, a former worker for the Lagos port authority.
``If we had invested some of the billions of dollars from oil in
agriculture, then we would have provided work and food for the
millions of jobless. Instead, we import food and people are
hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many of Nigeria's problems, the failure to develop
agriculture _ which thrived until the 1960s and the move toward an
oil-dominated economy _ has an explanation that seems to reside in
the pockets of the powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar cane, for example, would thrive here, but its cultivation
would end the highly lucrative trade in smuggled sugar controlled
by a coterie of powerful business people. Similarly, repair of the
refineries would halt senior military officers' profits from
transactions in imported fuel, and the refurbishing of
petrochemical plants would shave the big profits on imported
fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
   Ismaila Gwarzo, security adviser to Gen. Sani Abacha, the
dictator who died unexpectedly in June, was arrested recently in
connection with the disappearance of $2.45 billion from the
Nigerian central bank. The arrest appeared to indicate a
determination to set new standards and recover some of the money
stolen by the Abacha government.
</P>
<P>
   With official theft on this scale, it is little wonder that the
state lacks funds to fix the lights. Or to build schools. Or to pay
a decent wage to customs officers, civil servants, police officers
and young soldiers, who with monthly salaries in the $40 range have
little incentive to work and overwhelming incentive to procure dash
_ the bribes that almost universally grease the wheels here.
</P>
<P>
   The ``What do you have for me today?'' greeting at military
roadblocks often comes close to armed robbery. At airports, the
small baskets intended to ferry objects like keys or coins or
wallets through metal-detector machines are instead proffered by
officials with a whispered ``Dash me something!'' In any event the
machines do not work.
</P>
<P>
   By Western standards the sums involved are usually small, but by
the same standards these practices are corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   The system in Nigeria, from top to bottom, has become based on
such behavior. Any right, even any notion, of redress or the rule
of law has disappeared through years of dictatorship. In their
place Nigeria has succumbed to an army-run system where any
contract requires a payoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our military leaders have been lifting oil and money for
years,'' said Bola Ige, a leader of the southwestern Yoruba, the
ethnic group of Moshood K.O. Abiola, the late opposition leader.
``They have shown no love of their country. Only love of their
pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from those pockets, and the American investment that has
continued to pour into the Nigerian oil industry, lie the tens of
millions of Nigerians with nothing. Nobody knows how many they are.
The last census has been kept secret because, in a country where
each ethnic group wants to appear more numerous than the others, it
may be explosive material.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing everyone knows is that poverty is spreading _
per-capita income is one-fourth of what it was in the 1980s _ and
the population growing so fast (close to 3.5 percent a year) that
Nigeria's population may rise to 280 million by 2025, from an
estimated 105 million today.
</P>
<P>
   The millions of young people without jobs try any means to get
by. They surge forth at any of the staggering ``go-slows'' _
bottlenecks _ in Nigerian cities, an army of desperate peddlers
darting through the black exhaust fumes and offering chewing gum,
wrenches, garden shears, coconuts, pipes, roasted corn, even copies
of The Economist.
</P>
<P>
   Do not ask how The Economist reached them. This is a country of
intellectual vibrancy where a dingy newspaper store in a rundown
provincial airport will offer copies of ``Middlemarch'' and ``Jude
the Obscure'' beside a bar enveloped in the stench of broken
toilets and adorned with snail kebabs so old they look like
sinister waxworks.
</P>
<P>
   Among the desperate is Dhadrack Adason, 29, who has never been
able to find a steady job and now drives an Okada. There was once
an efficient Nigerian airline called Okada. It is now bankrupt, but
the name has stuck for the countless drivers of motor-scooter taxis
who weave through the chaos of Lagos.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The view from the back seat of Adason's scooter is instructive:
He splashes through pools of filth, past mountains of garbage,
through the thick waft of sewage, into a pall of grit and dust. A
bent woman tries to clean a Lagos highway with a dustpan and brush,
an act akin to trying to clear the Sahara of sand with a beach
bucket.
</P>
<P>
   Adason pays $5 a day to rent the scooter. Working 10 to 12
hours, he may make $8. With the $3 in profit, he tries to maintain
his wife, Patience, and his year-old daughter, Blessed.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most of the drivers, he has a helmet _ an old police
model given to him by his brother, a policeman. He has no savings
but hopes that ``by the grace of God,'' he may one day buy his own
scooter.
</P>
<P>
   After a 40-minute drive, he reaches his home in the Ilasan
estate, a slum on the edge of Lagos. He has a single tiny room
decorated with a poster of Abiola, the opposition leader who died
in detention in July. ``Abiola lives on,'' it reads.
</P>
<P>
   Ilasan was begun years ago as an ambitious state project to
provide cheap housing. But the buildings were never finished, the
``contractor'' took his money without doing the work, and today
600,000 people live without water, electricity, roads or a sewage
system.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is Aiyeyimi, the former port authority worker. Like
many people in Ilasan, he once lived in Maroko, a poor area on the
edge of the up-market Victoria Island. Its real estate was coveted
by developers in league with the military.
</P>
<P>
   On July 14, 1990, bulldozers flanked by thousands of soldiers,
with air force planes sweeping overhead, appeared at Maroko and
leveled the place. Aiyeyimi's three houses, representing his life
savings, were flattened, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The soldiers came with coffins, not ambulances, and said if we
wanted to die, they were ready to bury us,'' he said. In all, about
300,000 people were evicted, turned out onto the streets with
nowhere to go and no compensation. Many were killed.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of protest, the military government said some of the
homeless would be rehoused at Ilasan, more than 10 miles from
Victoria Island. Aiyeyimi was awarded Apartment No. 4 in Block No.
309.
</P>
<P>
   But the apartment, supposedly on the second floor, did not
exist. ``It was empty air,'' Aiyeyimi said, pointing to the
still-unfinished structure. ``The government gave me a flat, but
the flat was emptiness.'' When he protested, the military
authorities said that if his new home was ``incomplete,'' it would
be finished within six months.
</P>
<P>
   No work was ever done, he said. So he eventually rented a room
in Ilasan. Describing himself as a ruined subsistence farmer, he
tries to cultivate beans and sugar cane on a small patch of land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our only sin was that we were in a disadvantaged position,''
he said. ``It was the oil boom. All the big military men, all the
number ones, had to have a building on Victoria Island. Space was
running out, and the people in Maroko were in the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Aiyeyimi continues to fight for the evicted. ``It is a matter of
right,'' he said, ``and without rights for all, Nigeria has no
future.'' A case brought by rights groups is still before the
courts, although many buildings have already gone up on what was
Maroko. Among them is the Nigerian headquarters of Mobil Oil.

IN THE `WAR OF THE FUTURE,' U.S. RAIDS WERE A SKIRMISH

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The barrage of missiles that fell on Afghanistan
and Sudan this week was a small battle in a war without a
foreseeable end, U.S. leaders are warning _ not the moral
equivalent of war, but war itself, similar in some ways to the long
twilight struggle against the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is, unfortunately, the war of the future,'' Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright said. ``The Osama bin Laden organization
has basically declared war on Americans and has made very clear
that these are all Americans, anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said: ``This is an
evil that is directed at the United States. It's going to
persist.'' And Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering said, ``We
are in this for the long haul.''
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate target of the U.S. missiles had a ready reply: the
real battle has not begun, bin Laden's spokesman told Al-Quds
al-Arabi, a London newspaper, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   As they brace for bin Laden's reply, U.S. military, intelligence
and diplomatic services are charting the contours of a new
battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   Their enemy is a man, not a state, backed by acolytes, not
armies. In this war, where high-tech weapons may prove less
effective than pickups packed with dynamite, bin Laden, the exiled
Saudi terrorist living in Afghanistan, represents something
different _ something that Milt Bearden, a former senior CIA
official, calls ``Terror Inc.''
</P>
<P>
   His organization, such as it is, is unlike any other. It has no
real headquarters and no fixed address to target. It is a coalition
of like-minded warriors living in exile from their homes in Egypt,
Sudan, Pakistan and other Islamic nations riven by religious and
political battles.
</P>
<P>
   The bin Laden organization is global and stateless, according to
U.S. intelligence analyses, more theological than political, driven
by a millennial vision of destroying the United States, driving all
Western influences from the Arab world, abolishing the boundaries
of Islamic nations and making them one, without borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a crusade he's on,'' said L. Paul Bremer, U.S.
ambassador at large for counterterrorism from 1986 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a quantum difference in the way bin Laden looks at
terror,'' he said. ``What we are seeing is a shift to terrorism on
a more theological basis, to groups that are not after precise
political goals. When you start to embrace goals as broad as bin
Laden's, you are no longer constrained by the number of casualties
you incur. You are now in a different game.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the older groups in this deadly contest _ the Palestine
Liberation Organization, even the government of Iran _ have moved
toward the mainstream in the last decade. State-sponsored terrorism
is on the decline; with the exception of Iran, none of the seven
nations on the State Department's terrorist list has been directly
linked to an attack on Americans in years.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence agencies now list only six major Islamic
groups beyond bin Laden's that are active and capable of terror
against Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Four of them _ Hezbollah, the Shiite group based in Lebanon; the
Palestinian groups known as Hamas and Islamic Jihad; and the Armed
Islamic Group of Algeria _ have not recently specifically attacked
Americans, although seven American citizens in Israel were killed
in bombings blamed on Hamas in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   About 3,000 Islamic militants worldwide stand under bin Laden's
banner, according to a forthcoming report to Congress by Kenneth
Katzman, the Congressional Research Service's leading expert on
terrorism.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Many are radical veterans of the Afghan war against Soviet
invaders, a struggle that lasted from 1979 to 1989 and took
hundreds of thousands of lives, and one in which the CIA poured $3
billion into battle.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels fought the Soviet Army in a real war, sheltered in
mountains and caves, and their battlements and bunkers have been
fortified by bin Laden. Their numbers alone make bin Laden's
organization by far the world's largest international terrorist
group.
</P>
<P>
   And if history is a guide, the United States will not fight this
war in the mountains of Afghanistan. The last two superpowers that
tried _ the British in the 19th century and the Soviets in the
1980s _ met bloody defeats.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviets tried to attack the Khost encampment, which was
built by the Afghan rebels, with Scud missiles and with special
forces commandos. They failed.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside bin Laden in Afghanistan stand leading members of the
other two groups _ the Islamic Group and Jihad, both based in Egypt
_ which are skilled in the art of political assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Their resumes include the murder of President Anwar el-Sadat of
Egypt in 1981 and the attempted murder in 1995 of his successor,
Hosni Mubarak, two of the foremost pro-American Arab leaders of the
last generation. These groups have killed 85 tourists in two
attacks in Cairo and Luxor in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to overstate the threat that international terrorism
poses for the United States. Taken together, the handful of
organizations capable of carrying out attacks against Americans
abroad like the bombings of the embassies in Africa this month have
a tiny fraction of the U.S. military's firepower.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, by some measures, is the toll terrorism has taken immense.
Since 1989, the beginning of the end of the Cold War, 98 Americans
have been killed in foreign terrorist attacks. By contrast, on
average, about 85 Americans are killed every year by lightning
bolts.
</P>
<P>
   Coldly stated, Americans are far more likely to be killed by a
bolt from the blue than by a foreign terrorist's bomb.
</P>
<P>
   But the intensity of the coming war of which U.S. leaders are
warning is not accurately measured by body counts. It is measured
by the perception that bin Laden and his followers will continue to
pose a nearly invisible, potentially murderous threat to U.S.
interests and installations everywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   This is why the oratory of U.S. leaders in the last 72 hours has
been the language of war, hammered in by repetition. ``This is
going to be a long-term battle against terrorists who have declared
war on the United States,'' Ms. Albright said. ``That is what Osama
bin Laden did. He basically made clear that all Americans and
American facilities were potential targets, and he used the word
`war.' ''
</P>
<P>
   One of her spokesmen, James Foley said: ``A new era, in effect,
is upon us. It's imperative that the American people understand and
prepare themselves for facing this kind of a threat into the 21st
century for as long as it's necessary to face the threat.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bremer, the nation's counterterrorism ambassador in the
1980s, said: ``There's no such thing as eliminating terror, any
more than eliminating crime. What we're in for, if we're serious
about it, is the kind of sustained effort it took during the Cold
War _ not months, not years, but decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time there is a major terrorist incident American
politicians are always standing with clenched jaws saying we're
serious now. Their attention span always lasts a few months.
Congress has second thoughts about the budget. And everything goes
slack again. It would be a welcome change if the administration can
orchestrate a concerted attack.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what the CIA, among other arms of the U.S. government,
has in mind.
</P>
<P>
   In this asymmetrical war, where a small band of suicidal bombers
can hit the United States harder than the U.S. military can hit
back, ``good intelligence is 80 percent of the battle,'' Bremer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Flush with success in identifying bin Laden as the likely author
of the embassy bombings in Africa, and armed with at least six
years of electronically gathered information and other secret
intelligence on bin Laden, Washington's former ally in the Afghan
war, the intelligence agency now has orders to play offense as well
as defense against the man the world sees as the archenemy of the
West.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a one-shot deal here,'' a senior intelligence
official said. This is ``a real war against terrorism,'' he
continued. And he warned, ``There is a high probability of
retaliation somewhere in this world.''

   NAIROBI, Kenya _ Certainly the images and the oratory last week
were those of a fast-spreading war.
</P>
<P>
   In the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea, Tomahawk cruise missiles
roared from the decks of U.S. warships, bound for targets in
Afghanistan and Sudan, where they smashed into what U.S. officials
describe as a terrorist training center and a chemical-weapons
plant.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, some of President Clinton's harshest
congressional critics put aside partisanship and saluted the
nation's scandal-burdened leader for responding to terrorism with
military strikes. Days before, in East Africa, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright had wandered the rubble of the bombed-out U.S.
Embassy in Kenya, comparing the scene here to her childhood
memories of the blitz in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like being in a war,'' she said after returning to
Washington from Africa to help plan the attacks on Afghanistan and
Sudan. ``I think we are embarked on a venture in which we have to
deal over the long run with what is the very serious threat to our
way of life.'' Clinton warned that the United States was facing ``a
long, ongoing struggle between freedom and fanaticism, between the
rule of law and terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Battle
</P>
<P>
   It was hardly the first blow in the struggle. The bombing of the
World Trade Center in New York in 1993 shocked Americans out of
feeling safe in their geographic isolation. And the U.S. military
had struck back before, at targets in Libya and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   But last week's attack was portrayed as more than just
retaliation; this was a pre-emptive strike against a continuing
threat. And, ominously, the speechmakers were saying not that an
enemy had been crushed, but that a battle had been joined.
</P>
<P>
   So is the United States prepared for the consequences of what it
now insists is a global war on terrorism? Experts in terrorism _
and more specifically, in the activities of Osama bin Laden, the
multimillionaire Saudi-born extremist believed responsible for the
embassy attacks this month in Kenya and Tanzania _ say that if the
Clinton administration is true to its word, Washington is embarked
on a decades-long battle in which Americans may find themselves
increasingly targeted on the streets of their own cities.
</P>
<P>
   It is a war, they say, in which the United States is confronted
by an enemy who is difficult to identify and harder to catch.

   ``I don't think the United States understands what it's in
for,'' said David M. Anderson, a senior lecturer at the School of
Oriental and African Studies in London, who has studied the Islamic
fundamentalist groups in East Africa that have been tied to bin
Laden. ``This will be a long, perhaps never-ending, attritional
war. Pandora's box has been opened, and it won't be closed again.''
</P>
<P>
   Terrorism experts wonder if the United States is ready to add
itself to a roster of nations, including Britain, Ireland and
Israel, that have curbed cherished civil rights in order to combat
terrorism waged on their own soil.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Irish government responded to a bombing in
Northern Ireland that killed 28 people by announcing ``draconian''
measures to deal with terrorism, including a proposal that would
make it easier to hold suspects without charging them with a crime.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the attacks on Afghanistan and Sudan, the Pentagon
refused to provide basic information about how the air strikes were
carried out _ a degree of official censorship by the military
rarely seen in Washington since World War II. Lawmakers have cited
the embassy bombings in calling for Clinton to revoke an executive
order that bans assassination as an instrument of foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks on Afghanistan and Sudan seem to reflect the move by
the Clinton administration away from what had been its preferred
course in dealing with international terrorists _ treating them as
criminals and bringing them to justice through the niceties of law
enforcement, trial by jury and diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Due process may now be a luxury. While bin Laden is not known to
face charges in any U.S. court, the United States was willing to
dispatch dozens of cruise missiles to Afghanistan to destroy his
training camps and to kill anyone unlucky enough to have been there
as they landed, including bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been and will be times when law enforcement and
diplomatic tools are simply not enough, when our very national
security is challenged,'' the president said last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration hopes that by retaliating for the
embassy bombings, bin Laden and his followers will think twice
before striking again against U.S. targets. It is a popular
strategy among many of the president's political foes. The attacks
in Afghanistan and Sudan drew widespread bipartisan praise on
Capitol Hill, where Clinton was otherwise under siege over his
acknowledgment of an improper relationship with a White House
intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to applaud the president,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah, who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee and who earlier
in the week had called the president a ``jerk'' over his handling
of the intern scandal. ``I want to give him credit for being
willing to take this action at this time.''

<P>
   Retaliation
</P>
<P>
   But while retaliation pays early political dividends and may
serve as a deterrent, history shows that one act of retaliation may
simply inspire another.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, the United States bombed Libya after terrorists linked
to the Libyan government killed an American soldier at a Berlin
discotheque. Two years later, a Pan Am jumbo jet blew up over
Scotland, an attack that killed 270 people and was blamed by the
Justice Department on two Libyan intelligence agents. And the 1993
bombing of the World Trade Center in New York demonstrated that
foreign terrorists had already arrived on U.S. shores.
</P>
<P>
   Albright warned last week of the consequences of a tougher line
in dealing with terrorists: ``What I think is very important for
the American people to understand is that there may in fact be
retaliatory actions. We are very concerned about this.'' Even
before the U.S. strikes, half a dozen U.S. embassies in Europe,
Africa and the Middle East had been effectively shut down after
warnings that they were next on the list of targets.
</P>
<P>
   Some sort of retaliation for last week's air strikes seems
inevitable, if only because bin Laden's Muslim extremist followers
are so numerous and far-flung _ from Pakistan to the Philippines,
from Sudan to Afghanistan _ and so eager to follow his edict to
make targets of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The loose nature of this network, though, presents problems for
Americans in thinking about how to confront it. Focusing just on
the leader, some experts argue, is not a promising strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bin Laden is a bogeyman,'' said Anderson, the African
specialist. ``He didn't build the bombs in East Africa. He didn't
plant them. He just paid for them. There are lots of other small
groups who would have been happy to take his money and carry this
out. I don't think the United States really understands the way the
activists among Islamic radicals have broken into very small
fragments. They are connected to each other, but only loosely.''
</P>
<P>
   So targeting them for retaliation, he said, is likely to be
difficult. For now, the United States is eager to paint bin Laden
as the chief architect of the bombings in East Africa _ ``perhaps
the pre-eminent organizer and financier of international terrorism
in the world today,'' as Clinton put it last week.
</P>
<P>
   But should bin Laden be captured or killed, there are other,
more shadowy extremists who appear likely to take his place in
their holy war against the United States. In a sense, bin Laden's
notoriety has made it easier for Washington to mount its global war
against terrorism. Without him, the United States might be left to
battle an enemy that is increasingly dangerous but without an
obvious face.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a Presidents' Day interview with C-Span in 1995,
Bill Clinton reflected with frustration on the spate of books and
biographies that were already presuming to chronicle a president
then barely two years in office, declaring: ``It's just crazy. I
mean, how can you possibly reflect on someone _ I mean, you know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't spend a lot of time reading them,'' Clinton continued
philosophically, ``just because I think that what I need to be
doing is, I need to focus on today and tomorrow. I can't do
anything about yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton has spent his whole life devouring biographies of
his predecessors, and he now has more yesterdays behind him in
office than he does tomorrows. After the most tumultuous week of
his presidency, capped by a dramatic strike on terrorist outposts
abroad, the question that haunts Clinton is how he will be judged
in light of the Monica Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   For a man who, friends say, values his legacy above all else,
Clinton has often seemed oddly heedless of the effect of the
actions that will ultimately compose it. At a minimum, it seems
safe to second the verdict of Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., who
said this week that ``Bill Clinton has probably assured himself to
be a controversial historic figure.''
</P>
<P>
   This week's events also showed once again how hard it is to
fathom an ultimate answer, for less than 72 hours after his
humbling public confessional of an inappropriate relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky, Clinton was back in harness, vowing ``a long, ongoing
struggle between freedom and fanaticism, between the rule of law
and terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Wayne, a presidential historian at Georgetown
University, said, ``To some extent, he tends to focus best and most
like a laser as president when he's right on the brink of failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost as if he becomes careless, and then uses that
great skill and intellect to pull himself in line,'' Wayne said.
``This is a president who is going to be remembered as much for the
survival as he will for the scandal. That's a testament to his
skill in using the presidency to his advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   For some time, Clinton has hoped that foreign policy, which
daunted him early in his first term, could help redeem him in his
second, in part because a president has more room to maneuver
unilaterally and greater likelihood of bipartisan support. The
president's hand in the fragile Ireland peace effort, the
stabilization of Bosnia and his promised campaign against
international terrorism may yet come to seem among the most
substantial parts of his legacy. Ronald Reagan rebounded from the
depths of the Iran-contra affair to the deeper rapprochement with
Mikhail Gorbachev that cemented the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took office six years ago with sweeping goals, many of
which, like overhauling the nation's health-care system, fell
victim to intense opposition and his own over-reaching. Others,
like reaching agreement to balance the federal budget and passing a
major restructuring of welfare, succeeded beyond his doubters'
imaginings as Clinton pursued a synthetic style of politics that
borrowed from and confounded both parties.
</P>
<P>
   But now Clinton is at another dispiriting crossroads, his
dwindling tenure perforce limiting his power, and most of his hopes
for this year _ tobacco and campaign finance legislation and a
national discourse on race _ glimmering ever more faintly while the
Lewinsky matter stays in the spotlight. His job approval ratings
remain high, but his party's political prospects are uncertain this
fall, let alone two years from now, when he hopes the election of
Vice President Al Gore to the presidency can assure continuance of
his policies.
</P>
<P>
   Just a year after the White House and Congress reached peace
over the budget, the two sides are again headed toward a showdown
over taxes and spending. The administration has already issued
seven veto threats against spending bills that Congress must take
up when it returns from recess, seeking to restore financing for
programs Clinton favors or to delete language that would impose
ideological conditions. But the president may be forced to
compromise to avoid the appearance of inaction.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, Clinton will be operating with a demoralized staff
and a Cabinet whose own credibility he compromised by allowing them
to embrace his denials in the Lewinsky matter. In recent months,
some of the president's senior aides have taken to playing a
mordant game among themselves: imagining how their own obituaries
will reflect their service to a politician scarred by the Lewinsky
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What his legacy will consist of will depend, of course, on
who's deciding,'' said Alan Brinkley, a professor of history at
Columbia University whose work Clinton admires. ``All of these
scandals and embarrassments will be part of any account of his
presidency, but so will the things he's done that have not been
affected by that, including perhaps his reorientation of the
Democratic Party, which for better or worse is a very important
part of his presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, historians and politicians suggest that although
it is too early to put Clinton's legacy in perspective, it will
almost certainly rest principally on things he has already done,
because his current problems can only compound his natural
lame-duck status. Although the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll
this week found that 65 percent of Americans still approved of
Clinton's job performance, 60 percent also believed the Lewinsky
matter would have a serious effect on his administration over the
next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be careful with the institution of the
presidency,'' Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., who has never
shied from speaking his mind about Clinton, said in an interview in
the current issue of Playboy magazine, reflecting on the state of
Kenneth Starr's investigation into the Lewinsky matter. ``A wounded
president cannot govern well. I think we are being much too casual
about this matter. Even though he's a lame-duck president,
popularity and prestige can make him a formidable negotiator. But
if he's diminished, he will not have the influence he needs with
Congress. Legislators won't be afraid of him, won't want to help
resolve a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's best hopes for domestic achievements late in this term
have been overhauling Social Security and Medicare, tough tasks
that his advisers hoped he might elevate above partisan rancor with
no more elections of his own to face, but that will be much more
difficult in the bitter fallout from the Lewinsky case.
Congressional leaders of both parties have never especially trusted
Clinton, and the Republicans are now actively hostile and the
Democrats feeling betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was inevitable, regardless of what he did,'' as the
first Democratic president to face the challenge of rebuilding a
splintered party in the late 20th century, ``he would have
trouble,'' said Professor Joel Silbey, a Cornell University
historian. ``He is, after all, the first Democrat to say, `We have
to find another way,' and that does not lead to a great deal of
happiness about him or a great deal of memorable achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why, especially after the Republicans took control of
Congress in 1994, Clinton chose to stake so much of his presidency
on moderating the extremes of Republican proposals, defending the
poll-tested ``common ground'' of middle-of-the-road programs to
protect the environment, expand access to health care and promote
``values,'' like endorsing school uniforms and curfews for
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   It was during the shutdown of government in a standoff on the
budget in late 1995 that Clinton began to gain the upper hand in
arguments with the Republicans, and also, as the nation has since
learned, that he began what he has acknowledged to be an
inappropriate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Clinton has acknowledged deceiving the nation about
that relationship, his ability to articulate what was supposed to
be the major rhetorical theme of his second term _ healing the
partisan and personal differences of national life _ seems
irretrievably undercut.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot _ we will not _ succumb to the dark impulses that
lurk in the far regions of the soul, everywhere,'' Clinton said in
one passage of his second inaugural address that was meant to
describe racial divisions but now rings with unintended overtones.
``We shall overcome them, and we shall replace them with the
generous spirit of a people who feel at home with one another.''
</P>
<P>
   No less a moral philosopher than Clinton's Machiavellian former
strategist, Dick Morris, who was forced to resign on the day of the
president's renomination in 1996 after his relationship with a
prostitute became public, wrote recently of Clinton: ``Perhaps his
political power will return. But his moral authority is gone
forever.''

OUT OF CONTROL: IS IT PITCHER'S MOTION, OR EMOTION? 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Photo of Mark Wohlers being sent to NYT photo clients.

<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. _ It was, until the seventh inning, an ordinary,
lackluster ball game in a minor league park.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of a few thousand, comfortable on a cool night and
used to poor play by the last-place hometown Richmond Braves, still
managed to sustain a low-level partisan buzz as the score remained
tight, cheering in surprise at a rally in the sixth, when the
Braves took a 4-1 lead over the Louisville Redbirds.
</P>
<P>
   But then Mark Wohlers came in to pitch the seventh for Richmond,
and the fans went all but silent.
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers, 28, has been a major league star since 1991 _ a relief
pitcher for Richmond's parent club, the Atlanta Braves, and among
the hardest throwers in the history of the game. Capable of
overpowering hitters with a 100-mile-an-hour fastball, he saved 97
games for Atlanta spanning 1995 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But earlier this year, Wohlers suddenly lost his ability to
throw strikes _ a shortcoming akin to a writer unable to use verbs
_ and as the summer has gone on and he has twice been demoted to
the minor leagues, his control has only become increasingly
erratic, his appearances sprinkled with pitches that bounce in
front of the plate or soar to the backstop. His struggle to reclaim
his gift, apparently buried beneath a welter of emotional and
psychological problems, has become a discomforting public drama,
silencing crowds and drawing hushed clucks of sympathy from
broadcasters, his malady all the more poignant for its fundamental
mystery. Frustrated and bewildered, Bobby Cox, the Atlanta Braves'
manager, has publicly worried that Wohlers' career might be over.
And Wohlers himself, asked before Wednesday night's game how this
had happened to him, shrugged and said, ``I wish I knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers' delivery has been picked apart by instructors; he has
spent time this summer virtually reimagining himself as a pitcher,
going through his motion without throwing the ball or climbing the
mound. His desperation, perhaps, has been compounded by guilt;
remarkably, he has pledged to pitch a year for next to nothing in
salary after his current multimillion-dollar contract runs out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd go to the ball park, throw, do what I needed to do in the
weight room, and then for the next 22 hours I'd be in my hotel
room, by myself, driving myself crazy,'' he said of his worst days.
``I was very lonely, and very scared.''
</P>
<P>
   The world of sports has known its share of baffling
psychological problems _ basketball players who suddenly can't
shoot free throws, or golfers who come down with the ``yips,'' the
inability to putt with a smooth stroke.
</P>
<P>
   But baseball, for some reason, is richer in these afflictions.
It was, after all, Yogi Berra who purportedly said, ``Ninety
percent of this game is half mental.'' It's as good an equation as
any for the connection between mind and body that it takes to play
the game.
</P>
<P>
   But each time a catcher or a pitcher battles mental blocks in
the major leagues _ and some have been defeated by them _ it
somehow feels new, because it never stops seeming strange and
sinister.
</P>
<P>
   And so in a year in which baseball, with its enthralling home
run-record chase and the runaway success of the Yankees, has
finally regained most of the enthusiasm of its fans after the 1994
players' strike, Wohlers is a reminder that high-level sport can be
as merciless as it can be elevating.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's International League (Class AAA) game offered
no answers and no relief. Wohlers retired the first Louisville
batter on a fly ball, but that was the last out he recorded. Two
walks, a wild pitch and a single produced two runs. He walked two
more to load the bases before Richmond Manager Max Venable took him
out. Wohlers threw 25 pitches, 6 for strikes. Baffled themselves,
the fans moved from cheers to boos as the inning went on. But when
Wohlers walked off the mound, they offered disheartened,
sympathetic applause.
</P>
<P>
   He is physically fit; his arm is fine. And though he has had
personal problems that have to be distracting _ his wife of six
years recently filed for divorce, and at the end of July his mother
had a heart attack _ by all accounts, he is throwing his lesser
pitches _ his slider and split-finger fastball _ just fine. It's
only when he throws his fastball, his bread and butter, that his
delivery runs afoul.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes his left shoulder pulls open instead of driving toward
the hitter, and pitches wind up in the dirt. Sometimes,
overcompensating for that, he rushes his shoulder forward and
flings the ball wild high. The mechanical problems with his
delivery have been easy enough to analyze; his mind is getting in
the way of correcting them.
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers never had pinpoint control. ``I don't know that there is
any explanation,'' said Wohlers, who has been watching film of his
better days to reinforce a positive self image. ``I know there are
things that I do with my slider and my split that are correct that
I don't do with my fastball. I fly open. I get to the point where I
am about to release the ball, and my whole upper body just jerks.''
</P>
<P>
   He is a classic closer, in the mold of Goose Gossage or Mitch
Williams, speedballers whose terrifying power seemed always on the
edge of riot, and who often brought their teams to the brink of
disaster before nailing down the final out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was never a Maddux or a Glavine,'' said Richmond pitching
coach Bill Fischer, referring to Atlanta's masterly control
pitchers, Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine. ``But I'll tell you this: He
was a lot better than what he is. He can't throw the damn ball over
the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Fischer would seem to be the right guy for Wohlers now; as a
major league pitcher for the Kansas City A's in 1962, he threw
841/3 consecutive innings without walking a batter, still the major
league record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitching is concentration, and you can't focus on the whole
strike zone, you focus on a spot,'' Fischer said. ``Where he's
focusing, I don't know. Sometimes he says he throws the ball and
doesn't even see the catcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher continued: ``This is a man who throws 96 or 98 miles per
hour, and he's been a closer, one of the best. So you can't just
throw him to the wolves. And everybody's pulling for the son of a
buck. It would be different if he were a jerk, but he's a good guy.
He's like a guy out in the ocean, going up and down, drowning, and
we've got the life jackets, but they're tied down and we can't get
them to him.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dale Murphy, an All-Star outfielder with the Braves in the 1970s
and 80s, began his career as a catcher but had to change his
position because his return tosses to the pitcher habitually ended
up in center field. Mackey Sasser, a catcher for the Mets, had a
mental block that kept him from promptly returning the ball to the
pitcher. Steve Sax, a second baseman with the Los Angeles Dodgers
and the Yankees, developed a midcareer tic that caused him to throw
wildly to first base.
</P>
<P>
   There is, too, a list of pitchers who have suddenly lost their
touch: Joe Cowley, Kevin Saucier, Randy Jones, and most famously,
Steve Blass, who won two complete games for the Pittsburgh Pirates
in the 1971 World Series, won 19 games in 1972, but could not find
the strike zone after that. He won only three more games in the
major leagues, and he was out of baseball at age 32. Earlier this
year, Blass, now a Pirates broadcaster, sent Wohlers an encouraging
letter, though the two have never spoken.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Wohlers, who has had the same erratic tendencies warming
up in the bullpen as he has had during games, Blass pitched fine in
practice; his troubles began when it counted. But then his loss of
control was total.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different from me in that he's thrown well from time to
time,'' Blass said. ``So I think if it's there every once in a
while, there's something that can be built on. But there's a lot of
anxiety. A lot.''
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Blass said, he has no better idea of what happened
to him. ``If you can tell him one thing, it's when you get on the
other side of this, and remain intact, whether you solve it or not,
you're strengthened. No one will ever be able to destroy you
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Strapping, young and wealthy _ he is being paid $4.1 million
this year and will receive $5.2 million next year _ Wohlers,
outwardly, seems the epitome of athletic stardom. His difficulties
underscore the meaning of a trite phrase like ``it could happen to
anyone.'' He was not eager to talk about himself, perhaps
understandably. But when he relented, in the cramped Richmond
locker room, he was articulate and candid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see things turning around,'' said Wohlers. ``I can go
out there and sometimes things are really good. And I really
believe I'm a mentally strong person. I can overcome a lot of
things.''
</P>
<P>
   He sounded as if he was trying to convince himself, especially
because he also acknowledged that for a long while he was in
denial, attributing his difficulties to inactivity. Wohlers pulled
a rib muscle in early May. When he returned from the injury, his
troubles began in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got into a mental funk, and my mechanics started
getting out of whack,'' he said. He found himself in an awkward
position for an athlete, having to analyze his performance, step by
step, to work back to a place where such analysis is not necessary
and instinct rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, if I walked a few guys, I would just go, `Oh man,
bad night, let me go home and wake up tomorrow and start again,'''
he said. ``Now I overanalyze: Why did this happen? . . . what was I
thinking?''
</P>
<P>
   After yielding a pivotal home run to Jim Leyritz of the Yankees
in the 1996 World Series, which spurred New York to the
championship, Wohlers pitched with reasonable effectiveness last
year.
</P>
<P>
   But his failure this year has been public and, for a
professional athlete, demeaning. Twice the Braves have sent him to
Richmond, but even here, out of the glare of the major leagues, his
work has made catchers stretch, batters skip rope and crowds
murmur.
</P>
<P>
   In 27 games with Atlanta this season, his ERA is 10.18. He has
walked 33 men in 201/3 innings and thrown 7 wild pitches. Bad
enough. But in nine games at Richmond before Wednesday night, the
numbers were worse: 18 walks in 8 innings, 8 wild pitches, an ERA
of 14.63.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amazing thing is that he hasn't hit anybody,'' Fischer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers is seeing a therapist, he said, to deal not only with
his pitching problems, but also with his personal ones.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was sleeping better than he was in June, when he
considered quitting the game. But even so, the extraordinary strain
on him remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to realize this is only a game, just a small section of
my life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that he is stricken with an enduring guilt, and he
has personally apologized to his manager and front-office
executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my contract expires and everything is fine and I'm
pitching at the top of my game again and being one of the more
dominant closers in the league,'' Wohlers said, ``I would like to
come back and play for the minimum wage for one year. Believe me,
nobody can say anything worse about me than what I'm saying to
myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm my own worst critic. I know I'm way too hard on
myself. I know I don't cut myself any slack. That's one of the
things I'm dealing with my therapist about. But the only way I'm
going to get where I want to be is go out and keep pitching. And I
know it means going out and embarrassing myself.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Braves placed Wohlers on the disabled list and
told him he would remain in Richmond. Required to list a medical
reason for his assignment to the disabled list, the Braves formally
entered this: inability to pitch.

<P>
   Not so long ago, armchair diplomats took comfort in their
mastery of heady terms like ``throw-weight'' and ``detente,'' and
tested their mettle parsing the differences between SALT talks and
START talks.
</P>
<P>
   But the end of the Cold War and the swift, furious opening of
financial markets in far-flung locales like Malaysia, Brazil and
the Czech Republic have changed all that. Now anyone interested in
world affairs has to contend with a new vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   As Russia's woes of the past week have illustrated, the new
buzzwords of international diplomacy are ``devaluation,''
``currency speculation'' and ``debt moratorium'' _ terminology just
as opaque and loaded with free-floating dread as anything in the
Cold War lexicon.
</P>
<P>
   By week's end, not only were Russian lawmakers calling for the
resignation of President Boris Yeltsin, but the world's financial
markets were being pummeled, largely because of fears set in motion
by the decision of Yeltsin's government to devalue the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   A devaluation typically occurs when a country suffering through
an economic downturn decides it's time to lower the value of its
currency in relation to another _ usually the dollar _ to give its
exporters more muscle in international trade. A country's exports
suddenly become cheaper overseas and, ideally, local cash registers
start ringing.
</P>
<P>
   Early last week, Russia decided to do just that, announcing that
it would let the value of its currency fall as low as 9.5 rubles to
the dollar from 6.5 rubles, effectively devaluing its currency by
34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Russia is not likely to get much of a boost from the
devaluation because the price of its most important export, oil,
has already plunged this year, as have prices for other basic
commodities the country exports.
</P>
<P>
   If Russia exported cars, CD players or personal computers,
devaluation might have helped undercut the prices of other
international competitors. But as any shopper knows, Russia makes
nothing that competes with brand names like Toyota, Sony and
Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   The flip side of devaluation is that it makes imports more
expensive. Since Russia imports quite a bit of food and other
staples, the average Russian is going to find it even harder to
make ends meet. And Russian financial institutions that owe
dollar-denominated loans are discovering that the cost of paying
off their debts will rise in direct proportion to the drop in the
ruble's value.
</P>
<P>
   Bad news all around. So, why did Russia devalue?
</P>
<P>
   ``They had no choice,'' said Nancy Kimelman, chief economist for
Thomson Financial Services in Boston. ``You have everyone and their
mother trading against the ruble, and if you don't want it to fall
below a certain level the government has to go in there and defend
it. And the government didn't have the cash to do that, because
Russia is basically bankrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   What Russia has learned, as have several Asian countries that
are now economic basket cases, is that inviting market forces into
your economy also invites the wolves. Traders who make their living
betting on the direction of currency prices smell blood when a
strong currency masks a weak economy. Russia, which had already
squandered International Monetary Fund aid bolstering the ruble,
opted out of the blood bath.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians know that if they defend the currency's value,
it's just going into the pocket of some currency trader,'' Ms.
Kimelman said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia also declared a debt moratorium last week, which amounts
to a 90-day breather on the repayment of $40 billion in foreign
loans and perhaps as much as $100 billion in ``hedges'' _ insurance
that traders and banks use to protect themselves from sudden
currency swings.
</P>
<P>
   Moratoriums typically give battered economies some wiggle room
by allowing lenders and borrowers to renegotiate loans. But the
tactic, which has had mixed results in countries like South Korea
and Indonesia over the last several months, does nothing to address
underlying economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Russia's moratorium was lauded by some analysts.
``I wouldn't have advised them to devalue,'' said Morris Goldstein,
a former IMF official and a senior fellow at the Institute for
International Economics in Washington. ``I think it would have been
smarter to restructure the debt first.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But everyone has to be treated fairly for such a restructuring
to work, and foreign investors, who have grown used to reaping fat
profits in Russia, went into a tizzy last week when they learned
that some of the debt would be repriced more favorably for domestic
investors than for foreign investors, according to Credit Suisse
First Boston. Foreign investors, threatening never to open their
wallets in Russia again, quickly slapped down that proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Private jets are now ferrying foreign lenders into Russia to
repackage the debt in a way that all sides can agree on, and a new
proposal is expected by Monday. But while the debt restructuring
may calm Russian markets, the devaluation genie that has been let
out of the bottle may produce even more turmoil in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, Russia carried more weight on the international
stage in the old world of detente than in the new world of
devaluation. It still sits atop a formidable nuclear stockpile, but
for all its military might the nation of 147 million people
currently lacks the economic heft of the temporarily declawed Asian
tigers. And in a world where vast sums of money zip across borders
with a few taps on a computer keyboard, the ruble is just a blip on
traders' screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate,'' Ms. Kimelman said. ``If Russia had the
wealth to support its geopolitical might, it would be a different
story. But they don't.''

<P>
   Never admit fault or apologize after a car accident, especially
if you caused it. That's the standard warning of a personal-injury
lawyer, but unnecessary advice for politicians. Most would rather
be flayed than express actual contrition for a mistake, especially
if they have to use those two unthinkable words, ``I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that a simple, direct apology is often the one thing
voters most want to hear, as polls showed many Americans were
telling President Clinton last week. Such words are simply
unutterable for most public figures, whose fear of weakness is
hard-wired into their souls.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's inability to use any form of the the word
``apologize'' last week in his speech to the United States about
his affair with Monica Lewinsky was the aspect of his remarks that
was most criticized the next day and placed him in the pantheon of
elected officials who couldn't quite say they were sorry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mistakes were made'' is the famous circumlocution, and a
marvel of compact indirection, used by President Reagan to explain
the arms-for-hostages deal.
</P>
<P>
   More common is the phrase ``If I've offended anyone, I'm
sorry,'' used by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato after he mocked Lance Ito,
the Japanese-American judge who presided in the O.J. Simpson case;
it was a conditional construction that conceded no real ground to
his accusers.
</P>
<P>
   A more elaborate variation came from Sen. Bob Packwood in his
reference to women who accused him of physical trespass: ``Am I
sorry? Of course _ if I did the things that they said I did.''
</P>
<P>
   If an apology is absolutely required, its power can be reduced
with explanations, excuses and the half-hearted stiffness of a
schoolboy summoned to the front of the room.
</P>
<P>
   When Kurt Waldheim, the president of Austria and a Nazi
intelligence officer during World War II, had to apologize on
behalf of his country for Nazi war crimes, he did it this way:
``Obviously there is no collective guilt. Nevertheless, as head of
state of the Republic of Austria, I wish to apologize for Nazi
crimes committed by Austrians.''
</P>
<P>
   Asian politicians appear to have a better understanding of the
cathartic value of complete repentance, although Japan has long
refused to apologize for its wartime atrocities in Korea and China.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is more than unbearable for me to face you and make this
confession of my shameful deeds, and I deeply apologize,'' said
former South Korean President Chun Doo-hwan in a 1988 admission of
abuse of power. ``The scar will be forever with me in my heart for
the people who have suffered, and for this I feel more regret than
I can express.'' Now that's remorse.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the United States, though, the most effusive apologies are
often those made by politicians for someone else's mistakes. ``I
apologize to the citizens of Crown Heights, to the Rosenbaum family
and to all of the people that were affected by this,'' New York
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said recently, referring to the way his
predecessor, David Dinkins, conducted himself during the 1991
disturbances in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   But after he criticized his electoral opponent, Ruth Messinger,
last year for failing to attend a Catholic Mass, he issued an
apology ``to anybody who feels they need an apology.''
</P>
<P>
   President George Bush was full-throated when righting a
historical wrong. ``The internment of Americans of Japanese
ancestry was a great injustice,'' he said, ``and it will never be
repeated.'' But he was a bit more pragmatic in wishing he had never
raised taxes: ``I did it and I regret it and I regret it. Any time
you get hammered on something, I guess you want to redo it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did express regret in his remarks last week, and said
his actions were wrong. In the taxonomy of political penitence,
that at least is a few degrees above the norm, as captured in this
classic 1987 statement from former New York Mayor Edward Koch,
referring to the president of one of the city's boroughs: ``If I've
insulted him in the past, then I'm sorry and I withdraw my remarks.
But I can't think of any.''

<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria _ In southern Nigeria, which is mainly Christian,
religious bumper stickers abound. ``Be a sweatless winner,'' says
one. ``Work with us at the Living Faith Church.'' Another advises
that ``Jesus Christ gives, heals and delivers.'' Or there is this
simple admonition: ``Be careful, God is watching.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhortations can be hard to read through the black exhaust
fumes that belch from Nigeria's crumbling fleet of vehicles, but
there is no mistaking the religious fervor that has gripped the
southern half of Africa's giant as misery has grown. In Lagos,
billboards advertising cut-rate Bibles hover over streets seething
with people fighting to survive.
</P>
<P>
   In the north, where Islam is dominant, religious belief is no
less fervent, but it takes another form. Ordered, hierarchical,
rigorous, fatalistic, the faith of the dominant Hausa and Fulani
ethnic groups provides the bedrock of a society still structured
around the authority of traditional Muslim rulers.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria's motto is simple: ``Unity and Faith.'' But there is so
little of the former and so much of the latter that the survival of
Africa's giant is no simple affair. As Nigeria moves toward a
treacherous democratic transition next year, after decades of
military rule, unity is as fragile as the religious faith is
diverse.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is faith, in the end, that may offer the nation its best
hope for unity. The simple habit _ and its extraordinary intensity
_ is something that almost every Nigerian believer seems to share.
</P>
<P>
   God, constantly invoked, works overtime in Nigeria. He alone,
for many people, can explain how an oil-rich country came to find
itself without gasoline; how more than $10 billion a year in oil
revenue can be stolen or squandered; how a longed-for democracy has
taken the form of a repetitive mirage. If there is a single refrain
from the suffering, it is ``What this country needs is a
God-fearing ruler.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if Nigeria finds one _ and Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar,
who took office in June, shows signs of more probity than his
predecessors _ the wounds are deep. Old fault lines _ ethnic,
cultural and social _ have been worsened by a spreading poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Having fallen apart once _ in 1967, when the southeastern Ibo
declared the state of Biafra _ Nigeria is haunted by fears of going
down Rwanda's path. Because of its weight in Africa _ in
population, resources, universities, military power or its vibrant
press _ such a road would be a cataclysm.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the fissures in this country, which was thrown together
on the whim of a British colonial governor in 1914, those based on
religion may be the most treacherous. But it is still not clear
whether religion will ultimately push Nigerians toward fracture or
reconcile them.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three main ethnic groups, the northern Hausas are Muslim,
the southeastern Ibos are overwhelmingly Christian and the
southwestern Yorubas mixed.
</P>
<P>
   But that is only part of the picture: There are more than 200
other groups of various religions; the relaxed, fluid Islam of many
Yorubas has nothing to do with that of the Hausas; paganism is
strong in some areas; thriving Baptist, Pentecostal, Catholic,
Seventh-Day Adventist and other churches compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Religion _ whether Christian, Muslim or pagan _ is a booming
business throughout Nigeria,'' said Onaolapo Soleye, a former
finance minister from the southwest. ``But in the north, religion
is different: more fatalistic and more all-encompassing. Everything
there is Allah's work. Well, we do not think it's Allah's work that
more and more people are poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments reflect a thinly veiled resentment in the south
over what is seen as the long domination by northern, devoutly
Muslim generals. The most reviled was Gen. Sani Abacha, the
dictator who died suddenly in June. There is a widespread
conviction in Lagos and other southern towns that a northern Islam
has held sway too long.
</P>
<P>
   Abacha's predecessor, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, enraged many
Christians with actions that included steering Nigeria into the
Organization of the Islamic Conference in 1986. In the early 1990s,
riots between Muslims and minority Christians in two northern towns
left more than 1,000 people dead. The army clamped down, but the
danger still lurks.
</P>
<P>
   Babangida, now in retirement, has abruptly become vociferous
about the need for compromise in the interests of Nigerian unity.
``When I decreed a two-party system for the 1993 election, everyone
said there would be a Muslim-Christian split,'' he said. ``Well,
they were wrong. There were Muslims and Christians in both parties.
Nobody wants to break this country into pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   The apparent winner of that election was Moshood K.O. Abiola, a
Muslim and a Yoruba from the south who attended a Baptist school
and won huge support in the Islamic north. His following did
suggest that the religious divisions could be overcome, but then
the army annulled the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola was jailed, and was still in detention when he died last
month. Now, with resentment about his loss running high, it will be
more difficult, perhaps impossible, to find a leader who can reach
across Nigeria's religious and regional divides.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But there are voices of reason, including the emir of Kano and
other prominent northerners who suggest it is time that a
southerner rule.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt in any part of the country that it was God's
intervention that saved Nigeria from Abacha. On that point, unity
is absolute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nigerians really do pray,'' said Bashir Ikara, a university
professor in the northern town of Kaduna. ``There may be a tug or
war between us, but we are united in our prayers. And tell me, what
does the average northern Nigerian really have to show for the long
domination of a small northern caste?''
</P>
<P>
   In a Lagos slum, Stephen Aiyeyimi, an unemployed university
graduate and an ardent Christian, expressed similar sentiments.
``Everyone in Nigeria is very close to God,'' he said. ``That is
because we have all been pushed to the wall, northerners and
southerners. We have been made poor, we have little money to meet
our needs, and so there is a tendency to want to depend on a
strange, unknowable force.''

MISSILE STRIKES SEEN AS DEPARTURE FOR ADMINISTRATION

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ American and Western officials describe the Clinton
administration's decision to use missile strikes to respond to the
embassy bombings in East Africa as a significant departure from its
past practice of seeking international support and U.N.
authorization for American military action.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, citing ``aggressive multilateralism,'' the Clinton
administration has waited for law enforcement authorities to come
to a conclusion or has sought the broadest possible international
support for its actions. It has preferred to use sanctions or to
secure a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the use of
force after presenting the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But with the long stalemate in the Middle East, the lack of
Saudi cooperation with the 1996 bombing of American troops at
Khobar Towers and the shift in Iraqi policy due to irresolution
from the Security Council, Clinton was less inclined to wait and
allow America ``to again appear weak or irresolute,'' a senior
American official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a departure,'' a senior State Department official
said. ``This is the beginning of a serious effort to go after
terrorists who threaten Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Several senior officials, all of whom spoke on the condition of
anonymity, defended the rapid use of military force against the
terrorism network of Osama bin Laden, citing several factors: the
ambivalence of Muslim allies, the United Nations' delay in dealing
with Iraq, and mounting evidence of plans for impending attacks on
more American embassies.
</P>
<P>
   Another official emphasized the importance of imminent threat
rather than retaliation. ``We're not in the tit-for-tat business,''
the official said. ``We're in the deterrence business.''
Deterrence, he suggested, is not built on overly legalistic
niceties or delay.
</P>
<P>
   A senior White House official said: ``The threat was credible
and imminent to American citizens. It was directed to us, not to
the U.N. To take other measures would have risked human lives.''
</P>
<P>
   American credibility in the Arab world had already suffered
because of Washington's failure to secure an interim settlement in
the Middle East peace negotiations. Arab countries are reluctant to
provide public support for American military operations like
Thursday's, even when aimed at bin Laden, who is working to
undermine the established Arab regimes.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Arab diplomats said that Arab ambassadors complained
Friday to the assistant secretary of state for Near East affairs,
Martin Indyk, that striking Sudan _ a member of the Arab League _
was a strategic error, and noted that even Egypt had chosen to keep
public silence about the strikes.
</P>
<P>
   But they did not make a point of defending bin Laden in private,
though their countries refused to support the missile strikes in
public, and the state-controlled newspapers in moderate Persian
Gulf allies like Qatar and Abu Dhabi sharply attacked the American
strikes as arrogant.
</P>
<P>
   Hala Maksoud, president of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination
Committee here, said the strikes ``reinforce the impression that
the U.S. is trigger-happy when it comes to the Arab world.'' While
Sudan and the Taliban _ the militant Islamic group that controls
most of Afghanistan _ are isolated among other Muslims, she said,
``because of the Israeli stalemate and frustration, the Arab world
ends up sympathizing with Sudan and Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impression is that the United States pre-empted the
results of its investigation, did not give Afghanistan a chance to
hand over bin Laden, did not go to the Security Council or show
evidence or rally world opinion or consult its allies, but just is
going it alone and undermining the international community and its
will.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, senior American officials say, there are indications
of significant progress in the last few days to conclude the
agreement between Israel and the Palestinians over a 13 percent
withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West Bank. Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is said to have agreed to the 13
percent the Americans have insisted upon, although 3 percent of it
is to involve a form of a now largely unpopulated ``nature
preserve,'' with restrictions over Palestinian rights to build
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The differences are narrowing and there are hopes that they
can be bridged,'' one official said, noting that American
negotiator Dennis Ross would go to Oslo this weekend for an event
at which senior Israeli and Palestinian negotiators will be
present. ``But by the time we have a deal,'' the official said,
``it won't mean very much, and the bounce will be zippo, and even
bitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Katzman, senior Middle East analyst at the Congressional
Research Service, said that Arab countries saw a parallel between
Saddam Hussein and bin Laden: ``The American willingness to strike
wantonly and cause collateral damage without taking the matter to
the Security Council, presenting evidence, and getting
authorization to strike.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans thought they would have more support given bin
Laden's threat to Arab regimes, Katzman said. ``But the Arab street
matters, and moderate Arab governments are afraid of inflaming bin
Laden supporters in their countries, and the numbers of those
supporters have increased. Egypt and the Saudis are nervous in part
because they don't want bin Laden to be made into a martyr, and
drive more young people into Islamic Jihad.''
</P>
<P>
   More young Arabs, Katzman said, sympathize with bin Laden's
desire ``to force the infidels out of the Muslim world,'' with
Israel and the United States being the main interlopers, now that
the Afghans have evicted the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kagan of the Carnegie Endowment applauded the missile
strikes. ``It is a departure for this administration, and it points
up their manifest failure to rally allies behind the American use
of force, especially when it comes to the Security Council,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, if you wound bin Laden, you've got to kill him,'' Kagan
added. ``We need to keep going after him and put him out of
business. But that's a real campaign, and it may entail more
serious foreign-policy challenges than bombing two primitive
non-states like Afghanistan and Sudan.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If diplomats are sent abroad to lie for their
countries, sometimes their greatest contribution to peace can be to
sell creative, convenient and competing fictions to both sides in a
civil war.
</P>
<P>
   As Chechnya went, so, perhaps, can go Kosovo. In both places the
ideals of absolute sovereignty and self-determination are bent
these days to make way for the notion that peace is more
complicated than either of those ideals permits.
</P>
<P>
   And not just in the lands of Eastern Europe. Something similar
is happening in far-flung corners of an ethnically divided world,
from Northern Ireland to Abkhazia to the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   It is Chechnya, the secessionist province of southern Russia,
that has begun to serve as a model, at least for Kosovo. A brutal
war was brought to a halt in 1996 when both sides agreed to
contradictory pretenses. The bargain kept Chechnya legally a
territory within Russia, but the Chechens were left to run it on
their own.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Chechens, who had fought for independence, can behave as
if that was what they won. And the Russians, whose army was
humiliated, can insist they remain sovereign over a territory they
do not control.
</P>
<P>
   In this fine area between what the diplomats call de facto and
de jure (loose translation: really and legally), negotiators found
something perhaps more valuable than literal truth _ a bit of room
to stop the slaughter and buy some time by putting off a final
determination of sovereignty. Temporary peace may not be divine
justice, but it may be more infectious.
</P>
<P>
   The hope, of course, is that in a few years the politicians who
began the ethnic wars will have passed from the scene, opening the
way for other, newer politicians more capable of negotiating a
peace based on realities rather than fictions.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomats are thinking along those lines when they try to
stop the killing in Kosovo, the southern Serb province. Ethnic
Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the population, are demanding
independence, but the Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic refuses to
grant more than limited autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   So negotiators are pressing for a Chechnya-like solution: full
autonomy that amounts to de facto independence for Kosovo, with
legal sovereignty remaining with Belgrade (so long as the Kosovars
agree to protect the rights of the minority Serbs and Serb holy
places). The Kosovars would maintain current borders and reject any
political association with Albania or other surrounding states. And
international observers would monitor the whole semantic fiction.
</P>
<P>
   After all, said Moises Naim, the editor of the journal Foreign
Policy, ``The gap between international law and realities on the
ground is growing by the day, and new forms of arrangements are
growing, too, especially where borders become much more open to
trade and investment than to tolerance and ideas.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A Trend
</P>
<P>
   In Northern Ireland and in the territories to which the
Palestinian Authority lays claim, as well as in the Abkhazia region
of Georgia and the Tatarstan republic of Russia, traditional ideas
of sovereignty are being subverted in the name of peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend may be hard to see because it is surrounded by
ethnic cleansing and conflict,'' said Naim. ``But pressures are
building for more flexible notions of sovereignty. While people
claim borders are sacred, reality makes them very porous and in
many dimensions, irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul R. Williams worked as a State Department lawyer and advised
the Bosnians at the Dayton talks, as he now advises on Kosovo.
``During the Cold War, everyone needed states with borders,'' he
said. ``It demarcated the chessboard.'' But a messier world
requires more imagination; in Kosovo's case, he suggests a form of
``phased independence or intermediate sovereignty,'' with
restrictions on its ability to associate with Albania, for
instance.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Goble, a former State Department and intelligence analyst
now at Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, said that before World War
II there were varying kinds of sovereignty in a world that was
beginning to move away from colonial rule, with numerous
protectorates and mandates.
</P>
<P>
   ``After World War II and during the Cold War, we decided to
treat all states as nation states, with equal status,'' he said.
``But the world is more complicated than that. With the end of the
ideological divisions that defined a lot of what we did at the
United Nations, we're more open to complications.''
</P>
<P>
   The Norm
</P>
<P>
   Border changes, which were unknown from 1945 to 1989, are the
historical norm in a Europe of nationalities, Goble said. ``What a
state can and cannot do, and its relationship to its own population
and the rest of the world, are now more open questions.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be particularly true in eastern and central Europe,
where questions of national identity and suppressed national
minorities kicked off World War I. Communist leaders _ like Stalin
and Tito _ tried to bury them under the repressive and false new
identity of ``socialist man.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the collapse of the Soviet Union and its empire _ in
considerable part because of the unsolved nationalities question _
successors like Milosevic have openly manipulated these tensions
for political support and reaped horrors like Bosnia, Chechnya and
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Chechens fought the Russians to a standstill,
Milosevic's army has been rolling up the insurgent militia, the
Kosovo Liberation Army, and has driven nearly a third of Kosovo's
population from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Serb depredations have made it impossible for the Kosovar
Albanians to agree on a negotiating position that would be accepted
by both the moderate leader Ibrahim Rugova and the shadowy fighters
of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Bosnia _ and like Chechnya _ the war is a civil one
within the internationally recognized boundaries of the former
Yugoslavia, making it much harder for the world to intervene. As
important, Washington and NATO do not favor the independence that
the Kosovars want, fearing that new borders will mean wider
conflicts in the region and even the destruction of the Bosnian
settlement, which set up a multiethnic state.
</P>
<P>
   So despite their horror at Milosevic's tactics and duplicity,
the West, thus far, favors an outcome closer to his position than
to the KLA's.
</P>
<P>
   And Milosevic's brutal and at least temporarily successful
campaign against the KLA, while NATO has watched, probably makes
the prospect of negotiating an extended form of autonomy for Kosovo
easier than before.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's beaten them back, and that changes things,'' said one
senior NATO-country diplomat. ``The West wants to avoid both
intervention and independence. So if Milosevic can handle it
himself, it makes it easier to negotiate the kind of intermediate
outcome we prefer.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When American voters entered into a liaison with
Bill Clinton in 1992, they had no idea how politically dangerous it
could be. In the primaries, Clinton swerved from the draft to
Gennifer Flowers to questions about the state of his marriage. In
the White House, the tumult only escalated, but the self-styled
``Comeback Kid'' managed to win re-election anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But even taking for granted a president who has made the
unpredictable predictable, Democrats and Republicans alike have
been knocked completely off balance by the Monica Lewinsky debacle.
Things are so unsettled that politicians in both parties last week
found themselves alternately condemning Clinton and offering solace
_ and keeping their mouths shut.
</P>
<P>
   While the uproar over sex at the White House appears to have
eclipsed the congressional elections that are only 72 days away, it
could have a tremendous influence on them, as well as on the battle
for the White House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first election in which the outcome _ that is,
control of the House _ could determine whether a presidential
impeachment process goes forward.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some unforeseen domestic crisis or war could render
the whole scandal moot. Who would have thought that Clinton's
dramatic admission last Monday that he had lied about his affair
with Ms. Lewinsky would be overtaken later in the week by
unparalleled, simultaneous cruise-missile strikes against terrorist
targets on two continents? Clinton, whether intentionally or not,
managed to change the subject, at least for now. Talk about an
August surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's madness to predict where we are at this point,'' said
Tony Dolan, a former speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan.
``You can't strategize about chaos. And we're just entering the
chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the speculation, no one has a clue about the true
repercussions of the scandal. It is the biggest unanswered _ and,
for now, unanswerable _ question in U.S. politics. Here, though,
are some possibilities:
</P>
<P>
   The `Voters Stay Home' Scenario
</P>
<P>
   The most popular scenario among Republicans is that as more and
more embarrassing revelations about Clinton pour out, they will
galvanize Republicans to vote against Democrats _ and Democrats
will grow so irate that they stay home. The result would be that
the Republicans not only keep control of the House and Senate but
also pick up some seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``When things happen that make one side's partisans unhappy,
they stay home,'' Gingrich told a crowd of young Republicans in
Atlanta last week. ``When they stay home, they stay home for the
whole ticket. I believe this fall we're going to see a surprisingly
big Republican victory almost everywhere in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Barely three months ago, Gingrich counseled Republicans to
attack Clinton on his personal ethics. But last week, he was mum.
The last thing he wants is his mug featured in Democratic
commercials as the bogeyman who is out to do in Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to give Clinton the life preserver that he
would like: to make this a partisan attack,'' said a leading
Republican strategist, who was so reluctant to appear out to get
Clinton that he spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans are less timid. In Tennessee, Dan Page
unveiled an anti-Clinton commercial in his bid to unseat Rep. Bob
Etheridge. As headlines of Clinton scandals pop on the screen, the
announcer intones: ``Scandal after scandal. Day after day. And who
stands with Bill Clinton, even now? Liberal Bob Etheridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans argue that with a besieged Democrat in the White
House, voters will be even more inclined to keep a Republican
Congress. Even some White House officials say the Lewinsky debacle
has already exacted an ``opportunity cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats began mapping out a strategy in late 1997 for a
unified national message on issues like ``saving'' Social Security,
improving health care and making schools safer. But so far it has
been lost in the swamp of scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans are gleefully waiting to see if there is a
``reverse coattails'' effect, in which Democrats resist having the
president campaign in their states or districts for fear that his
troubles could rub off on them. ``I want to see the first Democrat
who has the guts to haul him into a remotely competitive race,''
said Charles Cook, editor of a nonpartisan political report.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the White House is planning to keep Clinton out of the
conservative South, and to dispatch him to states that might be
reliably hospitable, like New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Backfire Scenario
</P>
<P>
   For all their worries, Democrats are taking solace in polls
showing, at least thus far, that Clinton's high job-approval
ratings are essentially unchanged by the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said he believes the initial shock over
Clinton's confession will subside. ``People will say, `Oh my gosh,
he actually did this?''' he said. ``But when people start thinking
about this in human terms _ not in presidential terms _ they'll
recognize that we all fall from grace. It's human nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also hold out hope for a backlash. One possibility is
that Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, will make
some huge miscalculation that gives Democrats ammunition to cast
him in commercials as a villain on a partisan vendetta. Sometime
this fall, Starr is expected to forward a report to Congress of his
investigation of Clinton that could be the basis for impeachment
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting already to pre-empt Starr, the Democratic Party last
week distributed ``talking points'' (an interesting choice of
words), urging candidates around the country to tell voters that
``rather than politics of personal destruction, Americans deserve
an agenda'' in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats recall that despite fears that the party would lose
its big donors after the Lewinsky scandal broke, many donors were
so furious at Starr that contributions actually increased for a
time. If not Starr, Democrats might try to bait the unpredictable
Gingrich into attacking Clinton, enraging Democrats and drawing
them to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Woodburn, chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party,
is counting on the opposition to be overzealous. ``The Republicans
who are standing close to the fire and fanning the flames are going
to be the ones who get burned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   President Gore
</P>
<P>
   As Democrats weigh whether to distance themselves from Clinton,
Vice President Al Gore already has. He is on vacation for two weeks
in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Remote as it seems, there is always the chance that Clinton will
be forced from his job, thrusting Gore head first into the Oval
Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strange thing is, if Bill Clinton leaves now, all bets are
off in November,'' said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster. ``You
could have an outpouring of support for Al Gore in this time of
great crisis that could immediately change the political landscape.
Or you could have such disgust among the American people that
nobody votes in November.''
</P>
<P>
   As an incumbent, Gore might be in a more commanding position to
win the Democratic nomination in 2000, and perhaps the election. It
could be that voters will want a president who seems too much the
Boy Scout to be a womanizer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet voters may simply want a respite from anyone connected with
Clinton. And Gore is not helped by his own campaign-finance woes.
The Justice Department last week reopened its investigation of Gore
amid evidence that contradicts the vice president's contention that
he did not improperly solicit campaign money from the White House
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it wasn't a bad idea for the vice president to take cover
in Kauai.
</P>
<P>
   `I'm Moral'
</P>
<P>
   The Lewinsky matter is already reverberating among Republicans
running for president. They are wooing the conservative voters who
dominate the primaries _ and stumbling over one another trying to
be the first to call for Clinton's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Already former Vice President Dan Quayle, ex-Gov. Lamar
Alexander of Tennessee, Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri, Sen. Bob
Smith of New Hampshire and Gary Bauer, head of the Family Research
Council, are in the resignation chorus.
</P>
<P>
   While they hardly expect Clinton to heed their advice, a
resignation call makes a sure-fire applause line. Yet the more
candidates cry ``Resign!'' the less likely it is that any of those
candidates will gain political advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the political impact is real: As prominent Republicans
speak heatedly and publicly about Clinton's troubles, that
increases the likelihood that other Republicans will call for the
president's resignation _ and exacerbates partisan tensions.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what, expect Republicans to emphasize their moral
rectitude, and place an even greater premium on candidates with
clean biographies. In fact, the scandal may change the rules:
Potential candidates with any kind of skeleton in the closet may
stay clear of the fray. ``Some Republicans may be tempted to think
they have to run an archbishop to garner votes,'' Dolan said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, maybe Republicans shouldn't get too carried away. While
voters may hope for a modicum of ethics, in the age of Clinton they
no longer seem to expect high virtue.
</P>
<P>
   `Monica Who?'
</P>
<P>
   Under this approach, there is no intersection between the
Lewinsky matter and electoral politics. Instead, people view
Clinton's relationship as having nothing to do with matters closer
to home, like whether their potholes are filled or they are getting
a steady paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   For now, most candidates are so uncertain about the Lewinsky
fallout that they appear to be subscribing to this theory, saying
little about the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster, said Clinton could end up as
something of an afterthought in the campaigns this year. ``The
president is less relevant in this election cycle than he has been
in previous years,'' he said. ``That's because one party doesn't
want to run against him, and one party doesn't want to run with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about an isolated president.
</P>
<P>
   A Hobbled Clinton
</P>
<P>
   For all their cries for Clinton to resign, it's pretty much
conventional wisdom now that this may be the last thing Republicans
want. Once they get past November, it may be in Republicans' best
interest to keep a beleaguered Democratic president beleaguered _
and in office. The longer the Lewinsky matter drags on, presumably,
the less influence Clinton will have on Capitol Hill and the less
unified the Democratic Party will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truth has a way of marching on,'' said Rep. Dick Armey of
Texas, the majority leader, ``and I think truth has not yet
completed its journey in this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: The Republicans are not about to let Monica
Lewinsky fade away.

TINY COMMUNITY COMBINES SUBLIME WITH SURREAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE LOS ANGELES, Calif. -- Somewhere between the postcard ideal
of small-town America and a weirder, more disturbing reality lies
this quiet Antelope Valley community.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty miles north of its metropolitan namesake and 25 miles
from the nearest post office, this high-desert bedroom town of
14,000 is a place of extreme, even surreal contrasts.
</P>
<P>
   Of friendly greetings and simmering resentments. Of tidy ranch
houses and ghostly rows of abandoned homes. Of majestic buttes and
hazy mountains offset by animal pens scarred with graffiti and
front lawns littered with trash.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, it's a place divided between those who stay because they
love it and those who stay simply because they are stuck. With the
collapse of the aerospace and defense industries in the early
1990s, Lake Los Angeles has suffered from many of the same problems
that afflict neighboring Palmdale and Lancaster, including a rash
of drug-related crime and a surge in low-income transients lured
here by plunging rents and high vacancy rates.
</P>
<P>
   Even the community's name hints at a contradiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always say, I like Lake Los Angeles, but there ain't no lake
and it ain't near Los Angeles,'' said Barbara Crane, 70, a retiree
who moved here in 1958 to teach school and now says she can't
imagine living anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Since its first scattered housing tracts rose from the desert
floor in the late 1960s -- around an artificial pond that dried up
years ago -- Lake Los Angeles has struggled to construct an
identity. Few Angelenos know it exists, much less where to find it.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the community got on the map -- though not for
reasons anyone liked. On July 23, Mike and Kathleen ``Katrina''
Gentry were charged with murder and child abuse in the starvation
death of their severely disabled teen-age daughter. When she died
Feb. 6, 1996, Lindsay Gentry, 15, was 4 feet 8 inches tall and
weighed less than 50 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors have rallied around the popular, churchgoing couple,
raising money for their legal defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us are in the courtroom, so unless you have evidence
yourself, it's all B.S., know what I mean?'' said Jenny Keys, 34,
echoing a prevailing feeling among locals.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the incident seems to underscore the ambivalent nature of a
community that still likes to think of itself as a peaceful country
village, but in some ways has begun to act like a troubled inner
city.
</P>
<P>
   Glimpsed from a passing car along dusty Palmdale Boulevard, Lake
Los Angeles appears to be a picturesque oasis in a singularly
unforgiving environment.
</P>
<P>
   Residents love to talk about the area's soul-stirring solitude
and natural splendor. Indeed, the dramatic backdrop of the Angeles
National Forest and the miles of gnarly Joshua trees stretching
across the horizon speak eloquently enough for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people who pass through the desert see nothing but
brown,'' said John Donovan, pastor of Spirit of Christ Lutheran
Church, a bustling storefront operation in a strip mall off the
main drag of 170th Street East. ``There's a lot of beautiful things
in the desert, but if you drive right through, you won't see it.''
</P>
<P>
   To Keys, 34, and her husband Robert, 41, refugees from L.A.'s
San Fernando Valley, Lake Los Angeles is the best of all possible
worlds. Where else can you find cheap housing, solid schools,
mind-blowing scenery and small-town ambience an hour's drive from
the city?
</P>
<P>
   ``We can live here and be wonderful, little happy Okies, and
still go down to the theater, to the beach. I can see `Phantom (of
the Opera),' '' said Jenny Keys, who runs Swift Digits, a
data-entry firm.
</P>
<P>
   The couple left L.A.'s Chatsworth suburb nine years ago after
some grammar-school children there were found snorting cocaine. Now
they and their four children spend summer nights scanning meteor
showers in the velvet desert sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lay out on our picnic table and watch 'em,'' Jenny Keys
said.
</P>
<P>
   This splendid isolation comes at a price.
</P>
<P>
   There's not a supermarket in sight, not a medical clinic,
pharmacy or movie theater. Rite Aid's recent announcement that it
plans to open a store in town was greeted with hosannas.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the U.S. Postal Service is concerned, there
(ITAL)is(END ITAL) no Lake Los Angeles. The area is split between
Lancaster and Palmdale ZIP codes, and it's a 25-mile drive for mail
pickup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the bastard child,'' said one resident.
</P>
<P>
   Locals speak of ``down there'' -- referring to Los Angeles --
with a mixture of envy and disdain.
</P>
<P>
   Many give high marks to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department, whose Lancaster office recently added a second patrol
car to cover the region. And they have mostly good things to say
about county Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich and his efforts to
upgrade the area's outdated infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are longtime complaints about ``second-class
citizenship,'' plus a general perception that the community has
been neglected for 30 years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL 2ND TAKE FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It's not real hard to find people who want to have it both
ways,'' Robert Keys said. ``They want to keep the county rural, but
they're sick and tired of not having any services.''
</P>
<P>
   The first major wave of urban immigrants -- many from the San
Fernando Valley -- began arriving in the early 1980s, driven by
smog, congestion and inflated real estate prices. Spacious,
three-bedroom houses on 1{-acre lots cost $60,000 or less in Lake
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The area then was populated with alfalfa farmers and aerospace
workers from Lockheed and Edwards Air Force Base, whose independent
mind-set set the tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We moved out here because we wanted to be left alone. Just to
be ourselves,'' Crane said.
</P>
<P>
   Nostalgia for a vanishing frontier is reflected in the rustic
street names: High Chaparral Avenue, Frontier Circus, Mackenna's
Gold Avenue, Rawhide Avenue, Jubilee Trail. Several houses sport a
pioneer look, with cacti, imitation wagon wheels and bleached
ornamental steer skulls poking up from their front lawns.
</P>
<P>
   Other homes flaunt the inalienable right to keep anything you
like in your back yard: lumber, llamas, goats, chickens,
above-ground pools, Rottweilers, lowrider cars, archery targets,
rusting hot-water tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Like the monumental landscape around it, life here can be
freakish. A year ago, an 11-year-old boy had to be rescued after
slipping into a crevice in a giant boulder. Warning signs along
Palmdale Boulevard note the stiff fines imposed for abandoning
animals (thousands are left in the desert every year).
</P>
<P>
   Recently, county officials launched a campaign to evict hundreds
of families who have been living in illegal travel trailers, often
without proper toilet facilities or sanitary water.
</P>
<P>
   The incongruities fascinate Heinz Legler, owner of Club Ed, a
movie-location scouting company just outside town, housed in the
set he originally built for ``Eye of the Storm,'' a 1991 desert
gothic thriller starring Dennis Hopper.
</P>
<P>
   The set -- a reproduction of a vintage diner, motel and a
24-hour truck stop -- now is used for TV shoots, commercials and
music videos, as well as feature films.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a certain romance and a certain nostalgia to the
desert and to Route 66,'' said Legler, 46, a native of Stuttgart,
Germany. ``It's that independence, that freedom, which you never
get in Europe. If you come to the United States, you're on your
own.''
</P>
<P>
   Culturally speaking, Lake Los Angeles occupies a buffer zone
between the wild, ornery Old West and the sanitized, subdivided New
West. Wary of ``desert rat'' stereotypes, residents revel in their
isolation and eccentricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, a bunch of crazies come out here,'' Crane said,
laughing. ``We're all a little bit nuts. But there are nuts all
over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   According to real estate agent Maurice Kunkel, inbound migration
peaked between 1983 and 1989. Latecomers found something other than
a desert Eden: a sagging economy, few jobs and growing frustration.
As the recession bottomed out in the early 1990s and property
values sagged, many homeowners walked away from houses that had
lost half their value.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ended up with a lot of HUD repos and bank repos. We're
still dealing with that,'' said Kunkel, who estimates that almost
10 percent of Lake Los Angeles' 3,550 homes are vacant.
</P>
<P>
   Empty houses invite teen-age vandals. Scavengers roll up in
their trucks at night and haul away appliances, chandeliers and
whatever else they can.
</P>
<P>
   ``They take everything but the foundation,'' said sheriff's
Deputy Christopher Keeling.
</P>
<P>
   An unwelcome cottage industry also has developed. Three weeks
ago, sheriff's deputies arrested a Lake Los Angeles man on charges
of possessing chemicals used to make methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 16th meth lab found in the Antelope Valley this year,
and it came four weeks after city, sheriff's and state officials
established a task force to combat the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future out here is very bad,'' said Ken Groden, 65, a
semiretired machinist who moved from L.A.'s Van Nuys suburb 14
years ago, as he busied himself tending a neighbor's garden one
recent morning. Groden said the house he bought then for $62,000 is
now worth only $64,000.
</P>
<P>
   Some long-term residents attribute community problems to recent
arrivals from Los Angeles, some of them on public assistance. But
they empathize with the newcomers' reasons for fleeing Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're leaving (Los Angeles) for the right reasons. They're
getting their kids out of the inner city, but they bring a whole
lot of baggage with them,'' said Dorothea Pickhinke, who with her
husband, Tony, runs the popular Pizza Factory (``We toss 'em,
they're awesome!'').

   John Finnigan is a man with a dream. The gadfly from
Massachusetts was here in the early 1980s, when the lake was
allowed to dry up because of rising maintenance costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you, it broke our hearts. It was like the end of the
world,'' the 21-year resident said.
</P>
<P>
   Now Finnigan is helping lead a drive to restore the lake at an
estimated cost of $700,000. So far, a committee has rounded up
1,600 signatures supporting the plan, but the county has demanded
an engineering study first. A new lake would have to meet
flood-control standards and likely would need to be sealed with
concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Whether residents will want to pick up the tab is uncertain. But
some hopeful residents predict their property values could double
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lake means so much out here; it'll give the people a
lift,'' Finnigan said. ``It'll make life a little bit easier
instead of going down to Santa Monica, know what I mean?''
</P>
<P>
   Looking across this spare, deceptive landscape, you seem to be
looking back across time, thousands of years ago, when American
Indians lived on what was then a verdant plain. When the water
supply dwindled, the Antelope Valley changed forever.
</P>
<P>
   Now water has become a symbol of renewal for a community in
flux.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many people thrown together so quickly, I can't
even predict what Lake Los Angeles will be like in five years, let
alone 10 or 15 years,'' Robert Keys said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAGAPONACK, N.Y. _ Ira Rennert's dream house in the Hamptons
will have 29 bedrooms, 39 bathrooms, a 164-seat theater and a
restaurant-sized kitchen with five refrigerators, six sinks and a
1,500-gallon grease trap.
</P>
<P>
   Its outbuildings will include a sports pavilion with two tennis
courts, two bowling alleys and a basketball court; a garage
sufficient for 200 cars, and a power plant with four huge water
tanks, a 2.5-million-BTU furnace and a maze of underground tunnels.
</P>
<P>
   The 63-acre, five-building spread, at the rim of the Atlantic
Ocean, will dwarf the White House, San Simeon and Bill Gates'
megamansion. All told, the structures will occupy 110,000 square
feet, making the residence at Fair Field, as the site is known, the
largest home in America.
</P>
<P>
   Can a complex of such staggering dimensions be considered a
single-family home?
</P>
<P>
   This is the question being asked by the Sagaponack Homeowners'
Association, an ad hoc group of wealthy residents who are
challenging Rennert's building permits, granted in the dead of
winter when his prospective neighbors were 100 miles away in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   Rennert's grandiose plans have produced protest and speculation
among the Masters of the Universe who summer here, where private
tennis courts are commonplace, squadrons of gardeners tend
manicured lawns and the neighborhood market sells lobster salad for
$40 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   The homeowners have raised $70,000 to plead their case on two
fronts, before the town's Zoning Board of Appeals, which held a
hearing Thursday night, and in state Supreme Court, where a trial
date will be set after the board rules. In both venues they argue
that Rennert, a reclusive industrialist with a passion for Zionist
causes, has misrepresented his plans, claiming to build a residence
in order to avoid municipal scrutiny when he actually intends the
complex for a religious school or conference center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what it is,'' said Joe Zicherman, a money manager
who can see the clouds of construction dust and hear the growl of
trucks from his own four-acre hideaway, where he trades stock in
bare feet and Bermuda shorts, a Cuban cigar clenched in his teeth.
``I just know what it is not: It is not a one-family house.''
</P>
<P>
   As the land clearing goes ahead, much of the talk at the post
office and the Sagg Main General Store is wild and scurrilous
rumor. But some of the neighbors' concerns are grounded in the
plans for the complex. Zicherman, who donated $10,000 to the
homeowners' association, worried that 8,800 square feet of the main
house had no specified use. ``He could be building, for all I know,
a nuclear reactor,'' Zicherman said.
</P>
<P>
   He also wondered, given local concerns about the water supply,
whether ``I'm going to have water to shower after Mrs. Rennert
waters her 17 acres of English gardens.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Berman, who is building a 4,000-square-foot house adjacent
to the Rennert property, nearly wept at the prospect of overlooking
his power plant, garage and garbage area. And author Linda Bird
Franke, whose 2,500-square-foot home also overlooks the Rennert
spread, feared that the high beams of security lights in her eyes
would keep her from enjoying the glow of the silvery moon.
</P>
<P>
   Rennert, a 63-year-old Brooklyn native, has refused all
invitations to meet his neighbors or speak to reporters. His only
comment has been a two-paragraph letter to the Southampton Press,
promising to use the property ``as a private residence for the use
and enjoyment of my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Rennert paid $11 million for the land. His filings estimate
construction costs at $3 million, but independent experts say the
project will cost anywhere from $30 million to $100 million,
depending on the detail.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyers conceded that the residence, made of limestone in
the classic style of the Frick Museum, is the largest they have
ever seen. But that does not make it illegal, they said, nor does
its system of service structures more common to commercial
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The battle began in earnest when 300 people mobbed the Town Hall
in Southampton for Thursday's hearing, an event unprecedented in
both size and passion. Instead of the usual requests for variances
for swimming pools or garden sheds, the five-member appeals board
faced a battery of lawyers, engineers, land-use experts and
citizens armed with architectural renderings, thick reports, aerial
photos and no end of outrage.
</P>
<P>
   John Shea, the lawyer for the homeowners' association, framed
the debate by asking if Rennert would be allowed to build a car
wash or an office building on his property, as long as he said he
would live in it with his wife and three grown children.
</P>
<P>
   His question drew grins from the board members, who have the
legal authority to revoke the building permits if they feel they
were granted in error. Association members begged the board to rule
boldly, despite concern by the town elders that Rennert will sue if
his plans are thwarted.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Then a parade of expert witnesses took the project apart.
</P>
<P>
   One discussed the construction methods, sanitary and plumbing
facilities, kitchen, laundry and mechanical systems and concluded
that they were comparable to a hotel or conference center.
</P>
<P>
   Another said he looked in vain for a similar home or even
apartment building in the region and found none, so instead was
forced to measure Fair Field against Gurney's Inn, a resort in
Montauk. In most ways, Gurney's fell short.
</P>
<P>
   A third spoke of the regional planning policies here, which for
decades have sought to preserve residential character, agricultural
land and scenic vistas. Even a subdivision would be better than the
Rennert complex, some here said, because the town code would allow
a developer to build 21 houses but require that two-thirds of the
land be set aside for farming.
</P>
<P>
   Technical testimony soon gave way to public theater. Shea asked
the board members to imagine making an apple pie. Then he pulled
from his briefcase a sack of lemons and tried to persuade them,
with broad irony, that there was no difference between one fruit
and the other.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Dilworth, a homeowner, cited the maxim that a creature that
walked like a duck and quacked like a duck was probably a duck.
Sheila Bialek, another homeowner, recalled the fairy tale about the
emperor's new clothes and begged the panel not to be bamboozled.
</P>
<P>
   Rennert's lawyers were scornful of the show. ``Law is not
chance, frivolity or silliness,'' said Anthony Tohill. ``We do not
argue based on ducks, fairy tales or lemons.''
</P>
<P>
   After decades of anonymous success, Rennert has been profiled in
several glossy magazines since his project was approved last winter
by the town's Architectural Review Board, which rejected only a
16-foot hedge and a pair of gatehouses. No members of that board
were available to explain their ruling that the project was
``harmonious'' with its surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   Rennert's holding company, Renco Group, is commonly said to
gross $2.5 billion a year, although its records are not public,
while Rennert's personal net worth is said to be in excess of $500
million. His business strategy is a 1980s classic: buying troubled
companies cheap and leveraging them for the next purchase.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of AM General, which manufactures the Humvee
vehicle popularized during the Persian Gulf War, most of Rennert's
companies are Rust Belt concerns. Environmental practices at
Renco's mining companies in Ohio, Utah and Missouri have resulted
in federal lawsuits, state reports, and pages and pages of
violations.
</P>
<P>
   Rennert, with homes on Park Avenue and in Atlantic Beach, is a
generous donor to Orthodox Jewish and Zionist causes. He is said to
be a financial supporter of the career of Benjamin Netanyahu, the
hard-line prime minister of Israel, and contributed to the
construction of a controversial archeological tunnel under Muslim
and Jewish religious shrines in Jerusalem that was the focus of
riots in 1996 in which 70 people died.
</P>
<P>
   An ugly sidelight of the dispute, some residents say, is the
discussion of Rennert's religion. John White, whose family has
farmed here for 300 years, opposes the project, but noted that some
``nasty and anti-Semitic'' remarks have been made by relative
newcomers who ``come out from the city in limousines'' and
themselves built houses too grand for the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are valid reasons for opposition,'' he said, ``without
going after the character of Mr. Rennert.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the homeowners' association, most of them Jewish,
have been advised by their lawyer to play down their concerns about
a religious school on the site. Mrs. Bialek tried to raise the
subject several times during an interview and was hushed by her
husband, Joe, a real-estate developer and an officer of the
association.
</P>
<P>
   Rennert did not attend Thursday's hearing, which will resume
next week. Shea, the lawyer for the homeowners, asked if a bigger
hall could be found for the next session to accommodate the
overflow crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could we go to the high school, or a church?'' he asked. ``How
about Rennert's house?''  &QL;

RUSSIANS EXPECT BAD TIMES TO GET EVEN WORSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KALUGA, Russia _ It has been a long time since anyone in this
pretty but forlorn city on the Oka River in central Russia heard
any good economic news. Local industrial and agricultural
production has dropped 22 percent in the last four years. Doctors,
teachers and most factory workers have not been paid in months and
their salaries, when they get them, are on the average a paltry
$110 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Bad news, on the other hand, arrives regularly. This week, while
the ruble tumbled, it was coming in by the truckload as shipments
of imported goods pulled up to Kaluga's crowded street market with
prices on Turkish jackets, Polish boots and Korean blankets already
as much as 10 percent higher.
</P>
<P>
   In these circumstances, what is a Kaluga street vendor to do?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have raised our prices a little, but there is so much
competition we can't raise them too high,'' said Oleg, 34, who left
his job at a local military plant four years ago to try his hand at
selling shoes. ``If you raise them too high,'' added Oleg, who
would not give his last name, ``people won't buy because they just
don't have the money.''
</P>
<P>
   As the value of the ruble fell after the Russian government's
sudden shift in economic policy, people here in Kaluga, 100 miles
south of Moscow, were poised for the worst. Many flocked to the
local offices of Russia's government-backed savings bank, some to
withdraw funds, others to switch their accounts from rubles to
dollars, which, to their relief, they discovered they could do.
Only a few managed to exchange rubles to dollars before local
currency offices were shut down early Monday afternoon. Others
found refuge in jewelry shops.
</P>
<P>
   Four days after the crisis hit, early signs of panic had
subsided. When the currency offices reopened on Wednesday, the
ruble was trading at roughly 7.9 to the dollar, a drop of 15
percent from last week's levels, but less than the 30 percent
plunge some had feared.
</P>
<P>
   Prices were going up, but in a country where everyone, including
the government and the banks, is running out of money, that does
not necessarily mean inflation; it just means people are going to
have to do with even less than the little they have.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Russia, it is just a matter of survival,'' said Lena
Petrukhina, 27, who sells shoes in a tent next to Oleg. ``Right
now, things are very tense. I don't see how it will get any better,
if it ever does get better. ''
</P>
<P>
   For most people in Kaluga, this week has been just another
chapter in a crisis that dates from 1991, to the collapse of
Communism and of a way of life that was, if nothing else, secure.
Since then, they have lived through worse: The soaring inflation of
the early 1990s utterly wiped out people's Soviet-era savings. This
time, their savings accounts have remained secure _ at least for
now.
</P>
<P>
   What has made this week's events so painful, and so bitter, was
the reminder that the seven-year crisis is not over, not by a long
shot. A year ago, the Kaluga regional government thought that by
1999 the region would be on the threshold of economic growth. Last
week, its expectations, already lowered, were that the economy next
year would stay at 1998 levels. By the end of this week, Maxim
Akimov, deputy director of the region's economic department, was
predicting things would only get worse.
</P>
<P>
   Akimov, 28, is not so worried about inflation, or the value of
the ruble, which he, like many others, now believes will be held at
more or less its current level by the Central Bank. His worries are
about the freeze on capital investment, domestic and foreign, that
this region of 1.1 million sorely needs to pull itself out of its
economic mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main problem is how debt crisis affects investments,'' he
said. ``The reaction of capital markets will be, `Better not to
even touch Russia,' and who can blame them? If I were an investor,
I would take my money and run.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Like so much of Russia, the Kaluga region was heavily dependent
on the military-industrial complex, which here, as elsewhere, has
sunk into terminal depression. Factories that once employed 14,000
now employ 4,000 and those that still have jobs have seen paychecks
buried in a mountain of backed-up debt, starting with $34 million
the Russian Defense Ministry still owes the region for unpaid
orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can name you 10 factories in the whole region that pay their
workers on time,'' said Yuri Rastorguyev, business manager at the
local government newspaper, Vest. ``So you can understand, if
people haven't gotten their salaries in six months, and they raise
prices, where does that leave them? Basically, the system is in
total collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet people do survive, or as Denis Skyanik, a 25-year-old
violinist, noted, ``nobody is going to die of hunger.'' In his
case, he supplements his 300-ruble monthly salary from the Kaluga
Orchestra by playing on a street corner, weather permitting. He
also plays at parties. ``Russians like to drink and have fun,'' he
said. ``So that business will always be there.''
</P>
<P>
   To make ends meet, Igor Babichev, editor of a private financial
newspaper that by his own admission makes no money, sold shoes,
imported Spanish wine and dabbled in real estate before settling on
a side business of campaign consulting. ``Everybody here has a
hobby,'' he said almost cheerily, ``and no one will tell you how
much they earn.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting a handle on Kaluga's economy is one the local
government's next orders of business. According to Akimov, traders
on the Kaluga street markets will soon be required to install cash
registers, to issue sales slips and to pay a single simplified tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some people, it will make life easier,'' he said, ``but
there is no doubt it will be a lot harder for those who aren't
paying any taxes, and they are many.''
</P>
<P>
   The drop in the value of the ruble could prove a boon for local
industries that produce consumer products, from building materials
to food processing, Akimov said. But such industries account for
only 13 percent of local production, another harsh legacy from the
Soviet era, and many of those have done little to adapt to a market
economy.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, Kaluga gets 40 percent of its food and 70 percent of
its consumer goods from abroad, a fact that many see as an example
of their economic humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before in Soviet times, people had money, but they had nothing
to buy,'' said Alexei Slabov, a political commentator for the
newspaper Vest. ``Now they can buy anything they want, but they
have no money. Basically, it comes to the same thing. Nothing has
changed.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   KHARTOUM, Sudan _ Abdel Rahman Ibrahim el-Khalifa is a
Western-trained lawyer, a member of the governing Islamic party and
until recently Sudan's attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a perfectly pressed safari suit and seated in front
of windows that allowed a breeze into the stifling heat of his law
offices Saturday, he expressed some commonly held views here about
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in the good books of the Americans, you are an
angel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are not a friend, you are a pariah,'' he added with
disgust. ``They set the standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Why, he asked, did the United States strike at a Sudanese plant
that Washington contends was financed by the Islamic militant Osama
bin Laden, when bin Laden has many investments in Saudi Arabia that
remain unscathed?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't you say everything he invested in in Saudi Arabia
should be bombarded?'' Khalifa said, rejecting Washington's
argument that the pharmaceutical plant was a cover for the
production of a precursor to nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, two days after the plant on the outskirts of the
capital was destroyed by American cruise missiles, the venting of
fury at the United States proceeded in full force. In the dusty
street below Khalifa's office, young anti-American demonstrators,
let out of school early, marched by. Khalifa, who attended McGill
University in Montreal, gave them a clenched-fist salute and a
thumbs up.
</P>
<P>
   And in the heart of the city, thousands more answered the call
of the government and marched, carrying banners and shouting
slogans like: ``Down, down with the U.S.A.! We won't be ruled by
the CIA!''
</P>
<P>
   One banner read, in English, ``No War for Monica,'' a reference
to suggestions that the attacks were meant to deflect American
public attention from the Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the demonstrators were teen-age students, dressed in the
guerrilla-style camouflage uniforms that are the standard school
garb for girls and boys here. There was little of the steely
defiance that is common in some mass demonstrations elsewhere. Many
laughed and giggled as they sauntered along, shouting the lines.
Older people watched from the sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   But at Khartoum University, where the government is generally
viewed with skepticism, most students ignored the rallies and
attended classes. ``Don't believe anything this government says _
anything,'' said one student, a linguist, who would not give his
name.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamic authorities, who have held power since a 1989 coup,
have not won over the general population either, but manage to
remain in charge with the help of an efficient network of
informers. They also rely on what seems to be a high tolerance here
for ever-declining living standards.
</P>
<P>
   The government has seized on the American attack to try to
energize sliding support. More street demonstrations against the
United States are expected in the coming days, with some likely to
be led by President Omar Hassan el-Bashir dressed in traditional
white flowing robes and a turban.
</P>
<P>
   Khalifa said it was easy to mobilize anti-American feelings, in
part because the Clinton administration had rejected openings in
the last several years to repair its hostile relationship with
Sudan. The United States has labeled the country a sponsor of
terrorism.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bin Laden, whom Washington accuses of masterminding the
terrorist bombings of two American embassies in East Africa, lived
in Sudan for two years ``as an investor'' but was asked to leave in
1996, Khalifa said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you are part of a family but someone is causing
trouble you ask him to leave,'' Khalifa said of bin Laden's
departure.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer declined to be specific about bin Laden's reasons for
leaving but said there had been ``a lot of fuss'' about him being
in Sudan. Washington had accused the country of harboring bin
Laden, who is accused of being a wealthy terrorist, and had said he
was running training camps for his followers here.
</P>
<P>
   After 1996, Khalifa said, Sudan suggested a dialogue with the
United States, but the Clinton administration rebuffed the
overture.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think this is an Islamic regime that has to be opposed,''
he said. ``We will not be a puppet for another country like the
United States, and if you are not in their pocket they give you a
hard time.''
</P>
<P>
   What he is most bitter about, Khalifa said, is that Washington
has cynically used Sudan as a ``scapegoat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why bombard two countries for the sake of one single person?''
he asked, referring to bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   ``But after hearing the head of state telling lies to his own
people and having a filthy affair with Monica Lewinsky, I can
understand why Americans act in a vulgar way.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The barrage of missiles that fell on Afghanistan
and Sudan last week was a small battle in a war without a
foreseeable end, U.S. leaders are warning _ not the moral
equivalent of war, but war itself, similar in some ways to the long
twilight struggle against the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is, unfortunately, the war of the future,'' Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright said. ``The Osama bin Laden organization
has basically declared war on Americans and has made very clear
that these are all Americans, anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said: ``This is an
evil that is directed at the United States. It's going to
persist.'' And Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering said, ``We
are in this for the long haul.''
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate target of the U.S. missiles had a ready reply: the
real battle has not begun, bin Laden's spokesman told Al-Quds
al-Arabi, a London newspaper, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   As they brace for bin Laden's reply, U.S. military, intelligence
and diplomatic services are charting the contours of a new
battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   Their enemy is a man, not a state, backed by acolytes, not
armies. In this war, where high-tech weapons may prove less
effective than pickups packed with dynamite, bin Laden, the exiled
Saudi terrorist living in Afghanistan, represents something
different _ something that Milt Bearden, a former senior CIA
official, calls ``Terror Inc.''
</P>
<P>
   His organization, such as it is, is unlike any other. It has no
real headquarters and no fixed address to target. It is a coalition
of like-minded warriors living in exile from their homes in Egypt,
Sudan, Pakistan and other Islamic nations riven by religious and
political battles.
</P>
<P>
   The bin Laden organization is global and stateless, according to
U.S. intelligence analyses, more theological than political, driven
by a millennial vision of destroying the United States, driving all
Western influences from the Arab world, abolishing the boundaries
of Islamic nations and making them one, without borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a crusade he's on,'' said L. Paul Bremer, U.S.
ambassador at large for counterterrorism from 1986 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a quantum difference in the way bin Laden looks at
terror,'' he said. ``What we are seeing is a shift to terrorism on
a more theological basis, to groups that are not after precise
political goals. When you start to embrace goals as broad as bin
Laden's, you are no longer constrained by the number of casualties
you incur. You are now in a different game.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the older groups in this deadly contest _ the Palestine
Liberation Organization, even the government of Iran _ have moved
toward the mainstream in the last decade. State-sponsored terrorism
is on the decline; with the exception of Iran, none of the seven
nations on the State Department's terrorist list has been directly
linked to an attack on Americans in years.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence agencies now list only six major Islamic
groups beyond bin Laden's that are active and capable of terror
against Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Four of them _ Hezbollah, the Shiite group based in Lebanon; the
Palestinian groups known as Hamas and Islamic Jihad; and the Armed
Islamic Group of Algeria _ have not recently specifically attacked
Americans, although seven American citizens in Israel were killed
in bombings blamed on Hamas in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   About 3,000 Islamic militants worldwide stand under bin Laden's
banner, according to a forthcoming report to Congress by Kenneth
Katzman, the Congressional Research Service's leading expert on
terrorism.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Many are radical veterans of the Afghan war against Soviet
invaders, a struggle that lasted from 1979 to 1989 and took
hundreds of thousands of lives, and one in which the CIA poured $3
billion into battle.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels fought the Soviet Army in a real war, sheltered in
mountains and caves, and their battlements and bunkers have been
fortified by bin Laden. Their numbers alone make bin Laden's
organization by far the world's largest international terrorist
group.
</P>
<P>
   And if history is a guide, the United States will not fight this
war in the mountains of Afghanistan. The last two superpowers that
tried _ the British in the 19th century and the Soviets in the
1980s _ met bloody defeats.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviets tried to attack the Khost encampment, which was
built by the Afghan rebels, with Scud missiles and with special
forces commandos. They failed.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside bin Laden in Afghanistan stand leading members of the
other two groups _ the Islamic Group and Jihad, both based in Egypt
_ which are skilled in the art of political assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Their resumes include the murder of President Anwar el-Sadat of
Egypt in 1981 and the attempted murder in 1995 of his successor,
Hosni Mubarak, two of the foremost pro-American Arab leaders of the
last generation. These groups have killed 85 tourists in two
attacks in Cairo and Luxor in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to overstate the threat that international terrorism
poses for the United States. Taken together, the handful of
organizations capable of carrying out attacks against Americans
abroad like the bombings of the embassies in Africa this month have
a tiny fraction of the U.S. military's firepower.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, by some measures, is the toll terrorism has taken immense.
Since 1989, the beginning of the end of the Cold War, 98 Americans
have been killed in foreign terrorist attacks. By contrast, on
average, about 85 Americans are killed every year by lightning
bolts.
</P>
<P>
   Coldly stated, Americans are far more likely to be killed by a
bolt from the blue than by a foreign terrorist's bomb.
</P>
<P>
   But the intensity of the coming war of which U.S. leaders are
warning is not accurately measured by body counts. It is measured
by the perception that bin Laden and his followers will continue to
pose a nearly invisible, potentially murderous threat to U.S.
interests and installations everywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   This is why the oratory of U.S. leaders in the last 72 hours has
been the language of war, hammered in by repetition. ``This is
going to be a long-term battle against terrorists who have declared
war on the United States,'' Ms. Albright said. ``That is what Osama
bin Laden did. He basically made clear that all Americans and
American facilities were potential targets, and he used the word
`war.' ''
</P>
<P>
   One of her spokesmen, James Foley said: ``A new era, in effect,
is upon us. It's imperative that the American people understand and
prepare themselves for facing this kind of a threat into the 21st
century for as long as it's necessary to face the threat.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bremer, the nation's counterterrorism ambassador in the
1980s, said: ``There's no such thing as eliminating terror, any
more than eliminating crime. What we're in for, if we're serious
about it, is the kind of sustained effort it took during the Cold
War _ not months, not years, but decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time there is a major terrorist incident American
politicians are always standing with clenched jaws saying we're
serious now. Their attention span always lasts a few months.
Congress has second thoughts about the budget. And everything goes
slack again. It would be a welcome change if the administration can
orchestrate a concerted attack.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what the CIA, among other arms of the U.S. government,
has in mind.
</P>
<P>
   In this asymmetrical war, where a small band of suicidal bombers
can hit the United States harder than the U.S. military can hit
back, ``good intelligence is 80 percent of the battle,'' Bremer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Flush with success in identifying bin Laden as the likely author
of the embassy bombings in Africa, and armed with at least six
years of electronically gathered information and other secret
intelligence on bin Laden, Washington's former ally in the Afghan
war, the intelligence agency now has orders to play offense as well
as defense against the man the world sees as the archenemy of the
West.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a one-shot deal here,'' a senior intelligence
official said. This is ``a real war against terrorism,'' he
continued. And he warned, ``There is a high probability of
retaliation somewhere in this world.''

   BBC-ALUMINUM-BATS (Undated) _ Aluminum alloy bats _ made of a
space-age technology _ have come to dominate and alter the nature
of amateur baseball in the United States by being simply too good:
The bats are far lighter to swing than wood and the ball flies off
faster and harder. Last week the NCAA said that the newest
generation of these bats has become dangerous to players because of
reduced reaction times to hit balls and harmful to the game because
so many hitting records are being broken. The NCAA ordered bat
manufacturers to modify their designs to fit a new
lower-performance standard. The group that regulates high school
sports said it is considering a similar move. By Ed Guzman and Kirk

   WASHINGTON _ The president sets his jaw and shakes his finger.
His aides, friends and fellow Democrats swallow their doubts and
accept, or second, his denials. Seven months later, as evidence
against him mounts, the president sets his jaw and concedes that he
``misled people.'' His aides, friends and fellow Democrats swallow
their pride and confess dismay.
</P>
<P>
   Could they really not have known?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spoken with Bill Clinton many times about this problem,
and he never admitted to me what happened,'' one of them, Sen.
Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, said last week after the president
acknowledged having a relationship ``that was not appropriate''
with Monica Lewinsky. ``But I could always hear it in his voice. I
could feel the pain and embarrassment, and there was never any
doubt in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many others _ not all of them Democrats _ Torricelli chose
not to share that view publicly, and in so choosing he accepted a
set of subtle and elaborate rituals often demanded in public life.
Call them the rules of required hypocrisy. This is roughly how they
work:
</P>
<P>
   A politician professes innocence of wrongdoing. Other people who
owe him their loyalty, or livelihood, or love, may also know him
well enough to doubt him deeply. But they doubt the motives of his
adversaries even more, so they close ranks. As time passes, the
demands of the defense grow greater, and the defenders' own
credibility is at stake. Positions freeze. The politician has,
after all, denied it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a social convention,'' said Letitia Baldridge, the
doyenne of manners who was Jacqueline Kennedy's chief of staff in
the White House. While Miss Baldridge made it clear that she found
no mitigating circumstances in Clinton's deceptions, she said he
was owed deference by his supporters all the same: ``People expect
you to be loyal. When you are in a place of trust, even if those
above you abrogate that trust, you should remain loyal.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as Torricelli put it, ``At a point when a friend has a
problem, you let them come to an admission on their own terms.''
</P>
<P>
   By week's end, Clinton, with his missile strikes on terrorist
outposts abroad, had given politicians yet another occasion to
squelch private doubts in public comments. Even a harsh critic like
Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., said that despite ``a cloud of
mistrust'' over the president, Clinton ``is entitled to the
presumption that his action is based solely on his judgment of the
national interest.''
</P>
<P>
   In her book ``Lying'' (Vintage, 1989), the philosopher Sissela
Bok reflects on the dilemmas faced by doctors who suspect
malpractice by their colleagues or superiors. ``No one likes to be
an informer and to destroy a reputation or a career, perhaps even
mistakenly,'' she wrote. ``One cannot always be certain of one's
suspicions; and in order to support them with clear evidence, steps
may be required that few are willing to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Even journalists, however jaded, are confined to reporting
unflattering accretions of facts, and letting those facts suggest,
but not confirm, conclusions. It was not until after the
president's own carefully couched confession, after all, that the
New York tabloids felt free at last to call him a liar in their
front-page headlines.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The problem is that President Clinton has always been a
politician who plays by his own rules: Never give people more
information than they know, never use active words when passive
words will do, accept responsibility but place blame elsewhere,
excuse yourself within any admission. So people who abide by the
more conventional rules of required hypocrisy when they deal with
him almost always get burned.
</P>
<P>
   Take Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. She sat in the front row of
the Roosevelt Room in the West Wing on Jan. 26, feet from Clinton's
stern face, when he insisted, ``I did not have sexual relations
with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.'' What's more, the senator's
friends said, Clinton privately assured her that Ms. Lewinsky had
been transferred from the White House because she fantasized about
him and was ``on the verge of stalking him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Feinstein later issued a statement denying such a talk, but
when she finally allowed last week, ``My trust in his credibility
has been badly shattered,'' friends said the comment only began to
suggest the depth of her true distaste for the president's
deceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, White House political aides like Paul Begala and Rahm
Emanuel who defended the president vigorously all year decided to
do so only after receiving assurances from Clinton's lawyers that
he was not making precisely the semantic distinctions among sexual
activities that he and his lawyers are now making.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some politicians follow the rules more cynically. ``A
lot of people who supported him are now saying, `I'm outraged' for
the benefit of the voters back home,'' Miss Baldridge said.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Art of Lying'' (Red Brick Press, 1998), a current book
of pocket philosophy that Clinton's disappointed friends might be
tempted to recommend, the author, Kazuo Sakai, writes: ``A healthy
psyche is not entirely based on the ability to tell the truth. A
healthy psyche includes the ability to skillfully control the use
of lies and the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Mayor Edward Koch of New York is as candid a politician
as the modern era has produced. But even he used to sign his most
sarcastic, stinging letters to critics like Rep. Charles Rangel,
``All the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Valenti served as an aide to Lyndon B. Johnson, the
president whose deceptions about Vietnam prompted the coining of
the phrase ``credibility gap.'' But he insisted last week that his
president had never lied to him personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think there are some limits,'' Valenti said. ``If LBJ had
said to me that `This is the truth,' and then if I found out he was
deliberately lying to me, maybe I would let slip these bonds of
loyalty,'' and quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``But on the other hand,'' Valenti added, ``I would probably
seek a private audience and try to ascertain how he could have done
it, and then I'd probably go out and defend him in some way. It's
just how I was raised, and I'm too old to change now.''

ARMS INSPECTOR SAYS HE MAY TEST IRAQI RESOLVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ak) 
 By PAUL LEWIS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The chief U.N. arms inspector for Iraq, Richard
Butler, warned Friday that he might soon test Baghdad's resolve to
block further weapons inspections by sending his team to examine a
new site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not rule this out,'' said Butler, the Australian diplomat
who heads the U.N. Special Commission, or UNSCOM, which is charged
with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. ``We have
plenty of interesting information, and it is I who decide when to
launch an inspection.''
</P>
<P>
   The arms inspectors must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
before the Security Council will lift economic sanctions imposed in
1990 after Iraq invaded Kuwait, touching off the 1991 Persian Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Iraqis block us, then obviously we can't do the
inspection,'' Butler continued in an interview, adding, ``but I
simply don't know what the Security Council would do then.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 17, the Security Council called Iraq's refusal to allow
the inspectors to visit new sites ``totally unacceptable'' and
instructed the inspectors to continue their work. But it studiously
avoided making any new threats against Iraq or saying what it would
do if the inspectors were stopped.
</P>
<P>
   In an article on the opinion page of The New York Times that
day, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the commission had
planned ``some particularly intrusive inspections'' this month,
which Butler, consulting with her, canceled after Iraq broke off
cooperation with the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some in the Security Council would have muddied the waters by
claiming again that UNSCOM had provoked Iraq,'' Albright wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But a fresh standoff now between Iraq and the arms inspectors
would increase the pressure on the Security Council to acknowledge
that its orders are being flouted and to decide on a suitable
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Many diplomats here have noted the contrast between the Clinton
administration's willingness to use force against terrorist
organizations in Afghanistan and Sudan last week and its reluctance
to threaten any similar action against President Saddam Hussein of
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Since Aug. 5, when Iraq said it would no longer allow the
inspectors to visit new sites, the 100-member U.N. inspection team
has been confined to monitoring those it has already inspected to
insure that they are not used for making prohibited weapons again.
</P>
<P>
   Butler said he expected Iraq to begin a new vilification
campaign against him and his commission on Monday when the U.N.
mediator in Iraq, Prakash Shah of India, briefs the Security
Council on his unsuccessful efforts to persuade Iraq to resume
cooperation with the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fully expect a stepped-up campaign in the Baghdad press and
from senior officials, accusing us of being American stooges
responsible for all the suffering of the Iraqi people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have done it before and they will do it again. The aim is
simply to create a smoke screen around their refusal to cooperate
or to give me the information I asked for.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Butler said that on four occasions in 1997 and 1998, independent
teams of experts from as many as 15 countries examined Iraq's
account of its biological weapons program and pronounced it ``not
even remotely credible.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that for the first four years after the gulf war,
Iraq denied having developed any biological weapons at all, only
admitting that it sought to produce them in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in the chemical weapons field, Butler said Iraq began
by admitting to having made only 200 liters of the deadly nerve
agent known as VX, which proved unstable and could therefore never
be used in weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, he said, the special commission has now established
that Iraq manufactured some 3,900 liters of VX. Inside broken bomb
casings, it has also found traces of both VX and the chemical used
to stabilize it, which shows that Iraq did develop VX weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Butler said he suspected that Iraq might be modifying
its Volga and Al Samoud missiles to give them a range of more than
150 kilometers, about 95 miles, which is prohibited by the Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I asked them to stop,'' he said, ``they refused and said
I could monitor the missiles. But what chance is there of
successful monitoring when they've suspended cooperation?'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dee Jenkins was never much for T-bones or rib eyes, but she was
always a sucker for a good burger. That is, until Maggie the cow
came along.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jenkins and her husband, who live in the Catskill
Mountains, bought her four years ago. Their motive was fresh milk,
but the cow quickly became more than dairy in Mrs. Jenkins' eyes.
Maggie came when called and was loquacious with her mooing,
seemingly trying to communicate. She followed the car up the
driveway.
</P>
<P>
   When Maggie gave birth to a bull, Augie, Mrs. Jenkins figured he
would be slaughtered eventually. But he was just like mom, gentle
and loyal and smart. He's now a 2-year-old, 800-pound pet, and
burgers don't sit as well in Mrs. Jenkins' stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard, once you've had a one-on-one relationship,'' Mrs.
Jenkins said, adding that she is close to banishing beef entirely
from her diet. ``I mean, you'd never eat a dog or cat.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind Mrs. Jenkins' conversion to bovine appreciation lies a
serious question: Is there really any hard logic to which animals
Americans exempt from consumption, and which ones they exploit? Is
the triage of concern for different breeds _ whether they are
eaten, used in experiments or simply eliminated as pests _ a matter
of sense or sentimentality?
</P>
<P>
   A ballot initiative in California also raises this question. In
November, voters there will decide whether to criminalize the sale
of unwanted horses for slaughter and export to meat shops in
Belgium, France and Japan, where many people see little difference
between Maggie and Flicka, who are protein all the same.
</P>
<P>
   Some who support the referendum eat beef and pork, despite the
fact that cows and pigs are intelligent enough and, under the right
circumstances, every bit as lovable as horses. Just ask Mrs.
Jenkins, or anyone swept up in the modest craze for Vietnamese
potbellied pigs a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any great rhyme or reason to this,''
said Dr. John Saidla, who teaches ethics at the veterinary school
at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Animal experts said that Americans often assume that those
animals with whom they have formed the closest bonds _ dogs, cat
and horses, for example _ are smarter or more affectionate than
those they eat, but that appraisal is sometimes as subjective as it
is scientific.
</P>
<P>
   They said the different treatment of these breeds is explained
in part by what they called the social contracts people have
developed with certain species. The more often we turn to a given
type of animal for services beyond nutrition, the more likely we
are to feel squeamish about eating it. It feels too much like a
betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   Horses once carried soldiers into battle; they now provide sport
for equestrians. Although there were those who promoted it, pig
racing never really caught on, and a game of polo using sheep would
be a little awkward.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Caras, president of the American Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, said that dogs became pets and
not prey in part because the earliest breeds were relatively small,
offering paltry portions of meat. Wild boar, by contrast, were
four-legged buffets, and today's pigs bear the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Often intelligence is indeed a factor in the degrees of concern
felt for different animals. The special outcry over medical
experimentation on primates arises from the knowledge that they are
extraordinarily bright, more like humans than any other animals.
</P>
<P>
   But why do rabbits elicit more concern than guinea pigs, who may
be equally smart? Some animal experts said it's pure public
relations. Rabbits have Easter and Peter Cottontail on their side;
guinea pigs, by dint of linguistic misfortune, are metaphors for
hapless pioneers, and thus deemed appropriate in that role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of this is about fairy tales,'' Saidla said. ``It's about
movies.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also about looks. People have shown a fairly consistent
preference, for example, for the fluffy and the big-eyed. That's
one advantage squirrels have over rats, although experts said they
are strikingly alike. ``Both are potentially plague carriers,''
noted Randy Lockwood, an executive with the Humane Society of the
United States who studies human-animal relationships.
</P>
<P>
   John Gittleman, a biology professor at the University of
Virginia, said more money is spent on the conservation of red
wolves than gray because of prejudice. ``Color has a lot to do with
the way we perceive things, why certain carnivores seem less
threatening to us than others,'' Gittleman said. ``The red wolf
also has a smaller, rounder face _ it looks more cuddly.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The sometimes arbitrary nature of human judgment is reflected in
the way it changes. A bat clinging to the eaves was once cause for
shudders and maybe a call to the exterminator (bats can carry
rabies); increasingly, Lockwood noted, suburbanites are erecting
bat houses, in belated appreciation of the beast's rapacious
appetite for mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, many rules collapse in the face of need. Caras noted
that while dogs were once held in totemic esteem by some Native
American tribes, dogs slipped off that pedestal when meat became
scarce.
</P>
<P>
   ``In crisis,'' Caras said, ``we will eat anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, some people elevate animals they feel they can
afford to: rabbits because there are guinea pigs and rats to take
up the laboratory slack; minks because there are synthetic sources
of warmth; horses because there are plenty of cattle and they don't
bring to mind ``Black Beauty'' or ``National Velvet.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for Mrs. Jenkins. Long ago, she swore off veal: too sad,
the way those calves were treated. She gave up lamb: too fleecy,
too meek. She never considered venison: too much like Bambi's
mother, chased through the woods by hunters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a hair away from being a vegetarian,'' she said proudly,
and then reflected on how differently even those closest to her see
the world. Her husband, Lee, still enjoys his sirloin steaks as
much as ever, though he too has grown fond of Maggie and Augie. And
when Mrs. Jenkins recently introduced Augie to her grown son, he
did not find the bull as adorable as she does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom,'' she recalled him saying, ``let me tell you. He'd look
much better beside a baked potato.''

12 YEARS AFTER KILLING, SWEDEN'S WOUND IS DEEPER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WARREN HOGE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM _ The site is so modestly marked that it is easy to
miss. Perhaps appropriately, one must bow one's head to see it.
</P>
<P>
   The simple brass plaque in the pavement at the Tunnelgatan
entrance to the Hotorget subway station reads, ``On this spot
Sweden's Prime Minister Olof Palme was killed.''
</P>
<P>
   People by the scores find it daily, though, drawn to the site
where many Swedes think their country began to lose its way.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Palme was killed, we were an innocent, virgin country,''
said Nina Ersman, a Swedish diplomat, expressing the common view
that the assassination profoundly altered Sweden's view of itself
as the unassailable guardian of the world's social conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Palme, a statesman who aroused intense opinions by speaking out
forcefully against apartheid in South Africa, U.S. actions in the
war in Vietnam and intolerance in general, was shot in the back by
a lone gunman on the night of Feb. 28, 1986, as he was walking home
from the movies with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 years since that convulsive event have not been kind to
Sweden's sense of itself as decent, efficient and distant from the
tensions and treacheries of the rest of the world. If a certain
fatalism took hold of the country at that moment, it has been
deepened by the hapless performance of the police, which has left
the case still unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the act itself was a national catastrophe, what has
turned out to be an enormous setback is that the authorities have
been unable to handle the case in a way that has not been open to
criticism,'' said Defense Minister Bjorn von Sydow. ``It has proved
to be too great an event for our local police,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arne Ruth, an author and former editor in chief of the newspaper
Dagens Nyheter, was more blunt. ``After the assassination,'' he
said, ``the total failure of the judicial system to handle the case
was in a way an even worse disaster for Sweden.''
</P>
<P>
   The murder inquiry has been repeatedly sidetracked by disputes
and scandals that have forced the resignations of a justice
minister, a police chief and other officials.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, self-styled ``private investigators'' have
produced increasingly bizarre versions of who was behind the
killing, variously accusing the CIA, the Mafia, NATO, Kurdish
rebels, the mysterious Italian Masonic Lodge Propaganda-2, the
Israeli intelligence agency Mossad, South African defenders of
apartheid, local right-wing businessmen, Stockholm police officers
angered at wage cuts, a Finnish bodybuilder and an unnamed member
of the staff of former President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are mostly made up by sick people,'' said Marten Palme,
the late prime minister's 36-year-old son, who was with his father
the night he was killed. ``I've had some of them call and apologize
to me after they received medication and got better.''
</P>
<P>
   Marten Palme, an associate professor at the Stockholm School of
Economics, said the remaining family _ his mother, Lisbet, 67, and
brothers Joakim, 40, a sociologist, and Mattias, 30, an architect _
are able to largely ignore the continuing furor now. ``The most
important thing for our family is to know what happened that night,
and we feel we do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They are convinced the killer was Christer Pettersson, 51, a
self-confessed drug addict and alcoholic who was convicted of the
murder and sentenced to life in prison in 1989 but then freed later
the same year by an appellate court. He had spent much of the
previous 20 years in jail, with a record of 63 arrests, including
one for having stabbed a drug dealer to death with a bayonet in
1970.
</P>
<P>
   Swedish criminal law is heavily weighted toward defendants'
rights, and the higher court said the evidence used to convict
Pettersson was too circumstantial. He received about $40,000
compensation for wrongful jailing.
</P>
<P>
   An effort by prosecutors to reopen the case against him this
spring failed when a Supreme Court panel ruled on May 27 that new
witness testimony did not justify a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   The justices also faulted prosecutors for failing to establish a
motive and find the .357 Magnum that fired the bullets recovered
from the scene. For years, police divers have been looking for the
revolver in the canals and waterways of Stockholm, a city built on
islands in the Baltic Sea. As for the motive, Swedes have wrestled
with reconciling themselves to the notion that a society they long
proclaimed to be the world's most rational may have been
transformed by a senseless act.
</P>
<P>
   Swedes have burdened the Palme assassination with being the
inspiration for a series of unrelated accidents and violent
episodes over the last dozen years. It has become a familiar if
disjointed recital here _ the sinking of a ferry boat in 1994 that
killed nearly 1,000 people, the machine-gun killing of seven people
by a berserk army lieutenant the same year, the attack a year later
that killed four people and wounded 20 by a young man retaliating
with an assault rifle for having been denied admittance to a
discotheque.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palme assassination introduced a kind of criminality that
we hadn't had before,'' a Swedish diplomat said one recent evening.
</P>
<P>
   Toivo Sjoren, research head of the Sipa opinion survey group,
said a majority of Swedes thought Pettersson was the killer and
distrusted the conspiracy theories. But the theorists persist.
</P>
<P>
   The case is often compared to the investigation of the
assassination of President Kennedy. ``But in the case of President
Kennedy, you had technical evidence and some suggestion of
motivation,'' said Defense Minister von Sydow. ``We're lacking
both.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The night he died, Palme had gone to the downtown Grand Cinema
with his wife, his son Marten and Marten's girlfriend. On leaving,
the Palmes said good night to the younger couple and turned to walk
down Sveavagen, a broad, tree-lined central boulevard. They were
headed for the subway station three blocks away to take a train to
their home.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a remarkable thing for a Swedish prime minister to
move about unprotected, a fact that was to be recalled repeatedly
and ruefully in the aftermath of the murder, as permanent security
guards were assigned to the country's leaders. As they passed an
artists' supply shop on the corner of Tunnelgatan, a figure emerged
from the shadows, fired a shot that passed through Palme's back and
upper chest and a second shot that grazed Mrs. Palme. Then he ran
along the dark side street and up a flight of stone stairs at its
end two blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   No one has ever come forward to say he or she saw the man fire
the gun. At the 1989 trial, Mrs. Palme identified Pettersson as a
man who had glared at her with a hostile expression as her husband
lay dying on the snowy street. The accuracy of her recollection was
challenged by defense lawyers because three years had passed since
the murder.
</P>
<P>
   In court, Pettersson greeted her claim by shouting out, ``Olof
Palme is in his heaven, and he would not like what you are saying,
but if you believe it, it is OK!''
</P>
<P>
   Pettersson has maintained his innocence, saying that at the time
of the shooting he was on a commuter train headed for his suburban
home. He testified that he fell asleep on the train and
accidentally rode to the end of the line.
</P>
<P>
   The new evidence that prosecutors presented to the Supreme Court
in December came from four witnesses, two of whom knew Pettersson
from before, who said they saw him both outside the movie theater
and running down the cross street after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palme investigation is not over,'' Lars Nylen, the
national police commissioner, said in response to the court's
refusal in May to permit a new trial. Tuve Johansson, one of the 15
detectives still working the case, said his men would continue to
seek the weapon and follow up leads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get lots of tips, they're coming in all the time, but they
are mostly ones we have seen before,'' he said. ``It's very
important to find the weapon.'' Asked if they were pursuing anyone
in addition to Pettersson, he said, ``We're not investigating just
him, but he is a very interesting one.''

EXPERTS: LOSERS IN CLINTON-STARR BOUTS MIGHT BE FUTURE PRESIDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's defense of his private conduct
this year has endangered more than his reputation and credibility.
The legal battles he has fought to avoid acknowledging that his
behavior with Monica Lewinsky was inappropriate may have eroded
presidential power and prerogatives for future presidents, legal
experts, constitutional scholars and political scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   The precedents set by court decisions rebuffing Clinton's
efforts to halt a sexual misconduct suit by Paula Jones and prevent
close aides and bodyguards from testifying before a federal grand
jury investigating the Lewinsky matter have profound implications,
experts say. Among them are these:
</P>
<P>
   _ Presidents can now be sued for private conduct while still in
office.
</P>
<P>
   _ Government lawyers may be compelled to disclose advice they
provide to presidents.
</P>
<P>
   _ The notion that executive privilege protects a president's
conversation with his advisers has been restricted.
</P>
<P>
   _ Members of a president's personal security force can be called
to testify about his or her movements, actions and habits.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton voluntarily set a precedent, as the first president
to testify before a grand jury investigating his own actions. One
potential battle, over whether a prosecutor can require a president
to appear by issuing a subpoena, was avoided _ at least for now _
when Clinton agreed to testify. But Starr has told the president
that he still might subpoena him to compel testimony about matters
Clinton declined to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   Not lost on students of the presidency is that these legal
precedents did not flow out of Clinton's efforts to protect
conversations involving national security or sensitive
law-enforcement or economic policy. They resulted from the
president's effort to hide an affair with Ms. Lewinsky that he
later acknowledged. Executive privilege protects conversations
about sensitive government matters between the president and top
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, many of those who ponder the impact on the institution fear
serious consequences, including the potential for more lawsuits
against presidents in office, an inhibition to give presidents
candid advice, a disinclination to write memorandums or diaries,
and difficulty recruiting quality advisers because of the risk of
large legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just been a disaster for the presidency,'' said Harold
Bruff, dean of the University of Colorado Law School.
</P>
<P>
   The president's legal battles continue. The White House asked
the Supreme Court on Friday to overturn a lower court ruling
requiring that some of Clinton's legal advisers testify in the
Lewinsky case.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Rozell, a political science professor at the University of
Pennsylvania and an expert on executive privilege, said: ``I think
much of the Clinton strategy has weakened traditional presidential
power with respect to executive privilege. In part, that's because
they have sent up losing argument after losing argument for what
appears to me to be attempts to delay the Starr investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone lays the blame for erosion of presidential power at
the feet of the Clinton White House. Several scholars and lawyers
also fault Starr for disregarding potential damage to the
presidency in his aggressive pursuit of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Though concepts like executive privilege and attorney-client
confidentiality, which protects conversations between lawyers and
their clients, often have an abstract or theoretical air to the
public, the loss of these prerogatives to presidents can have real
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say the erosion of such powers may make it harder,
for example, for presidents to recruit competent and trusted
advisers. A host of Clinton advisers have been subpoenaed by Starr
and appeared before grand juries investigating accusations of
presidential misconduct, even conduct that took place before the
president was elected. Most have had to pay their own legal bills.
</P>
<P>
   Bruff said he once turned down a job in the White House
counsel's office. ``One of the reasons for rejecting it,'' he said,
``was that I can't risk my family's life savings for potential
legal bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Some lawyers also lament the Supreme Court decision in the Jones
lawsuit that permitted sitting presidents to be sued, a precedent
some consider potentially damaging.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court assumed that because there were so few civil suits
against the president in the past, that there would not be many
such suits in the future,'' said Walter Dellinger, a Duke
University Law School professor and former Solicitor General. ``But
the future is a different world, because no litigant will ever have
to go the Supreme Court again to commence a lawsuit against the
president of the United States. All a litigant has to do is file
suit in any federal or state court.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones' lawyers, among others, say the case reached the High
Court only because Clinton declined to settle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no real desire on their part to settle; they wanted
to wait until the Supreme Court finished,'' said Joseph Cammarata,
one of Mrs. Jones' lawyers at the time. Robert Bennett, Clinton's
lawyer in the Jones case, did not return a telephone call.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some scholars dismiss the notion of any permanent damage to the
presidency and dispute assertions that court decisions will
constrain presidents from confiding in advisers. What is there to
fear, they say, as long as discussions do not involve illegal acts
or abuse of power?
</P>
<P>
   Charles Jones, professor emeritus of political science at the
University of Wisconsin, also does not buy the argument that
compelling the president's bodyguards to testify will mean that he
will seek to avoid them as much as possible. ``Why would he place
his life in jeopardy?'' Jones asked.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of presidential prerogatives is an elastic one,
scholars say. It is not mentioned in the Constitution and is mainly
defined by case law and by whether a president feels confident that
if he asserts it, he will not pay a political price.
</P>
<P>
   It is the latter area, some experts say, where the Clinton
administration has done the most harm, by making it likely that
future presidents will be more hesitant to evoke a principle of
prerogative like executive privilege for fear of political
accusations that they are trying to hide questionable actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it turns out that the president was only covering up his
own embarrassment, it becomes easy for people to say, this wasn't
about principle at all,'' said Peter Shane, a professor at the
University of Pittsburgh Law School who is a former Justice
Department lawyer. ``Now when the next president comes along and
tries to so the same, politically it becomes much harder. People
are going to say, `Wait a minute, this is just another
stonewall.''' &QL;

FOR CLINTON, A VACATION WITH NO GOLF, NO SAILING, NO PARTIES, NO
KENNEDYS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. _ Some vacation.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton fled Washington on Tuesday after the most
excruciating day of his public life, seeking solace and solitude on
Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of the relaxation he had found on previous summer
vacations on the island, this time he confronted the unpleasant job
of trying to repair the damage done to his marriage by his now
painfully public affair with a young White House intern. His staff
in Washington was trying to find a way to heal the breach of trust
with the public from his Monday night revelations. And the opinion
industry was debating whether Clinton was the first figure in
history to try to obstruct justice with a necktie.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the small hours of Thursday morning, he gave the final
order to launch 75 cruise missiles against terrorist targets in the
Sudan and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   President once again, and not just the prodigal husband in the
doghouse and supplicant for national absolution, Clinton donned a
deep blue suit and flew back to Washington to oversee the aftermath
of the attacks. He could concentrate on bomb damage assessment
rather than on personal and political damage control.
</P>
<P>
   The President Is `Pooped'
</P>
<P>
   Clinton returned to the Vineyard on Friday night, spent a quiet
evening at home and slept late Saturday. The president is
``pooped,'' said White House press secretary Mike McCurry. ``He's
had a long week.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for a quiet birthday dinner with Vernon Jordan and his
wife, Ann, on Wednesday, the Clintons have not ventured from their
borrowed estate on Oyster Pond on the south shore of the island. No
golf, no sailing, no parties, no Kennedys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president really hasn't had a vacation yet at the end of
his first week of vacation,'' McCurry said on the flight back to
the island from Washington on Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you count as vacation hours alone with first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton, who was described by friends as embarrassed and
humiliated by her husband's extracurricular behavior and the damage
he has done to his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   No one outside the family really knows what is going on inside
the walls of the summer White House.
</P>
<P>
   But a close friend of the president's who has witnessed previous
family crises said that the family's ``healing'' is a quiet affair,
with a somewhat sheepish president and a frosty first lady warily
circling each other waiting for an opportunity to engage. As the
Clintons left the White House on Tuesday, their daughter, Chelsea,
walked between her father and mother, holding each by the hand.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated in the Vineyard
</P>
<P>
   In his address Monday night, Clinton said he was ``prepared to
do whatever it takes'' to atone to his family. It is not yet known
what that will be, but the early evidence is that Clinton is being
kept on a tight leash on the island.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent summer residents who have socialized with the Clintons
in past summers have not yet heard from them and none will say they
are prepared to call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't sense there's a feeling among people that he's persona
non grata or a pariah or anything else,'' said Ron Rappaport, a
Vineyard native who has attended parties with the Clintons. ``I
think he's a welcome visitor who needs his vacation and needs his
space.''
</P>
<P>
   There may be a reason the Clintons have been reluctant to
venture out. Virtually everyone here with access to a word
processor and an op-ed page has hashed over the president's
behavior during the past seven months. Jules Feiffer, the
cartoonist who has skewered the president repeatedly this year,
doesn't expect to be invited to any events involving the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some strange reason,'' Feiffer said, ``he doesn't come
near me.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Dershowitz, lawyer and author, had the chutzpah to show up
at the airport to greet the Clintons on Tuesday, even though he has
second-guessed Clinton's response to the Starr investigation in
several opinion articles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there for one reason, to show I'm not a fair-weather
friend,'' Dershowitz said. ``I've been somewhat critical of the
president in print. I've not followed the White House line. I don't
think he should be impeached, but I don't agree with everything
he's done.''
</P>
<P>
   A Word in a Puzzle
</P>
<P>
   Given that kind of support, it's not surprising that Clinton is
laying low, reading thrillers and working crossword puzzles.
</P>
<P>
   But even the puzzles don't provide a complete respite. As
Clinton was flying to Martha's Vineyard on Tuesday doing the
crossword puzzle in The New York Times at warp speed, as is his
wont, he was stopped cold by clue 46 down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meal for the humble?'' read the clue, calling for a
four-letter answer.
</P>
<P>
   The president laughed ``in a bemused way,'' said an aide sitting
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's one appropriate for today,'' the president said, and
inked in the answer, ``Crow.''

A TURNCOAT NOW TURNING ON AMERICANS IN CARIBBEAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.Y.)  (js)

<P>
   BASSETERRE, St. Kitts and Nevis _ U.S. law-enforcement officials
regard Charles Miller as one of the most dangerous and powerful
drug traffickers in the Caribbean and have been seeking his
extradition for two years. Now the stakes are higher than ever: the
State Department says he has threatened to kill U.S. college
students enrolled here if the local government hands him over to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Having furnished Miller with his freedom and the identity he now
uses, U.S. authorities have every reason to take that warning
seriously. Less than a decade ago, when he was a police informer
called Cecil Connor, Miller was granted full immunity to testify in
a case against Jamaican drug gangs operating in Florida and New
York. He acknowledged involvement in nine drug-related slayings and
was placed in the federal witness-protection program.
</P>
<P>
   Since returning, with a U.S. passport, to this country, which he
left as a teen-ager, Miller has been linked by law-enforcement
officials to a series of drug-related cases, among them the
killings.
</P>
<P>
   Along with two associates, Miller, who gives his age as 38, is
now wanted in Miami on charges of smuggling nearly a ton of cocaine
to Florida. In 1996, a magistrate here refused to allow Miller to
be extradited to the United States, but his decision was overturned
by a higher court earlier this year, and new hearings on the
petition are scheduled for October.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extremely violent and unstable individual who has
acquired a great deal of wealth and exercises a great deal of
power,'' said a foreign official with long experience in the
region. ``He will stop at nothing to keep from falling into
American hands.'' And since St. Kitts and Nevis is the smallest
nation in the Western Hemisphere, the official noted, with only
46,000 people, ``Just a little bit of effort goes a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller's case is emblematic of the difficulties that the
mini-states of the Caribbean face in their efforts to combat drug
trafficking. More than one-third of the cocaine now consumed in the
United States is believed to be shipped through the region, and
traffickers are increasingly blatant in their efforts to corrupt
governments and encourage local consumption of their product.
</P>
<P>
   At Ross University and in neighborhoods where the school's 280
veterinary students live, protection has been noticeably beefed up,
with agents of the U.S. and local governments as well as private
security. University officials said they hoped the 54 students who
have withdrawn from classes and gone back to the United States will
return when the fall term begins.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department and the government of St. Kitts and Nevis,
which depends heavily on tourism, have emphasized that no blanket
warning to Americans to stay away has been issued.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview here, Prime Minister Denzil Douglas said his
government was cooperating fully with the United States and other
nations to ``increase and improve security,'' adding that local
police ``continue to keep the suspect under surveillance.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller did not respond to telephone messages left for him.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But in a long interview last year, he dismissed the accusations
against him as politically motivated and said he had worked for
U.S. and British intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This government, the British and the Americans, they all wish
Charles Miller would be run over or drop dead,'' he said, because
of his knowledge of ``all the Machiavellian moves that have been
happening here.''
</P>
<P>
   As Miller tells it, he moved to Jamaica in the mid-1970s and was
recruited as a political enforcer by the Jamaica Labor Party. He
says that the CIA trained him and later helped him flee the
Jamaican prison where he was serving a 75-year sentence for armed
robbery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such allegations are utter nonsense,'' Mark Mansfield, a
spokesman for the CIA, said in a telephone interview from the
agency's headquarters in Virginia. ``This individual has never been
employed by or affiliated with the CIA.''
</P>
<P>
   Once in the United States, court records indicate, Miller linked
up with a Jamaica-based gang to sell cocaine and marijuana in Miami
and Rochester, N.Y. But after being arrested, he turned on the gang
to cooperate with prosecutors, giving testimony that led to the
conviction of top leaders of the group, and abandoned his identity
as Cecil Connor.
</P>
<P>
   St. Kitts and Nevis has signed a new treaty, awaiting approval
by the U.S. Congress, that would considerably simplify any future
extradition proceedings. But the measure is not retroactive, and
government officials here say that any attempt to move against
Miller for the threats made here would only further complicate the
existing extradition proceedings. &QL;

   Underground Site May Hide North Korean Nuclear Reactor
</P>
<P>
   When North Korea signed an agreement in 1994 to ``freeze'' its
huge nuclear weapons development program at Yongbyon, north of the
capital of Pyongyang, U.S. officials knew it was not an ideal
accord. The North, they thought, might still be hiding enough
material to make two bombs. And building tunnels is almost a
national sport, which means other nuclear plants may be hidden away
where inspectors cannot roam.
</P>
<P>
   Now U.S. spy satellites have found one: a huge cavern being dug
out under a mountain 25 miles from Yongbyon, with 10,000 to 15,000
workers at the site.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence agencies are fairly certain that it is being
prepared for an underground reactor and reprocessing center, where
nuclear waste is turned to bomb-grade plutonium. But they expect
the North Koreans to claim that it is innocuous _ perhaps a giant
underground parking garage. There's only one problem with that
explanation: The country is so poor it has almost no cars.

   Public Housing May No Longer Be Mostly for the Poor
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans and the Clinton administration are on
the verge of agreeing to legislation that would allow public
housing authorities to give more vacant apartments to working
families.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, federal rules have required that almost
all open public housing units go to the very poor, which has hurt
inner-city neighborhoods, Republicans and many housing experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise bill would not bring about swift change because
waiting lists at most housing authorities are already long. But
housing officials around the country say it will help them begin
marketing campaigns to entice low-income working families.

   Protests in China
</P>
<P>
   Defying a ban, students and women's groups held emotional
protests over the looting, killing and rape directed against ethnic
Chinese during the riots in Indonesia in May.
</P>
<P>
   The rioting initially received scant coverage in China. But
photo essays in two newspapers this month caused an outpouring of
public anger primarily aimed at Indonesian leaders and criticism of
Beijing's response. Moreover, the protests showed a greater
willingness to speak out and the government's slightly greater
tolerance of it.
</P>
<P>
   A Revived Policy
</P>
<P>
   The largest insurance company in Italy, Generali, agreed in
federal court in New York to pay $100 million to Holocaust
survivors and their heirs who were denied payment on life and
annuity policies after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Generali also said it would give lawyers suing other European
insurers confidential documents detailing how competing companies
cooperated with the Nazis to loot policies owned by Jews, putting
pressure on the insurers to settle.

first significant increase in more than 25 years.

of this group.

   Balloonist Fails, Again
</P>
<P>
   Steve Fossett found himself just short of becoming chum when his
balloon plummeted into the shark-infested waters of the South
Pacific. He was two-thirds of the way toward completing an
around-the-world voyage that, if successful, would have made him
the first balloonist to circle the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Fossett, 54, was found off eastern Australia after traveling
15,200 miles since lifting off from Argentina on Aug. 7, breaking
his own distance mark of 10,360 miles set in 1997.

<P>
   Vive the Rule of Law
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't necessarily be a Velvet Revolution. Canada's Supreme
Court said Quebec could legally separate if it did so in accord
with the constitution and with the consent of the rest of Canada.
French-speaking separatists dismissed the court's advisory and
vowed to proceed with plans for provincial elections and another
referendum on independence.

   Justice, 32 Years Later
</P>
<P>
   After four trials ended in deadlock in the 1960s, a former
klansman was found guilty of ordering the firebombing death of a
black civil rights activist in his home in Hattiesburg, Miss.
Samuel Bowers, 73, was convicted of arson and murder in the death
of Vernon Dahmer. Prosecutors said Dahmer was killed for helping
blacks register to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Several ex-Klansmen testified that Bowers, as imperial wizard of
the Ku Klux Klan, had ordered the killing. The verdict carries a
life term.
</P>
<P>
   Assisted Suicide Tally
</P>
<P>
   After Oregon's voters reaffirmed by a solid majority last year
an earlier and much-challenged vote to make theirs the first state
in the union to allow physician-assisted suicide for the terminally
ill, horrified opponents predicted abuse and suicides by the dozens
or hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   So far, according to state figures released last week, only 10
people have been given authorization to take lethal medication
after filling out a one-page form, titled ``Request for medication
to end my life in a humane and dignified manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Of those, the state said, eight had taken the drugs and died,
while the two others died before actually taking the drugs. The
average age at death was 71. Under the law, the drugs can be
prescribed to an adult of sound mind with, in the opinion of two
doctors, less than six months to live. The state's Catholic
Conference, calling the news a ``tragic development,'' said it was
eight deaths too many.

   ETHETE, Wyo. _ In the face of cutbacks brought about by the
overhaul of welfare programs, members of the Northern Arapaho Tribe
on the Wind River Reservation have started a seven-acre community
garden with donated land, seeds and equipment to grow vegetables
for themselves and for the elderly and disabled who cannot work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were concerned that when time runs out, when they are no
longer eligible for government assistance, what are they going to
do for food?'' said Glen Revere, a nutritionist with the Indian
Health Services on the 2.8 million-acre Wind River Reservation,
about 100 miles east of Jackson, Wyo. ``Then we came up with the
idea for this community garden, and it's been bigger than we ever
expected in so many ways.''
</P>
<P>
   At the all-volunteer garden, this is the time of year when
potatoes grow larger than a man's fist, popping out of the soil,
and five-foot-high cornstalks develop ears with red, yellow and
white kernels ripening inside. The conditions on these wide plains
near the Wind River Range of the Rocky Mountains can be harsh, with
high winds, late springs and early autumns limit the growing season
to 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   Revere's partner in this effort is Irene Houser, director of the
Northern Arapaho Tribe Community Services, who has distributed
produce around the Wind River Reservation and to the Pine Ridge
Reservation in southwestern South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Houser, a member of the Northern Arapaho Tribe, said people
were stunned when she brought them bushels of potatoes, onions,
squash, zucchini, tomatoes, beets, radishes and other vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked, `How much are you going to charge me for this?'''
she recalled. ``I said, `It's free,' and they were so happy. Many
of them didn't have food in their house when I showed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Soldierwolf, a 70-year-old father of nine and grandfather
of nine, said: ``That food lasted us about six weeks. We dried some
things, boiled some. Just ate all of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Soldierwolf, a Northern Arapaho who served with the Marines in
World War II and the Korean War, lives with his wife, Florita, one
daughter and one grandchild. They receive food stamps for a
$300-a-month budget for the four of them, but they said they often
fed members of their family who stopped by. Soldierwolf estimated
they saved $70 with the free vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Soldierwolf's family represents the problems that plague many of
the 1.3 million American Indians who live on reservations, of whom
49 percent are unemployed. The Bureau of Indian Affairs estimates
that at least half the American Indian population lives in poverty.
Soldierwolf said all but one of his adult children were unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can make it to the end of the month, you're all
right,'' Soldierwolf said, referring to the monthly food stamps.
``It's worse than in the Depression.'' Mrs. Soldierwolf nodded,
with tears in her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The Wyoming Department of Family Services says the Northern
Arapaho on the reservation account for 18.9 percent of all welfare
cases in Wyoming. The reservation population of 12,000 _ including
6,000 Northern Arapaho tribal members, about 3,000 Shoshone tribal
members and 3,000 from other tribes _ represents about 2.5 percent
of the state's population of 480,000.
</P>
<P>
   Revere and Ms. Houser say the community garden can help reduce
dependence on welfare by enabling residents to produce cash crops,
traditional Indian plants to be sold on or off the reservation.

<P>
   On the Crow Reservation in Montana, at a five-acre garden to be
planted this fall, the plan is to let people's work part at the
garden count toward fulfillment of their welfare community service
requirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to provide people with skills that they can use
here or take with them,'' said Charlene Johnson, a Crow tribal
member and nutritionist with Indian Health Services. ``Indians are
not horticulturists. They were hunters and gatherers who were
forced to garden when they were put on the reservations. There is a
lack of knowledge about how to plant and water crops.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ethete (pronounced EE-tha-tee), the school is adding
horticulture to its natural science curriculum, and students take
field trips to the community garden for hands-on experience growing
their own food.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Lujan, a father of four, used seeds Ms. Houser gave him
to grow ceremonial Indian corn in a little garden on the side of
his house. ``I will give this corn to anyone who wants some,
because it is part of our religion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lujan, an Arapaho tribal member, said he would use all parts of
the corn, including the husk to wrap tamales he plans to make the
staple of a catering business he is starting. He is also growing
pumpkins, onions and cucumbers. ``I'm pretty sure we're going to
save a lot of money this year with what we've grown,'' he said. &QL;

UTAH STRUGGLES WITH A REVIVAL OF POLYGAMY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ As this state rebuilds highways and hotels to
play host to the 2002 Winter Olympics, modern Utah is wrestling
with a social institution inherited from its 19th-century Mormon
pioneers _ polygamy.
</P>
<P>
   In this conservative state, ``don't ask, don't tell'' means that
sheriffs and judges turn a blind eye to polygamy, a felony that has
not been prosecuted here in almost half a century.
</P>
<P>
   The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, whose founder
sanctioned polygamy, has excommunicated polygamists for more than a
century. But in the current laissez-faire legal climate, the number
of Utahans living in polygamous families has increased tenfold in
the last 50 years and is now at about 40,000 people, or 2 percent
of the state's population, social scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   In today's open climate, the debate over the practice is led by
two rival groups savvy in the modern ways of Web sites, news
conferences and television talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   Tapestry of Polygamy, a self-help group of former polygamous
wives, says it seeks to ``free'' women and children from polygamy.
The Women's Religious Liberties Union, an association of women
content with their lives in polygamous relationships, seeks to
legalize what it calls ``plural marriage'' and to win a ban on
discrimination against polygamists.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a mini-civil war _ we are going to free
the slaves,'' said Carmen Thompson, the spokeswoman for the
Tapestry group, which is setting up a network of ``safe houses'' to
help women and children escape polygamous households.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Potter, the spokeswoman for the opposing group, retorted:
``Women in my group are happy in their relationships. They don't
want other people to narrow their rights.''
</P>
<P>
   What has fueled the issue of polygamy statewide as well as
nationally is the case of a 16-year-old girl who stumbled into a
remote gas station in northern Utah this summer. Covered with fresh
bruises on her legs, arms and buttocks, authorities said the girl
had run seven miles through the night, fleeing her father's belt
and the future he had ordained for her: marriage to her uncle, and
life as his 15th wife.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager's 911 call has resulted in a charge against her
father, John Daniel Kingston, a leader of a wealthy but secretive
polygamous clan based in a Salt Lake suburb. Rowenna Erickson, a
Tapestry member who left the clan in 1991, said that incest, child
marriage and birth defects were becoming more frequent in the clan,
which numbers about 1,500 people.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Erickson said the value of the clan's ranches and
companies totaled more than $150 million, she asserted that women
and children in the group often lived in poverty, earning minimum
wages from business and receiving food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Erickson said that John Daniel Kingston had fathered 10
children with a half-sister and that the 16-year-old girl who fled
was his eldest child. Identified only by her initials, M.N., she
testified in late July in court here that last fall she had been
secretly married against her will to an uncle, David Kingston.
After she ran away twice, she said, her father drove her 80 miles
north of here to a ranch that the clan uses for disciplining what
it considers wayward women and children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could taste the blood in my nose,'' she testified, recalling
how her father punched her on the drive to the ranch. After taking
her to an old barn, she said, he began whipping her with his belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he was going to give me 10 licks for every wrongdoing.
He said there were three,'' she told the court between sobs.
</P>
<P>
   After being whipped 28 times, she said, she passed out.
</P>
<P>
   Her father was charged with felony child abuse and her uncle
with one count of incest and one of sexual abuse of a minor. The
father, who has pleaded not guilty, is scheduled to go on trial in
October. The charge carries a penalty of one to 15 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The uncle, who appeared in court on Aug. 17, did not enter a
plea. He is scheduled to appear again on Sept. 1. Each count
carries a penalty of up to five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Now 17, the girl lives in a foster home and plans to return to
high school next month. One year ago, she worked as a receptionist
for Carl Kingston, the lawyer who now represents her father. The
lawyer, a cousin of the father and the uncle, did not return
repeated calls to his law office here.

</P>
<P>
   Even though they are not members of the Mormon Church, most
polygamists in Utah call themselves ``Mormon fundamentalists,''
reaching back over 150 years in church history to the early 1840s,
when Joseph Smith, the church founder, sanctioned the practice.
</P>
<P>
   According to his belief, ``true Mormons'' could attain the
highest levels of heaven by conceiving as many children as possible
so that they would bring more souls out of the limbo of
pre-existence.
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th century, polygamy was the pivotal issue that delayed
statehood for the Utah territory for almost half a century after
the first request by Mormon pioneers. Statehood came only in 1896
after Wilford Woodruff, president of the church, formally disavowed
polygamy and after Utah approved a state constitution with the
clause: ``Polygamous or plural marriages are forever prohibited.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the early 1950s, men found to be living in polygamy were
routinely jailed by the state. The last major raid on a polygamous
colony, on the Utah-Arizona border in 1953, backfired in the face
of negative public reaction to photographs of children being torn
from their parents and taken to foster homes.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Utah has largely taken an increasingly tolerant
stance toward polygamy. In 1991, the Utah Supreme Court ruled that
polygamous families were eligible to adopt.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Gov. Michael Leavitt, a Republican, speculated that
polygamy might enjoy protection as a religious freedom. After
protests from women who had left polygamous marriages, the popular
Leavitt quickly amended his stance, saying that ``plural marriage
is wrong, it should stay against the law, and there is no place for
it in modern society.''
</P>
<P>
   In Salt Lake City, easily Utah's most liberal city, support for
prosecuting polygamists is tepid _ 54 percent, according to a poll
of 1,000 area residents this spring, published in The Salt Lake
Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   Polygamy is difficult to prosecute because the men generally
obtain marriage licenses for only their first wives. Subsequent
marriages are performed secretly, and the additional wives often
present themselves to society as single women with children.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the difficulty of proof, Utah Attorney General Jan Graham
announced recently that she had advised prosecutors to avoid
prosecuting cases of consensual adult bigamy, which carry jail
terms of up to five years and fines of up to $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we want polygamy squads looking in windows to see who is
sleeping with whom?'' asked chief Deputy Attorney General Reed
Richards. Referring to what are sexual crimes in Utah that are
committed by consenting adults, he added: ``If you are not making
any effort to prosecute fornication, adultery or gay people
indulging in sodomy, why polygamy?''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Utah officials have reached a consensus to crack down
on crimes that sometimes surround polygamy _ child abuse, statutory
rape, welfare fraud and incest.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Utah Legislature raised the age for statutory
rape to 17 from 16. Next year, the Legislature is expected to raise
the minimum marriage age to 16 from 14.
</P>
<P>
   To the women of Tapestry, male manipulation and exploitation are
the glue of polygamy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you threw out the religion, all of us women realized that
it was made for the benefit of men,'' said Vicky Prunty, who left
two polygamous marriages with a total of six children. ``He would
stay with the other women until I ran and dropped on my knees and
asked forgiveness _ which I did a couple of times.''
</P>
<P>
   Carmen Thompson, who had five children in two polygamous
marriages, agreed, saying: ``He would pit the wives against each
other; as long as there was turmoil, there was more control. He
would come for a sexual favor, saying the other women wouldn't do
it for him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Irwin Altman, a University of Utah psychology professor who
studied 24 ``Mormon fundamentalist'' families, said: ``The
stereotype that men are cynical and just in it for a good time does
not hold up with our data. The man is a nomad. He rotates around.
He doesn't know where his clothes are half the time. For privacy,
some will go into their cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Poverty is often a hallmark of polygamy in this country. The
border towns of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Ariz., targets of
polygamy raids in the 1950s, are now heavily subsidized by federal
and state aid, according to a study of welfare and tax records by
The Salt Lake Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   The two towns, with a total population of about 6,000, rank in
the top 10 in the states in the mountain time zone for receiving
federal aid for poor women and children. With an average household
of 8.5 people, Hildale has the lowest average federal tax return of
any Utah town, $651 for each filer.
</P>
<P>
   With household incomes about half the state average, the Tribune
study found, the two towns have received almost $5 million in
recent years in federal and state aid to build better houses and
sewers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet because of high birth rates and conversions to Mormonism,
polygamy in Utah has rebounded from a low point involving a few
thousand people in the 1950s, Altman said. Recalling that federal
troops and judges tried to eradicate polygamy more than a century
ago, he said of Utah's polygamists, ``They are here to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, four years ago, Wilford Woodruff Steed died in Colorado
City at age 94. He left six wives, 43 children and 235
grandchildren. Steed was born 10 years after his namesake, Wilford
Woodruff, proclaimed the Manifesto _ the first church order to all
Mormons to stop practicing polygamy. &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   The sluggish remnants of Tropical Storm Charley will drift
westward in the vicinity of the Big Bend of Texas Sunday. Though
the winds of Charley will be diminished, the system will still
harbor an impressive reservoir of tropical moisture. Thus, heavy
rains from showers and thunderstorms will threaten south-central
and southwest Texas. Flash flooding is likely.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hurricane Bonnie will strengthen as it churns
relatively slowly northwest near the Bahamas. Though isolated,
routine thunderstorms will develop over eastern Florida. A
compensating area of sinking air preceding the rising air
associated with Hurricane Bonnie will limit storms near Florida's
east coast.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to lethargic tropical systems, a current of
fast-moving air will flow over the northern tier states at
altitudes near 30,000 feet. A series of disturbances will move
eastward with this current, generating clusters of showers and
thunderstorms. One disturbance will spark showers and storms early
Sunday in eastern Michigan and then forge into New York and New
England along and ahead of a warm front.
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of showers and thunderstorms will develop over the
upper Great Lakes and northern Minnesota Sunday afternoon in
response to another disturbance. A few of these storms will
approach severe levels, with strong winds and hail posing a threat.
Clusters of potent storms will also erupt farther southwest into
parts of Iowa and eastern Nebraska along a cool front associated
with the disturbance.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Probing Storms
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane hunters continued to relay crucial information about
Bonnie to forecasters at the National Hurricane Center Saturday.
Though aircraft probing the stormy ring of thunderstorms that
surround the eye of hurricanes have experienced serious turbulence
on occasion, such flights are generally much smoother than flying
into severe thunderstorms over land. The updrafts of air that
sustain ferocious continental storms can reach speeds of 60 miles
an hour or more and can cause severe turbulence. By contrast, the
updrafts in thunderstorms in the eye wall of hurricanes are much
slower.

   It's maybe not going too far out on a limb to say that President
Clinton is worried about his legacy nowadays. But he can take
heart: History has a way of turning black to white, or at least to
a lighter shade of gray.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Richard Nixon was rehabilitated, sort of, wasn't he?
And even the reputation of the nation's most scandal-tarred and
least respected chief executive is on the mend. Yes, to judge from
some new historical accounts, Warren G. Harding is on the comeback
trail.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio Republican, who died in office 75 years ago this month,
has long been cast as a venal, sybaritic, glad-handing boob who
left behind an administration lousy with corruption, epitomized by
the Teapot Dome scandal, in which oil barons bribed his interior
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The sympathetic new portrayals make one or more of three
arguments: The first (not exactly new) is that, as far as graft is
concerned, Harding was mainly a victim of guilt by association with
corrupt appointees _ a common occupational hazard of the White
House that hasn't tarnished other presidents.
</P>
<P>
   The second argument is that Harding's reputation for
extramarital affairs, especially one with Nan Britton, rests on
much shaky evidence and is in any case exaggerated. The third is
that Harding's accomplishments have gotten short shrift thanks to
the fixation on corruption and philandering. Here are excerpts.
</P>
<P>
   _ TOM KUNTZ
</P>
<P>
   In his new book, ``A History of the American People''
(HarperCollins, 1998), the conservative British historian Paul
Johnson contends that the so-called Ohio Gang, a group of Ohioans
selling government favors from a K Street office in Washington,
``had nothing to do with Harding.'' He writes that Harding was
implicated in their misdeeds thanks to ``an exemplary exercise in
false historiography'' after his death from a heart attack in San
Francisco in 1923:
</P>
<P>
   ``It began in 1924 with a series of articles in the New Republic
by its imaginative and violently anti-business editor, Bruce
Bliven. He created the myth that the Ohio Gang, run by ((Harry J.))
Daugherty ((Harding's attorney general)), had deliberately
recruited Harding in 1912 as a front man as part of a long-term
conspiracy to hand over America to Andrew Mellon and Big Business.
It now seems that there was no evidence whatsoever for this
invention, and it is not surprising that Bliven went on, in the
1930s, to become a credulous propagandist for the communist-run
Popular Front.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon came dark intimations about Harding's death, Johnson
writes, and Nan Britton's largely unsupported account of an affair:
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1926, a novel, `Revelry,' describes a guilty president who
poisons himself to escape scandals and exposure. It took in the
disapproving ((Herbert J.)) Hoover ((Harding's commerce secretary
and later president)), who always thought he would have made a
better president than Harding. He read it in manuscript and told a
friend it described `many things which are not known.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The novel's success in turn prompted Nan Britton, an Ohio
girl, daughter of a Marion doctor, to publish in 1927 `The
President's Daughter,' asserting that she had had a baby girl by
Harding in 1919. She claimed that she had been seduced in Harding's
then office in the Senate, and that their affair continued, Harding
writing her many letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even at the time she failed to produce those incriminating
letters. Recent research has established that she was the local
``fast'' girl, whose embarrassing crush on Harding had led to
trouble for the unsuspecting man _ including blackmail _ though it
is likely he was unable to completely resist his `stalker.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The child did exist, but the father may have been one of many
men, and Britton's descriptions of later hotel assignations with
Harding have been disproved by research into hotel registers.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson cites as a source Robert H. Ferrell, a historian at
Indiana University. In ``The Strange Deaths of President Harding''
(University of Missouri, 1996), Ferrell says he found no credible
evidence to support Miss Britton's claim, often repeated as fact,
of trysts with Harding in a White House closet. Rather, Ferrell
cites interviews with White House employees compiled by a Harding
friend, E. Mont Reily:
</P>
<P>
   ``Reily offered the testimony of the doorkeeper at the executive
offices for nearly 35 years, his friend Patrick Kenney, who told
him he `never had heard of Nan Britton, and that he had never
admitted any woman by such a name in to see or meet any president!'
Kenney was certain of the fact. `I keep a record. I remember, and I
know, and I also know that no strange woman ever came here to see
President Warren G. Harding.' In the event that Ms. Britton might
have gone to the White House proper, rather than the executive
offices, there was the testimony of Ike Hoover ((chief White House
usher)), who had come into the mansion during the administration of
President Benjamin Harrison and left at the outset of the Franklin
Roosevelt administration. Reily asked him about Nan Britton, and he
bristled at the notion that she could have entered the executive
mansion. `Nan Britton? No, there was never a gadabout by that name,
or any other name, in the White House. Nan Britton is a liar.'''
</P>
<P>
   Harding was not helped by portrayals like the one presented by
Theodore Roosevelt's daughter, Alice Roosevelt Longworth, who,
Johnson says, resented that Harding made it to the White House
instead of her husband, House Speaker Nicholas Longworth. In a 1933
memoir, she presented the Harding White House as a speakeasy:
</P>
<P>
   ``The air heavy with tobacco smoke, trays with bottles
containing every imaginable brand of whisky stood about, cards and
poker chips ready at hand _ a general atmosphere of waistcoat
unbuttoned, feet on the desk and spittoon alongside. ... Harding
was not a bad man. He was just a slob.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Carl Sferrazza Anthony, a biographer of first ladies, accepts
that in his private life Harding ``fully lives up _ or down _ to
his deeply tarnished reputation.'' But in yet another positive new
portrayal of Harding, he writes in the July/August issue of
American Heritage magazine that he was surprised at what he learned
in researching his latest book, ``Florence Harding'' (William
Morrow, 1998):
</P>
<P>
   ``As I delved further into the Harding archives, I kept finding
evidence of a more positive side to his administration. For
instance, he is rarely credited for his best appointments, like
that of Charles Evans Hughes as Secretary of State, or for
convening the Washington Naval Conference on the limitation of
armaments, the first global peace summit. Nor is he remembered for
creating the Bureau of the Budget, headed by Charles Dawes, which
first gave the federal government an operational budget. Such
high-caliber choices as Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover and
Secretary of Labor James J. Davis certainly counterbalance those of
((Albert)) Fall ((the corrupt interior secretary)) and Daugherty.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony adds that Harding deserves credit for his progressive
views toward blacks and Jews, reflected in his naming Albert Lasker
head of the Shipping Board _ ``the first-ever high-profile
presidential appointment of a Jew.'' In addition, Anthony writes:
</P>
<P>
   ``Tolerance shaped Harding's foreign policy as well. `I am very
glad to express my approval and hearty sympathy for the effort of
the Palestine Foundation Fund, in behalf of the restoration of
Palestine as a homeland for the Jewish people,' the president wrote
to that organization in an unpublished letter that I found in his
papers. `I have always viewed with an interest, which I think is
quite as much practical as sentimental, the proposal for the
rehabilitation of Palestine and the restoration of a real
nationality. ...' This was a significant discovery; no published
works on Harding even hint at his interest in turning Palestine
into a Jewish homeland.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony writes further:
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps the most surprising single event of Harding's
presidency was his blunt speech on Oct. 26, 1921, to a segregated
crowd in Birmingham, Ala., stating that democracy would always be a
sham until African-Americans received full equality in education,
employment and political life. The first president to discuss civil
rights in the South so frankly, he was loudly cheered by blacks and
met with silent stares from whites. ... In Birmingham, Harding went
further than any of his predecessors since Lincoln to call for `an
end to prejudice.'''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson concludes that Harding deserves the sort of reputation
that he enjoyed in his lifetime _ as ``the kind of president
American people of all classes love _ kind, genial, decent,
ordinary, human, one of them.'' Furthermore, he notes:
</P>
<P>
   ``As Thomas Edison put it, `Harding is all right _ any man who
chews tobacco is all right.''' &QL;

ICEHOUSES ARE SLOWLY MELTING INTO THE SOUTH TEXAS PAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RICK LYMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ More often than not, midday finds Clynn Cox sitting on
one of the chipped swivel chairs at the West Alabama Ice House,
nursing a long-neck bottle of iced beer wrapped in a sopping paper
napkin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been coming for 18 years, which isn't so long,'' said
Cox, 66, a retired ironworker. ``Some of the guys have been coming
for 30 years or more. I guess you could say it's kind of a family
around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox, the beer and even a stray dog called Stray, stretched out
on the cool concrete, its fur blown to attention by an
industrial-strength floor fan, are all part of a classic and slowly
disappearing South Texas tableau, the neighborhood icehouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that there may be a handful elsewhere, but you
tend to find the real, classic icehouses in a line from Houston to
San Antonio and then south to the border,'' said Char Miller, a
professor of American history at Trinity University in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   An icehouse is an open-air beer joint, a cross between a saloon
and a convenience store.
</P>
<P>
   One University of Texas historian traced the icehouse as far
back as 1840, when ships in Maine would load their holds with ice,
head down the coast and into the Gulf of Mexico and sell whatever
had not melted when they docked in Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, they sold ice,'' said Jerry Markantonis,
whose family owns and runs the West Alabama Ice House. ``Then in
the 1920s, they began to add some items, like bread or milk or
beer. They became like neighborhood groceries or convenience
stores. But after a while, a lot of them realized that the most
popular item was beer so they did away with everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   It can be difficult to get people in South Texas to agree on
what constitutes an icehouse. ``We don't have a real definition for
an icehouse,'' said Julie Utsey, a spokeswoman for the Texas
Alcoholic Beverage Commission. A lot of places call themselves
icehouses _ there are more than 50 listed under ``tavern'' in the
Houston yellow pages _ that aficionados will tell you are not
actually icehouses, in the classic sense.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Munoz and Geoff Edwards, curators for a traveling exhibit
on ``The South Texas Ice House'' that is scheduled to come to El
Museo del Barrio in New York City in the fall of 1999, describe an
icehouse as ``originally a rural grocery store and cantina which
eventually transformed into a spontaneous form of community
center.''
</P>
<P>
   Some say that the only authentic icehouses have inadequate
parking, because they were built to cater to the neighborhood.
Others say that a true icehouse has no air-conditioning, or will
cool its beer only under mountains of ice. One professor described
it as a drinking establishment where it is difficult to tell
``where the inside ends and the outside begins.''
</P>
<P>
   Markantonis, disdainful of what he sees as a growing number of
beer joints that misuse the name icehouse, has his own definition.
``It must be a place that, at one time, actually sold blocks of
ice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've never really been properly defined,'' said Jesse Hall,
a graduate student at the University of the Incarnate Word in San
Antonio who is making a film about an icehouse for his thesis.
``The few real icehouses, the ones that are still around, are to
their neighborhood what a town center was to a small village.''
</P>
<P>
   The heyday of the icehouse was between the end of World War II
and the late 1960s. It was illegal to sell hard liquor by the drink
in Texas until 1969, which helped sustain the icehouses.
</P>
<P>
   Many icehouses closed in the '70s and '80s, when their
neighborhoods disappeared in the rush of suburbanization. But now,
as Houston and San Antonio join many cities in seeing a fresh wave
of suburbanites moving back into the city centers, icehouses are
endangered by rising real-estate prices and suburban sensibilities.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The values those returning suburbanites have and the values of
the local communities are quite different,'' Miller said. ``What
you see is this culture clash. It's classic. In the end, though, as
these longstanding communities fade, so will the institutions
associated with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people agree that an icehouse is open to the air, usually
with outside tables and overhangs, though it often has garage-like
doors that can be closed during the coldest winter evenings when
the temperatures can dip into the 40s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really emerged out of mom-and-pop operations very closely
tied to discrete neighborhoods, serving largely working-class
populations,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   In San Antonio, icehouses tend to draw Hispanic customers. In
Houston and East Texas, more customers tend to be white tradesmen
and oil workers. Some, like the West Alabama Ice House, draw a
diverse group from construction workers to downtown office workers
with cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very plastic forms, that's what they are,'' said Tom
Denyer, a former professor of political science at Texas A &AMP; M who
has written academic articles on the icehouse phenomenon. ``They're
folk venues. They're collaborations between the owner and the
regulars. They're ongoing performance art.''
</P>
<P>
   Pete Markantonis, 30, the son of Jerry Markantonis and the
manager of the West Alabama Ice House, dumped a bucket of ice cubes
into stainless steel tubs filled with long-neck beers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you of two icehouses that were put out of business
in recent years by neighborhoods who thought they were too loud or
rowdy,'' he said. ``There's no doubt the neighborhood is changing,
but we've been lucky to have support from our community. A real
icehouse is a family place, and that's what we try to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, several young children, including his own, were
running around nearby.
</P>
<P>
   He reached in and pulled out a cold bottle and wrapped it in a
paper napkin, which instantly clung to the wet sides. There is a
deeply held belief among icehouse aficionados that, just as beer in
a bottle tastes better than beer in a can, so does beer kept in ice
taste better than refrigerated beer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's true,'' Cox said. ``I think maybe it's
psychological. Though there's just something about it when you pick
up a beer that's been in ice, the way it feels in your hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox tries to remember back to his first visit, when he had just
moved to the neighborhood and thought the icehouse looked like a
nice place. Had it changed much?
</P>
<P>
   ``Change?'' he said, momentarily puzzled. ``It doesn't change
much around here. That's why we come.'' &QL;

CALIFORNIA ACTS TO BAR GAG ORDERS IN AUTO DEFECT CASES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ak) 
 By ANDREA ADELSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ California motorists who obtain restitution from
automakers for defective vehicles may no longer have to promise
they will stay quiet as part of their settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation approved by California lawmakers would bar
automakers from imposing gag rules in agreements to repurchase cars
or trucks that are deemed defective under the state's lemon law.
The bill, the first of its kind in the nation, awaits the signature
of Gov. Pete Wilson; an aide said Wilson was likely to sign it.
</P>
<P>
   Demands for silence on the settlement terms of a court case, or
on details of a matter resolved privately, are common in disputes
involving medical malpractice, product liability and corporate
malfeasance. Increasingly, consumer advocates say, these secrecy
clauses are being written into automakers' agreements to buy back
badly flawed vehicles. Some regulators say the gags erode their
oversight by making it hard for them to track vehicles that have
been branded as lemons.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler Corp.'s reselling of 116 such defective vehicles is
central to a two-year legal fight between the company and
California's Department of Motor Vehicles. In June, a Superior
Court judge ordered the dispute to be reconsidered, and, in effect,
reinstated the proposed penalty _ the harshest by any state for
violations of lemon laws. The penalty, which has yet to take
effect, would bar Chrysler from shipping cars or trucks to the
state for 45 days. Chrysler has denied wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Annually, about 100,000 vehicles are repurchased by automakers
because of defects, including 5,000 to 10,000 in California, said
Clarence Ditlow, director of the Center for Auto Safety in
Washington. He said consumer complaints often prompted
investigations by Federal safety officials. ``If the gags are
widespread, you're going to dry up the source of complaints,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Charles M. Calderon, a Democrat who co-sponsored the
bill with Democratic Assemblyman Kevin Shelley, said he expected
Wilson to approve the legislation. ``Where the state has a
responsibility to monitor safe products, then secrecy makes no
sense,'' Calderon said.
</P>
<P>
   In a Senate hearing in June, Mark Krause, a lobbyist for defense
lawyers, testified that the legislation would generate more
litigation and work against consumers, making automakers less
likely to negotiate. ``By having a gag clause, it sweetens the
pot,'' he said. ``It makes it easier for manufacturers to settle.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rosemary Shahan, president of Consumers for Auto Reliability
and Safety, an advocacy group in Sacramento that asked lawmakers to
introduce the bill, argued that ``gag clauses interfere with
agencies that are supposed to protect us.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the state Senate voted 21-12 to approve the
legislation, adding an amendment that permits secrecy on a
settlement's financial terms. On Tuesday, the state Assembly, which
had endorsed the bill, approved the amendment 42-28.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In addition to the Association for California Tort Reform,
several automakers opposed the legislation. Ray Buttacavoli,
regional manager for General Motors Corp. in Sacramento, said most
lemon-law repurchases were voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we ought to be able to impose conditions on those
buybacks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Gomez, 48, a Moorpark, Calif., avocado grower, felt
vindicated when arbitrators deemed her 1996 Jeep Cherokee a lemon.
In its first year on the road, the car's drive shaft fell out
twice, once when Ms. Gomez's teen-age son was driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we returned the car, the very first thing they did was
shove a gag order in our face,'' Ms. Gomez said. ``It was
intimidation without legal representation; it was a threat to drag
it out.''
</P>
<P>
   A Chrysler representative eventually released a check to Ms.
Gomez, but only after she declared her intention to seek the help
of a consumer advocate.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gomez's experience is typical, said Steven Solomon, a
Burlingame, Calif., lawyer who specializes in vehicle fraud. Most
consumers see a gag provision only in the final flurry of paper
signing, not in negotiations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates say they hope that California's ban on gag
clauses will be copied in other states. Yet the bill does not
establish a broader precedent that could be used to argue against
gag clauses in other consumer product settlements, said Judge
Thomas J. Whelan, presiding judge of San Diego Superior Court.
``The statute is limited in its application,'' he said.

   JAMAICA-WHIZKID _ KINGSTON, Jamaica _ He swoons over the Spice
Girls. He mouths off to his mother. He even signs his name with a
smiley face. Yet the dreadlocked Makonnen David Blake is a
13-year-old who holds a powerful position: he's the youngest-ever
adviser to the Jamaican government. The fidgety whiz kid was
recently appointed by the government to advise the Ministry of
Technology on computer technology and new trends in the Internet.
He'll hold the position for at least one year. Thrown out of school
at age 7 for questioning whether Jesus was really white, Blake was
home-schooled in a country where public education is poor. Today,
he reads science textbooks for fun and designs Web sites for his
friends. Wearing Adidas jogging pants and a T-shirt, he has a
direct line to government officials, many of whom just started
using computers over the past year. Government officials say
they're relying on Makonnen to take them into the next century of
computer technology. They say they want to put a computer in every
public school by the year 2000. But many of the 967 schools don't
even have a phone line. Meanwhile, the new government adviser has
an interesting family history. His grandfather, Evan Blake, broke
the color barrier in Jamaica in the 1950s by jumping into a
whites-only swimming pool. (Emling, Cox News Service).

   CHINA-SATELLITES _ WASHINGTON _ Critics of the Clinton White
House have had a field day with the president's 1996 decision to
transfer the jurisdiction of approving commercial satellite exports
from the U.S. State Department to the business-friendly Commerce
Department. Republicans have attacked the transfer, saying Clinton
did so as the result of hefty campaign donations from satellite
makers like Loral Corp. But what is not so well-known is how this
jurisdictional transfer away from the more stringent State, to the
Commerce Department was really a bipartisan affair. In fact,
records obtained by the Cox News Service show that key Republicans
in Congress, including House Speaker Newt Gingrich, were behind the
transfer and advocated on behalf of the satellite makers. ``There
is no doubt that the Republicans were helping us do this just as
much as the Clinton White House,'' said Clayton Maury, head of the
Satellite Industry Association. (Carr, Cox News Service).

footnote in judicial law. When he was sentenced to mandatory five
years in prison on a weapons charge in connection with a drug case
seven years ago, U.S. District Court Judge Walter Rice postponed
imposing the sentence _ indefinitely. The Supreme Court eventually
reversed the case in which Spurgeon was convicted, and now he

   ROBESON _ ROBESON COUNTY, N.C., has emerged from the governance
of white politicians despite a nearly even split of blacks, whites

the first Native American to become sheriff as proof of bonafide
change, and the county school board recently ended a tradition of
rotating its leadership among the races by electing its first woman
_ a white _ instead installing a black. The changes aren't without
growing pains, however. A Superior Court judge recently issued a
gag order in the impending trial of a school superintendent
indicted for embezzlement. The judge is Native American as is the
defendent, raising the question whether political favoritism is at
hand. (Manuel , Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

has become a household name in Mississippi. She filed an initiative
in June that would put the issue of riverboat casinos to a
statewide vote, giving Mississippians a chance to kick the casinos
out. If they vote to ban gambling, the 30 riverboats docked in
eight counties along the Mississippi River and the Gulf Coast would

Roebuck store on the edge of this college town, Catawba Bingo
offers games every day except Sunday, luring thousands of folks
from all over the Southeast. On Big Games days, twice each month,
the payout is $200,000 with one game worth $50,000. Folks arrive as
early as 10 a.m. for the start of the 1 p.m. games. ``We're doing
quite well,'' said Wanda George Warren, the Catawba Indian Nation's
executive director. (Riddle, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   WASHINGTON _ It's not easy being in love with a president.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many distractions. Whenever you want a little
quality time, he's got some world crisis to handle.
</P>
<P>
   I remember reading an interview with Judith Exner, where she
talked about how lonely it was dating JFK. Whenever she wanted him
to focus on her, he was focusing on Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba, Cuba, Cuba! That's all he cared about.
</P>
<P>
   So I felt for Monica Lewinsky when she appeared before the grand
jury on Thursday _ still pining for some attention from her
ex-boyfriend _ and he was caught up in macho commander in chief
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan, Sudan, Sudan! That's all he cared about. And he wasn't
even wearing one of her secret love ties.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old says she is eager to get on with her life. But
does she still dream that her life will include an ex-president
named Bill?
</P>
<P>
   I just hope she is not over at the Watergate, flipping through
designer swatches for the Clinton Presidential Library.
</P>
<P>
   After the president's prime-time confession, the news media were
abuzz about whether Clinton could repair his damaged relationships
with his wife and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, That Woman stamped her feet. Like the Glenn Close
character in ``Fatal Attraction,'' Monica Lewinsky issued a
chilling ultimatum to the man who jilted her: I will not be
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   She let it be known that she was wounded that the president had
failed to apologize to her and had dismissed their grand, 18-month
romance, their shared passion for books and laughs, as trivial _ a
mere mechanism for relieving Oval Office tension.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton rejected a more contrite version of the speech written
by Bob Shrum _ nicknamed the ``Shoot Me'' draft at the White House
_ that contained an apology to ``Monica Lewinsky and her family.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, with some brass-knuckle guidance from Hillary, he
embraced his wife and daughter as ``the two people I love most,''
while swatting Monica away as ``inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   He portrayed himself, insultingly, as a passive participant in
their trysts. What she called true love, he called ``legally
accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Monica got cranky and complained about all the positive press
and public sympathy heaped on her rival, Saint Hillary, while she
was being portrayed as a vixen.
</P>
<P>
   She had lied to protect her beloved. And she had believed, from
hints he had dropped, that there might not be a Hillary in their
future.
</P>
<P>
   More in anger than hope, Monica returned to the grand jury and
made it clear she was not simply servicing the president. The
pleasuring, she insisted, contradicting his account, was mutual.
Their relationship was not cheap. It was way unique.
</P>
<P>
   The romance that rocked the White House seems so pathetically
adolescent. Him, clinging to some juvenile belief that oral sex is
not sex. Her, clinging to some juvenile belief that the president
loved her.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe that this ``feminist'' president didn't
see, or chose to overlook, the misogynistic and narcissistic nature
of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Before the president finally fessed up, his underlings had
whispered that Monica was a stalker who had fantasized a romance
with him.
</P>
<P>
   While she is not a stalker, since Clinton encouraged her
interest for quite some time, she is certainly aggressive.
Otherwise, as a mere intern, she could not have barged through all
the protective layers around the president. And she was, according
to the Tripp tapes, desperate to continue the relationship after
the president had slithered away. I will not be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Monica has at least one special talent: She is relentless. It
was the quality that got her noticed by Bill Clinton, and it is the
quality that will prevent him from ever escaping her.
</P>
<P>
   There is a sort of rough romantic justice here. It may be de
trop to punish this president with impeachment or resignation. In
his case, the punishment is the crime. Monica will never let him
go. She will be center stage for the rest of his presidency, doing
a star turn at congressional hearings, granting celebrity
interviews, signing book and movie deals.
</P>
<P>
   It will not be in the way she envisioned, but she will get to
ride off into the sunset with her man after all. Monica Lewinsky is
Bill Clinton's legacy. They are linked together, forever and ever.
</P>
<P>
   In its own way, it's a perfect ending. &QL;

TALKS ON CONGO GET OFF TO A ROUGH START IN SOUTH AFRICA 
</HEADLINE>
  (js)

<P>
   PRETORIA, South Africa _ A last-ditch effort by South Africa to
negotiate a peace settlement for Congo appeared to get off to a
poor start Saturday, when two of the key players failed to show up
for a scheduled meeting, though one sent a representative.
</P>
<P>
   President Nelson Mandela had called two meetings of African
leaders in Pretoria for this weekend, fearing that the rebellion
and turmoil in the Congo could turn into a regional war. Saturday's
meeting was to gather the leaders of Congo, Rwanda, Uganda and
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda's president, Pasteur Bizimungu, and Uganda's president,
Yoweri Museveni, who are widely believed to be supporting the
rebels, arrived in Pretoria as planned.
</P>
<P>
   But the Congo's president, Laurent Kabila, and his ally,
President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, said they were too ill to
attend, South African officials said. Kabila sent his justice
minister as a representative.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela had planned to negotiate a cease-fire in the Congo and
then map out a strategy for a long-term peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Sunday, he had hoped to present that plan to all 14
countries that are members of the South African Development
Community, hoping they would support it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the absences, South African officials continued to say
they were optimistic about the meetings, which were not expected to
start before mid-afternoon Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we will cover a lot of ground today and tomorrow,''
said Parks Mankahlana, Mandela's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Mankahlana said that efforts were still under way to persuade
Mugabe to come to Pretoria. He said Mandela had asked Mozambique's
president, Joaquim Chissano, to see what he could do to get him to
the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe and Mandela, who have clashed in the past over a range of
issues, have been at odds over how to deal with the Congo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe has been calling for regional military action to prevent
another upheaval in the former Zaire, whose longstanding dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko fell only 15 months ago. Mugabe is reported to
have already sent troops to help prop up Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   But Mandela, currently the chair of SADC, has urged restraint.
Only last week, Mugabe appeared to rebuke Mandela when he said
Mandela could do as he liked, but he shouldn't tell anyone else in
SADC what to do.
</P>
<P>
   South African officials indicated that Kabila's absence came as
no surprise. He has said that he would be reluctant to take part in
any negotiations until a cease-fire had been agreed on.
</P>
<P>
   South African television broadcast a telephone interview with a
Congolese spokesman, Pierre Victor Mpoyo, who said Kabila would
never negotiate with rebels and did not trust Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   Mpoyo said South Africa had sold arms to Rwanda in the past and
was biased in favor of the rebels. Rwanda and Uganda were once
allies of Kabila's, but have since lost patience with him.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa is hoping to map out a framework for a new
government for Congo, which would include a power-sharing scheme
that might address some of Uganda's and Rwanda's concerns. Kabila
has been widely criticized for his lack of leadership and
diplomatic skills. &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In baseball, researchers say that a pitcher standing 60 feet
from home plate needs at least four-tenths of a second to raise his
glove in defense of a hard line drive hit at him.
</P>
<P>
   But on the afternoon of March 23, 1996, Danny Crawford of the
University of Houston was not allowed even that narrow margin. A
Texas A&AMP;M batter hit Crawford with a ball that screamed back in
only 0.29 seconds. Five of his teeth were shattered. Sixty-two
stitches were needed to mend his face.
</P>
<P>
   The bat used that day was an aluminum alloy, space-age
technology that has come to dominate and alter the nature of
amateur baseball in the United States by being simply too good.
</P>
<P>
   The bats are far lighter to swing than wood and the ball flies
off faster. Earlier this month, the National Collegiate Athletic
Association said the newest generation of these bats had become
dangerous to players and harmful to the game because so many
hitting records are being broken.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA ordered bat manufacturers to modify their designs to
meet a new lower-performance standard: bats that are heavier, with
a smaller barrel. The group that regulates high school sports said
it was considering a similar move.
</P>
<P>
   But the rule change, which will take effect next August, has
also brought to the surface an issue that has been churning
bitterly for years within the NCAA and the sports equipment
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Although injuries like Crawford's are still the exception rather
than the rule, officials of the NCAA expressed safety concerns
about the nonwooden bats as early as 1985, and twice, in 1988 and
1995, issued industry guidelines and tests to try to put limits on
bat performance, according to NCAA documents.
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelming those worries, however, were entrenched forces as
old as sports and capitalism: players and teams who were competing
for victories wanted the hitting power afforded by more advanced
alloy bats. Companies, competing with one another for sales, wanted
to supply what the market demanded. A former bat designer who
voiced fears about bat safety with his employer said he was ignored
as the business boomed.
</P>
<P>
   The result was an arms race, with the NCAA, because of its own
flawed science and limited efforts at oversight, ultimately
rendered not much more than a bystander. No team or player or
company wanted to give up any possible advantage, and no one wanted
to be the first to apply the brakes.
</P>
<P>
   Even as officials within the NCAA and within the industry began
to worry, bats evolved to include things that would have made Babe
Ruth's eyes glaze over: hollow air chambers, cryogenic freezing
techniques and rare metal compounds like scandium, which is mined
only in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   Prices soared to $300 a bat. Three companies came to dominate
sales: Easton Sports of Van Nuys, Calif., Hillerich &AMP; Bradsby Co.,
and Worth Inc. of Tullahoma, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is free enterprise and the consumer tells you what he
wants,'' said Bill Williams, the vice president of Hillerich &AMP;
Bradsby, based in Louisville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Aluminum bats started out as substitutes, not stars. Their
appeal when they were introduced in the mid-1970s was their lower
cost and greater durability. They were cheaper than the white ash
for wood bats, and for amateur teams and recreational players, that
filled a need.
</P>
<P>
   But as their appeal grew _ aluminum now accounts for roughly 90
percent of the $115 million bat market, according to the Sporting
Goods Manufacturing Association _ performance began to improve as
well. Major League and Minor League baseball are about the last
leagues left, industry officials say, that allow only wood bats.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, NCAA officials, meeting with manufacturers, made the
first attempt to set limits on the technology. The NCAA ruled then
that Easton's B-9 Black Magic aluminum bat _ then the
highest-performance end of the alloy spectrum _ would be the
benchmark. Future bat models would have to fall within or below the
performance range of the B-9.
</P>
<P>
   But the race to build a better bat continued and batting records
toppled. In 1995, bat manufacturers introduced bats made with yet
another new aluminum alloy, called C405. Strong sales of the new
bats, coupled with a record number of home runs in the 1995 College
World Series, prompted the NCAA to demand yet another meeting with
the bat companies.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings led to the adoption of the so-called bat
performance factor test, aimed at limiting bats to 1994 performance
levels. Created by Richard Brandt, a physics professor at New York
University, the test consisted of firing pitches at 60 mph at a
stationary bat, and concluded that the newer models were not
dramatically more powerful than their predecessors, and not all
that much better than wood.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the legitimacy of the Brandt test began to
accumulate, though, and with them more worries about safety and the
integrity of the game. In a letter last year to Bill Rowe, the
chairman of the NCAA baseball rules committee, Brandt conceded that
his test was more accurate at the lower ball speeds of softball
than at collegiate-level baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the NCAA said they trusted bat manufacturers to
abide by the rules and trusted the standards and tests that
measured bat performance. Now there is a quiet rumbling within
collegiate baseball _ from coaches and officials speaking on
condition of anonymity _ that they feel the rules were bent. On the
record, NCAA spokesmen say simply that neither the NCAA nor the
manufacturers had enough information about what the new
technologies could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we knew then what we know now, we would not have moved
ahead,'' said Ted Breidenthal, staff liaison to the baseball rules
committee at the NCAA, referring to the now discredited tests
adopted by the NCAA in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Sports Equipment Manufacturers Association, a
trade group, said they believed that alloy bats are safe and that
other changes in the game _ a spongier ball and more powerful,
better-conditioned athletes _ helped explain harder-hit balls and
scoring records.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NCAA's own statistics show that baseball is the safest
sport they have,'' said John Riddle, the group's president. ``I
don't think there is a legitimate safety concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers say that the rules, necessary or not, will result
in warehouses full of unsellable bats. Easton, the largest
manufacturer of nonwooden bats, filed a federal lawsuit against the
NCAA even before the rules were voted on, saying that the
organization, which had planned to implement the new rules next
January, was acting precipitously and restraining trade.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA admits that it cannot directly blame alloy bats for
specific injuries because with all the variables involved in a
pitch and a swing, the ball's speed off the bat is only part of the
story. Higher scoring records, however, and studies testing human
reaction time, NCAA officials said, all point to the need for new
limits.
</P>
<P>
   The new specifications require, in particular, that the exit
velocity of a ball leaving a bat be reduced by more than 10
percent, to a maximum of only 93 mph _ comparable to a wood bat _
from the now-common speeds of more than 104 mph. To reach that
threshold, the maximum diameter of the barrel of aluminum bats must
be reduced by one-eighth of an inch and the weight increased.
</P>
<P>
   One bat design expert, Jack MacKay, said the changes were long
overdue. MacKay said he had raised safety concerns to his employer,
Hillerich &AMP; Bradsby, in company memos as far back as 1994 as the
bat wars raged on.
</P>
<P>
   He said flatly in an interview that the NCAA was duped by
companies that knew their bats were more powerful than the tests
indicated.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay, who resigned last year when he said he was being
ignored, is being sued by his former employer for misappropriation
of proprietary information and breach of contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NCAA did nothing wrong except trust the wrong people,''
MacKay said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, the vice president at Hillerich &AMP; Bradsby, said he was
never made aware of MacKay's concerns, and that the company did
nothing improper.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are aware that if we produced anything illegal, it would
not be good for two reasons,'' he said. ``No. 1, it would produce
liability. No. 2, we'd get caught and pay the price. Why would we
hang ourselves like that?''
</P>
<P>
   The debate continues on whether high-performance bats are
hurting the integrity of the game. In NCAA Division I competition,
teams hit an average of 1.06 home runs a game last season, up from
0.70 in 1995. This year's College World Series championship between
the University of Southern California and Arizona State yielded a
21-14 game, a record for runs scored. The record for home runs in a
College World Series was broken in 1995 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm against aluminum mainly because I think it's hurting
baseball,'' said Bob Seddon, the baseball coach at the University
of Pennsylvania. ``It's gotten ridiculous. I was at the College
World Series this year and I got up and left. I mean, what is
this?''
</P>
<P>
   Not all coaches share that sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game is in good balance and the competition level is
fine,'' said Skip Bertman, head coach at Louisiana State
University, which has won four national titles in the last seven
years. ``The game is more popular today than at any point in
history.''
</P>
<P>
   And some scientists say they think the NCAA has perhaps still
not found a reliable solution to its bat problems. One scientist,
Trey Crisco, the director of Rhode Island Hospital's bioengineering
laboratory, who has been commissioned by the NCAA and the National
Federation of State High School Associations to test bats, said
that because the bat makers, most of them privately owned
companies, are so reluctant to share information about their own
tests or specifications, he thinks the NCAA was forced to form its
new policy without enough information.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you set a philosophy, you have to base it on science, not
on emotion,'' Crisco said.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers and distributors who sell sporting goods also say they
expect the pressures to produce a top-selling bat will simply mean
new technological innovations to fit the new standard.
</P>
<P>
   Worth makes a bat, for example, that includes what it calls an
``electronic vibration control module,'' intended to reduce the
so-called ``bee-sting'' on a batter's hands when a ball strikes the
bat and allow a more solid follow-through of the swing.
</P>
<P>
   Another company, Rawlings, has also recently introduced a bat
that features a bigger barrel and a skinny handle that allows a
greater flex and snap of the bat, and thus more power. A spokesman
for Rawlings said the company planned to have a modified version of
that bat _ conforming to the new NCAA standards _ on the market by
early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of possibilities,'' said Jeff Burton, director
of sales at Baseball Express, a San Antonio sports equipment
distributor. ``It will be interesting to see where this leads bat
manufacturing in the future.'' &QL;

GROUP CLAIMS TOLL IN ATTACKS WAS HIGHER THAN FIRST THOUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (ak)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ The number of people killed by American
missiles fired into eastern Afghanistan appears to be higher than
first thought, with one estimate putting the death toll at 50 or
higher.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference here Saturday, the leader of one of the
groups apparently targeted in the attack said ``about 50 of our
people were killed and there is still more counting to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   The leader, Fazal ur-Rehman Khalil, said he is the central emir
of the Harkat-ul-Mujahedeen, one of three militant Islamic groups
that appears to have been targeted.
</P>
<P>
   The official radio of the Taliban, the militant Islamic group
that controls most of Afghanistan, said 21 people died in the
attacks, although it was not clear if that total covered more than
one camp. The United States says it does not yet have an accurate
assessment of the number of people who were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Two other encampments that were hit belonged to the
Jamiat-ul-Mujahedeen and the Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami.
</P>
<P>
   The latter encampment was said to be the home base for Osama bin
Laden, the Saudi businessman U.S. officials say was behind the
bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Reports in the Pakistani press said bin Laden's camp had been
leveled, though, because of either a fortuitous change in dinner
plans or the use of extra caution, he was not present when the
missiles struck.
</P>
<P>
   There was little information about casualties among bin Laden's
followers. The dead and wounded would likely have been taken to
Taliban-run hospitals in Kabul, 90 miles away, or to nearby Khost.
</P>
<P>
   A Pakistani newspaper reported Saturday that bin Laden had
issued a threatening response to the attack that was conveyed by
one of his close associates. The associate, Ayman al-Zawahri,
phoned a Pakistani reporter and said: ``The war has just started.
The Americans should wait for the answer!''
</P>
<P>
   The other two groups hit by the missiles were primarily
Pakistani, and, according to reports here attributed to government
officials, both were active in sending Islamic militants into the
Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Khalil denied any involvement in terrorism.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We are ready to provide all details about the victims, and if
anyone can prove they were terrorists, we will withdraw our
objections and support the American attack,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said his camp and others go back to the war fought in the
1980s against Soviet troops in Afghanistan and the Afghan
government they backed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans themselves built the camps for the purpose of war,
and now we use the buildings as education and welfare centers,''
Khalil said.
</P>
<P>
   Many wounded Pakistanis were being treated at hospitals in their
own country. The dead were taken to their home towns. Survivors
told of their horror as the missiles rained from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were blasts as the bombs fell to the ground,'' said
Mohammed Arsalan, 20, a member of the Harkat-ul-Mujahedeen. ``We
ran to save ourselves, trying to hide in mountains and caves.''
</P>
<P>
   At a religious school of the Harkat-ul-Mujahedeen in the old
city of Rawalpindi, the mood was mournful and deeply anti-American.
Arsalan's elders stopped him from providing a more detailed account
of the missile barrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans have nothing to do with humanity,'' one of the
elders said, shooing Arsalan away. ``The American people have
awakened the Islamic world from slumber because America has
attacked Islam and Islam will have its revenge.'' &QL;

<P>
   Nevada Senate Race Is Gaining Importance
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the U.S. Senate race in Nevada has been rated
``one to watch'' because of the potential vulnerability of the
two-term Democratic incumbent, Sen. Harry Reid. But if recent polls
are on the mark, the contest might well be upgraded to ``one of the
most important to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   The surveys indicate that Reid leads his Republican challenger,
Rep. John Ensign, by only five percentage points or so. Perhaps
more politically portentous, the senator's ``negatives'' in the
polls are rising more rapidly than the representative's.
</P>
<P>
   As political pros see the race, Democratic leaders in the Senate
should not yet bank on Reid to help them hold the line against
Republican gains this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Ensign is unusually well positioned to fight it out with Reid on
Nevada's key political battleground, Las Vegas, which is where the
votes and the dollars are in an otherwise mostly empty state. He
hails from the city.
</P>
<P>
   Ensign is a conservative Republican, but not so conservative
that he cannot go after some of the moderate Las Vegas Democrats
who have been critical to Reid's election successes. And as for Las
Vegas money, particularly the big casino-industry money, Ensign's
family is in the gambling business.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada has about as many Democrats as Republicans, and that
balance is adding to the tightness of the Reid-Ensign contest. In
the latest effort to break the race open, both camps, and the
national political parties, have begun spending heavily on
television advertising, so heavily that the race may end up being
the most expensive waged in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than address issues substantively, many of the ads are
negative almost to the point of being mean-spirited.
</P>
<P>
   A soundbite from an Ensign ad:
</P>
<P>
   ``That old card shark Harry Reid sure talks a good game. Call
that card shark Harry Reid. Tell him on taxes and negative ads ...
start dealing straight.''

   A quotation from a Reid ad:

   ``Beware. Be careful, Congressman Ensign. This sleazy commercial
can come back and bite you.''

<P>
   Money Speaks Louder Than Gov. Bush
</P>
<P>
   The polls indicate that Gov. George W. Bush of Texas is the
early favorite among Republicans to be the Republican nominee in
the 2000 presidential contest. But the governor says the only thing
he's running for at this point is re-election.
</P>
<P>
   As if to underscore that contention and lower his political
profile, Bush recently has been noticeably absent from some big
national Republican gatherings and was a no-show at the annual
National Governor's Conference in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   But follow the money . ...
</P>
<P>
   The latest campaign-finance report from the Bush camp shows that
between March 1 and June 30, he raised $4.4 million, with just
under half of it _ $1.9 million _ coming from beyond the Lone Star
State.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of big out-of-state companies and big people have major
business interests in Texas and would like to see the former
president's son win a second term. But those same companies and
people also like to hedge their presidential bets.
</P>
<P>
   More than $500,000 of the out-of-state money collected by Bush
in the spring came from California, always a cash cow in
presidential elections. That kind of generosity for a Texan could
hardly please California's governor, Pete Wilson, who has been
talking about running again for president _ if he can raise the
cash.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also received almost $300,000 last spring from Washington.
Many of the capital's big-name lobbyists and lawyers have big
interests in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   How did Bush's Democratic challenger, Garry Mauro, fare in the
spring cash contest? He got $54,475 from the Washington lawyers and
lobbyists and $15,175 from California, with all but $175 of the
California money coming from the musician Don Henley of the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   Fordice Changes Tune on Right to Privacy
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years back, Gov. Kirk Fordice of Mississippi was
seriously injured in a car wreck while traveling from Memphis,
Tenn., to Jackson, Miss. He recovered, but questions about the
crash and circumstances leading to it plagued him and were kept
alive in the press and on talk shows, long after he returned to
work.
</P>
<P>
   Area papers reported that at the time of the crash, the
governor, a Republican, was not accompanied by his usual state
police escort. The reports said that a few hours before the crash,
he was seen holding hands and sipping wine in a Memphis-area
restaurant with a woman who was not his wife. Mrs. Fordice, the
reports noted, was in France that day, representing the governor
and the state on a cultural mission.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the reports were correct, Fordice said in several
statements and interviews that there was nothing to say because he
could remember nothing about the accident. Anyway, he insisted, his
private life should not be subject to scrutiny by reporters or
anybody else.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, commenting on President Clinton's speech the night
before about the Lewinsky investigation, the governor said at a
gathering of Mississippi Republicans in Jackson that one of the
burdens of public office was intense scrutiny about public and
private matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``When folks enter public office,'' he said, ``they're due all
the scrutiny they get.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the president, he went on, that scrutiny had made
clear that Clinton was no longer fit to hold office. Then he added:
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing for the country, I think without question, is
his resignation. We now know he's a liar. Other horrors much worse
are to follow and impeachment will surely follow and the United
States doesn't need that.''
</P>
<P>
   Political Calendar
</P>
<P>
   Alaska and Oklahoma will hold primaries on Tuesday.

CANDIDATES BANKROLL DEMOCRATIC ORGANIZATIONS, RIVALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Democratic chieftains in the Buffalo, N.Y., area have a new
patron this year, a well-to-do Manhattan resident named Eliot
Spitzer who has ladled more than $50,000 of his personal wealth
into the local party machine, paying for rent and salaries and
assorted political sundries.
</P>
<P>
   While such largess from an outsider might seem odd, Spitzer is
getting something as well: grass-roots support in his bid for the
Democratic nomination for attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer is a former state prosecutor and real estate heir who
has spent more than $2.5 million of his fortune on his campaign,
and plans to lay out another $1 million before the primary on Sept.
15. But not all of that money has gone to finance cannonades of
television commercials. Spitzer, who has never held elective
office, has also quietly sought to bolster his candidacy by giving
heavily to Democratic organizations and candidates across the
state.
</P>
<P>
   His donations have helped garner him the kind of fealty from
party cadres that more seasoned politicians secure by rising
through the ranks. Often, he has opened his checkbook in the weeks
after local leaders agreed to back him.
</P>
<P>
   He is not the only one to adopt such tactics. Lt. Gov. Betsy
McCaughey Ross, who is seeking the Democratic gubernatorial
nomination and similarly lacks roots in the party, has also done
so. Her campaign and her husband gave a total of $87,000 to the
Democrats in Nassau County in June, less than two months after the
county leader switched his support to Ms. McCaughey Ross.
</P>
<P>
   Their rivals call this spending a cynical and possibly illegal
scheme to buy allegiance, but Spitzer and Ms. McCaughey Ross
strongly deny that they donated in exchange for support.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the arguments about potential improprieties, such
giving demonstrates how affluent candidates benefit from their
bankrolls. They are not only freed from time-consuming fund-raising
and able to spend handsomely on advertising, but can also court
local party organizations that are forever seeking money.
</P>
<P>
   Winning the loyalty of these committees and clubs could be
significant in the primary next month, when turnout will probably
be low, handing an edge to those candidates who can get their
partisans to the polls. Buffalo and surrounding Erie County, as
well as Nassau County, are important battlegrounds in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCaughey Ross, a former Republican who abandoned her party
last year to try to oust her former running mate, Gov. George
Pataki, is using money from her husband, Wilbur Ross Jr., for her
campaign. He has filled her bank account with more than $3 million,
though questions remain about how much of that he will allow to be
spent. Only one of her three rivals, Peter Vallone, the City
Council speaker, has a similar amount on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's money comes from his father, Bernard, a real estate
magnate in New York City. He has raised and spent far more than the
three other contenders _ State Sen. Catherine Abate, Evan Davis, a
counsel to former Gov. Mario Cuomo, and G. Oliver Koppell, who was
attorney general in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Spitzer, his parents and his campaign have made well
over 100 payments in the last two years to Democratic groups and
candidates, according to disclosure records, interviews and a
summary that Spitzer was asked to provide. They range from $25 to
$20,000 and are expected to total more than $300,000 by primary
day.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer adopted the Democratic organization in Brooklyn earlier
this year soon after it lined up behind his candidacy, and he plans
to funnel it more than $60,000. The organization in Nassau has
received more than $15,000 from Spitzer and his father, most of it
around the time that it decided to back him. And Spitzer gave
$15,000 to the Democratic organization in the Rochester area in
January, just as its leader supported him, records show.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her support for the Nassau organization, Ms.
McCaughey Ross has also channeled several thousand dollars to the
one in the Buffalo area.
</P>
<P>
   In separate interviews, Spitzer and Ms. McCaughey Ross defended
their donations, saying they were intended to bolster local
Democratic apparatuses that have withered since Pataki won in 1994.
Both said some of the money was being used for get-out-the-vote
drives and other efforts that would assist their candidacies.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said that after he came in fourth in the primary for
attorney general in 1994, he realized that his campaign had
suffered because he had neglected local Democratic groups, so he
embarked on a strenuous effort to travel around the state and make
his face and platform known.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he attended the typical regimen of fund-raisers and
party dinners, where he gave money, he said. He noted that in
several instances, he had given large contributions _ $5,000, for
example, to the organization in Schenectady County _ to groups that
were not supporting him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contributing money is not a way of generating support or
endearing myself,'' he said. ``I will walk away from anybody who
says a contribution will help get support. I have a very strong
sense of what is ethically correct. I am of the view that after
somebody has supported me, if we are working together, and I am
trying to build a field organization, then I will build that
organization. But I will never contribute money in return for
support.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCaughey Ross said there was nothing unusual about the
donations her campaign and her husband made to the Nassau
Democrats. ``Virtually every statewide candidate has made
contributions to county committees,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Told that her three opponents had not given contributions
anywhere near in size to the Nassau ones, she said she and her
husband were doing their part for the Democrats. ``Wilbur and I are
committed to helping rebuild the Democratic Party in New York
state,'' she said. ``It has no money and it has lacked the kind of
leadership that will make it a financially strong party.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates have come under intense attacks over their
finances. In the attorney general race, Davis angrily withdrew from
the Democratic State Convention in May after contending that
Spitzer's money was turning the process into a sham. Koppell has
filed a lawsuit against Spitzer, asserting that he has violated
state law by receiving financial assistance from his father that is
greater than the legal limit. Spitzer called Koppell's charges
``completely meritless.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abate said she was considering filing a complaint with the
state Board of Elections that would contend, among other things,
that Spitzer should not be allowed to donate money to local
Democratic groups from his personal funds, as he has done, because
such giving is essentially a campaign expenditure that should come
from his campaign. She noted that donations from his personal funds
are much harder to track, because he does not have to detail them
in disclosure forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unseemly to give money at the same time that you are
asking for support,'' Ms. Abate said. ``I believe that credible
candidates who have a record built on the experience of serving the
people shouldn't have to resort to giving money away in the fashion
that he has done.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abate's aides have also maintained that under state law,
county political committees are not allowed to help candidates in
primaries, questioning whether Spitzer's donations are being used
specifically for that purpose. It often appears, though, that the
county leaders who are backing Spitzer are using other groups,
rather than the formal county committees themselves, to handle his
donations.
</P>
<P>
   In the gubernatorial primary, one of the contenders, James
Larocca, has filed a complaint with the Board of Elections over the
payments to the Nassau County organizations by the McCaughey Ross
campaign and Ross. The Nassau leader, Stephen Sabbeth, had been
supporting Larocca, a former state transportation commissioner,
until he shifted to Ms. McCaughey Ross shortly before the state
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that this is a direct violation of the law, and
certainly the spirit of the law, which is that our elections should
not be for sale,'' Larocca said. Larocca quoted Sabbeth as telling
him that the switch stemmed from ```one thing, and one thing only:
money.
</P>
<P>
   ```She has it, and you don't.'''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Sabbeth, who is also allied with Spitzer, said
neither candidate gave donations in return for support.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Larocca's recollection of their conversation,
Sabbeth said: ``It wasn't a quid pro quo. If someone has the
ability after the fact to help us, they are really helping
themselves. That is a responsibility that candidates should have,
if only for the fact that we have an organization in November to
pull out the vote for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The leader in the Buffalo area, G. Steven Pigeon, said he liked
Spitzer in part because the candidate was committed to having a
strong field operation in place for the primary and general
election. Pigeon said the donations were not a decisive factor in
winning support, but he acknowledged that Spitzer's candidacy was
attractive because he has enough money to take on the Republicans,
who have been far more successful at fund-raising than the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going to apologize that we have a candidate who can
compete with them,'' Pigeon said.

 ANOTHER WEEK WITHOUT TAX ON CLOTHING 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MIKE ALLEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pressing a political point and catering to
back-to-school shoppers, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced Saturday
that most clothing or shoes sold in New York City would be free of
sales tax during the first week of September.
</P>
<P>
   The tax, including the state and city levies, totals 8\ percent,
so the weeklong break will mean a savings of $7.42 on a $90 pair of
Nike Air Max running shoes.
</P>
<P>
   This is the fourth such week in the city in two years, as the
mayor continues to push state legislators to do away with the tax.
In the session that ended in June, the state Legislature went part
way, eliminating the tax on clothes and shoes that sell for less
than $110, beginning Dec. 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The week to splurge will be Sept. 1 to 7, when the city's
exemption will cover goods costing less than $500 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best job-creation program that New York has come
up with in probably 50 years,'' Giuliani said. ``The purpose of
encouraging people to shop for clothes during the tax-free week is
to create an example, really, of what can happen if you eliminate
the sales tax.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani praised legislators for meeting him part way, but urged
them to go further. ``When we started three years ago, the cynics
said this couldn't be done in Albany, and we fought and we
scratched and we pushed very hard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some retailers said their sales had tripled during past tax-free
weeks. City officials contend that they more than make up for the
tax money they lose, since more people are hired and shoppers stay
in the city instead of heading for the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   A leading retail analyst, Kurt Barnard, cautioned that part of
the sales increase during tax-free weeks consists of sales that
would have occurred anyway, but are shifted to the taxless periods
because people time their purchases to save money.
</P>
<P>
   But Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report, based
in Upper Montclair, N.J., said tax-free weeks clearly increased
sales over all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brings sales to the city of New York that normally would go
to other areas, and makes it possible for a lot of people on tight
budgets to buy a few more things,'' he said. ``You go in to buy a
suit, and maybe you pick up a tie.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The mayor made the announcement at Moe Ginsburg Men's Better
Clothing, on Fifth Avenue, where he tried on a double-breasted
Italian suit for the benefit of 10 television cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's exactly a suit I could get away with,''
Giuliani said, patting his midriff. Surprise: The suit, carefully
chosen by store executives and the mayor's aides, fit flatteringly.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty nice, huh?'' the mayor said. ``I don't think
I've ever had a suit like this.'' Then he touched the breast pocket
of the $680 suit and said, ``Could you put a little `N.Y.' here, or
something?''
</P>
<P>
   The city, which is promoting the tax break with posters showing
a shiny apple and other classroom cliches, has produced a long list
of items that are eligible for the tax break, and those that are
not.
</P>
<P>
   The exempt items include aerobic clothing, bathing caps, corset
laces, lab coats, riding pants, shoelaces, socks, tights, tuxedos
(unless rented) and underwear.
</P>
<P>
   Taxable items include bobby pins, goggles (unless prescription),
helmets, ice skates, party costumes, roller skates, shin guards,
sunglasses, wallets and wigs.
</P>
<P>
   The store the mayor visited, Moe Ginsburg, has been among the
most aggressive promoters of the city's tax-free weeks, and got a
jump on this fall's campaign by declaring all of August tax free,
with the tax coming out of the store's profit.
</P>
<P>
   The store's president, Paul Ginsburg, said his sales tripled or
quadrupled during past tax-free weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And Arifur Khan, 24, manager of Wheels of London, a shoe store
in Greenwich Village, said his sales increased 10 percent to 20
percent during tax-free weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids browse before tax-free week,'' he said, then come back
and buy.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, several shoppers said they would put off purchases
to take advantage of the tax-free week.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Samuels, 38, who was stocking up on bras for her daughter
at Conway, on 34th Street, said, ``If you really know how to shop,
you don't have to wait around for a no-sales-tax week.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said she would wait until the first week of September
for more expensive items, including gym shoes and blue jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Emily Fanuele, who lives in Greenwich Village and was on her way
out of Gap Kids on Sixth Avenue, said that she would wait to
stretch the $200 she planned to spend on her 7-year-old daughter,
Angeline.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fanuele said she would love to see the sales tax eliminated,
``but I'll take what we can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Gleckman, 46, who has a daughter, Mimi, headed for
nursery school, was suspicious. ``Are they going to mark up the
price?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   During the city's tax-free week last September, shoes were not
covered, which the mayor said ``created mass confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's sales tax includes 4 percent for the city, 4 percent
for the state and one-quarter percent for the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority.
</P>
<P>
   According to estimates by the city's Economic Development
Corporation, the plan passed by the Legislature will mean an
increase of 13,200 retail jobs, while total elimination of the tax
on clothing and shoes would produce 19,600 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sales are often perceived as just marketing, but this is a
genuine discount off the price, and consumers realize that,'' said
Charles Millard, president of the economic development agency.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said eliminating the tax was ``the best way to create
jobs _ not for government to subsidize jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   As the mayor headed out of the fifth floor (``Contemporary
European Collections'') of Moe Ginsburg's on Saturday, he handed
the suit to Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hold on to this,'' Giuliani instructed. ``I'll come back at a
quieter time.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL: MANAGING FLOOD WATERS IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Aug. 23:
</P>
<P>
   This summer's floods on the Yangtze River in central China and
the Songhua River in northeastern China have already left nearly 14
million people homeless, indirectly affected 240 million more and
damaged more than 50 million acres of land. The flood season is not
yet over, but the death toll, estimated at 2,000 by Chinese
authorities, shows that flood management has improved since the
1954 floods that claimed 30,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
   In the past four decades, the government has built extensive
dike systems and created emergency overflow areas to divert water
from densely populated urban centers.
</P>
<P>
   There is now growing concern that maintenance of these
flood-management systems, particularly in the Yangtze region, may
be neglected as the government pours billions of dollars into the
ill-conceived Three Gorges Dam. When completed in 2009, the dam
will create a lake nearly 400 miles long, displace 1.2 million
people and inundate important archaeological sites.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese authorities have long cited flood control on the Yangtze
as a primary justification for the project. The latest floods, they
say, prove the need for the dam. But analysts with the
International Rivers Network, a conservation group, argue that much
of the flooding has taken place in the lower reaches of the
Yangtze, fed by tributaries whose waters would not be controlled by
the Three Gorges project.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the presence of the dam might actually result in worse
flooding disasters in the future. By creating a false sense of
security, the dam could attract more development to flood-prone
areas and lead to reduced investment in downstream dikes. If the
dam failed to control a large flood, the fatalities and economic
loss could be worse than if it had not been built.
</P>
<P>
   After the Mississippi floods in 1993, the U.S. government
rethought its flood-management strategies. Hydrologists and
geologists now consider large dams only marginally useful in flood
control because the reservoirs are typically kept high for power
generation, with only limited capacity to accommodate surging flood
waters.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, many argue that restricting development on
flood-susceptible land, carving out more overflow areas for flood
waters and making buildings flood-resistant are smarter ways to
protect lives and property.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese have been battling floods on the Yangtze for
centuries. A single mammoth dam would probably not have averted the
recent disaster. But its construction could siphon resources from
more effective flood-management strategies.

EDITORIAL: THE PICTURE OF BILL CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Aug. 23:
</P>
<P>
   The sight of Bill Clinton striding into the White House in his
role as commander in chief and the general support for his strike
against terrorism remind us of the power inherent in even a wounded
presidency. It also reminds us, in the case of this particular
presidency, of its missing parts and of what might have been.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's immediate feelings about Clinton can be judged by
the wide gaps between poll questions about his performance and
those about his character. But now, if these last days of summer
allow a breather for the president and the public, there may be
time for deeper ruminations on the issues of trust and privacy in
U.S. politics.
</P>
<P>
   The polls indicate that more Americans trust Monica Lewinsky's
word than Clinton's. Yet no one who voted for him _ or endorsed him
as this page did _ had any illusions about his personal history.
Indeed, everyone assumed that the public ``bimbo eruptions'' were
just part of a much gamier story. Why then should Clinton be blamed
for a failing that was known in advance and is shared by millions
of citizens?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, we suggest, is the American people expect a measure
of self-discipline and dignity from presidents while in office. The
Clintons' performance on ``60 Minutes'' in 1992 certainly
encouraged voters to believe that he would carve out a window of
discretion for the presidential portion of his life. Even his most
tolerant supporters would not have expected reckless behavior in
the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   The plain fact, then, is that although the standards of trust
that Clinton had to meet were not set particularly high, he managed
through persistence to violate them.
</P>
<P>
   Does it follow that by dishonoring himself, Clinton has harmed
trust in the presidency? Presidents Ford, Carter and Reagan, in
their very different ways, demonstrated that not even the grander
failures of Richard Nixon had permanently damaged American respect
for the office.
</P>
<P>
   Equally exaggerated are the speculations that the already
limited privacy rights of the presidency have been ripped apart. It
was, after all, Clinton who opened the door to his world, through
attacks on former lovers, through the use of private detectives and
through refusal to make a pragmatic settlement in the Paula Jones
case.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the ``zone of privacy'' envisioned by Hillary Rodham
Clinton may actually be enlarged for future presidents, simply
because viewing her husband's private life has been as jarring to
adult eyes as getting a glimpse of the mess in an adolescent's
room.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's defenders keep arguing for a suspension of judgment
about his personal failings on the grounds that the presidency is
being damaged as an institution by the powers of independent
counsels and by the erosion of executive privilege.
</P>
<P>
   This White House's advancing of specious claims of executive and
lawyer-client privilege has resulted in court rulings that some
regard as constricting for future chief executives. Between them,
Kenneth Starr and Attorney General Janet Reno have created terrible
publicity for the Independent Counsel Act, putting Congress in the
mood to dump it.
</P>
<P>
   The role of Congress is a key point. Any problems with privilege
or independent counsels can be fixed by legislation and need not
live on as a permanent memorial to the Clinton presidency.
</P>
<P>
   So what will Clinton's memorial be? Part of it will be the
dizzying week in which he became the first president to have to
appear before a grand jury and then, at his political nadir,
launched a bold military strike. His decisiveness illustrated how
quickly a president can rewrite the lead on one day's news story.
</P>
<P>
   The event is also a reminder that fate and fortune may not be
through with this president. But if he goes into history on the
current basis, the picture of Clinton emerging from Marine One and
moving with martial tread across the South Lawn will always be a
sad one. For it will remind us not of how much was accomplished by
Bill Clinton, but of how much was missing within him. &QL;

IRISH, NORTH AND SOUTH, MARK WEEK SINCE TERROR BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAGH, Northern Ireland _ Tens of thousands of people in
Northern Ireland and in the Irish Republic observed a painful
minute of silence at 3:10 Saturday afternoon, the exact time a week
ago that a terrorist bomb killed 28 people in the center of this
small market town.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb, which left 220 injured, 75 of whom are still
hospitalized, was the deadliest terrorist atrocity in 19 years of
sectarian violence in this mostly Protestant British province.
</P>
<P>
   A Catholic splinter guerrilla group, the Real IRA, which wants
the Republic to take over the North, claimed responsibility for the
attack. The police are questioning two men, but no one has been
charged.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted a united Ireland,'' said Amanda Heffernan, a
clerk. ``Now we're united in grief.''
</P>
<P>
   The blast was commemorated in public assemblies in dozens of
cities and towns here and in the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish
Republic. Irish President Mary McAleese spoke briefly. Her father's
pub near the border with the Irish Republic was blown up by
Protestant terrorists 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, who has advanced harsh legal
measures to combat terrorism, attended the ceremony at the
courthouse in Omagh, a few hundred yards from where the bomb went
off. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott represented the British
government.
</P>
<P>
   The Real IRA, which split from the Irish Republican Army this
year, announced a cease-fire last week. And Saturday, another
Republican splinter group, the Irish National Liberation Army,
followed suit, a development officials say should enhance the peace
agreement approved in referendums here and in the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Ahern called the latest cease-fire pledge ``good news at the end
of a bleak and tragic week.''
</P>
<P>
   The Irish National Liberation Army's last admitted violent act
was on June 25 when a car bomb destroyed part of the border town of
Newtownhamilton, wounding 11 people.
</P>
<P>
   The statement _ announced at the west Belfast headquarters of
the group's political representatives, the Irish Republican
Socialist Party _ means that only one anti-British organization in
Northern Ireland, the Continuity IRA, has yet to call a truce. All
major Protestant paramilitary groups have already called
cease-fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that the political situation has changed since
the formation of INLA,'' the statement said. ``We recognize that
armed struggle can never be the only option for revolutionaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the people of the whole island of Ireland ``have
spoken clearly as to their wishes,'' it acknowledged ``faults and
grievous errors in our prosecution of the war.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Innocent people were killed and injured and at times our
actions as a liberation army fell far short of what they should
have been,'' it said. ``For this we as republicans, as socialists
and as revolutionaries offer a sincere and heartfelt apology.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday in Omagh, a mostly Catholic city of 20,000 set in the
cow-studded hills of bucolic central Ulster, the people in the town
center and in nearby parking lots with loudspeakers listened to the
prayers of Protestant and Catholic clergymen. Many wept and many
more seemed to be fighting back tears.
</P>
<P>
   A few directed some of their anger at the Real IRA.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Cunliffe, 68, a retired truck driver and a native
Englishman, said: ``It is disgusting to see what one human being
can do to another. If it was mad dogs, you would put them down.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When the minute of silence began, Kathleen Heffernan picked up
her granddaughter, Tara, 4, hugging and nuzzling her. Half of the
dead in the blast were children.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Heffernan talked about her niece, Stephanie Colton, 16, who
was seriously wounded in the blast.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a piece of the car, the car-bomb car, stuck on her
chest,'' she said. ``She nearly lost a foot. On Tuesday they are
going to try to take the stones out from around her eyes, the
gravel that the bomb blew at her.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Heffernan said her niece recalled that, seconds before the
blast, as police officers alerted to a bomb mistakenly led crowds
toward the explosion, not away from it, an older woman had turned
to her and her friends and said, ``This is the real thing, this
time, girls.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The girls began to laugh at the woman,'' Ms. Heffernan said.
``Then the blast hit them.''
</P>
<P>
   All around her, people were teary-eyed and spoke in low voices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this means the end of the war,'' said Joseph Harley,
owner of a construction equipment company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' said his wife, Veronica. ``But too late for Omagh.'' &QL;

COMMENTARY: SURE THINGS _ TAXES, NIMBYS AND WAVING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By EVELYN NIEVES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A late-summer breather to catch up on a few stories:
</P>
<P>
   There are NIMBY movements and there are NIMBY movements. When
New Horizons in Autism Inc. of Cranbury, N.J., tried to buy a house
in Englishtown as a group home for five autistic teen-agers, it
encountered the Godzilla of NIMBYs (whose name is an acronym for
Not In My Back Yard) on a street called Hospitality Way. The group
home will open in November, but not in their back yard, or even
their town.
</P>
<P>
   Michele Goodman, the executive director of New Horizons, won't
say where. This is to protect her clients, and the owner of the
house her group is buying, from the hysteria that overcame
Hospitality Way.
</P>
<P>
   What happened is that a group of neighbors on Hospitality Way
decided that five developmentally disabled teen-agers, monitored 24
hours a day, would be a threat to their children and property
values.
</P>
<P>
   They offered New Horizons $10,000 to look elsewhere, and then
challenged New Horizons' bid on the house because it was higher
than the market value, a no-no for organizations receiving state
funding. Then the neighbors pooled their money, formed a
corporation and outbid New Horizons for the house.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development is helping New
Horizons by challenging both the assessor who decided that New
Horizons' bid was above market value and _ on grounds of
discrimination _ the people on Hospitality Way who blocked the
sale.
</P>
<P>
   Still, NIMBYs could prevail in their battle against group homes.
A bill before the House Judiciary Committee sponsored by Brian
Bilbray, R-Calif., would weaken the Fair Housing Act for the
mentally disabled by allowing state and local governments to decide
where group homes could be located.
</P>
<P>
   At least one local New Jersey legislator, Gerald Zecker, a
Republican assemblyman from Clifton, has been lobbying for the bill
on behalf of his constituents who don't want group homes where they
live.
</P>
<P>
   The news is not all bad for a couple who moved to Delaware
County, N.Y., in the Catskills to build their dream house, only to
find themselves caught between two towns _ both claiming that the
house fell within their boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   For two years, Elinor Burkett and Dennis Gaboury were getting
two property-tax bills for their lovely house _ one from the town
of Stamford and one from Roxbury. All evidence, including a tax
map, placed the house in Stamford, and recently a local court told
Roxbury officials to stop their pursuit of the property taxes.
Delaware County then canceled the Roxbury portion of the couple's
tax bills.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this tangle isn't over. Roxbury, which has already spent
$50,000 pursuing the Burkett-Gaboury $4,000-a-year tax bill, is
filing a lawsuit challenging the county tax map. This could set a
precedent that would throw longstanding tax maps all over New York
state into question.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ms. Burkett and Gaboury, who have kept a sense of
humor about this, are in the process of filing a $225 million
federal civil rights suit against Roxbury and Roxbury officials.
</P>
<P>
   There is better news for a former day laborer, Jose Martinez,
and CLIP, the lawn-mowing co-op he has helped to operate out of the
Workplace Project, a workers' rights group in Hempstead, N.Y. After
hearing about the struggling co-op, a kind soul donated nearly
$3,000 so CLIP could buy one of the high-powered mowers that its
competitors in the landscaping business use. CLIP is plowing ahead,
gathering new clients and putting in long hours.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, no-news-is-good-news news: Joe Cerce is still waving in
Totowa, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   In March, when this writer first visited Cerce, the 80-year-old
retired factory worker was starting his warm-weather routine of
sitting in front of his house, waving at cars. A spot check
Saturday morning found him right there. He was under a blue and
white beach umbrella, wearing a blue Passaic County Sheriff's
Department T-shirt and a red baseball cap. ``Hi, hi, hi,'' he said
as cars passed. Same as always.
</P>
<P>
   These days, when news is almost too much to bear, not even
counting the Sunday-morning interview shows, Joe Cerce in his
chair, waving, looks awfully reassuring. ``Oh, yeah, I'm still
here,'' he said, watching a line of cars pass. ``Hi, hi, hi, hi.''

 By LESLIE EATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Waiting for an elevator in a building in Chinatown
last week, the brown-clad UPS guy stared intently at his hand-held
computer. It was not the United Parcel Service's package-tracking
device, though he had one of those, too.
</P>
<P>
   No, the deliveryman, Mark Candella, was staring at stock market
information on his Quotrek portable quotation machine, which he
does, he says, only in his free moments. He was trying to decide
whether to sell the shares of Lucent Technologies he had bought
earlier that day.
</P>
<P>
   Similar concerns were on the mind of Carlos Rubino, who drives a
yellow cab. Parked at a taxi stand in midtown last week, he was
trying to sell 2,000 shares of a semiconductor stock using his
laptop computer, which was beaming in the order to Charles Schwab &AMP;
Co. Rubino who emphasizes that he never trades while the cab is in
motion.
</P>
<P>
   Rubino, 41, and Candella, 27, have become entranced by the stock
market in the last year _ and they are not alone. Receptionists,
doormen and construction workers have joined dentists, architects
and lawyers as stock market mavens. More Americans appear to be
tracking stocks, talking about them, and, in some cases, trading
them, than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it can be hard to get away from the stock market,
especially on days like Friday, when the Dow Jones industrial
average plunged 280 points before recovering in the afternoon. (It
closed down about 78 points.)
</P>
<P>
   Television sets in restaurants, bars and airport lounges are
tuned to financial networks that did not even exist 10 years ago.
CNBC reports that its viewership increased 75 percent in the last
year, and as many as 1 million households have tuned in right after
the market's 4 p.m. close.
</P>
<P>
   Computer screens all over the country flicker with stock charts
(CNNfn's Web site has become a favorite with the cognoscenti).
``I'm lucky my boss is interested in the market, too,'' said
Hernando Ruiz, a Manhattan architect who keeps stock prices running
in the background on his office computer.
</P>
<P>
   Magazines on every newsstand tout ``10 Funds To Buy Now'' or, in
the case of the current Worth magazine, ``How To Live Rich.'' (Jane
Bryant Quinn, the dean of personal-finance journalism, warns that
some of these articles are the investment version of pornography.)
</P>
<P>
   And then there are all those people using cellular phones to
make trades in restaurants, on the beach, in cabs. Charles Schwab
gets 300,000 calls a day on its automated phone-trading system.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is understandable given that almost half of U.S.
households now have some exposure to the stock market, either
through direct ownership of shares, through mutual funds or through
the nearly ubiquitous 401(k) retirement plans, according to Federal
Reserve Board studies. In 1989, less than a third of households
did.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, last year Americans had more of their assets tied up in
stocks than in their homes _ the first time that has been the case
since the booming market of the late 1960s. More than 28 percent of
household assets are in stocks, which is the highest level since
the Fed began keeping figures after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the market has invaded popular culture. Advertising
campaigns, New Yorker cartoons, even mass-market movies now feature
the stock market. Ron Insana, an anchor on CNBC, says his voice and
image have appeared in three films, most recently ``How Stella Got
Her Groove Back.''
</P>
<P>
   He also appears larger than life on the giant television screen
at Times Square. ``If we get a 1,000-point down day, people are
going to be driving on the sidewalk,'' Insana said, adding that
interest in the stock market ``is way beyond cocktail party chatter
at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Market mania has created a whole new group of celebrities, from
Warren Buffett to James Cramer (a money manager who has become the
John Madden of investment commentary) to Laszlo Birinyi, a market
guru in Greenwich, Conn., who appears on PBS' ``Wall Street Week
With Louis Rukeyser.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish the market was this important when I was single,''
Birinyi said, adding that people come up to him on the street, in
airline terminals and in railroad stations to chat about the
market.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One manifestation of Americans' obsession with the market is the
changing nature of stock fraud. Trading on illegal insider
information has moved ``from Wall Street to Main Street,'' said
Richard Walker, director of enforcement for the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   When Walker ran the commission's New York office in the 1980s,
most insider trading was done by securities kingpins like Ivan
Boesky, he said. Now, he added, ``it's neighbors, friends,
boyfriends and girlfriends tipping off their fathers, mothers,
sisters and cousins.''
</P>
<P>
   This trend is reflected in almost all of the SEC's
insider-trading prosecutions in the last few years, including the
case of an AT&AMP;T labor negotiator who was accused of tipping off
more than a dozen friends and relatives about pending takeovers; 16
people have settled charges so far.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Americans have always become interested in the stock
market when it has gone up _ which is exactly what it has been
doing since 1994. ``It's like your hometown sports team,'' said
Martin Fridson, a managing director of Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and the
author of several books about the market. ``The hard-core fans are
always there, but attendance goes up when they are championship
contenders.''
</P>
<P>
   Mutual funds boomed in the go-go 1960s, Walter Winchell
broadcast stock tips to the masses in the early 1950s, and before
the crash of 1929, speculators like William Durant, Bernard Baruch
and Joseph Kennedy became household names. Indeed, Kennedy said he
got out of the market when his shoeshine man began giving him stock
tips _ and ever since, some market gurus have seen widespread
public interest in the stock market as a sign that it has peaked.
</P>
<P>
   But any investor who jumped out when the general public jumped
in has missed three years of enormous profits, when the average
stock mutual fund rose almost 90 percent, according to Lipper
Analytical Services, which compiles fund data.
</P>
<P>
   Some historians suggest that a number of factors are at work in
today's market popularity, including the growing involvement of
many Americans in the market through the 401(k) and stock-purchase
plans offered by their employers.
</P>
<P>
   Just as striking are the technological advances that have
utterly changed the face of stock trading. A decade ago, anyone who
wanted to buy or sell a stock had to call his or her broker to get
the price, and then pay a hefty sum to complete the trade. Today,
stock prices are available to anyone with a television, radio or
computer, and investors can trade on line for as little as $10 a
transaction.
</P>
<P>
   And even conservative investors find themselves paying more
attention to their portfolios, just because they can. Duncan
Cameron, a film editor and director who began investing more than a
decade ago, used to read his brokerage statement every month _ when
he remembered. Now, he looks at his portfolio every night on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is an information revolution first, and a stock
revolution second,'' said Charles Geisst, author of ``Wall Street:
A History'' (Oxford University Press, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   ``The more information people see about something, the less they
are afraid of it,'' he added, speaking from South Carolina, where
he was vacationing (and watching the market's movements on
television).
</P>
<P>
   That is certainly true of Candella, the UPS employee. An
enthusiastic autodidact (he has picked up enough Cantonese to
converse with people on his route), Candella first encountered the
stock market when some of his customers were chatting about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone said it was too risky _ they try and dissuade you,''
he recalled. So he borrowed a book on personal finance and read it.
He bought some UPS stock through his company. Then he spent two
months tracking stocks, watching how they moved up and down.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, he began trading technology stocks, tracking them on
his Quotrek and calling in his trades from pay phones. He looks for
stocks that move a lot in a day, and where trading volume is high.
He seldom holds a stock overnight. Declines, like those the market
has suffered recently, are his buying opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   And he has made a mint. So far this year, his portfolio has
almost doubled, and he has paid off his wife's student loans and
bought a new sport utility vehicle, an Eddie Bauer model of the
Ford Expedition.
</P>
<P>
   But Candella has been very disciplined about his finances. He
and his wife put the maximum allowable into their 401(k) plans at
work. They owe no money except their home mortgage, which they plan
to pay off within four years.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, he said, the stock trading is really just a hobby,
and something to talk to his customers about. His bosses do not
mind, he said, as long as stock trading doesn't interfere with his
work; he insists it does not.
</P>
<P>
   Why doesn't he stay home and trade full time? ``I guess I could
make a lot more money with stocks,'' he said, ``But I really,
really, really love my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubino, the cabby, said that he, too, had no desire to become a
full-time trader _ too stressful. But as a hobby, researching and
trading stocks is relaxing for him, like exercising. (A physical
education major in his native Brazil, he spends an hour and a half
every day at the gym.) ``I have another thing to occupy me, so I'm
not just getting upset with other drivers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While he is frugal and never trades with money that he needs,
Rubino does have a stock market goal. But it is not about trading.
He has invested in his cousin's small restaurant chain in Denver _
called Rodizio Grill _ and he hopes to take it public in a stock
offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the American dream _ why not?'' he said. ``In America,
anything can happen.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. _ In his 45 years, Chuck Zito has been many
things: outlaw biker, convict, bodyguard to the stars and stunt
man.
</P>
<P>
   Now Zito, president of the New York Nomads chapter of the Hell's
Angels motorcycle club, is trying to engineer a leap from macho man
to movie star.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a bodyguard, I met the celebrities and progressed from
there into stunt work,'' he said. ``Now I'm ready to progress into
bigger and better parts. I'm just waiting for that leading role, to
become the next Rocky or Rambo.''
</P>
<P>
   Zito had his first taste of the movies in 1979, when he appeared
on screen with his custom-painted Harley-Davidson. The following
year, he used his Hollywood connections to start a bodyguard
service that attracted celebrity clients like Sylvester Stallone,
Mickey Rourke and Sean Penn.
</P>
<P>
   Since then he has worked on more than 50 films, mostly as a
stunt man. But last winter, Zito won his best role yet, a part in
``Oz,'' a prison drama series on HBO in which he plays Chuckie
Pancamo, the enforcer for a group of Italian inmates.
</P>
<P>
   His desire to act, he said, arose in part from the frustration
of watching movie stars do imitations of the man he is in daily
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watch a lot of these actors and say to myself, `I could do
it better,''' he said. ``They're trying to look like what I really
am, but they're not living it day to day.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1985 to 1991, Zito was in prison serving a sentence for
drug conspiracy, an experience that informs his work on ``Oz.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings so much authority and credibility to the role,''
said Tom Fontana, the show's executive producer. ``But I really
think that comes from his whole life as opposed to just his time in
prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to people like Fontana, Zito's life, which once revolved
around parole boards, motorcycles and trips to the gym, has
broadened to include screen tests and casting calls. He is also
trying to sell a movie treatment he has written, titled ``The
American Way,'' which documents his progress from the Hell's Angels
to Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hollywood, of all things, that first drew him to the
motorcycle club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to watch their movies like `Hell's Angels On Wheels'
and `Hell's Angels '69' as a kid,'' he said. ``They were the elite
of the elite, the No. 1. They were the ones who actually inspired
me to ride a bike.''
</P>
<P>
   In his early 20s, Zito bought a 1969 Harley-Davidson Sportster,
which he rode to boxing practice at the former Gramercy Gym on East
14th Street in New York. It was there, he said, that he met Sandy
Alexander, a professional boxer, who was president of the Hell's
Angels' New York City chapter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I introduced myself and told him I'd built and hand-painted my
own bike,'' he said. ``Soon enough, I was painting all the Angels'
bikes. And after doing the `hang-around' process for a while, they
took a vote, and I was in.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the city chapter, which has a clubhouse in the East
Village, Zito's Nomads group roams the open highway from Syracuse
to the northern border of the five boroughs. While he refused to
disclose the number of members in the group (``That's for the cops
to figure out,'' he says), he said he has led the chapter almost
from the day he helped found it in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Though he became a Hell's Angel nearly 20 years ago, boxed as an
amateur for several years and caused a stir in February by knocking
out Jean-Claude Van Damme, the martial artist turned movie star, in
a fracas in the East Side strip club Scores, Zito has a remarkably
strong domestic side. Although he is divorced, he said he sees his
former wife, Kathy, frequently as well as his daughter, Lisa, a
Manhattan entertainment lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from his family and the movies, his true love is his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do a movie, get the money, and put it right into my house,''
he said. In the last six years, he has stripped the house in New
Rochelle of wooden shingles, re-faced it with brick and stone, and
wants to install a swimming pool and a miniature waterfall in the
back yard. The only thing that stops him now is money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say to myself, with the people I know, the people I've
bodyguarded for, I should be retired today,'' he said. ``Done.
Rich. Over with. But I've never taken anything from anybody. So I
just plug along.''
</P>
<P>
   Over a lunch of tuna salad and potato chips, he spoke about
turning 50 in five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started late in the acting business,'' he said. ``The
Leonardo DiCaprios and Brad Pitts, they're young guys. That's why I
always say I've got to make it now, because I'm not getting any
younger.''

RAPE RESISTS INROADS OF WAR ON CRIME
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In an era of plummeting crime rates, there is one
category of violent offender that has resisted the trend: the
rapist.
</P>
<P>
   New York City's murder rate has plunged 60 percent in four
years; robberies have dropped nearly 50 percent. But reports of
rape are down only 13 percent in the same time period and have
shown only a small decline this year, police statistics show.
</P>
<P>
   The many factors credited with making New York's streets so safe
_ the new policing tactics, the quality-of-life crackdown, the
waning crack epidemic, the booming economy _ have had only a
limited effect on the rape rate, the police and prosecutors say.
The reasons are varied, they say, but all serve to underscore their
belief that among violent crimes, rape stands apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a completely different animal that you can't prevent
through traditional crime-fighting techniques,'' said Marjory
Fisher, who heads the Queens district attorney's special victims
bureau. ``When you flood a corner with police officers or attack
quality-of-life crimes, you may affect the gun rate or the drug
arrest rate, but you aren't going to affect the rape rate.''
</P>
<P>
   A primary reason, Ms. Fisher said, is that in most cases,
rapists know their victims, exploiting an intimacy that allows them
to attack behind closed doors, away from other people, beyond the
reach of the police. In such circumstances, placing bars on
windows, avoiding dark alleys and not talking to strangers are no
protection.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 2,779 rapes reported in New York City last year, more
than 75 percent were said to be committed by an acquaintance or
relative of the victim, the police said, a figure that they said
was borne out year to year.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir points to this statistic as the
best explanation for the relatively slow decline in rapes compared
with other violent crimes. The number of reported rapes remains
high simply because women are far more likely now than in years
past to report acquaintance rape, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani have repeatedly
commended the police department's efforts to expand resources used
to combat rape and to remove the stigma that has kept many victims
from going to the police for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of those rapes would not have been reported in the past
because people did not have the confidence that they would be
treated with sensitivity and anonymity,'' Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the police and prosecutors' offices have
established special units of investigators trained to deal with the
particular difficulties that emerge when questioning victims of sex
crimes. Many hospitals also have hired counselors to assist rape
victims.
</P>
<P>
   Media coverage of some of these innovations has prompted some
rape victims to report their assaults, said Casey Jordan, an
associate professor of justice and law administration at Western
Connecticut State University. Even coverage of some notorious rape
trials like those involving William Kennedy Smith in Florida and
Alex Kelly in Connecticut have encouraged some to come forward, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outcome of these cases is irrelevant,'' said Ms. Jordan,
who specializes in studying rape trends. ``The message that women
have gotten is that the victim has fought to see a rapist brought
to justice and these victims have been seen as heroines.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor affecting rape statistics, the police say, is the
difficulty in capturing the small but troubling number of rapists
who repeatedly attack strangers. The number of rapes by strangers
has risen 8 percent in New York City this year, after a 20 percent
drop in the previous three, police statistics show.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they do not believe that there are more rapists
on the loose, only that they have been able to cover their tracks
even after multiple assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Many rapists have been able to circumvent recent advances in DNA
fingerprinting and fiber analysis by such simple acts as wearing
gloves, masks and condoms, investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   One rapist who has eluded capture by using these tactics is a
man thought to be responsible for more than 30 attacks in the last
four years on women in upper Manhattan and the Bronx. The police
say he has disguised his appearance with scarves, bandannas,
handkerchiefs and ski masks. He attacks women quickly from behind
as they enter apartment buildings, elevators or alleys from Harlem
to the northeastern Bronx, they said.
</P>
<P>
   His constant characteristics appear to be that he carries a
black gun, takes only gold jewelry, orders his victims not to look
at his face, and uses condoms.
</P>
<P>
   The police say condom use among rapists is on the rise, noting
that some rape victims have pleaded with their attacker to use them
because of the fear of AIDS. While that may minimize the health
risk for the victim, the use of condoms denies investigators an
important type of evidence, the so-called genetic fingerprint that
forensic experts can recover from semen.
</P>
<P>
   These factors add to the already peculiar difficulties that
detectives face in trying to capture stranger rapists, who, unlike
most other criminals, nearly always work alone, seldom brag about
their exploits and usually commit the act at a time and in a place
they have scouted out and chosen precisely for its lack of
witnesses.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Unlike homicide or a robbery, very rarely do they say to their
buddies, `Hey, I raped that woman in the paper yesterday,''' said
Lt. Susan Morley, head of the police department's sex crimes
liaison unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really don't get many tips on these crimes,'' she added,
noting that homicides usually involve a connection between victim
and assailant, and that robbers can often be traced through the
property they have stolen.
</P>
<P>
   And even if a rapist is caught, there is no guarantee that he
will go to prison. While the conviction rate in homicide cases
routinely reaches above 85 percent, the rate for rape cases usually
is 40 percent to 50 percent _ making it more likely that some
rapists will be freed to rape again, prosecutors say.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the encouraging increase in the willingness of women to
report rape, many experts say that sexual assaults continue to be
the most underreported of all major crimes and that they are
believed to occur twice as often as the statistics show.
</P>
<P>
   According to a well-regarded 1992 independent study, ``Rape in
America,'' 13 percent of all women have been raped at least once.
And 62 percent of the rapes happened before the women turned 18,
according to the study, conducted by the National Crime Victims
Research and Treatment Center at the Medical University of South
Carolina and by the National Victims Center in Arlington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Eleanor Pam, who heads the research and resource center on
domestic violence at New York's John Jay College of Criminal
Justice, said that while it was impossible to determine if the
number of rapes are really rising or falling, the increase in the
number of women willing to report the crime was a significant
bellwether.
</P>
<P>
   She added, however, that she took little comfort in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``These statistics show that violence against women continues
unabated and that we haven't done anything significantly to impact
it,'' she said. ``We are just beginning to acknowledge it as a
crime and accept the scope of its diversity.''

AT 62, GARY PLAYER IS STILL GOING STRONG 
</HEADLINE>
  (ak) 
 By JACK CAVANAUGH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERICHO, N.Y. _ Approaching his 63rd birthday, Gary Player is
one of the best-conditioned athletes in the world, and no doubt one
of the the most-traveled ones, too. But Player, in his 45th year as
a professional golfer, shows no signs of letting up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to be still playing at 70,'' Player said here Friday
after shooting a 4-under-par 68 to tie for second place in the
Northville Long Island Classic Senior PGA tournament. ``And I see
no reason why I shouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the first golfer to practice physical fitness vigorously
on a regular basis, Player still works out daily, either at home in
South Africa, in a hotel room or in the physical fitness van that
accompanies golfers on the Senior PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   In large measure because of that regimen, which mainly includes
calisthenics and lifting weights, Player looks, and apparently is,
as fit and trim at 62 as he was in his prime. That's saying
something, because he won 21 titles on the PGA Tour and became the
third of only four golfers to win all four Grand Slam tournaments
(the others are Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan and Jack Nicklaus). He has
won 18 times on the Senior Tour for players 50 and over, and three
senior events overseas.
</P>
<P>
   For a while last year, though, it looked as if time might
finally have caught up with Player. He had not won on the PGA
Senior Tour since 1995, and after missing two months of play early
last year following surgery for a double hernia, Player managed
only one top-10 finish in the 22 tournaments in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But in 12 tournaments this year, he has rebounded with three
finishes in the top 10. And his 68 on Friday at the Meadow Brook
Club here, which tied him with Lee Trevino and four others, three
strokes behind Walter Hall, put him in contention to win the
54-hole tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Player still finds victory exulting, even after winning 162
tournaments worldwide, including three Masters, three British
Opens, two P.G.A. Championships and one U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I won the British Senior Open last year, it was one of
the most cherished moments of my career,'' he said, ``because to
win a major at 62 is very special.''
</P>
<P>
   A devoted family man with six children and six grandchildren,
with four more expected by Christmas, Player concedes that all of
the travel is one of the drawbacks of a charmed existence. ``It's
lonely being away from my family,'' said Player, who, while still
playing a relatively full golf schedule, designs golf courses, owns
a stable of race horses and operates a ranch in his native South
Africa. ``But I love golf _ although I love ranching as much _ and
want to continue playing.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Player estimates that he travels about 300,000 miles a year _
``about as much as I did when I played the regular tour, because of
my golf-course design and playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Candor has always been as much a part of Player's makeup as the
black outfits he used to wear on the golf course. And that has not
changed. He once said golfers were the world's worst-conditioned
athletes and that he, himself, had to look to other athletic
pursuits, such as tennis, for aerobic activity. On Friday, he was
critical of some of the new courses that pros find themselves
playing on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the modern-day courses are terrible,'' he said. ``They
put in deep bunkers in front of the greens, which, in many cases,
are too severe and undulating. They seem to forget that golf
courses should be built for the members, not for the professionals.
That's why I love an old course like the one we're playing on here,
where you can run the ball up.'' &QL;

TECHNOLOGY BRINGS COMPUTERS TO FANS AT THE BALLPARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK DAVIS  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) _ The roaring crowd confirms the pickoff move at
second base was close. Too bad you missed it because the fan in
front of you was getting up.
</P>
<P>
   Tap on the computer screen and _ problem solved _ you get a
replay from any camera angle in the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   After booing the umpire, you can tap in a food order, check the
progress of other games in the league, see whether Mark McGwire has
homered again, even find out that the other team's shortstop is
hitting below .200, the infamous Mendoza line.
</P>
<P>
   No, this isn't the Internet. It's not virtual baseball either.
It's called ChoiceSeat.
</P>
<P>
   There are 100 ChoiceSeats in Tropicana Field, the home of the
Tampa Bay Devil Rays, where the Royals opened a three-game series
Friday night. Each seat has a computer screen attached to the arm
rest. Fans can tap different points on the screen to use any of the
features ChoiceSeat offers.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm Stadium, where the National League's San Diego Padres
play, has 400 ChoiceSeats that were installed for Super Bowl XXXII.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa-based Williams Cos. Inc. tested its ChoiceSeats in the two
stadiums. Barry Goldberg, who is general manager with Williams'
ChoiceSeat business unit, said fans can expect to see ChoiceSeats
in three or four more baseball stadiums next season, and all
ballparks eventually.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect to see them at Kauffman Stadium soon.
</P>
<P>
   Art Chaudry, senior vice president of operations for the Kansas
City Royals, said the idea sounds fascinating, but the Royals
aren't shopping yet. He said ``necessities,'' such as new seats
with cupholders, are on the priority list for Kauffman Stadium, not
``luxuries'' like computer screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're learning how to crawl before we run,'' Chaudry said of
the Royals' stadium upgrade plans.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, some fans wonder whether the ChoiceSeat features would
be worth the extra price. Nor are they sure who'd want to use them.
</P>
<P>
   Connie Oppitz and David Sexton sat only a few seats from each
other at last Sunday's game between the Royals and Devil Rays at
Kauffman Stadium. But they were on opposite sides of the
fan-interest issue.
</P>
<P>
   Sexton said he thought casual baseball fans would be wooed by a
ChoiceSeat screen. True fans wouldn't want the distraction, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you mess around with the computer a lot, you're going to
miss the game,'' said Sexton, a Parkville, Mo., resident who splits
season tickets with a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, said Oppitz from Overland Park, Kan. She said the
die-hard baseball fan would love to pore over statistics, see
replays from several camera angles and such. It's a great idea but
it's not for the sometimes fan, she said.
</P>
<P>
   They agreed, however, about how often they'd be willing to pay
extra for a ChoiceSeat _ occasionally. Sexton said he wouldn't want
the added cost for his season tickets, and Oppitz said she'd only
want to pay extra for a ChoiceSeat a few times to check it out.
</P>
<P>
   That's not really a choice for season ticket holders because the
ChoiceSeat addition is stationary. Fans gain access to the machine
for the price of their game ticket.
</P>
<P>
   And it's difficult to say how much more that ChoiceSeat ticket
would cost.
</P>
<P>
   At Tropicana Field, a seat with the ChoiceSeat screens costs
$195 _ per game. But that's not because they're ChoiceSeats, said
John Higgins, senior vice president with the Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   The team installed its 100 ChoiceSeat screens in a section
directly behind home plate. Fans in these seats are closer to home
plate than the pitcher is. Waiters jot down their orders and
deliver the food and beverages. These would be choice seats even
without the ChoiceSeats.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg said Williams Cos. isn't aiming for that small,
expensive section of seats. Tropicana Field's exclusive section was
just a test area; Williams Cos. wants to see ChoiceSeats spread
much more broadly in a stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't go into Kansas City, for example, and want those
seats to be $200 seats,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg wants ChoiceSeats in typical seats, say, $15 seats. The
added cost might push the ticket to $20 or $22.50, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If it were up to Goldberg, fans might not have to pay extra for
the fancy computer features. They could sneak down to an empty
ChoiceSeat during the game.
</P>
<P>
   That's not possible at Tropicana Field, Higgins said. Ushers
limit access to the high-price section where the ChoiceSeats were
installed. But access would be limited to ticket holders even
without the computers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   One factor in how widely ChoiceSeats spread is their cost to
install, run and maintain. Goldberg said the only maintenance
problem Williams Cos. has encountered is with the screen surface.
It scratches too easily. But, he said, this can be fixed by using a
different screen in future models.
</P>
<P>
   Football fans, however, may not see ChoiceSeats at all. Goldberg
said at current costs for the computer screens and data, stadiums
couldn't charge enough for the few football games to make
ChoiceSeats profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball and hockey, which have more games than football,
might work. Williams Cos. is studying the possibilities.

BOATS-IN-MOATS ISSUE WILL APPEAR ON MISSOURI BALLOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM and WILL SENTELL  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) _ The boats-in-moats casino issue and another to ban
cockfighting and other animal cruelty will appear on Missouri's
November ballot, Secretary of State Rebecca Cook announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The gambling measure, to be listed on the ballot as
Constitutional Amendment 9, asks Missouri voters to decide whether
games of chance should be allowed on riverboats that float in
artificial basins fed by river water.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-cockfighting measure will be known as Proposition A and
would make animal fighting a felony punishable by up to five years
in prison. It would also make attending an animal fight a
misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the petition drives to place the measures on the
ballot, Cook also said a criminal investigation was continuing into
allegations of fraud in the gathering of signatures for the
riverboat measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we are at the very beginning of a very large
investigation,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she had no reason to believe that the suspected
fraudulent activity was linked to any organized effort by
pro-gambling forces.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said most of the alleged fraud was linked to a petition
circulator identified as David D. Jackson, who she said worked for
Petition Management Inc., a California firm that paid workers to
gather Missouri voters' signatures on petitions.
</P>
<P>
   The signs of fraud were so obvious that the circulator ``must
have thought we were idiots,'' said Cook. Dead people, ministers
known to oppose casinos and relatives of county officials who said
they had not signed also showed up on petitions, Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 7,078 signatures gathered by Jackson was counted,
Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson apparently used a Springfield motel as his home address.
State officials believe Jackson, who may be an Oklahoma resident,
has left the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fraud uncovered here is absolutely incredible and
despicable,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the seriousness of the allegations, Cook said, the final
tally of names on the gambling petitions was not affected. Gambling
supporters gathered about 30,000 signatures more than the 114,000
needed to place the measure on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Don Poston, a spokesman for the casino-sponsored group
Missourians For Fairness and Jobs in St. Louis, said his group will
cooperate with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, Poston said passage of the measure will
preserve thousands of jobs and millions of tax dollars now going to
Missouri schools. ``There is a fundamental question of fairness,''
he added, in that state gaming authorities approved the off-river
operations years ago, triggering more than $1 billion worth of
casino construction in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Supreme Court last year outlawed games of chance at
off-river boats in response to a lawsuit by St. Louis area gambling
foes.
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the state's 15 riverboat casinos are threatened by the
action. In the Kansas City area that includes two vessels each
operated by Harrah's and Station Casino, and the Flamingo Hilton

   Mark Andrews, chairman of the St. Louis-based anti-gambling

TWA PILOTS COMPLETE VOTING ON PACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) _ Trans World Airlines' pilots completed voting Friday
on a tentative contract agreement between their union and the
company, but nobody is making predictions about the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The ballots will be tabulated at the Air Line Pilots
Association's office in Washington. The results are expected to be
announced Aug. 31, said Gina Butikofer, a spokeswoman for TWA's
pilots union.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Chronic, master chairman of TWA's unit of the pilots union,
said a polling of the pilots three weeks ago showed then that the
vote was too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a large number of pilots who don't care for the
tentative agreement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chronic said Air Line Pilots Association, which represents more
than 2,500 TWA pilots, also was upset last week when the company
announced that all airline employees working under their old
contracts would receive a 4.8 percent raise on Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think management was trying to tell our pilots that they're
not going to lose anything significant by voting against the new
contract offer,'' he said. ``At least they would get a minimal
raise while holding out for a better offer.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilots union has responded by telling its members that TWA
would save $20 million over six months if the tentative agreement
is rejected. The average pilot would make $1,000 a month more in
salary for the rest of the year under the new contract compared to
the 4.8 percent raise if the offer is rejected, Chronic said.
</P>
<P>
   Chronic said TWA seems to be meddling with the ratification
process of the pilots' new contract. ``We don't know why they
couldn't have waited till next week to make that announcement,
after all the votes are in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   TWA declined to comment on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken the position to not get involved in the matter,''
said Jim Brown, a TWA spokesman in St. Louis. ``I can say we signed
the (tentative) contract because we believed in it and think it's a
good one.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all pilots do. Some of TWA's pilots union members have
created a vocal opposition group called the ``Contract Awareness
Committee.'' The group's main complaint is that the agreement gives
too much to the younger pilots at the expense of the senior pilots
who have taken the biggest concessions over the past 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the four-year contract will bring pilots' pay to 90
percent of the industry standard by the year 2002, which the
opponents say is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots union wants to eliminate the two-tier wage system
that was in place for the younger pilots. The lower wages for newer
hires has created a high turnover rate among the younger pilots.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the new contract gives the union 1 million shares
of TWA stock. Union leaders have said the veteran pilots would
receive a greater proportion of the stock to make up for the
smaller percentage raises they would receive than the younger
pilots at the beginning of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Machinists union, which represents about 75
percent of TWA employees, has continued negotiating and has stated
that it would be satisfied with pay increases that would bring
wages within 90 percent of the industry average.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of speculation about whether the pilots'
contract will pass or not,'' said Keith Nelson, president of
Machinists Local 1650 in Kansas City. About 2,500 union machinists
work at TWA's jet overhaul base at Kansas City International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson also said the 4.8 percent raise in September for all
employees is a previous commitment TWA made when the company sought
concessions from its workers three years ago. Employees should not
consider the pay increase as being part of a new contract the
Machinists are trying to negotiate with management, Nelson said.

ROYALS BOARD SHOULD HAVE SPELLED IT OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kansas City, Mo. - The big news Thursday was expected to be a
major revelation about the Royals' search for a new owner.
</P>
<P>
   While that news did indeed top the agenda, the more significant
disclosure was that the Royals directors had muddied the process by
their apparent failure to be perfectly clear when articulating the
rules of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The story's lead, of course, was the anointing of New Yorker
Miles Prentice as owner apparent. The significance of the
development was confounded, however, by the board's caveat that
Prentice's success depended on raising half the purchase price from
local backers. The precise amount of additional local money needed
to meet that mandate is a matter of speculation.
</P>
<P>
   All this came as a surprise to many who have followed the
process closely. Prentice said he first became aware of the
requirement earlier this month, but learned only Thursday that it
was included in the Royals articles of incorporation. Not to worry,
though, Prentice said, because if that's what's required, it will
be done. Meanwhile, Royals president Michael Herman challenged
Kansas Citians of means to kick into the kitty to support
Prentice's bid.
</P>
<P>
   Herman's exhortation might have carried more potency, though, if
the Royals board hadn't created the perception of not being as
forthright as it should have been when initially articulating the
terms of the sale. Royals executives seem to think its mere
inclusion in the articles of incorporation speaks for itself and is
thus sufficient, but that's debatable. So is the claim that
documents made available in May included the stipulation.
</P>
<P>
   When the team went up for sale, a table of explicit commandments
should have been prominently displayed for all interested parties _
including the tire kickers _ to see:
</P>
<P>
   1. Thou shalt pay $75 million.
</P>
<P>
   2. Thou shalt not move the team out of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   3. Thou shalt raise half the purchase money from local sources.
</P>
<P>
   The first two commandments were always unmistakeably
articulated. The third wasn't. Charlie Crumpley, who has been a
lead reporter on the story, reviewed related coverage, but failed
to turn up any specific mention by Royals executives or document
references concerning the 50 percent local ownership requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Prospective local bidders might also wonder why a New York
lawyer and his expert advisers weren't more careful during their
due diligence when reading the fine print of all the pertinent
documents. Prentice has a law degree and experience with buying
sports franchises, and shouldn't have been blind-sided this late in
the game.
</P>
<P>
   That said, however, it doesn't excuse the failure of the Royals
directors to be as up front as circumstances now reveal they should
have been. Some observers of the skeptical persuasion smell a game
of hide-the-cookie and fume that the rules are being changed in the
middle of the game.
</P>
<P>
   While such suspicions may be understandable, the board must be
taken at its word. It's a dedicated group of upstanding citizens
doing a thankless job. Its members deserve a world of credit for
their labors in Kansas City's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   And while the board bears blame for any confusion, Prentice
exacerbated things by his failure to follow what should have been
his lawyerly instincts.
</P>
<P>
   How all this is going to affect the community's ability to
retain its big-league baseball team is now up to its deep-pocketed
civic leaders.

 ERIC ADLER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) _ Yippee, a new school year.
</P>
<P>
   But what's this? Your teacher is ... Mrs. Grundle!
</P>
<P>
   Nooooo!
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the horror.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the inhumanity.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, what should parents do when their child just can't stand a
teacher? What course does one take once the school year starts and
complaints from a child begin mounting like galoshes in the
cloakroom?
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, Mrs. Grundle yells.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad, Mr. Blather's boring.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, Ms. Miff doesn't like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Students, of course, complain constantly. To many, any teacher
with expectations of work beyond coloring pumpkins is an unpitying
martinet. Moreover, teachers are frequently denounced based not on
any real knowledge, but on years of mythology: ``Dad, everyone says
Mr. Hoggosian is the devil!''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, said Carolyn Callahan, a professor at the
University of Virginia in Charlottesville and immediate past
president of the National Association for Gifted Children, while
most teachers are committed to truly enlightening students, crummy
teachers do exist.
</P>
<P>
   Some _ not most, mind you _ are bad. Unimaginative. Boring.
Burned out. So ill-informed they'd fail their own subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Still others, Callahan said, don't like children. ``Not everyone
is Mr. Rogers. And we can't expect that to be the case.''
</P>
<P>
   But parents should expect their children to be well educated.
The difficulty is sorting out if a child's complaints have merit,
and how to proceed without jeopardizing the essential relationship
shared between child and teacher.
</P>
<P>
   The first step? The National Education Association, the American
Federation of Teachers, the National Parent Teacher Association and
the National Association of Gifted Children all agree:
</P>
<P>
   Search for the truth. Before yanking your child from class,
storming the principal's office or confronting your child's
teacher, do your best to discern the real issue or problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children,'' Callahan said, ``may not always tell you what the
real problem is.''
</P>
<P>
   Grade expectations
</P>
<P>
   A child may complain about a teacher, while the actual problem
is unrelated.
</P>
<P>
   Some students, for example, may bad-mouth a teacher when the
real problem is the changing expectations of higher grades, such as
the call for additional homework and more independent and critical
thinking. Perhaps the student is having difficulty making the
transition from the relaxed atmosphere of early grades _ naps,
beanbag chairs and relative freedom _ to the more structured higher
grades, sitting at desks in rows.
</P>
<P>
   Social changes also may be a factor. One year a child may be the
most popular student in class; the next, she's not. Suddenly she's
stomping home, hurling her books across the room, yelling, ``I hate
Mrs. Frattlethrap!''
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be the teacher is a bad teacher, or it may be as simple
as a problem on the bus on the way to school,'' Callahan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A common complaint you hear from kids is that my teacher yells
at me,'' said Caroline Butler, a member of the board of directors
of the National Parent Teachers Association and principal at Maple
Wood Elementary School in Somersworth, N.H. ``But a child's
definition of yell is often different from what an adult says is
yell. What a child may mean is, `My teacher corrected me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But if, after some Holmesian sleuthing _ ``It's elementary
school, my dear Watson'' _ parents are convinced that a
teacher-student problem really exists, they should act.
</P>
<P>
   Creative listening
</P>
<P>
   First, parents may observe one or more classes to see if their
child's complaints are borne out. For instance, parents may find a
``strict'' teacher is simply demanding intellectual rigor.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a child may perceive as mean or tough may actually be a
teacher who, in retrospect, they think, `You know, she really
taught me something. She had a disciplined class, held us to the
curriculum, held us to high standards and it paid off in the end,'
'' said Janet Bass, spokeswoman for the American Federation of
Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Next, parents might set up a parent-teacher conference. ``And,
for at least part of that,'' Butler recommended, ``include the
child. Have a three-way conversation, or four-way, if both parents
are there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an incident in the middle of the year,'' she recalled,
``where we all sat down together in an environment that was not
threatening. We soon figured out the problem _ the child and
teacher were not understanding what each other was saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is real important for the parent to go in and say,
`This is what my child is saying, and how can we work together to
make my child feel more comfortable in school.' If parents and
teachers can really listen to each other and not threaten each
other, things can be resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Callahan concurred. If there's one thing parents don't want to
do it's stampede into a teacher's room with accusations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never go to school saying to a teacher, `You're wrong,' or,
`You're doing something inappropriate,' '' she said. ``Put the
teacher on the defensive and all you'll get is a defensive
response.''
</P>
<P>
   The best course, Callahan said, is to be honest and reasonable.
Express your child's feelings, misgivings or the situation as best
you know them, then ask how you and the teacher can work together
to solve them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing to do,'' Callahan added, ``is to say, `These are the
things that are making my child uncomfortable. She really likes
school. She loves to learn. But she doesn't learn well when she
doesn't have the opportunity to talk to other people. How can we
make it more comfortable for her to learn here? We have the same
goals. How can I help support you in what you do?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Often, that should be enough. ``I think in 97 percent of cases,
opening the lines of communication _ when everybody is listening to
each other _ truly takes care of the problem,'' Butler said.
</P>
<P>
   But not always.
</P>
<P>
   To the top
</P>
<P>
   ``If the teacher says, `These are my rules. This is the way I
run my classroom. And that's that,' '' Callahan said, ``then you go
to the principal's office.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, rather than arriving armed with anger and accusations _
``I'd be very careful not to say, `This is a bad teacher,' ''
Callahan advised _ come prepared with solid examples documenting
your child's concerns and what's keeping her from learning in this
classroom. Examples:
</P>
<P>
   - For two months the teacher has given only workbook
assignments.
</P>
<P>
   - Your child needs more structure; the class is very free.
</P>
<P>
   - Your child thrives with freedom; the teacher is very
regimented.
</P>
<P>
   - You've spoken to parents A, B and C and students X, Y and Z,
who all have concerns about the teacher's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   - You've spoken with the teacher, who seems unwilling to work
with you.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, Butler said, parents should expect most principals to
act conservatively. It's the rare administrator who will
immediately switch a student from one classroom to another. And the
reason may have little to do withthe teacher.
</P>
<P>
   There may be no room in other classes. The principal may be
concerned about taking a student out of class where he or she has
good friends; such a switch may do more harm than good. Sometimes
the principal is in a sensitive situation because nobody wants
their child in that classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say you can't get your child moved. You've gone up and
down the line and this is where your child is,'' Callahan said.
``You can do two things.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, you tell your child that life isn't always fair.
Sometimes it is grossly unfair. I have bosses I don't like. But as
long as your child is not in any physical or mental danger, he'll
probably be OK. Kids adapt and they're resilient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Second: You, at home, begin to intervene in the learning
process. `Tell me what you've learned in school today. Tell me what
you did in math today.' You say, `I can help you make school fun,
even if this is not the best teacher you have ever had.' Then you
make it interesting by the things you do at home.''
</P>
<P>
   If the child's studying the Civil War, for example, take her to
a local battle re-enactment. Go to the library. Get books, videos,
educational computer games.
</P>
<P>
   After school, help the student concentrate on the positive
aspects of class, with questions such as, ``What was the best thing
your teacher did today?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea,'' Callahan said, ``is to turn the attention from the
negatives to the positives in the classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is no law that a child has to remain with any
one teacher. Parents pay for schools with either taxes or tuition
and, if they choose, can insist their child be moved from a
classroom. Although it may require going from teacher to principal
to school superintendent, in the end school officials will comply.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can insist,'' Butler said. ``But you really need to look
at the child and you need to go in and observe. If every other
child in a classroom is happy and smiling and seems to be having a
wonderful time, and your child is not, then what is the situation?
It's knowing the child.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidebar What mean really means
</P>
<P>
   If a child is having problems with a teacher, educators say,
parents must dig for the facts by asking the child specific
questions, such as:
</P>
<P>
   - Exactly what about your teacher is ``mean''?
</P>
<P>
   - When does she yell at you?
</P>
<P>
   - Why don't you think your teacher likes you? What gives you
that feeling?
</P>
<P>
   - Did she say she doesn't like you?
</P>
<P>
   - Does your teacher yell at you every day?
</P>
<P>
   - Does she yell at other kids?
</P>
<P>
   After sifting through sundry monosyllabic answers or floods of
emotional verbiage, parents should be able to uncover some truths.
Maybe the teacher was in a bad mood. Maybe she was dealing with an
unruly class.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe _ gasp! _ your child actually did something to merit
the teacher's reaction. _ Eric Adler, staff writer

   (Undated) _ A new shop op ...
</P>
<P>
   Posing before a full-length mirror in a comfortable dressing
room trying on clothes in an adult, slightly narcissistic version
of playing dress-up has appeal indeed. But when you're short on
time, charming environments or parking, there are alternative
opportunities, such as the Internet, shopping networks and catalogs
such as the new Macy's by Mail.
</P>
<P>
   The 118-page book, offering fashion and home products, was
mailed to 2 million homes last week. Some 10 million will go out
this fall. From the noted New York-based department store chain, it
includes merchandise from the likes of Tommy Hilfiger, Liz
Claiborne and Ralph Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically it comes at a time when business is soft for some of
the biggest catalog companies such as Spiegel and J. Crew,
according to trade journal Women's Wear Daily. But Macy's is
projecting $250 million in catalog sales in five years.
</P>
<P>
   To request a catalog or place an order, call 800-431-9644.
</P>
<P>
   Where to go
</P>
<P>
   On West Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, you can buy vintage
clothing in a store called Come to Mamma. Vacation in New York and
visit Cheap Jack's on lower Broadway for 15,000 square feet of
apparel dating back to the 1800s. Buy consignment celebrity clothes
at Encore uptown on Madison Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   So goes the information you'll find in The Ultimate Consignment
and Thrift Store Guide, (Consignment and Thrift Store Publishing,
$16.95), by Carolyn Schneider.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a dedicated scavenger of old and recently new, you may
know the best sources in your neighborhood but not in other cities.
The book does not list every store, but it gives you a start in
such places as Honolulu and Nashville, Tenn. It's available in
major bookstores or check into www.consignmentguide.com.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the Old Spice?
</P>
<P>
   What's sexy? InStyle magazine asked several hundred women
readers between ages 18 to 49, and in the clothes department the
consensus was _ tah-dah! _ simple jeans and a T-shirt on a woman.
Khakis and an untucked oxford shirt took the title for men. And as
for the sexiest fragrance? Ordinary soap.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-three percent thought short hair on women sexy. Forty-five
percent felt a tug at long hair on men.
</P>
<P>
   Among the celebrities, Nicole Kidman picked humor as the
ultimate in sexy. And Natasha Richardson's choice was kitchen
tables, a reminder of ``sex and food,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The eyes have it
</P>
<P>
   The high funnel and turtleneck sweaters so fashionable this fall
require some fresh thinking about makeup, says Dick Page, the New
York-based makeup artist whose recent credits include Calvin Klein,
Michael Kors and Narcisco Rodriguez shows. In the August Vogue, he
advises women to play up the eyes and minimize lips so as not to
look constricted (it may also hold down the lipstick on the
collar).
</P>
<P>
   Some other tips:
</P>
<P>
   - Thin brows make people look startled. And brows should have a
little shine.
</P>
<P>
   - Skip Botox injections that freeze the face. ``Don't be afraid
of the way your face moves,'' Page says. Animated faces are more
interesting.

CONWAY COMPETING WITH HALL FOR JET JOB 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Brett Conway took to the practice field as a
Jet for the first time Saturday, exuding confidence. But John Hall,
who once seemed to be the team's kicker for the new millennium,
seemed to be distracted.
</P>
<P>
   Conway became a Jet on Friday after Hall produced a disastrous
performance against the Giants on Thursday night: three straight
squib kickoffs, a missed extra point, a blown 37-yard field goal
that went so far left, it looked like a foul pop into the
third-base seats.
</P>
<P>
   Hall is still a Jet, but Conway will handle all the kicks during
Friday night's preseason finale at Chicago. Hall will essentially
have to not merely boot the ball into the end zone consistently,
but also show coach Bill Parcells he can be successful on 75
percent of his field-goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Conway was one of the best kickers in college during his Penn
State career. His final boot for Penn State came in the closing
seconds against Michigan State in 1996 and lifted the Nittany Lions
into the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been reading that a lot of people think he's got a
stronger leg,'' Conway said when asked about Hall. ``We'll see. I
had five preseason kickoffs and three were touchbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall, meanwhile, declined to meet with members of the news media
Saturday. As he entered the cafeteria at Hofstra University, he was
swinging a key chain. When he saw a clutch of reporters gathered on
the other side of the automatic doors, he began to nervously swing
the chain furiously. The doors closed on him as he went through
them. He was unhurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about anything,'' Hall said of the kicking
situation.
</P>
<P>
   He then said he would be back for interviews after lunch.
Instead, he left through a back door.
</P>
<P>
   Conway's route from Green Bay to the Jets isn't so surprising
considering that the Jets and the Packers have been involved in two
other trades in the last year. The Packers' general manager, Ron
Wolf, and Parcells are not only longtime admirers of each other's
football acumen, but also neighbors in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   And Parcells rated Conway as the best college football kicker
available in last year's draft. Wolf, however, drafted him in the
third round.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pretty much handed me the job last year,'' Conway said.
``Drafting a guy in the third round and not signing your kicker of
eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pack had dropped Chris Jacke. But Conway suffered a
quadriceps injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never got back on track,'' he said. ``I kicked too much the
next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Longwell became the Packers' kicker and Conway sat out the
season. In this year's camp, Conway said, ``the last couple of
weeks I was kicking really well.''
</P>
<P>
   But he could not unseat Longwell. ``I don't look at it as not
making the Packers,'' Conway said. ``They were going to get a draft
choice for either one of us, whoever they traded.''
</P>
<P>
   Conway will be working with an inexperienced snapper, punter
Nick Gallery, as was Hall. Gallery replaced Brian Hansen, who was
traded to the Packers last Monday. When Hansen held for Hall last
year, the kicker was successful on 27 of 36 field-goal attempts _
or 75 percent. But when quarterback Glenn Foley held, Hall was a 20
percent kicker, hitting only one of five field goals.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Green Bay, Conway had a conversation with Wolf
about Parcells. Then the kicker met the Jets coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You've heard stories about me, I'm sure,''' Conway
said, adding that he replied, ``Yes, sir, I have.''

BULLETIN: POPEYE SPIKES HIS SPINACH 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The long batting practice home runs soar like golf balls and
elicit the reactions to a Fourth of July fireworks display. One
after another, on his first 11 swings at Shea Stadium Friday night.
The Mark McGwire Over America's Fences tour is deep into its fifth
month, about to begin a historic last lap. But here, suddenly,
comes the potentially myth-debunking news that Popeye supplements
his spinach with a testosterone-producing pill.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire says he has been taking an over-the-counter substance
called androstenedione that is banned in some sports, and now that
this little-secret-he-apparently-wasn't-hiding has come out, what
are we supposed to make of the fact that there is artificial
flavoring inside the Natural?
</P>
<P>
   How do we respond to the report that McGwire uses a substance
doctors say is the equivalent of a steroid?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody I know in the game of baseball uses the same stuff I
use,'' McGwire told The Associated Press after acknowledging he has
_ he says for about a year _ been taking androstenedione, as well
as creatine, the more commonly used muscle builder. If he's right,
could it be that it's the bodies, not the balls, that are juiced?
</P>
<P>
   For the record, McGwire is the only player admitting to using
androstenedione. He has also broken no laws, no baseball rules, and
it is not as if he was some slap-hitting wimp at any point in his
career. He hit 49 home runs as a rookie in 1987. He has for years
been a pregame spectacle. I remember watching him and Jose Canseco
play Top This in batting practice a decade ago when the A's were in
Boston and thinking it was one of the best shows in sports.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there were those two strike- and injury-shortened
seasons in 1994 and 1995 when McGwire hit a combined 18 home runs
in 151 games, when he seemed on an inevitable slide, in need of
some career pick-me-up. Since he has passed 30 years of age, he has
gone straight to home run heaven, from 39 to 52 to 58 to 51 and
counting.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Cardinals' slugger has officially announced that
Roger Maris has been put on notice, the dissection of McGwire will
begin in earnest. Which of the global media conglomerates will be
first on the air with the McGwire Channel? All Mark, all the time.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets drew close to 100,000 for consecutive doubleheaders
with McGwire's Cardinals. The majority weren't there for the
wild-card race, or to boo Mike Piazza. At Shea Friday night, there
was an explosion of flash photography on every pitch to McGwire,
the first time I have seen that for an athlete not named Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Pirates have sold out regular-season consecutive dates
this weekend at Pittsburgh's typically roomy Three Rivers Stadium
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   If McGwire thought the attention was annoying these last five
months, he should know that the Monica Network is about to suffer a
serious ratings decline and upon his sturdy shoulders will the
country's news media take its Indian Summer ride. McGwire should be
rooting hard for Sammy Sosa to stay with him, though that will only
be temporary relief, the equivalent of a commercial break, from
what he is going to face.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been this way in Houston, Colorado, Chicago,'' Cardinals
Manager Tony LaRussa said, soaking in Friday night's batting
practice hysteria. ``Unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course we would all like to believe that Paul Bunyan has no
chemical charge, the way we assume his bat has no hollow center
filled with cork. So how do we deal with an issue that has been
dutifully avoided as McGwire mounted his home run assault with a
body that vaguely resembles the one he once had? It is easy for
sports journalists to condemn a cheat like Ben Johnson, or ridicule
the dirty cyclists in the Tour de France. This is baseball, not a
sport we visit every few years, and this home run quest is one that
reaches deep into our childhood souls.
</P>
<P>
   Forget for a moment that leaderless baseball hasn't banned this
substance the way the National Football League and the Olympics
have. When the shot-putter Randy Barnes is found to have used the
very same substance and is banned by his sport, we are dismayed
because he betrayed the spirit of fair competition. Athletes like
Barnes make us ask a question that John Lucas, basketball's drug
mentor, raised when we spoke recently about the current enhancement
rage in sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do we know,'' Lucas said, ``if we are watching the athlete
or the drug?''
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to question whether McGwire would be closing in on
Maris without his bottled helpers. But if we're going to direct
them at easier targets, at athletes in sports we don't care too
much about, then, yes, there ought to at least be debate about Mark
McGwire, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, if there's more research and it's shown that it's
harmful, we'll make people aware,'' a baseball spokesman, Rich
Levin, told The Associated Press, referring to androstenedione.
</P>
<P>
   It would be something it if were one day banned, and became an
asterisk to McGwire's home run record. &QL;

EXPERTS: LOSERS IN CLINTON-STARR BOUTS MIGHT BE FUTURE PRESIDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS 18th graf, `The court ..., and last graf to ADD dropped words
in quotes.) 
 (nk) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's defense of his private conduct
this year has endangered more than his reputation and credibility.
The legal battles he has fought to avoid acknowledging that his
behavior with Monica Lewinsky was inappropriate may have eroded
presidential power and prerogatives for future presidents, legal
experts, constitutional scholars and political scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   The precedents set by court decisions rebuffing Clinton's
efforts to halt a sexual misconduct suit by Paula Jones and prevent
close aides and bodyguards from testifying before a federal grand
jury investigating the Lewinsky matter have profound implications,
experts say. Among them are these:
</P>
<P>
   _ Presidents can now be sued for private conduct while still in
office.
</P>
<P>
   _ Government lawyers may be compelled to disclose advice they
provide to presidents.
</P>
<P>
   _ The notion that executive privilege protects a president's
conversation with his advisers has been restricted.
</P>
<P>
   _ Members of a president's personal security force can be called
to testify about his or her movements, actions and habits.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton voluntarily set a precedent, as the first president
to testify before a grand jury investigating his own actions. One
potential battle, over whether a prosecutor can require a president
to appear by issuing a subpoena, was avoided _ at least for now _
when Clinton agreed to testify. But Starr has told the president
that he still might subpoena him to compel testimony about matters
Clinton declined to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   Not lost on students of the presidency is that these legal
precedents did not flow out of Clinton's efforts to protect
conversations involving national security or sensitive
law-enforcement or economic policy. They resulted from the
president's effort to hide an affair with Ms. Lewinsky that he
later acknowledged. Executive privilege protects conversations
about sensitive government matters between the president and top
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, many of those who ponder the impact on the institution fear
serious consequences, including the potential for more lawsuits
against presidents in office, an inhibition to give presidents
candid advice, a disinclination to write memorandums or diaries,
and difficulty recruiting quality advisers because of the risk of
large legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just been a disaster for the presidency,'' said Harold
Bruff, dean of the University of Colorado Law School.
</P>
<P>
   The president's legal battles continue. The White House asked
the Supreme Court on Friday to overturn a lower court ruling
requiring that some of Clinton's legal advisers testify in the
Lewinsky case.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Rozell, a political science professor at the University of
Pennsylvania and an expert on executive privilege, said: ``I think
much of the Clinton strategy has weakened traditional presidential
power with respect to executive privilege. In part, that's because
they have sent up losing argument after losing argument for what
appears to me to be attempts to delay the Starr investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone lays the blame for erosion of presidential power at
the feet of the Clinton White House. Several scholars and lawyers
also fault Starr for disregarding potential damage to the
presidency in his aggressive pursuit of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Though concepts like executive privilege and attorney-client
confidentiality, which protects conversations between lawyers and
their clients, often have an abstract or theoretical air to the
public, the loss of these prerogatives to presidents can have real
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say the erosion of such powers may make it harder,
for example, for presidents to recruit competent and trusted
advisers. A host of Clinton advisers have been subpoenaed by Starr
and appeared before grand juries investigating accusations of
presidential misconduct, even conduct that took place before the
president was elected. Most have had to pay their own legal bills.
</P>
<P>
   Bruff said he once turned down a job in the White House
counsel's office. ``One of the reasons for rejecting it,'' he said,
``was that I can't risk my family's life savings for potential
legal bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Some lawyers also lament the Supreme Court decision in the Jones
lawsuit that permitted sitting presidents to be sued, a precedent
some consider potentially damaging.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court assumed that because there were so few civil suits
against the president in the past, that there would not be many
such suits in the future,'' said Walter Dellinger, a Duke
University Law School professor and former Solicitor General. ``But
the future is a different world, because no litigant will ever have
to go to the Supreme Court again to commence a lawsuit against the
president of the United States. All a litigant has to do is file
suit in any federal or state court.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones' lawyers, among others, say the case reached the High
Court only because Clinton declined to settle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no real desire on their part to settle; they wanted
to wait until the Supreme Court finished,'' said Joseph Cammarata,
one of Mrs. Jones' lawyers at the time. Robert Bennett, Clinton's
lawyer in the Jones case, did not return a telephone call.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some scholars dismiss the notion of any permanent damage to the
presidency and dispute assertions that court decisions will
constrain presidents from confiding in advisers. What is there to
fear, they say, as long as discussions do not involve illegal acts
or abuse of power?
</P>
<P>
   Charles Jones, professor emeritus of political science at the
University of Wisconsin, also does not buy the argument that
compelling the president's bodyguards to testify will mean that he
will seek to avoid them as much as possible. ``Why would he place
his life in jeopardy?'' Jones asked.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of presidential prerogatives is an elastic one,
scholars say. It is not mentioned in the Constitution and is mainly
defined by case law and by whether a president feels confident that
if he asserts it, he will not pay a political price.
</P>
<P>
   It is the latter area, some experts say, where the Clinton
administration has done the most harm, by making it likely that
future presidents will be more hesitant to evoke a principle of
prerogative like executive privilege for fear of political
accusations that they are trying to hide questionable actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it turns out that the president was only covering up his
own embarrassment, it becomes easy for people to say, this wasn't
about principle at all,'' said Peter Shane, a professor at the
University of Pittsburgh Law School who is a former Justice
Department lawyer. ``Now when the next president comes along and
tries to do the same, politically it becomes much harder. People
are going to say, `Wait a minute, this is just another
stonewall.''' &QL;

DODGERS BEGIN LONG, HARD SEARCH FOR NEW GM 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   All the Fox horses and all the Fox men could not make the
Dodgers a contender again, so now they have begun the search for a
general manager who can.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Lasorda will not be the man. The interim general manager
since the dismissal of Fred Claire two months ago, Lasorda said the
trades the Dodgers made would gain them a playoff spot. But there
will be no October baseball games in Los Angeles this year.
</P>
<P>
   Not that his failure to make good on his promise is the reason
Lasorda is not a candidate. Interim, in this instance, really meant
interim.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're identifying everyone in the industry who I think is
capable of being a general manager and identifying those people who
are available and requesting permission from their clubs to speak
to those people,'' said Dodgers president Bob Graziano.
</P>
<P>
   A Dodgers search for a general manager does not resemble, say, a
Yankees search for a general manager. There is something about the
frequency that is different.
</P>
<P>
   Under George Steinbrenner, the Yankees have had 15 men serve as
general manager, some of them twice. In nearly 30 years, dating to
December 1968, four years before Steinbrenner and partners bought
the Yankees, the Dodgers had only two general managers before the
June move _ Claire and Al Campanis, who lost his job in April 1987
because of unfortunate remarks about the capabilities of blacks in
management positions.
</P>
<P>
   And when the Dodgers jettisoned Campanis as the politically
correct move to make, they did not have to search for a successor
because Claire was already there.
</P>
<P>
   Now Dave Dombrowski, Jim Bowden, Bob Watson, Omar Minaya, Dean
Taylor and Kevin Malone are the names on the Dodgers' list of
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Dombrowski, the Florida Marlins' general manager, would seem to
be the most logical leading choice. He has the most experience in
the job, put together a World Series champion and has a contract
that expires this year. But he will also be coveted by other teams
seeking a new general manager and a new direction, and the word
among executives of other clubs is that Dombrowski would prefer the
Colorado job, assuming it becomes available.
</P>
<P>
   Dombrowski may also be reluctant to go into a situation where
Lasorda will still be lurking. Graziano said that Lasorda would not
conflict with the new general manager but that Lasorda's role had
not been ``clearly defined.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll most definitely have a role in the organization,''
Graziano said. ``I think that will develop as we determine whom
we're hiring and the strengths of the person we're hiring and his
experience. Tommy has a lot of strengths, and I hope to use those
strengths in the future. But the person we're hiring will be the
general manager, no question about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda is nevertheless joining Graziano and Peter O'Malley, the
former owner and still chairman, in interviewing candidates, none
of whom Graziano would discuss.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, the Cincinnati general manager, has a year left on his
contract. Watson, badly in need of a rest and liberation from
Steinbrenner, remains under contract to the Yankees and is not
certain Steinbrenner will give the Dodgers permission to talk to
him.
</P>
<P>
   Malone is the assistant general manager in Baltimore with a
previous term as the general manager in Montreal. Minaya, with the
Mets, and Taylor, with Atlanta, are assistant general managers who
the Dodgers feel could be ready to assume the No. 1 position.
Minaya is the highest-ranking Hispanic official in the major
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the same names will surface in the search by other teams
for general managers. Some executives believe as many as nine or 10
teams could make changes after this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking for someone who can lead the entire baseball
operation,'' Graziano said, ``someone with a background in
scouting, knowledge of the major leagues and minor leagues, and can
really pull all of our baseball operations together and come up
with the right strategic plan for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Graziano says he has set no deadline for hiring someone, but his
goal is to have a new general manager going into the off season.
For the Dodgers, the off season begins Sept. 28. &QL;

GORDON'S RELENTLESS WINNING A PROBLEM FOR NASCAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRISTOL, Tenn. _ Without a doubt, Jeff Gordon is the driver to
beat this season. But whether his weekly dominance is good or bad
for NASCAR has been the subject of some lively debate.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR's goal is to have a racing series that does not favor a
particular team, driver or make of car. So if the racing surface is
level, and the series' strict rules are enforced, every car should
have as good a chance to win as any other.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks, one team, Gordon's DuPont-backed No. 24
Chevrolet Monte Carlo, has driven away from the competition. And
that has been raising eyebrows in garages and grandstands around
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they want someone winning too much,'' Gordon
said Friday before qualifying for Saturday night's Goody 500,
referring to NASCAR's desire for a variety of winners. ``This sport
is about being as equal as they can possibly get the cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who has won eight races this year, including the last
four in a row, attributes much of his success to having a good
rapport with his crew chief, Ray Evernham, who has made several
great late-in-the-race calls in the pits.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon and Evernham talk before, during and after races, trying
to get the car just right.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that they can't put a template on, one thing they
can't control, is the people,'' Gordon said. ``The driver-crew
chief combination, the pit crew combination. NASCAR knows it's
doing everything it can to make sure everything is equal, but they
can't control how well these people work.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASCAR wants to see every possible car out there win every
season, but that's not possible,'' he said. ``I'm sure there's a
point where too much dominance is not good, but a certain amount of
it is not bad.''
</P>
<P>
   A growing majority of fans voice their displeasure with Gordon's
weekly domination, booing him before and after every race. Because
when Gordon wins, 42 other drivers _ many of whom are admired by
these fans _ lose.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Helton, the director of competition for NASCAR, said: ``At
the end of the day, it's more important to us that the second-place
car is close enough to him to put on a good show. Right now, they
are not as close as we would like them to be, but it will take care
of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer Planning Return
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Spencer, who sustained a severe concussion in a wreck at
the Brickyard 400 last month, expects to return for next weekend's
race at New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer, the driver of the No. 23 Winston car, started the race
three weeks ago at Watkins Glen, but was relieved by the backup
driver, Boris Said, on the 10th lap. Days later, Spencer announced
that he would skip the next two races (Michigan and Bristol)
because the injury was more serious than believed initially.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thinks they know more than the doctor,'' Spencer
said. ``I regret ever getting in the car.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer was cleared to return for Saturday night's race at
Bristol, but he said there was some concern that he might struggle
with dizziness caused by the sharp banked turns of the half-mile
track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I took the time off,'' Spencer said. ``I didn't think
it would have been a wise decision to jeopardize the team or the
other drivers. There's a lot of pressure from sponsors, fans and
your own team, but it was something I needed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer's best finish in a points race this season was second at
Talladega in the Diehard 500. He is 14th in the Winston Cup
championship points race.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin Leading Rookie
</P>
<P>
   One year after taking rookie-of-the-year honors in the NASCAR
Craftsman Truck Series, Kenny Irwin is again the fastest first-year
driver on the track.
</P>
<P>
   This season, however, Irwin is leading the Winston Cup rookie
points standing, a prestigious award won by many of the sport's
best drivers. Should he hold on to his comfortable lead, Irwin will
join the likes of Richard Petty, Jeff Gordon, Rusty Wallace and
Dale Earnhardt in having captured the award.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin, who drives the No. 28 Texaco Ford, has one top-five
(fifth at Atlanta) and three top-10 finishes this season.
</P>
<P>
   Unleaded Fuel Test
</P>
<P>
   Even in this day of environmental consciousness, it came as
somewhat of a surprise when the NASCAR Busch Series driver Elton
Sawyer tested a car at Charlotte last week running on unleaded
fuel. Except for opening the carburetor slightly, there were no
modifications made to the engine. Sawyer's crew simply emptied out
the 110 octane leaded gas used now by NASCAR and filled the tank
with a special Unocal unleaded gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything went well; we did not experience any problems as
far as torque,'' Sawyer said. ``It drove the same, ran the same.
The only concern Unocal had was to make sure there wasn't any
extensive wear in the engine.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first serious test of unleaded fuel to be used for
racing, and there are going to be several more test runs, according
to NASCAR, before a decision will be made on whether it is a viable
option.

CLINTON SWEARS TO USE `ALL TOOLS' AGAINST TERRORISM 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Adds Sudanese avowal of retaliation, details of bin Laden's funds
and U.S. efforts to freeze them, and info. on missile damage.)   (js) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton vowed Saturday that the United
States would use ``all the tools at our disposal'' to fight the
terrorist network of Osama bin Laden, as the administration
outlined efforts to squeeze him financially following the U.S.
cruise-missile strikes Thursday in Afghanistan and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our efforts against terrorism cannot and will not end with
this strike,'' Clinton declared in his weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
   As he vacationed with his family in Martha's Vineyard, Clinton
announced that he had signed an executive order, effective a day
earlier, that asks the Treasury Department to block any financial
transactions with U.S. companies by bin Laden, two of his
lieutenants and what the U.S. says is his principal terrorist
organization, the Islamic Army.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 48 hours after the United States attacked a
pharmaceutical factory in Sudan and a training camp in Afghanistan
with roughly 75 cruise missiles, the administration also provided
more detail on the damage it said was done to bin Laden's network.
</P>
<P>
   A day after cloudy weather partly obscured the extent of the
damage in Afghanistan, the president's spokesman, Michael McCurry,
said Saturday that satellite photographs showed the strike hit all
six separate sites within the sprawling training camp, located in a
remote, mountainous area about 90 miles south of the capital,
Kabul.
</P>
<P>
   A full assessment could take more time, but McCurry, sticking to
the measured claims of the day after the attack, said the strike
had caused ``moderate to severe'' damage to the site's barracks,
ammunition depots and other facilities. Bin Laden has used the camp
in the past, but his whereabouts remained unclear on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have severely damaged the ability of the Osama bin Laden
network to operate from these camps,'' McCurry said, speaking to
reporters on Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, a Saudi exile accused of underwriting attacks by
terrorist groups around the world, is believed to have an inherited
fortune exceeding $200 million invested in a network of
argricultural, construction and financial companies that, officials
say, helps pay for and conceal terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
   The president's order, which he signed only hours after the U.S.
strikes, places bin Laden and his associates on a list of
terrorists monitored by the Treasury Department. The order
prohibits all Americans and U.S. companies from having any
financial transactions with them, including business and
fund-raising. The order also requires banks to freeze any assets
found to belong to them.
</P>
<P>
   The effort is not likely to have a significant impact on bin
Laden's financial empire because, a senior administration official
said, he does not appear to have many assets that would fall under
the scope of the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would not expect this single step to cripple this network
any more than we would expect a single military action in Khost, in
Afghanistan, to cripple this network,'' the official said. But the
official said the administration hoped the formal legal step would
prompt other countries to help freeze bin Laden's assets. In his
address, the president called for precisely that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes money _ lots of it _ to build the network bin Laden
has,'' Clinton said. ``We'll do our best to see that he has less of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the world, the fallout from the bombing continued. The
Arab League announced Saturday that it would hold a meeting in
Cairo on Monday to coordinate support for Sudan. In Khartoum, the
capital of Sudan, another day of protests began on Saturday.
President Omar Hassan al-Bashir pledged to retaliate for the
destruction of a pharmaceutical factory that, U.S. officials
maintained, produced material for chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Washington, lawmakers rallied around the president.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., expressed strong support for
Clinton's efforts. ``The president deserves our support for acting
swiftly and decisively,'' McCain said in the Republican Party's
weekly radio address. ``The military strikes he ordered against
targets in Afghanistan and Sudan were appropriate. America's armed
forces carried out their mission with skill and professionalism.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's senior national security advisers _ Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and Secretary of Defense William Cohen _
went to Capitol Hill to build support for the strikes. In a
classified briefing on Friday, they also laid out the evidence the
administration says links Bin Laden to terrorist attacks, including
the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Aug. 7,
which killed 263 people, including 12 Americans.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sen. Dan Coats, a Republican from Indiana who had sharply
questioned the timing of the strikes given the controversy over
Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky, emerged from Friday's
meeting softening his remarks. ``There does appear to be credible
evidence to suggest that targeting an Osama bin Laden terrorist
training site was necessary,'' Coats said.
</P>
<P>
   However, he went on to say that Clinton's behavior had made
skepticism about motives and timing of the missile strikes
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the president's private scandal that is leading to the
public's skepticism,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his radio address, Clinton thanked congressional leaders for
offering bipartisan support for the attacks. He said the United
States had ``compelling evidence'' that bin Laden's network ``was
poised to strike at us again _ and soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton emphasized that Islam and its adherents were not the
threat, trying to draw distinctions between the Islamic world in
general and what he called ``a callous, criminal organization.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hundreds of millions of Muslims all over the world _ including
millions right here in the United States _ oppose terrorism and
deplore the twisting of their religious teachings into
justification of inhumane, indeed, ungodly acts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he vowed to press the fight, Clinton, echoing similar
remarks by Albright and other aides, grimly suggested that
Thursday's strikes, however effective, were not likely to put an
end to bin Laden's self-proclaimed war on the United States and
U.S. interests. ``We should have realistic expectations about what
a single action can achieve,'' he said. ``And we must be prepared
for a long battle.'' &QL;

   EDGARTOWN, Mass. _ Some vacation.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton fled Washington on Tuesday after the most
excruciating day of his public life, seeking solace and solitude on
Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of the relaxation he had found on previous summer
vacations on the island, this time he confronted the unpleasant job
of trying to repair the damage done to his marriage by his now
painfully public affair with a young White House intern. His staff
in Washington was trying to find a way to heal the breach of trust
with the public from his Monday night revelations. And the opinion
industry was debating whether Clinton was the first figure in
history to try to obstruct justice with a necktie.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the small hours of Thursday morning, he gave the final
order to launch 75 cruise missiles against terrorist targets in the
Sudan and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   President once again, and not just the prodigal husband in the
doghouse and supplicant for national absolution, Clinton donned a
deep blue suit and flew back to Washington to oversee the aftermath
of the attacks. He could concentrate on bomb damage assessment
rather than on personal and political damage control.
</P>
<P>
   The President Is `Pooped'
</P>
<P>
   Clinton returned to the Vineyard on Friday night, spent a quiet
evening at home and slept late Saturday. The president is
``pooped,'' said White House press secretary Mike McCurry. ``He's
had a long week.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for a quiet birthday dinner with Vernon Jordan and his
wife, Ann, on Wednesday, the Clintons have not ventured from their
borrowed estate on Oyster Pond on the south shore of the island. No
golf, no sailing, no parties, no Kennedys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president had a very busy week and a somewhat stressful
week,'' McCurry said Saturday. ``He's had a lot on his mind this
week on multiple fronts. Today is the day he's finally doing what
he came up here to do, which is relax and enjoy himself a bit. He
is definitely in vacation mode.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the family fence-mending that is on the president's
agenda for this vacation, McCurry said, ``he is working at it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is they still have work to do,'' McCurry said. But,
he added, ``they are doing it in private and I'm not going to give
you a play-by-play account.''
</P>
<P>
   First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was described by friends as
embarrassed and humiliated by her husband's extracurricular
behavior and the damage he has done to his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   No one outside the family really knows what is going on inside
the walls of the summer White House.
</P>
<P>
   But a close friend of the president's who has witnessed previous
family crises said that the family's ``healing'' is a quiet affair,
with a somewhat sheepish president and a frosty first lady warily
circling each other waiting for an opportunity to engage. As the
Clintons left the White House on Tuesday, their daughter, Chelsea,
walked between her father and mother, holding each by the hand.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated in the Vineyard
</P>
<P>
   In his address Monday night, Clinton said he was ``prepared to
do whatever it takes'' to atone to his family. It is not yet known
what that will be, but the early evidence is that Clinton is being
kept on a tight leash on the island.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent summer residents who have socialized with the Clintons
in past summers have not yet heard from them and none will say they
are prepared to call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't sense there's a feeling among people that he's persona
non grata or a pariah or anything else,'' said Ron Rappaport, a
Vineyard native who has attended parties with the Clintons. ``I
think he's a welcome visitor who needs his vacation and needs his
space.''
</P>
<P>
   There may be a reason the Clintons have been reluctant to
venture out. Virtually everyone here with access to a word
processor and an op-ed page has hashed over the president's
behavior during the past seven months. Jules Feiffer, the
cartoonist who has skewered the president repeatedly this year,
doesn't expect to be invited to any events involving the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some strange reason,'' Feiffer said, ``he doesn't come
near me.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Dershowitz, lawyer and author, had the chutzpah to show up
at the airport to greet the Clintons on Tuesday, even though he has
second-guessed Clinton's response to the Starr investigation in
several opinion articles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there for one reason, to show I'm not a fair-weather
friend,'' Dershowitz said. ``I've been somewhat critical of the
president in print. I've not followed the White House line. I don't
think he should be impeached, but I don't agree with everything
he's done.''
</P>
<P>
   A Word in a Puzzle
</P>
<P>
   Given that kind of support, it's not surprising that Clinton is
laying low, reading thrillers and working crossword puzzles.
</P>
<P>
   But even the puzzles don't provide a complete respite. As
Clinton was flying to Martha's Vineyard on Tuesday doing the
crossword puzzle in The New York Times at warp speed, as is his
wont, he was stopped cold by clue 46 down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meal for the humble?'' read the clue, calling for a
four-letter answer.
</P>
<P>
   The president laughed ``in a bemused way,'' said an aide sitting
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's one appropriate for today,'' the president said, and
inked in the answer, ``Crow.''

flash point for a cultural clash over recreational and spiritual
use and the preservation and protection of priceless cave drawings
and archeological treasures dating back 12,000 years. According to
Kay Sutherland, an anthropology professor: ``It represents a sacred
place that was a crossroads or a confluence of a lot of cultures.
It is the Sistine Chapel of the Pueblo Indians. And Texas Parks and
Wildlife should pay homage to that. We should pay attention to
Native American voices and not disrespect their beliefs about it.''
But rock climbers and graffiti artists are destroying the artwork.
Use of the park will be restricted to guided tours starting Sept.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a Presidents' Day interview with C-Span in 1995,
Bill Clinton reflected with frustration on the spate of books and
biographies that were already presuming to chronicle a president
then barely two years in office, declaring: ``It's just crazy. I
mean, how can you possibly reflect on someone _ I mean, you know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't spend a lot of time reading them,'' Clinton continued
philosophically, ``just because I think that what I need to be
doing is, I need to focus on today and tomorrow. I can't do
anything about yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton has spent his whole life devouring biographies of
his predecessors, and he now has more yesterdays behind him in
office than he does tomorrows. After the most tumultuous week of
his presidency, capped by a dramatic strike on terrorist outposts
abroad, the question that haunts Clinton is how he will be judged
in light of the Monica Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   For a man who, friends say, values his legacy above all else,
Clinton has often seemed oddly heedless of the effect of the
actions that will ultimately compose it. At a minimum, it seems
safe to second the verdict of Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., who
said last week that ``Bill Clinton has probably assured himself to
be a controversial historic figure.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week's events also showed once again how hard it is to
fathom an ultimate answer, for less than 72 hours after his
humbling public confessional of an inappropriate relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky, Clinton was back in harness, vowing ``a long, ongoing
struggle between freedom and fanaticism, between the rule of law
and terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Wayne, a presidential historian at Georgetown
University, said, ``To some extent, he tends to focus best and most
like a laser as president when he's right on the brink of failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost as if he becomes careless, and then uses that
great skill and intellect to pull himself in line,'' Wayne said.
``This is a president who is going to be remembered as much for the
survival as he will for the scandal. That's a testament to his
skill in using the presidency to his advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   For some time, Clinton has hoped that foreign policy, which
daunted him early in his first term, could help redeem him in his
second, in part because a president has more room to maneuver
unilaterally and greater likelihood of bipartisan support. The
president's hand in the fragile Ireland peace effort, the
stabilization of Bosnia and his promised campaign against
international terrorism may yet come to seem among the most
substantial parts of his legacy. Ronald Reagan rebounded from the
depths of the Iran-Contra affair to the deeper rapprochement with
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev that cemented the end of the
Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took office five years and seven months ago with
sweeping goals, many of which, like overhauling the nation's
health-care system, fell victim to intense opposition and his own
over-reaching. Others, like reaching agreement to balance the
federal budget and passing a major restructuring of welfare,
succeeded beyond his doubters' imaginings as Clinton pursued a
synthetic style of politics that borrowed from and confounded both
parties.
</P>
<P>
   But now Clinton is at another dispiriting crossroads, his
dwindling tenure perforce limiting his power, and most of his hopes
for this year _ tobacco and campaign finance legislation and a
national discourse on race _ glimmering ever more faintly while the
Lewinsky matter stays in the spotlight. His job approval ratings
remain high, but his party's political prospects are uncertain this
fall, let alone two years from now, when he hopes the election of
Vice President Al Gore to the presidency can assure continuance of
his policies.
</P>
<P>
   Just a year after the White House and Congress reached peace
over the budget, the two sides are again headed toward a showdown
over taxes and spending. The administration has already issued
seven veto threats against spending bills that Congress must take
up when it returns from recess, seeking to restore financing for
programs Clinton favors or to delete language that would impose
ideological conditions. But the president may be forced to
compromise to avoid the appearance of inaction.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, Clinton will be operating with a demoralized staff
and a Cabinet whose own credibility he compromised by allowing them
to embrace his denials in the Lewinsky matter. In recent months,
some of the president's senior aides have taken to playing a
mordant game among themselves: imagining how their own obituaries
will reflect their service to a politician scarred by the Lewinsky
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What his legacy will consist of will depend, of course, on
who's deciding,'' said Alan Brinkley, a professor of history at
Columbia University whose work Clinton admires. ``All of these
scandals and embarrassments will be part of any account of his
presidency, but so will the things he's done that have not been
affected by that, including perhaps his reorientation of the
Democratic Party, which for better or worse is a very important
part of his presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, historians and politicians suggest that although
it is too early to put Clinton's legacy in perspective, it will
almost certainly rest principally on things he has already done,
because his current problems can only compound his natural
lame-duck status. Although the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll
last week found that 65 percent of Americans still approved of
Clinton's job performance, 60 percent also believed the Lewinsky
matter would have a serious effect on his administration over the
next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be careful with the institution of the
presidency,'' Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., who has never
shied from speaking his mind about Clinton, said in an interview in
the current issue of Playboy magazine, reflecting on the state of
Kenneth Starr's investigation into the Lewinsky matter. ``A wounded
president cannot govern well. I think we are being much too casual
about this matter. Even though he's a lame-duck president,
popularity and prestige can make him a formidable negotiator. But
if he's diminished, he will not have the influence he needs with
Congress. Legislators won't be afraid of him, won't want to help
resolve a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's best hopes for domestic achievements late in this term
have been overhauling Social Security and Medicare, tough tasks
that his advisers hoped he might elevate above partisan rancor with
no more elections of his own to face, but that will be much more
difficult in the bitter fallout from the Lewinsky case.
Congressional leaders of both parties have never especially trusted
Clinton, and the Republicans are now actively hostile and the
Democrats feeling betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was inevitable, regardless of what he did,'' as the
first Democratic president to face the challenge of rebuilding a
splintered party in the late 20th century, ``he would have
trouble,'' said Professor Joel Silbey, a Cornell University
historian. ``He is, after all, the first Democrat to say, `We have
to find another way,' and that does not lead to a great deal of
happiness about him or a great deal of memorable achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why, especially after the Republicans took control of
Congress in 1994, Clinton chose to stake so much of his presidency
on moderating the extremes of Republican proposals, defending the
poll-tested ``common ground'' of middle-of-the-road programs to
protect the environment, expand access to health care and promote
``values,'' like endorsing school uniforms and curfews for
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   It was during the shutdown of government in a standoff on the
budget in late 1995 that Clinton began to gain the upper hand in
arguments with the Republicans, and also, as the nation has since
learned, that he began what he has acknowledged to be an
inappropriate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Clinton has acknowledged deceiving the nation about
that relationship, his ability to articulate what was supposed to
be the major rhetorical theme of his second term _ healing the
partisan and personal differences of national life _ seems
irretrievably undercut.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot _ we will not _ succumb to the dark impulses that
lurk in the far regions of the soul, everywhere,'' Clinton said in
one passage of his second inaugural address that was meant to
describe racial divisions but now rings with unintended overtones.
``We shall overcome them, and we shall replace them with the
generous spirit of a people who feel at home with one another.''
</P>
<P>
   No less a moral philosopher than Clinton's Machiavellian former
strategist, Dick Morris, who was forced to resign on the day of the
president's renomination in 1996 after his relationship with a
prostitute became public, wrote recently of Clinton: ``Perhaps his
political power will return. But his moral authority is gone
forever.''

WOODSON COULD BE BIG DRAW FOR RAIDERS' FANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Oakland Raiders have a tradition of good defensive backs,
like the Hall of Famers Mike Haynes, the smash-mouth cornerback;
Jack Tatum, nicknamed Assassin, and Willie Brown, who scored on a
75-yard interception return in Super Bowl XI. While it is too early
to put the rookie corner Charles Woodson in that class, if his
preseason play is any indication, he is on his way.
</P>
<P>
   Woodson can be a savior to the team in several ways. He can be
the iron that the team's soft defense, constantly ranked among the
worst in recent years, has lacked. And the Raiders, once one of the
top draws in the National Football League, have not been able to
put people in the stands. So by helping the Raiders win games,
Woodson can also bring fans back to the team.
</P>
<P>
   Woodson has had a great training camp, but last week was his
coming-out party. Coach Jon Gruden raised some eyebrows on the
coaching staff when he decided to start Woodson against the Green
Bay Packers in a nationally televised game. The Packers have one of
the best offenses in the game, and starting a rookie against that
group is like throwing meat to the wolves.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out Gruden's decision was a smart one. In the first
quarter, Woodson made a jarring hit against wide receiver Antonio
Freeman that forced the ball loose. It was picked up by safety Eric
Turner, who returned it 35 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Later, quarterback Brett Favre threw Woodson's way once more,
and the ball bounced off Freeman's chest with Woodson hounding him.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders' defense caused three turnovers, and that was the
biggest reason Oakland won, 27-21, giving the Packers their first
loss at Lambeau Field since Sept. 17, 1995, a span of 33 games,
including five exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Raiders have needed a toughening of their
defense. Their offense has not been the problem, with the powerful
arm of Jeff George at the helm.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has been drafting top defenders and finding solid
defensive free agents, especially in the secondary. One of the most
valuable positions on the field is cornerback, and if you can find
a great one, it can free the rest of the defense to do other
things. Woodson is what the Raiders have wanted for years. They
tried with Larry Brown, the former Super Bowl most valuable player,
but that turned out to be an unmitigated disaster. He is now with
the Minnesota Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles is really aggressive and alert,'' said Raiders corner
Charles Allen, a six-time Pro Bowler. ``He doesn't seem like a
rookie. He already understands how offenses will try to attack
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Willie Shaw, Oakland's defensive coordinator, said, ``As far as
intelligence and feel for the game, he's probably ahead of most
rookies I've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week in practice, the Raiders got a major scare when
Woodson went down while backpedaling during a passing drill,
injuring his knee. He was helped off the field before limping to
the trainer's room. But the knee was only bruised, and he is
scheduled to play against Tampa Bay Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Where Woodson can definitely help the Raiders, if the team wins,
is by bringing fans to the Oakland Coliseum. Because the Raiders
won only four games last season, the team has 25,000 unsold season
tickets for the 63,000-seat stadium, a staggering number for a
professional football franchise. At this time last year, the
Raiders had 21,000 unsold season tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Raiders played before 18,000 empty seats a game
in their home stadium, leaving attendance at 40,000 to 45,000 fans
a game. By comparison, the last time the Giants averaged under
60,000 fans a game was the strike season of 1987.
</P>
<P>
   It may take some time for the Raiders to bring in those kinds of
numbers. But Woodson will help the team get there. He is such a
dynamic athlete, he could almost single-handedly change the
fortunes for the Raiders, on the field and in the stands.

PIAZZA: JOHNNY BENCH HE ISN'T; THE PACESETTER SPEAKS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Mike Piazza wants to be baseball's highest-paid player, he
should probably learn how to execute the fundamentals of his
position. He came to the Mets with a reputation as a
mediocre-at-best catcher, and he has made plays that indicate that
rating may be too kind.
</P>
<P>
   In the space of a couple of weeks, Piazza messed up two run-down
plays. In the first instance, he did not run the runner back toward
third base far enough and enabled the trailing runner to reach
third instead of having to hold at second. In the second instance,
perhaps compensating for the first, he ran the runner back to third
so far that he never threw the ball to the third baseman, and the
runner dived back into the base ahead of Piazza's lunging tag.
</P>
<P>
   That six-year, $84 million offer the Dodgers made is looking
better and better.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacesetter Speaks
</P>
<P>
   Because Mark McGwire has been the focal point of the pursuit of
the home run record, and as such, his name and picture have
appeared daily in Maris pace charts, maybe he deserves to be
listened to on the subject of pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pace is a pace,'' he said. ``You can be off the pace and
then with two or three in a day, you're right back on it. So I
don't think it really means much until the last out of the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's own experience shows exactly what he means. When he
hit his 45th home run, he was ``on a pace'' to hit 69 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   But then he hit only two home runs in the Cardinals' next 18
games, and his pace plummeted to 61 or 62. Then he erupted with a
barrage of four home runs in three games, and the pace shot back up
to 65 or 66.
</P>
<P>
   As McGwire said, pace means nothing until the last out is made.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: FROM CHIVALRY TO THE NUREMBERG PRINCIPLES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By TINA ROSENBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Agincourt's most famous chronicler has insured that the battle
will be forever known for Henry V's oration to his far-outnumbered
forces. In ``Henry V,'' the speech Shakespeare writes for King
Henry is a masterful call to honor and duty. What is less
remembered is that after defeating the French, Henry grew fearful
the enemy was resuming attack. ``Then every soldier kill his
prisoners,'' Henry orders in the play. In real life his knights
hesitated and Henry called on archers to carry out an act then, as
now, considered a violation of the laws of war.
</P>
<P>
   Today the world has the Geneva Conventions and the Nuremberg
principles. Henry's 15th century had the rules of chivalry. A new
book, ``Bloody Constraint: War and Chivalry in Shakespeare,'' by
Theodor Meron, a law professor at New York University, calls
Shakespeare a defender of a system that underpins international and
humanitarian law today. The rules of chivalry survive, practically
intact, in the Geneva Conventions and the code of the officer and
gentleman. Shakespeare, according to Meron, tried to preserve the
norms of medieval chivalry even as they slipped away in the
Renaissance during which he wrote. Meron argues that modern efforts
to deter and punish war crimes need help from a code of honor that
is not imposed on warriors, but arises from them.
</P>
<P>
   Characters in Shakespeare's histories agonize over the
requirements of a just war, the responsibility of a leader for his
troops' abuses, the granting of mercy, the keeping of oaths and the
treatment of prisoners, women and the dead. Meron shows that in
play after play, Shakespeare writes disapprovingly of characters
who violate chivalric norms and wage unjust wars.
</P>
<P>
   The great exception is Henry V, a heroic character despite his
shocking order at Agincourt and his threats to the citizens of
Harfleur to surrender or see his soldiers ``mowing like grass your
fresh fair virgins and your flow'ring infants.'' Shakespeare's
lenient treatment of Henry V's crimes and the unusual nationalism
of the play may have had to do with the jingoistic climate in which
he wrote, as England mobilized for a brutal campaign against the
Irish.
</P>
<P>
   The rules of chivalry arose to benefit the warring class,
allowing the loser in hand-to-hand combat to receive mercy and the
winner ransom. They enforced the romantic ideal of the loyal,
courageous knight. They were largely unwritten, although Henry V
set down some laws prohibiting warriors from raping women and
harming people or property belonging to the Church. There were even
chivalric courts, and a French knight could sue an English knight
in English chivalric court for nonpayment of ransom and win. The
more efficient enforcement, however, was knightly fear of disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   The rules were generally followed in knight-to-knight combat,
but did not necessarily apply to commoners, who saw no mercy when
knights chose not to grant it. They also held only in Christendom.
Wars against those considered infidels were free-for-alls. The
religious wars that split Europe after the Protestant Reformation
were particularly brutal. Hence chivalry's decline by Shakespeare's
time. It also fell because of technology, as muskets and arrows
depersonalized combat.
</P>
<P>
   The book concerns itself more with analyzing Shakespeare than
with questions of what the modern age can learn from chivalry about
preventing war crimes, but Meron points out the effectiveness of a
code of behavior cherished _ if not always honored _ by the knights
themselves. But such a culture of honor in combat is unrealistic in
the modern world. Chivalry was invented by warriors to safeguard
themselves. Today's laws of war recognize that peasant as well as
nobleman, infidel as well as Christian, deserves protection.
Technology has gone far beyond the musket in depersonalizing war,
now often fought against enemies half a world away and easier to
demonize with each mile. Some of the most brutal recent conflicts,
however, have been fought not with missiles but hoes, machetes or
pistols, as neighbor killed neighbor in Cambodia, Rwanda and
Bosnia. Honor is lost in wars that attempt to wipe out a whole
category of civilians, whether it is Tutsis or Moslems or class
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   The only way chivalric rules appeal to the self-interest of
warriors today is that widespread abuses tend to create more
enemies _ see Kosovo for the latest example. Yet leaders will
continue to commit war crimes when they find advantage in it. ``For
when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom, the gentler gamester is
the soonest winner,'' Shakespeare's Henry V told his troops. One
act later, he ordered his men to kill their prisoners at Agincourt.

PIAZZA'S SLAM PUTS METS OVER 'BACKS, 9-4 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It must have been an omen. The New York Mets changed
the picture they usually show on the video board in left field when
Mike Piazza is at bat from one that displayed him with a serious
look to one of him grinning.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Saturday's game was over, both Piazza and the rest
of the Mets had plenty to smile about.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, who has been sizzling with the bases loaded, turned the
boos to cheers at Shea Stadium with a towering grand slam off Andy
Benes to punctuate a six-run second inning as the Mets overcame a
4-0 deficit and defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks, 9-4.
</P>
<P>
   For an encore, Piazza _ who also had a single and scored a run
in a two-run fifth _ made a sensational catch of a Travis Lee foul
pop in the top of the third, sliding down the steps of the
visitors' dugout to make the out.
</P>
<P>
   And by finishing a brutal five-day stretch with a 6-2 record,
the Mets (72-57) had pulled back into the National League wild-card
lead, a game ahead of the Cubs, who were routed, 8-3, at Wrigley
Field by Randy Johnson and the Houston Astros on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, it was a day of redemption for Piazza, who has done
his best to shrug off the way he has been treated this summer at
Shea. Piazza had heard a smattering of boos when he struck out with
runners on first and third in the first inning. When he came up
again in the second, with a chance to redeem himself, the Mets were
trailing, 4-2. And with one full-count swing, he was back to being
the hero again.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza and his teammates deserved the applause, considering that
the Mets had just erupted for six runs to erase a four-run deficit.
The Diamondbacks had scored all of their runs with two out in the
top of the second off Bobby Jones, who was making a rare start on
three days of rest because the Mets had just completed a stretch of
three doubleheaders in four days.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For a moment, Jones looked as if he was going to escape the
second without allowing a run when he intentionally walked Kelly
Stinnett with two outs and runners on second and third to bring up
Benes. But the strategy backfired when Benes belted a two-run
double over third on an 0-1 pitch. Former Yankee Andy Fox followed
with a two-run single on Jones' next pitch, and the Mets were
staring up from a four-run hole.
</P>
<P>
   But Benes was struggling with his control. His first eight
pitches in the bottom of the first had been balls. And even though
he now had a sizable lead, Benes turned right around and walked
Todd Hundley on a full-count pitch to start the second.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Baerga followed by lining a single over short, and
Hundley kept running _ all the way to third with a head-first slide
as he apparently caught his best friend, Bernard Gilkey, napping a
little in left field.
</P>
<P>
   The next batter was Rey Ordonez, who drew a full-count walk. And
now Benes, who threw 74 pitches in the first two innings, was
really in trouble. But he, too, nearly escaped after Jones struck
out and Tony Phillips lined to right for a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   With runners now on first and third, Edgardo Alfonzo beat out a
check-swing grounder up the third-base line to make it 4-2. A wild
pitch and another full-count walk (this time to John Olerud, who
had narrowly missed a three-run homer to right two pitches earlier)
brought up Piazza with the bases full.

   Piazza quickly fell behind, 1-2, before working the count full.
The shot Piazza then launched into the left field bleachers on
Benes' next pitch was estimated at 380 feet. And if anyone was
booing at Shea, there was no way to tell.
</P>
<P>
   While it was the Mets' first grand slam of the season, it was
Piazza's fourth this year (he hit three with the Dodgers in April,
one against Arizona) and the ninth of his career.

   Kicker Wide Right of Parcells
</P>
<P>
   Playing for New York Jets coach Bill Parcells is tough enough,
but for a kicker, it can be brutal. Just ask John Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Against the New York Giants on Thursday night, Hall flubbed
three kickoffs and missed one extra point and a field goal. That
did not make Parcells happy. The coach blasted Hall in front of
just about the entire team in the locker room afterward, screaming
that since his only job is to kick the ball, he should be doing
better at it.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, Hall is. Last season, many of his kickoffs would sail
into the end zone. But last year means nothing to Parcells, which
is why he brought in the former Green Bay kicker Brett Conway. He
is either competition for Hall or his replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Debt Raised to Pay Rookies
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, the NFL made a move that will affect the way teams sign
players, especially high-priced rookies with huge signing bonuses
and top free agents. Late last month, NFL owners voted to raise the
allowable debt limit a team can carry from $75 million to $100
million. In other words, a team can go $100 million into debt _
normally in the form of bank loans _ without the NFL's stepping in.
The change was basically made because signing bonuses for rookies
and veteran free agents are getting bigger and bigger. Indianapolis
quarterback Peyton Manning recently received an $11.6 million
bonus, a record for a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   Some teams pay for those bonuses by taking out loans. But as the
bonuses have got bigger, so has the debt, and some teams found
themselves needing the higher ceiling to afford those soaring
salaries. One team was at the former limit of $75 million and could
not sign its top two draft picks. When the new limit was approved,
the owner took out a loan and was able to sign them.
</P>
<P>
   Some owners hate the new rule, saying the debt ceiling was
already high enough, and some voted against it, including the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp Vermeil, Rams Ache
</P>
<P>
   One of the more intense camps in the NFL this summer has been
that of the St. Louis Rams. Coach Dick Vermeil runs double sessions
of some three hours each. Players say there is more hitting and
running than they have ever experienced at any level of their
careers. They are complaining of dead legs, and the season begins
in just a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the coaches say their meetings are marathon sessions.
Vermeil, they say, has endless energy, and he expects a lot from
his coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting too old for this,'' joked one.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if the Rams make the playoffs, something that has not
happened since 1989, the players and coaches will feel like
teen-agers.

KENNETH NORRIS, 74, ZOOLOGIST WHO STUDIED DOLPHINS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif.)  (ak) 
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Kenneth S. Norris, a naturalist and researcher who uncovered
much of what is known about dolphins and other marine mammals, died
Aug. 16 at the University of California at Santa Cruz Medical
Center. He was 74 and lived in Santa Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   Norris, who was an emeritus professor of natural history at the
university, underwent heart surgery several months ago and never
fully recovered, his family and colleagues said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took the study of marine mammals and made it a science,''
said Dr. Randall Wells, a conservation biologist with the Chicago
Zoological Society who studied under Norris. ``He was one of the
primary founders of the field.''
</P>
<P>
   As curator of Marineland of the Pacific, one of the country's
first large aquariums, Norris confirmed that dolphins use sound
transmission to see, a process known as echolocation.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, in the mid-1950s, dolphin echolocation was only a
theory. It was Norris' team that figured out a way to blindfold a
dolphin and conduct tests. ``He did a tremendous amount of work to
understand how they do it,'' said Dr. Daniel Costa, another former
student and a biology professor at Santa Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   Norris became fascinated with dolphins' well developed ability
to process sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an ocean full of dullards, what good is such a brain?'' he
asked in a 1980 interview. ``Certainly, complicated nervous
machinery is not needed for concourse with jellyfish, sea cucumbers
and sponges.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, he discovered, was that dolphins use sound to
determine a lot more than distance and direction; they can also
distinguish characteristics like size, shape, even texture. The
dolphin brain can tell the difference between, say, a sheet of
copper and one of aluminum. It was an ability that left Norris in
awe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very hard for us to imagine sensory systems and
processes we do not have,'' he said in the interview. ``It's a bit
like a man from outer space tapping into the Bell System center and
trying to make sense of all the beeps and sounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Norris received bachelor's and master's degrees in zoology from
the University of California at Los Angeles and a doctorate from
the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego. He taught at
UCLA and did research at the Oceanic Institute in Hawaii before
going to Santa Cruz in the 1970s. He retired in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Phyllis; a brother, Robert, of Santa
Barbara, Calif.; three daughters, Susie of Santa Cruz, Nancy Norris
Littlestone of Princeton, N.J., and Barbara Gaskell of Lincoln,
Neb.; a son, Richard, of Falmouth, Mass., and six grandchildren.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some of his early work was far removed from dolphins. Indeed, it
was far removed from the ocean. He studied desert reptiles and also
made important contributions to understanding circadian rhythms in
snakes and the use of color matching as camouflage by lizards.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965 he founded the California Natural Reserve System, a
collection of protected natural habitats that has grown to 120,000
acres and that is used for teaching and research. He wrote books
about marine mammals, including ``Dolphin Days: The Life and Times
of the Spinner Dolphin'' (W.W. Norton, 1991), a personal account of
his research. He was instrumental in the writing of the Marine
Mammal Protection Act of 1972.
</P>
<P>
   In later years, Norris studied sociability among dolphins,
trying to understand, for example, why in the open ocean they
congregate in schools of 50 to 100 or more, while closer to shore
they travel in much smaller groups. He acknowledged that answers
remained elusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought they were magical, mythical animals,'' said Dr.
Dawn Goley, a biologist at Humboldt State University in Arcata,
Calif., and Norris' last graduate student. ``But then again, he
thought that bats and lizards and other animals were, too.''

FOR AMERICA'S BIGGEST HORSE SHOW, TWO HEADS ARE BETTER THAN ONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ak) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEHAMPTON, N.Y. _ People get jobs in the strangest ways.
Consider Tony Hitchcock and his wife, Jean Lindgren, who manage the
Hampton Classic, America's most important outdoor horse show and
its largest (1,600 horses), richest ($400,000 in prize money) and
best attended (50,000 spectators).
</P>
<P>
   This year's Hampton Classic, which begins an eight-day run
Sunday, will mark the Hitchcocks' 21st year in charge. They got
into the business through the back door.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early 1970s,'' Hitchcock said in a recent interview,
``we both taught at the Hampton Day School. Then I was fired and
Jean quit. We didn't want to teach and we didn't want to move away,
so in 1976 we decided to be caterers.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock had been an amateur chef. Lindgren was a good cook.
They had staged international dinners for school fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day in 1976,'' Hitchcock said, ``I got this call and I
recognized the deep voice right away. It was George Plimpton. He
said, `Is there any chance you are free to do a party on Bastille
Day?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Let me check our date book and see if we are booked
that day.' Booked? We had never catered anything. That was our
first call. I made believe I checked our date book and then told
him we could do it. He said: `Fine. We have 1,000 guests.'''
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that everyone brought food, and Hitchcock and
Lindgren provided desserts. Their main job that day was party
management. The party turned out to be like a gigantic family
picnic with celebrities, including much of the Kennedy clan.
Another guest was Tinka Topping. She was a founder of the one-day
Southampton Horse Show, which was expanding to become the Hampton
Classic. Topping was impressed by Hitchcock and Lindgren.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1978,'' Hitchcock said, ``they told us: ``You're good at
catering and managing. Why don't you come back as the coordinators
of the show?' We did, and we have been doing it ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1981, the show has leased the McNamara family's 60-acre
potato farm a half-mile north of the Montauk Highway. Seven more
acres have been leased from the town of Southampton. The grass is
thick and rich, and the trees and shrubs look fresh out of a
nursery.
</P>
<P>
   The summertime Hamptons are celebrity heaven. Joan Lunden and
Stefanie Powers have ridden in the show, and the spectators in
recent years have included Alec and Billy Baldwin, Candice Bergen,
Christie Brinkley, Glenn Close, Bianca Jagger, Billy Joel, Quincy
Jones, Donna Karan, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Paul Newman and
Joanne Woodward, Steven Spielberg, Barbra Streisand and Robert
Wagner.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Through the years, the not-for-profit show has raised $750,000
for charities. Still, Hitchcock and Lindgren are trying to
popularize this white-collar sport by keeping the admission cost to
$5 a person or $15 a carload.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can run a horse show that is not just elitist,'' Hitchcock
said, ``but something that touches everyone in this community, from
the richest to the poorest.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lindgren said: ``I think a lot of people are scared to
come here. They think it's too fancy. They think they won't fit in.
But you look at the people here wearing T-shirts and floppy hats,
and you can't tell who's rich and who's poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Catering has now taken a back seat for the couple. Running the
show is a year-round job, and they also spend eight weeks in the
winter staging six shows in Indio, Calif., near Palm Desert. They
have come a long way for two people with undistinguished careers as
riders.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 6 to about 10,'' Lindgren said, ``I rode a dappled
gray who hated cars and would kick our neighbor's car. I was no
show rider. I rode him just for fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock's equestrian experience is even more limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 12,'' he said, ``this Dr. Loker had a barn with one
swayback horse and five cows. I rode the horse and milked the cows.
At 26, I took five riding lessons. They finally got me to canter,
and it was so terrifying that I haven't ridden since.''

HOTEL INNOVATOR SEEKS BIGGER CHALLENGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (duplication warning: also sent with `f' code) 
(nk) 
 By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bernard Goldberg thinks that minibars in hotel rooms
are appalling. He contends that free chamber music performances
will pay for themselves in guest satisfaction. And if orange juice
is to be billed as fresh squeezed, he said, those oranges should
stay intact until just minutes before the juice is delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg's views on hotel operations command a certain amount of
attention. Over the last 10 years he has taken five rundown but
well-located small hotels in Manhattan and converted them to
attractive properties catering to the city's booming tourist trade.
</P>
<P>
   Now he wants to try something different. Last month he sold his
entire portfolio, consisting of the five hotels plus an office
building on West 55th Street, to Credit Suisse First Boston,
reportedly for close to $150 million. ``It's time to do something
different in size and concept,'' said Goldberg, chairman of Gotham
Hospitality Group. He said he hoped to acquire control of one of
the city's older, larger hotels and restore it to an elegance and
style that he said they once had, but have lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are these old dowagers in this city that are tired and
in need of an infusion of light and air,'' he said. Goldberg said
he was looking for a hotel in the 800 to 1,200 room range. He
declined to identify them, but hotel industry analysts said the
group that he is considering probably includes the Pennsylvania and
Roosevelt hotels, both of which are older properties that have
undergone renovations.
</P>
<P>
   Some hospitality specialists caution that running a big hotel is
different from managing boutiques. Smaller hotels can afford to
cater to business travelers and tourists, but large hotels must
market themselves to larger groups to fill the rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``A large hotel is a different animal in many ways from a
boutique property,'' said Sean Hennessey, New York director of
PricewaterhouseCoopers' gaming and hospitality practice. ``Small
hotels shun the group market, but big hotels have to concentrate on
the group market to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that, as far as he knew, there had been no examples of
an operator buying a big hotel and grafting boutique hotel concepts
to it. But he did note that large hotels had the advantage of
economies of scale, with management costs being spread over a
larger number of rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone can do it, Bernard can,'' said John A. Fox, a senior
vice president of PKF Consulting, which specializes in hotels. He
said Goldberg's success in taking buildings that were little short
of single-room-occupancy residences and turning them into upscale
hotels demonstrated his ability to add value to properties.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg's plans for a big hotel, provided he succeeds in
gaining control of one, consist of style, customer satisfaction and
variable pricing. All three, he said, are important to creating an
experience that will induce travelers to come back to the hotel
when they visit New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you stay at a hotel in Paris, you know that it is
Paris,'' he said. ``You need the same thing in New York. The hotel
has to be thematic. It has to have the feeling of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he said he had looked at hotel properties in Chicago
and Aspen, Colo., he said he was not likely to acquire anything
outside of New York. ``New York is what I know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For his smaller hotels, Goldberg chose every piece of art and
made sure that what was on the wall of the corridors was
coordinated with furnishings in the guest rooms. He said that
integrating the public spaces of a hotel with the guest rooms was
important to creating a pleasant experience for guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at an 800-room hotel in the Broadway district where
the owners had spent a lot of money on refurbishing rooms,'' he
said. He said to reposition the hotel, as the owners wanted, would
require throwing out all the newly purchased furniture because it
clashed with the mass-produced hunting scenes decorating the walls.
``They were from different countries and different periods,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Small things count, Goldberg maintains. Like fresh flowers in
public areas and guest rooms. ``I was at one of the most expensive
hotels in the city and they had an array of silk flowers in the
lobby,'' he said. ``Why not spend $100 to $200 a week to have fresh
flowers in the rooms? That's called thinking about the guest.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg is a real estate lawyer who redeveloped distressed
housing before buying his first hotel, the Wales, on Madison Avenue
between 92nd and 93rd streets, in 1988. He contends that a
short-sighted focus on immediate earnings leads some hotel managers
to do things that degrade the guest experience. Many hotels lease
out ground floor space to retailers, because of the high rents
these businesses are willing to pay.
</P>
<P>
   But if the result is a tiny lobby, guests are cheated, he said.
``If you have a 200-room hotel and a lobby that only fits 40
people, the guests notice it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said free amenities, such as chamber music concerts,
breakfast and after-theater snacks, add to the guest experience
because the hotel does not appear to be trying to squeeze nickels
and dimes out of them. And he said the cost of these amenities is
more than made up by higher room rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can change the character of a hotel with these
amenities,'' he said. ``You should serve scones and strawberries at
tea time along with chamber music.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had installed machines that made cappuccino from
freshly ground beans in his smaller hotels so that guests could
serve themselves at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why he hates minibars. Forcing guests to pay high
prices for a meager bag of chips or a soft drink leaves a bad
taste, he said. Similarly, charging extra to watch a taped movie
adds to the feeling of exploitation, he argues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you charge somebody to watch a movie at your home?'' he
asks. ``That's what the guest experience should be, like a visit to
your home.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Goldberg said he was planning to price rooms at an average of
$225 a night, which would put prices between the current rates for
first class and luxury hotels.
</P>
<P>
   But the $225 number is only an average. Goldberg said he planned
to use a form of marginal pricing to try to fill his hotel every
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are saying that it is great that we have 90 percent
occupancy,'' he said. ``But in a 1,000-room hotel, that means that
100 rooms are vacant. That is the equivalent of a small hotel that
is unoccupied.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would follow a pricing model similar to the one used
by airlines, which charge the highest prices to business travelers
with inflexible schedules. The bargain seats are sold at far lower
prices to people with more time than money, to insure that the
airplanes fly as full as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have suites at $350 a night, but we will also have
rooms for $99 a night,'' he said, to keep vacancies at a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody can make money running a hotel in New York today,'' he
said. ``But what happens when the downturn comes? If you are the
hotel of choice for a lot of people, the business will take care of
itself.''

housing before buying his first hotel, the Wales, on Madison Avenue
between 92nd and 93rd streets, in 1988. He contends that a
short-sighted focus on immediate earnings leads some hotel managers
to do things that degrade the guest experience. Many hotels lease
out ground floor space to retailers, because of the high rents
these businesses are willing to pay.
</P>
<P>
   But if the result is a tiny lobby, guests are cheated, he said.
``If you have a 200-room hotel and a lobby that only fits 40
people, the guests notice it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said free amenities, such as chamber music concerts,
breakfast and after-theater snacks, add to the guest experience
because the hotel does not appear to be trying to squeeze nickels
and dimes out of them. And he said the cost of these amenities is
more than made up by higher room rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can change the character of a hotel with these
amenities,'' he said. ``You should serve scones and strawberries at
tea time along with chamber music.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had installed machines that made cappuccino from
freshly ground beans in his smaller hotels so that guests could
serve themselves at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why he hates minibars. Forcing guests to pay high
prices for a meager bag of chips or a soft drink leaves a bad
taste, he said. Similarly, charging extra to watch a taped movie
adds to the feeling of exploitation, he argues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you charge somebody to watch a movie at your home?'' he
asks. ``That's what the guest experience should be, like a visit to
your home.''

<P>
   Goldberg said he was planning to price rooms at an average of
$225 a night, which would put prices between the current rates for
first class and luxury hotels.
</P>
<P>
   But the $225 number is only an average. Goldberg said he planned
to use a form of marginal pricing to try to fill his hotel every
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are saying that it is great that we have 90 percent
occupancy,'' he said. ``But in a 1,000-room hotel, that means that
100 rooms are vacant. That is the equivalent of a small hotel that
is unoccupied.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would follow a pricing model similar to the one used
by airlines, which charge the highest prices to business travelers
with inflexible schedules. The bargain seats are sold at far lower
prices to people with more time than money, to insure that the
airplanes fly as full as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have suites at $350 a night, but we will also have
rooms for $99 a night,'' he said, to keep vacancies at a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody can make money running a hotel in New York today,'' he
said. ``But what happens when the downturn comes? If you are the
hotel of choice for a lot of people, the business will take care of
itself.''

FORMER MERCHANT MARINE CADETS FACE U.S. MOLESTATION CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Two former cadets at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy on Long
Island, N.Y., who were accused of sexually assaulting a female
cadet in her room last year are now facing federal charges, after
Nassau County prosecutors dropped state charges on Friday because
the state lacked jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the former cadets, Francis Crowley, 23, of Glendale,
N.Y., and Steven Valjato, 22, of Richmond Hill, N.Y., filed a
motion earlier this month to dismiss the state case because the
Kings Point academy was built on federal land.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the question of jurisdiction arose, we researched it and
we arranged for the federal government to take the case,'' said Ed
J. Grilli, a spokesman for the Nassau County district attorney's
office. ``It's clear that we cannot prosecute a case we have no
jurisdiction over. It just all came together Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   The men were arraigned Friday in U.S. District Court in
Uniondale, N.Y. The arraignment was first reported by Newsday
Saturday. It is not known how the new charges will affect
punishment if the men are found guilty of sexual assault on federal
property.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Saturday, Thomas Liotti, Valjato's
lawyer, said state prosecutors had acted vindictively toward his
client by ``zealously'' persuading the federal government to take
over the case.
</P>
<P>
   He also said federal prosecutors had erred in not consulting
with the Justice Department before bringing charges for crimes
committed on federal property.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the government will come to see they have no case
against my client and the charges will be dropped,'' Liotti said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal complaint charges that Crowley molested a junior
midshipman, a top engineering student, in her bed while Valjato
warned her that if she told anyone ``it would be all over.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men left the school shortly after the incident allegedly
took place on Sept. 28. Liotti said Valjato is now an engineering
student at the State University of New York at Stony Brook and
Crowley is working and thinking about returning to school.

TO FLOURISH, ROOF GARDENS NEED PLANNING, MONEY AND PERSEVERANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (ak) 
By JAY ROMANO   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _Tom Kaminski, a traffic reporter for WCBS News Radio
88, spends most afternoons perched in a helicopter looking for the
unusual. What caught his eye one day as he gazed through his
plastic bubble 1,500 feet above street level was a patch of green.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a roof garden on one of the buildings in midtown, and
it was really beautiful,'' Kaminski said. ``That's when I realized
that there are many of these little gardens on roofs all over New
York. Little patches of green sitting high in the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   The little patches of lush green gardens perched on the roofs
and terraces of New York City buildings number at least in the
hundreds and probably thousands, making for an intriguing sight
from the air. Many are private gardens, planted by renters or
apartment owners with access to terraces or patios. Others are
communal gardens installed as an amenity for residents.
</P>
<P>
   They are installed at highly varying costs, but what the larger
roof gardens do have in common, according to real estate
specialists, are the planning, money and perseverance required to
build them successfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roof gardens can be wonderful or they can be a nightmare,''
said Ronni Lynn Arougheti, president of Heron Ltd., a Manhattan
property management company. ``It all depends on whether they're
properly designed, properly installed, and properly maintained.''
</P>
<P>
   Ilyse Fink, a spokeswoman for the Department of Buildings, said
she could not estimate the number of roof gardens in New York City.
Many have undoubtedly been installed illegally without permits, Ms.
Fink said, and those that do have permits have a general alteration
permit, a type that does not necessarily include roof gardens.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a safety perspective, they should be getting permits,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Most large roof gardens are in co-ops and condominiums, because
rental owners usually have little incentive to spend the money to
build them, and managing them effectively may be a larger problem
than they care to undertake, building managers say.
</P>
<P>
   For co-op or condominium boards that decide to develop a garden,
the first problem is often to get residents to support the project
and the expenses it generates. But then other hurdles are likely as
well _ logistical, legal, social, structural and horticultural.
</P>
<P>
   Once a roof garden is finished and operating successfully,
however, the benefits seem to go beyond the enjoyment of buds,
blooms and blossoms. Roof gardens are selling points in older
buildings that lack the health clubs, gyms and swimming pools found
in newer buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons we put in our roof garden was to stay
competitive with all the new buildings,'' said Sanford Greenberg, a
Manhattan lawyer and vice president of the co-op at 155 E. 76th
St., which was adorned with a 1,700-square-foot garden over the
last few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the new buildings that are going up are stressing
amenities,'' Greenberg said. ``And since we were about to embark on
a new roof-replacement program, putting in a roof garden would
certainly be a way of increasing the value of all the shareholders'
apartments.''
</P>
<P>
   James J. Blum, the structural engineer who was hired by the
board, said that it is usually when a building starts to consider a
new roof installation that the subject of a roof garden comes up.
Older buildings with wooden roof-support beams may require the
installation of additional supports to increase the roof's carrying
capacity, he said, and this is more easily accomplished in
conjunction with a roof replacement.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Blum said, whenever any of his client buildings is
replacing its roof and contemplating a roof garden _ even at some
uncertain point in the future _ his advice is that it is generally
worth the additional investment to install the new roof in such a
way as to maximize the roof's ability to support a garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``It actually makes a very small difference in the cost of a
roof-replacement project to plan for a garden,'' Blum said. ``But
it can mean an enormous savings when the time comes to install the
garden.''
</P>
<P>
   The board members at 155 E. 76th St., known as the Queen Anne,
wanted to install a pergola _ a structure designed to provide shade
for the residents. By knowing about the plan before the roof was
replaced, Blum said, he was able to insure that supports for the
pergola were installed as an integral part of the new roof. That
avoided the additional expense of cutting holes in the new roof
surface and minimized the possibility that retrofitted supports
might cause a leak, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Cholst, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that planning could
even avoid legal problems. When planters are placed on the roof
without professional guidance, there is a risk of damaging the roof
and voiding its warranty, he said. ``Basically, you can only use
your roof for the purpose for which it was intended,'' Cholst said.
</P>
<P>
   An early step in the installation of a roof garden should be a
check with the building engineer to make sure that the warranty
will remain in place, Cholst said. At the same time, he said, those
who are replacing a roof and have future plans for a garden should
make sure that the warranty on the new roof will cover the
anticipated use.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that buildings contemplating installing a roof
garden must find out from their insurance carriers whether
additional endorsements will be required.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Arougheti, of Heron, the management company, agreed. ``The
carrier is going to be concerned about parapet heights, whether
there are proper walking surfaces, and even if people are going to
be allowed to smoke up there,'' she said. Low parapet walls pose a
risk of falls and some walking surfaces can contribute to slips.
Smokers may flip a cigarette over the wall and onto someone else's
patio furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Arougheti said she had seen roof gardens that ranged from
the simple to the sublime _ from a wood deck with a planter or two,
to an extravaganza of trellises and trees with ornate planters,
terra-cotta tiles and even showers for sunbathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my buildings has two separate gardens, one for the kids
and one for the adults,'' Ms. Arougheti said, referring to a co-op
at 222 Park Ave. South. The children's garden has a jungle gym and
high parapet walls, and the garden for adults has expensive patio
furniture, professional landscaping and even an automatic sprinkler
system. The building uses the roof for its annual meetings, Ms.
Arougheti said.
</P>
<P>
   But roof gardens can cause problems, she said, in terms of both
maintenance and community relations.
</P>
<P>
   In buildings without automatic sprinkler systems, she said, the
plants must be watered if there has not been sufficient rainfall.
And a system must be developed to deal with litter that residents
leave for others to clean up.
</P>
<P>
   A potentially more difficult problem comes from residents who
are not happy with the garden. ``I was just at a building where the
people who live on the floor under the garden moved out of their
apartment because of the noise,'' Ms. Arougheti said. Upper-floor
tenants and those with private terraces of their own near the roof
are particularly likely to be sensitive to noise. But there are
also concerns about privacy and security, she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Queen Anne, a shareholder in a penthouse apartment
objected to the roof garden because of concerns over all three
issues, Greenberg said. The design accordingly took them into
account.
</P>
<P>
   The walls separating the garden from the shareholder's private
terrace were made high enough so people in the garden could not see
into the penthouse, he said. Video cameras were installed for
security, and the board established ``garden rules'' to minimize
noise and try to prevent other problems. Residents using the roof
garden at the Queen Anne are not permitted to drink alcoholic
beverages, smoke or play radios.
</P>
<P>
   ``The object was to keep the garden a quiet place,'' he said.
``We never intended it as a place for parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur I. Weinstein, a Manhattan lawyer who is also vice
president of the Council of New York Cooperatives, said that in
addition to keeping a roof garden a tranquil place, the drafting of
specific rules prevents it from becoming a source of contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to have as much in writing as possible,''
Weinstein said. And he generally recommends specific restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my buildings allow shareholders to have small parties,
provided they sign an indemnification agreement with the co-op and
obey all the rules,'' Weinstein said. Under this agreement the
resident responsible for a party agrees to reimburse the co-op for
any expenses for damages or cleanup after the party.
</P>
<P>
   He generally recommends that co-ops require the shareholder
giving the party to leave a deposit to insure payment of those
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein said he also recommends that specific hours of use be
established and strictly enforced, and that children be allowed on
the roof only when accompanied by an adult. Finally, he said, a
policy covering access to the roof by guests and perhaps even
renters should be established and adhered to.
</P>
<P>
   Claims against strangers or rental tenants are much more
difficult to pursue than are those that are against shareholders,
Weinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Vitelli, a senior vice president at Insignia
Residential Group in Manhattan, said one of the management's
biggest problems is dealing with residents who build gardens on
their private terraces without proper planning or supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Even a small roof garden that has been installed improperly can
cause serious problems, Vitelli said. If planters are not elevated
and properly supported, they can severely damage the roof membrane
and cause leaking into apartments below, he said. And planters that
do not allow for proper drainage can become so heavy from
accumulated water that they can cause structural damage on terraces
not designed to support so much weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get more calls about leaks caused by planters than almost
any other leak-related problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, informal communal gardens that residents
start on some roofs frequently evolve from little green patches to
big green problems for building management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these roof gardens have had plants growing on them for
as long as 20 or 30 years,'' he said. ``Once you have all that
equipment and all that dirt and all those plants and trees in
place, it becomes an enormous expense to haul it all off and go
back and do it right.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Vitelli said, anyone contemplating a private garden
_ as well as well-intentioned residents determined to spruce up the
roof _ should first consult the building's management, which should
then consult the building's engineer, to determine whether a garden
is feasible and to make sure that if it is, it is installed
properly and with the necessary permits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some co-op boards don't allow any plantings at all,'' Vitelli
said. ``And if we had it our way, that would be the standard
practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in buildings with sturdy roofs, strict rules and happy
shareholders, a roof garden would be of little use without plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``A roof garden can cost anywhere from $5,000 to well over
$100,000, depending on what you want it to look like,'' said Philip
Roche, a landscape designer with Plant Specialists, the Long Island
City company that designed and installed the Queen Anne's roof
garden. The cost for an average-size roof garden is about $50,000
for buildings that want something between unadorned decking and
horticultural extravagance.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant factors in designing a roof garden are the
amount of money and space available and the amount of weight the
roof can support. ``Years ago, there really wasn't much control
over rooftop gardens,'' Roche said. ``But now, buildings have to be
strict about conforming to city codes.''
</P>
<P>
   There are requirements relating to entry and egress, he said. As
a result, gardens must be designed not to interfere with required
exit doors. Height requirements for parapet walls must be followed
if people will be using the roof for recreational purposes, he
said, even if such recreation consists solely of sunbathing or
meditating on the beauty of the skyline. Designs are adjusted to
comply with codes, and the plans are presented to the building's
engineer for suggestions for modifications.
</P>
<P>
   And that, he said, offers another example of the utility of
planning a roof garden long before the first potted plant takes
root.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were working with the engineer at the Queen Anne even
before they started working on the roof,'' Roche said, explaining
that such early involvement made it possible to instruct the
roofing contractor to modify the substructure of the roof during
reconstruction so that it could accommodate a garden.
</P>
<P>
   Once that was done, Roche said, the company was able to exercise
broad latitude in deciding what kind of plants and planters to use
and how densely they could be installed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that goes on a roof today is usually removable,''
Roche said. A fundamental rule of roof-garden design is that the
soil the plants are put in should never come in contact with the
roof surface itself. Instead, modern roof-garden design employs
industrial-strength yet lightweight planters set on wood decking or
concrete or terra-cotta tiles that are themselves elevated above
the roof surface.
</P>
<P>
   In the Queen Anne, after the new roof was installed, Plant
Specialists laid down concrete paving tiles in the area that was to
be used for the garden. The tiles were set on a plastic pedestal
system that elevated them a few inches above the roof surface and
provided a concealed space through which irrigation pipes and
wiring for lighting were run. Once the tiles were down, Plant
Specialists brought in the planters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use a lot of fiberglass, a lot of wood, a bit of clay, and
rarely we'll use stone,'' Roche said, adding that the planters
themselves were constructed at the company's headquarters. In most
cases, he said, roof planters are designed to spread the planter's
weight over the greatest possible area while keeping the planter
body slightly elevated above the surface. All planters have
drainage material and filter cloths to insure that any water that
seeps out is free of soil or other solid material, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Roche said the planters are usually transported to the roof
empty and then filled with soil and plants. In the Queen Anne,
however, the tree-filled planters were hoisted up the side of the
building.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, the co-op board wanted the garden to be a
parklike place that required as little maintenance as possible,''
Roche said, so 14 trees were installed with ivy growing in the soil
around the trees. Most of the planters, he said, were constructed
of cedar with benches attached. All, he said, have automatic
watering systems and lighting fed from piping and electrical wiring
run up through the pavers and into the bottom of the planters.
</P>
<P>
   The garden was finished with a wisteria-covered pergola, some
teak steamer chairs and other chairs and tables. Total cost:
$80,000.
</P>
<P>
   And why would a board spend so much for 14 trees, some ivy and a
few deck chairs? ``It gives life in the city another dimension,''
Roche said. ``It keeps you sane.''

WET WEATHER MEANS LONGER POISON IVY SEASON THIS YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore., Ky., Mass.)  (ak) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though it might seem hard to imagine another problem that can be
attributed to the notorious El Nino, here's one you may not have
heard yet:
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been one very bad year for poison ivy,'' said
Kathlene Cowan, information systems manager for Tec Laboratories,
an Albany, Ore., manufacturer of products designed to alleviate
skin irritations. ``Because of all the rains we've had this year,
we are now seeing the poison ivy season extending into the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cowan said the season for poison ivy generally peaked in the
spring and started to wane by July. This year, however, she said,
individuals sensitive to the plant could still be bumping into it
as they rake leaves and drag them where the plant may still be
growing. ``About three out of four people are allergic to poison
ivy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee McGoodwin, managing director of the Oklahoma Poison Control
Center in Oklahoma City, said the rash that develops after contact
with poison ivy is an allergic reaction to an oily substance _
urushiol _ contained in the leaves and stems.
</P>
<P>
   One thing frequently not taken into consideration, Ms. McGoodwin
said, is that urushiol can remain on clothing, tools and pets _ and
retain its potency _ for up to a year unless it is washed off.
Moreover, she said, those who come in contact with the substance
typically do not exhibit symptoms for up to a week. As a result,
she said, there is a good chance that people who get poison ivy
will not know when or where they came in contact with the oil. And
after urushiol is on the skin, there is only a short period of time
in which to wash off before it is too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's generally impossible to wash it off with ordinary soap
and water after 10 or 15 minutes,'' Ms. McGoodwin said, explaining
that the proteins in the oil bind tightly with proteins in the
skin.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not altogether impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what Technu is for,'' said Ms. Cowan of Tec
Laboratories. The product, sold in drugstores, can remove urushiol
from the skin as long as 10 hours after contact with the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly, the easiest way to avoid poison ivy is to recognize
it and stay away from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``While identifying the plants and avoiding them would seem to
be the best way to protect yourself from the rash, it's certainly
not a foolproof approach,'' said Dr. Joseph Fowler, an associate
clinical professor of dermatology at the University of Louisville.
In fact, Fowler said, in a nationwide survey earlier this year,
more than 75 percent of those surveyed said they could identify
poison ivy _ while 66 percent indicated that they or a family
member have had poison ivy, oak or sumac.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler said there was hope even for those who would not know a
poison ivy plant if they tripped over one: a product called Ivy
Block, a ``pre-exposure'' lotion that can prevent urushiol from
binding with proteins in the skin, stopping the allergic reaction.
The product can be found in drugstores and sporting goods stores.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For those who want to avoid poison ivy the old-fashioned way
there is always ``The Poison Ivy Card,'' available from the Center
for Poison Ivy Information in South Weymouth, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   John L. Palmer, director of the center, said that the key to
using the card _ which costs $1 and is available from the center's
World Wide Web site (www.woodsweb.com) _ is to ``stick it in your
pocket and carry it around.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is to actually look for poison ivy and then compare
what you see on the ground to the pictures on the card,'' Palmer
said. The reason people frequently misidentify poison ivy, he said,
is that it comes in different configurations. The plant can be
found in the Northeast in various forms _ such as a vine, a
ground-hugging shrub or an erect, woody bush, he said. Moreover,
while the leaves are greenish brown during the spring and summer,
they often turn red in fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is one consistent characteristic, however,'' Palmer
said. ``There really are always three leaves.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, knowing the plant when one sees it does not help much
if one does not see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think they know what poison ivy looks like,'' Palmer
said. ``But they never think they'll find it in their own backyard.
So that's the last place they look for it.''

   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The ghosts of collapses past have been
exorcised. There has been little talk about the scorching heat,
even during one of the hottest summers in recent memory, and few
worries about how young players will respond to the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Mark McLemore looks around the Rangers clubhouse and
says: ``I see a lot of guys with experience. It's the Geritol bunch
... with Will (Clark) being the oldest. That eliminates the panic
effect. Not that we have it, but with these guys, you're going to
eliminate that right away.''
</P>
<P>
   The pennant race is returning to The Ballpark in Arlington, and
this time it should be calmer. The Rangers are 1 1/2 games behind
the Anaheim Angels in the American League West and insist they have
the battle-tested experience to handle pennant-race pressure better
than during the frantic, nerve-wracking run of 1996 when they
nearly all fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, going through it for the first time, you were
nervous,'' outfielder Juan Gonzalez said. ``Now I think we'll be
more comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' run in 1996 had a successful ending. They won the
first division title in franchise history. But there was a tense
stretch in late September when they lost nine of 10, including four
consecutive in Seattle, cutting what was once a nine-game lead to
one with 10 days left in the season.
</P>
<P>
   Only two brilliantly pitched games by John Burkett and Ken Hill
saved the Rangers from total disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't very pleasant,'' infield coach Bucky Dent said.
``But there were a lot of things the team was overcoming, trying to
win for the first time and getting that ghost off our backs. There
was a lot of pressure there.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I look back on all the teams I played on, even the good
teams, and it still always came down to winning games in that final
week. The big thing is we did win it.''
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, the Rangers put to rest the horrible reputation
they had carried through the years as a team that wilted when the
heat of a pennant race was turned up high. That kind of talk
dominated the 1996 race, much to the Rangers' annoyance.
</P>
<P>
   They futilely tried to downplay such talk before the division
was clinched but admitted afterward it was a much bigger factor
than they ever expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the big monkey on our backs,'' first baseman Clark
said. ``This franchise hadn't done anything in 25 years. Now we've
got a division title under our belts, and we've got some guys that
have been through a pennant race. You still have to go out on the
field and execute, but as far as being mentally prepared, it should
be a little easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen players on the Rangers' 25-man roster have participated
in postseason play, which means they've previously been on a team
that emerged victorious in a pennant race.
</P>
<P>
   Only nine of the 25 players from the Rangers 1996 playoff team
had been in postseason before that season, and Clark and shortstop
Kevin Elster were the only regulars. This year, seven of nine
regulars have been in the playoffs, the exceptions being center
fielder Tom Goodwin and the designated hitter platoon of Lee
Stevens and Mike Simms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experienced players help you immensely,'' manager Johnny Oates
said. ``There's no substitute for talent, but if you put talent and
experience together, I'm a firm believer there's no substitute for
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   For Gonzalez, McLemore, outfielder Rusty Greer, catcher Ivan
Rodriguez and many others, 1996 was the first time they went
through a full season in a heated pennant race from start to
finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a new experience for me, and experience is a good
teacher,'' Greer said. ``Personally I tried not to put more
emphasis on those games than I did on the 100 games before. That's
when you start pressing. I just tried to say, it's another ballgame
and go out and perform the way you do all year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, who haven't been to the playoffs since 1986, have to
deal with the reverse. Many of their key players haven't been in
postseason but were there in 1995 when the Angels blew a 14-game
lead in the second half and lost a one-game divisional playoff to
the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be (an advantage),'' Dent said. ``They have all those
things haunting them too. But it still comes down who plays the
best, who wants it the most and who gets after it ... who has the
will and wants it the most.''

PARALYSIS FROM ACCIDENT FAILS TO SINK SPIRITS OF FORMER TEXAS
CORNERBACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The discourse Tyres Dickson had prepared advocating
harsher penalties for driving while intoxicated may have more
impact when he finally delivers it to a speech class at the
University of Texas, almost a year later than planned.
</P>
<P>
   Trust that it also may be well-attended.
</P>
<P>
   For it is likely that the former Longhorns football player will
give the speech from a wheelchair _ he was paralyzed from the chest
down as the result of a spinal-cord injury sustained last spring in
an automobile accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't get a chance to give the speech before spring
break,'' Dickson recalled recently from a hospital bed at The
Institute for Rehabilitation and Research in the heart of Houston's
Medical City. ``It's real ironic. The last thing my professor said
to me was, `Tyres, you'll be first when we come back on Monday.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That Monday won't occur before some time in January, when
Dickson hopes to resume his UT classes.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 1 a.m. on March 22 _ the Sunday morning Dickson
was to return to campus from spring break _ the 1994 Saturn
carrying him and three friends was broadsided by a '98 Suburban at
an intersection of an access road and a street that passes under
U.S. 290 in northwest Houston. The blood alcohol of the Suburban's
28-year-old driver, who witnesses reportedly said sped up to go
through a red light, tested at a level of 0.23. A driver is legally
intoxicated in Texas at 0.10.
</P>
<P>
   Dickson sustained a fractured vertebrae. His spleen was ruptured
and he sustained other internal injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Though the 20-year-old former two-way all-city player at Houston
Scarborough High School maintains the stance he previously outlined
in that yet-to-be delivered speech, he says he bears no ill will
toward the driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have accepted what happened as a turn of life,'' Dickson
said. ``Everybody makes mistakes. I just wish he hadn't made his
when he was drunk. He could have been smarter and gotten a friend
to drive. But him as a person? I don't hold any animosity toward
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen people were injured in the chain-reaction, five-car
accident. Approximately 1 million people are injured in
alcohol-related crashes every year in the U.S., according to
statistics from the national office of Mothers Against Drunk
Driving in Irving.
</P>
<P>
   As Dickson _ perhaps fortunately _ nodded off to sleep that
night in the back seat, he might have dreamed of starting spring
practice at Texas in less than two weeks. After a freshman redshirt
season, he was expected to win a place in the secondary rotation at
cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking forward to showing my stuff,'' Dickson said with
a smile, the Bible he was reading moments ago folded shut next to a
pillow. ``There were open jobs and I was ready to apply. But then
this happened. My regret is that I never did get a chance to show
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither friends nor family are surprised at Dickson's
magnanimous attitude toward the driver of the other car, nor the
way he has accepted the most-personal tragedy and vowed to
overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``His attitude is the best I've ever seen in anybody considering
what's happened to him,'' said UT junior linebacker Aaron Humphrey,
one of Dickson's closest friends on the team. ``I'd be in a fit if
it was me. I can't believe how high his hopes are. He is an awesome
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tyres has shown miraculous courage,'' said his mother Beverly,
who, though legally blind has raised three sons who are pursuing
college degrees and another who recently graduated from the U.S.
Military Academy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, he's helped me and I'm a pretty strong person. He's
laid there paralyzed from the chest down and encouraged others.
When other people were crying and didn't know how to approach him,
he's helped them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a tough competitor who was punishing on the field. But
he's unusually sweet, a truly nice guy. This has turned our family
inside out, but we're going to survive. It's a struggle, but we're
used to struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickson was one of the state's most sought-after athletes as a
senior when he graduated from Scarborough in 1997. An honor
student, he was a starting quarterback and defensive back on a
football team that he led to its first district championship in
1996. Besides being a captain on the football team, he served
similar roles on the basketball and track squads.
</P>
<P>
   Tyres Dickson also cooked for and took care of his mother when
she was stricken with arthritis when he was 8 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't walk,'' Mrs. Dickson said. ``He took care of me. I
love all my sons. But this is my youngest. The one who is very
closest to me in a special way.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the congregation at Christ Holy Temple say as a
teen-ager, Tyres was a driving force in the church's youth program.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the youth in the church look up to Tyres,'' said Mary
White, a longtime church member and family friend. ``He has always
been a very special, a very talented child.''
</P>
<P>
   She often talks to Tyres on the phone _ which frequently rings _
by his hospital bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk about him holding on and believing that he will walk
again. He has a lot of faith. He was reared to believe that all
things are possible and he has not given up. I told him _ that if
he believes he will walk again _ I believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Used to setting goals as an athlete, Dickson clings to that
belief. He made remarkable progress in his first stay at the
rehabilitation institute in May and early June before incurring a
serious infection this summer from a bedsore. That setback forced
him back into hospitals for two more operations. He may face six
weeks of inactivity before he can again undertake rehabilitation
exercises.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a definite setback,'' Dickson said. ``But I just
think if I take one step back I've got to take three steps forward,
because I've got to stay two steps ahead. I'm going to make it
through this.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his drive, Dickson's physical steps in the future may be
limited, said Dr. Kenneth C. Parsons, who is director of
spinal-cord injury and outpatient clinical services at the
institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not seen any meaningful recovery of neurological
function in (Dickson's) legs in the time that we have known him,''
Parsons said. ``I don't make long-range predictions about patients.
But the situation is as it is right now and we don't see any signs
of things changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tyres is a fantastic person. I'm sorry he has to be my
patient. But I love being his doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon before the accident, Beverly Dickson said she and
Tyres both took naps. Mrs. Dickson awoke from a dream with a start.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dream was very disturbing,'' she said. ``It was like Tyres
was in trouble or something and I was thinking he was in Austin.
But I woke up and thought there couldn't be anything to this dream
because he's here. I got up and went in and looked at him in his
bed, just to convince myself that everything was all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Stevenson has been a friend of Dickson's since they met on
the first day of school in the sixth grade. Fellow survivors of
neighborhood strife and teammates on various athletic teams since,
they had not seen each other in several months.
</P>
<P>
   But Stevenson had called Dickson and driven in that day from
Prairie View, where he was in college. They ate dinner with two
friends at the home of Stevenson's aunt and later visited another
friend. From there, Dickson called his mother about midnight and
told her he was on his way home.
</P>
<P>
   Confident of his whereabouts with a friend she knew and trusted,
Beverly drifted off to sleep. Tired after a long day and pleasantly
full, Tyres did the same on the way home in the backseat of
Stevenson's car.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is a blessing that neither Ray Stevenson nor Tyres
Dickson remember what happened shortly after Stevenson exited 290
and approached the light at the first intersection, just a couple
of exits down from Scarborough High.
</P>
<P>
   ``The light was green for me,'' Stevenson remembers. ``I started
through, but I never saw the (Suburban) before it ran into us. I
was knocked unconscious, so I don't remember anything that happened
after that and I'm thankful for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suburban slammed into the much-smaller Saturn on the
passenger side. Miraculously, neither of the two occupants on that
side incurred lingering physical injury. Stevenson sustained a
concussion, two broken ribs and a punctured lung.
</P>
<P>
   But the scars and suffering are not only physical when such a
trauma occurs. Stevenson, like Dickson, won't return to college
until the spring semester.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still trying to get myself straight,'' Stevenson said.
``It was a traumatic experience for all of us and especially for me
_ because Tyres is my best friend and now he's paralyzed and that
hurts me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking forward to going down to Texas this fall to see
him play and I'll never get a chance to do that. But it's hard for
me to even think about. Because I know playing football is
something that Tyres loved doing so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickson lived with Scarborough High School government and
economics teacher Leslie Taylor and her family during the spring of
his senior year, after the Dicksons were forced to move from their
old neighborhood to escape gang warfare. The Taylors have remained
close to Tyres.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely something real about Tyres that draws
people to him,'' Taylor said. ``We've spent a lot of time
commiserating about what's happened to him and I think he's finally
come to terms that this is probably a permanent state of being.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I also know that he's going to continue to think that he's
going to walk and you can't take away that one shred of hope. When
he was first at (the institute), he went after his rehabilitation
like gangbusters just like he did everything else. That's the way
he's always been _ give me a challenge and I'm going to conquer it.
But I think emotionally and mentally, he's going to have a lot of
work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary White, who has known Dickson since he was a baby,
nevertheless expects remarkable things from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He most definitely will accomplish some things someday,'' she
said. ``He has already touched so many lives just in our church.
And I know he will touch others in the future.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
CONTRIBUTIONS NEEDED &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because Tyres Dickson did not have a personal insurance policy
and the other driver's car insurance was insignificant, Dickson's
family faces bills that Beverly Dickson estimates at more than
$250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Two funds have been established to help with both the medical
and personal expenses, which have already enabled the purchase of a
special bed. Donations to defray medical costs can be sent to the
University of Texas, c/o assistant athletic director Ed Goble, P.O.
Box 7399, Austin, 78713-7399.
</P>
<P>
   Contributions to the non-medical fund can be sent to The Tyres
Dickson Fund, NationsBank, P.O. Box 620020, Dallas, TX, 75262-0020.

N.J. ADDS TWO FINANCING PROGRAMS TO HI-TECH RECRUITMENT EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RACHELLE GARBARINE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   New Jersey's three-year effort to retain and attract emerging
high-technology companies took a step forward recently with the
start of two financing programs by the state's Economic Development
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   They are the $100 million Technology Funding Program, meant for
growing companies to expand, and the $3 million Seed Capital
Program, intended to help businesses bring new products to the
market. Under both programs, which became available in June,
technology companies can get below-market-rate loans to construct
new buildings, renovate existing buildings or to buy equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Construction also has started on the fifth building at the
Technology Center of New Jersey, the state-sponsored research park
taking shape on 50 acres in North Brunswick. The 60,000-square-foot
structure has been designed for multiple tenants who get the space
for a reasonable price and can expand in place as they grow. The
new building, called Tech II, will join four others now at the
park, which ultimately will comprise up to 800,000 square feet of
office, research and production space.
</P>
<P>
   The state has devised ``a special program that takes a
three-pronged approach'' to nurture the growth of high-technology
business, said Caren Franzini, executive director of the
development authority. The approach, she said, involves promoting
New Jersey as a high-technology state, making real estate available
to companies and now providing financing to them. The authority is
administering the financing programs and, using public and private
funds, is developing the technology center in North Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that these companies can become the Microsofts of
tomorrow,'' said Gualberto Medina, commissioner of the state's
Department of Commerce and Economic Development. ``Creating a
favorable environment is good for these businesses and good
business for the state because it will create jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Science and technology-related companies are considered a growth
engine for the state, which ranks seventh in the nation in the
number of high-technology jobs. In 1997, about 168,000 people were
employed in technology-related business, ranging from
telecommunications and electronics to biotechnology and
pharmaceutical concerns, with a total payroll of $9.9 billion,
according to the latest figures available from the federal
Department of Commerce. There were also 145,000 research and
development employees working in 700 laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's appeal to emerging firms in those industries is not
surprising. It is home to such communication giants as AT&AMP;T and its
spinoff Lucent Technology, as well as to the David Sarnoff Research
Center, which conducts electronics research. They provide a strong
resource for the over 5,000 electronics, software and information
technology concerns already in the state.
</P>
<P>
   And its large concentration of drug companies _ including
Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck, which produce at least 43 percent
of the pharmaceuticals sold in the nation _ serve as a magnet for
the 601 biotechnology, biomedical and health-care related firms
that have sprung up here, says the New Jersey Technology Council, a
Princeton-based nonprofit trade group.
</P>
<P>
   The two recently initiated financing programs are expected to
bridge ``the gaps in the lending market'' faced by these companies,
which private lenders have viewed as risky because they lack the
traditional ``bricks and mortar collateral,'' said Ms. Franzini of
the development authority. The programs are the result of
discussions over the last year among state, industry, banking and
academic leaders, she said.
</P>
<P>
   To that end the authority, using its owns funds, which are
derived from loan origination fees or interest income, will either
provide loans itself, participate in or guarantee a portion of the
loans secured from banks or do both. The programs are expected to
assist 75 to 100 companies over the next few years, Ms. Franzini
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The first company to take advantage of the Technology Funding
Program is Price Systems, a software development and licensing
business in Mount Laurel. Last year, the Lockheed Martin Co., its
parent, wanted to sell the company and entertained bidders from
other states that would have moved it out of New Jersey, said
Anthony DeMarco, president of Price.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he and three other managers, using a $1.6 million state
loan, purchased the assets of the business in July from Lockheed
Martin. DeMarco said he would increase his New Jersey workforce,
now at 26, by five to 10 employees a year for the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of the management team was to retain as much equity
and control of the company as possible,'' said DeMarco. Without the
state loan, he said, that would have been difficult to do because
while the company had ``intellectual products, it had few of the
tangible assets'' banks traditionally look for when providing
loans.
</P>
<P>
   The Technology Funding Program, a joint effort of the authority
and six commercial banks, is providing $100,000 to $3 million loans
for up to 10 years to growing companies.
</P>
<P>
   Under the program the bank provides 70 to 75 percent of the loan
at a market rate, and the authority gives the rest at a
below-market fixed rate of 5 to 7 percent. If needed, the authority
will also guarantee up to 50 percent of the bank's loan.
</P>
<P>
   The blended interest rate lowers borrowing costs, Ms. Franzini
said, while the shared financing reduces a bank's risk and
leverages the authority's funds. ``This gives banks the backing we
need to get over the collateral issue,'' and makes the lending
process ``more palatable,'' said Christopher Giamo, a vice
president at Commerce Bank, a lender that was involved in the loan
to Price Systems. He said the program will help stimulate more such
loans.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Gov. Christie Whitman also signed a package of bills
into law, effective next Jan. 1, that will offer tax credits and
tax incentives to technology-based businesses to help offset the
costs of research and development. Prime among them is the
technology business tax certificate transfer program, considered to
be the first of its kind in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``By freeing up more capital these companies, which live
day-to-day, can breathe a sigh of relief,'' said Debbie Hart,
executive director of the Biotechnology Council of New Jersey, a
Trenton-based nonprofit trade group, referring to the financing
programs. No one incentive is the panacea, she said, but added:
``One-by-one the state is adding more tools to the arsenal to make
it easier for companies to do business.''

THERE'S NO LAKE IN TEXAS LIKE CADDO, A PLACE OF MYSTERIOUS BEAUTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By BOB HOOD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNCERTAIN, Texas _ Some say Caddo Lake was formed by an
earthquake. Others say it was a big logjam on a nearby river that
forced water into what once was only a swamp. Others say the lake
simply came about before history _ before man really looked back at
his past because the present was so peacefully wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   One thing certain about all the uncertainty, however, is that
Caddo Lake and the surrounding rolling hills and pine forests have
attracted people for a multitude of reasons, from the Kadohadacho
Indians centuries ago to French and Spanish explorers, criminals,
steamboaters, fishermen, hunters and naturalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't another lake like it in Texas,'' camp operator
Gary Kempf said recently as he piloted a flat-bottom boat down a
narrow boat lane not far from Crip's Camp, a neat little fishing
camp Kempf and his wife operate.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people leave here, what they remember most is the cypress
trees, the lily pads and the Spanish moss,'' Kempf said. ``But
there is a lot of history here, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Historians say Caddo Lake was created by either the New Madrid
Earthquake in 1811-1812 or the Great Raft, a gigantic logjam on the
nearby Red River.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Great Raft and the overflow from the Red River into
what is now known as Caddo Lake probably had the biggest influence
on shaping the lake, there is no argument that the swamplike
features of the several small lakes, canals, sloughs and ditches
were there centuries earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Raft theory for joining the various waterways into one
is the most widely accepted of the two, mainly because the logjam
was reported by explorers long before the New Madrid Earthquake and
also because it is a known fact that it caused major flooding on
both sides of the Red River.
</P>
<P>
   That dispute may never be settled, but anyone who has visited
the lake and its surrounding small towns and communities will agree
that the scenic beauty, the abundance of fish and wildlife, and
historical artifacts and pictures make Caddo Lake a popular place
to fish, hunt and vacation.
</P>
<P>
   More than beauty has attracted people to Caddo Lake, historian
Fred Dahmer notes in his book, ``Caddo Was ...'' However, not all
visitors have come for the scenery.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1800s, one area of the lake was so noted for its
racetracks, rooster fights, saloons, brothels and criminal activity
that it boasted of averaging at least one violent death per day,
Dahmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Steamboats also made their way into Caddo Lake history. Pictures
of the old woodburners can be found on the walls of shops and
fishing camps around Caddo Lake and surrounding towns such as
Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   A government contractor named Henry Shreve completed destroying
most of the 150-mile long Great Raft in 1833, halting the operation
at a place that bears his name _ Shreveport. Steamboaters not only
made their way to Shreveport but around the Great Raft to the Caddo
Lake bayous and on to Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures of some of the life at Caddo Lake in days of long
ago are among the many attractions anglers, bird watchers and other
visitors find so uniquely interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from its historical attractions, Kempf said the biggest
attractions Caddo Lake offers is an abundance of fish and aquatic
vegetation.
</P>
<P>
   Fishing generally is good year round, though the average depth
is only 10 to 12 feet in the deepest areas. Largemouth bass, hybrid
striped bass, bream, crappie and catfish are the most popular
species sought by anglers, especially around the moss, cypress
trees and yoncopin.
</P>
<P>
   The yoncopin, which today can be found covering large acres of
shallow or muddy flats on both sides of a boat lane leading from
Crip's Camp to the open waters, actually is an American Lotus, a
lilylike plant that is as rich in interesting facts as it is in its
beautiful yellow flowers that blossom above its bluish-green pads.
</P>
<P>
   People come to Caddo Lake not only to see the acres of pads with
creamy yellow flowers but also come to cut the yoncopin's seed
receptacles only to sell them later as flower decorations, Kempf
said.
</P>
<P>
   The lotus' seeds resemble chinquapins, or acorns, and actually
are edible if they are harvested in their prime _ just before
drying out. It has been said the seeds became a favorite snack of
the Kadohadachos, from which Caddo Lake was named by early
settlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A law finally has been passed to stop people from cutting the
yoncopins,'' Kemp said, ``and that pretty much put an end to that.
But a lot of people still strip the trees of Spanish moss'' for
decorations.
</P>
<P>
   The lotus is especially abundant today because of a three-foot
low water level and warm summer that has spurred its growth, just
as it has juvenile cypress, a tree whose seeds grow in damp soil
and not in deep water or on dry land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of those cypress trees are 350 or more years old,'' Kempf
said, ``and many of the smaller ones are 100 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Kempf said the location of the biggest cypress trees, ones with
trunks several feet in diameter, are interesting because they
indicate where the water level was many years ago. Because the wind
and current carried the seeds to the banks where they settled into
moist soil, the areas where the largest cypress trees stand today
work as markers, indicating what once was the shoreline of the many
small lakes and sloughs that now are part of Caddo Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Time may have changed something as simple as a name and as
complex as a river, but time has not changed the hauntingly
beautiful maze of trees, aquatic vegetation, and wildlife-rich
waterways of Texas' oldest and largest natural lake.

CONWAY COMPETING WITH HALL FOR JET JOB 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (changes snapper to holder in second-from-last graf)  (mk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Brett Conway took to the practice field as a
Jet for the first time Saturday, exuding confidence. But John Hall,
who once seemed to be the team's kicker for the new millennium,
seemed to be distracted.
</P>
<P>
   Conway became a Jet on Friday after Hall produced a disastrous
performance against the Giants on Thursday night: three straight
squib kickoffs, a missed extra point, a blown 37-yard field goal
that went so far left, it looked like a foul pop into the
third-base seats.
</P>
<P>
   Hall is still a Jet, but Conway will handle all the kicks during
Friday night's preseason finale at Chicago. Hall will essentially
have to not merely boot the ball into the end zone consistently,
but also show coach Bill Parcells he can be successful on 75
percent of his field-goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Conway was one of the best kickers in college during his Penn
State career. His final boot for Penn State came in the closing
seconds against Michigan State in 1996 and lifted the Nittany Lions
into the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been reading that a lot of people think he's got a
stronger leg,'' Conway said when asked about Hall. ``We'll see. I
had five preseason kickoffs and three were touchbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall, meanwhile, declined to meet with members of the news media
Saturday. As he entered the cafeteria at Hofstra University, he was
swinging a key chain. When he saw a clutch of reporters gathered on
the other side of the automatic doors, he began to nervously swing
the chain furiously. The doors closed on him as he went through
them. He was unhurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about anything,'' Hall said of the kicking
situation.
</P>
<P>
   He then said he would be back for interviews after lunch.
Instead, he left through a back door.
</P>
<P>
   Conway's route from Green Bay to the Jets isn't so surprising
considering that the Jets and the Packers have been involved in two
other trades in the last year. The Packers' general manager, Ron
Wolf, and Parcells are not only longtime admirers of each other's
football acumen, but also neighbors in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   And Parcells rated Conway as the best college football kicker
available in last year's draft. Wolf, however, drafted him in the
third round.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pretty much handed me the job last year,'' Conway said.
``Drafting a guy in the third round and not signing your kicker of
eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pack had dropped Chris Jacke. But Conway suffered a
quadriceps injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never got back on track,'' he said. ``I kicked too much the
next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Longwell became the Packers' kicker and Conway sat out the
season. In this year's camp, Conway said, ``the last couple of
weeks I was kicking really well.''
</P>
<P>
   But he could not unseat Longwell. ``I don't look at it as not
making the Packers,'' Conway said. ``They were going to get a draft
choice for either one of us, whoever they traded.''
</P>
<P>
   Conway will be working with an inexperienced holder, punter Nick
Gallery, as was Hall. Gallery replaced Brian Hansen, who was traded
to the Packers last Monday. When Hansen held for Hall last year,
the kicker was successful on 27 of 36 field-goal attempts _ or 75
percent. But when quarterback Glenn Foley held, Hall was a 20
percent kicker, hitting only one of five field goals.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Green Bay, Conway had a conversation with Wolf
about Parcells. Then the kicker met the Jets coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You've heard stories about me, I'm sure,''' Conway
said, adding that he replied, ``Yes, sir, I have.''

GIANTS TURN TO HAMILTON AND WILLIAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ After a day off, the New York Giants
returned Saturday for their first practice since breaking training
camp on Wednesday, their first since a 27-23 preseason loss to the
New York Jets on Thursday, and their first without Jason Sehorn,
their injured cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   With Sehorn out for the season after tearing his right knee
while returning the opening kickoff against the Jets, Conrad
Hamilton, a three-year veteran , became the starting right
cornerback. Hamilton has started in only one regular-season game,
and that was as a nickel back. Shaun Williams, the safety from UCLA
drafted in the first round last April, will try to learn the
cornerback position.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday, Williams was not even on the grass practice field
next to Giants Stadium. Coach Jim Fassel said that before the Jets
game, he had given Williams permission to go home after the game to
handle a personal situation. Williams was expected back Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   When the Giants play the Baltimore Ravens here Friday night in
their final preseason game, Williams will be the nickel back.
Williams, a free safety in college, already has a heavy load: free
safety, strong safety, nickel back, dime back, special teams and
now cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel was concerned how his team would take the devastating
loss of Sehorn. The coach's message was simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the team you always face adversity,'' he said, ``and at
times you have to push through adversity. You don't look behind you
to see what's left. You have to look forward. You don't worry about
what you don't have.''
</P>
<P>
   Practice, even without pads, turned out to be business as usual,
to Fassel's relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought practice was good,'' he said. ``They paid attention
at meetings. I didn't expect the guys to have the same zip today as
if we won the game and Jason was healthy, but in the training room,
Jason said: `Don't worry about me, Jim. I'm going to be all
right.'''
</P>
<P>
   Corey Widmer, the middle linebacker, said: ``Every team goes
through this. It doesn't mean we can't have a good season. We're
going to have to learn to deal with it and go forward. You have to
be able to look through adversity. Don't let one bump in the road
do in your year. There're going to be more bumps.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton knows that. He is 23-years-old, 5 feet 10 inches and
195 pounds, soft-spoken, confident and realistic. After the Jets
game (``I thought he played well,'' Fassel said), Hamilton faced
his new responsibilities without blinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'm the starter,'' he said. ``My team needs me now. I
think I have the skills to start at corner. I usually play left
corner, and this is right corner, but there's not really much
difference. You turn your head ha different way, and it's a little
different the way you read and backpedal. But it's not a big deal.
Covering somebody is covering somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday's practice, Hamilton said he understood his new
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't compare me to Jason,'' he said. ``Jason is one of the
five top cornerbacks in the league. Our styles are totally
different. He's polished. Give me a chance to get a little
experience, and see where I am in a couple of years. I've just got
to prove it on the field. Every backup thinks he's ready for prime
time. I'm going to get every opportunity to do well.''
</P>
<P>
   When a starter goes down, other teams tend to pick on his
replacement. Hamilton expects that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can hear them say: `They've got a new guy. Challenge him.'''
he said. ``Why not? This is football. Guys get hurt. I'm one of the
backups, a quality backup. It's a challenge to me, and I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   The Giants cut 16 players. They included OMAR DOUGLAS and EDDIE
GOINS, both veteran wide receivers. C.W. ESTES, a defensive end,
West Point graduate and an Army artillery officer, was placed on
the reserve/military list. The others were first-year players and
rookies: quarterback BEN ANDERSON, offensive tackle DARRYL GILLIAM,
offensive guard MARC LAMB, centers COREY BAILEY and BEN FRICKE,
defensive ends HUNTER ADAMS, JIMMIE BELL and CHRIS SNYDER,
defensive tackle BRAD KEENEY, linebacker MARCEL WILLIS, cornerback
RAPHAOL BALL, safety RASHEE JOHNSON and punter WILL BRICE. The
roster is down to 64 players. All National Football League teams
must reduce to 60 by 4 p.m. Tuesday. Two of the Giants' four
remaining cuts will be easy because cornerback JASON SEHORN and
outside linebacker COREY MILLER, who has a herniated disk in his
neck, are headed for injured reserve.

President and Mrs. Clinton, returning to the White House, after a
memorial service at Andrews Air Force Base, for the Americans
killed in the bombings at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya. For
some time, Clinton has hoped that foreign policy, which daunted him
early in his first term, could help redeem him in his second. After
the most tumultuous week of his presidency, capped by a strike on
terrorist outposts, the question that now haunts Clinton is how he
will be judged in light of the Monica Lewinsky matter. (Stephen

President and Mrs. Clinton, returning to the White House, after a
memorial service at Andrews Air Force Base, for the Americans
killed in the bombings at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya. For
some time, Clinton has hoped that foreign policy, which daunted him
early in his first term, could help redeem him in his second. After
the most tumultuous week of his presidency, capped by a strike on
terrorist outposts, the question that now haunts Clinton is how he
will be judged in light of the Monica Lewinsky matter. (Stephen

NY-BIKER-MOVIESTAR, 8-22 -- Chuck Zito, president of the New York
Nomads chapter of the Hell's Angels motorcycle club. In his 45
years, Zito has been many things: outlaw biker, convict, bodyguard
to the stars and stunt man. Now, Zito is trying to leap from macho
man to movie star. Last winter, Zito won his best role yet, a part
in ``Oz,'' a prison drama series on HBO in which he plays an
enforcer for a group of Italian inmates. ``I watch a lot of these
actors and say to myself, 'I could do it better,'''he says.
``They're trying to look like what I really am.'' (Edward

NAIROBI VICTIM'S FATHER SAYS CLINTON KEPT PROMISE TO RETALIATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo.)   (bl)  
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The father of one of the Americans killed in
terrorist bombings in Africa said Saturday that President Clinton
had fulfilled a promise to victims' families with Thursday's
retaliatory strikes against sites in Afghanistan and the Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad he did it, and I wish he'd do more,'' Kenneth Hobson
Sr., of Lamar, Mo., said Saturday in a telephone interview. ``I was
just surprised it happened so quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Hobson's son, Sgt. Kenneth Hobson Jr., 27, of the Army, a
defense attache's aide at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, was
one of 12 Americans killed in the bombing there Aug. 7.
Simultaneous car bomb attacks in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, in
neighboring Tanzania, killed 263 people and wounded more than
5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Hobson said that when families of the victims met with Clinton
in Washington, he asked the president to promise him that the
United States would take action when the authorities identified
those responsible. ``I said, `Promise me one thing: When you have
evidence and proof of who did it, that something will be done.
Promise me that you won't just let them go hide in another country
and say that we can't get to them.'''
</P>
<P>
   The father, a decorated Army veteran who served in Vietnam, said
the president replied: `` Hobson, I know my obligations and duties,
and we will take care of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, he kept his word,'' Hobson said of
the cruise missile strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Hobson, widow of the slain Army sergeant, said in a
separate interview that she wished that there were alternatives to
military action to deter terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't fight terrorism with terrorism, but this is our only
recourse since you can't sit down and negotiate with these
terrorists,'' said Mrs. Hobson, a former Army enlistee who left the
service after the birth of her daughter, Meghan, now 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I wish there was another way,'' she said. ``If it means
that no other families have to go through what we have to go
through, then military action is a good idea. But I fear it may
cause more problems, more bombings, and more innocent people being
hurt.''

CLINTON FREEZES ASSETS OF BIN LADEN, ALLIES
</HEADLINE>
 LADEN-BOS  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton announced Saturday he had frozen
any assets of Osama bin Laden and his terrorist allies held by US
companies, while the administration said new information shows that
US missile strikes Thursday damaged all six suspected terrorist
camps targeted in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our efforts against terrorism cannot and will not end with
this strike,'' the president said in his weekly radio address. ``We
should have realistic expectations about what a single action can
achieve. And we must be prepared for a long battle.''
</P>
<P>
   He announced that he had signed an executive order authorizing
US officials to freeze assets and to block all financial
transactions between bin Laden and any US company or individual.
The order was signed Thursday, the day the United States fired
missiles on the camps in Afghanistan and a suspected chemical
weapons plant in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton unveiled the new move against bin Laden amid reports of
antiterrorist enforcement actions abroad. In Albania, police
arrested 10 alleged terrorists with possible links to bin Laden. In
Kenya, a newspaper said that three jailed men had confessed to a
role in the US Embassy bombing there.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden is the exiled Saudi multimillionaire who is the chief
suspect in the Aug. 7 bombings at US embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania, which killed 12 Americans and 245 Africans. His business
interests range from agricultural and construction companies to
banking and investment firms, US officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration officials said they did not believe that
much of bin Laden's money is held by US firms, but that the
executive order was a first step in determining the extent of his
holdings and choking his financial support. They said the United
States was urging other nations to freeze bin Laden's assets and
block his financial transactions, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes money, lots of it, to build the network bin Laden
has,'' the president said. ``We'll do our best to see that he has
less of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that an earlier executive order
blocks transactions between US companies and Islamic Jihad, a group
they said is affiliated with bin Laden. Officials said the latest
order is part of a pursuit of bin Laden that includes greater
intelligence collection and possibly more military action.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also said it had received ``somewhat better
visual imagery'' that confirmed its previous assessment that damage
was ``moderate to severe'' at the six camps in Afghanistan, where
bin Laden and his allies were reportedly training terrorists. On
Friday, officials said that cloud cover had hindered spy satellites
from collecting images of the camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of the six camps sustained some level of damage,'' White
House spokesman Michael D. McCurry said Saturday in Edgartown, on
Martha's Vineyard, where the president is vacationing.
</P>
<P>
   He said Clinton was to meet with the national security adviser,
Samuel R. Berger, on the new assessment. ``I think the president
will hear that we have severely damaged the ability of the Osama
bin Laden network to train and operate from these camps that were
attacked,'' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   The US attacks included cluster bombs that rained shrapnel on
the camps, Cable News Network reported.
</P>
<P>
   In Kenya, a newspaper reported that three jailed suspects had
confessed to helping plot the US Embassy bombing in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswomen for the FBI and State Department in Washington said
those agencies had no comment on the report.
</P>
<P>
   In Albania, police raided several alleged terrorist safe houses
and arrested 10 foreign nationals. The raids Friday night followed
reports that Albanian intelligence agents and the CIA had launched
a nationwide manhunt for suspects involved in terror attacks in
Egypt, including the November 1997 massacre of 62 people in Luxor.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech last week, Clinton said that intelligence agencies
suspected bin Laden's organizations in the attack in Luxor.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Republicans further rallied behind President
Clinton's military strike against bin Laden's group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president deserves our support for acting swiftly and
decisively,'' said Senator John McCain of Arizona, in the
Republican response to the president's radio address. But McCain
repeated his earlier criticism that Clinton has failed to bring the
same resolve to ``the many other threats to American security that
have festered from this administration's negligence.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said Clinton ``is willing to abandon'' the program of UN
inspections that could deprive Iraq of weapons of mass destruction.
And North Korea is constructing a vast, underground complex for
building nuclear weapons, McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Park Police placed concrete barriers around the Washington
Monument Saturday because of heightened security concerns.
Spokesman John Love-land said the monument is among the few major
public memorials that a vehicle can park near. Police also began
checking tourists' bags at the monument.

CLINTON SWEARS TO USE `ALL TOOLS' AGAINST TERRORISM 
</HEADLINE>
 
(inserts report of U.N. worker's death in Afghanistan)  (js) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton vowed Saturday that the United
States would use ``all the tools at our disposal'' to fight the
terrorist network of Osama bin Laden, as the administration
outlined efforts to squeeze him financially following the U.S.
cruise-missile strikes Thursday in Afghanistan and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our efforts against terrorism cannot and will not end with
this strike,'' Clinton declared in his weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
   As he vacationed with his family in Martha's Vineyard, Clinton
announced that he had signed an executive order, effective a day
earlier, that asks the Treasury Department to block any financial
transactions with U.S. companies by bin Laden, two of his
lieutenants and what the U.S. says is his principal terrorist
organization, the Islamic Army.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 48 hours after the United States attacked a
pharmaceutical factory in Sudan and a training camp in Afghanistan
with roughly 75 cruise missiles, the administration also provided
more detail on the damage it said was done to bin Laden's network.
</P>
<P>
   A day after cloudy weather partly obscured the extent of the
damage in Afghanistan, presidential spokesman Mike McCurry said
Saturday that satellite photographs showed the strike hit all six
separate sites within the sprawling training camp, located in a
remote, mountainous area about 90 miles south of the capital,
Kabul.
</P>
<P>
   A full assessment could take more time, but McCurry, sticking to
the measured claims of the day after the attack, said the strike
had caused ``moderate to severe'' damage to the site's barracks,
ammunition depots and other facilities. Bin Laden has used the camp
in the past, but his whereabouts remained unclear on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have severely damaged the ability of the Osama bin Laden
network to operate from these camps,'' McCurry said, speaking to
reporters on Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, a Saudi exile accused of underwriting attacks by
terrorist groups around the world, is believed to have an inherited
fortune exceeding $200 million invested in a network of
argricultural, construction and financial companies that, officials
say, helps pay for and conceal terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
   The president's order, which he signed only hours after the U.S.
strikes, places bin Laden and his associates on a list of
terrorists monitored by the Treasury Department. The order
prohibits all Americans and U.S. companies from having any
financial transactions with them, including business and
fund-raising. The order also requires banks to freeze any assets
found to belong to them.
</P>
<P>
   The effort is not likely to have a significant impact on bin
Laden's financial empire because, a senior administration official
said, he does not appear to have many assets that would fall under
the scope of the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would not expect this single step to cripple this network
any more than we would expect a single military action in Khost, in
Afghanistan, to cripple this network,'' the official said. But the
official said the administration hoped the formal legal step would
prompt other countries to help freeze bin Laden's assets. In his
address, the president called for precisely that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes money _ lots of it _ to build the network bin Laden
has,'' Clinton said. ``We'll do our best to see that he has less of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the world, the fallout from the bombing continued. The
Arab League announced Saturday that it would hold a meeting in
Cairo on Monday to coordinate support for Sudan. In Khartoum, the
capital of Sudan, another day of protests began on Saturday.
President Omar Hassan al-Bashir pledged to retaliate for the
destruction of a pharmaceutical factory that, U.S. officials
maintained, produced material for chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In Afghanistan, an Italian military officer working for the
United Nations died Saturday, a day after he was shot in Kabul,
though it was still not clear whether the shooting was related to
Thursday's strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Washington, lawmakers rallied around the president.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., expressed strong support for
Clinton's efforts. ``The president deserves our support for acting
swiftly and decisively,'' McCain said in the Republican Party's
weekly radio address. ``The military strikes he ordered against
targets in Afghanistan and Sudan were appropriate. America's armed
forces carried out their mission with skill and professionalism.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's senior national security advisers _ Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and Secretary of Defense William Cohen _
went to Capitol Hill to build support for the strikes. In a
classified briefing on Friday, they also laid out the evidence the
administration says links Bin Laden to terrorist attacks, including
the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Aug. 7,
which killed 263 people, including 12 Americans.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., who had sharply questioned the timing of
the strikes given the controversy over Clinton's relationship with
Monica Lewinsky, emerged from Friday's meeting softening his
remarks. ``There does appear to be credible evidence to suggest
that targeting an Osama bin Laden terrorist training site was
necessary,'' Coats said.
</P>
<P>
   However, he went on to say that Clinton's behavior had made
skepticism about motives and timing of the missile strikes
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the president's private scandal that is leading to the
public's skepticism,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his radio address, Clinton thanked congressional leaders for
offering bipartisan support for the attacks. He said the United
States had ``compelling evidence'' that bin Laden's network ``was
poised to strike at us again _ and soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton emphasized that Islam and its adherents were not the
threat, trying to draw distinctions between the Islamic world in
general and what he called ``a callous, criminal organization.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hundreds of millions of Muslims all over the world _ including
millions right here in the United States _ oppose terrorism and
deplore the twisting of their religious teachings into
justification of inhumane, indeed, ungodly acts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he vowed to press the fight, Clinton, echoing similar
remarks by Albright and other aides, grimly suggested that
Thursday's strikes, however effective, were not likely to put an
end to bin Laden's self-proclaimed war on the United States and
U.S. interests. ``We should have realistic expectations about what
a single action can achieve,'' he said. ``And we must be prepared
for a long battle.'' &QL;

CLINTONS EXPECTED TO MAKE FIRST PUBLIC APPEARANCE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN O'BRIEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; EDGARTOWN, Mass. _ In what has been a low-profile vacation,
the Clintons are expected to make their first public appearance
since arriving on Martha's Vineyard when they attend church
services Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the Clintons were not among the hundreds of islanders
who gathered at the Union Chapel in Oak Bluffs for a memorial
service for Dorothy West.
</P>
<P>
   West died last week at the age of 91. The influential
African-American writer made the island her year-round home
starting in 1943. One of her best known works, ``The Wedding,'' was
edited by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and later Oprah Winfrey
produced the movie version.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday White House press secretary Michael McCurry was asked
how the president and his family were faring during such a
tumultuous time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's working at it, and my guess is that they have
still got work to do,'' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think there is a healing process that needs to occur,
and as far as I can tell, it's under way, but it's not done yet.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said the president Saturday was finally in ``vacation
mode'' after returning to the island on Friday. The smaller house
on the 80-acre Oyster Pond estate where the Clintons are staying is
serving as a combination exercise room and office for the
president. The Clintons are staying in the main house on the
property, an antique farmhouse, with access to private beaches and
boating.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it appears that Chelsea Clinton is the only member of
the first family whose vacation is following a familiar pattern.
She has spent several evenings with friends, Stanford College
students who are also vacationing on the island, according to White
House aides.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry suggested that Clinton may play golf Sunday. The
president usually plays a lot of golf when on vacation, often with
Vernon E. Jordan Jr., his close friend.
</P>
<P>
   The Jordan family attended the memorial service for West, and
Harvard University Law School professor Charles Ogletree welcomed
the congregation, sharing his favorite memories of the woman known
as ``the first lady of Oak Bluffs.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Clinton's Vineyard trip this year may be low-profile,
security, as always, is a high priority.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Massachusetts State Police arrested a Connecticut man
in New Bedford, after Secret Service agents escorted him off the
island after he was reported to have inquired several times as to
how he could locate the president. Robert E. Ross, 50, also
allegedly told the agents that he had some firearms in his car in
New Bedford. State police retrieved two firearms from his car,
which was parked in New Bedford, according to a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   He was arraigned Saturday on two counts of possessing a firearm
without a permit.

MORE AFRICAN NATIONS GETTING INVOLVED IN CONGO WAR

   KINSHASA, Congo _ In another sign that the civil war in Congo is
mushrooming into a regional conflict pitting African nations
against one another, Angola reportedly joined Zimbabwe on Saturday
in sending troops to Congo to assist President Laurent Kabila's
efforts to repel a rebellion that is believed to be backed by
Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   The government of Uganda immediately threatened to enter the
conflict if the countries did not withdraw their forces from Congo.
The warning was issued on the same day that a conference to
negotiate a peaceful resolution, led by South African President
Nelson Mandela, failed to begin as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel forces seeking to overthrow Kabila have advanced as
close as 30 miles west of the capital here, according to reports
from the area and Western diplomatic officials in Kinshasa. The
rebels could be in a position to march into Kinshasa before any
serious attempts to arrive at a diplomatic solution get under way,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In Pretoria, weekend talks organized by Mandela began poorly
Saturday when a meeting of the main countries involved in the
conflict was postponed until Sunday. Kabila did not go to Pretoria,
and neither did Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe. The heads of
Uganda and Rwanda arrived in Pretoria as planned.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Kabila said Saturday night that he would not attend the
Sunday talks, but that two of his Cabinet ministers already in
Pretoria would stay for the conference.
</P>
<P>
   The aides said that Kabila would remain in the southern city of
Lubumbashi, where he has spent almost all of the last week and from
which he directed the second half of his seven-month war to unseat
his predecessor, the longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
   Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni declared that if ``unilateral
intervention intensifies'' in Congo, his country ``may be forced,
after due internal consultations, to take its own independent
action in the protection of its own security interest.'' Uganda and
Rwanda, which backed Kabila's rebellion against Mobutu, have cited
Kabila's failure to secure their common borders as one of the
reasons they no longer support him.
</P>
<P>
   The military intervention by foreign countries has centered in
the area southwest of Kinshasa. In the westernmost region, rebels
told Reuters that they were battling troops and tanks that had
arrived from Angola. In the region just west of Kinshasa, Kabila's
forces have already been joined by several hundred troops from
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Kabila refused to disclose details about the help they
were now receiving, but said it was coming from three countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia said clearly that they were going
to help us, and that's what they are doing,'' said Didier Mumengi,
Kabila's information minister. Dominique Sakombi Inongo, a senior
adviser to Kabila, said Namibian planes had been used to transport
Angolan-supplied arms and other equipment to the region near the
Atlantic Ocean. That report could not be independently confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia belong to the 14-nation Southern
African Development Community, of which Congo is also a member. But
the organization is not united in its policy toward the civil war.
The group's most important member, South Africa, has opposed
military involvement, and the disagreement has led to diplomatic
tensions between South Africa and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda and Uganda, which are not members, chose Kabila to head a
successful revolt against Mobutu less than two years ago. At first,
Kabila counted ethnic Tutsi Congolese and Rwandan Tutsi among his
closest aides. But Kabila eventually cut himself off from the
Tutsi, who are deeply disliked by other Congolese. Kabila's actions
led to the current 20-day-old rebellion, which is led by ethnic
Tutsi Congolese and also includes former military officials from
Mobutu's army.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda and Uganda have denied any involvement in the rebellion.
But both nations have strongly denounced countries that have come
to the aid of Kabila's government.
</P>
<P>
   In Kinshasa on Saturday, the electricity was turned on and off
repeatedly by the rebels, who control a huge hydroelectric dam
southwest of here on the Congo River.
</P>
<P>
   Reached by telephone at his home Saturday night, Mumengi, the
information minister, began a conversation by saying, ``I'm in the
dark.'' As his children could be heard in the background, he added
that he felt confident that the government forces could push back
any rebel attempts to capture Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very calm here with my children,'' said Mumengi, whose
government has tried to use the power cut to to increase local
residents' anger with the rebels.

TORCH HASN'T BEEN PASSED IN NHL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; If Mark McGwire breaks Roger Maris's home run mark (), his
number also should carry a caveat, as in: () _ established in the
era of Triple A pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever seen so many groove jobs? Given this kind of
pitching, Dick Stuart could make a run at Maris, and old Dr.
Strangeglove is 65 years old.
</P>
<P>
   That said, however, watching McGwire's prodigious blasts this
summer has reminded us just how badly the NHL needs a New Man,
someone to capture the audience's attention and imagination at a
time when everyone in the Original 27 looks like so many cast
members from ``Mighty Ducks 3.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember, we are now more than 10 years past Wayne Gretzky being
dealt from Edmonton, and 5-6 years beyond the Great One's prime.
When the end came for Bobby Orr in the mid-'70s (OK, officially it
was the '78-79 seaon, but ... ), Gretzky's arrival in '79 came in a
blink. The segue to Greatness was seemingly seamless.
</P>
<P>
   Between Orr and Gretzky (and Mario Lemieux in the sidecar), the
game had a virtual quarter-century of someone with McGwire-like
stature. Who is that guy now?
</P>
<P>
   Stop the head scratching.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't exist.
</P>
<P>
   The segue from Greatness has brought us to a dead end.
</P>
<P>
   It was going to be Eric Lindros. Well, L'Enfant Terrible will
turn 26 years old this season. Tempus fugit, big fella. Even Philly
management is finally realizing that it just isn't going to happen.
Oh, the Flyers have tried to make it happen, and they continue to
keep up the beat, with their belief that, if you pay him, he will
come. But six seasons have shown Lindros to be a hunk of potential,
with the occasional awesome display of talent, forever to be
something less than everyone expected. Flyers general manager Bob
Clarke said as much going into the latest round of negotiations,
which was one part posturing and one larger part the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The single greatest talent in the game today is Pittsburgh right
winger Jaromir Jagr. He'll turn 27 this season and has the skill to
dominate the league for the next 4-5 years. He can't be the muscle
that Lindros sometimes is (all too infrequently) but he is
electrifying. He makes the games glow, without the need of Fox
implanting a computer chip in his helmet to make him blur across
the screen.
</P>
<P>
   The rule changes approved by the NHL Board of Governors in June,
aimed at opening up the game and limiting clutch-and-grab tactics,
could go a long way in elevating Jagr to The Man status. Some of
the things we don't know: Will the refs make the calls? Will Jagr
remain hungry and healthy? Will the lowest common denominator
prevail, causing teams with lesser talent again to devise defensive
schemes to rub out the likes of Jagr?
</P>
<P>
   If the game goes back to Square One again, then no one is going
to shine, and what we'll be left with is a men's senior league that
asks the public to shell out $50 or $60 to see the Lynn Raiders
grunt it up with the Pembroke Patroons. Get your tickets now.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr isn't alone at the top. There are some other sparkling
talents, such as Paul Kariya, Sergei Fedorov, and Pavel Bure. Teemu
Selanne and Peter Forsberg should be mentioned in the same breath,
somewhere on the cusp of inhale and exhale.
</P>
<P>
   So much is going right for the league now. A new
Disney/ESPN-/ABC television deal is about to be inked. In New York,
commissioner Gary Bettman has assembled a real
marketing-merchandising-advertising machine that understands how to
get the product out there.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, whether any sport truly takes off _ and keeps
soaring _ comes down to the talent of one, two, or three
individuals. We give you Jimmy Connors, Bjorn Borg, and John
McEnroe. Tennis swats on today, but virtually in anonymity. It's
bowling, without the Saturday afternoon time slot. Heck, we give
you Babe Ruth, and to a lesser extent Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   It just takes one guy. An Orr. A Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   Batter up.
</P>
<P>
   Who will it be?
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Former Bruin  &UR; John Carter &LR; , &UR;  &LR; his wit as quick as his legs when
he played the Garden, will be behind the bench for Nichols College
(Division 3) this winter, calling the shots as head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I helped out with the Woburn High team last year, and I
absolutely loved it,'' said the 35-year-old Carter, whose career
came to a close earlier in the '90s after no fewer than eight eye
operations, his left eye injured while he was playing in a Bruins
intrasquad game at UMass. ``I had a bad stretch there for a while,
but getting back in hockey, I can't tell you how good I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   In a span of 18 months, Carter went through a divorce, surgery
to have his eye permanently removed, and endured his mother's
death. He is now employed as a mental-health worker in a lock-down
unit at a psychiatric hospital, a job he'll keep (third shift)
while he starts down another career path in hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I went through with my eye, I'll tell you, I wouldn't
wish that on anyone,'' said Carter. ``I went through absolute hell.
For two years, I couldn't work. I was in agony. The pressure would
build up so much, I'd have to have the eye drained two or three
times a week. Turned out, the best thing to do was to take it
out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nichols job is a starting place. Late last week, Carter was
working on a dry-land program for his new charges, and he'll meet
with his club for the first time soon after classes begin in
September. Come October, he's back on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be a great experience,'' said Carter. ``I'll have to
learn recruiting, all the NCAA rules, but I think it will be great.
When I was playing for  &UR; Kevin Constantine  &LR; in Kansas City (IHL), he
treated me like an assistant coach, and when I was there he said I
should think about coaching when I was done playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, I've missed it. I loved playing. I did it almost every
day from the time I was 8 years old. People say it all the time,
but it's one of those things, you really don't appreciate it enough
until it's taken away from you.''
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Let's not allow Fox to fade from the hockey screen without
giving Uncle Rupert TV credit for at least attempting a different
kick at the puck. To be different in the '90s typically means to be
irreverent, often without any knowledge base to back up the
criticism. Fox didn't poke fun at the game or treat it
disrespectfully. On the plus side, it flooded the arena with more
cameras and dramatically boosted the sound at ice level. Its
mistake was that it took what many of us believe to be a beautiful
sport, one that doesn't need much more than arena organ music as a
backdrop, and tried to jazz it up with glowing pucks and animated,
gun-blasting robots. The attempt made the game look and feel
cartoonish. The viewers were slighted, almost insulted, and it
diminished the work of some very fine broadcasters. After a while,
you expected Goofy and Daffy Duck to be handling the mike. Note to
all American broadcasters: It isn't that difficult. Tune in to a
half-dozen Hockey Night in Canada broadcasts and take it from
there. And don't forget to include the look-at-that-guy-sweat
interviews between the periods. It might not be great TV from a
production sense, but people out here like to see what the players
look like, hear what they have to say. There's a lot to be said for
keeping it simple and allowing the game the space, time, and touch
to sell itself. Fox tried too hard. A for effort. D for impact ...
The feeling around Edmonton is that if Boston University defenseman
 &UR; Tom Poti  &LR; can make a splash immediately, the always
budget-conscious Oilers could look to wheel  &UR; Roman Hamrlik &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the
talented blue liner they picked up late last season from the
Lightning. Now that Tampa Bay is back in the bucks _ with new owner
 &UR; Art Willliams &LR;  _ GM  &UR; Phil Esposito  &LR; would like to get Hamrlik back
in the Bay. Doubtful. Hamrlik will make just shy of $2.5 million
this season and assuredly will look for $4 million-plus with his
next pact. If he lands anywhere for longer than a layover, it will
be in one of those five or six cities where cash is considered only
a mathematic exercise ... And look for  &UR; Marty McSorley  &LR; to return
to the Oil, if the price is right (read: around $700,000 plus
incentives). Always good to have a little extra toughness in camp
... Another BU Terrier, Hobey Baker winner  &UR; Chris Drury &LR; , &UR;  &LR; remains
without a contract. His agent,  &UR; Mark Witkin &LR; , &UR;  &LR; has been going back
and forth with Colorado management _ Drury was their fifth pick,
72d overall in '94 _ but as of Friday the numbers didn't match up.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   With less than three weeks remaining until training camp,  &UR; Ted
Donato  &LR; remains a Bruin. Will he be there when the bell rings to
start class? That remains up to the front office. The Bruins have
said they'll try to accommodate Donato's wish to go elsewhere, but
the focus this summer on Causeway Street has been arbitration cases
( &UR; Dmitri Khristich &LR; , &UR; Rob Tallas &LR; ) &UR;  &LR; and primo free agents ( &UR; Jason
Allison &LR; , &UR; Kyle McLaren &LR; ). Donato remains designated for assignment,
which could mean he'll log some time in Wilmington, awaiting the
training camp kinks to work out. He's one of those guys who
virtually every team in the league would want, but not to the point
of giving up much value to get him. Unless packaged correctly
(hello, Khristich?) in a deal that would bring back talent, he's
worth more to Boston than anyone else. But his point is this: If
the coach doesn't want to use him, then he's better elsewhere.
Point well taken, and the front office agrees ... Bure wants out of
Vancouver because, among other things, he receives too much
attention in that city. Don't you love it? A guy negotiates a deal
that will bring him upwards of $8 million this year, but doesn't
understand that there are conditions and responsibilites that go
beyond lacing 'em up for 82 games or more each year. Time to invest
in a dark hat and a pair of sunglasses ... It's almost September
and the Leafs have yet to move netminder  &UR; Felix Potvin &LR; . There are
at least four likely suspects: Canadiens, Canucks, Oilers, and
Panthers. In the meantime, it looks as if Potvin and  &UR; Curtis
Joseph &LR; , &UR;  &LR; signed as a free agent, will be sharing shots at training
camp. Potvin and  &UR; Pat Burns  &LR; can shout to each other from their
lakeside homes on the Quebec/Vermont border. If the Bruins had more
to offer in swap, and especially if they weren't still on the hook
for  &UR; Jim Carey's  &LR; pay ($5 million between now and May 2000), Burns
might be able to think about throwing his pal in the back of his
pickup when he makes the drive down here ... The Bay State's  &UR; Jim
Campbell &LR; , &UR;  &LR; once high on the Bruins' dance card (they opted instead
for  &UR; Glen Murray  &LR; at No. 18 in the '91 draft), will pocket a total
of $1.9 million from the Blues, courtesy of arbitration ... The
trickle-down effect from the new $600 million TV deal for every NHL
team will be around $4 million a year. Today that amounts to a No.
2 or No. 3 defenseman. By the end of the deal, it likely will pay
for a No. 10 or 11 winger. If you're wondering where the rest of
the money will come from, consult the 10 digits that are currently
holding your copy of today's Globe.

GORDON IS TEAM-DRIVEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The car and driver are a given. To win a race on the
ultra-competitive NASCAR Winston Cup circuit, you cannot do without
one or the other, but those elements have to be supported by a
solid team. In Jeff Gordon's case, his victory in last weekend's
Pepsi 400 at Michigan International Speedway was directly related
to the fine work of his supporting cast, The Rainbow Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   When Gordon pulled his No. 24 Dupont Chevrolet Monte Carlo into
Victory Lane, he appeared to be stunned with the result. After
climbing out of his car, Gordon shrugged and shook his head in
disbelief, as if to say, ``I really don't know how I got here.''
</P>
<P>
   But was there any question, really?
</P>
<P>
   It had everything to do with Gordon's team, which put him in
position to win with rapid work in the pits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This crew doesn't give up,'' Gordon said. ``We don't ever give
up until the checkered flag drops.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's eighth victory of the season was also his fourth in a
row, tying Mark Martin (1993), Bill Elliott (1992), Harry Gant
(1991), Dale Earnhardt (1987), Darrell Waltrip (1981), and Cale
Yarborough (1976) for most consecutive victories in NASCAR's modern
era.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, in the Goody's Headache Powder 500 at Bristol,
Tenn., Gordon attempted to become the first to win five in a row.
The reason he was in position to do so has been readily apparent to
his competitors and his teammates in the three-car Hendrick
Motorsports stable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our teammate is really on a roll right now,'' said Terry
Labonte, driver of the No. 5 Kellogg's Corn Flakes Chevrolet, who
entered last night's race ninth in the Winston Cup standings,
trailing Gordon by 780. ``We've seen that before with Rusty
Wallace, Darrell Waltrip, and now it's Jeff. They've just got
things figured out. They've got the right setups in the car, and
they unload with the right stuff. They're right when they get to
the track until the time they leave.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, in large part, has to do with the organizational
skills of crew chief Ray Evernham, the self-proclaimed ``chief
worrier of the Rainbow Warriors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a tremendous amount of confidence in my people,''
said Evernham. ``Our sport is like no other. In the NFL, if an
equipment guy puts the wrong cleats on a guy's shoes, he can change
them out real fast. Not in racing. There's virtually no room for
error. The best thing I can do is get the right people in the right
job, then stand back and let them go. If they tell me the car is
ready, I know it's ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry McReynolds, who switched to crew chief for Mike Skinner's
No. 31 Lowe's Chevrolet after starting the season with Earnhardt's
No. 3 Goodwrench Chevy, said, ``People ask me, what's the 24 car
doing? If I knew, we'd be applying it to the 3 and the 31. I think
the thing they're doing, they have put so many people in place who
specialize.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got one guy and all he does is look after the aero of
those race cars,'' he added. ``They've got three or four guys and
all they look at is the chassis. They've got specialized people
looking in specialized areas and it's just got every `i' dotted and
every `t' crossed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Needless to say, Jeff Gordon is driving with a vengeance on
every lap he's on the racetrack. He and Ray Evernham have a great
rapport with each other, but they've just covered every area down
to the pit crew. They've got a guy and all he does is look after
the pit crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you cover all your areas, it equals what they've done
over the past few years.''
</P>
<P>

   &UR; Kevin Lepage &LR; , &UR;  &LR; 36, of Shelburne, Vt., landed a huge break when
he was tabbed by Winston Cup owner  &UR; Jack Roush  &LR; to fill the seat
vacated by  &UR; Ted Musgrave  &LR; in the No. 16 Prime-star Ford. Lepage, a
veteran of the Busch North circuit who had made a jump up to Busch
Grand National, made his debut in the Roush entry last weekend at
Michigan. Next Sunday in the Country Music Television 300, Lepage
will become the first Vermont driver to start a Winston Cup race at
New Hampshire International Speedway. So what are his goals for the
remainder of his rookie Winston Cup season? ``Obviously, our main
goal _ and as a driver that's my goal every week _ is to go and win
a race,'' he said. ``If I don't feel I can win a race, then there's
no use in becoming a Winston Cup driver. What we need to do, I need
to get up in the top 10 and top five on a week-in-and-week-out
basis. If I can do that, then I think the wins will be right around
the corner.'' ... What happened to  &UR; Ricky Craven &LR; ? The native of
Newburgh, Maine, made a triumphant homecoming to NHIS last month by
winning the pole for the Jiffy Lube 300. It was a stirring moment
for Craven, who was back behind the wheel of his No. 50 Budweiser
Chevrolet after a three-month layoff to recover from postconcussion
syndrome. But, in a move that seemed to suggest he was not yet
fully healed, Craven resigned his ride and was replaced last week
by  &UR; Wally Dallenbach &LR; . In an interview before his NHIS return,
Craven said, ``I've worked 16 years to get to Hendrick Motorsports
and I'm not going to blow it like I almost did at Atlanta,''
referring to his 34th-place finish in the Primestar 500 March 8,
which was hampered by his condition. ``Driving a race car is
something I've done all my life. I've always tried to play hurt.
But that time off showed me you can't fake it when you're hurt;
either you're at 100 percent or you're not.'' ... Winston Cup
driver  &UR; Geoff Bodine  &LR; will bring a taste of the nation's
fastest-growing sport to the national pastime when he throws out
the first pitch at Yankee Stadium Tuesday. Bodine's No. 7 Phillips
Ford will be on display outside the park before the Yankees-Angels
game.

   Indy Racing League officials penalized  &UR; Team Menard  &LR; Friday for
violations that were discovered in a postrace inspection at last
weekend's Radisson 200 at Pikes Peak (Colo.) International Raceway.
The IRL fined Team Menard $25,000 and deducted 15 points apiece
from drivers  &UR; Robbie Buhl  &LR; and  &UR; Tony Stewart &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who fell out of the
points lead, after inspections revealed the rear wings of their
cars violated technical specifications. Stewart's deduction left
him in third place with 227 points and vaulted  &UR; Scott Sharp  &LR; from a
9-point deficit to a 1-point lead in IRL standings ahead of
Radisson 200 winner  &UR; Kenny Brack &LR; , &UR;  &LR; 233 to 232. ``After such a
great race at Pikes Peak last Sunday, it's very disappointing this
had to happen,'' said  &UR; Brian Barnhart &LR; , &UR;  &LR; IRL director of racing
operations. ... Despite running out of fuel in Turn 4 of the final
lap, Brack held on for his second IRL victory in a row at Pikes
Peak. Brack held off runner-up Buhl by a margin of 7.542 seconds to
pocket a $112,950 payday ...  &UR; Billy Boat &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who suffered a
fractured left leg and pelvis in a crash June 28 at NHIS, returned
to his  &UR; A.J. Foyt &LR; -prepared car at Pikes Peak and finished ninth
after starting on the pole position. ``We didn't have a ninth-place
race car,'' said Boat, who hobbled around the track on crutches.
``We had a top three-car. For the last few laps, I was just trying
to hang on and salvage a top-five. At least we ran all day. We'll
come back and try to get them at Atlanta (in the Atlanta 500
Classic Saturday).'' ...  &UR; Tom Carey &LR; , &UR;  &LR; of Orange, Mass., will try
to extend his lead over  &UR; Mike Stefanik  &LR; for the Busch North Series
title in next Saturday's CMT Twins 100 at NHIS. Carey will make his
fourth and final appearance of the season at NHIS after posting
second-, third-, and 12th-place finishes in his previous visits.
``I'd like to cap my season with a win (at NHIS),'' said Carey.
``That would prove I can go fast as well as steady, and maybe even
edge  &UR; Dale Shaw  &LR; (of Center Conway, N.H.) for the track
championship.'' ... Fun Ford Weekend will wrap up Sunday at New
England Dragway in Epping, N.H. There will be continuous drag
racing featuring classes of Fast Ford, Quick Ford, Street Ford,
Lightning Pickup, and the 5.0 Showdown series ... A titan of
sportswriting was lost a week ago when  &UR; Jim Murray  &LR; of the Los
Angeles Times died. Although baseball and golf were his biggest
loves, the genial columnist came to embrace auto racing as well. It
was at the Indianapolis 500 that he penned the famous line,
``Gentlemen, start your coffins!'' and where I had the great
fortune to know him by sitting across from him at Indy's media
center for the last 10 years. A true gentleman will be missed.

OLD TALE UNFOLDS AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roberto Duran says World Boxing Association middleweight
champion Willie Joppy will try to run from him next weekend. He had
best hope so.
</P>
<P>
   The aged Duran will drag his 47-year-old body into the ring at
the Las Vegas Hilton Saturday night to fight one last time for a
world title against a kid who hadn't even been born until Duran was
already 20-0 as a prizefighter.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year difference in their ages doesn't mean as much as it
used to. While Duran has fought everyone, Joppy has fought no one
and still managed to lose once. But this fight is not about who
Joppy is. It is about who Duran is not.
</P>
<P>
   He is not the Duran of 1972, when he savagely battered Ken
Buchanan to win the lightweight title with a 13th-round stoppage.
</P>
<P>
   He is not the Duran who defended that title so many times that
he is today considered one of the two best lightweights in history.
</P>
<P>
   He is not the Duran who gave Ray Leonard his first defeat in
1980, winning the welterweight title, or even the one who upset
Davey Moore so gloriously when everyone first thought he was
finished back in '83.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, he is not even the one who defeated Iran Barkley to win
the middleweight title in 1989 when he was already just a shadow of
himself but a glorious shadow.
</P>
<P>
   What he is now is a guy who goes the distance with fighters like
Jacque LeBlanc, loses twice to Vinny Pazienza and to Hector Camacho
and to Jorge Castro, and struggles to survive a preliminary kid
from England named Dave Radford, who was knocked out in one round
in his next fight.
</P>
<P>
   That is the Duran who will fight young Joppy, and even with his
102-13 record and five world titles as impressive baggage, it's
unlikely that Duran can catch this kid. And even if he does, he
might not be able to do anything with him anyway. Not because Joppy
is something special but because Duran no longer is.
</P>
<P>
   ``His fighting style resembles Sugar Ray Leonard's,'' Duran said
of Joppy. ``Running. The first couple of rounds he'll run.
Afterwards, he'll fight.''
</P>
<P>
   If Duran is counting on that, he's dreaming. Joppy (25-1-1)
hasn't knocked out anyone in nearly two years and it's unlikely
he's going to start trying with Duran unless he sees what so many
fear _ that this Duran is a paper tiger, a shell of a legend.
</P>
<P>
   That is what so many fight fans fear and why Duran's longtime
booking agent, Mike Acri, refused to agree to this fight when it
was first proposed. At the time, Acri said, ``I'm not getting Duran
beat by some kid who couldn't have carried his gym bag when he was
Duran for chump change.''
</P>
<P>
   But these days, with Panamanian and US tax men chasing Duran,
chump change is enough to keep him fighting. When he fought
Camacho, he made nearly a million dollars _ far more than he will
see Saturday night _ and the IRS took nearly all of it.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has tax attorneys waiting for him in Panama and Las
Vegas, so in the truest sense he does not fight for money now _
because he sees little or none of it. So why then does he go on at
all?
</P>
<P>
   ``It could open the door to bigger and better things,'' Duran
said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, boxing has no bigger or better things for
47-year-old former lightweights who now battle just to get to 160
pounds. It has only beatings and embarrassments, such as the sight
of Radford twice buckling the great Duran's knees with punches that
on another night never would have come close to touching him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to see what's coming one night,'' Marvin Hagler
said that night in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   We don't want to see it, but it may be coming whether we watch
or not. And the fact is we will.
</P>
<P>
   We will watch Duran when Showtime turns its cameras on him for
probably the last time because the battering of old champions by
new ones is as much a part of this sport as the glorious nights
Duran had so often.
</P>
<P>
   It is the sad part, but it is the part Duran now plays.
</P>
<P>
   The bit part.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, on this stage, it's also the hit part.
</P>
<P>

   &UR; Michael Scionti &LR; , &UR;  &LR; executive director of the Florida State
Athletic Commission, is under fire after lawyers for  &UR; Julio Cesar
Chavez  &LR; charged that his support of a commission rule change
beneficial to promoter  &UR; Don King  &LR; was the result of King's $100,000
donation to a nonprofit organization formed by Scionti last year.
Scionti recommended that the commission reverse a Florida
regulation prohibiting a fighter from being tied exclusively to one
promoter. The commission followed Scionti's recommendation last
Thursday, despite the claim by Chavez's attorney that Scionti was
``in the hip pocket of Mr. King.'' The foundation Scionti formed
was supposed to help boxers continue their education, and he
vehemently denied that he had been bought off by King. He said he
resigned from the foundation when King made his donation but
acknowledged that King's son,  &UR; Carl &LR; , &UR;  &LR; was on the foundation board
with him at the time. Chavez is still fighting to break his
promotional contract with King even as he prepares in Breckenridge,
Colo., for his Sept. 18 rematch with  &UR; Oscar De La Hoya  &LR; in Las
Vegas for rival promoter  &UR; Bob Arum &LR; . King contends he has exclusive
promotional rights to Chavez, a deal that up until Thursday would
have been illegal in Florida ... King got a win of a sorts in his
battle to retain control of International Boxing Federation
welterweight champion  &UR; Felix Trinidad &LR; . On Thursday, US District
Court judge  &UR; Lawrence McKenna  &LR; issued a preliminary order denying
the injunction against King that Trinidad sought. Trinidad recently
signed a promotional deal with  &UR; Dino Duva's  &LR; Main Events company,
claiming his exclusive deal with King had expired and that King had
repeatedly breached the contract. King countered, claiming Trinidad
extended the contract when he signed a bout agreement for a fight
with  &UR; Troy Waters &LR; . McKenna has ordered both sides to appear before
him Monday to consider the possibility of an expedited trial or an
evidentiary hearing ... Worcester welterweight  &UR; Jose Rivera  &LR; lost
his shot at some big-time exposure on HBO Boxing After Dark last
night when a torn ligament in his arm forced him to pull out of a
bout with No. 1-rated junior middleweight  &UR; Fernando Vargas &LR; . Rivera
was replaced by light-hitting  &UR; Darren Maciunski  &LR; (16-5, 6
KOs).Vargas (13-0, 13 KOs) is in line for a shot at IBF 154-pound
champion  &UR; Yory Boy Campas &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who must defend his title against
Vargas by December. Vargas's promoters believe Campas may vacate
the title if he appears to be in line for a shot at big money
against De La Hoya by the end of the year. If not, Campas-Vargas
could end up as the second half of a Nov. 14 HBO mega-show with
Trinidad in against World Boxing Association titleholder  &UR; Ike
Quartey  &LR; if he can extricate himself from King. For that to happen,
however, it's likely that Quartey would have to either give up the
WBA title or have it stripped from him for refusing to fight his
mandatory challenger,  &UR; Andrei Pastriev &LR; . Their recently scheduled
fight was canceled when Quartey claimed he caught malaria whie
training in Ghana. Fact is, he feared both death threats and the
warning of his former French promoters that they could not
guarantee his safety if he came to France to fight without them.

`JACK' HAS GOT IT ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. _ Stadium Envy. That's what I've got.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sitting in the cushy, air-conditioned press box at
one-year-old Jack Kent Cooke Stadium. I'm looking out at the
state-of-the-art football theater. It's got real grass, 80,116
seats with perfect sightlines, Crayola-clear scoreboards, 23,000
parking spaces, 1,100 televisions, a sound system that satisfied
Mick Jagger, and 199 luxury boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad Massachusetts House Speaker Thomas Finneran couldn't be
here to see this. The Jack was privately financed (to the tune of
$175 million) by the late Jack Kent Cooke, but he got help in the
form of $70.5 million from the state of Maryland for infrastructure
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar? The inimitable Bob (now Robert, for some strange
reason) Kraft offered to build his own stadium in Foxborough, but
wanted 72 million tax dollars for infrastructure, which included a
$20 million purchase of land for the stadium that the Patriots
would lease back to the state for an annual payment of $2.5
million. Kraft's plan was rejected by the Massachusetts House.
</P>
<P>
   And so the Patriots are condemned to an endless string of
seasons in Foxborough _ the Levittown of American stadia.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots brought their preseason show to Greater Washington
last night. In the wake of new terrorist threats, there was extra
security at National Airport and several Patriots players noticed
the new lines of defense when they took a White House tour Friday
afternoon. There was additional security around Jack Kent Cooke
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   New England players, media, and road-tripping fans could only
look at the new facility and drool. The Jack is beautiful. It's the
NFL's largest open-air stadium and the first built with private
funds since Joe Robbie Stadium (now Pro Player Stadium) went up in
1987. The Jack was built in 18 months and designed by HOK Inc., the
same folks who planned Camden Yards, Jacobs Field, and Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   Drawbacks? The Jack is not in downtown Washington ($30 by cab),
and is not on a metro line. It's also expensive, with an average
general-admission ticket exceeding $52, but this deters few. The
Redskins have sold out 237 consecutive games and there are 40,000
on the waiting list for season tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Cooke was 74 when he started trying to get out of old RFK
Stadium downtown and it took 10 years to find a site and fix the
financing. Like Kraft, he talked with officials from every part of
the region. Kraft works Massachusetts vs. Providence and Hartford.
Cooke at various times signed agreements with Virginia, Maryland,
and the District of Columbia. To his credit, Cooke never threatened
to take the Redskins to another part of the country. Sadly, he died
five months before the new stadium opened.
</P>
<P>
   There are 2,527 plumbing fixtures at the Jack (I didn't count
them myself; it's in the press guide). Something tells me Foxboro
Stadium doesn't have as many toilets and sinks. The Jack's got 12
miles of handrails and 52,000 gallons of new paint. Not content
with last year's sparkling success, the Redskins dumped another $25
million into stadium improvements for the upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
   The Jack was built on 300 acres that used to be called Wilson
Farm. There was resistance from some Landover neighbors, but the
county council favored the economic windfall. Cooke, who had an ego
even bigger than Kraft's, went so far as to get the postal service
to recognize the stadium land as Raljon, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Raljon has no residents. The word is a merge of the names of
Cooke's two sons, Ralph and John. Yeesh. And we think Kraft has an
ego.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, New England had better watch out. If Kraft
ever builds a stadium, maybe he'll be tempted to do what Cooke did
and create his own town _ Jondandavidjosh, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Kind of catchy, don't you think?

IT'S BIRD-WATCHING SEASON

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BALTIMORE _ Close your eyes and picture this. A huge crowd
overflowing Camden Yards. Happy, happy faces. Fans doing the wave
with a passion usually reserved for Baltimore Ravens games a block
away. People having a ball.
</P>
<P>
   Inhale the smells and hear the sounds. Look for little Orioles
everywhere, yelling and singing about their heroes, past and
present: Jim Palmer, Brooks Robinson, Cal Ripken, and now Eric
Davis, who inspires people every time he takes to the field.
</P>
<P>
   Now, open your eyes and see the reality of Birdland. It is no
illusion. There are the Baltimore Orioles, who long ago seemed to
fall out of contention for a playoff spot, in third place in the
American League East and closing. They are a traditional power,
with a $70 million payroll, and their loyal fans believe they can
catch the Red Sox for the AL wild-card spot, even though the
deficit stood at eight games entering Saturday's play.
</P>
<P>
   After an injury-plagued, 38-50 first half, the Orioles have
gotten themselves together, winning 31 of 41 games after the
All-Star break and erasing half of a 15 1/2-game deficit. But there
is still a long way to go; the Orioles close the season with two
games against New York, three in Toronto and four in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team is mostly healthy,'' says first baseman Rafael
Palmeiro. ``After the break, everybody decided to leave nothing out
on the field. Don't leave anything in the clubhouse. Have fun and
play the game. Once we did that, things started to happen. We
started saying that during the last Red Sox series. We went all out
and we swept them, and that's what gave us life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really almost like what happened to us in 1996,'' says
left fielder B.J. Surhoff, recalling how the Orioles overcame an
early-season deficit that year to win 98 games and take the
wild-card berth. ``We struggled for a long time after a good start
because of some injuries to our pitching staff. When we started to
get some people back, things started to come around a little bit
and we made the playoffs. That's about what has happened here.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is any doubt that the AL East is the toughest division
in baseball, consider that the Yankees, Red Sox, and Orioles could
finish with the top three records in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Depleted roster
</P>
<P>
   What a season it has been for the Orioles, who lost their Nos.
1, 3, and 4 pitchers for a total of 30 starts. Mike Mussina (six
missed starts), Scott Kamieniecki (12), and Jimmy Key (12) all have
been on the disabled list. Doug Drabek, the fifth starter, is there
now. The Orioles started the season 10-2 but soon came back to the
pack before collapsing with a nine-game losing streak in May as the
Yankees blew past them.
</P>
<P>
   While the sight of Davis, who has recovered from colon cancer,
has been heartwarming, there has been much ugliness associated with
the Orioles' season. On May 14, Mussina nearly lost an eye when he
was hit in the face by a line drive off the bat of Cleveland's
Sandy Alomar. Key has battled shoulder problems and is currently
working out of the bullpen. Reliever Arthur Rhodes strained his
elbow and missed an entire month. Outfielder Brady Anderson banged
up a knee last Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   And of course there was the infamous brawl in Yankee Stadium in
mid May that resulted in suspensions for the 1-2 bullpen punch of
Alan Mills (two games) and Armando Benitez (eight games). Manager
Ray Miller had to go to a bullpen by committee, one that includes
41-year-old Jesse Orosco, and it has worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes relievers and starters,'' said Miller. ``We lost
three starters and without them called upon 7-8 pitchers who might
have had one-inning roles. That meant you didn't have them for a
few days, which takes you out of the pitching sequence for the next
day. If that's what you have to do, that's what you have to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``You end up going through two months of bringing in the best
available guy, regardless of left or right, instead of putting
people where they can flourish. Since the break, the starting
pitching has been good. We're bringing in people where we were
supposed to and they are doing the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, whose connections as pitching coach go back to
Baltimore's glory days of the '70s and '80s. He knew he was in a
high-risk position succeeding Dave Johnson, who led Baltimore to 98
victories in 1996 and 1997 and got fired after being named manager
of the year last season. The pressure didn't bother him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took the job,'' says Miller, ``because I was afraid that
what we had here would be given to somebody else. I know how good
an organization we have. Davey did a good job of getting us back to
thinking the Orioles way _ good baseball fundamentals and getting
away from gimmick stuff. Just plain good baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take away a No. 1, 3, and 4 starter, as well as two
more pitchers, then you're going to get the heck kicked out of you.
It was fun for those two weeks, we had just eight pitchers, only
one of which was a veteran starter (Scott Erickson), playing all
those interleague games with no lefthanders in the bullpen; no
Harold Baines, no Robbie Alomar for 15 days. We worked our tails
off to hang in there. A lot of credit should go to (pitching coach)
Mike Flanagan, who worked harder for two months than I did over the
previous two years.''
</P>
<P>
   In his shuffling of pitchers, Miller thinks he may have saved
his bullpen for the stretch run and along the way found a valuable
starter in Sidney Ponson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stuck with the kids,'' he said. ``As a team, we went back
to the Orioles way of pushing people who have good years, finding
out who can play baseball or who can't, and rewarding those
people.''
</P>
<P>
   How will it end?
</P>
<P>
   The strong second half has silenced the criticism of Miller and
his veteran team. A 30-game hitting streak by Davis restored some
magic to Camden Yards. Another boost was acquiring righthander Juan
Guzman from the Blue Jays. How long can this run last? You never
know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally, you'd like to set up your team in a 162-game
season,'' says Ripken. ``But because of injuries, our team wasn't
as strong as we'd like it. But we have the nucleus of a very good
team. Now that we've got everybody in their roles, it's good to see
visible signs of us winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came to the Orioles, we were a very good team.
Then we went through a very difficult rebuilding process when we
weren't that good. Now, we've come back to the talent that can give
us a chance to win by the end of the year. That's all that anyone
can ask.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be all right,'' says Miller. ``We have a steep
hill to climb, but we've come a long way. Before I took the job, I
read about a bunch of high-priced egos. That's wrong. We have a
great bunch of guys on this club. Excellent baseball players.''
</P>
<P>
   Because they are a veteran team, says catcher Lenny Webster, the
Orioles are not going to lose their poise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody in this clubhouse let anybody get down
on themselves in the first half,'' says Webster. ``It's just
understanding the game and how nature takes its course when you're
out there battling your butt and trying to win a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like that Murphy's Law thing hit us. Anything that
could go wrong went wrong. We knew that it was a long season and we
had a second half to play. If we play the way that we are capable,
we'd be able to make a run at the wild card.''

SENIOR'S MELE GRADUATING TO PGA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD _ Peter Mele is a child of New England _ of Everett,
Waltham, Weston, and Raynham. He is an alumnus of Wake Forest, in
the same class as Scott Hoch and a year behind Curtis Strange. He
has been tournament director of the BankBoston Senior PGA Tour
event at Nashawtuc CC since 1988, and his involvement began four
years earlier. He approaches this week's tournament, which begins
Friday, with some nostalgia, because he is about to leave town.
</P>
<P>
   Mele will become tournament director for the PGA Tour's Buick
Classic at Westchester Country Club in Rye, N.Y. As he, wife
Barbara, daughter Lori, and son Peter Jr. prepare to move to
Southbury, Conn., Mele has been ensconced in organizing the senior
event, with its three pro-ams Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday
preceding Friday's opening round.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely mixed feelings,'' said Mele Thursday. ``It's
tough. I've been trying to figure out how to handle this over the
next 10 days. It's definitely going to be difficult. It's very
emotional. We've made so many friends here. We've got so many
memories. It all happened so suddenly nobody really had time to
think about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunity was too good. Everything was being held up
because of the GM strike affecting Buick. I'm going to an event
that's been around. Working for the PGA Tour has had an appeal to
me. It's such a great company to work with, and I know so many
people at headquarters.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the attraction is the fact that the PGA Tour is in the
midst of a major transformation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got so many things going on with the world golf
championships,'' said Mele. ``They're really in an expansion mode.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only part that's been difficult is the whole idea of
moving out of the area. We live in Raynham. The kids love the
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   The BankBoston field is just about as good as it can be. It
features defender Hale Irwin, who won the US Senior Open at Riviera
and is golf's leading money-winner this year ($2,101,750 on the
Senior Tour), plus Isao Aoki, Jay Sigel, David Graham, Graham
Marsh, Dave Stockton, Lee Trevino, Bob Murphy, George Archer, and
Dana Quigley.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, Nashawtuc is in fine shape despite flooding from the
Sudbury River in late June. Course superintendent Paul Miller and
his staff have done a remarkable job in getting the course ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``The end of June and the first week of July, we were still
under water,'' said Miller. ``The middle of 1. The whole eighth
fairway. The landing area on the ninth fairway. The rough all
around 16 was completely dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used bent grass and rye, about 200 pounds an acre of both.
We cut seed in at two or three different angles. We had 15 inches
of rain in the month.
</P>
<P>
   ``This damage couldn't have been much more severe.''

   Great sportswriter  &UR; Jim Murray &LR; , who died a week ago in Los
Angeles, loved golf. One of his columns concerned a relatively
obscure pro named  &UR; Ken Still  &LR; out of Tacoma, who qualified for the
1969 US Ryder Cup team. Murray wrote that the only time Still ever
saw his name in headlines was when San Francisco native  &UR; Ken
Ventura  &LR; led the 1966 US Open for the second straight day at the
Olympic Club and one of the hometown papers said, ``Ken still leads
Open.'' This reporter rode with Murray to this year's Open, which
he was covering for the fourth time at Olympic Club, and we had a
laugh over Mark Twain's remark that the coldest winter he ever
spent was a summer in San Francisco ... The Golf Skills Challenge
is seeking volunteers for its annual event (Aug. 28-30) at
Wedgewood Pines GC in Stow. Volunteers will receive lunch and an
opportunity to participate in the event free. If interested, call
the NEPGA (508) 869-0000 ... The NEPGA Pro-Am Championship that was
washed out in June will be played over 36 holes Tuesday at Andover
and Indian Ridge Country Clubs ... The New England Open at The
Quechee Club (Sept. 15-17) has pro-am openings for amateurs and
professionals not in the NEPGA but working full-time within New
England. The deadline is Aug. 31. Call (802) 295-6245 ... There are
a record number of applications (290) for the Massachusetts Golf
Association's Mid Amateur Championship at Nashawtuc (Sept. 22-23),
with just 200 spots available ... The first half of the MGA's team
for the Tri State matches involving teams from Connecticut and
Rhode Island has been selected. Ouimet winner  &UR; Frank Vana Jr. &LR; , &UR; Jon
Fasick &LR; , &UR; Jim Ruschioni &LR; , &UR; Kevin Quinn &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Ed Fletcher  &LR; will be
part of the Bay State contingent, which has won the past two years
...  &UR; Allen Doyle  &LR; out of Norwood, the oldest player to qualify for
the PGA Tour at 47, recently turned 50 and was granted one of four
sponsor's exemptions to the Senior event at Nashawtuc. The
remaining three spots were given to former Tufts athlete  &UR; Dan
Woods &LR; , &UR; Homero Blancas &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Ed Dougherty &LR; . Doyle, who turned 50
July 26 while playing in the CVS Charity Classic at Pleasant Valley
CC, was a Monday qualifier for the Senior event in Coon Rapids,
Minn. He had a 5-1 record in three Walker Cup matches, won the
celebrated Sunnehanna Amateur four times, and decided to go pro.
Now he's 50, and life begins at 50, doesn't it?

BONUS PUTS AN ONUS ON KRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While Ted Johnson was sweeping a pen across his new $25 million,
five-year contract extension last week during a press conference at
Foxboro Stadium, Patriots owner Bob Kraft was one floor below,
staring almost incredulously at a computer printout that listed his
team's signing-bonus obligations.
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom of a long list of names _ topped by the $8 million
Kraft committed to Johnson this week _ was a figure in bold type.
</P>
<P>
   That figure was $35,688,000.
</P>
<P>
   It is a big number, even for a guy who spends most of his waking
hours around big numbers. For the long-term future of the Patriots,
it was the kind of number Kraft believes he can't keep writing if
something doesn't change soon with his stalled stadium project.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft's reasoning is simple economics, the stuff he was taught
years ago at Harvard Business School, the same stuff taught to his
eldest son, Jonathan, a generation later:
</P>
<P>
   You don't spend more than you take in every year, because if you
do, one year they'll be taking you out. In a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   With the signing of Johnson, the Patriots have now committed the
triangle of their defensive front _ Johnson, Chris Slade, and
Willie McGinest _ to long-term deals that give head coach Pete
Carroll people to build around for the future. But with a total of
$35,688,000 in signing-bonus commitments this season and no
commitment from anyone to help him with a new stadium project,
Kraft sees his own future differently, and what he sees is not
good.
</P>
<P>
   The need to continue paying such bonuses is the driving force
behind Kraft's search for a new stadium that will provide him a
revenue stream he believes can keep his team competitive. Without
it, he feels, he will be unable to continue paying the up-front
money needed to sign top free agents, including his own, and his
team will slowly sink into mediocrity. That, not Foxborough, is
what he fears getting stuck in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be in the NFL if I can't be competitive, and
the fact is I can't keep taking capital we can't generate and
spending it to keep the team competitive,'' Kraft said. ``We're
socialists in this league. We share all the revenue the same. The
only way to differentiate is stadium income. The fact of the matter
is simple. I can't keep infusing capital into this business knowing
this gap will get bigger and bigger if things stay the way they
are.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way the team stays competitive is if you do that, and
it takes cash to sign these guys. I think some people have missed
the point in this. Having a new stadium isn't about me making
money. I already make a lot of money in my real businesses. A new
stadium is about the team remaining competitive in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hugh Culverhouse, when he owned the Buccaneers, made more
money than anybody else because his teams were seldom competitive.
If I wanted to make some money at this, I'd be better off
financially to be 8-8 every year. Frankly, you go to the
championship game or the Super Bowl and you lose money.''
</P>
<P>
   Odd as that may sound, it has been backed up in the past by
people such as Eddie DeBartolo, who experienced it over and over
again in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Even the kind of guy who would use public money to finance a
minor league baseball park in Lowell but deny it for a major league
team in Boston (say, a guy like Tom Finneran) must understand that
NFL owners could make more taking the money they invest in pro
football and putting it into a real business. They could make more
investing in real estate or any other real business that runs like
a real business, one in which you don't hand over 60 percent of the
gross to the employees and pay millions to kids for what they may
do rather than for what they've done.
</P>
<P>
   So the theory that Kraft wants a stadium to get rich is as
specious as saying everything he does is an act of Christian
charity. As Finneran pointed out in his politically incorrect and
rather blunt way, Kraft is already rich. He needs football to eat
off like he needs another community meeting in South Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft's desire for a public/private stadium partnership is as
simple as the economics staring him in the face at the bottom of
that computer printout.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't like to own a loser, his fans don't like to watch a
loser, and the area doesn't like to hear about losers. Nearly
everybody, sports nut or not, is energized by a winning team, but
only one guy _ in this case Kraft _ has to pay for one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been willing to commit to this (bonus structure) because
I always felt we could get a stadium here,'' Kraft said. ``I still
hope we can. But you can't keep spending your capital like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, you move to a place such as Los Angeles,
where Kraft would make more capital in a week than a new stadium in
New England would net him in a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   The supposition in these parts is that if Kraft goes, he goes to
Providence or at worst Hartford, although he does not have a deal
from either yet. That's what Finneran is betting on and what most
pundits expect.
</P>
<P>
   But just 5 1/2 hours away by plane lies a gold mine for someone.
Bob Kraft knows that, too.
</P>

   One week  &UR; Glenn Foley  &LR; is the Jets' starting quarterback. The
next week he's told by his boss,  &UR; Bill Parcells &LR; , &UR;  &LR; ``You're the
other guy now.'' He takes that to mean he's  &UR; Neil O'Donnell &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the
guy he replaced last season. But when  &UR; Vinny Testaverde  &LR; got the
next start, he opened his career with the Jets in the way much of
his 11 years in the NFL have gone. He threw an interception and his
team lost, 33-0. Just like that, Parcells was saying last week that
Foley was his guy all along, blaming the New York media for
inventing a quarterback controversy where, of course, none existed
anywhere but in their twisted minds. Regardless of Parcells's
wavering, Foley is now the guy again, after going 14 of 22 for 192
yards and a touchdown against the Giants Thursday night. Prior to
that game, he was a dismal 11 for 28 with two interceptions and had
shown little of the fire he exhibited by completing 14 straight
against the Patriots in a game last season that began O'Donnell's
demise. If that Foley does not reappear this season, the Jets will
go nowhere and Parcells knows it _ with or without  &UR; Curtis Martin
 &LR; running full steam ahead, as he appeared to be doing Thursday
night. That is why Parcells reminded Foley and everyone else last
week, ``They play until I don't want them to play anymore.'' This
led someone to ask Parcells whether the uncertainty was making
Foley ill at ease. Obviously, the questioner didn't know much about
Parcells. ``I'm not worried about being at ease,'' Parcells
snapped. ``I'm not at ease. How the hell can he be at ease? What is
this, a mental health clinic?'' Considering that Testaverde's
winning percentage in 132 career starts is .367, second-lowest
among active quarterbacks, many in New York will be ill at ease if
Foley doesn't prove to be the guy Parcells thought he was ... The
Patriots are one of nine teams facing possible travel problems
because of an impending pilots strike against Northwest Airlines
that could begin next weekend if a deal isn't struck. The Patriots,
who charter their flights from Northwest, are now planning a
contingency in which they would lease the equipment from Northwest
and hire an outside charter service to operate the plane until the
strike is over.

   Representatives of the seven groups seeking the NFL's expansion
franchise in Cleveland made presentations at a brief owners meeting
in Atlanta last week, but none delivered their financial packages.
The bids remained under seal in New York at the investment firm
Goldman Sachs, but all seven had been judged to have made a minimum
bid high enough to allow them to address the owners. An Expansion
Committee of seven owners will work with Goldman Sachs to reduce
the candidates to 2-4 finalists. They will then present to the 30
owners their final bids, which can be submitted as late as Sept. 7,
the night before a scheduled final vote. Kraft is on the Expansion
Committee and said, ``The numbers are pretty important, but it's
possible that the highest bidder won't get it. Regardless, we'll be
selling the franchise for the highest price ever paid in sports.''
Kraft said the decision to bring in Goldman Sachs was one he
supported because of his own experience when he bought the Patriots
in 1994. ``They sold me the team and did a heck of a job,'' he
said. Although one of the bidders,  &UR; Al Lerner &LR; , &UR;  &LR; has a close
relationship with top Goldman Sachs executives, Kraft said, ``Five
of the seven guys involved in these proposals know the people
there, so that's not a problem.'' Kraft went on to praise
commissioner  &UR; Paul Tagliabue's  &LR; handling of the situation in
Cleveland saying, ``He took a situation that was horrible because
in the end there was a deadlock between the ownership of the Browns
and the political people there. They had the best fan base in the
league outside our own, and now to come back to Cleveland with a
state-of-the-art stadium he had to pull off a public/private
partnership and he did. It couldn't be done here, I don't think.
Over the next 10 years, the NFL will be bringing a billion in
revenue into Cleveland that wouldn't otherwise be there through
national sponsorships and TV revenue and taxes. If, in the end, we
go 3,000 miles from here, that's where that revenue will go. The
political people in Cleveland understood that.'' Expansion
franchises in Carolina and Jacksonville went for $140 million in
1993, Kraft bought the Patriots for $160 million, and last week
 &UR; Red McCombs's  &LR; $250 million offer to buy the Vikings was accepted.
Numbers from $400 million to $1 billion have been thrown around as
the cost of the Cleveland franchise. McCombs says the whole thing
is a mystery: ``Nobody knows what these things are really worth.''
... Among the seven Cleveland bidders was Bruins owner  &UR; Jeremy
Jacobs &LR; , who said he did not believe cross-ownership is a problem
and stated flatly that he would not sell the Bruins to obtain the
Browns. Jacobs is not the only NHL owner in the hunt.  &UR; Howard
Milstein &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who owns 45 percent of the New York Islanders, heads a
group that includes former NFL stars  &UR; Paul Warfield  &LR; and  &UR; Calvin
Hill &LR; . Another bidder,  &UR; Richard Jacobs &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who owns the Cleveland
Indians, made some points simply by using only 15 of his alloted 30
minutes to make his pitch.

   Things are flush in the NFL, as Fox is learning. The television
network is asking for and getting $1.6 million for a 30-second spot
on its Super Bowl broadcast next January. That is a 23 percent
increase on what NBC charged last season and partially the result
of NBC getting $1.7 million a spot for its ads on the final episode
of ``Seinfeld.'' Fox is arguing that ``Seinfeld'' did a 41.3 rating
while last year's Super Bowl did a 44.5 ...  &UR; Ironhead Heyward
 &LR; begged the St. Louis Rams to release him but head coach  &UR; Dick
Vermeil  &LR; has thus far refused and sources say he will stand his
ground at least until Heyward reports to training camp. The bulky
fullback was told to be at 260 pounds this summer but was so far
off that he refused to come into camp and is being fined $5,000 a
day. To date, that totals $145,000 and his continued absence could
jeopardize the four-year, $4.5 million contract he signed just two
years ago. Heyward, who has struggled with his weight throughout
his career, is said to be offended both by Vermeil's harsh
practices and his harsh words. Earlier this summer, Vermeil
suggested Heyward ``cut the teeth off his fork,'' after the
fullback showed up for a mini-camp at nearly 300 pounds. On Friday,
Heyward told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch to tell Vermeil ``let me
go, please. Put the emphasis on the word please.'' Judging by
Vermeil's response, that didn't seem to change his position.
``You've got to sell a lot of Zest to make his kind of money,''
Vermeil said. Heyward has done several television ads for that soap
... On the same day that McCombs's purchase of the Vikings closed,
club president  &UR; Roger Headrick  &LR; quietly resigned. Present club vice
president  &UR; Jeff Diamond &LR;  is believed to be in line to take over the
day-to-day operation. Diamond negotiated most of the big-money
deals the Vikings made this offseason with their top players. When
McCombs's bid was accepted, one of the first things he did was go
into the locker room at training camp and ask wide recevier  &UR; Cris
Carter  &LR; to stand up. ``I want to see what my money looks like,''
McCombs told Carter, whom the Vikings made the highest-paid
receiver ... But Carter won't have the distinction for long. The
Lions are trying to iron out details with the league to get cap
approval for a contract extension that will make  &UR; Herman Moore  &LR; the
highest-paid receiver.

   The Chiefs may be one of the favorites to win the AFC title but
they're looking a little desperate as they pursue troubled running
back  &UR; Lawrence Phillips &LR; . &UR;  &LR; The Chiefs began negotiations with
Phillips's agent last week in large part because of the lackluster
play of  &UR; Donnell Bennett &LR; , &UR;  &LR; whom they shifted from fullback to
replace the retired  &UR; Marcus Allen  &LR; and the departed  &UR; Greg Hill &LR; .
Coach  &UR; Marty Schottenheimer  &LR; wants to meet with Phillips, who has
already been released by the Rams and Dolphins only three years
after St. Louis made him the sixth player taken in the draft ...
With defensive tackle  &UR; Tim Bowens  &LR; accepting the Dolphins' one-year
tender offer of $2.88 million after being tagged as their franchise
player, there are now four franchise players holding out. The
Redskins are trying to land one of them, New Orleans defensive end

COMETS TAKE PLAYOFF OPENER IN DEFENSE OF WNBA TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ The format for the Women's National Basketball
Association playoffs may have changed, but the defending champion
Houston Comets looked the same Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, which won the league's single-elimination tournament
last season, got 27 points from Cynthia Cooper and a strong effort
from its interior defense Saturday to defeat the Charlotte Sting by
85-71 in the opener of a two-of-three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets can eliminate Charlotte with a victory Monday night
in Houston. If a third game is necessary, it will be played Tuesday
in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would love to go back home and close it out in two games,''
said forward Sheryl Swoopes, who had 17 points and 8 rebounds
Saturday. ``That will give us a little more time to rest. I can
heal. Cynthia can heal. Kim can heal. The entire team can heal.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper and Swoopes had ice bags on sore knees after the game,
while Kim Perrot walked in for the post-game interviews with ice on
a sprained right ankle that had threatened to keep her out of the
game. She injured the ankle in the final regular-season game,
against Los Angeles on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about as bad as you'll ever see on Wednesday night,''
Houston Coach Van Chancellor said. ``I would have bet anything I
had that she wouldn't have played a minute today.''
</P>
<P>
   She actually played 38 minutes, tying Tina Thompson for the most
on the team. Perrot was 5 of 8 from the field, had 6 assists and 3
steals, and directed a Houston offense that started the game from
the perimeter and finished it in fast-break form.
</P>
<P>
   Her performance left Charlotte coach Marynell Meadors wondering
whether Houston had found a miracle cure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Perrot is hurt,'' Meadors said. ``If she did
sprain an ankle, I would like to know what kind of medication they
used to get her back. I didn't see any difference in her play.''
</P>
<P>
   Meadors' pain came from watching her team's perimeter game. When
the Sting got to the basket on fast breaks, it could score.
Otherwise, it was a struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte shot 15.4 percent (2-13) from 3-point range. Houston
did not sizzle from there, but the Comets shot well enough (6 of
24) to open the court for its running game.
</P>
<P>
   That enabled Houston to shoot 52.5 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Yolanda Moore's defense that made the difference.
Charlotte's Ronda Mapp made 7 of 10 field goals and scored 16
points, but it would have been much more without Moore's efforts,
Chancellor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep thinking Yolanda Moore is not big enough to guard Ronda
Mapp,'' Chancellor said. ``But every time we made that switch, she
did a good job of denying her the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston's other inside players bothered Charlotte throughout the
game when the Sting tried to power the ball to the basket. And the
Comets' 35-20 rebounding advantage made a big difference late in
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down the stretch, the Charlotte Sting did not rebound the ball
well enough to stop their runs,'' Meadors said. ``It seemed like we
were in a position all the time of having to fight from behind. Had
we got the lead, we would have played a little better.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Comets have made a strong first step in the search of
their second straight title. Chancellor said he did not change his
approach because of the new format, but he conceded he felt a lot
more pressure having to start this series on Charlotte's home
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go on the road for a first game, there is a lot of
pressure,'' he said. ``But our team has never thought about
defending the championship. We didn't change anything. We just said
let's go to Charlotte. Forget about the playoff format. Forget
about anything. Throw the ball up and let's get after it. That
sounds awfully canned, but it's a fact.''  &QL;

SOME YANKEES KEEP THE FAITH IN PRAYER GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Scott Brosius is chatting to a reporter about
the fraying of his baseball glove when he sees his teammate Chad
Curtis approaching. ``Fifty-five,'' Curtis says to Brosius, who
nods and glances at a nearby clock before resuming his
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis moves around the clubhouse, dispensing the same
information, to Joe Girardi to Homer Bush to Mike Stanton and Andy
Pettitte and others. At 55 minutes past the hour on this day, or at
whatever time is set, a group of New York Yankees retreat into an
empty room, and for 10 to 15 minutes they might discuss matters of
faith or inspiration, or a reading they have shared, or ask for
prayers. Every day they gather.
</P>
<P>
   The sharing of faith or prayer is not uncommon in baseball or
other sports. But the Yankees' group is unusual in that it meets
every day, and that it seems to exist seamlessly within the fabric
of the team. Players who don't participate appear wholly
comfortable with those who do meet. Those among the group mention
their faith only when asked.
</P>
<P>
   Girardi is a personal and devoted catcher for David Cone, not
part of the group. Tim Raines, who does not participate,
good-naturedly teases those who do, and in turn, he is teased, and
they seem to be at ease with each other, unthreatened and
unbothered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best go-with-the-flow team I've ever been on,'' said
Cone, referring to the players' tolerance of each other, religious
and otherwise. ``It's a very cohesive team, we all respect each
other, and we all respect each other's beliefs. There's no conflict
whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone has been on teams, he acknowledged, where this was not the
case. ``Not only with religion issues, but what music is played in
the clubhouse, what's on the television sometimes before the
game,'' Cone said. ``There are different divisive issues that
sometimes enter into a clubhouse. This team almost disallows
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankees manager Joe Torre agreed. ``Everybody's an individual
with their own beliefs, and it's important that is respected.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis organized the meetings early this year, after noticing
that the Yankees had a number of players with belief in various
denominations of Christianity. Pettitte is Baptist, for example,
while Curtis chooses not to be part of a specific denomination, and
George Rose, Hideki Irabu's interpreter, is Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   To bridge the many faiths, Curtis said, they all agreed that
``we're not going to talk about the differences'' in the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to focus on what's central,'' Curtis said, ``that
Jesus is who He says He was.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Pettitte: ``In today's world you see so many people argue
about so many different religions, and everybody in our group is
from a different religious background. But we all love the Lord and
that's all that matters. There's no sense in fighting or having
divisions. I don't think that's what the Lord wants us to be
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis is serious and introspective, an intense listener. When
batting, he stares at a pitcher, focusing on the pitcher and only
the pitcher; he engages in conversation the same way, the hard
visual examination. He speaks in a low and assuring voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the same core beliefs,'' Curtis said, referring to
those in the group. ``We find that's our strength. Not for
baseball, but for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis says that because of what surrounds him every day _ the
expectations for performance, the stress _ he finds a need for a
counter-balance, a reminder of what should be important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried to surround myself with people and bathe my mind
and my soul in what I really want to be evident in my life,'' said
Curtis, ``which is the word of God, and what I've found on this
team is that there are others who have that same desire.''
</P>
<P>
   Religion, says Pettitte, is an important part of his life and he
carries and reads a Bible daily. ``These meetings are just another
way for me to get closer to the Lord,'' said Pettitte. ``We get
together on the road sometimes, maybe like an hour or so, watch a
video and then talk about it. It gives us time for fellowship _
there's so much negative going on in this world, and it gives us
something positive getting together.''
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte says he would practice his faith regardless of whether
it differed from the beliefs of his teammates. ``This is important
to me,'' said Pettitte. ``We do this privately and it's something
we're going to do. We feel like it helps us. I could see if we were
doing it in the middle of the clubhouse, that might bother other
people. But we are private about this and anybody who wants to come
in is invited.''
</P>
<P>
   Players on this team almost never make religious references when
discussing their own performance or a result on the field. If he
pitches a shutout, Pettitte does not attribute this to an act of
God.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most you'll hear me say is to thank God for keeping me
healthy,'' said Pettitte. ``I mean, God doesn't care how many wins
I have. That's not a concern of his. What matters is that I'm being
a good servant to him and I'm helping other people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my job and I thank him for letting me do this job and
I've just got to go out and do my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis said: ``There are definitely people who assume we are
trying to get favor from God on the field. Am I going to take what
I believe, am I going to take this God and turn him into a good
luck charm? Am I going to say this is the God who gives me base
hits? It's not that. That's trivializing God. It's the God who
gives me life.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis used to play with Tony Fernandez in Cleveland and
recalled that last year, Fernandez thanked God after he hit a
game-winning home run in the playoffs _ and then thanked God again
after making a decisive error in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me,'' Curtis said, ``that's honoring and glorifying.''

CONTIGUGLIA TO LEAD U.S. SOCCER FEDERATION; NOW HE MUST PICK
COACH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Va.)   (bl)  
 By JACK BELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Soccer Federation elected Dr. Bob
Contiguglia as its new president Saturday, ending the eight-year
reign of Alan Rothenberg.
</P>
<P>
   At its annual general meeting, conducted in Hawaii, Contiguglia,
a 56-year-old kidney specialist from Denver, defeated Larry Monaco,
a 60-year-old former government lawyer from suburban Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Contiguglia will have no honeymoon. While the election of a new
president was top item on the agenda, the selection of a new men's
national team coach is certainly next. The job has been vacant
since Steve Sampson resigned after the United States' dismal result
at the 1998 World Cup in France.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really don't have a set date yet for hiring a national team
coach,'' Contiguglia said via a conference call. ``International
experience is a big factor, but we don't have to make a decision
right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Rothenberg had said he would name a new coach before he
departed from a list that has been shortened to Bruce Arena, coach
of Major League Soccer's D.C. United, and Bora Milutinovic, the
former United States coach.
</P>
<P>
   Rothenberg later retracted that and said the coach would be
picked by the executive committee, of which Rothenberg remains an
influential member.
</P>
<P>
   Rothenberg, an attorney, successfully directed the soccer
tournament at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games. In 1990, he was
handpicked by FIFA, the sport's world governing body, to run
against Werner Fricker. FIFA had grown weary of Fricker's progress
organizing the 1994 World Cup tournament, which was in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Under Rothenberg's stewardship, the United States staged the
most financially successful World Cup tournament (it made a $50
million profit, $7 million of which went to Rothenberg as a bonus),
helped launch Major League Soccer (he leads a group that recently
bought the San Jose franchise for $20 million) and guided the
federation into multimillion-dollar deals with Nike, International
Management Group and other corporations. He leaves behind an
organization with a $40 million budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus of the election and of my campaign is to continue
the direction that Alan has taken the federation,'' Contiguglia
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now want to focus on building up from the bottom, in
coaching, refereeing and in developing players.''

COMPANY MARKETS LIE DETECTOR SOFTWARE USING ISRAELI MILITARY
TECHNOLOGY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARITA, Calif. -- Plenty of folks would like to strap
President Clinton into a lie detector and test his veracity. But
how about putting a spouse, friend or co-worker through the same
procedure?
</P>
<P>
   Valencia Entertainment, a company best known for providing sound
stages to action-adventure television series, is marketing a
software package it claims can, with 85 percent accuracy, tell if a
person is lying. The $179 program is based on algorithms the
company says were developed for the Israeli military to identify
would-be terrorists at security checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a toy or a game; it's an investigative tool,''
said Dean Mauro, VE's president for new media. ``Still, it's
incredibly user-friendly. You can use it any time you need some
extra confidence in making a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauro would not say how much VE paid for the North American
rights to Truster, which it licenses from an Israeli software
house. But between licensing fees and marketing expenses, the firm
has so far spent about $2 million on the program, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Electronics distributors say if the company can sell 60,000
copies of Truster, it should be considered a financial success. But
VE officials have bigger plans. ``I'd like to see 500,000 units
sold,'' Mauro said. ``I don't think that's out of the question.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of Truster or similar programs installed on
thousands of home and business PCs, however, worries traditional
polygraph specialists. They argue that even if the technology is
sound _ which many of them question _ untrained individuals
convinced they can divine another's honesty are a recipe for
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were being marketed as a novelty, that would be one
thing,'' said Frank Horvath, a criminology professor at Michigan
State University's School of Criminal Justice. ``But people will
use this for making real-life serious decisions, believing it
really works.''
</P>
<P>
   Truster's developers insist it does work _ by analyzing the
stress in a person's voice.
</P>
<P>
   The software's assumption is that the human voice involuntarily
changes frequency when a speaker is under the sort of stress
associated with lying. Though the changes are inaudible to the
average listener, Truster can pick out and interpret the
fluctuations, its developers say. And because they've made the
program a sort of polygraph for dummies, there is no need for
extensive training, they say.
</P>
<P>
   After installing Truster on a PC and plugging a telephone into
the computer's microphone jack, a user is ready to begin quizzing
those on the other end of the phone line. One could, for example,
try to find out if a used-car salesman is playing fair. After
phoning the dealer and engaging the person in a relaxed
conversation _ during which Truster generates a base line profile
of the dealer's voice _ the user can go for the jugular.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of text and dialogue (salespeople) throw at you means
nothing'' and will therefore generate little response from Truster,
Mauro said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So do something to get it personal. I'd be very specific. For
this particular dealer you're working with, say, `Are you telling
me, here on the phone right now, that this is absolutely the best
possible price?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Unless the person is a pathological liar, Mauro said, the voice
should betray some extra stress or excitement when lying.
</P>
<P>
   As a user poses questions to its subject, Truster returns one of
eight interpretations: truth, false statement, inaccuracy, subject
is not sure, excitement, high excitement, outsmart and avoidance.
</P>
<P>
   (2nd TAKE TO FOLLOW)
</P>
<P>
   (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   What concerns polygraph specialists is whether Truster's makers
are, well, telling the truth about its abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computer voice stress analyzers attempt to report voice stress
modulation. And simply put, the statistics clearly suggest they
lack reliability,'' said Joseph Buckley, president of John E. Reid
and Associates Inc., a Chicago-based firm that specializes in
investigative interviewing and interrogation techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Even VE's own tests seem inconclusive. An analysis of Clinton's
statements on the Monica Lewinsky affair found the president to be
highly excited but truthful when he denied sexual relations with
the intern, the company said before Monday's televised
confessional.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand, (Truster's) response was based on what
Clinton determines a sexual relationship is,'' Mauro said. ``He
probably didn't have one in his own mind.''
</P>
<P>
   A follow-up test on Clinton's confession found the president to
be highly stressed throughout but mostly honest, Mauro said.
Truster raised a red flag at Clinton's statement that the
Whitewater issue was behind him, and it said the president was
unsure on the assertion that setting things straight with his
family and God was his top priority.
</P>
<P>
   While traditional polygraph tests record and analyze a variety
of vital signs, including pulse, respiration and blood pressure,
Truster relies on a single signal. And its critics say that makes
it an inherently less reliable source of data.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some evidence to suggest there may be something in
vocal signals that could be extracted that's useful, but there's no
evidence Truster or any other program has any value or is able to
do this,'' Horvath said.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean Truster won't be a hit with consumers, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually think people are going to gobble it up,'' Horvath
said. ``People want to believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Should Truster flourish, legal experts say its use will almost
certainly be challenged in court. While Mauro said it is legal to
test a person without the person's knowledge as long as the
conversation is not recorded, others contend that state and federal
statutes protect against the use of polygraph tests in many
circumstances. And because Truster claims to fill the same basic
function as a polygraph, the laws would likely cover its use as
well.
</P>
<P>
   In California, state law also guarantees residents' privacy,
said Catherine Fisk, an associate professor of law at Loyola
Marymount University. ``Arguably, conducting some kind of honesty
test through a voice stress analyzer without telling the person
might violate that privacy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, VE is targeting the business sector. Mauro said the
company has gotten calls from insurance agencies, credit card
companies, lawyers and job placement firms wanting to buy copies.
Two distribution firms VE has hired to get the software onto store
shelves say they have deals pending with retailers including Office
Max, Office Depot and Fry's Electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Office Max confirmed the chain is in preliminary
talks with VE about carrying Truster. Office Depot did not return
telephone calls to confirm the chain's interest, and a Fry's
official declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   VE is also in the process of trying to develop a television
series based on the Truster technology, Mauro said _ maybe a game
show or reality-based drama.
</P>
<P>
   And ultimately the home user remains the largest market of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wide open,'' Mauro said. ``This is not a male or female
product. A computer lie detection system can work in anybody's
life.''

 &HT;    Gingrich unruffled at GOP fund-raiser
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vashon Island, Wash. _ A funny thing happened on the way to
Saturday's Republican picnic on the estate of a man who admitted to
violating federal election law and paid a $5 million fine.
</P>
<P>
   With the attendance of Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), still
paying a $300,000 penalty for House ethics transgressions, the
picnic could have been a Democratic dream event and a motivator for
the fall elections in which Democrats hope to pick up at least two
congressional seats in the state.
</P>
<P>
   But emboldened by President Clinton's troubles and reassured by
the thousands of men, women and children who crossed Puget Sound by
ferry for free food, games and music, Republicans were almost
defiant about the Seattle-area GOP's annual picnic at the home of
Thomas Stewart, chief executive of Food Services of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose it's OK for Democrats to do this and get away with
it. One of our boys gets nailed and it's a different story,'' said
Mike Geer, 53, of Seattle, who pitched a handout from protesting
Democrats into a trash can as the ferry plied the sound's placid
waters. ``Why don't we get Clinton to pay the costs of the
investigation for the last seven months?''
</P>
<P>
   Even a stalwart of campaign finance reform, Rep. Linda Smith
(R-Wash.), said she felt comfortable at Stewart's estate, just five
months after Stewart admitted disguising $100,000 in campaign
contributions in his employees' names. Stewart, the Washington
GOP's largest contributor, also finished two months of home
detention in late May.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a mistake. He paid the consequences and he was
restored to society,'' said Smith, who is running for the U.S.
Senate. ``We could maybe have the president take his example.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gingrich kept himself walled off from reporters
after arriving by private helicopter in the morning. Imbuing the
day with a touch of the bizarre, he began a quest to get in the
Guinness Book of Records for most photographs taken with different
people at a single political event.
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon, Gingrich was approaching 2,000 photographs,
spokesman Mike Shields said. Wearing jeans and an open-necked
pin-striped shirt, the speaker took only brief breaks from a
grueling pace of a picture every six seconds. That would amount to
600 photos an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The tally could form the basis of a new category in the record
book, Shields said. A man and a woman each holding counters sat
near Gingrich and clicked each photo.
</P>
<P>
   Shields sought to portray the controversy over Stewart as a
local matter. ``We just responded to a request from the
congressional delegation and the party,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats tried to score political points from the event. At the
ferry dock, several carried placards, including one that read,
``Tom and Newt, Brothers in Crime.'' A few protesters greeted
school buses that carried picnickers from the ferry to the estate.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Democratic party Chairman Paul Berendt said, ``Can
you believe it? They are beholden to this man (Stewart) for his
contributions.''
</P>
<P>
   But his Republican counterpart, Dale Foreman, said the small
group of protesters was an indication that Clinton's equivocations
about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky already have sapped
Democrats' spirits.
</P>
<P>
   While it was hard to find anyone at the picnic who was not a
Republican, politics seemed the last thing on the mind of many of
those in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   As they finished a lunch of hot dogs and hamburgers with their
two young children, Monica and Bob Desroches of Seattle shared a
laugh when asked about the sign-waving Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're missing a good meal,'' he said.

 &HT;    Gingrich unruffled at GOP fund-raiser
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vashon Island, Wash. _ A funny thing happened on the way to
Saturday's Republican picnic on the estate of a man who admitted to
violating federal election law and paid a $5 million fine.
</P>
<P>
   With the attendance of Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), still
paying a $300,000 penalty for House ethics transgressions, the
picnic could have been a Democratic dream event and a motivator for
the fall elections in which Democrats hope to pick up at least two
congressional seats in the state.
</P>
<P>
   But emboldened by President Clinton's troubles and reassured by
the thousands of men, women and children who crossed Puget Sound by
ferry for free food, games and music, Republicans were almost
defiant about the Seattle-area GOP's annual picnic at the home of
Thomas Stewart, chief executive of Food Services of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose it's OK for Democrats to do this and get away with
it. One of our boys gets nailed and it's a different story,'' said
Mike Geer, 53, of Seattle, who pitched a handout from protesting
Democrats into a trash can as the ferry plied the sound's placid
waters. ``Why don't we get Clinton to pay the costs of the
investigation for the last seven months?''
</P>
<P>
   Even a stalwart of campaign finance reform, Rep. Linda Smith
(R-Wash.), said she felt comfortable at Stewart's estate, just five
months after Stewart admitted disguising $100,000 in campaign
contributions in his employees' names. Stewart, the Washington

KILLER'S BULLETS HIT FAMILY'S DREAMS

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Dennis McCarthy is a columnist for the Los Angeles Daily News.) 
By DENNIS MCCARTHY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- So, what was it?
</P>
<P>
   A gang initiation murder? A drive-by? Or were you just ``out
hunting,'' as the cops call it?
</P>
<P>
   Why'd you do it? Why'd you mess up one fine family, end one fine
life?
</P>
<P>
   In case you give a damn, the kid you killed was named Julio
Cano. He was 20, and would have been 21 in a couple of months.
</P>
<P>
   He was out jogging in the pre-dawn hours Sunday morning on the
streets of Pacoima because that was the only time he had to stay in
shape.
</P>
<P>
   When you're working two full-time jobs trying to help your
father support your mother and four brothers and sisters, you take
what time you can steal for yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Julio's time was 4 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   He'd get up as quietly as he could, so as not to wake up the
rest of his family living in the cramped, two-bedroom apartment on
Van Nuys Boulevard in Pacoima.
</P>
<P>
   His running clothes were already laid out in the living room.
He'd dress quickly and hit the streets for a five-mile or so run
around Hansen Dam and back.
</P>
<P>
   You saw him on the way back, around 6 a.m. at Glenoaks Boulevard
and Pierce Street, not far from his home.
</P>
<P>
   We know because that's where police found his body crumpled in
the gutter, dead from gunshot wounds. Neighbors say it was around 6
a.m. when they heard the shots.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Guerra, a licensed vocational nurse, says she heard about
Julio at work late Monday. Her knees went weak, and she had to sit
down or she would have hit the floor. She just sat there and cried
for 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   For the last year, Julio's been her helper on Station 2 over at
the Foothill Health and Rehabilitation Center in Sylmar. It's a
mental health facility. She and Julio would spend their shift
together trying to help the people on Station 2 make some sense of
this crazy world.
</P>
<P>
   After pulling eight hours there, Julio went over to the Beverly
Manor Convalescent Hospital in Panorama City for another eight as a
nurse's aide, helping old people live out their lives in some
dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Guerra called Julio an ``angel from Earth.'' Never complained,
always taking on extra duties, always ready to switch work days to
help a co-worker out of a jam.
</P>
<P>
   All the patients loved him.
</P>
<P>
   That's why they and the staff chipped in what they could the
other day when Julio's father, Julio Sr., stopped by to say thanks
and pick up an envelope with some cash in it.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't much, Guerra said, but it helped the financially
strapped Cano family bury its main breadwinner the other day at
Forest Lawn, Hollywood Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Angelic &UR;  &LR; Flores, Julio's older sister, had her mother,
Eustaquia, by the arm _ helping her get through the service and
burial.
</P>
<P>
   Your bullets hit her, too.
</P>
<P>
   Right in the heart. Maybe of all the Canos, she's taking Julio's
death the hardest.
</P>
<P>
   He was her baby, her salvation. Angelic says Julio and his
mother would sit for hours talking about the future _ about how he
was going to school to become a nurse just like Susan Guerra.
</P>
<P>
   How someday he would make enough money to hire his mother a maid
so she would never have to scrub another toilet or floor with those
painful, arthritic hands.
</P>
<P>
   How he promised her he would do everything in his power to move
his family to a safe place, away from these violent, gang-ridden
Pacoima projects.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Police Department Detective Lindy Gligorijevic, who
is handling this homicide, says that in the last nine months in the
Canos' apartment complex there have been three gang-related
killings.
</P>
<P>
   Julio, she says, was a good kid just in the wrong place at the
wrong time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, he and his family live in a housing project
that has a rival gang problem, and it looks like in the early
morning hours, while out running, Julio may have been mistaken for
somebody in a rival gang,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or, it may be that it was just somebody out hunting.''
</P>
<P>
   Somebody out hunting.
</P>
<P>
   For a human being.
</P>
<P>
   Any human being.
</P>
<P>
   Crazy.

BANSHEE BREEZE IS IMPRESSIVE IN BEATING MANISTIQUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH DURSO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ Jersey Girl may be the leader pro tem
for the championship among 3-year-old fillies; she had seven
straight victories before undergoing knee surgery that might keep
her from racing the rest of the year. But a powerful rival tossed
her hat into the ring Saturday when Banshee Breeze won the Alabama
Stakes by six lengths over Lu Ravi, one month after winning the
Coaching Club American Oaks, and inflicted defeat for the first
time on Manistique, the wonder horse from California.
</P>
<P>
   Both Banshee Breeze and Manistique are daughters of Unbridled,
winner of the 1990 Kentucky Derby and Breeders' Cup Classic. But
Banshee Breeze, racing for the ninth time, won for the fifth time
and showed that experience often prevails over sheer brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   Manistique, a huge filly named for a town in Wisconsin, was
racing for only the fourth time. And, although she had won each of
her three starts at Hollywood Park by at least 10 lengths, she
apparently had breathing problems and could not cope.
</P>
<P>
   Banshee Breeze has won at a mile and a half in the Coaching Club
American Oaks and at a mile and a quarter in the Alabama, the filly
counterpart to next Saturday's Travers Stakes. Even her jockey,
Jerry Bailey, was impressed with the way she handled Manistique,
the betting choice, ridden by Gary Stevens, who flew here from the
West Coast for the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of horse at every point in the race,'' Bailey
said, ``and I couldn't believe how she was running. I was right
behind the favorite. and I wasn't sure how much horse Gary had, but
I knew that he would need a lot because my filly was ready to run.
This was the best that she finished, and past the wire she still
had more in her. To have her this ready was just incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   The man who got her ready was Carl Nafzger, who also trained
Unbridled, and he said before the race, ``Despite the competition,
Banshee Breeze is going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Banshee Breeze not only won with a roar down the homestretch but
was widening her margin at the finish, with Lu Ravi getting second
place by a neck with a furious dash that passed Manistique near the
wire. The official report on the race said that Manistique, who had
not run farther than a mile and an eighth, had ``nothing left for
the drive.''
</P>
<P>
   After the race, Nafzger saluted Banshee Breeze in these words:
``She's learned to finish her races. She has run stellar races in
each of her last two starts. She ran second in the Kentucky Oaks
and third in the Mother Goose, she learned a lot, she is more
focused and she's run anywhere from seven-eighths to a mile and a
half.''
</P>
<P>
   As for her route to a possible championship, Nafzger said:
``We'll give her a rest, then let her run against older fillies and
mares in the Spinster at Keeneland in October and then the
Breeders' Cup Distaff in November. To earn a championship, you have
to go two turns, finish up the year and run against older ones. If
she handles that, I think she'd have done enough to earn it. That
is, if she keeps beating everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   John Shireffs, who trains Manistique, reported that his filly
had encountered trouble breathing, and said: ``It's disappointing
to come all the way here from California to finish third. Gary told
me she displaced, or swallowed, her tongue. She's a good filly, and
has all the tools to be the best.''
</P>
<P>
   The winner ran the mile and a half in 2:03 1/5, paid $6.70 for a
$2 bet to win and went home with $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   FINISH LINES
</P>
<P>
   It looks like a field of six or seven for next Saturday's
Travers Stakes: Coronado's Quest, Victory Gallop, Grand Slam,
Deputy Diamond, Dice Dancer, Raffie's Majesty and, on the fence,
Archers Bay, Thomas Jo and Tomorrow's Cat. The Horse of the Year in
1997, Favorite Trick, will not be there because his handlers do not
want him to run a mile and a quarter. But Deputy Diamond, who ran
second to him in the Jim Dandy, worked five furlongs Saturday
morning in 59 1/5 seconds on Saratoga's main track. His trainer,
SCOTTY SCHULHOFER, said, ``I wanted him to go one minute, but he
went faster and that's okay with me.''

COUPLE ACCUSED OF STARVING DAUGHTER TO DEATH RELIES ON FAITH

<P>
   LAKE LOS ANGELES, Calif. _ The crime is unspeakable: a father
and mother starving their severely disabled daughter to death.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Michael and Kathleen ``Katrina'' Gentry stand accused of
just that, of killing 15-year-old Lindsay, an offense so heinous
they are being held in Los Angeles County jails on $1 &UR;  &LR; million bail
each.
</P>
<P>
   To their friends and neighbors in this remote high-desert
community, the idea that the Gentrys _ churchgoing, civic-minded,
generous and devoted _ could do such a thing is unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We _ the people who know the truth _ know these people could
never be responsible for any of this,'' said Paul Villandry, a
longtime friend. ``These people give their lives to helping
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Villandry and about 40 others have rallied behind the Gentrys.
They have set up an Internet site, staged a fund-raiser at a
Lancaster JetHawks minor-league baseball game and are selling
T-shirts bearing the Gentrys' likenesses to raise money for their
legal defense. They also wrote testimonials in an effort to
convince a judge to lower the couple's bail.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the supporters also may be at the Gentrys' preliminary
hearing, scheduled for Wednesday in Los Angeles Municipal Court.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Gentry, 44, is being held in the women's section of the
Twin Towers Correctional Facility. She receives medication for pain
caused by a lifelong medical condition, but is otherwise treated as
an ordinary prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gentry _ a former Town Council and Park Association
member, volunteer firefighter and longtime Air Force reservist _ is
locked up in an isolation cell in Men's Central Jail in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview in jail, he spoke of his faith in God and
belief that his and his wife's innocence will protect them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never done anything wrong, so why should I be afraid?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not an angel,'' he said, ``but with respect to my
children, I have tried to give my them the best, physically and
mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   The second of Michael and Kathleen Gentry's two daughters _ he
has two grown children from a previous marriage _ Lindsay was 10
weeks premature when she was born Jan. 4, 1981. She had water on
the brain, dislocated hips and clubbed feet.
</P>
<P>
   She also suffered from congenital myotonic dystrophy, which is
characterized by the wasting of muscles, the formation of
cataracts, premature baldness and, frequently, mental deficiency.
She inherited the condition from her mother, who has a mild form of
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives said that the Gentrys tried to give Lindsay a normal
and happy childhood, although the little girl was frequently
hospitalized and always in pain.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gentry built a playground, swimming pool and spa in the
backyard. Kathleen Gentry gave Lindsay massages to alleviate some
of her pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to make her as comfortable as we could,'' said Helen
Darrow, Michael Gentry's mother, who lived with the family during
the two years before Lindsay's death.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay's parents also enrolled her in special education classes
in the Wilsona School District, where the girl was teased by other
youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would take her walking stick and make her fall,'' said
Licecka Brown, Lindsay's classmate at Wilsona Elementary School.
``They called her slow and retarded and barked in her ear.''
</P>
<P>
   Six months before she died, the Gentrys withdrew Lindsay from
school, choosing to teach her at home. Her condition worsened
around Thanksgiving 1995, and she was admitted in January 1996 to
Kaiser Foundation Hospital in Fontana.
</P>
<P>
   When she died Feb. 6, the 4-foot-8-inch girl weighed less than
50 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay's death certificate listed pneumonia and marasmus _
progressive emaciation caused by a lack of food _ as contributing
factors. Because of her complex health problems, authorities didn't
suspect wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Then, detectives received a tip from someone close to the family
that Lindsay had been mistreated. They opened an investigation that
spanned two years and included numerous medical specialists before
deciding to arrest the Gentrys.
</P>
<P>
   Homicide detectives and prosecutors declined to comment for this
story, although they previously have said they believe Lindsay
could have survived given proper care and treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In jail, Michael Gentry is labeled a ``high-power inmate'' _ he
is an accused child killer and has an excessively high bail _ so is
isolated from other inmates.
</P>
<P>
   He is allowed out of his 6-by-9-foot cell for 30 minutes every
other day to shower, shave and use the phone. One day a week, he
gets to spend three hours in a 10-by-10-foot room equipped with
weightlifting gear.
</P>
<P>
   While other inmates are allowed four visits a week, Michael
Gentry may have visitors for 20 minutes on Fridays and Sundays. He
is separated from his visitors by a thick glass window and must use
a phone to communicate.
</P>
<P>
   Clean shaven, calm and mild-mannered, Gentry says he doesn't
mind being in prison but is concerned about his wife because of her
medical condition. He offered to stay in jail as security if his
wife is released.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about my wife,'' he said. ``I'll be the insurance for
my wife's freedom.''

belief that his and his wife's innocence will protect them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never done anything wrong, so why should I be afraid?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not an angel,'' he said, ``but with respect to my
children, I have tried to give my them the best, physically and
mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   The second of Michael and Kathleen Gentry's two daughters _ he
has two grown children from a previous marriage _ Lindsay was 10
weeks premature when she was born Jan. 4, 1981. She had water on
the brain, dislocated hips and clubbed feet.
</P>
<P>
   She also suffered from congenital myotonic dystrophy, which is
characterized by the wasting of muscles, the formation of
cataracts, premature baldness and, frequently, mental deficiency.
She inherited the condition from her mother, who has a mild form of
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives said that the Gentrys tried to give Lindsay a normal
and happy childhood, although the little girl was frequently
hospitalized and always in pain.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gentry built a playground, swimming pool and spa in the
backyard. Kathleen Gentry gave Lindsay massages to alleviate some
of her pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to make her as comfortable as we could,'' said Helen
Darrow, Michael Gentry's mother, who lived with the family during
the two years before Lindsay's death.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay's parents also enrolled her in special education classes
in the Wilsona School District, where the girl was teased by other
youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would take her walking stick and make her fall,'' said
Licecka Brown, Lindsay's classmate at Wilsona Elementary School.
``They called her slow and retarded and barked in her ear.''
</P>
<P>
   Six months before she died, the Gentrys withdrew Lindsay from
school, choosing to teach her at home. Her condition worsened
around Thanksgiving 1995, and she was admitted in January 1996 to
Kaiser Foundation Hospital in Fontana.
</P>
<P>
   When she died Feb. 6, the 4-foot-8-inch girl weighed less than
50 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay's death certificate listed pneumonia and marasmus _
progressive emaciation caused by a lack of food _ as contributing
factors. Because of her complex health problems, authorities didn't
suspect wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Then, detectives received a tip from someone close to the family
that Lindsay had been mistreated. They opened an investigation that
spanned two years and included numerous medical specialists before
deciding to arrest the Gentrys.
</P>
<P>
   Homicide detectives and prosecutors declined to comment for this
story, although they previously have said they believe Lindsay
could have survived given proper care and treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In jail, Michael Gentry is labeled a ``high-power inmate'' _ he
is an accused child killer and has an excessively high bail _ so is
isolated from other inmates.
</P>
<P>
   He is allowed out of his 6-by-9-foot cell for 30 minutes every
other day to shower, shave and use the phone. One day a week, he
gets to spend three hours in a 10-by-10-foot room equipped with
weightlifting gear.
</P>
<P>
   While other inmates are allowed four visits a week, Michael
Gentry may have visitors for 20 minutes on Fridays and Sundays. He
is separated from his visitors by a thick glass window and must use
a phone to communicate.
</P>
<P>
   Clean shaven, calm and mild-mannered, Gentry says he doesn't
mind being in prison but is concerned about his wife because of her
medical condition. He offered to stay in jail as security if his
wife is released.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about my wife,'' he said. ``I'll be the insurance for
my wife's freedom.''

FROSH STARS POISED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One prepared for the season by running desert hills under the
watchful eye of his older brother. The other followed UCLA's
training program and consulting his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Different paths, same destination.
</P>
<P>
   Just five practices into their freshman season, tailback DeShaun
Foster and linebacker Robert Thomas have emerged as impact players
_ perhaps the most impressive members of UCLA's top-rated
recruiting class. Both are expected to contribute immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Foster) is more nifty than we thought,'' offensive
coordinator Al Borges said. ``We knew he was powerful, but he has
better stop-and-go ability than we thought. He's got a chance to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster, from Tustin, will push Jermaine Lewis and Keith Brown
for the starting job, in part because he spent the summer running
sprints and lifting weights (at UCLA's behest) and is physically
prepared for college competition.
</P>
<P>
   His challenge is learning the offense, especially recognizing
audibles and pass-protection schemes. For advice, Foster turned to
former Tustin teammates and current UCLA linemen David Wilford and
Steve Sua.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me to make sure I picked up the plays and then go
from there,'' Foster said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas spent several weeks with his older brother, Stan, a
former NFL lineman, running hills near the desert town of Banning.
But for all Thomas' athletic gifts _ he's remarkably fast for a
225-pound inside linebacker _ position coach Marc Dove is most
impressed with his intellect and maturity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're never sure how freshmen will adjust, especially coming
from a small school like (San Diego) Imperial,'' said Dove, who
recruited Thomas. ``But he seems to have the right maturity to give
himself a chance to be an impact player.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see the talent on the field, but until you get them in
a college environment, you don't know how they'll react. Robert's a
quick learner. Stan helped a lot in terms of his preparation.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record: Foster set the record straight on the impact of
Sherman Oaks Notre Dame tailback Justin Fargas on his recruitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Fargas) had decided to go to UCLA, then we both would have
been here,'' Foster said. ``I was coming no matter what. I liked it
that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Fargas chose Michigan over USC and UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Roster update: Defensive end Jayson Brown, who missed two
seasons with knee injuries, was granted a rare sixth year of
eligibility by the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have several walk-ons. At least one, long snapper
Jeff Grau, from Loyola High, is expected to contribute.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: Right guard Andy Meyers (knee), left guard Oscar
Cabrera (back), tight end Gabe Crecion (back) and defensive lineman
Pete Holland (back) will participate in the afternoon sessions only
during double-days.
</P>
<P>
   They are expected to play Sept. 12 against Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Happy Holiday: UCLA athletic director Peter Dalis supports the
league's tentative agreement to send its second-place team to the
Holiday Bowl in San Diego, probably against the No. 3 team from the
Big 12.
</P>
<P>
   The move eliminates the Cotton Bowl from the Pacific-10's
postseason picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great move,'' Dalis said. ``San Diego is a great
destination point for the fans. It has ideal weather, and it's more
cost efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cotton pays slightly more than the Holiday _ this year the
difference is approximately $200,000 _ but Pac-10 officials believe
the change makes financial sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you consider the difference in travel (expenses), then it
will be at least equal to the Cotton Bowl,'' Pac-10 assistant
commissioner Jim Muldoon said. ``And theoretically, teams will sell
more tickets, which will help their bottom line.''

SPORTS COLUMN: AL CAMPANIS _ A GOOD MAN WHO HAD A BAD MOMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A friend of mine died two months ago while I was in the middle
of the World Cup, and then came vacation. Now, before I get going
on the next season, I need to write about a good man named Al
Campanis.
</P>
<P>
   The Chief is a stick figure now, a stereotype, useful to anybody
with a knee-jerk desire to flail a symbol of the white American
sports establishment. He put himself in this vulnerable position on
April 6, 1987, when he bumbled and mumbled on national television
about why there were not more African-American baseball managers
and executives.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had he uttered the word ``necessities'' than his
career as general manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers was over, with
the formality of a resignation two days later.
</P>
<P>
   I have heard Don Newcombe use the word ``tragedy'' to describe
what happened to Al Campanis. Newk was one of the first blacks in
the major leagues, and he has served the Dodgers long and well in
community liaison and addiction treatment, and he does not mince
words. He knows Al Campanis was not from central casting of elderly
white power brokers who consciously barred the door to black (and
Hispanic) candidates.
</P>
<P>
   How many times, in private chats, did I hear Al rave about his
Montreal Royals teammate Jackie Robinson as one of the greatest
baseball people he had known, or lament the early paralysis of Roy
Campanella and the early death of Jim Gilliam that kept them from
managing for the Dodgers or some other team? Of course they would
have made great managers, Al said. They were Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The Campanis ``tragedy'' concerns all of us _ fans, journalists
and athletes _ because it refers to the way we attach labels to
people and events. I am not talking about the current sordid
business in which the world is re-evaluating a U.S. president for
his lifetime pattern of evasion.
</P>
<P>
   I am talking about the American need for new scapegoats, new
villains, every day. I am talking about one foolish moment, one
addled statement on live television, and how your snippet of film
clip, your press clippings, the guffaws from the talk shows, will
follow you to the end of your days.
</P>
<P>
   Al Campanis, born on a Greek island in the middle of World War
I, never caught up with the electronic sound-bite age. He was a
perfect example of why most of us should be cautious about
appearing on live radio or television. In normal dugout or
press-room conversation, Al tended to meander down obscure
conversational paths, until one of the reporters would raise an
eyebrow and murmur, ``Ummm, Chief,'' and steer him back onto the
main highway.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody I know ever heard him utter a solitary phrase that could
have been vaguely construed as racist. When I got to know him in
the early 1980s, he would come to New York's Shea Stadium and fill
the general manager's box next to the visiting dugout with scouts
and officials and old high school coaches, many of them of color,
many of them from the Dominican Republic, where the Dodgers did
business. With his dark suits and courtly manners, he was quite at
home with these Caribbean gentlemen.
</P>
<P>
   In my opinion, Al Campanis was incapable of prejudice because he
had faced marginalism in his own life. He was born on Kos, in the
Greek chain called the Dodecanese, across the straits from Turkey.
His mother had fallen in love with a dashing Italian bersagliero, a
marksman soldier, and she pursued him by ship to his home city of
Modena, convincing his family that she wanted nothing more than a
legal name for her son.
</P>
<P>
   Struck by her bearing, they signed the papers that named the boy
Alessandro Campani. Later, a U.S. immigration official added an
``s'' to the boy's last name.
</P>
<P>
   Al Campanis attended New York's George Washington High, and then
he acquired a New York University degree that was always apparent.
</P>
<P>
   His humanity and his education did not protect him on the night
of April 6, 1987. The officials of ``Nightline'' were looking for
people to comment on the 40th anniversary of Jackie Robinson's
major league debut, and they caught up to Robinson's loyal teammate
at a ball park and stuck a microphone on his lapel and a tiny
speaker in his ear, and connected him to the disembodied voice of
Ted Koppel, a few thousand miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Koppel asked: Was baseball prejudiced?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't believe it's prejudice,'' Campanis said. ``I truly
believe that they may not have some of the necessities to be, let's
say, a field manager or perhaps a general manager.''
</P>
<P>
   Koppel, who did not know Campanis, tried to help out his
bumbling guest, but lacking eye contact or body language or a brief
huddle in a studio, all Koppel could do was use words and
inflections, giving him an opportunity to ``dig yourself out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chief rambled on about blacks being good athletes but bad
swimmers and how there are few black quarterbacks in football. In
any slower-paced interview with a print journalist, Campanis would
have veered toward Robinson and Campanella and Gilliam, and the
inevitability of more minority officials.
</P>
<P>
   It is true, the Dodgers had not done enough to keep their best
people _ John Roseboro always comes to mind _ but Al had often
predicted that things would get better. This time, after a few
silly minutes on national television, he was a dead man,
professionally.
</P>
<P>
   He lived for another 11 years, a family man who loved his
mother, Mamma Tulla, like no man I have ever met, who mourned his
late wife, Bess, who loved his sons, George and Jimmy (whom he once
traded to Kansas City). On the day he resigned from the Dodgers, Al
called his grandson to see if he had got any hits that day for USC.
</P>
<P>
   None of this proves that Al Campanis did not have some blind
spot about the aptitude of blacks and Hispanics to teach and coach
and manage and scout. I only know that he was far more fair and
educated than he showed in his few dopey moments on television. I
hope everybody finds a new stick figure soon.

PROBE DELAYS NYC PLANS TO BUY GARBAGE TRUCKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla., N.Y.)   (bl)  
 By MIKE ALLEN   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The city has postponed plans to buy scores of garbage
trucks while it investigates its contracts with an Oklahoma company
that has supplied most of the current fleet. Arranging for a new
supplier could take more than a year, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Saturday, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said the
Department of Investigation was looking into the propriety of the
city's contracts with the company, Crane Carrier Co. of Tulsa,
Okla.
</P>
<P>
   Crane was the only bidder on many New York City contracts for
garbage trucks in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, tiny cracks were found in the steel frames of more than
20 trucks, then a few years old, made by Crane. Crane fixed the
cracks, but the city has stopped buying trucks from Crane until the
investigation is complete.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said investigators would look into the wisdom of
depending on one company to provide the majority of the city's
2,000 garbage trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always better if we don't have to do that,'' he said. ``I
don't know if that was a mistake in this case. When the Department
of Investigation finishes its investigation, I'll be able to tell
you whether that was a reasonable judgment in advance and it turned
out wrong, or it was not a reasonable judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   In a March letter to Crane, the Department of Citywide
Administrative Services, which buys city supplies, said the company
had been ruled ineligible to bid on a contract for new trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The letter said Crane had been ``determined not to be a
responsible vendor.'' It asserted that Crane had ``failed to
perform adequately on previously awarded contracts,'' ``provided
trucks which did not conform to the specifications in significant
respects,'' and manufactured trucks ``with poor internal testing
and quality controls.''
</P>
<P>
   James Wade, who was the company's vice president of sales when
the cracks were discovered, said Crane had thought that the
Department of Sanitation was ``completely satisfied.'' He said New
York was by far the company's largest customer, and municipal
contracts were an important part of its business.
</P>
<P>
   ``To avoid any possibility of a future problem, the company at
its own cost went through and repaired all of the frames that were
suspicious, and reinforced all the other trucks that were in that
whole series,'' said Wade, who retired in April.
</P>
<P>
   Crane president Reg Wallace did not respond to a message left at
his home Saturday. A security guard at Crane said no spokesman was
available, and said he was not allowed to take messages.
</P>
<P>
   Crane Carrier's Web site says the company was founded in 1953
and specializes in heavy-duty custom vehicles, including
waste-collection trucks, cement mixers and airport ground-support
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The company supplied all but 53 of the 1,987 garbage trucks in
the Department of Sanitation's fleet, and all but 16 of the
department's 121 front-end loaders, a city spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said officials were not concerned that any defect in
the trucks might hamper service. ``The vast majority of trucks
aren't affected by this, so there isn't a broad-based concern about
the safety of trucks or the viability of trucks,'' he said.

REVOLUTION DECIMATED BY GALAXY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ The Revolution could have used Walter Zenga on the
field instead of as an honored guest during Saturday's game against
the Los Angeles Galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   But even Zenga would have struggled against the Galaxy, which
controlled the game from the opening kickoff, in taking a 5-1
victory to keep the Revolution in last place.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy, owners of the best record in Major League Soccer
with 58 points in 26 matches, should have been expected to defeat
the Revolution, who have the league's worst mark with 20 points.
But the margin of the rout indicates the Revolution have lost their
way and have little hope of qualifying for the playoffs, though
they could salvage hope at Miami Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution played conservatively at the start, creating few
scoring chances, even after surrendering an 11th-minute headed goal
to Cobi Jones. They rallied beginning the second half, but soon
after Carlos Hermosillo headed in a Martin Machon cross 11 minutes
into the half, the Revolution collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Jones scored three goals but missed a 70th-minute penalty kick,
after which Revolution captain Mike Burns was ejected. And
Hermosillo scored twice, the second just seconds after the penalty
kick.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the Revolution to keep the score close before a
crowd of 24,143 raised questions about coach Thomas Rongen, who was
asked if he would resign after the match. ``Absolutely not,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't evade responsibility for the dismal showing. ``It
starts at the top, and I take responsibility,'' said the coach.
``If you look at the team, I'm not satisfied with the team's and my
own performance. I feel the Kraft family, the fans, and the
organization deserve a better team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've proven in the past that I can put a winning product on
the field. I'm disappointed in my own performance, but that doesn't
necessarily lead to my resignation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution's central defense again faltered; the team has
allowed a league-worst 60 goals. The opening goal was headed in by
Jones, at 5 feet 5 inches among the shortest players on the field,
who was free because of miscommunication between the Revolution
central defenders and 6-6 goalkeeper Ian Feuer.
</P>
<P>
   Rongen hoped to play compactly, to parry the Galaxy's attacks,
then take the offensive in the second half. But the Revolution
virtually surrendered the midfield and were outflanked by the speed
of Jones and Welton.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution rallied late, sparked by 18-year-old Jamar
Beasley, who drew a penalty from Paul Caligiuri on his first touch.
Raul Diaz Arce hit the top of the crossbar with the penalty in the
76th minute, then headed in a Beasley cross with the Revolution
trailing, 5-0, in the 89th minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against a team as good as LA, you can't play catchup,'' Rongen
said. ``It's that simple. The game was won and lost in the first
half with that goal. We knew we couldn't play come-from-behind. At
halftime we were still in the game, but after the second goal, that
was all she wrote.''
</P>
<P>
   Hermosillo, among the most powerful strikers in Mexico before
joining the Galaxy this season, leaped over Manny Motajo for the
second goal. But the play was set up by a counterattack, with Jones
penetrating into the heart of the Revolution defense, then laying
off to Machon, who drew out Feuer and crossed to the far post.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question they are disappointed in themselves,''
Rongen said of his team. ``We are in this together. We all make
mistakes. Collectively, we are not doing the job we are supposed to
do. As a team, we played poorly defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution's best chance to recover was at the outset of the
second half, when David Nakhid moved into attacking positions.
Then, Joe-Max Moore headed wide in the eighth minute. The Galaxy
countered seconds later for Hermosillo's first goal and a 2-0 edge.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Revolution began gambling and left themselves
embarrassingly exposed on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there are any easy games when there are 12 teams
still with a chance to achieve something,'' Galaxy coach Octavio
Zambrano said. ``Technically, nobody is out of it. We played like
we know how to, kicked the ball around, and waited for an
opportunity.''

JONES IS GALAXY'S MVP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ Can there be any doubt that Los Angeles Galaxy
midfielder Cobi Jones is this season's Most Valuable Player of
Major League Soccer?
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's 5-1 victory over the Revolution, Jones punched in
three goals and had an assist, for his third hat trick of the
season and the fourth in his career. It gave Jones 16 goals and 10
assists for the 20-6 Galaxy, tying him for the team and league lead
in points with Welton, formerly of the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   By reaching double figures in both goals and assists, Jones
joined only five players in the league to do so this season. He
leads the league in hat tricks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy about it,'' said Jones. ``I've got to look at
that as a positive, but I have to study the negatives. I think,
personally, I should have had two more in this game. I've got to
look at that and try to better myself. I'm very happy with what I
have, but I've got to study a bit and to think about the
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy are 17-0 in the last 17 games in which Jones has
scored. He's played in only 18 games this season.
</P>
<P>
   In seven career games against the Revolution, Jones has five
goals and two assists.
</P>
<P>
   His first goal Saturday came in the 11th minute when he had a
header at the top of the box, getting to the ball quicker than
Revolution defender Manny Motajo and crossing up goalkeeper Ian
Feuer.
</P>
<P>
   His two others were on breakaways, in the 79th minute and the
85th minute, both on touches.
</P>
<P>
   As for the misses, Jones failed on a penalty kick in the 78th
minute, trying to tuck the ball into the upper-right corner. ``I
hit it and I thought for sure it was going in, but (Feuer) has got
a wing span like no tomorrow,'' Jones said. ``He got it and knocked
it against the post.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other miss, Jones took a pass from Clint Mathis and shot,
but the ball never reached the goal. ``At the time I thought I
should shoot it,'' Jones said, ``but when (Feuer) came out and I
shot it and it went through his legs. It bounced and through his
legs, but one of their guys cleared it out. Hindsight is 100
percent, but I probably should have dribbled around (Feuer).''
</P>
<P>
   Said Galaxy coach Octavio Zambrano, ``That's the challenge that
he puts on himself. It's always about playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones isn't spending his time thinking about being the league's
MVP. ``Personally, I'm just going out and trying to do what I have
to do,'' he said. ``I'm supposed to be one of the scorers and
people give me the ball so I'm just doing my job out there. The
rest of the guys are helping me out and getting me to where I am
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Zambrano, ``His overall competitiveness is what makes him
the player that he is. He takes it personally to perform at 100
percent in every match. I've never seen Cobi go through a match
without giving it his all. And he exposes his body when he does
that. He doesn't back off. At 28 years old, you peak in the game
and Jones still is. He's definitely one of the strongest candidates
to be the MVP.''

YANKS' PITCHER HEARTENED BY LETTER FROM DAUGHTER IN CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Orlando Hernandez, the defector from Cuba who
will make his 15th start for the New York Yankees here Sunday
against the Texas Rangers, has been heartened by a letter he
received from his eldest daughter. With a broad smile, the pitcher
said Yahumara Hernandez, 8, wrote in a letter received three days
ago that she understands why her father left Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Yahumara and her sister Steffi, 3, remained in Cuba with
Hernandez's former wife, while their father left Cuba for
liberation and an opportunity to pursue his baseball career. The
letter, Hernandez said through an interpreter, ``took away some
worry.'' He added, ``You always worry that when kids grow up, they
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Yahumara also included a catalog of Barbie dolls, with the
request that Hernandez send one of each that she checked off. ``She
checked off all but two,'' Hernandez said, laughing. ``She's very
smart.''

CAN HACKETT HACK IT?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Talk to Paul Hackett's friends, and you will hear
tales about a perfectionist with a burning intensity to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Talk to Hackett, and you'll get a couple more personality traits
rarely heard about.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is the one you haven't added was impatience,''
Hackett said. ``I had a bull-in-a-china-shop attitude. That gets
you into trouble, particularly with authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ambition was always one issue. I was seen as a guy who doesn't
have a lot of tolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett described himself as ``a guy going 1,000 miles per hour,
regardless of what's in his way,'' during his younger years.
</P>
<P>
   But Hackett the coach, like Hackett the person, has undergone
changes. The ambition and intolerance are no longer issues, Hackett
said. He's 51 years old and doing things differently than his
previous college and NFL stops.
</P>
<P>
   Now, back at USC, Hackett is trying to make the most of perhaps
his last chance to prove he can be a successful head coach, with a
kinder, gentler approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm older and wiser,'' Hackett said. ``You can't keep making
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest occurred in Berkeley in 1975, when Hackett
was an assistant at California. He coached outstanding quarterbacks
Steve Bartkowski and Joe Roth and began building his reputation as
a quarterback guru. However, Hackett got fined and reprimanded by
Cal athletic director Dave Maggard for violating NCAA rules.
</P>
<P>
   The school's faculty athletic representative, the late Bob
Steidel, wanted to fire Hackett. It's an episode few know about,
but Hackett looks back at it with amusement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never liked me (at Cal),'' Hackett said. ``I was too
ambitious.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett was found to have violated the rules by working with his
quarterbacks during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overzealous,'' he said. ``One of the days I was on the
sideline yelling at the quarterbacks . . . my typical attitude. I
was right next to (Maggard's office).
</P>
<P>
   ``He decided to make an example of it. I reacted to him and got
upset. Dave Maggard and I never saw eye to eye on anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Maggard, who now lives in Atlanta: ``There were NCAA and
Pac-10 Conference rules violations and we took care of them. Paul
was very ambitious and temperamental.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Cal coach Mike White, who is an assistant with the St.
Louis Rams, said Hackett would have eventually been the head coach
at Cal if not for clashes between the football staff and
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, Paul was trying to do one thing, help build the
image of Cal football,'' White said. ``To be questioned for his
integrity, I could see how that could stick in his craw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he got reprimanded for taking a player to lunch. He was
trying to build a rapport. Maybe somebody said he saw Paul and a
player throwing a ball from a window. Paul's motive was never more
than to help a student do a better job.''
</P>
<P>
   White and Hackett and other Cal assistants probably dodged
another bullet when NCAA violations were discovered regarding the
eligibility of running back Chuck Muncie during their tenure. By
the time the violations were unearthed in 1980, however, the NCAA's
four-year statute of limitations had lapsed and no one was
punished.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he wasn't worried that being disciplined at Cal
would derail his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knew I was a good football coach,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he proved it at USC, where as the offensive coordinator he
helped lead the Trojans to a national championship in 1978.
Although his initial tenure as a USC assistant under John Robinson
is frequently portrayed as a warm, fuzzy ``mentor-prodigy''
relationship, those who worked at USC in the late '70s remember a
far different atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett's pass-first mentality often clashed against Robinson's
power-running philosophy, and arguments stretched from Heritage
Hall to the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be going to the game and have a battle,'' Hackett
said. ``We were always going at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Things became so heated, some former assistants thought Hackett
might quit during several games.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times, I was more aggressive than I should have been,''
Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett eventually got fed up at USC, but it wasn't his
relationship with Robinson that caused him to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time I (thought about quitting) was when it got to be
that winning wasn't enough, and that happened in the fourth year,''
Hackett said. ``We would win and be coming up the tunnel and people
would be upset because we didn't win by enough points.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be nine more years before Hackett got his first chance
to be a head coach, when Pitt hired him to replace Mike Gottfried,
who was 26-17-2 in four seasons. It turned out to be an emotionally
scarring experience as Hackett tried to win and build the academic
program simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked him to get rid of all the questionable-character
kids,'' said Kansas State assistant coach Ron Hudson, who grew up
with Hackett in the Bay Area and remains a close friend. ``He told
the kids you had to go to class.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett's record at Pitt was 13-20-1, and he was fired after
three seasons, but he still feels bitter that the school's
president and athletic director left shortly after he was hired.
</P>
<P>
   ``My support group got knocked out from under me,'' Hackett
said.
</P>
<P>
   His experience at Pitt has probably had the most profound impact
on Hackett's approach to coaching at USC. He has delegated
authority to his assistant coaches and _ unlike at Pitt _ is not
trying to coach the quarterbacks, run the offense and be the head
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, I had to do it all. I had to do it all and it
almost killed me,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett loves to tutor the USC quarterbacks during training camp
at UC Irvine, but he has not been overbearing or obsessed with
running the offense, a main critique from his time at Pitt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very serious but in a good way,'' quarterback Mike Van
Raaphorst said. ``He has a lot that he can teach us.''
</P>
<P>
   He has also been extremely patient with the players.
</P>
<P>
   White said Rams quarterback Steve Bono recently messed up a
drill during practice, so he asked Bono how Hackett would have
reacted when the pair worked in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would have thrown a fit,'' Bono told White.
</P>
<P>
   There's been little of that so far at USC. At practices, it's
far more likely to hear him encourage a quarterback. ``Great pass,
Carson'' has not been an unlikely comment while observing freshman
quarterback Carson Palmer. Hackett has earned the respect of
players, notably by suspending temperamental wide receiver R. Jay
Soward for the season-opener for poor academic performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He treats us all equally,'' wide receiver Billy Miller. ``He
said he doesn't want stars, he wants a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett has learned to make the subtle changes for a chance to
succeed at USC. He wants to bring USC back to prominence, but this
is also Hackett's chance to prove that the brilliant assistant can
finally make it as a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   He is confident in his methods but isn't as likely to lose his
temper. His intensity remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to learn from every experience,'' Hackett said.
``When you get your (butt) beat, which we did at Kansas City, you
rethink it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett certainly has a game plan. He has already overhauled
USC's football office. Sixteen employees connected to the football
program have either left, been reassigned or fired since January.
</P>
<P>
   It's Hackett's operation now, win or lose. And he's willing to
take responsibility, if he gets a chance to rebuild the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a process of trying to build a great tradition at
this university,'' he said. ``It's going to take time. It's a
long-term process.''

COACHES WORK ON PLAN FOR PURDUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC football coach Paul Hackett gave the Trojans
the day off, but Saturday was just another work day for his staff.
Hackett began putting together a game plan for next Sunday's game
against Purdue at the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no day off for coaches,'' Hackett said. ``There's
always one more tape to look at.''
</P>
<P>
   Since it's the season-opener, USC's impression of Purdue will be
largely based on last year's game tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're assuming they'll be somewhat similar,'' Hackett said.
``All we have to go on is last year. About all they know about us
is we'll line up in the `I' (formation).''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett will be bucking history when he tries to win the
season-opener. Six straight USC coaches have failed to win in their
debut games, including John Robinson twice (1976, 1993). Ted
Tollner tied Florida 19-19 in his debut in 1983. The last USC coach
to win his first game was Jess Hill in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   Fast walk-on: USC sprinter Marcus Holiwell is trying to join the
team as a walk-on at wide receiver. Holiwell is one of the track
team's top sprinters.
</P>
<P>
   He will joined in the spring on track by fellow sprinters Sultan
McCullough and Miguel Fletcher.
</P>
<P>
   Walk-on wide receiver Dylan Weiss has left the team to
concentrate on academics.
</P>
<P>
   Will Palmer play? Hackett doesn't seem to be in hurry to get
freshman quarterback Carson Palmer into a game. Asked if Palmer
might see some action against Purdue, Hackett said, ``I don't know.
I'm not much of a rotate-quarterbacks kind of guy. Let's see what
Mike (Van Raaphorst) can do. (But) there's no question Carson's got
a great future.''
</P>
<P>
   Training costs: USC will spend about $50,000 extra by staying in
Irvine for three weeks. The primary cost was moving equipment from
Los Angeles to Irvine. USC moved its weights and created a weight
room adjacent to the practice field. Food and dormitory costs are
about the same as if the team had stayed at USC.
</P>
<P>
   New look: For the first time in at least 20 years, USC players
are wearing cardinal blazers for road trips. Players usually wore
warm-up suits when they traveled in the past.

REHAB STINT IS THREE INNINGS FOR VALDES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Right-hander Ismael Valdes made his first minor-league
rehabilitation start since injuring his left side July 27 but
lasted just three scoreless innings and 44 pitches in a game for
the the Dodgers' Single-A affiliate in Port St. Lucie, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The club was hoping he would throw at least 75 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes spent the night in Orlando and flew back this morning to
Los Angeles, where he will be examined by orthopedist Frank Jobe.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers figured Valdes would make one minor-league start and
be ready to pitch Thursday against the Montreal Expos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be a little hard to read those things from here,'' said
Dodgers manager Glenn Hoffman, the former field coordinator for the
Dodgers' minor-league operation. ``We probably won't know until
tomorrow how he came out of this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes recovered slowly after injuring his side in a game
against the Arizona Diamondbacks. He did not throw a ball for two
weeks, but he reported great improvement during the past 10 days.
He threw a simulated game in Pittsburgh and reported no discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   Still looking: The Dodgers' general manager search continues.
Cincinnati GM Jim Bowden and Atlanta assistant Dean Taylor have
both interviewed with club president Bob Graziano in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor returned to Atlanta on Friday and spoke with interim GM
Tom Lasorda on Saturday. ``I really hope he gets this chance,''
Braves GM John Schuerholz said. ``He has been with me for 18 years,
back to the days in Kansas City. I don't know of anyone with his
grasp of all facets of the game _ minor leagues, contracts,
scouting, everything. I don't want to lose him, but this is a great
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All I want to say about the interview is that it is an honor
to be considered for one of the most prestigious jobs in the
game,'' said Taylor, who started working for Schuerholz in 1980 at
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's Dave Dombrowski will be interviewed this week. Gary
Hughes, the Marlins' highly regarded director of player personnel,
also will speak to Graziano this week. Dombrowski and Hughes joined
the expansion Marlins in 1993 after several years together in
Montreal.

SIMPLY PUT, YANKEES REIGN SUPREME. PERIOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Yankees, go home.
</P>
<P>
   Don't come back until October.
</P>
<P>
   In the autumn, by the light of an always-dicey, best-of-five
postseason series, the New York Yankees might look a smidgen more
beatable.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, they are lapping the American League field. The
pundits are running out of adjectives. They are inviting
comparisons to some of the most formidable aggregations of all time
_ the '27 Yankees, the '75 Reds, the phone company before
deregulation, the Rolling Stones when Keith Richards had his
original factory color.
</P>
<P>
   This is embarrassing. New York has the league's best batting
average. The best earned-run average. The best caps. The best
muggers. The best $34.95 breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   If the Rangers come back and win the AL West with their current
percentage, the ``reward'' will be a first-round series against Joe
Torre's Yankees. It's a best-of-five series, but I like the New
Yorkers in two games. Then I figure the Yankees will beat the
Cleveland Indians in the ALCS by, oh, six or seven touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   There won't be any need to play the World Series because, by the
day postseason rosters are due, the Yankees will have bought up all
of the good players.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson _ left-handed setup man.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. _ late-inning defensive specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan _ shooting guard on off-season Yankee hoops team.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Springer _ coordinator of bench-clearing brawls.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are so good, they've almost become trite. New York
headline writers have had to hang on to every visiting team's
remark, in hopes of an original angle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canseco declares stadium dogs `tasty'
</P>
<P>
   Ripken misses early bus
</P>
<P>
   What kind of name is Nomar?''
</P>
<P>
   And last week's gem, ``Oates rips Yanks.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the story didn't exactly say that _ and though Rangers
manager Johnny Oates didn't, either _ the headline in the ``New
York Daily News'' suggested someone thought the emperor really had
no pinstriped clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could be further from the truth, of course. Oates didn't
say it. Oates doesn't even want to talk about it, as I learned by
innocently inquiring about ``this misquoting thing in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Duhh.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's dead!'' Oates abruptly answered, waving me away. ``I
have nothing whatsoever to say about it. It's a waste of time
trying to defend myself. Let's move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Earwitnesses support Oates' story. He didn't ``rip Yanks.''
</P>
<P>
   Why would he?
</P>
<P>
   Heading into last night, the Yankees were 61 games over .500,
which I think is the same record the Globetrotters have against the
Washington Generals. This time, however, we are all the straight
men in the Yankees' act. We think there's a pennant race going on.
</P>
<P>
   (Throw fake bucket of water on us here.)
</P>
<P>
   Against the Yankees this season, the Rangers are something like
2-and-89. They have lost to Yankees that speak three different
languages. They have lost, despite actually, truthfully, kind of,
more or less, playing the Yankees tough.
</P>
<P>
   Before last night, Oates didn't want to hear that, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until they add a column other than `wins' and `losses,' I
don't care about that,'' the manager said. ``Every paper I've ever
looked at doesn't have a column for `close games.'''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's not like the Rangers have been outclassed by the
Yankees. There was that memorable 15-13 New York victory at The
Ballpark back in early May. There was a 13-inning Rangers victory a
week later at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   When a foe is 61 games over .500, you have to be willing to read
between the lines.
</P>
<P>
   Oates, once burned in print, doesn't want to compare (yawn) the
New Yorkers with the greatest teams of all time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't there in 1906, so I don't know what kind of
competition the Cubs had,'' he said. ``And I wasn't there in 1927,
so I don't know what the Yankees' competition was like.''
</P>
<P>
   But these Yankees are pretty good. A Cadillac, perhaps, with a
Rolls Royce of a record.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend series at The Ballpark has done nothing to alter the
'98 Yanks' steamroller image. They are amazing. They are
relentless. They are re-lapping the field.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of name is Nomar, anyway?

THESE CHARACTERS EVOLVE POORLY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In ``A Tale of Two Cities,'' Sydney Carton
sacrifices his life so his friend Charles Darnay might live. You'd
probably have a dickens of a time explaining to today's generation
of professional athletes the motivation of a man who would sooner
go to the guillotine than see the lovely daughter of Dr. Alexander
Manette widowed.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the French Revolution, set Charles Dickens' morality tale
against the backdrop of the ongoing ``Me'' Revolution more than a
century later and what you have is ``A Tale of Three Athletes,''
featuring Artie Ulmer, Chris Webber and Allen Iverson.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 remake finds Ulmer, a reserve linebacker for the
Minnesota Vikings, acting on his love for Lucie Manette Darnay not
by spiriting her husband _ his friend _ out of prison and taking
his place but by slipping gamma hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) into her
ginger ale.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when she doth dare to protest, he backpedals faster than
the quarterbacks he chases for a living and scurries for cover
behind a friend. James Walter Kilpatrick was a passenger in Ulmer's
pickup truck the night in January he was pulled over by police in
Valdosta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   The police found GHB, commonly referred to as the ``date-rape''
drug or liquid ecstasy, in a bottle of cold medicine on the
console. A female friend of Ulmer recently testified before a grand
jury that the player gave her ginger ale laced with GHB to drink
outside a dance club the night before he was stopped and arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Ulmer, a second-year pro out of Valdosta State, was indicted
last month on three felony charges.
</P>
<P>
   He entered an innocent plea. Ulmer isn't disputing the existence
of the drug-laced medicine, just its owner. The bottle, he claims,
was Kilpatrick's, not his.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he is telling the truth, you feel like Ulmer is guilty
by association. Somewhere in the fine print of the social contract
among chums, doesn't it say friends don't let friends drive drunk
or drug women?
</P>
<P>
   But then you remember, this is the '90s. People today develop
Teflon characters early, the better to allow such things as blame
to bounce right off them. It's a moral sickness, with
responsibility passed on like the germs that cause the common cold.
</P>
<P>
   Chivalry? It's definitely as dead as Dickens. In another story
line in this remake, a carry-on bag containing, among other things,
11 grams of marijuana concealed in a sock is discovered in the
transit lounge of the San Juan, Puerto Rico airport. A couple of
modern-day aristocrats _ you know them as NBA players _ are sitting
there with their entourage awaiting a flight to Barbados.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. custom officials initially identified the bag, which was
recovered last week, as belonging to Philadelphia guard Jerry
Stackhouse. He was questioned before Webber came forward and
claimed ownership, in a roundabout way.
</P>
<P>
   Webber explained the bag really belonged to a female companion
(one with very large feet, judging by the size 16 sneakers that
were among the bag's contents).
</P>
<P>
   Imagine: in Dickens' day, you took off your topcoat and draped
it over a mud puddle so your lady wouldn't get dirty. Now it's OK
to drag her name through the mud to keep yourself clean.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you believe Webber's story, you have to shake your head
at his poor judgment. You'd expect a guy who is awaiting trial on
charges of marijuana possession stemming from a traffic arrest in
January to be vigilant to the point of paranoia.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody would jump all over Webber if he took a timeout now.
After all, this is not an NCAA Tournament semifinal game hanging in
the balance. It's his life.
</P>
<P>
   But who's going to level with Webber, the sycophants who call
themselves his friends? The sooner Webber learns to tell a loyalist
from a lackey, the better.
</P>
<P>
   Devotion helped dig Carton's grave in ``A Tale of Two Cities,''
but it was by no means blind. The updated version finds Iverson,
Philadelphia's star guard, being more discriminating about the cars
he buys than the friends he lets use them.
</P>
<P>
   Last month authorities in Norfolk, Va., arrested two men after
they drove away from an alleged drug deal in a $138,000
Mercedes-Benz that they had borrowed from Iverson. One of the men
was charged with possession of marijuana and the other with
possession of cocaine and intent to distribute.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson is standing by the friends. He says they keep him real.
A sense of honor, however misplaced, won't allow him to sever his
childhood ties even if they're strangling him.
</P>
<P>
   You want this remake to end neatly, but you're worried loyalty
will once again get in the way of a happy ending.

Alou's throws his bat into MVP race
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOSEPH DUARTE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ St. Louis' Mark McGwire and Chicago's Sammy Sosa are
chasing baseball history. Pretty soon, they could be chasing one of
the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Not in the home-run race but in the quest to be the National
League's Most Valuable Player.
</P>
<P>
   Moises Alou's campaign unofficially took off Saturday afternoon
in front of 39,886 at Wrigley Field. The fans saw an MVP-type
performance from a Dominican outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   One not named Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   What once looked like a two-party race for the league's top
honor has a third candidate after Alou tied a career high with four
hits, including his 37th home run, in the Astros' 8-3 victory over
the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to hear stuff like that,'' Alou said of being
mentioned as an MVP candidate. ``There are a lot of guys on this
team that have done a great job. It's not like it's my show every
day. Every day is a different guy. I'm happy to be a part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``MVP is something out of my reach. I have no control over that.
Actually, I hadn't even thought about it until a year and a half
ago, when people started talking.''
</P>
<P>
   The whispers are getting louder. Ballots aren't due until late
September, and the race is heating up:
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is the odds-on favorite to break baseball's most
hallowed record _ Roger Maris' single-season home-run record of 61.
McGwire has 52 with five weeks left.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, who went 0-for-5 on Saturday and has 49 home runs, paces
the National League with 124 RBIs and has led Chicago into the
thick of the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Alou's homer total (37) is modest in comparison to his
competitors' numbers. But he in the RBI hunt, with 112, while
hitting .310. Perhaps most important, the Astros are first in the
Central Division and are 30 games above .500.
</P>
<P>
   After going 4-for-5 with two RBIs and three runs scored
Saturday, Alou picked up a big endorsement from teammate Jeff
Bagwell, the NL 1994 MVP.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moises has been a rock in our lineup,'' said Bagwell, who
batted .368 with 39 homers and 116 RBIs in the strike-shortened
1994 season. ``Day after day after day he comes up with big hits
for us. He just doesn't get meaningless hits, he gets big hits, big
RBIs. There is no question in my mind he's the MVP.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the balloting isn't that simple. Most believe the
award will go to the player _ McGwire or Sosa _ who breaks Maris'
mark.
</P>
<P>
   Alou, 32, doesn't consider himself a serious candidate just yet,
but he thinks the award should not be based on individual merit
alone. Despite McGwire's power heroics the Cardinals are under
.500. Sosa, on the other hand, has been the main reason the Cubs
have gone from last place in 1997 to playoff contention.
</P>
<P>
   Few would argue the Astros' acquisition of Alou has been the
difference in this team being 30 games over .500, where last year's
finished just six games over in winning the division title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything about this game is winning,'' Alou said. ``Whoever
is on a winning team should get an edge for the award. The thing is
one of those guys (McGwire and Sosa) has a shot at breaking the
record. They'll probably get it because of the record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe whoever is on a winning team should get
consideration. It could be a guy from the Padres it could be a guy
from the Braves a guy from the Mets or Cubs, if they make the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a guy from the Astros.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou singled three times and hit a solo home run in the fourth
Saturday for the 11th four-hit game of his career. He has 17 homers
since the All-Star break. In the past 16 games he is batting .400
with nine homers and 17 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   In his first year with the Astros, Alou has been named an
All-Star and seems headed for club records for home runs (43) and
RBIs (135). Bagwell holds both.
</P>
<P>
   Which team does Alou consider better, the 1998 Astros or last
year's World Series champion Florida Marlins?
</P>
<P>
   ``We (the Astros) are pretty much ahead because we are in first
place, we're the team to beat,'' Alou said. ``We (the Marlins) had
a great team last year, a great bunch of guys and a great manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we were the wild-card team. We didn't win our division.
Winning the wild card didn't mean we had no shot. We knew we had a
shot against Atlanta because we played them well throughout the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one thing I'm really looking forward about playing
tough teams.''
</P>
<P>
   The next 32 games will help decide who wins the MVP honor.
Speaking from experience, Bagwell won't rule out his teammate.
</P>
<P>
   The similarities are there, and Bagwell has a good idea of what
it takes to win the award.
</P>
<P>
   ``During my MVP year, it seemed like I always came up in a big
situation and always got a big hit,'' Bagwell said. ``I see the
same thing in Moises this year. Somehow, some way, he will hit a
big home run, a double, single, whatever it takes.''

FOOTBALL IN THE BOONDOCKS  
 ISOLATION OF CAMPS HELPS UA, ASU DEVELOP UNITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The football schedules of Arizona and Arizona State say their
seasons officially begin in early September, when stadiums are
filled with fans and Saturday afternoon television is dominated by
games instead of infomercials.
</P>
<P>
   But ASU Coach Bruce Snyder and Arizona Coach Dick Tomey will
tell you something different. Ask Tomey where a winning season
starts and he'll tell you Camp Cochise, near Douglas in the
southeast corner of the state. Ask Snyder and he'll tell you it
starts at Camp Tontozona, 17 miles east of Payson.
</P>
<P>
   It is in training camp, Tomey said, that a team starts to
develop a personality that either will carry it through difficult
times or will collapse under the burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Success is a journey, not a destination,'' said Tomey, who's
picked up a slogan or two from every motivational book he's read.
``And the damn journey is not a four-lane highway. It's not I-10.
It's the back road to Sonoita. It's full of potholes and hairpin
turns.''
</P>
<P>
   While the work at the two camps is nearly identical _ 100 or so
college men hitting, sweating and bonding _ their locations could
not be more different.
</P>
<P>
   Camp Tontozona is carved out of a forest of pine trees (yes,
they are cool and tall), with a creek (yes, it's a babbling one)
that cuts around the edge of the field.
</P>
<P>
   In their spare time, which is as precious as sleep at camp,
players can soak their legs in a cold spring, bait a hook, or take
a short hike to a waterfall. Or they can sit on their cabin porch
and gaze at the beauty of nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, it's surreal,'' said center Grey Ruegamer. ``You're
out in the middle of the woods and you walk out of your cabin porch
and there is a football field. It's like, `Oh, hell, that's what
I'm here for.' ''
</P>
<P>
   At Camp Cochise, players never forget what they are they for. To
get there, you take I-10 east from Tucson, past the exit for the
back road to Sonoita, until you get to Benson. There, you take
Arizona 80, past Bisbee, to Cochise College, a junior college about
eight miles west of Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   The school is in the middle of desert, with cattle ranchers and
flies serving as the only close neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to joke that the Wildcats spent a year there
last week when they went through preseason drills.
</P>
<P>
   It would also be unfair, Tomey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the best facility I've ever seen, including all
the ones the NFL teams use,'' he said of his team's training
accommodations. ``The people are so nice and everything is so well
tied together, the dorms, the meeting facilities, the practice
facilities, the dining hall.''
</P>
<P>
   To Tomey and the players, the isolation of Camp Cochise is
irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Douglas is eight miles away, but it might as well be 108 or it
might as well be two,'' Tomey said. ``We're not going anyplace,
anyway. We don't have any time off.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomey, who coached Hawaii for 10 seasons, raves about the area.
High temperatures usually stay in the 90s. Afternoon storms
routinely roll in, casting exquisitely eerie shadows over the
desert and cooling the sweating players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's breathtaking,'' Tomey said of the scenery. ``There's a
man in charge up there who every night is trying to figure what the
tapestry will look like.''
</P>
<P>
   Tapestry is not a word that Tomey's players would use to
describe Camp Cochise. When he first saw his home for 10 days each
August, junior quarterback Keith Smith wondered what he had gotten
himself into.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing around except this little airport,'' he
said. ``I was thinking, where do you go if you have a serious
emergency?''
</P>
<P>
   When Jeremy McDaniel, a senior receiver, saw Camp Cochise for
the first time he vowed to never set foot off campus after dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it would be a scary place at night,'' he said. ``It's
real dark and the nearest house is about 10 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``But from a team perspective, coming down here brings us
closer. You block out all the bad _ the flies on you every five
seconds _ and pull together as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   To further that goal, Tomey holds what he calls team-building
events that are every bit as important as practice, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, on the final day of camp last Wednesday, he called
off a practice and ordered his team to report to the pool next
door.
</P>
<P>
   There, they held relay races and finished by jumping together in
the water, barking some unintelligible chant.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it will help them win Sept. 3 at Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   There is no cement pond at Camp Tontozona. No comfortable beds.
No privacy. Even the showers are outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've grown to love it,'' said Snyder, whose team concluded
training camp Saturday and plays its first game Sept. 5 against
Washington. ``I like going up there and I don't like leaving it. Up
there, there are no freeways, no elevators, no phones. I can kick
back and coach. When I leave, I'm saddened.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of his players don't feel that way. Sleeping in barracks,
practicing twice daily and endless meetings take a toll. They crave
a return to normal life.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his first visit to Camp Tontozona, senior quarterback Steve
Campbell thought it was paradise. The bus arrived on Wednesday
evening. There was a nice supper. The weather was wonderful.
Putting a football field amid the pines was ingenious.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think, `this is great. I'm going to love this,' '' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he found out his bed sagged in the middle. The fan he
brought was taken over by a fullback and two offensive linemen. The
upperclassmen left their stinking pads in his trailer.
</P>
<P>
   So what if there were pine trees and creeks nearby?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But like Camp Cochise, this is where coaches want players to
bond. Misery brings the freshmen closer together. Nostalgic
evenings work for the upperclassmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``At night, we go out on the porch of our cabin and just talk
for hours,'' Campbell said. And for now, their thoughts aren't on
their traditional rival and their game scheduled for Nov. 27. But
Jackson does have one question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know too much about Douglas. Is it somewhere near
Tucson?''

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Which was the team that had played three
doubleheaders in four days, and which was the team that, by
comparison, was as fresh as a daisy?
</P>
<P>
   By the result of Saturday's game at Shea Stadium, it was
difficult to tell.
</P>
<P>
   It was the New York Mets, whose tanks were supposed to be empty
after the three doubleheaders, who came through when it counted,
pinning a 9-4 setback on the listless Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets used a gutty, seven-inning effort from right-hander
Bobby Jones, pitching on only three days' rest, and a grand slam
from Mike Piazza, his second against Arizona this season and fourth
overall, to delight the crowd of 42,654.
</P>
<P>
   With the Mets (72-57) moving a game ahead of the Chicago Cubs
(71-58) in the National League wild-card race, New Yorkers have
visions of a subway World Series against the cross-town big-shot
Yankees dancing in their heads.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks, meanwhile, dropped their second game in a row
and fifth in their past six. They are 48-82, dashing some team
officials' hopes of reaching the .500 level in their inaugural
season. The primary goal now is to avoid losing 100 games, and
Arizona will have to finish 15-17 to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona jumped to a 4-0 lead in the second inning against Jones
when starting pitcher Andy Benes stroked a two-run double down the
left-field line with the bases loaded and Andy Fox rapped a two-run
single.
</P>
<P>
   Benes, however, bidding for a chance to climb above the .500
mark with his fifth straight win, couldn't hold the lead.
</P>
<P>
   The big right-hander walked three batters in the inning _ all of
whom scored _ gave up a sacrifice fly to Tony Phillips, a
run-scoring infield hit to Edgard Alfonzo and the grand slam to
Piazza on a 3-2 pitch. Piazza's previous grand slam came off the
Diamondbacks' Jeff Suppan in Los Angeles on April 9 when Piazza was
with still with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My control obviously wasn't very good, but as bad as it was, I
still had the opportunity to get out of it, and I didn't,'' said
Benes, who fell to 11-12. ``There were a lot of borderline
pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Those last words were a veiled reference to plate umpire Angel
Hernandez, with whom Benes had a difference of opinion early in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a couple of pitches I thought were strikes that he
said were low, and I said OK,'' Benes said. ``I wasn't trying to
show him up or anything. I think it's fair if you ask a legitimate
question about where the pitch was.''
</P>
<P>
   On one occasion, Hernandez removed his mask and took a few steps
in front of the plate. Manager Buck Showalter came out to talk to
Benes, then, on his return to the dugout, had a few words with the
umpire, although they did not appear to be heated.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' six-run second inning gave new life to Jones, who
scattered eight hits, walked two and struck out five to raise his
record to 9-7.
</P>
<P>
   He got help in the eighth and ninth innings from left-hander
Dennis Cook, a one-time pitcher for the Triple-A Phoenix Firebirds.
Cook, who was a key ingredient for the World Series champion
Florida Marlins as a middle reliever in 1997, held Arizona hitless
while walking one and striking out four.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said Jones had four pitches working _ fastball, change-up,
slider and curveball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't leave many over the plate, so we weren't able to get
real good wood on them,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   He and his teammates knew that Jones was working on three days'
rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when you're in that situation, you don't have the
same zip on your fastball as you normally do, but you can overcome
that by pitching better, pitching smarter, trying to mix things up.
That's what he did today,'' Fox said. &QL;

   PHOENIX - The Coyotes shored up questions concerning their
goaltending situation, apparently striking a deal with Jimmy Waite
to return for a second season as the primary backup to starter
Nicolai Khabibulin.
</P>
<P>
   The signing will be announced within the next few days,
according to a team official, who promised there will be other
moves made during a ``very busy week'' by the Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   It is expected those announcements will include the re-signing
of some of the team's three remaining Group II free agents _
defenseman Keith Carney, right wing Shane Doan and goalie Scott
Langkow.
</P>
<P>
   There also is speculation the team might have landed a free
agent from another team.
</P>
<P>
   The announcements, however, are not expected include star left
wing Keith Tkachuk and the captain's ongoing negotiations regarding
a hefty contract extension, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old Waite, who appeared in 17 games for the Coyotes
last season, became a Group V unrestricted free agent after Phoenix
declined to tender him an offer. At that time, it appeared unlikely
he would be brought back, especially after management made repeated
statements that Langkow would be given every chance at the backup
job behind Khabibulin.
</P>
<P>
   But Waite, a 10-year NHL veteran from Sherbrooke, Quebec,
apparently received little interest from other clubs and thought
his best scenario was to return to Phoenix, where he went 5-6-1
with a team-best 2.12 goals-against average and .913 save
percentage.
</P>
<P>
   He also started two playoff games against the Detroit Red Wings
after Khabibulin sustained a groin injury.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were not available. Waite and his
Philadephia-based agent, Steve Mountain, were unavailable for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The signing, however, eases speculation about the strength of
the team's goaltending situation. For the past two seasons, the
club has had depth problems because of the ongoing knee problems
that ultimately led to the retirement of Darcy Wakaluk. &QL;

RATTLERS STAR EARNS MVP  
 SCHEXNAYDER'S OFFENSE IMPRESSES ARENA LEAGUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Calvin Schexnayder would have preferred to be in Tampa today to
play in the first nationally network-televised ArenaBowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Rattlers star, however, gladly accepted the next-best thing:
the Offensive Most Valuable Player Award.
</P>
<P>
   Schexnayder, who put up record receiving numbers, won the honor
on the eve of the Arena Football League championship game that is
being played by Orlando and Tampa Bay and shown by ABC (Channel 15
at 10 a.m.).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's been a productive year for me,'' he said. ``It's
been one of my best seasons. Of course, it can't top last year,
when we won the championship.''
</P>
<P>
   For the third straight year, the Rattlers won the Commissioner's
Award for top organization. They shared it with the Orlando
Predators, who beat the Rattlers in last week's semifinals under
first-year Coach Jay Gruden.
</P>
<P>
   Schexnayder, a 6-foot, 195-pound offensive specialist, set
league records for receiving yards (1,982) and receptions (136) and
tied the league mark for touchdown catches (44).
</P>
<P>
   He said he still fell short of his goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to score five touchdowns a game,'' Schexnayder said.
``I also wanted to surpass 2,000 yards.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 42-40 loss to Orlando, Schexnayder was held to 77 receiving
yards. In a rout of Grand Rapids, he had 58 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, the man known as ``Shakes'' was brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   Five times he was selected game MVP. He had one of his greatest
efforts in a 59-55 victory over Nashville in the regular-season
finale, a win that clinched home field in the first round of the
playoffs. Schexnayder had 10 catches for 177 yards and five
touchdowns in that game.
</P>
<P>
   The next week, in a first-round victory over Houston, he had
nine catches for 143 yards and four touchdowns and returned three
kickoffs for 70 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Schexnayder was the mainstay on a team that had 14 players go
down because of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if the main criteria on voting for the MVP is how
valuable he was to the team, I can't imagine anyone more valuable
in the light of the injuries,'' Coach Danny White said. &QL;

ANOTHER LATE GOAL TRIPS UP METROSTARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JACK BELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Another late goal, another loss for the MetroStars.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night it was a goal in the 79th minute by D.C. United's
Marco Etcheverry that sent the MetroStars to defeat, 2-1, before
16,729 at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium. The MetroStars (14-12, 38
points) have yielded more than half the 48 goals scored against
them in the last 30 minutes of their games.
</P>
<P>
   For United (21-5, 51 points), the victory was their eighth in a
row in Major League Soccer as the club nears its third straight
Eastern Conference title and a possible third MLS championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just became too individualistic in the second half,''
MetroStars Coach Alfonso Mondelo said. ``I don't know what it is.
Maybe fitness is a problem, even at this point in the season. It's
just been happening too much.''
</P>
<P>
   The match was the first MLS game in 15 days for D.C. United,
which had played three international matches in the Concacaf
Champions Cup, winning the title last week over Toluca of Mexico.
United has not lost a game at home since June 25.
</P>
<P>
   The winning play started deep in the MetroStars' offensive zone
when United quickly restarted play after a foul by the MetroStars.
United defender Jeff Agoos hit a long, low pass to the streaking
Etcheverry, who carried the ball for about 20 yards before
unleashing a left-footed blast from 30 yards out that beat Tony
Meola to the far post.
</P>
<P>
   It was the ninth goal of the season for Etcheverry, United's
playmaking Bolivian midfielder, and merely capped an all-out
offensive assault in the second half by United that saw Roy
Lassiter miss several good scoring chances.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars took a 1-0 lead in the game's 41st minute on a
goal that went completely against the flow of play.
</P>
<P>
   On the scoring play, the team's Chilean international, Marcelo
Vega, did some neat work in the right corner, cutting the ball
around Agoos once, twice, three times before hitting a cross.
United goalkeeper Scott Garlick lunged to get a toe on the ball,
but pushed it directly into the path of the MetroStars' Diego
Sonora, who tapped it in from 5 yards out. It was only the
MetroStars' third shot on goal of the half and only Sonora's third
goal of the season. He got the MetroStars' lone goal in their 5-1
loss at San Jose last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   D.C. United had dominated until that point, controlling the
midfield and putting pressure on the MetroStars' defense.
</P>
<P>
   United's nippy little right wing, the American Ben Olsen, gave
MetroStars defender Mike Petke all he could handle on the right
flank. In the 30th minute, Olsen took a nice lead pass from
United's Etcheverry, went around Petke and struck a pass that
Lassiter, the league's second-leading scorer with 16 goals, hit
first-time but directly into the arms of Meola.
</P>
<P>
   United broke through with the tying goal in the 59th minute,
thanks to a mixup in the MetroStars' defense. Arley Palacios and
Kerry Zavagnin could not get their signals straight on an attempted
clearing pass. Sensing the indecision, United's Jaime Moreno
swooped in and deflected Zavagnin's desperation clearance past
Meola.
</P>
<P>
   CORNER KICKS
</P>
<P>
   _ The MetroStars played without their leading scorer, EDUARDO
HURTADO, who had to sit out the game after accumulating too many
yellow caution cards. Hurtado leads the MetroStars with 10 goals
and is the league leader with 15 assists. Defender MIKE DUHANEY was
also suspended from the game.
</P>
<P>
   _ The MetroStars have scored only 11 of their 50 goals away from
Giants Stadium.

SLOWING DOWN NOT AN OPTION  
 AT 39, SPEEDY HENDERSON UP FOR STEALS TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Quietly, almost too quietly,  &UR; Rickey Henderson is doing what he
set out to during spring training. Henderson, arguably the best
leadoff hitter in the history of the game and a sure-fire Hall of
Famer, wanted to lead the American League in stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   With just five weeks remaining in the season, Henderson not only
leads the AL in that category but the entire major leagues. If
Henderson, 39, holds on, he will become the oldest player ever to
lead the majors in stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Eddie Collins of the Chicago White Sox was 37 when he led the
majors with 42 stolen bases in 1924. Henderson entered the weekend
leading Cleveland's  &UR; Kenny Lofton by 13 stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``These old bones still have some life in them,'' Henderson said
during spring training. Now I don't want this out until at least
the All-Star Game, but I plan to lead the league in steals again.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, who leads the AL in walks, has won 11 stolen-base
titles since his rookie season with Oakland in 1979. Interestingly,
Henderson, baseball's all-time stolen base king, has not led the
league in stolen bases since 1991, when he had 58.
</P>
<P>
   This is a player who has often made it difficult to be
understood. His actions throughout his 20 years in the majors have
often made him an easy target of numerous detractors. But, believe
it or not, Henderson is not the demon he's been made out to be.
</P>
<P>
   There were times in his career when Henderson's actions were
inappropriate and selfish. But when it came time for the playoffs
or making a playoff run, there were few players on the same level
as Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   There was a 10-year window there, from about 1981-90, when
Henderson was probably the best overall player in the game. There
was little he could not do, and even someone of  &UR; Don Mattingly's
stature realized Henderson was the best player in the game, an
answer he gave when asked back in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will always talk about me,'' Henderson said. ``I can't
change what anyone thinks about me. But I think people who follow
the game know I have given everything to the game.'' &QL; 
Dodger Stadium II? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The good folks at FOX have learned that it will cost upwards of
$200 million to upgrade Dodger Stadium the way they envision, with
all those money-making luxury boxes they want to build.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if they're going to pony up $200 million, well, an
additional $200 million could build a brand new ballpark, a
consideration the FOX brass is tinkering with. The hope among
Dodgers fans and baseball fans who have ever been to what is still
considered one of the most picturesque ballparks in the game, is
that the current Dodger Stadium will remain.
</P>
<P>
   Club President  &UR; Bob Graziano insists the front office is
committed to renovating the 36-year-old park that still looks new
and will simply add the 60-75 luxury suites in the near future.
However, he does not rule out the other option, which would be a
sad statement for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a chance the costs can be such that when you look at
the risk and the incremental increase in revenue that you stop and
think, `Boy, this doesn't make much sense,' '' Graziano said.
``There is a chance of that happening, which is what we're trying
to decide now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not started evaluating (a new stadium) yet. We're
trying to show how we can make sense out of a renovation. ... But
when you look at renovation costs, it can get close to being as
high as building a brand-new stadium. That's a concern.'' &QL; 
Very rare air &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What do  &UR; Ken Griffey Jr.,  &UR; Juan Gonzalez,  &UR; Albert Belle and
 &UR; Andres
 &UR; Galarraga have in common? All could join a select club of players
who have driven in 400 runs over a three-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the weekend, Gonzalez needed four, Griffey eight,
Galarraga nine and Belle 27 to join a list of 48 players who have
accomplished the rare feat, last done by  &UR; Vern Stephens from
1948-50. The three-year record is help by the immortal  &UR; Lou Gehrig,
who had 509 RBI from 1930-32. &QL; 
Cone of silence &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New York Yankees pitcher  &UR; David Cone, attempting this season to
win his second Cy Young Award, needed to pitch 37 more innings
entering Saturday's start before a contractual clause that will
allow him to become a free agent kicks in.
</P>
<P>
   If Cone reaches 200 innings he can walk away from his 1999
contract. While Cone won't say for certain what he will do, he made
it known that he was impressed with  &UR; Paul O'Neill's new contract
extension, which will pay him far less than if the right-fielder
had gone on the open market.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, Cone will probably try to pry a pay raise out
of
 &UR; George Steinbrenner for next season. &QL; 
AZ bad as he wants to be &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Montreal Manager  &UR; Felipe Alou, one of the most respected
managers in the game, had a strong position to take when asked his
thoughts on Bank One Ballpark last week, his first trip to Phoenix
for a big-league game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another building to make money _ a factory,'' Alou said.
</P>
<P>
   Alou was also amused that the Diamondbacks were so jacked after
winning the first game of the series last Monday, moving Arizona
within 1{ games of the Expos overall this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a stadium that costs that much, a payroll of $30
million, and they put catching us as a goal?'' Alou asked. ``That's
ridiculous.'' &QL; 
Captain Jack speaks &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati Manager  &UR; Jack McKeon's quotes of the week:
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to church the other day to pray for our pitchers, but
there weren't enough candles.''
</P>
<P>
   After learning his Reds are 51-45 against every club other than
Atlanta, Houston and San Diego: ``If we didn't have to play the
division leaders, we'd be fighting for the wild card.''
</P>
<P>
   THE HIT LIST &QL; 
 &UR; Where's Pookie?: The New York Mets first- and third-base coaches
are  &UR; Mookie Wilson and  &UR; Cookie Rojas, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; If only those games didn't have to count: Seattle was 4-20 in
games decided by one run, entering the weekend. The Mariners are on
pace for the fewest one-run wins in a 162-game season, a record
held by the Texas Rangers. They managed 11 such wins in 1985. The
overall big-league record is nine by Cleveland in 1948 and 1953 New
York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback: Reggie Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; This guy's pitching better than ever and here's
 &UR; proof: Atlanta's  &UR; Greg Maddux can become the second pitcher since
1920 to win the ERA crown with an ERA of less than 2.00 in three
different years. Only Hall of Famer  &UR; Sandy Koufax has accomplished
the feat.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; We'll throw in this Bob Feller  &UR; guy; great fastball,
 &UR; he's just a little old: The three pitchers Cleveland sent
Cincinnati on July 31, 1997 _  &UR; Scott Winchester,  &UR; Danny Graves and
 &UR; Jim Crowell _ have all undergone rotator cuff surgery. &QL; EXTRA
BASES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Maddux won his 200th game last week, making three active
pitchers with at least 200 victories. Coincidentally, one of the
others has a locker just a few feet away _ Atlanta Braves teammate
 &UR; Dennis Martinez has 244 wins. Next on the list is Toronto's  &UR; Roger
Clemens, who has 228.
</P>
<P>
   For San Francisco to overtake San Diego for first place in the
National League West, the Padres would have to finish 17-17 while
the Giants would need to go 33-3. Of course, the Padres' real
battle is chasing the Braves for the home-field advantage in the NL
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Ageless reliever  &UR; Jesse Orosco pitched in his 55th game of the
season for Baltimore last Tuesday. Big deal? Well, for Orosco it
was. His 1999 contract automatically kicked in at that point.
Orosco, 41, is the Orioles oldest player, but he had the lowest ERA
at 2.70 entering the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Curtis Leskanic set the six-year-old Colorado Rockies record
for consecutive scoreless innings last week when he reached 19
innings, since upped to 21.  &UR; Willie Banks has the on-going
Diamondbacks record, also at 19 innings, for the five-month-old
club.
</P>
<P>
   Embattled Braves reliever  &UR; Mark Wohlers has sent signals that he
will agree to be sent on another rehabilitation assignment Aug. 31,
a move that will allow the club to bring up someone else to be
eligible for the post-season roster. Players brought up after Sept.
1 are not eligible for the playoff roster.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's 5-4 victory over Baltimore last weekend prevented
the Indians from being swept by the Orioles in a series of at least
three games since 1971. Back then,  &UR; Mike Cuellar,  &UR; Pat Dobson and
 &UR; Jim Palmer threw three complete games in a four-game sweep at
Municipal Stadium. &QL; THE RUMOR MILL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland wouldn't necessarily mind trading  &UR; David Justice
during the off-season. The problem is that Justice, who hasn't
complained once about being moved from outfield to designated
hitter, is owed $28 million over the next four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Shawn Estes, a 19-game winner for San Francisco last season, is
looking at making a rehabilitation assignment next week. If all
goes well, Estes, who has begun throwing batting practice, could
return by the end of the month. Of course, that's a big maybe.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Mariners may be trying to change the player to be
named in the trade that sent  &UR; Randy Johnson to Houston in exchange
for four players. Initially, the Mariners agreed to receive pitcher
 &UR; John Halama. Now they apparently want an upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that keeping outfielder  &UR; Dante Bichette in a Rockies
uniform will take a four-year commitment from Colorado. Early word,
though, has the team worried about Bichette being 38 in the final
year of the contract. Colorado seems more intent on offering a
two-year deal with an option year.
</P>
<P>
   New York Yankees General Manager  &UR; Brian Cashman is attempting to
pry pitcher  &UR; Brian Boehringer from San Diego. Boehringer used to
pitch for the Yankees. The Padres, who seem willing participants,
are seeking  &UR; Shea Morenz, a Double-A outfielder. The Yankees are
seeking insurance for injured reliever  &UR; Jeff
 &UR; Nelson. &QL; Includes information from other media sources. Pedro

D-BACKS EXTEND FORD'S STAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Not so fast,  &UR; Ben Ford. &UR; You're not going anywhere,
after all.
</P>
<P>
   The right-handed pitcher, who thought he was on his way back to
Triple-A Tucson on Friday after one day in the big leagues,
remained with the Diamondbacks instead, as right-hander  &UR; Bobby
Chouinard was placed on the 15-day disabled list because of a
strained posterior muscle in his throwing shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Under normal circumstances, Ford would have to remain with
Tucson for 10 days before being recalled, but since this involves a
player going on the DL, he will be allowed to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Chouinard had been experiencing some discomfort for a brief
period and thought it would go away, but it did not. Chouinard, who
pitched the ninth inning of Friday night's 1-0 loss in
Philadelphia, will return to Phoenix with the club after Monday's
game here against the Mets and begin a rehabilitation assignment in
Tucson. &QL; 
Bernard's back &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder  &UR; Bernard Gilkey returned to Shea Stadium on
Saturday for the first time since being traded from the Mets on
July 31. He responded with a pair of hits and was thrown out by
catcher
 &UR; Mike Piazza while trying to steal second in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on both sides of the fence here,'' said Gilkey, who
began his career with the St. Louis Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed playing here. The fans are pretty good in general.
They get on you when you're the home team, and they get on you when
you're the visiting team. They get on everybody. It's what they
do.'' &QL; 
White out again &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder  &UR; Devon White sat out the game because of the same
tight hamstring that caused him to miss four games earlier in the
week.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting a game-winning homer in the 11th inning of the
second game of a doubleheader in Philadelphia on Thursday night,
White nearly sat out Friday night's game against the Phillies but
decided to play. He went 0 for 2 with a pair of walks.
</P>
<P>
   As he was when he was previously sidelined, White will be
evaluated daily. &QL; 
Worth the wait &QL; 
 &UR; Chris Michalak said it was the moment he had been working for all
his life _ a chance to pitch in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   The dream came true Saturday, when he pitched two innings,
struck out two and gave up a run on one hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I walked in from the bullpen (to begin the seventh
inning), the mound seemed like about three miles away,'' said
Michalak, called up from Triple-A Tucson late Thursday night.
``When I got there,  &UR; Jay ( &UR; Bell, &UR; shortstop) and  &UR; Kelly
( &UR; Stinnett, &UR; catcher) were waiting. I took a look around for a
second to take it all in, then concentrated and went to work.''
</P>
<P>
   After striking out the first two batters he faced in the seventh
inning,  &UR; Brian McRae and  &UR; Todd Hundley, &UR; Michalak got  &UR; Carlos
 &UR; Baerga on a pop-up to right for the third out. In the eighth, he
gave up a bloop double to leadoff man  &UR; Rey Ordonez, &UR; who later
scored on a groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Of the double that fell into shallow left-center, Michalak said,
``He (Ordonez) did a good piece of hitting. That's part of the
game. I was pleased with how I pitched.'' &QL;

CATS' CALLEN SHOWS HIS STUFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ For a year, he tried to outrun anonymity. Friday night,
there was a sign he might do it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Leon Callen outran the Arizona defense.
</P>
<P>
   On one play, he bounced off a would-be tackler at Arizona
Stadium and raced for 50 of his scrimmage-high 71 yards.
</P>
<P>
   For one moment, Callen, who had six carries, looked like the
``Parade'' ``Magazine'' All-America prized prospect he was in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   What happened in between? A serious knee injury in 1997 and
grade problems sidelined Callen, also a sprinter with world-class
speed in the 100 meters (1.5) and 200 meters (21.3).
</P>
<P>
   Then, there other prized recruits  &UR; Trung Canidate and  &UR; Leo
 &UR; Mills. But Canidate, the designated starter from Phoenix, is
recovering from an injury. Mills, a freshman and another ``Parade''
All-American, also was impressive during the scrimmage with six
carries for 29 yards and two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a book. Chapter 1: Leon doesn't know if he's going
to make it,'' Callen said before the Wildcats opened their
preseason camp. ``Chapter 2: Leon is back in school. Chapter 3: Leo
Mills. Chapter 4: Trung Canidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The final chapter is going to be: How are they going to
co-exist?''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, Callen gives the Wildcats some critical depth.
It's not known when Canidate will return. He is trying to
strengthen his right leg, which was in a cast for five weeks
because of a stress fracture. Mills' academic eligibility is still
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the battle for the starting job appears to be between
Callen and reliable senior &UR; Kelvin Eafon, who rushed seven times for
25 yards and a touchdown. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Briefly
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats won't practice Monday, the start of classes. Coach
 &UR; Dick
 &UR; Tomey said his team will scrimmage again on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback &UR; Ortege Jenkins appeared to have an edge over rival
 &UR; Keith Smith with his scrimmage performance. Jenkins completed 8 of
18 attempts for 133 yards. Smith was 1 for 6 for 5 yards and an
interception. But Jenkins wasn't happy. ``I wasn't in an OJ mood,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The toughest adjustment starts this week, Tomey said at the
conclusion Wednesday of camp at Cochise College near Douglas. ``The
guys have been able to handle tough conditions and tough
discipline,'' he said. ``The next week's adjustment in Tucson _
with academic details, books to buy, players' friends around, our
guys living all over town _ will be much more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Possible third-string quarterback &UR; Peter Hansen, a freshman from
Palo Alto, Calif., is 6 feet 7. His size has earned a nickname from
Smith and Jenkins. ``Baby Leaf,'' referring to former Washington
State quarterback  &UR; Ryan Leaf, a 6-foot-5 San Diego Chargers
rookie. &QL;

SUN DEVILS SHOW WHY THEY HAVE HIGH HOPES

<P>
   CAMP TONTOZONA _ Just minutes after his team closed camp with a
public scrimmage, Arizona State Coach Bruce Snyder called his
players together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you can sense it, but people expect you to be
something special,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A record 5,000 fans congregated outside Payson for a sneak
preview of the much-hyped Sun Devils. What they saw was a defense
that will be better than expected, new players with big-play
capabilities and a kicking game that still needs work.
</P>
<P>
   ``A national championship, that's our goal,'' quarterback Ryan
Kealy said. ``We expect nothing less.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the hits and misses:
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tenuous state of Marlon's Farlow's future, ASU is
deep at running back.
</P>
<P>
   With Heisman Trophy candidate J.R. Redmond playing sparingly _
Snyder knows what he can do _ the coach got a closer look at
Daveron Hightower, Gerald Green and Larry Montgomery, the Nos. 2, 3
and 4 tailbacks, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Hightower, who was slowed by a blood clot in his right big toe,
carried 10 times for 47 yards and two touchdowns. Green, who
quickly is becoming a crowd favorite, rushed for 49 yards and one
touchdown, and Montgomery carried five times for 42 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still can't really plant and cut like I want to,'' Hightower
said. ``That wasn't my best.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils unveiled their new secret weapon: Steve Campbell,
special teams player extraordinaire.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder had talked about using the 6-foot-8 quarterback to block
field goals, but he hadn't practiced it during camp. Campbell was
sent out during the scrimmage to do exactly that and he blocked
two.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we go. I'm a quarterback and everybody wants to talk
about blocking field goals,'' Campbell said smiling. ``Actually, it
feels really good.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, who is battling for the No. 2 spot with redshirt
freshman Chad Elliott, has had the best spring of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure this will probably be the last year I go out and play
quarterback,'' he said. ``I might as well go out and enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   The kicking game is still shaky.
</P>
<P>
   With efforts of 45, 55 and 55 yards, redshirt freshman Stephen
Baker showed he may blossom into a solid punter. But neither Baker
nor Mike Gauthier made a convincing argument for the starting
place-kicking job.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Nycz was so consistent last season, it was easy to forget
just how valuable he was. Snyder didn't seem overly concerned, and
believes both players have the potential to be like Nycz.
</P>
<P>
   The team has plenty of big-play potential.
</P>
<P>
   Senior wide receiver Lenzie Jackson worked on improving his
speed this season and he seemed almost a step faster. He connected
with Kealy for a 75-yard pass play.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Alfred Williams, who has been lost in the hype
surrounding ASU's other newcomers, showed why Snyder has talked him
up recently and had the scrimmage's only interception.
</P>
<P>
   What defensive concerns?
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils' front held its own and didn't seem to lose a
step when the second team came in. Returning starting tackle Albrey
Battle was joined by tackle Ryan Reilly and ends Quincy Yancy and
Derrick Ford on the first team.
</P>
<P>
   Junior college transfer Junior Ioane, a defensive tackle, made
one of the plays of the game when he stuffed running back Green and
tossed him aside.
</P>
<P>
   Linebackers Adam Archuleta, Joe Cesta and Stephen Trejo, who are
expected to start the season, as well as Eric Fields, who may very
well see as many minutes, played well.

NO WADSWORTH DEAL ON HORIZON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   No longer are Cardinals officials optimistic they will get
first-round draft pick  &UR; Andre Wadsworth signed before the start of
the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides remain almost $20 million apart and negotiations
appear at a standstill because both sides have dug in their heels.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth is demanding a four- or five-year deal that voids
after as early as three seasons while the Cardinals remain adamant
they won't give him any contract that includes voidable years.
</P>
<P>
   The only possible solution, unless the Cardinals can convince
Wadsworth their word is gold and they will positively, absolutely
tear up the contract after three seasons, is for a short deal _ one
to three years _ but the team is unable to give Wadsworth the $10
million signing bonus he is seeking unless the contract is spread
out over six years.
</P>
<P>
   For the longest time, the Cardinals didn't take Wadsworth
seriously when he said he would go back to school and re-enter the
draft next year. They figured he had a target date when he would
report and that he would make sure he was in camp before the Sept.
6 season opener at Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals now know Wadsworth isn't bluffing. He is serious
about sitting out the entire year.
</P>
<P>
   He's not desperate for money. He isn't from poverty. In fact,
his father owns a successful business on the Virgin Islands.
</P>
<P>
   To Wadsworth it's a matter of principle, but it also should be a
matter of interest, the interest he won't get on the $10 million
bonus the Cardinals are offering.
</P>
<P>
   Many fans can't understand how Wadsworth can pass up $10
million. But he is convinced he can get a similar bonus in next
year's draft even if he isn't picked as high as third overall
again.
</P>
<P>
   But if he sits out, he and the Cardinals lose, and nobody
suffers as much as his agent,  &UR; Eugene
 &UR; Parker, who will have to find a way to explain to prospective
clients why he turned down the third-biggest signing bonus in NFL
rookie history.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals lose because they will take the field without the
best defensive lineman prospect to enter the NFL in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Their image, the image they've worked so hard to change, also
will take a beating. They will be reminded over and over again that
the last first-round pick to sit out an entire season also was
drafted by the Cardinals _ Colorado State quarterback  &UR; Kelly
Stouffer in 1987, a year before the team moved to the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   So far, public opinion has been on the Cardinals side during the
Wadsworth holdout. But that will change if they begin the regular
season without him, and, especially, if they don't win.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody will accuse them of being cheap, just of being inflexible
and showing no creativity in trying to get the deal done.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth will survive. He'll just play for another team in
1999, one that gives voidable contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals will take a bigger hit as they try to get a new
multipurpose, domed stadium. &QL; 
Back to future &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So now Oakland Raiders owner  &UR; Al Davis wants to move back to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the dynamic football team that sells out stadiums and
wears silver and black,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   His team has sold little more than 30,000 season tickets this
year, fewer than the Cardinals, who play the Raiders next Saturday
in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders moved back to Oakland in 1995 after Davis was
guaranteed by the Oakland Marketing Association that 175 luxury
suites would be sold. Many haven't even been built yet. &QL; 
Rough ride &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh Steelers punter  &UR; Josh Miller, an Arizona product, and
kicker  &UR; Norm Johnson missed the team's bus back to Pittsburgh from
training camp in Latrobe, Pa. So they climbed inside the equipment
truck and rode 60 miles.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a comfortable ride. Around one turn, some equipment
moved and buried Johnson, who could have taken a cab for $70. &QL; 
Short shots &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Chiefs linebacker  &UR; Terry Wooden, a resident of
Scottsdale, still is furious that the team wouldn't release him in
the off-season. ``My feelings haven't changed at all,'' he said.
``If anything, every day they just grow, and I want to be here less
and less, and my resentment grows more and more. Terry Wooden is
not a backup. It's tough to get up every day, and it's tough to
come out on the field, and it's tough to find enthusiasm. Every day
is a living hell.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Cardinals sign Wadsworth, they will have three rookies
who were defensive players of the year in their conferences _
Wadsworth, a Florida State product, in the Atlantic Coast
Conference, Arizona State linebacker  &UR; Pat Tillman in the Pac-10 and
Southern Mississippi linebacker  &UR; Marchant Kenney in Conference USA.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals running back  &UR; Adrian Murrell wants it known that his
wife,  &UR; Tanya, and son,  &UR; Tylan, do not have sickle cell anemia but
carry the trait.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay guard  &UR; Jorge Diaz, on the rising Buccaneers: ``Last
season, we were raw and hungry, and we ate the appetizer. This
season, we want the whole meal.''

NEW BIG-GAME PERMIT SYSTEM WORKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRT BURKHART  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - There may be nothing more controversial among hunters
than the computer drawing for big-game permits.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona is one of the fastest growing states in terms of human
population. Its big-game populations aren't growing that fast. In
fact, recent drought years have drastically reduced the number of
mule deer permits. Even elk, which are extremely adaptable, took a
hit.
</P>
<P>
   The number of big-game permits fell as the number of hunters
wanting them rose.
</P>
<P>
   I once was drawn for elk three years in a row. I haven't been
drawn since. When I was getting the permits, friends (I guess they
were) gave me a full ration of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Game and Fish is setting it up so you'll get drawn,'' they
said with a snarl. Since I've gone several years without being
drawn, they've ignored the situation. Perhaps they think Game and
Fish has determined that I shouldn't get drawn anymore. Whatever,
they're liking it.
</P>
<P>
   The computer draw isn't a setup. I know two high-ranking Game
and Fish officials who messed up their elk applications this year.
They were rejected. One was making application for two friends at
the same time. Of course, they were rejected, too. You think this
guy hasn't faced the needle? It's brutal out there.
</P>
<P>
   The computer draw is impersonal. For a long time, it made its
random decisions with no mitigation. If you applied for a trophy
bull elk permit, it meant the odds were overwhelming against you
getting it. There were so many more applications than permits that
those who were drawn should have been dancing in the streets. Some
of them probably were.
</P>
<P>
   But, there always was this problem of applicants who had a black
cloud over their heads. They'd go year after year submitting an
application and never get drawn.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, it seemed, had a solution, except Game and Fish. I've
seen some of the darndest proposals from hunters to correct the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   The old guys thought they deserved to bypass the younger ones
for a permit, figuring they might be dead before they got drawn
again. Who said so? I'm getting to be pretty ancient myself, and I
never figured I had more rights to a permit than anyone else. There
were some applicants who said they hadn't been drawn for seven
years. That black cloud over their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Then, believe it or not, a couple of Valley residents, Larry
Knipp and Dan Westfall, came up with a plan that even got the
attention of Game and Fish. They came to a public meeting of the
Arizona Game and Fish Commission in Flagstaff with more than a
``pity me'' syndrome. They laid out the mathematics in a brochure,
showing how a more equitable system could be implemented.
</P>
<P>
   Every year a hunter wasn't drawn for, say, elk, a bonus point
would be recorded on the file. If the hunter was willing to take
Game and Fish's hunter education course, there would be a another,
one-time bonus point. The latter was Game and Fish's idea.
</P>
<P>
   For any given hunt number, 10 percent of the permits would be
reserved for those with the highest number of bonus points. If
hunters with the highest numbers weren't drawn, they'd also be
eligible for the regular computer drawing.
</P>
<P>
   Game and Fish bean counters checked out the mathematics, found
them to be valid, and the plan was implemented.
</P>
<P>
   This year's drawing was the second that the bonus point system
has been in effect. And it's working.
</P>
<P>
   The current system is applied to elk, antelope, bighorn sheep
and bison. Deer will be included next year.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the maximum bonus points a hunter could accrue was
eight. We'll give you some figures first, then explain them with
the help of Ray Lee, big game supervisor for Game and Fish.
</P>
<P>
   Let's use elk as an example. Seventy-one of 225 applicants with
eight bonus points were drawn for an elk permit for a success ratio
of 31.56 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There were 616 with seven bonus points, and 346 were drawn for a
56.17 percent success rate. The 1,296 persons with six bonus points
drew 617 permits, a 47.61 percent ratio.
</P>
<P>
   Now you're going to ask why those with eight bonus points drew a
smaller percentage of permits than those with seven or six.
</P>
<P>
   Lee can explain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people with eight points went after an early bull
(trophy) rifle hunt,'' he said. ``The chances of getting that
permit normally are 100 to 1 against. The people with all the
points seemed to put in for hunts that are harder to get. The odds
are against them, even with bonus points.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they'd gone after an archery cow permit, their chances
would have been more than 90 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   I tried for a November bull hunt in Unit 7. I didn't get it.
Someone with eight bonus points would have had a good chance
because the computer favors those points. &QL;

SPICE (Phoenix) _ They're here. The Spice Girls grabbed a stage in

sensations are pregnant and a swirl of British tabloid reporters
wanting to report on the upcoming love children. Meanwhile, young

DRUGWAR _ America's drug czar will soon propose sweeping remedies
to try to patch gaping holes in the Southwest border, where tons of
cocaine and marijuana continue to slip through undetected. The
proposals, the result of two years of study, will be announced this
week and will include putting a federal official in charge of each
of the 24 entry points and naming a coordinator to oversee the
entire 2,000-mile border. By JEFFBARKER. Story will move in the

HILLARY (Undated) _ Women's rights advocates around the nation seem
to be worried that Hillary Rodham Clinton's continuing gracious
attitude toward her husband's infidelity reflects submission and
repression, the opposite of what a feminist role model should be.
By MAUREEN WEST. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL;

 &QL; 
CLINICS (undated) _ Imagine a medical clinic where your surgeon
isn't really a surgeon; he's a dermatologist who took extra
classes. The staffer who reads your X-rays is learning as he goes;
other clinic employees are so untrained they don't even know know
cardiopulmonary resuscitation. If a crisis erupts during your
postsurgical recovery, your best bet is to call the Fire
Department. Many outpatient procedures are not regulated by the
state, by medical associations, by the federal government or anyone
else. By JODIE SNYDER and SUSIE STECKNER. Story will move in the
``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MARRIAGE (Phoenix) _ They have already promised God to love, honor
and cherish. But about 75 married couples wanted to find out
Saturday how to get the state of Arizona involved. ``Before God,
we're vowed. We've already made the commitment that divorce is not
an option,'' said 35-year-old Kim Schmidt, standing next to her
34-year-old husband, Marc. The Schmidts, who've been married 15
years, were among the information seekers who attended a seminar at
the downtown Hyatt in Phoenix on Arizona's new covenant marriage
law. By RICHARD RUELAS. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL;

MONTINI-COL (Phoenix) _ Sooner or later, you'll catch on. You'll be
downtown, looking west toward the Washington Monument, and see only
a saguaro. Or you'll be on the eastside, where the Capitol dome
should dominate the skyline, watching instead as the dome of a
thundercloud boils over an unbroken horizon. And you'll know _ in
spite of this newspaper's distortions and deceptions _ that you DO
NOT live in Washington, D.C. You live in Phoenix. By E.J. MONTINI.
Story will move in the ``A'' and ``K'' categories. &QL;

IRISH, NORTH AND SOUTH, MARK WEEK SINCE TERROR BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (subs 2nd graf to change 19 to 29)  (nk) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   OMAGH, Northern Ireland _ Tens of thousands of people in
Northern Ireland and in the Irish Republic observed a painful
minute of silence at 3:10 Saturday afternoon, the exact time a week
ago that a terrorist bomb killed 28 people in the center of this
small market town.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb, which left 220 injured, 75 of whom are still
hospitalized, was the deadliest terrorist atrocity in 29 years of
sectarian violence in this mostly Protestant British province.
</P>
<P>
   A Catholic splinter guerrilla group, the Real IRA, which wants
the Republic to take over the North, claimed responsibility for the
attack. The police are questioning two men, but no one has been
charged.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted a united Ireland,'' said Amanda Heffernan, a
clerk. ``Now we're united in grief.''
</P>
<P>
   The blast was commemorated in public assemblies in dozens of
cities and towns here and in the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish
Republic. Irish President Mary McAleese spoke briefly. Her father's
pub near the border with the Irish Republic was blown up by
Protestant terrorists 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, who has advanced harsh legal
measures to combat terrorism, attended the ceremony at the
courthouse in Omagh, a few hundred yards from where the bomb went
off. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott represented the British
government.
</P>
<P>
   The Real IRA, which split from the Irish Republican Army this
year, announced a cease-fire last week. And Saturday, another
Republican splinter group, the Irish National Liberation Army,
followed suit, a development officials say should enhance the peace
agreement approved in referendums here and in the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Ahern called the latest cease-fire pledge ``good news at the end
of a bleak and tragic week.''
</P>
<P>
   The Irish National Liberation Army's last admitted violent act
was on June 25 when a car bomb destroyed part of the border town of
Newtownhamilton, wounding 11 people.
</P>
<P>
   The statement _ announced at the west Belfast headquarters of
the group's political representatives, the Irish Republican
Socialist Party _ means that only one anti-British organization in
Northern Ireland, the Continuity IRA, has yet to call a truce. All
major Protestant paramilitary groups have already called
cease-fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that the political situation has changed since
the formation of INLA,'' the statement said. ``We recognize that
armed struggle can never be the only option for revolutionaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the people of the whole island of Ireland ``have
spoken clearly as to their wishes,'' it acknowledged ``faults and
grievous errors in our prosecution of the war.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Innocent people were killed and injured and at times our
actions as a liberation army fell far short of what they should
have been,'' it said. ``For this we as republicans, as socialists
and as revolutionaries offer a sincere and heartfelt apology.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday in Omagh, a mostly Catholic city of 20,000 set in the
cow-studded hills of bucolic central Ulster, the people in the town
center and in nearby parking lots with loudspeakers listened to the
prayers of Protestant and Catholic clergymen. Many wept and many
more seemed to be fighting back tears.
</P>
<P>
   A few directed some of their anger at the Real IRA.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Cunliffe, 68, a retired truck driver and a native
Englishman, said: ``It is disgusting to see what one human being
can do to another. If it was mad dogs, you would put them down.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When the minute of silence began, Kathleen Heffernan picked up
her granddaughter, Tara, 4, hugging and nuzzling her. Half of the
dead in the blast were children.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Heffernan talked about her niece, Stephanie Colton, 16, who
was seriously wounded in the blast.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a piece of the car, the car-bomb car, stuck on her
chest,'' she said. ``She nearly lost a foot. On Tuesday they are
going to try to take the stones out from around her eyes, the
gravel that the bomb blew at her.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Heffernan said her niece recalled that, seconds before the
blast, as police officers alerted to a bomb mistakenly led crowds
toward the explosion, not away from it, an older woman had turned
to her and her friends and said, ``This is the real thing, this
time, girls.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The girls began to laugh at the woman,'' Ms. Heffernan said.
``Then the blast hit them.''
</P>
<P>
   All around her, people were teary-eyed and spoke in low voices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this means the end of the war,'' said Joseph Harley,
owner of a construction equipment company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' said his wife, Veronica. ``But too late for Omagh.'' &QL;

COLLINS WITHDRAWS APPEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB MEICH  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ After Friday night's defeat to the Toronto Blue Jays,
Angels manager Terry Collins said he had about a ``zero percent''
chance of winning an appeal of a controversial ruling in the second
inning by home-plate umpire and crew chief Larry Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Collins withdrew his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   With the score 1-1 in the bottom of the second inning on Friday,
the Angels had the bases loaded, with Edmonds on third, when Gary
DiSarcina lined a single to right field. The Blue Jays then threw
Garret Anderson, who had hardly moved off second base, out at
third.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Walbeck touched second, saw Anderson and retreated toward
first when the Jays threw to second for the inning-ending double
play. Edmonds had long since scored. But because of the forceout,
Edmonds' run didn't count and DiSarcina didn't get the hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were too many screwy things going on out there at the
same time,'' Collins said. ``Larry Bennett has seen more games than
I have, and he'd never seen that. And I didn't tell him I thought
he was wrong. But I thought (Jimmy Edmonds should have scored), so
I appealed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday afternoon, Collins invited writers to visit his
clubhouse office, where he had a copy of the game's rules,
including 7.08 (j), in ``The Runner'' section.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Collins entered his office and studied the
passage further. He must have acknowledged the futility of fighting
the call then, because an Angels official announced the withdrawal
in the press box in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds sits: Angels center fielder Jim Edmonds, who strained
back muscles while running into the wall in the ninth inning on
Friday night, was replaced in the lineup on Saturday by Reggie
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds, with his back to home plate, got a glove on the ball,
hit by Toronto right fielder Shawn Green. But in an instant the
ball popped loose, Edmonds looked down for it and momentum carried
him into the wall. Green wound up with a triple. Collins said he
hopes Edmonds returns by Monday, when the Angels begin their
five-game series against the Yankees in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Martin gets a start: Collins said he will play Paco Martin in
place of DiSarcina at shortstop this afternoon against the Blue
Jays. Martin, who has four hits in his last 34 at-bats, was
activated off the disabled list (strained neck) on Friday. Collins
said he wants DiSarcina, 30, fresh for the team's 10-game trip to
New York, Boston and Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching matchups: Steve Sparks, Saturday night's starter, will
start the second game of Wednesday's doubleheader against the
Yankees, according to Collins. Jack McDowell (Monday), Omar
Olivares (Tuesday), Jeff Juden (Wednesday's first game) and Chuck
Finley (Thursday) had already been penciled in for their starts
against the Yanks.
</P>
<P>
   David Wells, who tossed a perfect game earlier this season, is
slated to start Wednesday's second for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Finley (9-6) starts for the Angels today (1:05 p.m.) against
Woody Williams (9-8). Finley is 7-6 with a 4.40 earned-run average
in more than 143 innings lifetime against the Jays.
