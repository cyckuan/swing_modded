   You fill stadiums for big soccer games.
</P>
<P>
   You're the toast of Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   At America West Arena on Monday, you'll stage the second WNBA
All-Star Game, a celebration of acceptance that nonetheless
struggled to fill even $10 seats.
</P>
<P>
   You've come halfway, baby.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three decades after Congress enacted Title IX and threw
the weight of law behind gender equity for amateur female athletes,
that's the official assessment of the Women's Sports Foundation, or
WSF.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're halfway'' to equity, said Donna Lopiano, executive
director of the WSF, founded by Billie Jean King in 1974 to seek
justice for women bucking the male-dominated American jockocracy.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say halfway isn't a long way.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, the year before Title IX mandated that no American
``shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be
denied the benefits of or be subjected to discrimination under any
educational program or activity receiving federal financial
assistance,'' fewer than 300,000 girls played high school sports.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, according to foundation statistics, the total was 2.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Participation in intercollegiate athletics, also regulated under
Title IX, has grown at a slower pace, but nonetheless gains have
been substantial, especially in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, athletic scholarships for women totaled less
than $100,000 nationally, according to the WSF. Currently, the
total tops $180million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the WSF's advocacy hotline averages three to four calls a
day from sports-program participants who suspect inequities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day there's a new unbelievable,'' said Lopiano.
</P>
<P>
   A classic example, close to home: Desert Vista High School
opened a few years ago in Phoenix with a sparkling baseball field
for boys but not a single softball field for girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's resistance - I think it's (lack of)
knowledge,'' said Sister Lynn Winsor, athletic director and coach
at Xavier College Prep in Phoenix. ``You go up to someone and say,
`You've got a wonderful boys' baseball facility with concrete
dugouts. And the girls are sitting on three little park benches.'
It's not that they don't want to - it's that they don't think of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Winsor, an Xavier coach and administrator for 26 years, serves
on a committee of the Arizona Interscholastic Association that
evaluates state schools for gender equity. It's not enforcement,
exactly, but rather positive reinforcement - the committee hands
out an annual prize to schools that have made the most progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look around Arizona, I think we're one of the better
states,'' said Winsor, who's also served as an officer for a
national coaches association. ``We've come a long way, especially
compared to some of the Southern states. They really have some
issues to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a lot of change. I'm impressed by what's happening.
Sometimes change is painful, but it's for the best.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights, or
OCR, is charged with enforcing Title IX. This summer, several
Valley high schools are upgrading facilities to comply, and an OCR
spokesman said there are no open complaints in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The Desert Vista softball situation wasn't resolved until a
player's father threatened a Title IX complaint. Title IX scholars
dub it the ``Mad Dad'' phenomenon - fathers who played sports as
kids who now insist on equal opportunity for their daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has definitely been a father-led movement,'' said
Lopiano. ``It's not a women's initiative at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Lopiano said, the women's movement did not initially
embrace sports as a battlefront.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sport was originally how we trained men for war,'' Lopiano
said. ``They didn't think it was a healthy thing for women at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Dad was there right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, she said, the first generation of mothers to enjoy Title
IX-decreed equality are coaching their young daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you thought Dad was rabid, wait until Mom gets into it,''
she said. ``You don't want to ever see your children discriminated
against.''
</P>
<P>
   College scholarships, which drive participation at lower levels,
are viewed as crucial to the continued march toward sports equity.
Title IX requires that women be awarded scholarship dollars
proportional to their participation in a school's athletic
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Another index by which schools are measured is whether the
percentage of female athletes matches the percentage of female
undergraduates.
</P>
<P>
   That test has proved somewhat vexing to sports administrators at
Northern Arizona University, where female enrollment has grown from
52percent to 56 percent in the past few years. In the 1998-99
school year, 48.5 percent of NAU's student athletes were women, up
from 36 percent in the 1996-97 school year.
</P>
<P>
   One way NAU achieved its gains is a rallying point for
gender-equity critics, who point out that Title IX has been most
painful to participants in minor sports for men. To meet equity
mandates, many colleges have eliminated teams.
</P>
<P>
   Attributing the cut to Title IX, Northern Arizona University,
which had recently added soccer and golf teams for women, last year
dropped men's swimming and diving. More than 50 Division I colleges
have killed wrestling programs in the past two decades. Gymnastics,
tennis {ndash} even baseball {ndash} have been threatened or axed
at colleges around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, fiscally you have to say, We can't add another
female sports if the dollars aren't there,''' said Steve Holton,
NAU's athletic director. ``The only way to stay in compliance with
the federally mandated law is to eliminate men's sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Title IX's inception, various male-sports coaches'
associations have mounted organized opposition, and repeated
efforts have been made to exempt football from equity formulas.
According to the Women's Sports Foundation Gender Equity Report
Card for 1997, women gained a net increase of 1,658 National
Collegiate Athletic Association programs since 1978. During the
same years, total men's programs also increased, by 74. However,
schools in the NCAA's Divisions I-A and I-AA, the largest
universities that tend to have the largest athletic programs,
showed a decrease in the number of men's sports programs, a net
loss of 152.
</P>
<P>
   According to the WSF, the explosive growth in female
participation in high school sports during the past couple of
decades didn't dim growth for boys programs. In 1971, 3.6million
boys played high school sports. In 1998, 3.7million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Title IX, I really can't see the sharing of resources
that was required to really give women the opportunity to play,''
said Lopiano. ``It has been a tooth-and-nail fight every step of
the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The WSF estimates that 80percent of America's college and
universities are not yet in full compliance with Title IX, though a
recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll indicates that more than
three-fourths of the sample supported the drive to equity - even if
it means further cuts in men's programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think that the general public gets it,'' Lopiano
said. ``The problem is not the general public. It's the
decisionmakers holding the purse strings of sports, a small group
of dinosaurs.''
</P>
<P>
   David F. Salter, author of 1997's (beginitalic)Crashing the Old
Boys' Network: Tragedies and Triumphs of Girls and Women in
Sports(enditalic), said that the 1996 Summer Olympics, where
several American women teams won gold medals, was a watershed
moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really look at the Atlanta Olympics as the culmination of
the first 20 years of the Title IX effort,'' he said. ``From there,
the growth and quality of females athletic programs has improved
dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   But Salter warned: ``I'm afraid that men and women, fathers and
mothers will get the impression that because we have the WNBA on
television, because we have the World Cup soccer team getting a lot
of publicity, that we've overcome these Title IX challenges, and
the momentum slows or stops.''

which had recently added soccer and golf teams for women, last year
dropped men's swimming and diving. More than 50 Division I colleges
have killed wrestling programs in the past two decades. Gymnastics,
tennis {ndash} even baseball {ndash} have been threatened or axed
at colleges around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, fiscally you have to say, We can't add another
female sports if the dollars aren't there,''' said Steve Holton,
NAU's athletic director. ``The only way to stay in compliance with
the federally mandated law is to eliminate men's sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Title IX's inception, various male-sports coaches'
associations have mounted organized opposition, and repeated
efforts have been made to exempt football from equity formulas.
According to the Women's Sports Foundation Gender Equity Report
Card for 1997, women gained a net increase of 1,658 National
Collegiate Athletic Association programs since 1978. During the
same years, total men's programs also increased, by 74. However,
schools in the NCAA's Divisions I-A and I-AA, the largest
universities that tend to have the largest athletic programs,
showed a decrease in the number of men's sports programs, a net
loss of 152.
</P>
<P>
   According to the WSF, the explosive growth in female
participation in high school sports during the past couple of
decades didn't dim growth for boys programs. In 1971, 3.6million
boys played high school sports. In 1998, 3.7million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Title IX, I really can't see the sharing of resources
that was required to really give women the opportunity to play,''
said Lopiano. ``It has been a tooth-and-nail fight every step of
the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The WSF estimates that 80percent of America's college and
universities are not yet in full compliance with Title IX, though a
recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll indicates that more than
three-fourths of the sample supported the drive to equity - even if
it means further cuts in men's programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think that the general public gets it,'' Lopiano
said. ``The problem is not the general public. It's the
decisionmakers holding the purse strings of sports, a small group
of dinosaurs.''
</P>
<P>
   David F. Salter, author of 1997's (beginitalic)Crashing the Old
Boys' Network: Tragedies and Triumphs of Girls and Women in
Sports(enditalic), said that the 1996 Summer Olympics, where
several American women teams won gold medals, was a watershed
moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really look at the Atlanta Olympics as the culmination of
the first 20 years of the Title IX effort,'' he said. ``From there,
the growth and quality of females athletic programs has improved
dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   But Salter warned: ``I'm afraid that men and women, fathers and
mothers will get the impression that because we have the WNBA on
television, because we have the World Cup soccer team getting a lot
of publicity, that we've overcome these Title IX challenges, and
the momentum slows or stops.''

<P>
   You fill stadiums for big soccer games.
</P>
<P>
   You're the toast of Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   At America West Arena on Monday, you'll stage the second WNBA
All-Star Game, a celebration of acceptance that nonetheless
struggled to fill even $10 seats.
</P>
<P>
   You've come halfway, baby.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three decades after Congress enacted Title IX and threw
the weight of law behind gender equity for amateur female athletes,
that's the official assessment of the Women's Sports Foundation, or
WSF.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're halfway'' to equity, said Donna Lopiano, executive
director of the WSF, founded by Billie Jean King in 1974 to seek
justice for women bucking the male-dominated American jockocracy.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say halfway isn't a long way.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, the year before Title IX mandated that no American
``shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be
denied the benefits of or be subjected to discrimination under any
educational program or activity receiving federal financial
assistance,'' fewer than 300,000 girls played high school sports.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, according to foundation statistics, the total was 2.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Participation in intercollegiate athletics, also regulated under
Title IX, has grown at a slower pace, but nonetheless gains have
been substantial, especially in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, athletic scholarships for women totaled less
than $100,000 nationally, according to the WSF. Currently, the
total tops $180million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the WSF's advocacy hotline averages three to four calls a
day from sports-program participants who suspect inequities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day there's a new unbelievable,'' said Lopiano.
</P>
<P>
   A classic example, close to home: Desert Vista High School
opened a few years ago in Phoenix with a sparkling baseball field
for boys but not a single softball field for girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's resistance - I think it's (lack of)
knowledge,'' said Sister Lynn Winsor, athletic director and coach
at Xavier College Prep in Phoenix. ``You go up to someone and say,
`You've got a wonderful boys' baseball facility with concrete
dugouts. And the girls are sitting on three little park benches.'
It's not that they don't want to - it's that they don't think of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Winsor, an Xavier coach and administrator for 26 years, serves
on a committee of the Arizona Interscholastic Association that
evaluates state schools for gender equity. It's not enforcement,
exactly, but rather positive reinforcement - the committee hands
out an annual prize to schools that have made the most progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look around Arizona, I think we're one of the better
states,'' said Winsor, who's also served as an officer for a
national coaches association. ``We've come a long way, especially
compared to some of the Southern states. They really have some
issues to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a lot of change. I'm impressed by what's happening.
Sometimes change is painful, but it's for the best.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights, or
OCR, is charged with enforcing Title IX. This summer, several
Valley high schools are upgrading facilities to comply, and an OCR
spokesman said there are no open complaints in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The Desert Vista softball situation wasn't resolved until a
player's father threatened a Title IX complaint. Title IX scholars
dub it the ``Mad Dad'' phenomenon - fathers who played sports as
kids who now insist on equal opportunity for their daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has definitely been a father-led movement,'' said
Lopiano. ``It's not a women's initiative at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Lopiano said, the women's movement did not initially
embrace sports as a battlefront.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sport was originally how we trained men for war,'' Lopiano
said. ``They didn't think it was a healthy thing for women at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Dad was there right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, she said, the first generation of mothers to enjoy Title
IX-decreed equality are coaching their young daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you thought Dad was rabid, wait until Mom gets into it,''
she said. ``You don't want to ever see your children discriminated
against.''
</P>
<P>
   College scholarships, which drive participation at lower levels,
are viewed as crucial to the continued march toward sports equity.
Title IX requires that women be awarded scholarship dollars
proportional to their participation in a school's athletic
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Another index by which schools are measured is whether the
percentage of female athletes matches the percentage of female
undergraduates.
</P>
<P>
   That test has proved somewhat vexing to sports administrators at
Northern Arizona University, where female enrollment has grown from
52percent to 56 percent in the past few years. In the 1998-99
school year, 48.5 percent of NAU's student athletes were women, up
from 36 percent in the 1996-97 school year.
</P>
<P>
   One way NAU achieved its gains is a rallying point for
gender-equity critics, who point out that Title IX has been most
painful to participants in minor sports for men. To meet equity
mandates, many colleges have eliminated teams.
</P>
<P>
   Attributing the cut to Title IX, Northern Arizona University,
which had recently added soccer and golf teams for women, last year
dropped men's swimming and diving. More than 50 Division I colleges
have killed wrestling programs in the past two decades. Gymnastics,
tennis {ndash} even baseball {ndash} have been threatened or axed

</P>
<P>
   ``THE SOUL OF A CHEF''
</P>
<P>
   By Michael Ruhlman
</P>
<P>
   (Viking, $26.95)
</P>
<P>
   That pizza from Uncle Sam's looked mighty good to us after we
finished reading about the pressure and politics behind the making
of great food. In the first part of this book, Ruhlman, who wrote
on the same subject in (beginitalic)The Making of a
Chef(enditalic), investigates the grueling certified master chef
exam at the Culinary Institute of America (where one participant
was berated for his ``knife skills'' after a slice of duck terrine
turned up wider at one end than at the other). Part two moves to
the kitchen of the personable Michael Symon of Cleveland's Lola
Bistro and part three to California's French Laundry, opened by
Thomas Keller (who had no formal culinary training) in 1994 and
three years later called ``the most exciting restaurant in
America'' by Ruth Reichl of the (beginitalic)New York
Times(enditalic). The Keller chapters are the best, showing both
the chef's severe perfectionism and the relentless stress under
which he and his staff create extraordinary meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE UNWANTED GAZE''
</P>
<P>
   By Jeffrey Rosen
</P>
<P>
   (Random House, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   Rosen, legal affairs editor of the (beginitalic)New
Republic(enditalic), takes a disturbing look at the legal and
social changes that ``have undermined our ability to control how
much information about ourselves is communicated to others.'' If
that sounds harmless, consider this: E-mail, even deleted, is
really a permanent record that can be retrieved by employers or
prosecutors at any future time. Kenneth Starr was able to confront
Monica Lewinsky with love letters written on her computer but never
sent to Bill Clinton, and later he was able to subpoena receipts of
Lewinsky's book purchases for 1995. Rosen also offers the
controversial suggestion that Clinton's alleged actions with Paula
Jones in that infamous Little Rock, Ark., hotel room did not
constitute sexual harassment but an invasion of her privacy. He
makes a complex subject fascinating by showing us how vulnerable we
all are. His message: Pay attention. It could happen to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``WERE YOU ALWAYS AN ITALIAN?''
</P>
<P>
   By Maria Laurino
</P>
<P>
   (Norton, $23.95)
</P>
<P>
   When Mario Cuomo graduated from law school and tied for first
place in his class, the dean suggested that he change his name in
order to get a job on Wall Street. ``Can you imagine me as Mark
Conrad?'' Cuomo asked Laurino, and then he posed the question that
became her book's title, establishing between them a bond of ethnic
ambivalence. Yes, she once wanted to change her name to Laurin, to
free her of her Italian identity. And, no, she could not imagine
him as Mark Conrad. A warning: This is no warm and fuzzy book of
Italian jokes and anecdotes, with some references to
(beginitalic)The Godfather (enditalic)thrown in for good measure.
With intelligence and honesty, Laurino discusses her family, her
self-image, the contradictory effects of her ethnicity (she winces
at books and documentaries on ``the Italian-American experience,''
yet is quick to romanticize her own history) and the fierce ties
that hold her to a heritage she does not completely understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``A GATHERING OF SPIES''
</P>
<P>
   By John Altman
</P>
<P>
   (Putnam, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the reference to Cary Grant and Carole Lombard on the
first page, but this book has the feel of one of those great old
movies about World War II. If you were to compare it to another
novel, it would be Ken Follett's (beginitalic)Eye of the
Needle(enditalic). Unlike Follett's Henry Faber, however, Altman's
spy is a woman. Katarina Heinrich has murdered a friend, assumed
her identity and married her employer, plodding Princeton scientist
Richard Carter. In true old-movie tradition, Richard is invited to
work on the bomb project at Los Alamos, N.M., and his stunned wife
goes along, planning her next move on behalf of Germany. Meanwhile,
British authorities recruit aging professor Harry Winterbotham to
spy for them, and Harry sees an opportunity to rescue his Jewish
wife, who was caught in Poland during Hitler's invasion. Are you
taking notes? Good, because there's more. It's all easy,
old-fashioned fun. Just bring the popcorn.

prostitutes) can wave to their wives.''But not everybody is
pleased. By MIKE MCCLOY. Story will move in the ``A'' category.

ANDERSON FINDS LINE-DRIVE SWING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Garret Anderson's four hits Sunday against the San
Diego Padres were a season high, but more notable than the number
of hits was the type of hits they were. Singles. All four, with no
home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson has a career-high 26 homers this season for the Anaheim
Angels, but his average has been in the .240 range most of the
season, considerably below his .300 lifetime average going into the
season. The four hits Sunday raised his average to .256, the
highest it had been since April 24 (.260).
</P>
<P>
   Is the line-drive hitting Anderson back?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's been back for a while,'' hitting coach Mickey
Hatcher said. ``He admitted to himself he was trying to do too much
and was guessing instead of seeing the ball and reacting.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher said Anderson finally got frustrated enough recently to
sit in manager Mike Scioscia's office with Scioscia and Hatcher and
discuss his problems. During the meeting, Scioscia and Hatcher let
Anderson do all the talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a new contract (four years, $20 million) and he was
putting too much pressure on himself,'' Hatcher said. ``He sat back
and evaluated himself. . . . He needs to trust himself. He's got
great hands and is a great hitter. Mike and I always tell him at
the end of the year you're going to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher said he expects to see Anderson's average get back to
normal but not at the expense of his home run total.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'll hit more home runs,'' Hatcher said. ``He's not
getting himself out. He's giving himself a chance to be aggressive
in certain situations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to take what they give me,'' Anderson said.
``(Sunday) the pitches were down in the zone and I did what I had
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Salmon hurting: Right fielder Tim Salmon was not in the
starting lineup Monday night because of an inflamed left shoulder.
His shoulder has been bothering him for the past couple of weeks,
but he irritated it Sunday afternoon trying to make a sliding catch
of Kevin Nicholson's double.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon drove to Orange County on Monday afternoon to have the
shoulder examined by Dr. Lewis Yocum.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon's status is day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Pitcher Kent Mercker, trying to come back from
a cerebral hemorrhage suffered May 11, threw a bullpen workout
Monday and had ``good velocity,'' according to Scioscia, but ``it's
still like spring training for him.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Scott Schoeneweis will make his second rehab start
Wednesday for Triple-A Edmonton. Schoeneweis, recovering from a
strained rib-cage muscle, will need to make at least one more rehab
start following Wednesday's before he will rejoin the rotation.

<P>
   Xerox, Memorex, Betamax , Napster?
</P>
<P>
   If the company behind the file-sharing software wants some
comfort, it could consider its multitude of lawsuits a sort of
badge of honor. After all, like the copy machine, recordable
audiotape and the VCR, Napster makes information sharing easier.
It's just that a lot of that shared information happens to be
copyrighted.
</P>
<P>
   So, the entertainment industry has turned to lawsuits. Trouble
is, Napster has created the potential for millions of people to
break the law, and even if it's shut down, there are similar
programs out there that would gladly take its place. So, the
industry is left with some scenarios:
</P>
<P>
   Adapt to the new technology - Traditionally, this has taken the
entertainment industry the longest to do. The most famous example
is Hollywood's lawsuit to ban Sony's Betamax, the VCR's precursor.
Sony won, and the movie industry went on to make billions off
videotape sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time a new product is introduced, it seems the
entertainment industry has fought it,'' says Mike Blevins, a
spokesman for the Home Recording Rights Coalition in Washington,
D.C. ``It's mind-boggling when you consider how different our lives
might be if the VCR weren't here today.''
</P>
<P>
   Figure out ways to discourage the making of illegal copies -
This could be done by either making encryption so complicated that
it's not worth the time to hack, or by providing content in an
equally easy, yet legal, way.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are getting easy access to a good product at a fair
price with no hassles in getting that product, then the vast
majority of people will choose legal content,'' says Geordie
Wilson, consumer-products manager for the Windows Media Player.
</P>
<P>
   Hope the ambiguity of current digital copyright law swings in
favor of the copyright holder - So far, it has.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is the high-water mark for programs like
Napster,'' says Jonathan Zittrain, executive director of the
Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School.
``It's not going to be a free-for-all years from now. Those who are
gnashing their teeth and saying, `God, the only way I'm going to
get on the Internet is if I'm giving stuff away,' I think it's
going to be a very different landscape soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Ian Clarke, a 23-year-old e-commerce consultant from London,
sees it differently.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1999, he completed work on Freenet, a file-sharing
program designed to give its users anonymity. Ideally, it would be
used in such countries as China or Saudi Arabia, where free speech
is prohibited. The program, however, is blind to the type of
information shared, meaning that copyrighted material could be
traded as easily as recipes.
</P>
<P>
   In Clarke's world, all information eventually will be free,
effectively nullifying the entire concept of copyright.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that as communications technology improves, it will
become increasingly difficult to restrict the sharing of
information,'' he says. ``Freenet makes it extra-difficult, if not
impossible, to restrict the sharing of information.''
</P>
<P>
   Realistically, that's far from happening, and the entertainment
industry is doing everything it can to make sure it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1998, the recording industry and technology
companies teamed up to form the Secure Digital Music Initiative to
devise a framework for the playing, storing and distribution of
material. Meanwhile, lawsuits, many involving interpretations of
1998's Digital Millennium Copyright Act, continue to shape the law.
</P>
<P>
   If history repeats itself, then this is merely the industry's
growing pains. That's the belief of Leonardo Chiariglione, the
Italian engineer who in 1988 helped form the Moving Picture Experts
Group, a team of international experts in audio and video. The
group created a standard for compressing large audio files, called
MPEG-1, Layer 3, or MP3, the popularity of which has led to the
trading of digital music and, eventually, Napster's success.
</P>
<P>
   So, the recording industry turned to Chiariglione for help,
asking him to head the Secure Digital Music Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   As he puts it, ``New technologies, new possibilities, new
threats and new technologies to cope with the threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiariglione said he sees that threat spreading to movies,
electronic books and video games.
</P>
<P>
   In film, that's happening already. A compression format called
DivX - sharing the name of the failed Circuit City plan for
pay-per-view DVDs - that combines elements of MPEG technology has
steadily gained popularity on the Web. For now, the factors
limiting DivX - besides the fact that much of the content is in
violation of copyright laws - are that files are about 100 times
larger than MP3s, the selection of films is minimal and its success
depends on whether people want to watch movies on their computers.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the success of MP3s has shown, the market for
downloadable content is there. Although the music industry has to
play catch-up, film companies and book publishers have some time to
prepare. That's where the burgeoning field of digital-rights
management comes in.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of how such companies work, in June the
digital-rights management firm Reciprocal offered a secure download
of the trailer for Adam Sandler's upcoming film (beginitalic)Little
Nicky(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   Users download the trailer from the film's Web site. Upon the
first viewing, a users must connect to Reciprocal's Web site and
enter his or her e-mail address and ZIP code, after which the user
will receive a certificate that's stored on his or her computer.
</P>
<P>
   The file can be traded with other users, but each subsequent
person must apply for the certificate upon the initial viewing. The
(beginitalic)Little Nicky (enditalic)trailer is free; in the case
of, say, a new Britney Spears single, a person could have to pay
for the file before listening to it the first time; each other
person to whom the file was sent also would have to pay. That
defeats the notion of one person paying for the song and putting it
on Napster for everyone else to have.
</P>
<P>
   The key is making it simple. The more complicated the process,
the less likely a person is to go through it. But the less secure
the process, the less likely a company will be to make content
available.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a balance that has yet to be achieved in the
marketplace,'' says Larry Miller, president of Reciprocal's music
division. ``Content providers have to be confident enough to make
it available for consumers to enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other side, you have to make it seamless. You don't
want the technical solution to override the consumer's need to make
it a seamless, maybe even fun, experience.''

 &HT;    DECENTRALIZED FREENET OPEN TO EXPLOITATION(a)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ian Clarke's vision is the entertainment industry's nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   In developing a program called Freenet, designed to allow the
anonymous, free trade of information, Clarke was hoping to help
further the notion that free speech is fundamental by giving
residents of restrictive countries a tool to speak their minds
without fear of censorship.
</P>
<P>
   It is a decentralized network - no one controls it, so no one
can shut it down. Napster is centralized; shut it down, and the
network goes with it.
</P>
<P>
   Like other file-sharing programs, Freenet (available at
freenet.sourceforge.net) lacks the ability to distinguish between a
top-secret CIA file and a dog photo. This means that if users want
to exploit Freenet by trading copyrighted material (or even child
pornography), they can. No one controls Freenet; no one can stop
them.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke says that it wasn't designed for that, but that he can't
do anything about it. After all, Freenet was built to resist
attempts to remove information from it. But it also was designed so
that the most requested information remains in the network.
Information few are interested in - say, an anonymous missive about
your controlling boss - will die out, replaced by other files.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even if the entertainment industry suffers, Clarke fails
to sound that broken up about it. His opinion is that technology
will improve to the point that it will be impossible to control
what kind of information is shared. All information will be free;
nothing will be copyrighted.
</P>
<P>
   Absurd? Perhaps. But look at Napster: Even though such irate
bands as Metallica have identified users who trade copyrighted
files, its popularity persists, despite the threat - however remote
- of legal action. Gnutella, a less-popular program that, like
Freenet, is decentralized, offers near-anonymity. So what happens
when a program achieves perfect anonymity?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it'll be that the idea that you can kind of prevent
people from copying and sharing information will just seem
ridiculous,'' Clarke says from his London home.
</P>
<P>
   Censorship is a hot topic for Clarke, especially now that the
British government is considering laws allowing police to view
private e-mails. As countries attempt to legislate the Internet,
Freenet could be a way to skirt those laws.
</P>
<P>
   But although Freenet allows for anonymity, such technology as
digital signatures could allow for some type of accountability. It
would be comparable to receiving a series of anonymous letters all
in distinguishable handwriting; the person is recognizable, but not
identifiable. That's important in differentiating between a dingbat
and Deep Throat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody posts allegations without any kind of support,
then anyone who believes it is really kind of an idiot,'' Clarke
says. ``Why not let the people reading it decide what's the truth?
You can't really trust any information that is completely
anonymous.''

REMARKABLE RUNYAN HAS SYDNEY IN SIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ The night before the final of the women's
1,500 meters, Marla Runyan was lying in bed when her boyfriend,
Matt, realized she probably wasn't fast asleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were there in complete silence, and he asked what I was
doing. I said, `I just ran the race three times in my head, and I
got third place two out of the three times,' '' Runyan said.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, Runyan walked up to her place at the starting
line at Hornet Stadium, drew a breath, and 4:06.44 later, she
indeed came in third, winning a trip to Sydney behind Regina Jacobs
and Suzy Favor Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   For Runyan, like so many elite athletes, visualization is
everything. For Runyan, who is legally blind, visualization really
(begin italic) is (end italic) everything.
</P>
<P>
   Runyan, 31, has dealt with a degenerative eye disease since age
9. A strict interpretation of Stargardt's Disease would say that
Runyan's world, seen through clouded retinas, has been reduced to a
blur of shapes and colors.
</P>
<P>
   That is a ridiculously limited interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really think as much about my vision as the media
does. And I don't think my competitors do, either,'' Runyan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my personality is _ I'm just an athlete. My vision is
a circumstance that just happened. I never said I wanted to be a
legally blind Olympian. I just said: `I want to be on the Olympic
team. Me, Marla.'''
</P>
<P>
   As frustrating as it may be to constantly be reminded of her
so-called disability, Runyan is incredibly generous in answering
questions, without a whiff of impatience in dealing with the
attention.
</P>
<P>
   She perfectly walks the line between dismissing the 30/200
vision she uses to get around and evidencing what it takes to
overcome the so-called disability.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of what I've achieved, I can't tell you the number
of letters I've gotten from parents, children and teenagers who
have the same or similar condition. It makes me feel good to affect
people in a positive way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Runyan has steadfastly refused to be boxed in by any definition,
which is how her talents found an outlet as a high jumper at San
Diego State.
</P>
<P>
   Later, she turned to the heptathlon _ memorizing the number of
steps between each hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   She was ranked 10th nationally before the 1996 Olympic Trials,
but instead competed in the World Paralympic Games, winning four
gold medals as she overwhelmed her opponents.
</P>
<P>
   It was time to find a better outlet. So she turned to middle
distance running _ a move that indicates Runyan's tenacity.
</P>
<P>
   After clocking the world record for the 800 meters during a
heptathlon, Runyan tried to talk her way into the 800 during the
1998 Prefontaine Classic in Eugene, Ore. The race director said no,
since she had not met the sub-2:00 qualifying time. Instead, she
worked her way to an entry in the 1,500.
</P>
<P>
   By July 1998, she had won the Pan American Games.In August, she
finished fourth at the World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   She has since moved to Eugene, where she is ensconced in a
network of runners and supporters. Runyan said she is just
beginning to explore the 1,500, the 5,000 and possibly the 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   By now, there's nothing to stop her _ except the other injuries
that hamper elite runners in their quest.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, what really put these Olympic Trials in doubt was the
injury she sustained June 9. While running on a trail near her
home, she had to jump out of the way of a kid on a bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   On the track, Runyan has learned to steer wide in turns, careful
to avoid collisions, even though this tactic can cost her time.
</P>
<P>
   She distinguishes her fellow racers by memorizing who has a
ponytail or who is blonde.
</P>
<P>
   It can be harder to prepare for real-world mishaps. The
near-miss caused her to strain the band of tendons that run from
her hip to her knee.
</P>
<P>
   In pain, she couldn't jog, let alone train. She spent two weeks
in Colorado Springs, Colo., for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   She flew home and told her parents she wasn't going to run in
the Trials. Then, on the plane home to Eugene, she decided to go
for it, even though her coach, Mike Manley, would barely let her
run a serious warm-up before the 1,500 final.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a remarkable woman,'' Manley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would have destroyed most other athletes. She has a
tremendous physical gift, but she has the mental strength to
overcome problems and focus on what she needs to do to get where
she wants.''
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to be overwhelmed this Olympic season by the wondrous
talent of Michael Johnson or Marion Jones. These once-in-a-lifetime
superstars are the king and queen of American track.
</P>
<P>
   But there are others in the kingdom, and Marla Runyan's ticket
to Sydney can be credited to her awesome resolve. Watching her run,
you get a sense of her triumph.

<P>
   The public's hunger for ``reality-based programming'' has
brought us (beginitalic)Cops, Rescue 911 (enditalic)and
(beginitalic)America's Funniest Home Videos.
</P>
<P>
   (enditalic)Combine them, film it in Phoenix, and you'd have
something that could be called (beginitalic)Joe's Jail,
24/7.(enditalic)
</P>
<P>
   Which - without the name - is coming to the Internet courtesy of
Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Monday, all the drama and mayhem of 300 people being
booked daily will be available for public viewing with just a click
on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be educational,'' Arpaio said. ``It'll be a deterrent.
Maybe those guys who get busted on Van Buren Street (for soliciting
prostitutes) can wave to their wives.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is amused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a problem with that,'' said Eleanor Eisenberg,
executive director of the Arizona Civil Liberties Union. ``Sheriff
Joe often seems to forget that a lot of people in his care haven't
been convicted of a crime. Putting them on the Internet for all the
world to see is an invasion of privacy that is not warranted.''
</P>
<P>
   Even people who are convicted deserve better, Eisenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are convicted have the human right to be treated
with some sense of human dignity, but we don't seem to want that to
happen,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Arpaio said the public should be allowed to see what
happens inside the jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the difference if you take a picture right away and put
it in the newspaper or put it over the Internet?'' Arpaio said.
``There really is no difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Viewers who visit www.mcso.org will be warned that anything can
happen as two color cameras follow inmates through booking and down
a hallway to the bowels of the Madison Street Jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be scary if I'm supposed to have the worst
jail in the United States,'' the sheriff said. ``What if the
inmates give me the finger all the time? What if they take their
pants down?''
</P>
<P>
   The site is believed to be the first in the country to take
viewers live inside a jail.
</P>
<P>
   However, county Supervisor Don Stapley said that, without
including inmates' vulgar and deranged screams or the odor of
unwashed vagrants and vomiting drunks, the sheriff's $2,000
investment of taxpayer money on Web cameras will not offer much
reality to viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to be able to show much,'' he said, noting
that the jail intake center has many hallways and alcoves where
incoming inmates are sent for physical and psychological
evaluations, background checks and assignment to various security
levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would question the utility of this kind of expenditure,''
Stapley said. ``But I'll have to withhold judgment until I
understand what they intend to show.''
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio said he wants to overcome the negative image created by
the jailhouse death of inmate Scott Norberg in a restraint chair in
1996. Norberg's family settled a wrongful death suit against
Maricopa County for $8million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody says we killed Norberg,'' Arpaio said. ``People
think inmates are getting the hell beat out of them. I'm getting
tired of all these allegations. Now everybody can see.''

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If Larry Ellison ever breaks out of his rut as
No. 3 richest being in the solar system (behind God and Bill Gates,
not necessarily in that order), maybe he'll buy a bigger boat.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Ellison will paddle along in his 192-foot power
boat, Izanami, which he moors at Sausalito.
</P>
<P>
   Or does Sausalito moor at Izanami?
</P>
<P>
   The Belvedere Beachcomber says the local salts consider Larry's
tub to be the sports model of the Aegis missile cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   Izanami's monthly electric bill is $6,000, which takes skipper
Larry a good eight seconds to earn. The engines have to be kept at
160 degrees even when the ship's not in use, so air conditioning
the engine room eats up serious wattage and coinage. That and the
ship's electric can openers.
</P>
<P>
   When the boat cruises at 37 knots, it sucks up $500 worth of
diesel fuel per hour. So it uses more fuel than a Ford Exploitation
or Lincoln Fumigator.
</P>
<P>
   Nosy folks speculate that the lavish on-board entertaining of
certain Japanese investors means something big is afoot at Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   SPEAKING of SUVs, why is it that the chromiest and shiniest
vehicles on the road are the four-wheel-drive sport-utes?
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that like putting a doily on the seat of a tractor?
</P>
<P>
   LOCAL AUCTION house Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield will hold a fossil
auction next month, the star of which will be a 200
million-year-old winged reptile.
</P>
<P>
   The Icarosaurus siefkeri is expected to fetch about $300,000. So
if you're shopping for Larry Ellison's birthday, this might make a
nice chew toy for his dog.
</P>
<P>
   I'm going to wait until the fossil market is flooded with
knockoffs and the prices comes down.
</P>
<P>
   FOR RENT, a nice little two-bedroomer in Noe Valley, and the
owner was asking $1,800 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, more than 100 prospective renters showed up, each
kicking in the $100 credit-check fee that the owner was asking in
hopes of weeding out casual shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   The place finally rented for $3,000 per.
</P>
<P>
   DANGER LURKS everywhere in this city.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Kaufman sends a frightening listing from the July issue of
Bay Area Parent magazine, from the calendar of events:
</P>
<P>
   ``Storyteller and harpist Nancy Thym tells `The Stolen Bairn and
the Sidh,' the Scottish Highland tale of a woman whose baby is
stolen by fairies at the California Academy of Sciences.''
</P>
<P>
   And Tinkerbell is the  &UR; capo de tutti capos,  &LR; right?
</P>
<P>
   GET HIGH and be clean forever more.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you can become the Bathing Betty or Bill who will sit in
the bathtub that perches on the roof in front of Caldwell's Factory
Outlet on Bayshore Blvd.
</P>
<P>
   The original mannequin bathed in that tub for decades, a
semi-historical piece of roadside kitsch, but fell down and broke
in last winter's storms.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell's is searching for a worthy native San Franciscan to
serve as the model for the next Betty.
</P>
<P>
   To apply for the job, write a letter to Caldwell's explaining
why you are best qualified. Include a snapshot, birthday suit not
required.
</P>
<P>
   THOSE CUTE new scooters, admit it, you have to have one.
</P>
<P>
   We all do. And soon we all will, and can you imagine how many
pedestrians are going to be run down by scooter people? And how
many cars are going to have to go to the body shop to have scooters
removed from their grills?
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean to represent doom &AMP;  &LR; and gloom, but if we can't
handle the current pedestrian-motorist-bicycle mix, what will be do
when a million madly zipping scooters are tossed into the formula?
</P>
<P>
   WITH A SONG on his lips and a package in his arms, Dave McCann
has brightened the mood at City Hall and Civic Center since 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Dave is the Singing UPS Man, nonstop belter-outer of Broadway
show tunes, barbershop quartet hits and whatever else hops onto the
turntable of his internal jukebox.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, next month Dave is retiring. The city will be a quieter,
duller place.
</P>
<P>
   I hereby nominate Dave for the Whirlitzer Prize.

</P>
<P>
   Mike Spencer PI reports that the woman told District Judge
Claudia Wilken that she (the clairvoyant) would base her ultimate
decision not solely on evidence and testimony, but also on the
``energy fields'' of witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Sad ending to a potential only-in-the-Bay-Area story: The woman
was not seated on the jury.

NEW TV ADS IN CALIFORNIA FOR BUSH EMPHASIZING EDUCATION
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush is back on television in
California for the first time since March, with a
Republican-sponsored ad touting his record on education.
</P>
<P>
   The ad campaign, backed by the California Republican Party, is
designed to showcase the presidential candidate in the weeks
leading up to the GOP national convention in Philadelphia at the
end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the maximum number of people to see this,'' said state
Sen. Jim Brulte, R-Rancho Cucamonga, the finance chair for the
state GOP. ``We want to set the tone for the convention, where one
of the themes will be improving schools. We know during the summer
months very few voters are paying attention. Now we think people
are starting to focus on the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Brulte refused to say how much the television campaign costs or
where exactly the commercial will run, saying only that the expense
is ``significant.'' There is a version of the ad in Spanish, but
Brulte would not say if it will be aired.
</P>
<P>
   The ad buy is part of an effort by the Republican National
Committee to back Bush with so-called ``soft'' money from the party
rather than ``hard'' dollars from the Texas governor's own campaign
treasury. The single commercial will start running Tuesday in
California and 19 other states.
</P>
<P>
   The ad features a relaxed Bush talking about some of the
education programs he has promoted in Texas. About the only
difference from the flock of campaign ads that will fill the
airwaves in the fall is that the party-sponsored spot doesn't _ and
by federal election law, can't _ end by asking viewers to ``Vote
Bush for President.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy just to spend more,'' Bush says in the ad, repeating
one of his standard campaign themes. ``Now it is time to expect
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Kent Grusendorf, a state representative from Texas, told a news
conference in Sacramento Monday that the commercial emphasizes some
of the areas Bush has pushed in his own state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This personifies what George Bush stands for,'' he said. ``We
have seen minority scores improve more than any state in the
country. Bush ended social promotion and refused to believe that
some kids just couldn't read by the end of third grade.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other improvements Grusendorf said Bush will take from
Texas to the White House if elected are: increased local control,
stricter accountability measures and alternatives for at-risk
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Texas, there has been a 37 percent increase in student
funding and a 37 percent increase in teacher pay,'' Grusendorf
said. ``I'm convinced that if Bush is elected president, he will
work tirelessly to help children receive the best possible
education.''
</P>
<P>
   Brulte said the new television ad campaign shows once again that
Bush is going to fight hard to try to win California, despite
trailing Vice President Al Gore in polls here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats want to win California on the cheap,'' he said.
``They are afraid of this candidacy, they are afraid of this
message. I assure you that when you see the size of this buy and
how widespread it is, you will see that Governor Bush is serious
about California.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is welcome to spend time and money in California, said Bob
Mulholland, a spokesman for the state Democratic Party. But before
election day, he warned, the Texas governor is going to have to
talk about subjects that are much more controversial than
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have Republicans right where we want them,'' Mulholland
said. ``They want to prove California is competitive, but in the
end we will crush them on (abortion) choice and guns.''

 CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS FOOT $1 MILLION TAB FOR S.F. DIRT REMOVAL  &HT;     By GREG LUCAS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ The giant trash company that had to haul away the
lead-tainted dirt that builders of San Francisco's Pacific Bell
Park took to the wrong landfill has persuaded legislators and the
Davis administration to make taxpayers foot the $977,000 bill for
disposal.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists for Waste Management Inc., which had sales of $13
billion in 1999, has said the company was owed the money because
the state first said dirt from the stadium was not hazardous and
then reversed itself. The company was then forced to move the soil
again, this time to a more secure landfill.
</P>
<P>
   Waste Management argued that the state admitted its mistake and
should compensate the company for the costs of that error. But in
April, the state Board of Control rejected Waste Management's
claim, as it routinely does with most big-ticket items.
</P>
<P>
   That same error cost the Giants more than $2 million in
higher-than-expected disposal costs of the tainted dirt left on its
infield. The Giants received no state reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it passed muster,'' said Assemblywoman Carole Migden,
D-San Francisco, who placed the money for Waste Management in this
year's state budget. ``I first tried to ascertain if it was a
legitimate claim, and the Davis administration's view was the claim
was righteous.''
</P>
<P>
   Waste Management is a political backer of Migden's. On February
18, Migden received a $2,000 campaign contribution from the
disposal company.
</P>
<P>
   The money for Waste Management _ slipped into the budget at a
late-night hearing days before the budget was finally approved _ is
probably the last chapter in the saga of the disposal of 18,000
cubic yards of lead-laced dirt by the builders of Pacific Bell
Park.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1999, while the $319 million stadium was under
construction, the state Department of Toxic Substance Control
analyzed a mound of dirt from the site and found it not to be
hazardous.
</P>
<P>
   Some 6,000 cubic yards of the dirt was then hauled to the
Altamont landfill, which is operated by Waste Management.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after the ballpark builders got the go-ahead to dump
the dirt at Altamont, the state reversed itself, saying a more
thorough testing of the dirt proved that it contained high enough
concentrations of lead to be hazardous.
</P>
<P>
   Disposal of hazardous materials is much more rigorous and
requires the use of special landfills.
</P>
<P>
   Alameda County officials, angered that the lead-heavy dirt was
dumped in a municipal landfill, ordered Waste Management to get the
dirt out of Altamont or possibly see its license revoked.
</P>
<P>
   Waste Management was forced to gather up the tainted dirt and
truck it to a hazardous-materials dump it operates in Kettleman
Hills in Kings County.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the company requested reimbursement from the state
for the moving costs, saying the costs would never have been
incurred if it had not been for the state's error. The claim also
included $45,621 in legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   After the state Board of Control rejected the claim, Waste
Management's lobbyists went to work, trying to get the company's
money into the budget.
</P>
<P>
   The company won approval of the idea from Ed Lowry, the new
director of the toxics department, and Winston Hickox, Gov. Gray
Davis' cabinet secretary for environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a legitimate beef with the state,'' Lowry said.
``Before I became director, someone dropped the ball and mistakes
were made.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the company enlisted Migden's help.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was complete agreement,'' said Kent Stoddard, director
of government affairs for Waste Management in Sacramento. ``No one
in the administration was disputing an error was made which put us
in the very costly position of having to remove this waste (from
Altamont).''
</P>
<P>
   The money is buried on Page 332 of the 863-page budget as a
spending item for the Integrated Waste Management Board, which
regulates landfills.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost impossible to tell that the money is for Waste
Management by reading the budget item:
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the amount appropriated in this item, $977,000 shall be
used by the (board) exclusively for the remediation costs described
in the State Board of Control Claims No. G503311, for full
satisfaction and release of that claim.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the number of the Waste Management claim the State Board
of Controls already had rejected.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no attempt by the state to offer compensation to
the Giants, which bore the cost of sending 12,000 cubic yards of
the lead-laced dirt left in the ballpark's infield by train to a
dump in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a small part of the soil was hauled to Altamont. We
incurred costs in excess of $2 million,'' said Jack Bair, the
Giants' vice president and general counsel. ``This latest
development certainly came as a surprise to us.''

DELTA PROMOTER NOW WANTS 8,500 HOMES BUILT BEFORE GIANT
THEME  PARK
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By ELIZABETH BELL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LATHROP, San Joaquin County _ A decade ago, a South African
architect came to this Interstate 5 town and dazzled residents with
visions of ``Califia'' _ an entertainment Mecca grander even than
Epcot Center _ on their very own Delta island.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the 5,800 acres of fertile farmland from which Califia
would spring is still characterized by the same cornfields,
farmworkers, potholes, heat, dust, soupy fog and floods.
</P>
<P>
   But Lathrop residents _ who pine for their own Save-Mart, or
Wal-Mart, or any mart that would save them a trip out of town for
the most basic of errands _ still believe.
</P>
<P>
   They believe in Califia's chief visionary, Norman Jarrett, and
in his plans for four world-class theme parks, three golf courses,
8,500 homes in European-style villages, a sports arena, cultural
arts center, shopping malls and offices.
</P>
<P>
   They believe in Califia despite critics' warnings that Jarrett
will never find backers for his ideas and that Lathrop will wind up
with 8,500 tract homes, freeways clogged with even more Bay Area
commuters and not a roller coaster or new job to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   That won't happen, Jarrett has sworn up and down for a decade.
But now, after struggling to find investors willing to sign on the
dotted line, he wants the city's permission to build the houses
before the theme parks.
</P>
<P>
   The naysayers are all but jumping up and down shouting, ``I told
you so.'' They worry that if the homes come first they will attract
commuters instead of retirees and employees for Califia.
</P>
<P>
   But the faithful still believe and want to accommodate Jarrett
lest they risk losing Califia altogether.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,400 of Lathrop's 3,400 registered voters have signed a
petition to put an initiative on the November ballot letting
Jarrett out of a key clause of the original development deal.
Instead of having to spend $100 million on a theme park before
breaking ground on a single house, they want to allow Jarrett to
build the houses first.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative would require developers to guarantee
``substantially equivalent'' economic development, or pay $5,000
per house into an economic development fund. It would be up the the
City Council to decide what qualifies as ``substantially
equivalent.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the $5,000, Lathrop would get $1,000 per house to use for
economic development. The rest would go to Califia to support
simultaneous commercial development on the island _ known as the
Stewart Tract _ such as business parks or shopping. Thus, Jarrett
said, the new residents would have jobs nearby and would not become
Bay Area commuters.
</P>
<P>
   By bringing in housing first, Jarrett believes the new residents
would help foot the $100 million bill for needed infrastructure,
making the project a more attractive deal for entertainment
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Situated about three miles from the rest of Lathrop, Stewart
Tract has flooded twice in 17 years and would need huge levees,
roads, a sewage treatment plant and potable water before developers
could build anything else.
</P>
<P>
   One of Califia's biggest foes, state Sen. Patrick Johnston,
D-Stockton, believes that Jarrett is leading his followers further
astray. He worries that Jarrett will try to put up thousands of
houses, then pull the plug on the rest of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should the developer be believed? A decade of promises
that a big theme park would come first have vanished because it's a
stupid idea in the first place,'' Johnston said. ``There is no
logical market for a gigantic theme park on a Delta island that is
foggy and wet in the winter and hot and windy in the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Downstream and upstream residents say the levees would cause
their land to flood during heavy rains. County health officials say
the proposed location for the sewage treatment plant could
contaminate drinking water. Farmers say Califia would destroy prime
farmland and sap the Central Valley of desperately needed water.
Environmentalists say the entire project is a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   About 20,000 new homes have been built in San Joaquin and
Stanislaus counties in the past five years, and nearly 40,000
people travel over the Altamont Pass every day for work. Traffic on
Interstate 205 is bumper to bumper every weekday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Tri-Valley area cities are also straining at the flow of traffic
and would oppose any widening of the Altamont Pass to accommodate
Central Valley commuters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would just inundate everything in the Tri-Valley area,''
said Livermore's traffic engineer, Dan Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club has sued, and other groups are poised to do the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett, a seemingly mild-mannered, buttoned-down businessman in
person, comes off as an unlikely crusader for a place of such
exuberance and abandon as an amusement park. He enjoys theme parks,
although he's not one for roller coasters.
</P>
<P>
   What drives him, he said, is his belief that ``master-planned
communities are better than adding to existing cities in a
sprawl-like manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Before bringing his family to the United States in 1986, Jarrett
said, he worked in an architecture firm in South Africa with his
father and had a hand in early planning of a theme park outside
Johannesburg called Gold Reef City. In America, he said, he could
think much bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett's vision for Califia _ named after the queen of a
mythical paradise from 16th century Spanish literature _ has grown
over the years. It all began with an idea for an amusement park
named ``Gold Rush City,'' bringing the Wild West back to life.
</P>
<P>
   Now he talks of a number of amusement parks, with themes like
``Farm World,`' a salute to the Central Valley agriculture
industry; ``Wild Encounter,'' a majestic wildlife park with day and
nighttime safaris; ``Ingenuity,'' celebrating technology; and
``Splash Down,'' a water playground.
</P>
<P>
   His brochure shows a sports complex, three golf courses, a
cultural center drawing world-class performers, houses designed to
look like European villages, fine hotels, and a network of ferries,
airplanes and trains shuttling people to Califia.
</P>
<P>
   It appears as inappropriate in the hot Central Valley _ where
water wars dominate local politics _ as modern-day Las Vegas might
have once sounded.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not his dream will ever be built, Jarrett has enough
financial backing and government support to convince his supporters
that he is credible.
</P>
<P>
   He has already persuaded Lathrop to annex 5,800 acres and sign a
development agreement. Backed by Somerset Homes, a subsidiary of a
British land investment company, Jarrett has sunk $20 million into
the plan. And Somerset Homes' president, Allan Chapman, has a track
record. He won approval for 11,000 homes now under construction
near San Ramon.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the market for theme parks is good. U.S. park revenues
have steadily grown by about 6 percent a year for the past 20
years, according to the International Association of Amusement
Parks and Attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Theme park operators like Six Flags are capitalizing on the
demand by taking over inefficient parks such as Vallejo's Marine
World and revamping them. Disney is set to open a new theme park in
Anaheim next year, and Seagram just opened a new park in Florida.
Jarrett contends that Northern California is underserved by
amusement parks.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison Price, a Palm Springs consultant for entertainment
attractions who helped plan Disneyland in 1953, said he agrees
there is a market for a theme park in the Central Valley, although
he isn't sure it is big enough to accommodate the scale Jarrett
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Before coming to the largely industrial town of Lathrop, Jarrett
tried to sell his big dreams in Stockton, Richmond and Vacaville.
Only Lathrop bit.
</P>
<P>
   Situated near the intersection of Interstates 5 and 205, Lathrop
is home to glass and fertilizer plants, a grocery distribution
warehouse and an Army depot, but unemployment remains relatively
high, as it does throughout most of the San Joaquin Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Lathrop residents want the niceties of urban life and believe
that the tax revenues and demand created by hordes of people
flocking to Califia could deliver them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to shop in our own town, in our own city,'' said Benny
Gatto, a former mayor who is leading the drive to allow Califia to
build houses first. ``We don't have a library, we don't have a
bank, we have one doctor, we don't have a barber shop, we don't
have a grocery store except the small little mom and pop.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Jarrett predicted that he would open the first
theme park in 2001, although that now appears impossible. But he
isn't fazed by his results so far and says it would be reasonable
to spend 20 years getting a project of this magnitude off the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any doubts whatsoever,'' said Jarrett. ``I don't
panic easily; otherwise, I would probably not be doing what I'm
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lathrop Mayor Steve McKee may be the biggest skeptic on the City
Council, and he still believes it's all possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have supported this project for 10 years, and I have sold it
and I have preached it and I have enthusiastically embraced it,''
said McKee. McKee, however, isn't keen on allowing the housing
before he sees some big investors commit to the Califia dream.
(Jarrett said he has many interested investors, but they wish to
remain anonymous.)
</P>
<P>
   Many Lathrop residents, however, appear willing to give Jarrett
the benefit of the doubt. Nearly every day, residents of Lathrop
and surrounding towns stop by the Califia offices housed in a
former outlet store on the edge of I-5 to see the plans for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   By the time they've wound their way through an exhibit with
pictures of beaming people enjoying themselves in other theme
parks, most have joined the ranks of the believers.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving, they record their testimonials in a guest
comment book: ``I can't wait to see it live!'' and ``Wow! Hope it's
here soon!'' and ``Thanks to those who dare to dream!''

<P>
   Test scores in reading, math and grammar once again inched
upward for most California students, a victory that carries the
promise of cash awards for many schools and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Results released Monday on the third annual Stanford 9 exam show
that, statewide, math scores rose an average of 8 points, grammar
skills 5 points, reading 3 points and spelling 7 points. Most
scores hover at or below the 50th percentile, which is the national
average.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Bay Area, scores showed similar upward trends.
The greatest gains were seen in elementary grades, where the state
has concentrated efforts to train teachers and lower class sizes.
</P>
<P>
   The exception was in the Oakland district, where students with
limited English skills were included in the testing for the first
time. Scores remained flat or dropped slightly at most grade
levels, prompting the district's new superintendent to order
remedial classes for low-performers.
</P>
<P>
   About 4.4 million California public school students in grades 2
through 11 took the multiple-choice test in the spring. Only
students in grades two through eight took the spelling test, while
only upper grades took science and social studies exams. The scores
include results for each school, district and county, as well as
statewide averages.
</P>
<P>
   `We've seen real, solid gains across every grade and subject,''
said state Superintendent Delaine Eastin, who announced the results
Monday in Sacramento. ``Some grades are better than others (but)
our investment is paying dividends.''
</P>
<P>
   That is literally true. Depending on the rate of improvement,
schools will for the first time be awarded $150 per pupil.
Teachers, too, will see awards as high as $25,000 if growth is
steep enough. The winners will be announced in November.
</P>
<P>
   The rewards will come from a pool of $677 million dollars set
aside to encourage improvement. That is far more than the cost of
the test itself, $40.6 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have challenged our schools, and our schools are rising to
the challenge,'' said Gov. Gray Davis who has steered much of the
state's budget surplus into the schools. ``But we can't afford to
rest on our laurels. We have to keep improving.''
</P>
<P>
   Although scores rose overall this year, reading performance
plunged after eighth grade and remained low throughout high school,
a trend that has continued for three years. This year, the score
dropped from 47 to 36.
</P>
<P>
   That trend also played out in many Bay Area schools, even
affluent ones that typically perform well.
</P>
<P>
   At San Ramon Valley schools, for example, eighth-graders scored
77, while ninth-graders scored 63.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our kids don't suddenly get dumb after eighth grade,'' said
Eastin, noting the drop also occurs on the Stanford 9 test in other
states. She blamed the problem on the test publisher, Harcourt
Educational Measurement of Texas and said other state schools
chiefs also believe there is something wrong with the questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just stuff and nonsense,'' responded Bob Rayborn,
Harcourt's spokesman in California. ``Ninth grade is the first year
where it's unusual to find specific courses in reading. They're
reading to learn instead of learning to read. We also know there
are larger numbers of non-English speakers in grade nine.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stanford 9 is designed to compare yearly scores against a
large national sample collected some years ago, which means the
test questions are identical each year. This has led to criticism
that gains are largely due to teachers' familiarity with the test
and their improved ability to teach to its specific content.
</P>
<P>
   Education experts have also complained that the Stanford 9 does
not test students on California's academic standards. And, as a
multiple-choice test, it fails to inspire students to think
critically or test writing skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to write anything, so teachers focus on how to
identify bad sentences in a paragraph,'' said Mike Kirst, a
Stanford University education professor. ``I don't call that
teaching to the test, but you're narrowing the focus of instruction
to what's being tested on the test.''
</P>
<P>
   Eastin said she expects that an actual writing section will be
added next year. She also said that within two years, there will be
more questions that match the state's academic standards. Those
will be given increasing importance when it comes to judging which
schools have earned finanical rewards, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is not a multiple-choice exam,'' Eastin said. ``We do not
know if our children can write and problem solve.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the improved scores pleased educators around the
state, who praised the state for spending money on teacher training
and smaller class sizes.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, high scores were most evident in wealthier school
districts. Some great leaps were seen in lower-scoring districts _
although occasionally the percentage of eligible students who took
the test was low enough to raise suspicions that weaker students
had been sent on a field trip on testing day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it's not true,'' said Ritu Khanna, San Francisco's
testing director. ``It's very hard to (manipulate) scores.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Khanna plans to send a letter asking for an
explanation at schools with at least a 10 percent drop in the ratio
of students taking the test. One such school was Balboa High, where
81 percent of eligible students took the test in 1999, but only 67
percent took it this spring.
</P>
<P>
   In order for any high school to earn a reward, at least 90
percent of eligible pupils must take the test. In the lower grades,
the figure is 95 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The money is not intended to simply reward high-scoring schools,
but those that make great improvements. Some low performers in San
Francisco did leap forward _ including Harte, King and Malcolm X
elementaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so happy about those schools and how they've improved,''
Khanna said.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Bay Area districts, the economically and culturally
diverse Mount Diablo spent the last year reworking its curriculum
and materials trying to make sure students were covering state
standards by grade level, said Superintentent Gary McHenry. It also
revamped after-school and summer school programs for struggling
students.
</P>
<P>
   In that district scores generally rose by up to 4 points each of
the last three school years, though in some cases they remained the
same.
</P>
<P>
   In Oakland, three-fourths of students read below the national
average for their age, and two-thirds scored below average in math.
Hoping to reverse the trend Superintendent Dennis Chaconas said
Monday he will require all middle and high schoolers who scored
below 36 to enroll in new math and reading classes in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the district purposely didn't test nearly 9,000
students still learning English, arguing that to do so would skew
the district test results and traumatize the students.
</P>
<P>
   The Redwood City school district this year also tested more
limited English speakers, about 700 in all, said Superintendent
Ronald Crates. Many parents wanted their children to be excused
from the test, he said, but the district urged them to participate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our work has been paying off,'' Crates said. ``Even with more
tested who are basically not fluent in English, the district has
improved'' in reading, math and grammar.
</P>
<P>
   Crates attributes the rise to a new program that provides
tutoring and after-school help to every child who scored below 25.

WELLPOINT GETS 10-POINT BOOST FROM ANALYST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS SIEROTY

<TEXT>
<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. _ Shares of WellPoint Health Networks Inc.
gained almost 10 percent Monday after a Wall Street analyst
upgraded the company's stock in a second-quarter earnings preview.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman Brothers analyst Larry Marsh raised WellPoint to a
``buy'' from ``outperform'' and elevated his price target on the
stock to $95 from $90 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Marsh cited WellPoint's solid market positioning, his belief
that the company will exceed its $1.22 earnings estimate and the
anticipated closing of WellPoint's merger with Cerulean Companies
Inc. by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   WellPoint will report second-quarter earnings July27.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lehman analyst must feel that the fundamentals of our
business are good and that we are meeting our customers' needs,''
said John Cygul, a spokesman with Thousand Oaks-based WellPoint.
</P>
<P>
   WellPoint announced two years ago that it would merge with
Cerulean in a transaction valued at approximately $500 million.
Cerulean operates as Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Georgia with more
than 1.7 million members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have noted further evidence that this well-managed company
continues to enjoy very solid positioning in its markets,'' wrote
Marsh in his report.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a 12 percent growth in commercial California membership
in the first quarter of 2000, we estimate that the company's market
share is now in excess of 17 percent in large group and 25 percent
in small group and individuals,'' he said. ``This growth has come
while increasing margins slightly.''
</P>
<P>
   WellPoint has also benefited from not having to deal with a
large exposure to the Medicare market, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``WellPoint's Medicare membership is currently less than 3
percent of total membership, and an estimated 7 percent of
revenues, representing one of the lowest percentages in the
industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of WellPoint gained $7.438, or 9.9 percent, to close
Monday at $82.875 on heavy volume of 1,246,800 shares on the New
York Stock Exchange.

GLOVER SIZZLES TO VICTORY IN HURDLES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ When Sandra Glover graduated from the University of
Houston in 1991, she became an elementary school teacher and her
hurdling career seemed destined for anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   After two Olympic trials in which she never threatened to make
the American team, however, Glover ran the fastest time in the
world this year in the 400-meter hurdles on Monday night, winning
in 53.33 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing fifth at the 1999 world championships, she now
becomes a favorite to win the gold medal at the 2000 Summer
Olympics in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   In the men's long jump, with the four-time Olympic champion Carl
Lewis and the world record-holder Mike Powell retired, the event
has slumped into mediocrity. Melvin Lister won on Monday night with
a jump of 27 feet 3} inches, the shortest winning jump at the
Olympic trials since 1980. Lister's jump was the only 27-foot
effort of the night. Dwight Phillips took second at 26-8{ and
Walter Davis finished third at in 26-7\.
</P>
<P>
   A day after winning the women's 1,500 meters, Regina Jacobs was
the top qualifier in the 5,000-meters preliminaries on Monday night
in 15 minutes 36.09 seconds. She has said that she used the 5,000
only for a training run and will not contest the event in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   In the women's 400-meter hurdles, Glover started in Lane 7, not
generally a prime lane, but she took control of the race on the
final curve. Her winning time was a full two-tenths of a second
ahead of the previous world best of 53.53 this year, held by the
current world champion, Nezha Bidouane of Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   Glover defeated the world record-holder, Kim Batten, who was
second in 54.70, and Tonja Buford-Bailey, who was third in 54.80.
Glover's victory was more remarkable considering that she is
coached by her husband, Don, who is a chemical engineer for
Phillips Petroleum. When he began coaching his wife six years ago,
he knew nothing about the event. By last year, however, Sandra
Glover had become the national champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do it at 22 or 23, but I'm here and I'm grateful,''
she said. ``Thirty-one years old and running strong.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Glover has taken a leave from her teaching job. She
and her husband train after he gets off work in the evening. He
will also take a leave to prepare for Sydney, he said, adding, ``I
hope I have a job when I get back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a full-time job and was training at the same time,''
Sandra Glover said. ``It was hard. After working eight hours with
4- and 5-year-olds, it was tough. ``
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference tonight, she then looked at Batten, whose
world record is 52.61 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry, Kim,'' Glover said, ``but your record is going down
this year.'' &QL;

ANGELS BREATHE SIGH OF RELIEF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Brian Cooper was credited with the victory in the
Anaheim Angels' 3-2 win over the San Diego Padres on Monday night
before 19,930 at Qualcomm Stadium. But he couldn't have done it
without a little help from his friends.
</P>
<P>
   Four relievers _ Mark Petkovsek, Mike Holtz, Shigetoshi Hasegawa
and Troy Percival _ combined for the final 2 innings to save it for
Cooper (4-3), who allowed two runs and four hits in 6 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper was good, but the bullpen was perfect. The foursome
retired all eight batters they faced, including three by strikeout.
Percival pitched the ninth and rebounded from his blown save Sunday
to earn hit 22nd save of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels managed just enough offense off Padres starter Matt
Clement. Mo Vaughn had an RBI double in the first inning to score
Darin Erstad (2 for 4), and reserve catcher Matt Walbeck had a
two-run homer in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   It was enough, just barely. The Angels didn't have a baserunner
after Erstad singled to lead off the fifth inning. The final 15
Angels batters were retired in order.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad led off the game with a double into the right-field
corner. After Kevin Stocker sacrificed Erstad to third, Vaughn
drove him in with a double to left-center.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres matched the Angels' run in the bottom of the first
after Al Martin tripled and scored on Ryan Klesko's single.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels took a 3-1 lead in the fourth when Adam Kennedy
singled with two out and scored on Walbeck's fourth homer of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cooper settled into a groove. Following a two-out
walk to Bret Boone in the first inning, Cooper retired 10 in a row.
The streak ended when Kory DeHaan led off the fifth with a walk.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper rarely hits 90 mph on the radar gun, but he threw one of
the Angels' two complete-game shutouts this season on June 30
against Oakland. (Scott Schoeneweis has the other.) He started the
season in the minors but was called up May 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like his makeup on the mound,'' Angels manager Mike
Scioscia said. ``He has an idea what he wants to do. He's fearless
out there. If somebody digs out a sinker for a base hit, he's not
afraid to throw it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``When guys like that show that kind of makeup, they're ready
for the challenge. You don't know if they'll be successful, but
they're ready for the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper faced a challenge in the sixth inning after Klesko's
one-out double. Phil Nevin followed with an RBI single to center,
but Boone flied to right for the second out, Wiki Gonzalez grounded
out to third and the Angels still held a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper batted for himself in the top of the seventh, grounding
out, but ran out of gas in the bottom of the inning. He walked the
No. 8 hitter, Kevin Nicholson, with one out, then walked
pinch-hitter Dave Magadan and was replaced by reliever Petkovsek.
</P>
<P>
   Petkovsek got Eric Owens on a liner to third for the second out,
before Scioscia went to his bullpen again. Holtz entered the game
and faced Joe Vitiello, who ended the inning when he grounded into
a force play.

BROKEN RIGHT THUMB PUTS HUNDLEY ON DL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ Todd Hundley's injury-marred season took another
hit Monday when the Los Angeles Dodgers catcher was placed on the
15-day disabled list with a broken right thumb.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley could be back in less than a week since the DL is
retroactive to July 9, when he took a foul tip off the thumb in
Seattle. Hundley, who also missed a month with a strained rib-cage
muscle, aggravated the thumb throwing before Sunday's series opener
against Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pain was tremendous,'' said Hundley, whose thumb is
wrapped but not in a cast. ``I could not grip the ball. Hitting is
fine, but throwing is impossible. I could have come down from the
side, but that didn't help the throws. We're fortunate that we have
good depth at catcher. Chad (Kreuter) has been great all year and
Paul (LoDuca) has been outstanding when he's been in there.''
</P>
<P>
   LoDuca, who will catch former Albuquerque teammate Mike Judd
today, is batting just .214, but he has called good games, thrown
out baserunners and added a spark. But there is no substitute for
Hundley's offense. He has played just 46 of the Dodgers' 91 games
but has 17 homers, 43 RBI and a 316 average.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think he will be fine in a week, but this is something that
had to be done,'' said dugout coach Jim Tracy, who is serving as
manager while Davey Johnson is out with an irregular heartbeat.
``It's tough not having his bat in there, but with 70-odd games
left, we need to make sure he is 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Brown will start: Kevin Brown tested his tender right
shoulder by throwing for 15 minutes off a bullpen mound before
Monday's game and declared himself ready to start Wednesday against
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on,'' said Brown, who left Saturday's start with a
slight muscle strain in his shoulder. ``Now, we'll see if I am on.
I did not feel any discomfort in the area that gave me trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's workout session actually lasted 25 minutes with time out
to evaluate his performance with pitching coach Claude Osteen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is such a perfectionist, we went over a bunch of different
things. That is one of the things that makes him so special. Most
guys will just go out to the bullpen and see how hard they can
throw it. When they reach a certain number they're done. Brownie is
different. He makes sure all his pitches are working the way he
wants them before he is ready to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   __ A start for Judd: Judd, the one-time top prospect, is
replacing left-hander Carlos Perez, who began serving a five-game
suspension on Sunday for his involvement in the May 16 Wrigley
Field brawl.
</P>
<P>
   Judd, 25, once was considered such a valuable member of the
organization he was protected during the 1997 expansion draft after
making just 12 starts above Single-A. Injuries and inconsistency
stalled his progress and he now is in his third season splitting
time between Triple-A Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it is just one start and then I go back,'' said Judd,
4-4 with a 4.74 ERA in 16 starts for the Dukes. ``I feel I've been
pitching well, especially lately. It is always good to be here and
show what I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Quick hits: Not surprisingly, Gary Sheffield was named
National League Player of the Week after batting .412 (5 for 12)
with four homers and six RBI. Sheffield homered in three
consecutive games, including his 30th on Friday, the fastest player
to reach that total in L.A. Dodger history. He also had a .588
on-base percentage. . . . The Dodgers have a decision to make after
Judd is returned to the minors. Utility player F.P. Santangelo
begins his five-day suspension Friday, meaning they could bring up
a position player or activate Gregg Olson, who has made just two
appearances all season because of a right-forearm strain. . . .
Brian Giles' third-inning homer off Darren Dreifort was the 100th
of his career.

COTTON SEARCHING FOR HOOP HOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SEAN KEARNS  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Finding a basketball home has never come
easy for Schea Cotton, and in his first three weeks as a
professional basketball player that hasn't changed.
</P>
<P>
   Cotton went from a second-round hopeful to not being drafted. He
played one game for an agent team at the Summer Pro League.
</P>
<P>
   He later was picked up by the Orlando Magic summer-league team.
But the untimely death of Conrad McRae during practice last week
ended the Magic's summer season.
</P>
<P>
   Then Cotton played his first game Monday as a member of the
Golden State Warriors' summer team.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed that every college recruited Cotton out of St. John
Bosco High, including UCLA. He played one season at Alabama before
declaring for the NBA draft. But he wasn't selected.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the Magic summer team, Cotton was becoming
friends with McRae. Toward the end of the Magic's first practice,
Cotton saw McRae fall face first. At first, Cotton thought McRae
was playing some kind of joke. About three hours after McRae's
death, the Magic had a team meeting and disbanded the summer-league
team.
</P>
<P>
   Cotton was once again without a team until the Warriors picked
him up.

COUNTY SUPERVISORS TO VOTE ON CONVENTION FUNDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY ANDERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Boosting the bill taxpayers will have to pay for
the Democratic National Convention, the county Board of Supervisors
will vote Tuesday on a motion to spend an additional $1.59 million
to help the Los Angeles Police Department and convention planners.
</P>
<P>
   About one-third of the money would pay for buses for convention
delegates, with the rest being used to pay for overtime for
deputies to provide security on the buses and respond to LAPD
requests for help during the Aug. 14-17 convention.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by the supervisors, more than $1 million would be
spent to pay overtime to 300 sheriff's deputies to protect
delegates as they ride tour buses to and from their hotels
throughout the county, said sheriff's Capt. Michael Kenyon.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the funds would pay for 100 to 200 support personnel and
as many field booking teams as needed to transport people to jail
after mass arrests.
</P>
<P>
   About $500,000 would go to the Los Angeles Convention and
Visitors Bureau to charter 286 tour buses on 38 different routes.
</P>
<P>
   If the LAPD responds in full force to quell as many as 50,000
protesters expected during the convention, the extra $1.59 million
could bring the total local law enforcement tab to more than $11
million, said taxpayer advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've created a monster with this convention,'' said Kris
Vosburgh, executive director of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers
Association. ``It's getting to the point where taxpayers would be
better off if we would pay the Democrats to go away.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear how the supervisors will vote on the issue. While
the board's two Republican members are opposed, three of the five
supervisors are Democrats _ Gloria Molina, Zev Yaroslavsky and
Yvonne Brathwaite Burke. But Yaroslavsky and Burke did not return
phone calls seeking comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In a March 14 letter, Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C. Parks
requested Sheriff Lee Baca's help in the event of ``major civil
unrest.''
</P>
<P>
   Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Molina added the motion to
Tuesday's agenda late Friday to pay the $1.59 million at Baca's
request.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sheriff Baca is particularly concerned about the incidents
that occurred after the Lakers (NBA championship victory) game and
the World Trade Conference in Seattle so that the county is
prepared for whatever may occur,'' said Miguel Santana, Molina's
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traffic downtown is especially bad right now. And to minimize
that impact, they felt it would be helpful to provide $500,000 to
the Los Angeles city Convention and Visitors Bureau to provide
transportation to the convention,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   LAPD Lt. Horace Frank said Parks did not request the use of
private security guards, who might have cost less, because ``we are
talking about the security of our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank said armed sheriff's deputies will be needed for ``an
event as historic as this, where you will have the president and
vice president of the United States and not to mention hundreds of
delegates.''
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich called Molina's motion an
attempt to ``steamroll $1.586 million ... to the Democrat
convention.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This left-wing maneuver _ breaking county policy of private
organizations paying their own way _ is reckless,'' Antonovich
said. ``The Tournament of Roses Parade contracts with the county
and pays for sheriff's services. It brings in hundreds of thousands
of people and creates a greater boost to the county treasury than
the convention will.''
</P>
<P>
   Knabe said he intends to introduce a motion Tuesday that would
require the city of Los Angeles to reimburse the county for the
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't support the $500,000 for the visitors bureau,'' Knabe
said. ``As it relates to the Sheriff's Department, I don't mind
setting aside some money if there is a way for us to get
reimbursed.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jimenez, spokesman for the visitors bureau, said the
$500,000 will cover the gap between the $2 million the city paid to
provide shuttle service for delegates and the $2.6 million price.
</P>
<P>
   He said delegates will be staying in 79 different hotels
throughout the county and that 26 percent will be at hotels outside
the city of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because those locations in Los Angeles County are farther away
from the Staples Center, that 26 percent is about 40percent of the
cost,'' Jimenez said. ``The people staying outside the city
constitute about $1 million in cost. So what the county is
providing is about half of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Vosburgh said the county was drawn into the fray by the
``ill-considered decisions of the city,'' which agreed with the DNC
officials to pay for police protection services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The additional money for the sheriff's deputies can be
justified somewhat because obviously the convention and associated
activities have the potential to put lives and property at risk,''
he said. ``I think where we firmly draw the line is in providing an
additional half-million dollars to the visitors bureau.
</P>

   ``Why this rush to subsidize the activities of a private
political party? The city first promises to host the convention at
no expense, solicits the Democrats to come here, breaks its
promises to city residents and then subsidizes the convention with
an additional $4 million over and above the costs of additional
security measures,'' Vosburgh said.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Austin, spokesman for L.A. Convention 2000, said it's normal
for government entities outside the host city to pay for political
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   He said the city of Philadelphia, where the Republican National
Convention will be held July 31-Aug. 3, is paying $14 million for
the event, and that the state of Pennsylvania is spending $7
million for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The neighboring state of New Jersey is paying $3 million,'' he
said. ``New Jersey isn't kicking in $3 million to a city in a
neighboring state because nice people live in that city, but
because it's an extremely good investment. That's why this
convention is a great investment for the citizens of Los Angeles,
as well as the citizens of Los Angeles County.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Stephen Yagman, who last Friday went to federal court
and asked for an injunction to force the return of funds the city
paid for the convention, said he intends to ask his clients _ a
group of city taxpayers _ what they intend to do about this latest
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is that gifts of public funds are being made for
private purposes,'' Yagman said. ``The group I represent believes
that to be both unconstitutional and wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anybody who votes for something like that is corrupt.
What's shocking is that the people at the city who did this and
what the county may do seem to have no shame.''

BIG NIGHT FOR DREIFORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Davey Johnson didn't have cable TV in his hospital
room, but no doubt he had Darren Dreifort on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers manager spent a second night Monday
undergoing treatment for an irregular heartbeat and through his
doctors learned his erratic right-hander withstood a sloppy start
to defeat the Pittsburgh Pirates 9-6 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was eager to be with the crowd of 25,261 and is expected
to be back in uniform by the end of the homestand. More
importantly,Dreifort retired 11 of the final 12 Pirates he faced to
win for just the second time since May 12.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Terry Adams didn't make it easy, allowing three runs in
the eighth inning after taking over for Dreifort, including a
two-run homer by Kevin Young.
</P>
<P>
   But Gary Sheffield countered with a two-run homer of his own in
the bottom of the eighth, giving the Dodgers (47-44) their
second-straight victory under interim manager Jim Tracy and keeping
them five games back of division-leading Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just keeping the seat warm,'' said Tracy, who managed
seven years in the minors for the Montreal organization. ``Nothing
go Davey being gone. I have learned so much from him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tracy's troops took it to the Pirates, who started
right-hander Bronson Arroyo (0-2, 9.33 ERA). Make that 0-3.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Elster had a two-run double in the second and Jim Leyritz
added a two-run single in the seventh that blew the game open. St
right-fielder Shawn Green even brought the crowd to its feet when
he was thrown out trying to stretch a third-inning triple into an
inside-the-park home run.
</P>
<P>
   But this night belonged to Dreifort (5-7), who even drove in the
eventual winning run when he was struck on the left toe by a pitch
from left-hander Chris Peters with the bases loaded in the sixth.
It scored Eric Karros, who reached on an error by shortstop Pat
Meares.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort allowed four hits and three runs in seven innings,
walked just two and struck out eight.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort entered the game winless in his past six starts after
pitching a two-hit shutout more than two months ago against the fi
Cardinals in St. Louis. But he followed it by allowing six runs in
just 4 innings against the lowly Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   In that game Dreifort also tweaked his right knee sliding. After
beginning the season 3-1 with a 2.59 ERA, he entered Monday's game
1-6 with a 7.03 ERA in his next 10 starts.
</P>
<P>
   High pitch counts have hurt and Monday was no different. He
threw 96 through the first six innings and was gone after seven
even though he blew through the Pirates at the end.
</P>
<P>
   But at least he had a lead.
</P>
<P>
   After walking the last four batters he faced July 5 at San
Diego, Dreifort walked the first two Pirates. When he retired No. 3
hitter Wil Cordero on a fielder's choice, a mock cheer went up in
the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But the boos returned when Brian Giles followed with an RBI
double to right.
</P>
<P>
   When the Dodgers scored three runs in the second, Dreifort
performed another old trick _ giving back the lead. Giles tied the
game in the third on a two-run homer to left-center.
</P>
<P>
   Although Johnson pleaded with the Dodgers to let him return to
the field, team internist Michael Mellman insisted the manager
remain under observation a second night at Centinela Hospital
Medical Center in Inglewood.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson takes medication for high blood pressure and missed one
game in 1996 with an irregular heart beat when he managed
Baltimore. He successfully underwent a second day of tests Monday
and was examined by cardiologist Phillip Frankel.
</P>
<P>
   Mellman, however, said Johnson probably would not return to the
club until the end of the home stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wishes and Davey's wishes are somewhat different,'' Mellman
said with a smile. ``He is very anxious to leave. I have to block
his door.''

LAPD ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN PLANNED TO DRAW HUNDREDS OF RECRUITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS: Staff Writer Jason Kandel contributed to this story) 
 
 
By BRENT HOPKINS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Police Department unveiled a new
advertising campaign Monday to recruit hundreds of people in a bid
to expand the force to a full complement of 9,900 officers.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign includes radio and television ads and a $500,000
budget to buy air time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no mystery that we're 600 officers short,'' Chief Bernard
Parks said at a news conference at Parker Center.
</P>
<P>
   Although the department has hired about 5,000 officers during
the last five years, it also loses hundreds annually through
resignations, retirements and other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The number of new hires has fallen recently, which Parks
attributed to a strong economy luring away candidates who would
normally apply.
</P>
<P>
   To reverse the trend, the new series of four, 30-second TV ads
and a 60-second radio spot is designed to encourage applicants to
try out for the force. The TV ads will be used on broadcast and
cable outlets, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The ads, which feature five LAPD officers selected from units
across the city, stress community-service aspects of police work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recruitment department tried to pick out some officers ...
who were less `chase-'em-and-grab-'em,' '' said Sgt. Bill Frio,
officer in charge of the LAPD's video recruitment program.
</P>
<P>
   Each TV ad portrays an officer speaking casually about his field
work.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Vince Delg'innocenti of the Hollywood Division described
how he helped a teen-age girl on the street.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Brian Hospidar of Internal Affairs told of his work with a
domestic abuse victim.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Gina Brooks of the Pacific Division and Officer Alma
Skefich of the Harbor Division discussed human-centered aspects of
policing.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said the ads are not an attempt to rehabilitate the
department's reputation amid the Rampart scandal. The ads simply
depict the bulk of the LAPD's duties, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to remake the department's image, we're
trying to recruit officers for what they've always done,'' Parks
said.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign's approach marks a change from past recruitment
efforts, which emphasized action and excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, some of our past videos focused more on
enforcement than community work, which is 95 percent of the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials say many police departments face difficulty in hiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a global problem,'' said LAPD Cmdr. Valentino P.
Paniccia, assistant commanding officer of Operations-Valley Bureau.
``People would rather make $30,000 a year flipping burgers than
getting shot at.''

GLOVER RACES TO HEAD OF CLASS

<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Sydney, say g'day to America's fastest schoolmarm.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Glover won the women's 400-meter hurdles Monday to stamp
herself the favorite in the event in the upcoming Summer Games. A
late-bloomer at 31, Glover defeated world-record holder Kim Batten
with a time of 53.33 seconds in the U.S. Olympic Track and Field
Trials at Sacramento State.
</P>
<P>
   After thanking God repeatedly for giving her the strength to win
in a personal-best time, Glover blurted, ``Sorry, Kim, but your
record is going down this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Batten, somewhat taken aback, said: ``I've had it for six years.
I'd like to see somebody take it down. Go for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Seilala Sua won a battle of UCLA Bruins in the women's discus by
defeating Suzy Powell. Sua threw 216 feet, 2 inches and Powell
threw 211-10. Kristin Kuehl qualified third at 202-7.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin Lister won a lackluster long-jump competition with the
only 27-foot leap.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1999, Glover trained under her husband's tutelage when she
wasn't teaching school in Houston. She taught preschool for three
years and second grade for two more. After a breakthrough year in
1999, she was able to put teaching on hold indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Glover will be absent from class, at least until after the
Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   Tonja Buford-Bailey rallied to finish third. She and Batten have
the two fastest times in history (52.61 and 52.62, in 1995), and
they won bronze and silver, respectively, at the 1996 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Batten took off the 1999 season to nurse a toe injury.
Buford-Bailey missed two years to be a full-time mother to her
20-month-old child. Both expect to be sharper for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Lister led long-jump qualifying with a leap of 27-3 inches. No
one else managed 27 feet in an event dominated for decades by Yanks
such as Bob Beamon, Carl Lewis and Mike Powell. Now, Cuba is the
long-jump power, with Ivan Pedroso the most prominent of the lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm the one to beat'' at Sydney, Lister said. ``I know
I can beat Pedroso. I'm a good jumper just waiting to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Lister, fourth at the NCAA meet for Arkansas last spring,
finished ahead of Dwight Phillips (26-8) and Barton (Kan.)
Community College student Walter Davis (26-7), who was only two
inches and change over the Olympic qualifying standard.
</P>
<P>
   The trio easily is the youngest and most anonymous group of
American long jumpers ever sent to an Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Howard was an angry fourth after claiming his best jump
was improperly measured by officials, who then raked the landing
pit before he could appeal. ``It cost me second place,'' Howard
said. As a replay was shown he said, ``Look America, there's the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   In other events Monday:
</P>
<P>
   __ Lynda Blutreich won the women's javelin competition with a
throw of 191-2, gaining the only guaranteed U.S. berth at the
Sydney Games. None of the top three finishers met the Olympic
qualifying standard of 196-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sport is kind of looked down upon and we don't get much
respect,'' said Blutreich, who went to North Carolina on a softball
scholarship. ``You have to earn respect, too, and I hope the crop
of throwers coming up can push the sport along.''
</P>
<P>
   Runners-up Kim Kreiner and Emily Carlsten have until Sept. 11 to
meet the qualifying standard.
</P>
<P>
   __ Elizabeth Jackson set an American record in the women's
3,000-meter steeplechase, and the memory of that will have to keep
her warm during the Sydney Games, because the steeplechase is one
of the few track events the women don't run in the Olympics.
Jackson's time was 9:57.20.
</P>
<P>
   __ American record-holder Bob Kennedy qualified for the final of
the 5,000-meter run. Kennedy skipped the 10,000 on Friday because
of lingering injuries.
</P>
<P>
   __ Women's 1,500-meter winner Regina Jacobs advanced to the
5,000 final with the best qualifying time, 15 minutes, 36 seconds.
Also qualifying was 10,000-meter winner Deena Drossin of Agoura, at
15:37.52.
</P>
<P>
   Marla Runyon, the legally blind runner who qualified in the
1,500 on Sunday, was entered in the 5,000 but chose not to run.
</P>
<P>
   No competition is scheduled today or Wednesday. Activity resumes
Thursday morning, with the first events of the decathlon.

MARINERS SNAKE-BIT BY ARIZONA ROOKIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The good news for the Mariners is that interleague
play ends Tuesday night, and they've been able to maintain most of
their lead in the AL West while having to play without major-league
RBIs leader Edgar Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona rookie Geraldo Guzman managed to get sneak the baseball
from his hand to catcher Damian Miller's glove without too much
interference from Mariner bats Monday night in pitching the
Diamondbacks to a 7-0 win.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners' first five games after the All-Star break have
been on the road in National League parks, where the designated
hitter is believed to be as barbaric as the Inquisition.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, where the DH is something akin to motherhood and
apple pie in the form of Martinez, it's tough to go cold turkey. In
these first five games, three of which have been losses, the
Mariners are hitting just .226. The Mariners had just five hits,
only four off Guzman in eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners need Martinez. And Martinez needs to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really wanting this stretch to be over,'' Martinez said
after grounding out as a pinch-hitter in the ninth inning. That was
just his third at-bat in these five games. He's hoping to get three
at-bats in five innings Tuesday night against Arizona left-handed
starter Brian Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``A week is a long time to sit out,'' Martinez said. ``I want to
play, not sit. ``It's been a long week. But now it's over. Now I
can go out and play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, who have the same three-game lead in the West that
they had at the All-Star break, are delighted to be getting him
back. They'd like to have both Martinez and injured shortstop Alex
Rodriguez both back, but if they can only get one at a time,
they'll take it. Rodriguez isn't eligible to come off the DL until
July 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, we've missed both of those guys,'' center fielder Mike
Cameron said. ``Getting Edgar back will be a very big help. We'd
like to have Alex, too, but that's not going to happen right now.''
</P>
<P>
   With Martinez returning, the expectation is that the Mariners
will somehow automatically become a better offensive team. That
could happen, but it won't be just because of Martinez. If the rest
of the lineup doesn't hit, Martinez won't be able to shoulder the
load alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing in NL parks was fun for a while, but it's going to be
great to have Edgar back,'' manager Lou Piniella said. ``We keep
talking about Alex and Edgar, and we do need them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth of it is, though, that we need a few of these other
guys to hit, too. That's the reality of the situation. You need to
distribute your offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Guzman, the Mariners did no such thing. John Mabry, in
his third straight start, had two hits. Starting pitcher John
Halama had his first hit of the season, and that was the end of the
offense for Seattle for seven innings. David Bell singled in the
eighth. With Greg Swindell finishing up for Guzman, Jay Buhner
doubled in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guzman did a nice job,'' left fielder Rickey Henderson said.
``He had a nice cutter and worked the outside of the plate. But
we've got to hit better. It will be great to have Edgar back. He's
a big part of the offense. But we've all got to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Guzman, mostly unknown except to baseball insiders, was making
just his second big-league start. It only seemed as if he'd been
doing this all his life. In his major-league debut against Houston
on July 6, Guzman gave up four hits and walked one in eight innings
in beating the Astros at hitter-friendly Enron Field. Before that,
Guzman was 4-1 with a 1.42 ERA in six starts for Class AAA Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   He made his share of mistakes. He opened both the first and
second innings by walking the first batter he faced. And he opened
the third by giving up a hit to the opposing pitcher, Halama,
almost as much of a no-no. But he came back to keep Seattle off the
scoreboard inning after inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had trouble picking up the ball against him,'' Cameron said.
``I don't think he was anything special.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither was Halama, making his first start since July 5.
Although he didn't walk anyone, Halama's pitch location was
sporadic, and he got too many pitches up where hitters thrive. Jay
Bell hurt Halama with hits his first three times up, including a
run-scoring triple in the third inning and a single in the fourth
that accounted for another run, capping a three-run rally that put
the game firmly in Arizona's grip.
</P>
<P>
   ``John didn't locate his pitches all that well,'' Piniella said.
``But he got into the seventh inning. He should be sharper the next
time.''
</P>
<P>
   So should the Mariners' offense, now that Martinez is part of
the equation again.

ANGELS BREATHE A SIGH OF RELIEF
</HEADLINE>
 ... WRITETHROUGH (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Brian Cooper was credited with the victory in the
Anaheim Angels' 3-2 win over the San Diego Padres on Monday night
before 19,930 at Qualcomm Stadium. But he couldn't have done it
without a little help from his friends.
</P>
<P>
   Four relievers _ Mark Petkovsek, Mike Holtz, Shigetoshi Hasegawa
and Troy Percival _ combined for the final 2 innings to save it for
Cooper (4-3), who allowed two runs and four hits in 6 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper was good, but the bullpen was perfect. The four retired
all eight batters they faced, including three by strikeout.
Percival pitched the ninth and rebounded from his blown save Sunday
to earn hit 22nd save of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels managed just enough offense off Padres starter Matt
Clement (9-8). Mo Vaughn had an RBI double in the first inning to
score Darin Erstad (2 for 4), and reserve catcher Matt Walbeck had
a two-run homer in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   It was enough, just barely. The Angels didn't have a baserunner
after Erstad singled to lead off the fifth. The final 15 Angels
batters were retired in order.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Angels bullpen was shutting down the Padres as well,
the offense wasn't needed after the fourth inning. It was nothing
new. The bullpen has an ERA of 1.98 over the past 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any team at the top of their division wouldn't be there
without a solid bullpen,'' said Percival, who hit 97 mph on the
radar gun. ``They've been great. Especially when every one of the
guys, except (Mike) Fyhrie, has struggled for a solid two or three
weeks, and every one has battled out of it. Now if we can get the
closer going, we'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Self-deprecating humor aside, Percival was a completely
different pitcher than he was one day earlier when he blew a 5-4
lead in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sharper for sure,'' Percival said. ``I knew my fastball
was good tonight. Yesterday I didn't have a good feel for it.
Yesterday I had a bad approach. It's just a matter of getting out
there and trusting my stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys have been there and sometimes they get lost in the
shuffle,'' Angels manager Mike Scioscia said of the bullpen.
``There's a lot of focus on blown saves with Percival, but that's
not what it's about at all.... These guys are on the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper retired 10 Padres hitters in a row during one stretch
between the first and fifth innings and didn't allow a hit in
innings 2-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found my tempo and got to where I was throwing strikes and
they were putting the ball in play,'' Cooper said. ``Usually the
first inning is the toughest for me. When I do get into the middle
innings, I feel extremely confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, though, didn't have his best stuff Monday. At least
that's what his catcher said.
</P>
<P>
   ``His breaking ball wasn't there, he didn't locate his fastball,
his changeup was mediocre and his slider was nonexistent,'' Walbeck
said. ``But he had a huge heart. He literally willed outs out
there. I'm a firm believer if you have a huge heart, you can get
away with mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper appeared to run out of gas in the seventh, when he walked
two consecutive hitters with one out. Scioscia went to his bullpen
and it bailed out Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   ``He walked those two guys in the seventh and I thought his
command was wavering a bit,'' Scioscia said. ``I didn't want to
wait to see if he would get it back. But he battled the whole way
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Petkovsek replaced Cooper with two on and one out in the seventh
and got Eric Owens on a liner to third for the second out. Scioscia
then went to Holtz, who got Joe Vitiello to end the inning on a
force play. The Padres didn't have another baserunner the rest of
the way.

FINE NIGHT FOR DREIFORT
</HEADLINE>
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Davey Johnson didn't have cable-TV in his hospital
room, but no doubt he had Darren Dreifort on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers manager spent a second night Monday
undergoing treatment for an irregular heartbeat and through his
doctors learned his erratic right-hander withstood a sloppy start
to defeat the Pittsburgh Pirates 9-6 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was eager to be with the crowd of 25,261 and is expected
to be back in uniform by the end of the homestand. Perhaps more
importantly, Dreifort retired 11 of the final 12 Pirates he faced
to win for just the second time since May 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw a lot of things tonight that make this a great team,''
interim manager Jim Tracy said. ``But (Dreifort) really did the job
and we need that. He just got better and better.''
</P>
<P>
   Relief pitcher Terry Adams didn't make it easy when he took over
for Dreifort and allowed three runs in the eighth, including a
two-run homer by Kevin Young.
</P>
<P>
   But Gary Sheffield, National League Player of the Week,
countered with a two-run homer of his own in the bottom of the
inning, his 32nd and Jeff Shaw pitched the final 1 innings for his
first save since June 18.
</P>
<P>
   Add it up and the victory was the Dodgers' (47-44) second
straight under Tracy and kept them five games back of
division-leading Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see the smile on my face,'' said Shaw, who has been
battling arm problems. ``There a lot of good things all around. I
swear Sheff is the Player of the Week every week. And getting a
game like that out of (Dreifort) is a good sign for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracy's troops took it to the Pirates and moved into third place
in the West after Colorado split a doubleheader with Oakland.
Pittsburgh might have known there could be trouble starting
right-hander Bronson Arroyo (0-2, 9.33 ERA). Make that 0-3.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Elster had a two-run double in the second and Jim Leyritz
added a two-run single in the seventh that blew the game open.
Struggling right-fielder Shawn Green even brought the crowd to its
feet when he was thrown out trying to stretch a third-inning triple
into an inside-the-park home run.
</P>
<P>
   But this night belonged to Dreifort (5-7), who even drove in the
eventual winning run when he was struck on the left toe by a pitch
from left-hander Chris Peters with the bases loaded in the sixth.
It scored Eric Karros, who reached on an error by shortstop Pat
Meares.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort allowed four hits and three runs in seven innings,
walked just two and struck out eight. He even gave the Dodgers the
lead for good when he took a pitch off his left foot with the bases
loaded in the sixth. It was the first victory by a Dodgers starter
not named Kevin Brown since June 18.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort entered the game winless in his past six starts after
pitching a two-hit shutout more than two months ago against the
first-place Cardinals in St. Louis. But he followed it by allowing
six runs in just 4 innings against the lowly Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Monday didn't start out well. After the Dodgers scored three
runs in the second, Dreifort gave back the lead. Brian Giles tied
the game in the third on a two-run homer to left-center.
</P>
<P>
   Although Johnson pleaded with the Dodgers to let him return to
the field, team internist Michael Mellman insisted the manager
remain under observation a second night at Centinela Hospital
Medical Center in Inglewood.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson takes medication for high blood pressure and missed one
game in 1996 with an irregular heartbeat when he managed Baltimore.
He successfully underwent a second day of tests Monday and was
examined by cardiologist Phillip Frankel.
</P>
<P>
   Mellman, however, said Johnson probably would not rejoin the
club until the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wishes and Davey's wishes are somewhat different,'' Mellman
said with a smile. ``He is very anxious to leave. I have to block
his door.''

FOR START-UPS, NOT ALL VENTURE CAPITAL IS THE SAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Money is money, right?
</P>
<P>
   Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley, money comes in infinite shades of green. This
is what James and Jon Slavet _ gangly brothers who grew up in
Weston _ found out when they came out here last year to build their
Internet start-up.
</P>
<P>
   Having garnered $60 million from investors for Guru.com, a site
that matches freelancers with jobs, the Slavets came away with a
big lesson about the rituals of raising capital in the Valley: Not
all money is the same. The hoops they needed to jump through when
raising their first dollar were vastly different from what was
required to raise their last.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, it gets increasingly clinical as you go higher up
the money chain,'' said James Slavet, 30, the younger of the two
brothers and a recent graduate of Harvard Business School. ``This
last round, the investors snapped on the rubber gloves and went
through our financial statements with a scalpel. In the beginning,
no one even asked us for our business plan. They just wanted the
three-page executive summary.''
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurs tend to raise money in rounds, once they have
exhausted their own savings and the contributions of so-called
``friends, families, and fools.'' The first round generally comes
from wealthy individuals, often called ``angels.'' The next round
or two involves venture capital firms. And in the later rounds, the
list of investors usually includes key companies that do business
with the start-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of these rounds tends to have a slightly different flavor
to it,'' said Jim Creigh, vice president and general counsel of
Garage.com, a business incubator in Palo Alto, Calif., that advises
and invests in start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, entrepreneurs need to tune into the varied needs of
their investors and alter their pitches accordingly, said James
Slavet.
</P>
<P>
   Angels, for example, are less interested in detailed financial
information, since there isn't much of a company to analyze in the
beginning. Early stage investors are more interested in the idea
and the founders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a saying here: Bet on the jockey, not on the horse,''
said Creigh, who has brokered numerous deals in his previous job as
an attorney with Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &AMP; Rosati, a high-powered
technology law firm in Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   In the second round, the focus broadens to include key
employees, said Jon Slavet, who is 32 and Guru.com's chief salesman
and dealmaker, while his more analytical younger brother makes sure
the company functions smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The questions in the second round centered more around other
members of our team,'' said the elder Slavet. ``They also wanted to
talk to our customers. They wanted to see if we had the ability to
execute our idea.''
</P>
<P>
   As the company grows, investors become more interested in the
nuts and bolts of the business and less on the people running it.
The importance of the founders fade, while the business itself
takes center stage. The Slavets prepared for their third round of
financing by putting together a book chock full of numbers, charts,
and projections.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time you get to the later rounds, there's more of a
company there,'' said Creigh. ``In most instances, the founders
could leave, and the company could still survive. The due diligence
becomes more of a classic financial decision in evaluating the
company as a going concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors in this round tend to be companies that have a
strategic stake in the start-up's success. Consequently, start-ups
will take money they don't need from a strategic partner, usually a
large company operating in the same industry.
</P>
<P>
   One company, Optical Networking Inc. in San Jose, Calif.,
courted its largest customer, Williams Communications, as an
investor. ``Sometimes, people do financing for nonfinancial
reasons, as a way to cement an operating or strategic
relationship,'' Creigh said.
</P>
<P>
   Says Jon Slavet: ``The questions are posed with an eye toward
going public. They want to know whether there is a huge market
opportunity there to sustain a public company, and whether you can
be number one in your field. It's about painting a picture of this
huge mountaintop as their opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   James Slavet chimes in: ``And guess what? We're going to get to
that mountaintop first.''

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Bill Hunzeker, the most important new-product rollout at
this week's MacWorld trade show in New York won't be a faster
microchip or an upgraded operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Hunzeker makes computer mice. And he's fidgeting with
eagerness to see if the rumors are true that Apple Computer Inc. is
finally going to change the design of the mice it ships with its
Macintosh computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job hinges on what the hell Apple does next week,''
Hunzeker, a product manager for Contour Design Inc. of Salem, N.H.,
says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Contour Design is a maker of ``aftermarket'' computer mice for
people who've worn out their original mice or just don't like them.
The Mac's mouse has been a gold mine for Contour.
</P>
<P>
   Despite rave reviews for the performance and beauty of newer
Macintosh computers, many users have railed against the mice that
come with them. The current design resembles a hockey puck, and
critics have called it clumsy and hard to use. That's fine with
Contour Design. It's sold thousands of its UniMouse replacement
units, styled more like traditional computer mice.
</P>
<P>
   If Apple finally abandons its present mouse, says Hunzeker,
sales of the UniMouse will likely plummet. ``I would expect I will
lose a good chunk of the mouse business,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Hunzeker notes that apart from its unpopularity, the old mouse
may not work well with Mac OS X, the new operating system set for
release next year. OS X is based on a variant of the high-powered
Unix operating system, and Unix computers normally use mice with
two or three buttons. The Mac has always used a one-button mouse.
Hunzeker's betting that the move to OS X will force Apple to adopt
a new mouse design with two buttons, and probably a more
comfortable feel as well.
</P>
<P>
   The mouse isn't Hunzeker's only worry. His company also makes a
special stand for holding Apple's popular iMac computers. When
Apple upgraded the iMac last year, the new models no longer fit on
the old stands. Now Hunzeker's hearing that future iMacs will have
17-inch monitors instead of today's 15-inch displays. Once again,
Contour's stands will have to be upgraded.
</P>
<P>
   And because of Apple's penchant for secrecy, Hunzeker can't get
the information he needs to start redesigning his products. ``We
can't prepare for it,'' he says, ``because we haven't seen the
prototype.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he will, this week. Then again, maybe not. An Apple
spokesman flatly refused to provide a sneak peek of this week's
design news. Hunzeker will just have to fly to New York and keep
his fingers crossed.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The success of Apple's colorful iMac computer certainly got the
attention of rival PC makers. They've served up a number of gaudy,
sleek machines designed to appeal to the sort of people who see a
computer as a fashion statement.
</P>
<P>
   Only it turns out there aren't as many such people as the
companies thought _ at least not in the United States. Last week,
Compaq Computer Corp. announced that it was pulling its Presario
3500 home PC from the American market, where it's been languishing.
</P>
<P>
   The Presario 3500 featured a lean and shapely casing and a
fashionable flat-panel display screen, done up in a dark, rich
shade of blue. It also featured an exalted price of $1,999.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a product that was originally created for the Asian
market,'' says Compaq spokeswoman Cherry Harris. But it was decided
that American customers might embrace the 3500 at Christmastime,
when they might be willing to spend considerably more than usual
for a PC. Not so; the pricey machines gathered dust as consumers
continued to opt for machines that were equally capable, but much
less costly.
</P>
<P>
   ``US consumers are a little more cost-conscious,'' Harris
admits. But she adds that the Presario 3500 still sells well in
Asia, and Compaq will continue to market it there.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq isn't the only PC maker to discover the market for
cool-looking machines is smaller than expected. Dell Computer Corp.
recently abandoned its sleek WebPC product line, introduced in
November. ``This has proven to be a very good experiment for us,''
says Dell spokesman Bob Kaufman. He says elements of WebPC's design
will be in future Dell products.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kaufman conceded that sales of the WebPC didn't meet
expectations. ``We have many customers who really liked and bought
and embraced Web PC,'' he says. Too bad there weren't quite enough
of them.

<P>
   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. _ If there was an Ironman competition for
starting the most companies, Wu Fu Chen would be a contender.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, 50, looks nothing like your average Ironman. He walks with
a slight stoop, peers through thick spectacles and sports a black
plastic digital watch. The walls in his office have none of the
usual executive's trophies, diplomas, or photos of himself with
famous people. In fact, they are completely bare.
</P>
<P>
   But don't let looks fool you. In the world of data networking,
Chen is regarded as an entrepreneur par excellence. Having founded
a dozen technology companies in the past 14 years, including
Cascade Communications, Chen has amassed a gold-medal reputation
among venture capitalists, as well as a sizable fortune. He is
estimated to be worth several hundred million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for the son of a poor farmer from Taiwan whose family
had to borrow money for Chen's plane ticket to the United States in
1974.
</P>
<P>
   But Chen is just one of a growing number of Asian entrepreneurs
turbo-charging Silicon Valley's technology engine. Between 1995 and
1998, nearly three in 10 companies started in the Valley had Asian
founders, a study by the University of California at Berkeley
found. The numbers include Asian-Americans as well as immigrants.
Asians account for about 17 percent of Silicon Valley's population
in San Mateo and Santa Clara counties, according to 1990 US Census
Bureau data.
</P>
<P>
   ``When locals here claim that Silicon Valley is built on ICs,
they're not referring to the integrated circuit, but to Indian and
Chinese engineers,'' said Anna Lee Saxenian, a Berkeley professor
and author of the study on Asian immigrants in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a whole bunch of companies started by Asians,'' said
Venky Harinarayan, a 32-year-old entrepreneur from India who
founded Jungle.com, an e-commerce software company that was sold to
Amazon.com in 1998 for $180 million. ``It's amazing how many there
are. The harder question is: Why?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer to that question has particular relevance today as
Congress debates whether to expand the number of visas given to
skilled workers to alleviate the nation's dire shortage of
technology workers.
</P>
<P>
   To battle critics, proponents of immigration are arguing that
entrepreneurial immigrants create jobs rather than take away work
from natives. In addition, immigrants are starting to develop
business ties back to their homelands, fostering trade and creating
a situation in which a brain drain to the United States is yielding
to ``brain circulation.''
</P>
<P>
   Asian immigration to Silicon Valley, and to other American
technology centers from Boston to Seattle, can be traced in part to
past US immigration policy, which in 1990 was liberalized to nearly
triple the number of visas granted to skilled workers. The result
is that one-third of all scientists in Silicon Valley are
foreign-born, and that two-thirds of these are Asian, according to
Saxenian's study.
</P>
<P>
   While Asians are typically defined as people from China, Taiwan,
Hong Kong, India, Pakistan, and other South and Southeast Asian
countries, the vast majority of Asian engineers are Chinese and
Indian, Saxenian found. In 1998, Indian and Chinese engineers were
senior executives at one-quarter of Silicon Valley's new technology
companies. These businesses accounted for more than $16.8 billion
in sales and 58,282 jobs that year, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of America's newcomers, the Asians are more prone to
risk-taking than the average person, some say. Others say that, in
order to gain entry into the United States, immigrants must exhibit
some level of skill or education, making them more likely to be
entrepreneurial. Still others cite social reinforcements such as a
myriad of ethnic professional associations that immigrant groups
build up to support themselves and one another in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``For immigrants, it's about survival,'' said Pauline Lo Alker,
chief executive and cofounder of Amplify.net, her sixth start-up
since 1964. Lo Alker is also president of the Asian American
Manufacturers Association and is starting up HongKongSV.com (the SV
stands for Silicon Valley).
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a people business,'' she said. ``To survive, you have
to meet the right people. These organizations are about
facilitating that.''
</P>
<P>
   Another hotly debated theory about why the Asians succeed
involves the glass ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until recently, there has been a bit of a glass ceiling that
dictated that Asians were better employed as engineers,'' said
William P. Tai, a venture capitalist who began his career as a
microprocessor designer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marketing and management were performed by white Americans.
That forced a sense of community among Asians who believed that, in
order to advance, they needed to strike out and form their own
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People saw us as good techies, not necessarily good
businesspeople,'' said Suhas Patil, founder of Cirrus Logic and a
former professor of electrical engineering at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   But John Chen of Sybase disputes the glass-ceiling notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't buy that,'' he said. ``I have never bumped into a
glass ceiling.''
</P>
<P>
   Saxenian believes there is truth in both points of view. In her
study, she found little disparity between white and Asian engineers
in pay, but Asians were less likely to be employed as managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is consistent with the findings of other researchers who
document greater disparities in managerial representation and
upward mobility than in wage levels between Asian and white
engineers with comparable skills and education,'' Saxenian wrote.
Her study quotes an Asian entrepreneur who said Asians were seen as
``good work horses, not race horses.''
</P>
<P>
   Some say the abundance of Asian entrepreneurs is related to
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asians are a very entrepreneurial people,'' said Chih T.
Cheung, a 29-year-old born in Fuzhou, China, who got his
undergraduate, master's in business administration, and law degrees
from Harvard University and is chief executive of HelloAsia.com in
Redwood City, Calif. ``There's a saying in China _ it is better to
be the head of a rooster than the tail of an ox. That means it's
always better to be your own boss.''
</P>
<P>
   For Indians in Silicon Valley, part of the answer may be traced
back to India itself. There, the highly competitive India Institute
of Technology, with campuses across the country, has cranked out
thousands of English-speaking, technologically astute graduates who
come to the United States seeking graduate education and then stay
on to start companies. Graduates of IIT have even formed an alumni
network in Silicon Valley, with similar groups in Boston and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the Indians who come here are engineers from IIT,''
said Srini Anumolu, founder of eLance in Sunnyvale, Calif., and,
like Harinarayan and Patil, an IIT graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the explanation, it is sure to be complicated by the
fact that Asian engineers aren't a monolithic force. Among the east
Asians are those from mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and other
countries. South Asians come from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and
Bangladesh. Some bring to the United States old nationalistic
grudges, others don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have specialized groups like the Chinese Software
Professionals Association or the Chinese American Semiconductor
Professionals Association,'' said John Chen, chief executive of
Sybase Inc. in Emeryville, Calif. ``There are groups tied to
geographies within Asia. Others are tied to technical areas. Some
have a political agenda, others a scientific agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we very organized?'' Chen asked rhetorically. ``If you
line them up along special interests, then, yes. But, together, we
don't speak with one common voice, one common vision. And we need
to.''
</P>
<P>
   With so many Asians in America starting up companies, one would
be tempted to argue that there has been a brain drain of talent
from Asian countries. To some extent, that is true. But their
success in America has benefits, too, as Asians reach back to their
home countries to do business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Research suggests that the `brain drain' may be leading to
`brain circulation,' '' said Saxenian.
</P>
<P>
   Examples of this abound. Chueng's HelloAsia sells Web commerce
tools to companies in Singapore, China, Hong Kong, Japan, South
Korea, and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our attitude is that Asia has 6 billion sets of eyeballs,''
Cheung said. ``We think that's a very big market for us. Asia is
where the US was three years ago, so there's a lot of opportunity
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Tai, a second-generation Taiwanese, started a company in Hong
Kong called iAsiaWorks, which earlier this year acquired AT&AMP;T's
Hong Kong Internet operations. It is now a $6-billion-a-year
Internet infrastructure company.
</P>
<P>
   Kanwal Rheki, president of the Indus Entrepreneur, an
association for South Asian entrepreneurs, and Patil of Cirrus
Logic regularly return to India. There they conduct seminars on
entrepreneurship and lobby the Indian government for reforms that
make it easier for people to start their own businesses in India
rather than having to go to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Still, entrepreneurs say Silicon Valley remains uniquely suited
to breeding Horatio Alger legends.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is a meritocratic society,'' Patil said. ``This is a
country where I can come here, and with sole enthusiasm, I can make
it my own country. There's no other place in the world like that.''

DEBUGGING BROADBAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM, Mass. _ People who have switched from dial-up Internet
access with America Online to a broadband Net connection may rave
about how much they love the speed.
</P>
<P>
   But when was the last time you ever heard of someone needing to
have AOL send a truck to their house 12 times to make their service
work?
</P>
<P>
   For all the convenience and benefits of the high-speed,
always-on Net connections offered by services such as Verizon/Bell
Atlantic digital subscriber line access and AT&AMP;T Broadband's
RoadRunner, signing up is never as easy as popping one of those AOL
disks from the Sunday paper into your computer.
</P>
<P>
   However, if Abraham Gutman and the company he started here two
years ago, Emperative Inc., succeed in their mission, broadband Net
access will be almost as easy to install as AOL. And you may never
need to spend hours on hold with technical support or have an
installer perform surgery on your home computer to get you up and
running.
</P>
<P>
   Gutman, an immigrant from Colombia, led efforts at AT&AMP;T
predecessor Continental Cablevision to roll out the area's first
cable modem service. Now he has developed a complex software
package allowing DSL and cable modem services to allow people to
sign themselves up for service.
</P>
<P>
   Already in tests at three big carriers, including RoadRunner's
Minneapolis franchise, the Emperative ProvEn system has drawn more
than $24 million in venture funding, including a key investment
from Continental, founder and industry legend Amos B. Hostetter Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conservatively, you'll see these things deployed in 18 to 24
months, probably first on the cable side rather than the DSL
side,'' Gutman said. That's because figuring out whose phone line
can support DSL remains a lot more complex than adding a cable
modem customer. Licensing the software starts at $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it might work:
</P>
<P>
   You go to Circuit City or CompUSA and buy a cable or DSL modem,
take it home, and plug it in your computer and cable plug or phone
jack. (You can buy a Verizon DSL modem this way today, but you
still need to talk to someone on the phone to get service.)
</P>
<P>
   Once the modem is installed, the network automatically records
its 14-digit identification code and displays a signup page on your
computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   You pick what service you want, register how you want to pay for
it, and select how many e-mail accounts you want and whether you
want a family home page or other options.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you don't have a cable outlet in the room where
you want your computer, you would still need to have a cable guy
come tack up a new line first. And for DSL, you would still have to
live somewhere close enough to a phone company central office
equipped for DSL _ and on a street without any phone-line anomalies
_ to allow the Emperative system to work.
</P>
<P>
   But if you already had the right connections in place, you could
have, voila, broadband in minutes, without ever having to schedule
an installation appointment within the dreaded ``two-hour window.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Self-provisioning'' for broadband is considered nothing short
of a Holy Grail for cable and phone companies. They are already
finding that projections of an America with 35 or 40 million
broadband homes on line by 2005 are crashing into the reality that
many installations still require intense on-site work by
technicians and repeat visits to fix bugs.
</P>
<P>
   Once you move to a ``self-provisioning'' world in broadband,
some interesting possibilities open up, such as ordering a new
e-mail account, or switching your ISP. Even more interesting is the
idea that you could determine how much bandwidth, or
telecommunications access, you need at a given time.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the typical cable modem customer is offered ``up to'' 1.5
megabits per second, all the time, for $40 or $50 a month. The
basic Verizon DSL package comes with 640 kilobits. But that is far
more than most people ever need to do things like Web surfing or
reading and sending e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   What if you could go online to order a service costing $20 a
month for an everyday speed of 300 kilobits per second and pay for
higher capacity only when you actually use it? Or buy ``bursting
minutes'' each month, similar to long-distance phone service, for
those occasions when you are downloading a movie or video game off
the Net?
</P>
<P>
   And once broadband became as easy to get as dial-up access
today, and maybe as cheap, you might find you had enough friends
and relatives with high-speed access to do things like making video
calls to them over your computer or trading home videos (and
pirated music albums) over the Net like e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   In aiming for automated broadband ordering, Emperative has
plenty of competition among ``integrators,'' including arms of many
of the accounting and consulting giants, that help companies make
different computer systems talk to each other. Gutman maintains
Emperative's system is far more flexible.
</P>
<P>
   Mid-America phone giant SBC Communications has also made a big
push into trying to make DSL easier to get, including a $60-a-month
plan where you buy a DSL-ready computer and the access. As it moves
into the Greater Boston market this autumn, SBC may offer this plan
locally, too.
</P>
<P>
   Gutman has had a colorful life, once running a South American
conglomerate whose three divisions included a cable TV system in
Argentina, a salmon farm in Chile, and a fresh-cut flower business.
After Continental bought half of the Argentine cable company,
Gutman became involved as a top consultant advising Continental on
its HighwayOne cable modem service.
</P>
<P>
   ``For broadband to live up to all its promise, it has to be as
easy as getting AOL,'' Gutman said. ``Today, it still requires a
ton of manual labor _ not because they are incompetent, but because
it has been hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are, vis a vis broadband, where the telephone business was
in 1920,'' Gutman said. ``That makes it a great time to be alive.''

EVERETT FLAP, FLAK WON'T END SOON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carl Everett probably needed a little vacation. Things were
getting a little too tense for the man Boston Globe sports
columnist Dan Shaughnessy calls ``Jurassic Carl.''
</P>
<P>
   A few more nutties by Everett and the Fourth Estate will start
getting really pesky, asking even tougher questions about anger
management and past claims of domestic abuse. The toughest problem
will be coming up with a nickname. ``Jurassic Carl'' is all right
for now, but it might have been more apt for slow-footed, ill-fated
former Celtics first-round draft choice Acie Earl.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one: The Phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   No telling how Everett will handle the onslaught. But it's
coming, and Shaughnessy and nicknames will be the least of his
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The latest meltdown by the Red Sox center fielder came Saturday
in the second inning against the Mets. Home plate umpire Ron Kulpa
ordered Everett to stand inside the batter's box, Everett
disagreed, and next thing you know, Everett is ejected. He left the
field four minutes after the ejection, but not without head-butting
Kulpa.
</P>
<P>
   ``His behavior right now is embarrassing,'' said Joe Buck, who
was working the national telecast for Fox. ``It's uncalled for and
he is 100 percent out of control. His coaches can't keep him calm.
Nobody is applauding what Carl Everett just did, and if he's trying
to find an audience in his dugout, none of (the Red Sox) are
willing to commiserate with what just took place.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Tim McCarver was equally shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something the Red Sox cannot afford is to have one of their
best players miss time, and he is going to miss time right now,''
McCarver said after Everett head-butted the umpire. ``That's five
to 10 days right there. They've got to get him out of there. This
is an ugly scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Fox interviewed Everett about his unusual
batting stance, and the footage was aired after Everett's
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I encourage pitchers to try and come in there,'' Everett told
Fox. ``I'll let them know I like it in. I'm closer to the plate
just because I know that the majority of the pitchers in baseball
can't hit that spot. I don't care at all. I'm not afraid of
anything. I grew out of that when I was a child.''

   Monday night quarterback
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boomer Esiason is back with Monday night football. But this time
it is with Westwood One/CBS Radio Sports, for which he will work
with play-by-play announcer Howard David and analyst Matt Millen
starting with the Sept. 4 game between St. Louis and Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The former All-Pro quarterback was fired from ABC last year, and
on his way out the door, he blasted the network and particularly Al
Michaels, saying the legendary announcer would prefer working in a
booth alone.
</P>
<P>
   Esiason said he is over the firing now and is looking forward to
calling at least two seasons on radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't really a spot in television at this point,''
Esiason told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Esiason readily admits that he was emotional and outspoken about
his ABC experience. He worked there for two seasons, first as part
of a three-man booth with Michaels and Dan Dierdorf and later with
only Michaels. Last month, ABC hired comedian Dennis Miller and Dan
Fouts to work with Michaels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't worry about what has transpired,'' Esiason said.
``Certainly when you get released from somewhere, you get down and
are emotional about it. I'm over it. It's like anything else, where
you get fired from someplace and they want to replace you. I've
always worn my feelings on my sleeve. It took me a while. No one
ever wants to be told they can't do a job they think they're good
at.''
</P>
<P>
   Esiason said the radio work will not be as commercialized as
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't be up against the windows of promotions and
billboards, where we have to keep our ideas short,'' he said. ``I'm
looking forward to getting into it with Millen.''
</P>
<P>
   David, who is also the Celtics' radio announcer, said he is
excited as well, and blessed to have Esiason and Millen, both of
whom are capable broadcasters and personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Millen and Esiason, who played against each other, talked about
some of their on-field discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millen was one of those guys who liked to carry on
conversations,'' Esiason said. ``I remember one time when he was
sweating and had all kinds of stuff running out his nose and he was
telling me to run the ball inside. I told him we weren't going to
do that because he couldn't catch the play outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Millen said Esiason made the game fun because he wouldn't get
rattled by trash talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boomer could handle not only the game but also the
conversations,'' Millen said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

LAVASTORM HELPS WEB SITES TAKE HITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't go to LavaStorm with lightweight assignments.
</P>
<P>
   These guys pride themselves on tackling some of the toughest
problems on the Internet _ like writing a program to let 4 million
people log on to an interactive Web site at the same moment.
</P>
<P>
   That's more than twice as many visits as the top sites get in an
entire day.
</P>
<P>
   The Waltham, Mass. systems engineering company is the story
behind the story at sites like Monster.com, the recruiting outfit;
FamilySearch.org, the site for genealogy buffs; and GoldPocket.com,
the Web game show that gives away $1 million every Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't buy a package or a search technology to build
this architecture,'' says chief executive V. Miller Newton (that's
Virgil Miller Newton IV, if you must know) of LavaStorm. ``You had
to build this from scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   Venture investors seem to like this story. LavaStorm will
announce that it's landed $45 million in its second round of
financing, led by Oak Investment Partners of Westport, Conn.,
Intel, Lehman Brothers, and Reuters Greenhouse Fund. And its
first-round financiers from last October, the famous San Francisco
firm Hummer Winblad Venture Partners, is also in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   That's good money for a company in a crowded field. Newton
himself concedes that big consultants and firms with other
approaches are competing to help companies build systems solutions.
Hummer Winblad partner Mark Gorenberg says it's LavaStorm's focus
on highly complex jobs that's attractive. With no small bias, he
predicts they'll be ``the premier player'' in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Newton says he raised more money than he may need to get through
the next 12 to 18 months. That's because he wants to focus on
growing the company, instead of on raising money, he says.
LavaStorm has been operating on the $10 million it amassed in its
first round. And it's been hiring like gangbusters, adding 120
people in the first half of this year _ mainly engineers and
technical talent _ for a total of 170 employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us some running room,'' he says of the cash.
</P>
<P>
   Newton, 41, joined LavaStorm last year _ from a key client. He
was chief executive of Maynard's Monster.com. You might think
that's a blimp company, if you've been anywhere around Boston
lately. But it's a recruiting, job-hunting, and resume-help site
that Newton helped grow to $45 million in annual revenues in 18
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pretty wild ride,'' says the longtime marketing
executive. He hired LavaStorm _ founded in 1993 by Justin Lindsey
and a group of MIT engineers _ because Monster.com's site was
getting slow and unreliable as the number of job hunters using it
soared toward 2 million. The number now exceeds 8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Newton brings experience to the game. He got to Monster via its
parent, TMP Worldwide, a publicly traded New York marketing
company, where he'd worked for 12 years, most recently as chief of
sales and marketing. He's no techie; he relies on the engineering
gurus for that.
</P>
<P>
   If the company has made a splash with giant family-tree sites
(the Mormon Church's FamilySearch.org and a new client,
OneGreatFamily.com), a job site and a popular game show, its future
is in two broad categories, Newton predicts.
</P>
<P>
   One of LavaStorm's early successes was EdgarWatch, the online
site for accessing financial filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. That's translated to a big push in financial
services and banking, the boss says. And GoldPocket, which has put
money in the hands of four winners so far, is all about online
events, he says.
</P>
<P>
   The company's driving principal is not modest. Its Web site
touts systems that give clients a competitive advantage and
``disrupt the playing field forever.''

<P>
   BEIJING _ In the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, just
over the border from high-flying Hong Kong, there's a saying: If a
man doesn't keep a concubine, he's not successful.
</P>
<P>
   Well, there are a lot of successful men in Guangdong. So
successful, in fact, some men have acquired not only a second
``wife,'' they have even a third or a fourth. It's called bao ernai
in Chinese, or taking a second wife. And like the concubines of
traditional China, she gets money, gifts and usually even a house
to live in from her married lover. She often even bears him
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Guangdong, the bao ernai phenomenon has reached the point
where we can no longer ignore it,'' Cui Shuhui, an official of the
state-run All-China Women's Federation recently told the Yangcheng
Evening News, a Guangdong newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has become so serious, local law enforcement could
no longer wait for China's outdated divorce laws to catch up. So
last month, four provincial law-enforcement and judicial agencies
jointly issued a legal ``opinion'' _ which they claim has the
weight of law _ that makes it easier for women to divorce husbands
who bao ernai.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion entitles the wife to half of everything her husband
has bought for his mistress, even if the item, such as a house, car
or stocks, is in the other woman's name. If the wife has no hard
evidence that her husband has been cheating, the opinion allows
police to help her obtain it.
</P>
<P>
   Local women's groups that had been demanding something be done

the legal opinion was announced, the phones at local offices of the

One reporter wrote that in two days of interviewing women, the

<P>
   The Guangdong opinion comes just as the communist National
People's Congress, China's legislature, is in the midst of debating
a badly-needed revision of the marriage law. Chinese society has
seen huge changes since the law was last updated in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Divorce rates have more than tripled; domestic violence has
increased; and marriages now are based more on individuals'
feelings rather than the old standard of political or familial
ties. The current law gives few guidelines on how to handle issues
such as support payments, splitting assets and custody of children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision to amend the law comes at a time when Chinese
society is increasingly troubled by such social problems as
proliferating concubinage and worsening family viol This phenomenon
seriously goes against socialist morality and customs . . . and
seriously impacts social stability and family planning.''

   Although concubines are most common in Guangdong, they exist in
other prosperous regions also. In Shanghai it's called ``keeping a
golden canary,'' that is, a lovely, frail creature who lives in a
cage and comes out only when you take it out. In Beijing, she's
called a ``little honey.''
</P>

<P>
   ``It's a status symbol,'' said Liu Donghua, a lawyer at the

University. ``Men think, 'Everyone else is doing it,' so they just
copy.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 percent of cases at the non-profit law center are
for divorce. Of those, almost one-fifth involve extra-marital
relations. To be sure, cases of adulterous women are numerous also
but are vastly outnumbered by philandering husbands. Some men even
bring their mistresses home, Liu said, forcing wife and concubine
to live under one roof.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the Guangdong opinion doesn't go far enough. Liu, for
example, believes that not only should the husband be made to pay
compensation, so should the other woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The third party has to take responsibility for destroying a
family,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other legal experts in China believe that would be allowing the
law to go too far into the moral realm. Even allowing police to
help gather evidence of adultery, as the Guangdong opinion does,
opens personal lives up to dangerous abuses of police power, says
sociologist Li Yinhe, a researcher at the state-run Chinese Academy
of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Such disputes have been dividing feminists since a revision of
the marriage law was first proposed in 1995. Passage this year is
unlikely, experts say.

   BEIJING _ In the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, just
over the border from high-flying Hong Kong, there's a saying: If a
man doesn't keep a concubine, he's not successful.
</P>
<P>
   Well, there are a lot of successful men in Guangdong. So
successful, in fact, some men have acquired not only a second
``wife,'' they have even a third or a fourth. It's called bao ernai
in Chinese, or taking a second wife. And like the concubines of
traditional China, she gets money, gifts and usually even a house
to live in from her married lover. She often even bears him
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Guangdong, the bao ernai phenomenon has reached the point
where we can no longer ignore it,'' Cui Shuhui, an official of the
state-run All-China Women's Federation recently told the Yangcheng
Evening News, a Guangdong newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has become so serious, local law enforcement could
no longer wait for China's outdated divorce laws to catch up. So
last month, four provincial law-enforcement and judicial agencies
jointly issued a legal ``opinion'' _ which they claim has the
weight of law _ that makes it easier for women to divorce husbands
who bao ernai.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion entitles the wife to half of everything her husband
has bought for his mistress, even if the item, such as a house, car
or stocks, is in the other woman's name. If the wife has no hard
evidence that her husband has been cheating, the opinion allows
police to help her obtain it.
</P>
<P>
   Local women's groups that had been demanding something be done
to protect the financial interests of wives are over-joyed. Since
the legal opinion was announced, the phones at local offices of the
All-China Women's Federation, which operates at all levels of
government, have been ringing off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   The Yangcheng Evening News called the opinion a ``huge bomb.''
One reporter wrote that in two days of interviewing women, the
phrase he heard most often was: ``I was so excited I couldn't sleep

</P>
<P>
   ``The decision to amend the law comes at a time when Chinese
society is increasingly troubled by such social problems as
proliferating concubinage and worsening family violence,'' said
Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency.
</P>
<P>
   The divorce rate was just 3 percent in 1980 but has climbed to
13 percent. In large cities, such as Beijing and Shanghai, it is
well over 25 percent. A 1998 survey in Shanghai found that 36
percent of divorces were due to incompatibility and 22 percent to
extramarital affairs, according to Xinhua.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Prof.t foreign businessmen who are taking second wives,'' said
Hu Kanghsang, an official of the National People's Congress
Standing Committee who is working on the marriage law revision.
``It also includes domestic factory heads, executives, private
businessmen, even party cadres. This phenomenon seriously goes
against socialist morality and customs . . . and seriously impacts
social stability and family planning.''

Milem is a 6-foot-9, 290-pound defensive end in 49ers training

   LITERARY-WARS (San Francisco) _ In the art of betrayal, writers
have it made. Instead of going to jail for assault and battery,
they get to splatter blood all over the page, which then becomes

enhance the stature of the writer. Best of all, the writer gets

 &HT;    Broker's just a click away
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ James Olsen of Atlanta shifted his investment
portfolio to an online broker five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He was an early bird. At the present, 16 million Americans have
established Internet accounts to manage at least a portion of their
investments.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of every 12 adults in the country, and the ratio is
changing fast. Online brokers opened 2.5 million new accounts in
the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   At Fidelity alone, assets in online accounts went from $170
billion in May 1999 to $300 billion in May 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first it was just an interesting thing,'' the 32-year-old
Olsen said, ``but then I found out it was a useful tool.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy accessibility is a major reason why people start investing
through Internet accounts. ``I can check my portfolio at 10 o'clock
at night,'' said Olsen. He also uses his Fidelity account to gather
information about potential investments, as well as for buying and
selling.
</P>
<P>
   Low transaction costs are another attraction. A number of online
brokerages charge only $5 for each trade. A few are lower than
that, and two offer free trades.
</P>
<P>
   Price-cutting by the earliest online brokers drew such a crowd
of investors that it compelled full-service brokers to join the
game, at more-or-less competitive prices.
</P>
<P>
   One warning is in order: Online investing is a mechanism for
buying and selling securities. It doesn't make an investor wise or
well-informed, and it certainly will not make you effortlessly
rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do not have the knowledge and the time and discipline
to do your research, to know what you're buying, then this is not
for you,'' said Kyle Flynn, a certified financial planner.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential problem: Easy trading can lead to frequent,
ill-considered decisions. ``It's the same thing as opening the
refrigerator, seeing the apple pie and not being able to resist
it,'' said Carol Hartz, an investor and an officer of Atlanta's
chapter of the American Association of Individual Investors. ``If
you know you're going to be tempted, it's a good thing to stay away
from.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by economists at the University of California at
Davis reported the results of 1,607 investors who switched to
online brokers. Before the switch, their returns beat the market by
an average of 2 percent. Online, they made 3 percent less than the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Note also that online investing has its particular problems. On
heavy trading days _ including days when the market takes a header
_ investors routinely find they can't get through to their brokers
or can't get trades executed quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a real person to answer the phone can also be difficult.
Ironically, the rapid growth of online investing has made it hard
for brokerages to hire enough employees to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission reported 3,313 complaints
about broker dealers in the year ended last September. On the one
hand, that's three times as many complaints as the year before. On
the other hand, that's 3,313 complaints out of about 11 million
accounts last September.
</P>

www.sec.gov/consumer/jneton.htm. While you're there, check out the
link to the Federal Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some things to keep in mind if you're shopping for an
online broker:
</P>
<P>
   Check the broker's performance at making trades.
</P>
<P>
   ``If their systems get bogged down and don't process your orders
quickly, that can hurt you,'' said Dan Dubay, a certified financial
planner and a principal in PPA Advisory Services in Roswell.
</P>
<P>
   The accompanying chart shows Web sites that can help you check
out this and other factors.
</P>
<P>
   Ask what research capacity the broker will supply.
</P>
<P>
   Dubay advises asking whether the broker will give you access to
outside research reports as well as its own.
</P>
<P>
   Decide exactly what services you need.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 175 online brokers now, according to some
counts. As competition increases, consumers get access to more
varied services. Some offer advice as well as research. Some will
provide access to professional advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Hartz said she picked Schwab not because of its transaction
prices but for the services it offers. She was attracted by free
switching among numerous mutual funds and consolidated statements,
as well as other things.
</P>
<P>
   Consider keeping one foot in the real world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find that people usually do some things online and other
things offline,'' said Tracey Curvey, Fidelity's executive vice
president for online investments. ``Most people still like talking
to a phone representative or walking into an investment center.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask about the broker's insurance.
</P>
<P>
   You're looking for protection in case the brokerage goes under,
said Dubay. In general, he suggested sticking with major
brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   The largest online brokers, ranked by assets at the end of 1999,
are Schwab, ETrade, TD Waterhouse, Fidelity, Datek, Ameritrade, DLJ
Direct, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Cybercorp and Suretrade. The
list was prepared by U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget investment costs.
</P>
<P>
   This is not overwhelmingly important for people who invest for
the long term, rather than trading for quick profits.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Dubay points out, a broker might have competitive prices
on large transactions but relatively high charges for buying 100 or
200 shares. ``You need to compare pricing on whatever kind of
transactions you're doing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Test drive the broker's Web site. If it's hard to use, you
probably won't want to use it.

 &HT;    Broker's just a click away
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ James Olsen of Atlanta shifted his investment
portfolio to an online broker five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He was an early bird. At the present, 16 million Americans have
established Internet accounts to manage at least a portion of their
investments.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of every 12 adults in the country, and the ratio is
changing fast. Online brokers opened 2.5 million new accounts in
the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   At Fidelity alone, assets in online accounts went from $170
billion in May 1999 to $300 billion in May 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first it was just an interesting thing,'' the 32-year-old
Olsen said, ``but then I found out it was a useful tool.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy accessibility is a major reason why people start investing
through Internet accounts. ``I can check my portfolio at 10 o'clock
at night,'' said Olsen. He also uses his Fidelity account to gather
information about potential investments, as well as for buying and
selling.
</P>
<P>
   Low transaction costs are another attraction. A number of online
brokerages charge only $5 for each trade. A few are lower than
that, and two offer free trades.
</P>
<P>
   Price-cutting by the earliest online brokers drew such a crowd
of investors that it compelled full-service brokers to join the
game, at more-or-less competitive prices.
</P>
<P>
   One warning is in order: Online investing is a mechanism for
buying and selling securities. It doesn't make an investor wise or
well-informed, and it certainly will not make you effortlessly
rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do not have the knowledge and the time and discipline
to do your research, to know what you're buying, then this is not
for you,'' said Kyle Flynn, a certified financial planner.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential problem: Easy trading can lead to frequent,
ill-considered decisions. ``It's the same thing as opening the
refrigerator, seeing the apple pie and not being able to resist
it,'' said Carol Hartz, an investor and an officer of Atlanta's
chapter of the American Association of Individual Investors. ``If
you know you're going to be tempted, it's a good thing to stay away
from.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by economists at the University of California at
Davis reported the results of 1,607 investors who switched to
online brokers. Before the switch, their returns beat the market by
an average of 2 percent. Online, they made 3 percent less than the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Note also that online investing has its particular problems. On
heavy trading days _ including days when the market takes a header
_ investors routinely find they can't get through to their brokers
or can't get trades executed quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a real person to answer the phone can also be difficult.
Ironically, the rapid growth of online investing has made it hard
for brokerages to hire enough employees to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission reported 3,313 complaints
about broker dealers in the year ended last September. On the one
hand, that's three times as many complaints as the year before. On
the other hand, that's 3,313 complaints out of about 11 million
accounts last September.
</P>
<P>
   For tips on protecting yourself, go to
www.sec.gov/consumer/jneton.htm. While you're there, check out the
link to the Federal Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some things to keep in mind if you're shopping for an
online broker:
</P>
<P>
   Check the broker's performance at making trades.
</P>
<P>
   ``If their systems get bogged down and don't process your orders
quickly, that can hurt you,'' said Dan Dubay, a certified financial
planner and a principal in PPA Advisory Services in Roswell.
</P>
<P>
   The accompanying chart shows Web sites that can help you check
out this and other factors.
</P>
<P>
   Ask what research capacity the broker will supply.
</P>
<P>
   Dubay advises asking whether the broker will give you access to
outside research reports as well as its own.
</P>
<P>
   Decide exactly what services you need.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 175 online brokers now, according to some
counts. As competition increases, consumers get access to more
varied services. Some offer advice as well as research. Some will
provide access to professional advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Hartz said she picked Schwab not because of its transaction
prices but for the services it offers. She was attracted by free
switching among numerous mutual funds and consolidated statements,
as well as other things.
</P>
<P>
   Consider keeping one foot in the real world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find that people usually do some things online and other
things offline,'' said Tracey Curvey, Fidelity's executive vice
president for online investments. ``Most people still like talking
to a phone representative or walking into an investment center.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask about the broker's insurance.
</P>
<P>
   You're looking for protection in case the brokerage goes under,
said Dubay. In general, he suggested sticking with major
brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   The largest online brokers, ranked by assets at the end of 1999,
are Schwab, ETrade, TD Waterhouse, Fidelity, Datek, Ameritrade, DLJ
Direct, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Cybercorp and Suretrade. The
list was prepared by U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget investment costs.
</P>
<P>
   This is not overwhelmingly important for people who invest for
the long term, rather than trading for quick profits.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Dubay points out, a broker might have competitive prices
on large transactions but relatively high charges for buying 100 or
200 shares. ``You need to compare pricing on whatever kind of
transactions you're doing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Test drive the broker's Web site. If it's hard to use, you
probably won't want to use it.

 &HT;    A magic fern brings the past to the present
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ The biggest asparagus fern I've ever seen
lived in a gigantic terra cotta pot on my grandmother's front porch
in Jacksonville. For as many years as I knew her, which were too
few I'm thinking now, that fern welcomed visitors to the row of
rocking chairs she shared with friends and family. It even had a
name _ Bessie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Has anyone fed Bessie this morning?'' Grandmother would ask
over grits and eggs. We all were expected to lend a hand in
Bessie's care and feeding _ even first time visitors were
instructed. ``Egg water's in the pantry,'' she'd say pointing
toward the small room between the dining room and the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Mrs. Parker stored her magic fern formula, the
``tea'' that grew Bessie to such gargantuan proportions that
perfect strangers would step up onto the porch to admire her and
ask Grandmother how she did it. She liked that. She was happy to
share her secret which was nothing more than a crock filled with
egg shells, coffee grounds, and enough water for steeping. That's
what did it _ that's what kept Bessie green and springy when her
kin on porches up and down Herschel Street lorida summertime.
</P>
<P>
   Feeding Bessie could have been my full-time job since I was the
only grandchild until I was seven and my cousin Malcolm was born,
but I was afraid of the pantry because a house spider the size of a
salad plate lived in there _ unmolested. Mrs. Parker had kind of
taken a fancy to the bug. She'd even named him _ Junior.
</P>
<P>
   Junior was protected like he was some kind of an endangered
species _ which he definitely was not because I'd seen his brothers
and sisters around _ and even Grandmother's house cats knew better
than to take a passing swipe at the family bug.
</P>
<P>
   Only once did I forget and walk through Junior's condo _ and I
saw his arachnid-y eyeballs watching me. After that, if I wanted a
between-meal handout, I went out the front door, down the sandy
drive to the back of the house, around the corner past the wash
house, and up the steps to the latticed kitchen porch. Grandmother
thought I was pretty silly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't hurt you,'' she'd remind me, her patience wearing
thin at my childish histrionics. I didn't know how to tell her that
I wasn't afraid of being bitten, I just didn't want to be uglied to
death.
</P>
<P>
   Afternoons, after I'd been cleaned up from the day's play, Mrs.
Parker would invite me to join the grownups on the porch for iced
tea. While the big folks rocked and fanned themselves with
cardboard fans on a stick from Seashole's funeral home, I'd sit on
the floor next to the fern, running my hand along the branches,
feeling the soft needles against my palm.
</P>
<P>
   Grandmother promised that when I grew up and married and had a
porch of my own, she'd give me Bessie to keep. Sometimes I'd think
about that on the long summer evenings after I'd been tucked in
between the seersucker summer sheets on the upstairs sleeping porch
off Grandaddy's room. I didn't know who, but I knew I had to marry
someone, if Bessie was to be mine.
</P>
<P>
   Long before I was of marrying age, Bessie, Junior, the house on
Herschel Street, and Grandmother Parker were gone. I wish I had
known them all better.
</P>
<P>
   Now I have a house _ an old house with a front porch swing and
rockers, and an asparagus fern in a green pot over in the corner,
out of the sun. I'm thinking about brewing up some ``tea'' for it,
but I know there'll never be another gloriously perfect Bessie.

   OLYMPICS-SYDNEY _ SYDNEY, Australia _ It's Friday night, and the
musky aroma of Australian manhood saturates the Oaks, a pub on the
north side of Sydney Harbour that's as big as a Wal-Mart. Mobs of
men are standing around talking rugby over schooners of beer. Some
are furiously working the slot machines everyone calls ``pokies.''
Others are charring slabs of meat on a barbecue pit out in the
courtyard. There's something odd about the round table by the door.
Not only does it include several women _ eating pizza no less _ but
some of their accents sound rather alien. ``I remember when I left
Atlanta,'' one of them says, ``my mover asked, `What's the deal
with Sydney? It seems like we've been moving everyone to Sydney.'''
The deal with Sydney, of course, is the Olympics. Four years ago
tonight, Muhammad Ali lit the caldron that signaled Atlanta's star
turn on the world stage. For some Atlantans, it wasn't enough. At
least 200 veterans of the 1996 Games have moved on to Australia to
be part of the first Olympics of the new millennium. (Auchmutey,

   COXNET WHEELS 0718 _ Although the 2000 Isuzu Rodeo is a quite
civilized sport-utility vehicle, it will issue reminders that Isuzu
is a truck manufacturer and not a carmaker. The ride is noticeably
trucklike, and not even Isuzu's Intelligent Suspension Control
system (ISC) prevents that. (DeVault, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   OLYMPICS-SYDNEY _ SYDNEY, Australia _ It's Friday night, and the
musky aroma of Australian manhood saturates the Oaks, a pub on the
north side of Sydney Harbour that's as big as a Wal-Mart. Mobs of
men are standing around talking rugby over schooners of beer. Some
are furiously working the slot machines everyone calls ``pokies.''
Others are charring slabs of meat on a barbecue pit out in the
courtyard. There's something odd about the round table by the door.
Not only does it include several women _ eating pizza no less _ but
some of their accents sound rather alien. ``I remember when I left
Atlanta,'' one of them says, ``my mover asked, `What's the deal
with Sydney? It seems like we've been moving everyone to Sydney.'''
The deal with Sydney, of course, is the Olympics. Four years ago
tonight, Muhammad Ali lit the caldron that signaled Atlanta's star
turn on the world stage. For some Atlantans, it wasn't enough. At
least 200 veterans of the 1996 Games have moved on to Australia to
be part of the first Olympics of the new millennium. (Auchmutey,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 34.

student.'' (Kalajian, Palm beach Post). 70. WITH ART.

   DEMERIT BADGE
</P>
<P>
   Q: My son has been a Cub Scout for three years, and I've been a
den leader for one, a wonderful experience for us both. But I was
appalled by the Supreme Court's decision upholding the Scouts'
right to exclude gay people. I cannot feel proud to see my son
wearing a uniform that represents bigotry, and so we are
withdrawing from the Scouts. Many of my friends also oppose this
discrimination but plan to continue in Scouting anyway. Aren't they
wrong to do so?
</P>
<P>
   _ Lynn Winter, Port Washington, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A: Resigning as you did is the ethical thing to do. Just as one
is honor bound to quit an organization that excludes
African-Americans, so you should withdraw from Scouting as long as
it rejects homosexuals. That Scouting has a legal right of free
association does not clear you of this obligation. The right to
shun Jews is no less anti-Semitic for all its legality.
</P>
<P>
   Those who remain in the Scouts are on shaky ground even if they
sincerely seek reform from within. That is a reasonable strategy
while the issue is unsettled, but once the Supreme Court handed
down its decision, the debate ended. To stay now is to accept _ if
not endorse _ its policy. You need not agree with an organization's
every principle, of course, but the matter in this case is too
fundamental _ and too cruel _ to tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, all too often those who remain are not actually
fighting from within; they're going on camping trips from within.
Were you to find yourself transported to 1952, there would be no
honor in lamenting Jim Crow and then sitting down at a segregated
lunch counter and ordering a tuna sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   Resigning need not mean giving up the struggle. Ex-Scouts can
write letters, rally support and seek to reform Scouting, to rejoin
one day.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, there are other, more tolerant, youth groups.
The Girl Scouts and the Boys and Girls Clubs of America have no
similar homophobic policies; neither do many foreign scouting
organizations. Scouts Canada, for instance, is particularly humane,
not only rejecting sexual orientation as a criterion for membership
but also authorizing specialized troops, including ones for
Mormons, Cantonese-speakers and gay Scouts. Any chance of your
becoming the first Long Island outpost for Canadian scouting?
</P>
<P>
   Q: A male friend occasionally goes to ethics society meetings
where high-minded topics are discussed. He also has an ulterior
motive: he wants to meet women, which he can do at the informal
receptions afterward. He appears to be chasing skirts in a chaste
setting. Is this ethical?
</P>
<P>
   _ F.K., Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   A: This behavior is not merely acceptable; it is admirable. Love
and its neighbor, desire, are hardly unethical; they're two of
life's pleasures. Your friend seems to be trying to increase the
sum of human happiness.
</P>
<P>
   People have multiple reasons for everything they do. For
example, attending church has been not just a spiritual but also a
courtship opportunity for hundreds of years. As long as your friend
isn't disrupting the discussion or pestering anyone with unwanted
advances, I applaud his efforts. In fact, if I were establishing an
ethics society, our slogan would be ``You'll come for the
high-minded discourse, but you'll stay for the pulse-quickening
romance.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I went to donate blood, I found myself answering yes to
several screening questions. An example: ``Have you (a man) had sex
with a man since 1979? Have you traveled to Britain since 1995?'' I
have a fair amount of medical training (I will receive my M.D.
shortly), so I know the implications of these questions _ and I
also know that my donation, which was rejected, presented no risk.
Would it have been wrong to tell a few white lies for the greater
good of contributing to the blood supply?
</P>
<P>
   _ D.S., Providence, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   A: It would have been wrong. You must answer honestly. Remember,
your blood alone is not the only issue here. The integrity of the
screening process would be compromised were it known that donors
lie whenever they feel confident about the safety of their blood or
the excellence of their med-school learning.
</P>
<P>
   Besides securing the current blood supply, accurate information
is necessary to develop future screening methods. Take the screen
for the predominantly transfusion-borne hepatitis C, for example,
which has been in place only since 1992. ``Much of what was learned
was gleaned from retrospective analysis of donor demographics,''
says Dr. Serena Yoon, an attending physician at Cayuga Medical
Center and senior clinical instructor at the University of
Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, even if your blood is unacceptable for
transfusion, it may still be valuable. Some agencies accept blood
from people with certain risk factors and use it for research. So
fill out the questionnaire accurately, and let the collection
service decide how best to use your blood.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Recently, I was in a pizzeria where a pizza maker sneezed
into his hands and, without washing them, continued to make the
pie. Besides deciding never to eat there again and hoping every
other pizza maker is more fastidious, did I have an obligation to
confront him about his toppings?
</P>
<P>
   _ A.O., New York
</P>
<P>
   A: Absolutely! Yuck! You should have said something to the pizza
maker or the manager, otherwise someone will end up eating what is
not so much a pizza as a pepperoni hanky.

 &HT;    CHINESE PROVINCE CRACKS DOWN ON CHEATING HUSBANDS, AND THEIR
CONCUBINES

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ In the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, just
over the border from high-flying Hong Kong, there's a saying: If a
man doesn't keep a concubine, he's not successful.
</P>
<P>
   Well, there are a lot of successful men in Guangdong. So
successful, in fact, some men have acquired not only a second
``wife,'' they have even a third or a fourth. It's called bao ernai
in Chinese, or taking a second wife. And like the concubines of
traditional China, she gets money, gifts and usually even a house
to live in from her married lover. She often even bears him
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Guangdong, the bao ernai phenomenon has reached the point
where we can no longer ignore it,'' Cui Shuhui, an official of the
state-run All-China Women's Federation recently told the Yangcheng
Evening News, a Guangdong newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has become so serious, local law enforcement could
no longer wait for China's outdated divorce laws to catch up. So
last month, four provincial law-enforcement and judicial agencies
jointly issued a legal ``opinion'' _ which they claim has the
weight of law _ that makes it easier for women to divorce husbands
who bao ernai.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion entitles the wife to half of everything her husband
has bought for his mistress, even if the item, such as a house, car
or stocks, is in the other woman's name. If the wife has no hard
evidence that her husband has been cheating, the opinion allows
police to help her obtain it.
</P>
<P>
   Local women's groups that had been demanding something be done
to protect the financial interests of wives are over-joyed. Since
the legal opinion was announced, the phones at local offices of the
All-China Women's Federation, which operates at all levels of
government, have been ringing off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   The Yangcheng Evening News called the opinion a ``huge bomb.''
One reporter wrote that in two days of interviewing women, the
phrase he heard most often was: ``I was so excited I couldn't sleep
all night.''
</P>
<P>
   The Guangdong opinion comes just as the communist National
People's Congress, China's legislature, is in the midst of debating
a badly-needed revision of the marriage law. Chinese society has
seen huge changes since the law was last updated in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Divorce rates have more than tripled; domestic violence has
increased; and marriages now are based more on individuals'
feelings rather than the old standard of political or familial
ties. The current law gives few guidelines on how to handle issues
such as support payments, splitting assets and custody of children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision to amend the law comes at a time when Chinese
society is increasingly troubled by such social problems as
proliferating concubinage and worsening family violence,'' said
Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency.
</P>
<P>
   The divorce rate was just 3 percent in 1980 but has climbed to
13 percent. In large cities, such as Beijing and Shanghai, it is
well over 25 percent. A 1998 survey in Shanghai found that 36
percent of divorces were due to incompatibility and 22 percent to
extramarital affairs, according to Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Prof. Lu Ying, who teaches marriage and family law at Zhongshan
University in Guangzhou, the provincial capital of Guangdong, said
women often lose out in divorce becausons also. In Shanghai it's
called ``keeping a golden canary,'' that is, a lovely, frail
creature who lives in a cage and comes out only when you take it
out. In Beijing, she's called a ``little honey.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a status symbol,'' said Liu Donghua, a lawyer at the
Center for Women's Law Studies &AMP; Legal Services of Beijing
University. ``Men think, 'Everyone else is doing it,' so they just
copy.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 percent of cases at the non-profit law center are
for divorce. Of those, almost one-fifth involve extra-marital
relations. To be sure, cases of adulterous women are numerous also
but are vastly outnumbered by philandering husbands. Some men even
bring their mistresses home, Liu said, forcing wife and concubine
to live under one roof.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the Guangdong opinion doesn't go far enough. Liu, for
example, believes that not only should the husband be made to pay
compensation, so should the other woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The third party has to take responsibility for destroying a
family,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other legal experts in China believe that would be allowing the
law to go too far into the moral realm. Even allowing police to
help gather evidence of adultery, as the Guangdong opinion does,
opens personal lives up to dangerous abuses of police power, says
sociologist Li Yinhe, a researcher at the state-run Chinese Academy
of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Such disputes have been dividing feminists since a revision of
the marriage law was first proposed in 1995. Passage this year is
unlikely, experts say.

<TEXT>
<P>
   His entrance to the company Christmas party was carefully timed
so that he was the last to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   From his red silk top hat to his patent leather shoes with red
and green Christmas bells affixed to the toes, he was a cross
between a finely adorned peacock and a male recruited to dance with
the Rocketts.
</P>
<P>
   As his lips lightly touched the outstretched hands of more than
one willing female, he gave a seductive wink that would have made
even Clark Gable seem dull and boring.
</P>
<P>
   Flamboyantly throwing the scarlet lined cape over his shoulder
made him the focus of attention. The ensuing hush of the crowd
seemed to excite and encourage him further while he theatrically
spoke several memorized lines in French.
</P>
<P>
   Any reciprocal display of attention and affection by the women
at the party was perceived by him as coming from passionately
starved potential mistresses.
</P>
<P>
   This was not a once-a-year performance designed to entertain
co-workers but instead a pervasive lifestyle with a Christmas
theme.
</P>
<P>
   Men and women with histrionic personality disorders live in an
exaggerated emotional world demanding attention to give meaning to
their lives. Going beyond mere flamboyance and a flair for the
dramatic, those with histrionic personality disorders live as if
they were always on center stage. Often seen as ``fake'' or
``shallow,'' they experience a blur between fantasy and reality
when under stress.
</P>
<P>
   The diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders
describes the histrionic personality disorder in the following
manner: A pervasive pattern of excessive emotionality and attention
seeking, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of
contexts, as indicated by eight (or more) of the following:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  They are uncomfortable in situations when not the center of
attention.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Their interaction with others is often characterized by
inappropriate, sexually seductive or provocative behavior.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  They are prone to exhibit shallow expressions of emotion which
shift rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  They often use physical appearance to get attention.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Their style of speech is frequently impressionistic and
shallow.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  They display self-dramatization, theatricality, and
exaggerated expression of emotion.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  They are very suggestible and easily influenced by others or
situations.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  They often over estimate intimacy in relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Although difficult to effectively treat, psychotherapy is
usually the treatment of choice. An excellent resource for
understanding more about and treating this disorder are: The New
Personality Self-Portrait: Why You Think, Work, Love and Act the
Way You Do by John M. Oldman and Lois B. Morris, Bantam Books,

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By LISA FUGARD  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    If birders go birding then those who seek out wildflowers surely
go flowering; the term botanizing doesn't begin to capture the
sweet delight I experienced on discovering the profusion of
wildflowers growing in the Burren in County Clare on Ireland's west
coast.
 &HT;    My romance with bird's-foot trefoil, mountain avens and herb
Robert came about by accident. When I flew into Shannon last July
and met my mother, Sheila, for a 10-day holiday, it was with the
intention of viewing shore birds and, with luck, a few seals.
 &HT;    Bleak and harsh are the adjectives often used to describe the
Burren, a roughly 100-square-mile limestone landscape of cliffs,
stony hills and broad stretches of rock resembling pavement. I have
an affinity for such landscapes, as does my mother, and the
boireann, the Irish word for rocky place, did not disappoint us.
 &HT;    Two and a half hours after leaving the airport in a
sardine-can-sized rental car, well suited to skinny country roads,
we crested a hill just above a stretch of coastline called Pol
Salach and saw a stunning panorama of fierce Ireland _ shattered
terraces of stark limestone spilling into a sea that was gray as
elephant skin.
 &HT;    We followed the coast road through the lonely village of Fanore
where horses grazed in rock-strewn pastures next to the beach, past
Black Head where the limestone cliffs plunged into the sea. Masses
of oxeye daisies and fuchsias blooming on the side of the road
softened the austere beauty of the rock.
 &HT;    By the time we reached Ballyvaughan, a tiny village sitting on a
tranquil corner of Galway Bay, we were enamored of the Burren.
Smoked salmon and mussels at Monk's Bar on the quay and two elegant
bedrooms in Rusheen Lodge, a four-star guest house, only added to
our satisfaction.
 &HT;    The next morning we drove into the hills behind Ballyvaughan
where flinty stone walls divided the land into pastures. I was
itching to walk among the rocks, but in planning the trip I had
promised my mother a ruin a day. My passion for the natural world
is matched by her passion for mosques, temples, tombs and ruined
churches. Such churches abound in the Burren, as do ring forts and
Neolithic tombs.
 &HT;    Our first visit was to the village of Kilfenora where the
tiniest medieval cathedral awaited us. The nave or front section is
still used for church services while the roofless chancel radiates
stillness and mystery. Two identical stone carvings _ apparently
the head of a bishop _ have a vaguely Egyptian air about them.
 &HT;    A delicate trefoil sedilia _ three seats crowned with a
beautifully carved pinnacle _ is recessed into one wall, while on
the adjacent wall are two naively incised 13th- and 14th-century
stone carvings.
 &HT;    One of them, supposedly of a cleric, had us perplexed. What did
the oval head and elongated neck remind us of? Where had we seen
that serene, otherworldly demeanor?
 &HT;    My mother, who is half Irish and has a streak of sly Irish wit
about her, solved that mystery when she exclaimed ``The Holy
Alien!''
 &HT;    Pelting rain and sudden squalls, rain that drizzles and mizzles
_ Ireland is one of the few countries where such weather is
shrugged off, hardly a deterrent to wildflower adventures.
 &HT;    After lunch I dropped my mother back at the B&AMP;B and, armed with
``Wild Plants of the Burren and the Aran Islands,'' bought at the
Burren Interpretive Center at Kilfenora, and a large umbrella
(which immediately marked me as a foreigner and a sissy), I drove
40 minutes along the coast road to rocky Pol Salach for my first
afternoon of flowering.
 &HT;    The great mystique of the flora of the Burren lies in its
diversity and its growing habits _ Mediterranean and arctic-alpine
plants thrive side by side. None of the species are unique to the
Burren, but many grow in the limestone landscape in greater
abundance than anywhere else in Ireland or Britain.
 &HT;    I parked the car, climbed over a low stone wall and crouched on
the ground. Crushing wild thyme between my fingers, I breathed
deep. I'd identified my first wildflower. And what were the tiny
white flowers intertwined with the thyme? I thumbed through my
flower book.
 &HT;    Yes! It was squinancy wort. After half an hour of literally
crawling through a cow pasture so ablaze with flowers it seemed as
though a beneficent fairy artist had dipped her paintbrush in
magenta, blue, yellow, cream and periwinkle blue and flicked it
over the ground, I reached the limestone pavement.
 &HT;    Smooth, relatively flat, rectangular chunks of limestone called
clints are separated from one another by fissures that range in
depth from one foot to 20. It's in these fissures, or grikes, that
the pluckiest of plants flourish. The magenta flowers of bloody
cranesbill swayed brightly against the bone-colored rock, and I saw
honeysuck le plants twisted into bonsais by the strong winds.
 &HT;    Closer to the sea cliffs I found those plants that thrive in the
salty spray gusting off Galway Bay _ bobbing heads of pink thrift
and sea campion and thick seaweedy-looking ferns that glistened in
the grikes. Of course, there were plants that I couldn't identify.
 &HT;    There are over 600 species recorded in the Burren. The book I
carried listed 120. I was momentarily frustrated. Then smiled. My
naming them didn't bring the flowers into being. Why not simply
enjoy them?
 &HT;    Our love affair with the Burren was now well under way, and the
following day while driving to Corcomroe, a Cistercian abbey that
lies five miles east of Ballyvaughan, my mother fantasized about
buying property. We parked at the end of a country lane and
immediately registered an eerie sound that seemed to be rising from
the ruined abbey. A ham-fisted ghost stumbling over the bass keys
of an organ?
 &HT;    After some investigation the Organist of Corcomroe, as he is now
affectionately remembered by my mother and me, turned out to be a
most handsome blond bull lowing to several docile black-and-white
cows cloistered in a field on the opposite side of the road.
 &HT;    While Kilfenora's chancel is exquisitely intimate, Corcomroe,
with the wind gusting through it, feels lonely and desolate. It
also has a stunning roof, as do most of the churches we visited,
with a wide swath of changeable Irish sky through which the rooks
wheeled and cawed. On some of the pillars the traces of carvings of
flowers can be found, a stony reminder of the abbey's other name,
Our Lady of the Fertile Rocks.
 &HT;    In one corner there is a recumbent effigy said to be that of an
O'Brien king killed nearby in 1267. Above it is an unfinished
14th-century carving, presumably of the abbot of Corcomroe. With a
hint of a smile on his face and rather puffy attire, he looks as
though he's levitating up the ruined chancel.
 &HT;    ``Three days is not enough time to explore the Burren,'' I
lamented over dinner that night in the superb Whitethorn
restaurant.
 &HT;    Reservations in Connemara awaited us, so the following day we
left for County Galway. On our way we stopped at Thoor Ballylee
near the town of Gort _ less than an hour's drive from Ballyvaughan
_ where Yeats summered from 1917 to 1929. The recorded commentary
issuing from speakers in his dining room, study and bedroom didn't
interest me so I climbed higher.
 &HT;    Close to the top of the stone tower I found what was surely the
true spirit of Yeats _ a soft-feathered, fierce-eyed kestrel
guarding her chick on a nest of sticks.
 &HT;    After two days in Connemara, during which time the sun blazed 16
hours a day and I swam in the stillest, bluest bay I'd ever seen,
gray clouds rolled in from the ocean. Rain spattered on the window
of our hotel. ``Only one place to be in such moody weather,'' I
said to my mother. Back to the Burren we raced.
 &HT;    Rusheen Lodge had been lovely, but I always feel as though I'm
staying in my grandparents' house when I visit a B &AMP; B. That
evening we checked into the Ballinalacken Castle Hotel, a sprawling
country house sitting on a hill just below a 15th-century O'Brien
tower house. The ruin is now roped off because too many visitors
were leaving with chunks of genuine Irish castle in their pockets.
 &HT;    We felt like Burren old-timers, and our remaining days took on
an easy routine. In the mornings we visited churches, castles and
towers. There was Dysert O'Dea, where a bizarre array of
Romanesque-style animal and human heads arches over the south
doorway of the church.
 &HT;    Lemaneagh Castle, worthy of at least a few ghosts, stands proud
in a stretch of windswept farmland (equally creepy was the electric
fence surrounding the field and the old Irish codger who scowled at
the few cars parked just beyond his land).
 &HT;    In Killinaboy we came across a humble ruined church with a
simple carving of the Crucifixion and the weathered Sheila na gig,
an ancient fertility symbol, above the entrance.
 &HT;    Each afternoon I went flowering. A walk up the Kyber Pass, a
road in Fanore that follows the Caher River _ the only surface
river in the Burren, as most of the rainwater seeps into the
underground waterways _ will be remembered as the afternoon I
discovered orchids.
 &HT;    Except for the exquisite bee orchid, the terrestrial species of
the Burren are not as showy as tropical orchids that cling to
trees. Still, I was captivated by their demure beauty.
 &HT;    On another day I went mad for ferns. I kept meaning to hike one
of the ancient green roads that lace the Burren; they're noted for
the wildflowers but I was smitten with rock, with the way a
saucer-sized depression on a boulder could hold an array of small
flowers brilliant as jewels, the way the wind gusting off Galway
Bay tossed the tousled pink flowers of hemp agrimony, a species
that grew en masse in the limestone fissures.
 &HT;    And then there was the food _ lobsters, crabs, black sole,
salmon, mussels. We feasted every evening at local restaurants and
returned to our hotel _ my mother had renamed it Fawlty Castle in
honor of the quirky yet utterly charming staff _ in time for sunset
tea, which, in early July, was at about 9 p.m.
 &HT;    On our last morning in the Burren I wandered the pavement at Pol
Salach, saying goodbye to yet another part of the world I'd fallen
in love with. My evening reading had been from a chapter in ``The
Burren: A Companion to the Wildflowers of an Irish Limestone
Wilderness'' that touched on the historical use of many of the
plants Id been rhapsodizing over, and as I whispered the names of
the flowers surrounding me, I felt as though I were floating back
in time.
 &HT;    Lady's bedstraw _ makes good bedding and can be used as a rennet
plant for curdling milk; squinancy wort _ useful if I ever get an
attack of quinsy; carline thistle _ preserve the buds with honey
and sugar for a tasty sweetmeat; Burnet rose _ I'll drink a syrup
made from the rosehips if I'm coughing, spitting blood or stricken
with scurvy.
 &HT;    The monks of Corcomroe must have put many of these plants to
medicinal use. Perhaps the levitating abbot secretly snacked on
carline thistles.
 &HT;    As for the Holy Alien? That otherworldly, rather blissful
demeanor might have come about from one too many afternoons spent
flowering.
 &HT;    -----
 SIDEBAR: REVELING IN BIRD'S-FOOT TREFOIL, SQUINANCY WORT AND
THRIFT  
 LODGING  
 &HT;    Rusheen Lodge. Just outside the village of Ballyvaughan, this
four-star guest house has six lovely, spacious rooms with private
bathrooms, and two suites. Doubles are $72; the suites $108, full
breakfast included, calculated at $1.21 to the Irish pound.
Telephone (353-65) 70 77092, fax (353-65) 70 77152.
 &HT;    Ballinalacken Castle Hotel. We loved this creaky yet elegant
hotel on the outskirts of Lisdoonvarna. Drinking tea in the sitting
room and sprawling about our spacious, rather oddly but grandly
decorated room made us feel like fading aristocrats. Some rooms
have splendid views of the Aran Islands, while others (nos. 5, 6,
10 and 11) do not. Doubles are $48 to $54, with full Irish
breakfast. For reservations, telephone or fax (353-65) 70 74025.
 DINING  
 &HT;    Sheedy's Hotel and Restaurant. What this restaurant in
Lisdoonvarna lacks in decor it makes up for with superb food. I had
an entree of black sole so exquisite I wonder if I'll ever eat fish
that fresh again. A three-course dinner for two, excluding drinks,
averages $60. Sheedy's bar has a seafood menu. Telephone (353-65)
70 74026.
 &HT;    The Whitethorn. Situated a half mile east of Ballyvaughan on the
coast road to Galway, this elegant restaurant has a stunning view
of Galway Bay. Dinner for two averages $70 and is served Friday and
Saturday nights only in July and August. Weekends and weekdays the
lunch service is buffet style and the food is just as delicious.
 &HT;    Attached is a shop crammed with good clothing, Irish crafts and
all the guidebooks needed to explore the Burren. Telephone (353-5)
70 77044.
 INFORMATION  
 &HT;    The Burren Interpretive Center at Kilfe nora, the first such
center in Ireland, has models and exhibits explaining the geology,
flora and fauna of the Burren, as well as an audiovisual lecture of
the area. Open daily 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. through September (to 5
p.m. October to May). Telephone (353-65) 70 88030. Admission $3.
 &HT;    Recommended reading: ``The Burren: a Companion to the
Wildflowers of an Irish Limestone Wilderness'' (Collins Press), by
E. Charles Nelson, who is utterly bewitched by the Burren. For help
in identifying flowers, pick up a copy of ``Wild Plants of the
Burren and the Aran Islands,'' also by E. Charles Nelson. Both
books are available at the Whitethorn and the Burren Interpretive
Center at Kilfenora.

SHOPPING AROUND: APRIL IN PARIS? WHY NOT?

 (Color slide included.) 
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Autumn may be the most delightful time to visit Paris, Rome and
many other European destinations. After all, most of the tourists
have gone home, museums have shorter lines and the weather can be
the best of the year.
 &HT;    Hotel prices, however, may not be that much lower than they are
in July and August because September and October are becoming
increasingly popular months to travel. But come late October,
prices do indeed fall.
 &HT;    For those considering a European getaway this autumn, here are
some planning tools.
 AIRFARES &AMP; PACKAGES  
 &HT;    Those who simply want a good, cheap airfare should look to
Expedia.com (www.expedia.com), Travelocity.com
(www.travelocity.com) and LowestFare.com (www.lowestfare.com),
which offer fare finders for thrifty travelers.
 &HT;    Another way to save money is with package deals that include
round-trip airfare, accommodations and transfers _ all for a single
price. Major American and European air carriers offer various
packages to Europe, but two carriers with extensive offerings are
British Airways (Holiday Desk, 75-20 Astoria Blvd., Jackson
Heights, NY 11370; 877-428-2228; www.britishairways.com) and
American Airlines (P.O. Box 619688, DFW Airport, Texas 75261;
800-882-8880; www.aa.com).
 &HT;    Package prices are fixed, and they're frequently available with
as little as seven days' advance notice. The best ones offer a
range of hotel choices, satisfying both budget-minded travelers and
those who want to splash out a little.
 ESCORTED TOURS  
 &HT;    For a single price, escorted tours provide airfare, hotel
accommodations, transfers, transportation as well as most meals,
sightseeing, baggage handling and taxes.
 &HT;    Fortunately, most tour companies no longer try to cram seven
countries into seven days. The smarter ones are tailoring their
trips to people who were brought up traveling independently.
 &HT;    The price can be right, because an escorted tour almost always
costs less than pricing components separately and it comes with the
added benefit of service.
 &HT;    Dozens of companies offer such tours to France, Spain and
virtually every country in Western and Eastern Europe. Travelers
can narrow their search by contacting the United States Tour
Operator Association (342 Madison Ave., Suite 1522, New York, NY
10173; 212-599-6599; www.ustoa.com).
 TRAINS  
 &HT;    Getting around Europe by train is easy. And the easiest way to
research European rail schedules and prices is to contact Rail
Europe (44 South Broadway, White Plains, NY 10601; 800-4-EURAIL;
www.raileurope.com), which also includes Brit Rail.
 &HT;    With a little work, smart travelers can determine whether it's
cheaper to buy point-to-point tickets or to go for a railpass _ or
perhaps decide that a rental car might be even cheaper if there are
enough people traveling together.
 &HT;    A basic Eurailpass costs $554 and provides 15 consecutive days
of unlimited first-class travel in the 17 member countries:
Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,
Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal,
Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.
 &HT;    But Rail Europe offers an array of regional and national passes,
in both first- and second-class versions. Many passes also come in
flexi-pass versions, since many travelers won't travel on every day
of their vacation.
 &HT;    A German Flexipass, for example, permits four days of travel in
a one-month period, for $252 in first class and $174 in second.
 &HT;    There are also passes that save two travelers money, like the
Swiss Saver Flexipass. It's $198 in first class and $132 in second
class, per person, for two travelers. They get three days of travel
within one month. Single travelers pay $234 and $156, respectively,
for these same passes.
 &HT;    Regional passes, such as the Europass, link France, Germany,
Italy, Spain and Switzerland. Rail Europe also offers a variety of
Eurostar tickets, for travel on the high-speed train between
Brussels, London and Paris.
 RENTALS  
 &HT;    Renting a European house or apartment for a week or more is
often an affordable way to go. That's true for a London apartment,
a Swiss chalet or a French villa.
 &HT;    Most renters will find that they get more space for their money,
even in a studio apartment, than at a comparable hotel.
 &HT;    Small homes and larger villas are suitable for families or
couples traveling together. In fact, when families or couples pool
their finances, renting can be a true cost-saver.
 &HT;    When looking for a rental, choose a property by location as well
as size and amenities. These companies offer a wide range of
European rentals:
 &HT;     The French Experience  (370 Lexington Ave., Suite 812, New
York, NY 10017; 212-986-3800; www.frenchexperience.com) has long
specialized in ``gites,'' rural vacation homes throughout the
French countryside.
 &HT;     Homes Away  (34 Park Road, Toronto M4W 2N4, Ontario, Canada;
800-374-6637; www.homesaway.com) has a handful of upscale rentals
in the most desirable areas of France and Italy.
 &HT;     The Landmark Trust  (707 Kipling Road, Dummerston, VT 05301;
802-254-6868; www.landmarktrust.co.uk) has a selection of unusual
rentals in period buildings throughout the British Isles.
 &HT;     Paris Sejours Reservations  (875 N. Michigan Ave., Suite 3214,
Chicago, IL 60611; 312-587-7707; www.PSRyourhomeinParis.com)
focuses on Paris apartments, from studios on up.
 &HT;     The Parker Company  (Seaport Landing, 152 Lynnway, Lynn, MA
01902; 800-280-2811; www.parkercompany.com) specializes in Italy.
 &HT;     WIMCO  (P.O. Box 1461, Newport, RI 02840; 800-932-3222;
www.wimcovillas.com) offers rentals in England, France, Ireland,
Italy and Scotland.

WHAT'S DOING IN PHILADELPHIA

 (Color slides and B&AMP;W map available.) 
 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By LAURA MANSNERUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Philadelphia has done everything it could think of for the
45,000 visitors expected at the Republican National Convention: its
landmark architecture is polished, its streetscapes groomed, its
hotels gleaming with restored marble and brass and stocked with
concierges.
 &HT;    But the convention is brief (July 31 through Aug. 3) and the
summer is long, making for many more weeks of prime tourism in the
nation's original convention city.
 &HT;    When you're inviting the whole country, it's good to have a city
full of walking opportunities. While the convention site, the First
Union Center, is in deep South Philadelphia, the restaurants,
shopping and historic sites are clustered in mercifully compact
Center City, a 15-minute subway or cab ride away.
 &HT;    There, in the two-mile stretch between rivers, the spines of
skyscrapers give way quickly to narrow, leafy residential streets
that make life easy for walkers, if not for traffic. A tourist
could spend a day just inspecting the courtyards and mews,
especially plentiful in the old neighborhoods east of Broad Street.
 &HT;    Philadelphia in summer is still the hot, placid city where
street life means corner taverns with open doors and row-house
stoops occupied by supervising grandparents. But with the dizzying
revival of Center City, another public life _ the kind involving
theater tickets and cell phones _ brings people out.
 &HT;    High summer is also the time to set sandals to the streets
around Independence Hall and see where the delegates to the First
and Second Continental Congresses sweltered. Or to explore the cool
halls of museums that have given their all to this summer's
exhibitions. Or to visit the rivers: the Delaware, with its night
life on the piers, and the more sedate Schuylkill, where the grassy
banks invite picnics and jogging.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    The city will greet the convention on its eve, July 30, with a
parade of 59 lighted boats at 9 p.m. and fireworks along the
Delaware. Penn's Landing and the New Jersey State Aquarium in
Camden are prime viewing spots. Information: (800) 770-5883.
 &HT;    You don't have to be a GOP delegate to get into PoliticalFest,
described as a world's fair of politics. It will have historical
and interactive (want to read from a teleprompter?) exhibits at the
Pennsylvania Convention Center, 12th and Arch Streets, July 26
through Aug. 3. Admission: $10 and $5 for students, ages 4 to 11
and 65 and older; (215) 686-0350.
 &HT;    And at the Atwater Kent Museum, 15 South Seventh St., the
exhibit ``Vote: Campaign Choices/Presidential Voices'' is showing
two centuries of campaign memorabilia until Nov. 26. Admission to
the Atwater Kent, Philadelphia's history museum, is $3, $2 for ages
55 and older and $1.50 for children 3 to 12. Information: (215)
922-3031.
 &HT;    The African American Museum in Philadelphia, 701 Arch St., (215)
574-0380, is celebrating the blues all summer. In addition to a
photography exhibition, through Sept. 3, the museum plans outdoor
lunch concerts on Wednesdays in July and August, with hip-hop,
zydeco and classical music represented, too. A second exhibit,
through Sept. 17, celebrates Paul Robeson. Admission: $6, $4 for
students, those aged 55 and older and the handicapped.
 &HT;    ``Andy Warhol: Social Observer'' is at the museum of the
Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Broad and Cherry Streets, (215)
972-7600, through Sept. 21. The show, including paintings of
Presidents Reagan and Nixon, Chairman Mao and Lenin, is the first
major exhibition of Warhol's work since 1988. Admission is $8, $7
for students and ages 60 and up, and $5 for ages 5 to 18.
 &HT;    On the streets or in the galleries, plastic cups of wine in
hand, people gather in Old City, just northeast of the Liberty
Bell, on First Fridays. This month, an extra Friday, July 28, will
accommodate convention visitors at the sprawling open house. About
40 art galleries, on Second and Third Streets, will open from 5
till 9 p.m. For information, call (215) 625-9200 or (800) 555-5191.
 &HT;    It's not Wrigley Field, but Veterans Stadium does have real
baseball, and it's next to the First Union Center. No matter what
they say about Philadelphia fans, the Vet is a friendly place. The
Phillies are home July 25 to July 30 (Chicago and Los Angeles),
Aug. 7 to Aug. 16 (San Diego, Houston and Arizona) and Aug. 25 to
Aug. 30 (San Francisco and Colorado). Tickets, $7 to $22.50;
information, (215) 463-1000.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    In a city that never runs out of material, the Foundation for
Architecture leads walking tours of about two hours five days a
week _ Saturday and Sunday at 2 p.m., and Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday evenings at 6.
 &HT;    A dozen offerings during the convention include ``20th Century
Unlimited,'' around Center Square, and ``Littlest Streets,'' along
the old, once-bohemian residential alleys of Washington Square
West. Adults $7, students $6; (215) 569-3187.
 &HT;    A different thread of history is on view at the hulking Eastern
State Penitentiary, 22nd Street and Fairmount Avenue. Eastern
State, one of the nation's first penitentiaries, opened in 1829 and
was home to Al Capone and Willie Sutton. The gothic stone monster
was only recently rescued from decades of decay and opened for
tours of Capone's specially furnished cell and other exhibits on
Wednesdays through Sundays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. in summer. The
fee is $7, $5 for students and ages 55 and up, and $3 for under 17.
Information, (215) 236-3300.
 &HT;    Walkers naturally seek out Society Hill, the core of
Philadelphia's original civic life and of its downtown revival 30
years ago. It's a genteel quarter, red brick from the sidewalks up,
encompassing Independence National Historic Park and dotted with
courtyards and churchyards, with many Georgian and Federal
buildings. But at its southern edge, South Street booms at night
with bars and quirky shops.
 &HT;    Across Society Hill's northern boundary, Market Street, is Old
City, which 20 years ago was a disused quarter of small, abandoned
garment factories with a few luncheonettes and a string of
restaurant-supply stores. The area is now packed with galleries,
coffeehouses, restaurants and clubs.
 &HT;    Runners can always put on shorts and head up the Benjamin
Franklin Parkway from Center City to the Philadelphia Museum of
Art. A jogging and bike path continues another four miles along the
Schuylkill, where the sights _ bridges, scullers, masses of willows
_ are pretty much as Thomas Eakins painted them more than 100 years
ago.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Philadelphia is booked for convention week, but the building
binge has ensured a tourists' market for most other weeks of the
summer and fall. To find out about hotel packages, including
tickets to cultural events, call a visitors' information number:
(888) 467-4452.
 &HT;    The Sheraton Society Hill, Second and Walnut Streets, has a
quiet, established niche in the historic district. Like its
surroundings, the low-rise red-brick hotel is Colonial (except for
the swimming pool) and sedate. The 365 traditional rooms and suites
range from $155 to $270 for a double. Reservations, (215) 238-6000,
fax (215) 238-6652.
 &HT;    A block from the convention center, Loews, 1200 Market St.,
(215) 627-1200, fax (215) 231-7305, is an Art Deco creation in an
old bank building (check out the vault doors). The 583 rooms are
pure 1930s luxe. A standard double is $175 to $240.
 &HT;    Just off Rittenhouse Square, the Sofitel, a part of the French
hotel chain, recently opened at 120 South 17th St., on a pleasingly
unreconstructed block of tiny shops. The hotel, by contrast, is all
modern and smooth, its 306 rooms furnished in gleaming woods and
geometric prints. Doubles, $189; (215) 569-8300, fax (215)
569-1492.
 &HT;    Budget: The Hawthorn Suites, 1100 Vine St., (215) 829-8300, fax
(215) 829-8104, is crisp and new, if a bit spare. Each of the 294
suites, at $149 to $159 (sometimes less on weekends), has
refrigerator, microwave and wet bar, making life easier for
families. At the northern edge of Center City, the hotel towers
over the convention center and Chinatown.
 &HT;    Luxury: The Park Hyatt Philadelphia at the Bellevue, Broad and
Walnut Streets, is rich in detail and history, a match for the
Academy of Music on the next corner of the theater district. With
just 172 rooms, including suites, it has a ballroom, a
conservatory, a rooftop rose garden and such amenities as a day
spa. Doubles start at $275; (215) 893-1234, fax (215) 732-8518.
 &HT;    Rittenhouse Bed and Breakfast, 1715 Rittenhouse Square, (215)
545-1755, fax (215) 545-1750, is as elegant as the neighboring
square, formal from its facade to its nightly shoeshine service.
Some of the 10 individually decorated rooms, all with baths, have
fireplaces and whirlpools. Rates are $220 to $340 and include full
breakfast.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    An anchor of Center City's restaurant row, Susanna Foo, 1512
Walnut St., (215) 545-2666, has done Asian fusion elegantly for
years. Under silk lanterns, diners can make their way from Chinese
soups and delicate dumplings to emphatically French desserts
(apricot tart with almond ice cream, for one). Dinner for two
people with wine, about $125.
 &HT;    Fishmarket, 122 South 18th St., (215) 569-9080, offers seafood
in a town house with just enough painted wood to feel like a crab
house. In fact, for the summer, the Fishmarket is making a big
production of crabs. Take a stool at the glistening raw bar at
happy hour and enjoy oysters for $1 each. Dinner for two, with a
bottle of wine, about $120. Closed Sunday.
 &HT;    Le Bar Lyonnais, 1523 Walnut St., (215) 567-1000, is the
downstairs wing of Le Bec-Fin, the French restaurant that has been
on national best-of lists for years. The bar offers many lighter
Bec-Fin standards like the galette de crabe and vichyssoise au
caviar at considerably lower prices. The atmosphere is rich, dark
and close -- it seats about 30. No reservations. Dinner for two
with drinks, about $100. Closed Sunday.
 &HT;    On the other side of Rittenhouse Square, Audrey Claire, (215)
731-1222, opens its wide windows at the corner of 20th and Spruce
Streets to a neighborhood of brownstones and small shops. The fare
is Mediterranean _ Audrey Claire is known for its grilled
flatbreads _ and simple. Outdoor tables available. No reservations
on Friday and Saturday. Bring your own wine. Dinner for two, about
$60. Closed Monday.
 &HT;    Effie's, at 1127 Pine St. on Antique Row, (215) 592-8333, is a
tiny Greek restaurant in a row house with a tiny, inviting garden.
Effie's has fresh fish every day, usually served whole, brushed
with lemon and olive oil and grilled. Bring your own wine. Dinner
for two, under $40.
 &HT;    For those who cannot leave town without a cheesesteak, the pure
South Philadelphia version is available at Pat's King of Steaks,
(215) 468-1546, or Geno's, (215) 389-0659, competing cholesterol
palaces at the intersection of Passyunk, South Ninth and Wharton
Streets.
 &HT;    And for South Philly pizza, try Marra's, 1734 East Passyunk
Ave., (215) 463-9249, now in its third generation. Wear a tank top
and bring $5 to $10 a person (that includes the beer).
 &HT;    A note about Pennsylvania dining: Most restaurants have liquor
licenses, but if you must bring your own, plan. Wine and liquor are
sold only in state stores, which are sparse, poorly stocked and
expensive. They are also not open late or on Sunday.

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY MARY-LOU WEISMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    My husband, Larry, and I like to go house hunting on vacation.
One minute we are behaving like proper tourists in Provence, Sydney
or Prague, and the next we're making plans to live there. It's not
enough to be seeing the sites, enjoying the culture, eating the
food and drinking the wine; we have to own the place.
 &HT;    We travel the way Caesar's army conquered Gaul; we come, we see,
we acquire real estate _ at least in our dreams.
 &HT;    When in Rome, Larry imagines himself sitting all day outside his
apartment in the Piazza Navona. He is sipping cappuccino, reading a
book on architecture and smoking. (Larry resumes smoking on all of
his fantasy vacations.)
 &HT;    Larry does not have a job in Rome. I don't either, unless diving
for coins in the Trevi Fountain counts. In order to keep our
fantasy aloft, we have learned to avoid the little pinpricks of
reality such as how we're going to make a living, what we'll do for
friends, where to redeem our empty soda cans or what to do with our
children.
 &HT;    Not every vacation destination is good fantasy material. It may
be a nice place to visit, but even inveterate dreamers wouldn't
want to live there. Some places are too hot; some too cold. I'd be
cutting sod in Ireland right now if it weren't for the bloody rain.
 &HT;    We don't have many third-world real-estate fantasies. I hate to
think we could be so shallow, but it may be that our ability to
have a good fantasy is linked to the life expectancy and gross
national product of the country involved.
 &HT;    We once went on a ``trek'' in the Himalayas. I passed scores of
women who were also trekking, but they were doing it all day every
day, up and down the mountain carrying plastic buckets of water on
their heads.
 &HT;    The Nepalese fantasy outlook was a little more promising for
Larry. The men spent their days sitting cross-legged, playing
cards, smoking and growing stubble. Sure, I yearned to breathe that
pure mountain air on a permanent basis, and to see day break
gloriously each morning over Mount Everest _ but not with a bucket
on my head.
 &HT;    Paris is our favorite place in which to pretend to live. We've
almost bought real estate there several times. We don't care if the
French aren't friendly. When we are French, we won't be friendly
either.
 &HT;    I love to imagine who I'd be if I were French. I walk the
streets, giving the women the once-over, especially the femmes d'un
certain age, my age, middle age, to be precise.
 &HT;    Would I dare to slip into the skin of that flamboyantly hennaed
woman carrying the baguette, the one with the cheekbones, the
purple frock and the green kid heels that do not hurt her feet?
 &HT;    I imagine her on her way to the open-air market where she will
buy an armload of flowers and, on a whim, a canary in a cage. (I
don't like birds and have never wished to own one, but in Paris I
will.)
 &HT;    Larry the lawyer thinks he's that insouciant guy over there,
leaning against the archway rolling a Gauloise around between his
lips, letting the ash fall. Larry's fantasy involves frequent
visits to the Louvre, reading in the Tuileries, eating sweetbreads
and, in the summers, sailing off the coast of Normandy. (Larry
doesn't sail and we have lived for 30 years on Long Island Sound.)
 &HT;    After a few days of imagining ourselves French, we find we are
speaking French. That is to say, we are speaking our very own
spontaneous patois _ using French words when we can remember them,
and when we can't, speaking English with a French accent, like
Charles Boyer. But of course.
 &HT;    We eat a lot of sandwichs jambon. We return to the same cafe at
dusk. We discuss which of our favorite reds should be our house
wine. Thus Frenchified, we feel that the time is right to find our
fantasy home.
 &HT;    Invariably, on one of our many delightfully aimless walks, we
find ourselves in front of a real-estate office. We examine the
photographs on display in the window. Do we want a house or an
apartment? Should we louer or acheter? The Left Bank, of course,
but quelle arrondissement?
 &HT;    Larry, whose favorite opera is ``La Boheme,'' would like
something in the way of a garret, with a dormer window and chimney
pots. And a sink in the corner. I'm not fussy, as long as there's a
place for my canary.
 &HT;    But can we afford it? Larry converts the various asking prices
from francs into dollars. These conversions are followed by a
pause, which is long and weighty enough to indicate that we are
giving sober consideration to the matter.
 &HT;    Then he speaks the words that let me know we've got a
full-fledged fantasy on our hands: ``I wonder how much we could get
for our house?'' We've got lift-off.
 &HT;    It is embarrassing to think about the trail of aborted rental
and purchase agreements we have left in our wake. In St.-Remy it
was ``Small house in town with irises and cyprus trees''; in
Katmandu ``Renovated monastery cell''; in Jackson Hole ``Log cabin,
Teton backdrop''; in the Cotswolds ``One-bedroom cottage,
thatched.''
 &HT;    How easily we betray our real lives in our dreams! How heedless
of the time and energy we put into home, community and friends,
never mind love of country. Vacation fantasizing is a lot like a
midlife crisis. You want to dump your old life and marry some place
new.
 &HT;    We are not the innocent, faithful children we once were. We
don't call out a fond, ``Goodbye house, goodbye door, goodbye
steps, goodbye lawn'' as we back down the driveway. Instead, it's
``Lemme outa here'' as we make our escape, pursued by a swarm of
stress: Did I change the message on the answering machine? Do I
have my passport? Did I hold the mail, pay the bills, call off the
newspaper, program the VCR, turn down the thermostat, straighten my
sock drawer, review my will, forget the tickets, remember the
Xanax? Who wouldn't want to live somewhere else?
 &HT;    Most of the time we're pretty good at keeping fantasy in its
place. Of course we're not going to live in a garret in Paris.
We're just playing house. We've learned our lesson the hard way.
Whenever we have tried to mix fantasy with reality, the gods have
exacted their price. It can be paid in either cash or humiliation.
 &HT;    After a particularly pleasant vacation in London a few years
ago, we resisted the temptation to buy a flat and settled for
buying a London cab. At the time, cabs that had been retired from
service were sold at a garage near Elephant and Castle. Ours had
over 300,000 miles on it. It had a running board. It was full of
quaint advertisements. The seat flipped down. The meter worked. We
 &HT;    imagined what fun we'd have picking up our friends for dinner
and the movies.
 &HT;    Once home, we waited eagerly for the word from Hoboken that our
taxi had arrived. When Larry claimed it at the dock, he and three
guys with tattoos had to push it to get it started. Then the wheels
fell off. The customs inspector felt so sorry for Larry he refused
to charge him any duty.
 &HT;    On yet another occasion we trespassed the threshold between
fantasy and reality big time. It was the '70s, and we were young
and idealistic. We moved from Connecticut to Big Sur, Calif., on
the strength of a two-week stay at the Esalen Institute, where I
was convinced that I could actualize my human potential by pounding
on a pillow and hugging strangers.
 &HT;    It's not as if our friends didn't try to warn us. One of them
did his best to stop us, but we stubbornly refused to get the
point.
 &HT;    ``Haven't you ever had a fantasy about living a better life in
another place?'' I challenged him.
 &HT;    ``Of course I have. I even have a favorite fantasy. I want to
move to London and hire out as a butler in a well-appointed home.''
 &HT;    ``Well then why don't you do it?'' I said.
 &HT;    ``Because then I wouldn't have it as a fantasy any more.''
 &HT;    For an entire year I was a California mountain woman. I
earnestly eschewed brassieres in favor of black leotards. I wore
long paisley skirts that could double as tablecloths, tied at the
waist. I grew all my hair. I made my own granola. I said ``far
out.'' But no matter what I did or how hard I pounded, I was still
from the Northeast.
 &HT;    Larry, who is better than I am at making the best of a bad deal,
smoked a lot and volunteered as a model for the massage class. When
we finally got home and slipped back into reality we vowed we'd
never, ever again lose our grip on fantasy.

 (Color slide included.) 
 By ADELE MALOTT 
 Condensed from The Mature Traveler Newsletter 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Many travel companies now offer their budget-conscious and
entrepreneurial customers a way to save money on their trips _
sometimes as much as the full price of an airline ticket or the
entire cost of a tour.
 &HT;    The secret? Become a group travel leader. As the name implies,
group travel leaders earn their savings by recruiting friends,
neighbors or people they know from church groups or service clubs
to travel together.
 &HT;    Some mature travelers are so adept at organizing groups that it
becomes something of a part-time business in which they develop
various travel clubs and produce newsletters.
 &HT;    Robert Rogers of Eureka Springs, Ark., started out hoping to
earn travel credits as a ``vacation ambassador'' for Grand Circle
Travel, (800) 597-2452. GCT ambassadors earn a $100 credit for each
of the first four travelers he or she recruits in a calendar year.
Starting with the fifth traveler, credits accumulate at a rate of
$150 per person. The credits can be cashed in for any future trip
offered by GCT.
 &HT;    Rogers' first encounter with Grand Circle occurred two years ago
when he took an all-inclusive trip to the Costa Del Sol. Rogers was
so impressed with the itinerary on that particular tour that he
recommended it to some of his friends, describing it as a ``totally
relaxing'' experience. His anecdotes about the days he spent on the
Mediterranean coast were enough to convince his friends to sign up.
He then made bookings for them.
 &HT;    Rogers was so successful with his inaugural referrals that when
the list grew to 12 friends, GCT designated him a group leader _ a
notch up from vacation ambassador _ earning him a complimentary
trip.
 &HT;    Like Rogers, Bob Jones of Coldchester, Conn., was able to
stretch his travel dollar by also becoming a group leader. After
retiring in 1994 from his job as branch manager of the American
Automobile Association, Jones refused to slow down. ``I am just too
active to do nothing,'' he said. That's when he began asking
friends if they wanted to start a travel club.
 &HT;    After about 75 percent of those he asked said, ``Yes,'' Jones
started organizing cruises for a local travel agency. It wasn't
long before he branched out, coordinating groups for GCT. His first
trip for GCT was to Mexico's Copper Canyon.
 &HT;    
 THE MORE, THE MERRIER  
 &HT;    The larger groups help pay Jones' travel expenses and provide a
way for him to include extras, such as renting a motor coach for
the group to ride together to the New York airport.
 &HT;    ``But once we were in New York, I didn't have to do a thing,''
he says. ``We had our own coach and guide. He handled every
detail.''
 &HT;    Jones says that organizing a travel group can incur some costs,
depending on the amount of energy one wishes to invest in
recruiting participants. For example, Jones opted to personally
mail out brochures. He also took care of receiving each traveler's
deposit and forwarding it to GCT. But, he says, ``After that, Grand
Circle took over ... I didn't even have to count the luggage or the
people _ not once.''
 &HT;    As Jones points out, ``Anyone who is outgoing should be able to
do this.'' He has even gone so far as to hold social gatherings at
his home, where he shows a travel film describing an upcoming
destination and serves coffee and snacks. ``Then it all seems to
happen by itself,'' he says.
 &HT;    Jones has also been a group leader with other travel companies,
including Brendan Tours, Holland America and TWA.
 &HT;    Marion Lothian of Lakehurst, N.J., thinks it's her attention to
detail that makes her trips extra special. In fact, she admits that
her desire for everything to ``be just right'' is the main reason
why she chooses to serve as the intermediary for each participant.
That means getting each deposit, collecting the rest of the
payment, organizing a bus to the airport and allocating tips for
baggage handlers and guides.
 &HT;    ``I want to take care of everything so they don't have to stick
their hands in their pockets for anything,'' she says.
 &HT;    Just before each trip, Lothian briefs her travelers so they know
what to wear, how to handle the money in the country they will
visit and what to do with their passports and visas. When the trip
is concluded, Lothian does her book work and IRS paperwork.
 &HT;    Lothian has worked with Vantage Deluxe World Travel, (800)
634-2180; Collette, (888) 344-5578; and GCT. She even developed her
own travel club in her community of 3,500 and serves as club
president. This past spring she organized tours to Scandinavia and
Spain.
 &HT;    
 WITH THE PERKS COMES WORK  
 &HT;    Lothian suggests that anyone who is thinking about becoming a
group travel leader should have a nice personality as well as ``a
strong sense of right and wrong and how to handle situations while
keeping their cool.
 &HT;    ``If they don't want to do the preparation or book work, they
shouldn't get involved because it is work and responsibility,'' she
adds.
 &HT;    Many travel brochures now spell out the details of group-travel
credits or comps. For example, Vantage Deluxe World Travel provides
a free trip, double occupancy, to group leaders for each group of
10 they recruit _ even if the leader doesn't travel with the group.
 &HT;    Immersia Travel, (800) 207-5454, offers a $1,000 savings for a
``group travel planner'' who gathers five travelers for a trip. A
complimentary trip is earned when the planner gathers 10 people.
For groups of 14 or more, the planner gets both a complimentary
trip and a $100-per-person rebate.
 &HT;

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By LISA FUGARD  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    If birders go birding then those who seek out wildflowers surely
go flowering; the term botanizing doesn't begin to capture the
sweet delight I experienced on discovering the profusion of
wildflowers growing in the Burren in County Clare on Ireland's west
coast.
 &HT;    My romance with bird's-foot trefoil, mountain avens and herb
Robert came about by accident. When I flew into Shannon last July
and met my mother, Sheila, for a 10-day holiday, it was with the
intention of viewing shore birds and, with luck, a few seals.
 &HT;    Bleak and harsh are the adjectives often used to describe the
Burren, a roughly 100-square-mile limestone landscape of cliffs,
stony hills and broad stretches of rock resembling pavement. I have
an affinity for such landscapes, as does my mother, and the
boireann, the Irish word for rocky place, did not disappoint us.
 &HT;    Two and a half hours after leaving the airport in a
sardine-can-sized rental car, well suited to skinny country roads,
we crested a hill just above a stretch of coastline called Pol
Salach and saw a stunning panorama of fierce Ireland _ shattered
terraces of stark limestone spilling into a sea that was gray as
elephant skin.
 &HT;    We followed the coast road through the lonely village of Fanore
where horses grazed in rock-strewn pastures next to the beach, past
Black Head where the limestone cliffs plunged into the sea. Masses
of oxeye daisies and fuchsias blooming on the side of the road
softened the austere beauty of the rock.
 &HT;    By the time we reached Ballyvaughan, a tiny village sitting on a
tranquil corner of Galway Bay, we were enamored of the Burren.
Smoked salmon and mussels at Monk's Bar on the quay and two elegant
bedrooms in Rusheen Lodge, a four-star guest house, only added to
our satisfaction.
 &HT;    The next morning we drove into the hills behind Ballyvaughan
where flinty stone walls divided the land into pastures. I was
itching to walk among the rocks, but in planning the trip I had
promised my mother a ruin a day. My passion for the natural world
is matched by her passion for mosques, temples, tombs and ruined
churches. Such churches abound in the Burren, as do ring forts and
Neolithic tombs.
 &HT;    Our first visit was to the village of Kilfenora where the
tiniest medieval cathedral awaited us. The nave or front section is
still used for church services while the roofless chancel radiates
stillness and mystery. Two identical stone carvings _ apparently
the head of a bishop _ have a vaguely Egyptian air about them.
 &HT;    A delicate trefoil sedilia _ three seats crowned with a
beautifully carved pinnacle _ is recessed into one wall, while on
the adjacent wall are two naively incised 13th- and 14th-century
stone carvings.
 &HT;    One of them, supposedly of a cleric, had us perplexed. What did
the oval head and elongated neck remind us of? Where had we seen
that serene, otherworldly demeanor?
 &HT;    My mother, who is half Irish and has a streak of sly Irish wit
about her, solved that mystery when she exclaimed ``The Holy
Alien!''
 &HT;    Pelting rain and sudden squalls, rain that drizzles and mizzles
_ Ireland is one of the few countries where such weather is
shrugged off, hardly a deterrent to wildflower adventures.
 &HT;    After lunch I dropped my mother back at the B&AMP;B and, armed with
``Wild Plants of the Burren and the Aran Islands,'' bought at the
Burren Interpretive Center at Kilfenora, and a large umbrella
(which immediately marked me as a foreigner and a sissy), I drove
40 minutes along the coast road to rocky Pol Salach for my first
afternoon of flowering.
 &HT;    The great mystique of the flora of the Burren lies in its
diversity and its growing habits _ Mediterranean and arctic-alpine
plants thrive side by side. None of the species are unique to the
Burren, but many grow in the limestone landscape in greater
abundance than anywhere else in Ireland or Britain.
 &HT;    I parked the car, climbed over a low stone wall and crouched on
the ground. Crushing wild thyme between my fingers, I breathed
deep. I'd identified my first wildflower. And what were the tiny
white flowers intertwined with the thyme? I thumbed through my
flower book.
 &HT;    Yes! It was squinancy wort. After half an hour of literally
crawling through a cow pasture so ablaze with flowers it seemed as
though a beneficent fairy artist had dipped her paintbrush in
magenta, blue, yellow, cream and periwinkle blue and flicked it
over the ground, I reached the limestone pavement.
 &HT;    Smooth, relatively flat, rectangular chunks of limestone called
clints are separated from one another by fissures that range in
depth from one foot to 20. It's in these fissures, or grikes, that
the pluckiest of plants flourish. The magenta flowers of bloody
cranesbill swayed brightly against the bone-colored rock, and I saw
honeysuck le plants twisted into bonsais by the strong winds.
 &HT;    Closer to the sea cliffs I found those plants that thrive in the
salty spray gusting off Galway Bay _ bobbing heads of pink thrift
and sea campion and thick seaweedy-looking ferns that glistened in
the grikes. Of course, there were plants that I couldn't identify.
 &HT;    There are over 600 species recorded in the Burren. The book I
carried listed 120. I was momentarily frustrated. Then smiled. My
naming them didn't bring the flowers into being. Why not simply
enjoy them?
 &HT;    Our love affair with the Burren was now well under way, and the
following day while driving to Corcomroe, a Cistercian abbey that
lies five miles east of Ballyvaughan, my mother fantasized about
buying property. We parked at the end of a country lane and
immediately registered an eerie sound that seemed to be rising from
the ruined abbey. A ham-fisted ghost stumbling over the bass keys
of an organ?
 &HT;    After some investigation the Organist of Corcomroe, as he is now
affectionately remembered by my mother and me, turned out to be a
most handsome blond bull lowing to several docile black-and-white
cows cloistered in a field on the opposite side of the road.
 &HT;    While Kilfenora's chancel is exquisitely intimate, Corcomroe,
with the wind gusting through it, feels lonely and desolate. It
also has a stunning roof, as do most of the churches we visited,
with a wide swath of changeable Irish sky through which the rooks
wheeled and cawed. On some of the pillars the traces of carvings of
flowers can be found, a stony reminder of the abbey's other name,
Our Lady of the Fertile Rocks.
 &HT;    In one corner there is a recumbent effigy said to be that of an
O'Brien king killed nearby in 1267. Above it is an unfinished
14th-century carving, presumably of the abbot of Corcomroe. With a
hint of a smile on his face and rather puffy attire, he looks as
though he's levitating up the ruined chancel.
 &HT;    ``Three days is not enough time to explore the Burren,'' I
lamented over dinner that night in the superb Whitethorn
restaurant.
 &HT;    Reservations in Connemara awaited us, so the following day we
left for County Galway. On our way we stopped at Thoor Ballylee
near the town of Gort _ less than an hour's drive from Ballyvaughan
_ where Yeats summered from 1917 to 1929. The recorded commentary
issuing from speakers in his dining room, study and bedroom didn't
interest me so I climbed higher.
 &HT;    Close to the top of the stone tower I found what was surely the
true spirit of Yeats _ a soft-feathered, fierce-eyed kestrel
guarding her chick on a nest of sticks.
 &HT;    After two days in Connemara, during which time the sun blazed 16
hours a day and I swam in the stillest, bluest bay I'd ever seen,
gray clouds rolled in from the ocean. Rain spattered on the window
of our hotel. ``Only one place to be in such moody weather,'' I
said to my mother. Back to the Burren we raced.
 &HT;    Rusheen Lodge had been lovely, but I always feel as though I'm
staying in my grandparents' house when I visit a B &AMP; B. That
evening we checked into the Ballinalacken Castle Hotel, a sprawling
country house sitting on a hill just below a 15th-century O'Brien
tower house. The ruin is now roped off because too many visitors
were leaving with chunks of genuine Irish castle in their pockets.
 &HT;    We felt like Burren old-timers, and our remaining days took on
an easy routine. In the mornings we visited churches, castles and
towers. There was Dysert O'Dea, where a bizarre array of
Romanesque-style animal and human heads arches over the south
doorway of the church.
 &HT;    Lemaneagh Castle, worthy of at least a few ghosts, stands proud
in a stretch of windswept farmland (equally creepy was the electric
fence surrounding the field and the old Irish codger who scowled at
the few cars parked just beyond his land).
 &HT;    In Killinaboy we came across a humble ruined church with a
simple carving of the Crucifixion and the weathered Sheila na gig,
an ancient fertility symbol, above the entrance.
 &HT;    Each afternoon I went flowering. A walk up the Kyber Pass, a
road in Fanore that follows the Caher River _ the only surface
river in the Burren, as most of the rainwater seeps into the
underground waterways _ will be remembered as the afternoon I
discovered orchids.
 &HT;    Except for the exquisite bee orchid, the terrestrial species of
the Burren are not as showy as tropical orchids that cling to
trees. Still, I was captivated by their demure beauty.
 &HT;    On another day I went mad for ferns. I kept meaning to hike one
of the ancient green roads that lace the Burren; they're noted for
the wildflowers but I was smitten with rock, with the way a
saucer-sized depression on a boulder could hold an array of small
flowers brilliant as jewels, the way the wind gusting off Galway
Bay tossed the tousled pink flowers of hemp agrimony, a species
that grew en masse in the limestone fissures.
 &HT;    And then there was the food _ lobsters, crabs, black sole,
salmon, mussels. We feasted every evening at local restaurants and
returned to our hotel _ my mother had renamed it Fawlty Castle in
honor of the quirky yet utterly charming staff _ in time for sunset
tea, which, in early July, was at about 9 p.m.
 &HT;    On our last morning in the Burren I wandered the pavement at Pol
Salach, saying goodbye to yet another part of the world I'd fallen
in love with. My evening reading had been from a chapter in ``The
Burren: A Companion to the Wildflowers of an Irish Limestone
Wilderness'' that touched on the historical use of many of the
plants Id been rhapsodizing over, and as I whispered the names of
the flowers surrounding me, I felt as though I were floating back
in time.
 &HT;    Lady's bedstraw _ makes good bedding and can be used as a rennet
plant for curdling milk; squinancy wort _ useful if I ever get an
attack of quinsy; carline thistle _ preserve the buds with honey
and sugar for a tasty sweetmeat; Burnet rose _ I'll drink a syrup
made from the rosehips if I'm coughing, spitting blood or stricken
with scurvy.
 &HT;    The monks of Corcomroe must have put many of these plants to
medicinal use. Perhaps the levitating abbot secretly snacked on
carline thistles.
 &HT;    As for the Holy Alien? That otherworldly, rather blissful
demeanor might have come about from one too many afternoons spent
flowering.
 &HT;    -----
 SIDEBAR: REVELING IN BIRD'S-FOOT TREFOIL, SQUINANCY WORT AND
THRIFT  
 LODGING  
 &HT;    Rusheen Lodge. Just outside the village of Ballyvaughan, this
four-star guest house has six lovely, spacious rooms with private
bathrooms, and two suites. Doubles are $72; the suites $108, full
breakfast included, calculated at $1.21 to the Irish pound.
Telephone (353-65) 70 77092, fax (353-65) 70 77152.
 &HT;    Ballinalacken Castle Hotel. We loved this creaky yet elegant
hotel on the outskirts of Lisdoonvarna. Drinking tea in the sitting
room and sprawling about our spacious, rather oddly but grandly
decorated room made us feel like fading aristocrats. Some rooms
have splendid views of the Aran Islands, while others (nos. 5, 6,
10 and 11) do not. Doubles are $48 to $54, with full Irish
breakfast. For reservations, telephone or fax (353-65) 70 74025.
 DINING  
 &HT;    Sheedy's Hotel and Restaurant. What this restaurant in
Lisdoonvarna lacks in decor it makes up for with superb food. I had
an entree of black sole so exquisite I wonder if I'll ever eat fish
that fresh again. A three-course dinner for two, excluding drinks,
averages $60. Sheedy's bar has a seafood menu. Telephone (353-65)
70 74026.
 &HT;    The Whitethorn. Situated a half mile east of Ballyvaughan on the
coast road to Galway, this elegant restaurant has a stunning view
of Galway Bay. Dinner for two averages $70 and is served Friday and
Saturday nights only in July and August. Weekends and weekdays the
lunch service is buffet style and the food is just as delicious.
 &HT;    Attached is a shop crammed with good clothing, Irish crafts and
all the guidebooks needed to explore the Burren. Telephone (353-5)
70 77044.
 INFORMATION  
 &HT;    The Burren Interpretive Center at Kilfe nora, the first such
center in Ireland, has models and exhibits explaining the geology,
flora and fauna of the Burren, as well as an audiovisual lecture of
the area. Open daily 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. through September (to 5
p.m. October to May). Telephone (353-65) 70 88030. Admission $3.
 &HT;    Recommended reading: ``The Burren: a Companion to the
Wildflowers of an Irish Limestone Wilderness'' (Collins Press), by
E. Charles Nelson, who is utterly bewitched by the Burren. For help
in identifying flowers, pick up a copy of ``Wild Plants of the
Burren and the Aran Islands,'' also by E. Charles Nelson. Both
books are available at the Whitethorn and the Burren Interpretive
Center at Kilfenora.

SHOPPING AROUND: APRIL IN PARIS? WHY NOT?

 (Color slide included.) 
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Autumn may be the most delightful time to visit Paris, Rome and
many other European destinations. After all, most of the tourists
have gone home, museums have shorter lines and the weather can be
the best of the year.
 &HT;    Hotel prices, however, may not be that much lower than they are
in July and August because September and October are becoming
increasingly popular months to travel. But come late October,
prices do indeed fall.
 &HT;    For those considering a European getaway this autumn, here are
some planning tools.
 AIRFARES &AMP; PACKAGES  
 &HT;    Those who simply want a good, cheap airfare should look to
Expedia.com (www.expedia.com), Travelocity.com
(www.travelocity.com) and LowestFare.com (www.lowestfare.com),
which offer fare finders for thrifty travelers.
 &HT;    Another way to save money is with package deals that include
round-trip airfare, accommodations and transfers _ all for a single
price. Major American and European air carriers offer various
packages to Europe, but two carriers with extensive offerings are
British Airways (Holiday Desk, 75-20 Astoria Blvd., Jackson
Heights, NY 11370; 877-428-2228; www.britishairways.com) and
American Airlines (P.O. Box 619688, DFW Airport, Texas 75261;
800-882-8880; www.aa.com).
 &HT;    Package prices are fixed, and they're frequently available with
as little as seven days' advance notice. The best ones offer a
range of hotel choices, satisfying both budget-minded travelers and
those who want to splash out a little.
 ESCORTED TOURS  
 &HT;    For a single price, escorted tours provide airfare, hotel
accommodations, transfers, transportation as well as most meals,
sightseeing, baggage handling and taxes.
 &HT;    Fortunately, most tour companies no longer try to cram seven
countries into seven days. The smarter ones are tailoring their
trips to people who were brought up traveling independently.
 &HT;    The price can be right, because an escorted tour almost always
costs less than pricing components separately and it comes with the
added benefit of service.
 &HT;    Dozens of companies offer such tours to France, Spain and
virtually every country in Western and Eastern Europe. Travelers
can narrow their search by contacting the United States Tour
Operator Association (342 Madison Ave., Suite 1522, New York, NY
10173; 212-599-6599; www.ustoa.com).
 TRAINS  
 &HT;    Getting around Europe by train is easy. And the easiest way to
research European rail schedules and prices is to contact Rail
Europe (44 South Broadway, White Plains, NY 10601; 800-4-EURAIL;
www.raileurope.com), which also includes Brit Rail.
 &HT;    With a little work, smart travelers can determine whether it's
cheaper to buy point-to-point tickets or to go for a railpass _ or
perhaps decide that a rental car might be even cheaper if there are
enough people traveling together.
 &HT;    A basic Eurailpass costs $554 and provides 15 consecutive days
of unlimited first-class travel in the 17 member countries:
Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,
Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal,
Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.
 &HT;    But Rail Europe offers an array of regional and national passes,
in both first- and second-class versions. Many passes also come in
flexi-pass versions, since many travelers won't travel on every day
of their vacation.
 &HT;    A German Flexipass, for example, permits four days of travel in
a one-month period, for $252 in first class and $174 in second.
 &HT;    There are also passes that save two travelers money, like the
Swiss Saver Flexipass. It's $198 in first class and $132 in second
class, per person, for two travelers. They get three days of travel
within one month. Single travelers pay $234 and $156, respectively,
for these same passes.
 &HT;    Regional passes, such as the Europass, link France, Germany,
Italy, Spain and Switzerland. Rail Europe also offers a variety of
Eurostar tickets, for travel on the high-speed train between
Brussels, London and Paris.
 RENTALS  
 &HT;    Renting a European house or apartment for a week or more is
often an affordable way to go. That's true for a London apartment,
a Swiss chalet or a French villa.
 &HT;    Most renters will find that they get more space for their money,
even in a studio apartment, than at a comparable hotel.
 &HT;    Small homes and larger villas are suitable for families or
couples traveling together. In fact, when families or couples pool
their finances, renting can be a true cost-saver.
 &HT;    When looking for a rental, choose a property by location as well
as size and amenities. These companies offer a wide range of
European rentals:
 &HT;     The French Experience  (370 Lexington Ave., Suite 812, New
York, NY 10017; 212-986-3800; www.frenchexperience.com) has long
specialized in ``gites,'' rural vacation homes throughout the
French countryside.
 &HT;     Homes Away  (34 Park Road, Toronto M4W 2N4, Ontario, Canada;
800-374-6637; www.homesaway.com) has a handful of upscale rentals
in the most desirable areas of France and Italy.
 &HT;     The Landmark Trust  (707 Kipling Road, Dummerston, VT 05301;
802-254-6868; www.landmarktrust.co.uk) has a selection of unusual
rentals in period buildings throughout the British Isles.
 &HT;     Paris Sejours Reservations  (875 N. Michigan Ave., Suite 3214,
Chicago, IL 60611; 312-587-7707; www.PSRyourhomeinParis.com)
focuses on Paris apartments, from studios on up.
 &HT;     The Parker Company  (Seaport Landing, 152 Lynnway, Lynn, MA
01902; 800-280-2811; www.parkercompany.com) specializes in Italy.
 &HT;     WIMCO  (P.O. Box 1461, Newport, RI 02840; 800-932-3222;
www.wimcovillas.com) offers rentals in England, France, Ireland,
Italy and Scotland.

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY MARY-LOU WEISMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    My husband, Larry, and I like to go house hunting on vacation.
One minute we are behaving like proper tourists in Provence, Sydney
or Prague, and the next we're making plans to live there. It's not
enough to be seeing the sites, enjoying the culture, eating the
food and drinking the wine; we have to own the place.
 &HT;    We travel the way Caesar's army conquered Gaul; we come, we see,
we acquire real estate _ at least in our dreams.
 &HT;    When in Rome, Larry imagines himself sitting all day outside his
apartment in the Piazza Navona. He is sipping cappuccino, reading a
book on architecture and smoking. (Larry resumes smoking on all of
his fantasy vacations.)
 &HT;    Larry does not have a job in Rome. I don't either, unless diving
for coins in the Trevi Fountain counts. In order to keep our
fantasy aloft, we have learned to avoid the little pinpricks of
reality such as how we're going to make a living, what we'll do for
friends, where to redeem our empty soda cans or what to do with our
children.
 &HT;    Not every vacation destination is good fantasy material. It may
be a nice place to visit, but even inveterate dreamers wouldn't
want to live there. Some places are too hot; some too cold. I'd be
cutting sod in Ireland right now if it weren't for the bloody rain.
 &HT;    We don't have many third-world real-estate fantasies. I hate to
think we could be so shallow, but it may be that our ability to
have a good fantasy is linked to the life expectancy and gross
national product of the country involved.
 &HT;    We once went on a ``trek'' in the Himalayas. I passed scores of
women who were also trekking, but they were doing it all day every
day, up and down the mountain carrying plastic buckets of water on
their heads.
 &HT;    The Nepalese fantasy outlook was a little more promising for
Larry. The men spent their days sitting cross-legged, playing
cards, smoking and growing stubble. Sure, I yearned to breathe that
pure mountain air on a permanent basis, and to see day break
gloriously each morning over Mount Everest _ but not with a bucket
on my head.
 &HT;    Paris is our favorite place in which to pretend to live. We've
almost bought real estate there several times. We don't care if the
French aren't friendly. When we are French, we won't be friendly
either.
 &HT;    I love to imagine who I'd be if I were French. I walk the
streets, giving the women the once-over, especially the femmes d'un
certain age, my age, middle age, to be precise.
 &HT;    Would I dare to slip into the skin of that flamboyantly hennaed
woman carrying the baguette, the one with the cheekbones, the
purple frock and the green kid heels that do not hurt her feet?
 &HT;    I imagine her on her way to the open-air market where she will
buy an armload of flowers and, on a whim, a canary in a cage. (I
don't like birds and have never wished to own one, but in Paris I
will.)
 &HT;    Larry the lawyer thinks he's that insouciant guy over there,
leaning against the archway rolling a Gauloise around between his
lips, letting the ash fall. Larry's fantasy involves frequent
visits to the Louvre, reading in the Tuileries, eating sweetbreads
and, in the summers, sailing off the coast of Normandy. (Larry
doesn't sail and we have lived for 30 years on Long Island Sound.)
 &HT;    After a few days of imagining ourselves French, we find we are
speaking French. That is to say, we are speaking our very own
spontaneous patois _ using French words when we can remember them,
and when we can't, speaking English with a French accent, like
Charles Boyer. But of course.
 &HT;    We eat a lot of sandwichs jambon. We return to the same cafe at
dusk. We discuss which of our favorite reds should be our house
wine. Thus Frenchified, we feel that the time is right to find our
fantasy home.
 &HT;    Invariably, on one of our many delightfully aimless walks, we
find ourselves in front of a real-estate office. We examine the
photographs on display in the window. Do we want a house or an
apartment? Should we louer or acheter? The Left Bank, of course,
but quelle arrondissement?
 &HT;    Larry, whose favorite opera is ``La Boheme,'' would like
something in the way of a garret, with a dormer window and chimney
pots. And a sink in the corner. I'm not fussy, as long as there's a
place for my canary.
 &HT;    But can we afford it? Larry converts the various asking prices
from francs into dollars. These conversions are followed by a
pause, which is long and weighty enough to indicate that we are
giving sober consideration to the matter.
 &HT;    Then he speaks the words that let me know we've got a
full-fledged fantasy on our hands: ``I wonder how much we could get
for our house?'' We've got lift-off.
 &HT;    It is embarrassing to think about the trail of aborted rental
and purchase agreements we have left in our wake. In St.-Remy it
was ``Small house in town with irises and cyprus trees''; in
Katmandu ``Renovated monastery cell''; in Jackson Hole ``Log cabin,
Teton backdrop''; in the Cotswolds ``One-bedroom cottage,
thatched.''
 &HT;    How easily we betray our real lives in our dreams! How heedless
of the time and energy we put into home, community and friends,
never mind love of country. Vacation fantasizing is a lot like a
midlife crisis. You want to dump your old life and marry some place
new.
 &HT;    We are not the innocent, faithful children we once were. We
don't call out a fond, ``Goodbye house, goodbye door, goodbye
steps, goodbye lawn'' as we back down the driveway. Instead, it's
``Lemme outa here'' as we make our escape, pursued by a swarm of
stress: Did I change the message on the answering machine? Do I
have my passport? Did I hold the mail, pay the bills, call off the
newspaper, program the VCR, turn down the thermostat, straighten my
sock drawer, review my will, forget the tickets, remember the
Xanax? Who wouldn't want to live somewhere else?
 &HT;    Most of the time we're pretty good at keeping fantasy in its
place. Of course we're not going to live in a garret in Paris.
We're just playing house. We've learned our lesson the hard way.
Whenever we have tried to mix fantasy with reality, the gods have
exacted their price. It can be paid in either cash or humiliation.
 &HT;    After a particularly pleasant vacation in London a few years
ago, we resisted the temptation to buy a flat and settled for
buying a London cab. At the time, cabs that had been retired from
service were sold at a garage near Elephant and Castle. Ours had
over 300,000 miles on it. It had a running board. It was full of
quaint advertisements. The seat flipped down. The meter worked. We
 &HT;    imagined what fun we'd have picking up our friends for dinner
and the movies.
 &HT;    Once home, we waited eagerly for the word from Hoboken that our
taxi had arrived. When Larry claimed it at the dock, he and three
guys with tattoos had to push it to get it started. Then the wheels
fell off. The customs inspector felt so sorry for Larry he refused
to charge him any duty.
 &HT;    On yet another occasion we trespassed the threshold between
fantasy and reality big time. It was the '70s, and we were young
and idealistic. We moved from Connecticut to Big Sur, Calif., on
the strength of a two-week stay at the Esalen Institute, where I
was convinced that I could actualize my human potential by pounding
on a pillow and hugging strangers.
 &HT;    It's not as if our friends didn't try to warn us. One of them
did his best to stop us, but we stubbornly refused to get the
point.
 &HT;    ``Haven't you ever had a fantasy about living a better life in
another place?'' I challenged him.
 &HT;    ``Of course I have. I even have a favorite fantasy. I want to
move to London and hire out as a butler in a well-appointed home.''
 &HT;    ``Well then why don't you do it?'' I said.
 &HT;    ``Because then I wouldn't have it as a fantasy any more.''
 &HT;    For an entire year I was a California mountain woman. I
earnestly eschewed brassieres in favor of black leotards. I wore
long paisley skirts that could double as tablecloths, tied at the
waist. I grew all my hair. I made my own granola. I said ``far
out.'' But no matter what I did or how hard I pounded, I was still
from the Northeast.
 &HT;    Larry, who is better than I am at making the best of a bad deal,
smoked a lot and volunteered as a model for the massage class. When
we finally got home and slipped back into reality we vowed we'd
never, ever again lose our grip on fantasy.

 (Color slide included.) 
 By ADELE MALOTT 
 Condensed from The Mature Traveler Newsletter 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Many travel companies now offer their budget-conscious and
entrepreneurial customers a way to save money on their trips _
sometimes as much as the full price of an airline ticket or the
entire cost of a tour.
 &HT;    The secret? Become a group travel leader. As the name implies,
group travel leaders earn their savings by recruiting friends,
neighbors or people they know from church groups or service clubs
to travel together.
 &HT;    Some mature travelers are so adept at organizing groups that it
becomes something of a part-time business in which they develop
various travel clubs and produce newsletters.
 &HT;    Robert Rogers of Eureka Springs, Ark., started out hoping to
earn travel credits as a ``vacation ambassador'' for Grand Circle
Travel, (800) 597-2452. GCT ambassadors earn a $100 credit for each
of the first four travelers he or she recruits in a calendar year.
Starting with the fifth traveler, credits accumulate at a rate of
$150 per person. The credits can be cashed in for any future trip
offered by GCT.
 &HT;    Rogers' first encounter with Grand Circle occurred two years ago
when he took an all-inclusive trip to the Costa Del Sol. Rogers was
so impressed with the itinerary on that particular tour that he
recommended it to some of his friends, describing it as a ``totally
relaxing'' experience. His anecdotes about the days he spent on the
Mediterranean coast were enough to convince his friends to sign up.
He then made bookings for them.
 &HT;    Rogers was so successful with his inaugural referrals that when
the list grew to 12 friends, GCT designated him a group leader _ a
notch up from vacation ambassador _ earning him a complimentary
trip.
 &HT;    Like Rogers, Bob Jones of Coldchester, Conn., was able to
stretch his travel dollar by also becoming a group leader. After
retiring in 1994 from his job as branch manager of the American
Automobile Association, Jones refused to slow down. ``I am just too
active to do nothing,'' he said. That's when he began asking
friends if they wanted to start a travel club.
 &HT;    After about 75 percent of those he asked said, ``Yes,'' Jones
started organizing cruises for a local travel agency. It wasn't
long before he branched out, coordinating groups for GCT. His first
trip for GCT was to Mexico's Copper Canyon.
 &HT;    
 THE MORE, THE MERRIER  
 &HT;    The larger groups help pay Jones' travel expenses and provide a
way for him to include extras, such as renting a motor coach for
the group to ride together to the New York airport.
 &HT;    ``But once we were in New York, I didn't have to do a thing,''
he says. ``We had our own coach and guide. He handled every
detail.''
 &HT;    Jones says that organizing a travel group can incur some costs,
depending on the amount of energy one wishes to invest in
recruiting participants. For example, Jones opted to personally
mail out brochures. He also took care of receiving each traveler's
deposit and forwarding it to GCT. But, he says, ``After that, Grand
Circle took over ... I didn't even have to count the luggage or the
people _ not once.''
 &HT;    As Jones points out, ``Anyone who is outgoing should be able to
do this.'' He has even gone so far as to hold social gatherings at
his home, where he shows a travel film describing an upcoming
destination and serves coffee and snacks. ``Then it all seems to
happen by itself,'' he says.
 &HT;    Jones has also been a group leader with other travel companies,
including Brendan Tours, Holland America and TWA.
 &HT;    Marion Lothian of Lakehurst, N.J., thinks it's her attention to
detail that makes her trips extra special. In fact, she admits that
her desire for everything to ``be just right'' is the main reason
why she chooses to serve as the intermediary for each participant.
That means getting each deposit, collecting the rest of the
payment, organizing a bus to the airport and allocating tips for
baggage handlers and guides.
 &HT;    ``I want to take care of everything so they don't have to stick
their hands in their pockets for anything,'' she says.
 &HT;    Just before each trip, Lothian briefs her travelers so they know
what to wear, how to handle the money in the country they will
visit and what to do with their passports and visas. When the trip
is concluded, Lothian does her book work and IRS paperwork.
 &HT;    Lothian has worked with Vantage Deluxe World Travel, (800)
634-2180; Collette, (888) 344-5578; and GCT. She even developed her
own travel club in her community of 3,500 and serves as club
president. This past spring she organized tours to Scandinavia and
Spain.
 &HT;    
 WITH THE PERKS COMES WORK  
 &HT;    Lothian suggests that anyone who is thinking about becoming a
group travel leader should have a nice personality as well as ``a
strong sense of right and wrong and how to handle situations while
keeping their cool.
 &HT;    ``If they don't want to do the preparation or book work, they
shouldn't get involved because it is work and responsibility,'' she
adds.
 &HT;    Many travel brochures now spell out the details of group-travel
credits or comps. For example, Vantage Deluxe World Travel provides
a free trip, double occupancy, to group leaders for each group of
10 they recruit _ even if the leader doesn't travel with the group.
 &HT;    Immersia Travel, (800) 207-5454, offers a $1,000 savings for a
``group travel planner'' who gathers five travelers for a trip. A
complimentary trip is earned when the planner gathers 10 people.
For groups of 14 or more, the planner gets both a complimentary
trip and a $100-per-person rebate.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By LISA FUGARD  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    If birders go birding then those who seek out wildflowers surely
go flowering; the term botanizing doesn't begin to capture the
sweet delight I experienced on discovering the profusion of
wildflowers growing in the Burren in County Clare on Ireland's west
coast.
 &HT;    My romance with bird's-foot trefoil, mountain avens and herb
Robert came about by accident. When I flew into Shannon last July
and met my mother, Sheila, for a 10-day holiday, it was with the
intention of viewing shore birds and, with luck, a few seals.
 &HT;    Bleak and harsh are the adjectives often used to describe the
Burren, a roughly 100-square-mile limestone landscape of cliffs,
stony hills and broad stretches of rock resembling pavement. I have
an affinity for such landscapes, as does my mother, and the
boireann, the Irish word for rocky place, did not disappoint us.
 &HT;    Two and a half hours after leaving the airport in a
sardine-can-sized rental car, well suited to skinny country roads,
we crested a hill just above a stretch of coastline called Pol
Salach and saw a stunning panorama of fierce Ireland _ shattered
terraces of stark limestone spilling into a sea that was gray as
elephant skin.
 &HT;    We followed the coast road through the lonely village of Fanore
where horses grazed in rock-strewn pastures next to the beach, past
Black Head where the limestone cliffs plunged into the sea. Masses
of oxeye daisies and fuchsias blooming on the side of the road
softened the austere beauty of the rock.
 &HT;    By the time we reached Ballyvaughan, a tiny village sitting on a
tranquil corner of Galway Bay, we were enamored of the Burren.
Smoked salmon and mussels at Monk's Bar on the quay and two elegant
bedrooms in Rusheen Lodge, a four-star guest house, only added to
our satisfaction.
 &HT;    The next morning we drove into the hills behind Ballyvaughan
where flinty stone walls divided the land into pastures. I was
itching to walk among the rocks, but in planning the trip I had
promised my mother a ruin a day. My passion for the natural world
is matched by her passion for mosques, temples, tombs and ruined
churches. Such churches abound in the Burren, as do ring forts and
Neolithic tombs.
 &HT;    Our first visit was to the village of Kilfenora where the
tiniest medieval cathedral awaited us. The nave or front section is
still used for church services while the roofless chancel radiates
stillness and mystery. Two identical stone carvings _ apparently
the head of a bishop _ have a vaguely Egyptian air about them.
 &HT;    A delicate trefoil sedilia _ three seats crowned with a
beautifully carved pinnacle _ is recessed into one wall, while on
the adjacent wall are two naively incised 13th- and 14th-century
stone carvings.
 &HT;    One of them, supposedly of a cleric, had us perplexed. What did
the oval head and elongated neck remind us of? Where had we seen
that serene, otherworldly demeanor?
 &HT;    My mother, who is half Irish and has a streak of sly Irish wit
about her, solved that mystery when she exclaimed ``The Holy
Alien!''
 &HT;    Pelting rain and sudden squalls, rain that drizzles and mizzles
_ Ireland is one of the few countries where such weather is
shrugged off, hardly a deterrent to wildflower adventures.
 &HT;    After lunch I dropped my mother back at the B&AMP;B and, armed with
``Wild Plants of the Burren and the Aran Islands,'' bought at the
Burren Interpretive Center at Kilfenora, and a large umbrella
(which immediately marked me as a foreigner and a sissy), I drove
40 minutes along the coast road to rocky Pol Salach for my first
afternoon of flowering.
 &HT;    The great mystique of the flora of the Burren lies in its
diversity and its growing habits _ Mediterranean and arctic-alpine
plants thrive side by side. None of the species are unique to the
Burren, but many grow in the limestone landscape in greater
abundance than anywhere else in Ireland or Britain.
 &HT;    I parked the car, climbed over a low stone wall and crouched on
the ground. Crushing wild thyme between my fingers, I breathed
deep. I'd identified my first wildflower. And what were the tiny
white flowers intertwined with the thyme? I thumbed through my
flower book.
 &HT;    Yes! It was squinancy wort. After half an hour of literally
crawling through a cow pasture so ablaze with flowers it seemed as
though a beneficent fairy artist had dipped her paintbrush in
magenta, blue, yellow, cream and periwinkle blue and flicked it
over the ground, I reached the limestone pavement.
 &HT;    Smooth, relatively flat, rectangular chunks of limestone called
clints are separated from one another by fissures that range in
depth from one foot to 20. It's in these fissures, or grikes, that
the pluckiest of plants flourish. The magenta flowers of bloody
cranesbill swayed brightly against the bone-colored rock, and I saw
honeysuck le plants twisted into bonsais by the strong winds.
 &HT;    Closer to the sea cliffs I found those plants that thrive in the
salty spray gusting off Galway Bay _ bobbing heads of pink thrift
and sea campion and thick seaweedy-looking ferns that glistened in
the grikes. Of course, there were plants that I couldn't identify.
 &HT;    There are over 600 species recorded in the Burren. The book I
carried listed 120. I was momentarily frustrated. Then smiled. My
naming them didn't bring the flowers into being. Why not simply
enjoy them?
 &HT;    Our love affair with the Burren was now well under way, and the
following day while driving to Corcomroe, a Cistercian abbey that
lies five miles east of Ballyvaughan, my mother fantasized about
buying property. We parked at the end of a country lane and
immediately registered an eerie sound that seemed to be rising from
the ruined abbey. A ham-fisted ghost stumbling over the bass keys
of an organ?
 &HT;    After some investigation the Organist of Corcomroe, as he is now
affectionately remembered by my mother and me, turned out to be a
most handsome blond bull lowing to several docile black-and-white
cows cloistered in a field on the opposite side of the road.
 &HT;    While Kilfenora's chancel is exquisitely intimate, Corcomroe,
with the wind gusting through it, feels lonely and desolate. It
also has a stunning roof, as do most of the churches we visited,
with a wide swath of changeable Irish sky through which the rooks
wheeled and cawed. On some of the pillars the traces of carvings of
flowers can be found, a stony reminder of the abbey's other name,
Our Lady of the Fertile Rocks.
 &HT;    In one corner there is a recumbent effigy said to be that of an
O'Brien king killed nearby in 1267. Above it is an unfinished
14th-century carving, presumably of the abbot of Corcomroe. With a
hint of a smile on his face and rather puffy attire, he looks as
though he's levitating up the ruined chancel.
 &HT;    ``Three days is not enough time to explore the Burren,'' I
lamented over dinner that night in the superb Whitethorn
restaurant.
 &HT;    Reservations in Connemara awaited us, so the following day we
left for County Galway. On our way we stopped at Thoor Ballylee
near the town of Gort _ less than an hour's drive from Ballyvaughan
_ where Yeats summered from 1917 to 1929. The recorded commentary
issuing from speakers in his dining room, study and bedroom didn't
interest me so I climbed higher.
 &HT;    Close to the top of the stone tower I found what was surely the
true spirit of Yeats _ a soft-feathered, fierce-eyed kestrel
guarding her chick on a nest of sticks.
 &HT;    After two days in Connemara, during which time the sun blazed 16
hours a day and I swam in the stillest, bluest bay I'd ever seen,
gray clouds rolled in from the ocean. Rain spattered on the window
of our hotel. ``Only one place to be in such moody weather,'' I
said to my mother. Back to the Burren we raced.
 &HT;    Rusheen Lodge had been lovely, but I always feel as though I'm
staying in my grandparents' house when I visit a B &AMP; B. That
evening we checked into the Ballinalacken Castle Hotel, a sprawling
country house sitting on a hill just below a 15th-century O'Brien
tower house. The ruin is now roped off because too many visitors
were leaving with chunks of genuine Irish castle in their pockets.
 &HT;    We felt like Burren old-timers, and our remaining days took on
an easy routine. In the mornings we visited churches, castles and
towers. There was Dysert O'Dea, where a bizarre array of
Romanesque-style animal and human heads arches over the south
doorway of the church.
 &HT;    Lemaneagh Castle, worthy of at least a few ghosts, stands proud
in a stretch of windswept farmland (equally creepy was the electric
fence surrounding the field and the old Irish codger who scowled at
the few cars parked just beyond his land).
 &HT;    In Killinaboy we came across a humble ruined church with a
simple carving of the Crucifixion and the weathered Sheila na gig,
an ancient fertility symbol, above the entrance.
 &HT;    Each afternoon I went flowering. A walk up the Kyber Pass, a
road in Fanore that follows the Caher River _ the only surface
river in the Burren, as most of the rainwater seeps into the
underground waterways _ will be remembered as the afternoon I
discovered orchids.
 &HT;    Except for the exquisite bee orchid, the terrestrial species of
the Burren are not as showy as tropical orchids that cling to
trees. Still, I was captivated by their demure beauty.
 &HT;    On another day I went mad for ferns. I kept meaning to hike one
of the ancient green roads that lace the Burren; they're noted for
the wildflowers but I was smitten with rock, with the way a
saucer-sized depression on a boulder could hold an array of small
flowers brilliant as jewels, the way the wind gusting off Galway
Bay tossed the tousled pink flowers of hemp agrimony, a species
that grew en masse in the limestone fissures.
 &HT;    And then there was the food _ lobsters, crabs, black sole,
salmon, mussels. We feasted every evening at local restaurants and
returned to our hotel _ my mother had renamed it Fawlty Castle in
honor of the quirky yet utterly charming staff _ in time for sunset
tea, which, in early July, was at about 9 p.m.
 &HT;    On our last morning in the Burren I wandered the pavement at Pol
Salach, saying goodbye to yet another part of the world I'd fallen
in love with. My evening reading had been from a chapter in ``The
Burren: A Companion to the Wildflowers of an Irish Limestone
Wilderness'' that touched on the historical use of many of the
plants Id been rhapsodizing over, and as I whispered the names of
the flowers surrounding me, I felt as though I were floating back
in time.
 &HT;    Lady's bedstraw _ makes good bedding and can be used as a rennet
plant for curdling milk; squinancy wort _ useful if I ever get an
attack of quinsy; carline thistle _ preserve the buds with honey
and sugar for a tasty sweetmeat; Burnet rose _ I'll drink a syrup
made from the rosehips if I'm coughing, spitting blood or stricken
with scurvy.
 &HT;    The monks of Corcomroe must have put many of these plants to
medicinal use. Perhaps the levitating abbot secretly snacked on
carline thistles.
 &HT;    As for the Holy Alien? That otherworldly, rather blissful
demeanor might have come about from one too many afternoons spent
flowering.
 &HT;    -----
 SIDEBAR: REVELING IN BIRD'S-FOOT TREFOIL, SQUINANCY WORT AND
THRIFT  
 LODGING  
 &HT;    Rusheen Lodge. Just outside the village of Ballyvaughan, this
four-star guest house has six lovely, spacious rooms with private
bathrooms, and two suites. Doubles are $72; the suites $108, full
breakfast included, calculated at $1.21 to the Irish pound.
Telephone (353-65) 70 77092, fax (353-65) 70 77152.
 &HT;    Ballinalacken Castle Hotel. We loved this creaky yet elegant
hotel on the outskirts of Lisdoonvarna. Drinking tea in the sitting
room and sprawling about our spacious, rather oddly but grandly
decorated room made us feel like fading aristocrats. Some rooms
have splendid views of the Aran Islands, while others (nos. 5, 6,
10 and 11) do not. Doubles are $48 to $54, with full Irish
breakfast. For reservations, telephone or fax (353-65) 70 74025.
 DINING  
 &HT;    Sheedy's Hotel and Restaurant. What this restaurant in
Lisdoonvarna lacks in decor it makes up for with superb food. I had
an entree of black sole so exquisite I wonder if I'll ever eat fish
that fresh again. A three-course dinner for two, excluding drinks,
averages $60. Sheedy's bar has a seafood menu. Telephone (353-65)
70 74026.
 &HT;    The Whitethorn. Situated a half mile east of Ballyvaughan on the
coast road to Galway, this elegant restaurant has a stunning view
of Galway Bay. Dinner for two averages $70 and is served Friday and
Saturday nights only in July and August. Weekends and weekdays the
lunch service is buffet style and the food is just as delicious.
 &HT;    Attached is a shop crammed with good clothing, Irish crafts and
all the guidebooks needed to explore the Burren. Telephone (353-5)
70 77044.
 INFORMATION  
 &HT;    The Burren Interpretive Center at Kilfe nora, the first such
center in Ireland, has models and exhibits explaining the geology,
flora and fauna of the Burren, as well as an audiovisual lecture of
the area. Open daily 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. through September (to 5
p.m. October to May). Telephone (353-65) 70 88030. Admission $3.
 &HT;    Recommended reading: ``The Burren: a Companion to the
Wildflowers of an Irish Limestone Wilderness'' (Collins Press), by
E. Charles Nelson, who is utterly bewitched by the Burren. For help
in identifying flowers, pick up a copy of ``Wild Plants of the
Burren and the Aran Islands,'' also by E. Charles Nelson. Both
books are available at the Whitethorn and the Burren Interpretive
Center at Kilfenora.

SHOPPING AROUND: APRIL IN PARIS? WHY NOT?

 (Color slide included.) 
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Autumn may be the most delightful time to visit Paris, Rome and
many other European destinations. After all, most of the tourists
have gone home, museums have shorter lines and the weather can be
the best of the year.
 &HT;    Hotel prices, however, may not be that much lower than they are
in July and August because September and October are becoming
increasingly popular months to travel. But come late October,
prices do indeed fall.
 &HT;    For those considering a European getaway this autumn, here are
some planning tools.
 AIRFARES &AMP; PACKAGES  
 &HT;    Those who simply want a good, cheap airfare should look to
Expedia.com (www.expedia.com), Travelocity.com
(www.travelocity.com) and LowestFare.com (www.lowestfare.com),
which offer fare finders for thrifty travelers.
 &HT;    Another way to save money is with package deals that include
round-trip airfare, accommodations and transfers _ all for a single
price. Major American and European air carriers offer various
packages to Europe, but two carriers with extensive offerings are
British Airways (Holiday Desk, 75-20 Astoria Blvd., Jackson
Heights, NY 11370; 877-428-2228; www.britishairways.com) and
American Airlines (P.O. Box 619688, DFW Airport, Texas 75261;
800-882-8880; www.aa.com).
 &HT;    Package prices are fixed, and they're frequently available with
as little as seven days' advance notice. The best ones offer a
range of hotel choices, satisfying both budget-minded travelers and
those who want to splash out a little.
 ESCORTED TOURS  
 &HT;    For a single price, escorted tours provide airfare, hotel
accommodations, transfers, transportation as well as most meals,
sightseeing, baggage handling and taxes.
 &HT;    Fortunately, most tour companies no longer try to cram seven
countries into seven days. The smarter ones are tailoring their
trips to people who were brought up traveling independently.
 &HT;    The price can be right, because an escorted tour almost always
costs less than pricing components separately and it comes with the
added benefit of service.
 &HT;    Dozens of companies offer such tours to France, Spain and
virtually every country in Western and Eastern Europe. Travelers
can narrow their search by contacting the United States Tour
Operator Association (342 Madison Ave., Suite 1522, New York, NY
10173; 212-599-6599; www.ustoa.com).
 TRAINS  
 &HT;    Getting around Europe by train is easy. And the easiest way to
research European rail schedules and prices is to contact Rail
Europe (44 South Broadway, White Plains, NY 10601; 800-4-EURAIL;
www.raileurope.com), which also includes Brit Rail.
 &HT;    With a little work, smart travelers can determine whether it's
cheaper to buy point-to-point tickets or to go for a railpass _ or
perhaps decide that a rental car might be even cheaper if there are
enough people traveling together.
 &HT;    A basic Eurailpass costs $554 and provides 15 consecutive days
of unlimited first-class travel in the 17 member countries:
Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,
Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal,
Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.
 &HT;    But Rail Europe offers an array of regional and national passes,
in both first- and second-class versions. Many passes also come in
flexi-pass versions, since many travelers won't travel on every day
of their vacation.
 &HT;    A German Flexipass, for example, permits four days of travel in
a one-month period, for $252 in first class and $174 in second.
 &HT;    There are also passes that save two travelers money, like the
Swiss Saver Flexipass. It's $198 in first class and $132 in second
class, per person, for two travelers. They get three days of travel
within one month. Single travelers pay $234 and $156, respectively,
for these same passes.
 &HT;    Regional passes, such as the Europass, link France, Germany,
Italy, Spain and Switzerland. Rail Europe also offers a variety of
Eurostar tickets, for travel on the high-speed train between
Brussels, London and Paris.
 RENTALS  
 &HT;    Renting a European house or apartment for a week or more is
often an affordable way to go. That's true for a London apartment,
a Swiss chalet or a French villa.
 &HT;    Most renters will find that they get more space for their money,
even in a studio apartment, than at a comparable hotel.
 &HT;    Small homes and larger villas are suitable for families or
couples traveling together. In fact, when families or couples pool
their finances, renting can be a true cost-saver.
 &HT;    When looking for a rental, choose a property by location as well
as size and amenities. These companies offer a wide range of
European rentals:
 &HT;     The French Experience  (370 Lexington Ave., Suite 812, New
York, NY 10017; 212-986-3800; www.frenchexperience.com) has long
specialized in ``gites,'' rural vacation homes throughout the
French countryside.
 &HT;     Homes Away  (34 Park Road, Toronto M4W 2N4, Ontario, Canada;
800-374-6637; www.homesaway.com) has a handful of upscale rentals
in the most desirable areas of France and Italy.
 &HT;     The Landmark Trust  (707 Kipling Road, Dummerston, VT 05301;
802-254-6868; www.landmarktrust.co.uk) has a selection of unusual
rentals in period buildings throughout the British Isles.
 &HT;     Paris Sejours Reservations  (875 N. Michigan Ave., Suite 3214,
Chicago, IL 60611; 312-587-7707; www.PSRyourhomeinParis.com)
focuses on Paris apartments, from studios on up.
 &HT;     The Parker Company  (Seaport Landing, 152 Lynnway, Lynn, MA
01902; 800-280-2811; www.parkercompany.com) specializes in Italy.
 &HT;     WIMCO  (P.O. Box 1461, Newport, RI 02840; 800-932-3222;
www.wimcovillas.com) offers rentals in England, France, Ireland,
Italy and Scotland.

WHAT'S DOING IN PHILADELPHIA  
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>

 (Color slides and B&AMP;W map available.) 
 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By LAURA MANSNERUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Philadelphia has done everything it could think of for the
45,000 visitors expected at the Republican National Convention: its
landmark architecture is polished, its streetscapes groomed, its
hotels gleaming with restored marble and brass and stocked with
concierges.
 &HT;    But the convention is brief (July 31 through Aug. 3) and the
summer is long, making for many more weeks of prime tourism in the
nation's original convention city.
 &HT;    When you're inviting the whole country, it's good to have a city
full of walking opportunities. While the convention site, the First
Union Center, is in deep South Philadelphia, the restaurants,
shopping and historic sites are clustered in mercifully compact
Center City, a 15-minute subway or cab ride away.
 &HT;    There, in the two-mile stretch between rivers, the spines of
skyscrapers give way quickly to narrow, leafy residential streets
that make life easy for walkers, if not for traffic. A tourist
could spend a day just inspecting the courtyards and mews,
especially plentiful in the old neighborhoods east of Broad Street.
 &HT;    Philadelphia in summer is still the hot, placid city where
street life means corner taverns with open doors and row-house
stoops occupied by supervising grandparents. But with the dizzying
revival of Center City, another public life _ the kind involving
theater tickets and cell phones _ brings people out.
 &HT;    High summer is also the time to set sandals to the streets
around Independence Hall and see where the delegates to the First
and Second Continental Congresses sweltered. Or to explore the cool
halls of museums that have given their all to this summer's
exhibitions. Or to visit the rivers: the Delaware, with its night
life on the piers, and the more sedate Schuylkill, where the grassy
banks invite picnics and jogging.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    The city will greet the convention on its eve, July 30, with a
parade of 59 lighted boats at 9 p.m. and fireworks along the
Delaware. Penn's Landing and the New Jersey State Aquarium in
Camden are prime viewing spots. Information: (800) 770-5883.
 &HT;    You don't have to be a GOP delegate to get into PoliticalFest,
described as a world's fair of politics. It will have historical
and interactive (want to read from a teleprompter?) exhibits at the
Pennsylvania Convention Center, 12th and Arch Streets, July 26
through Aug. 3. Admission: $10 and $5 for students, ages 4 to 11
and 65 and older; (215) 686-0350.
 &HT;    And at the Atwater Kent Museum, 15 South Seventh St., the
exhibit ``Vote: Campaign Choices/Presidential Voices'' is showing
two centuries of campaign memorabilia until Nov. 26. Admission to
the Atwater Kent, Philadelphia's history museum, is $3, $2 for ages
55 and older and $1.50 for children 3 to 12. Information: (215)
922-3031.
 &HT;    The African American Museum in Philadelphia, 701 Arch St., (215)
574-0380, is celebrating the blues all summer. In addition to a
photography exhibition, through Sept. 3, the museum plans outdoor
lunch concerts on Wednesdays in July and August, with hip-hop,
zydeco and classical music represented, too. A second exhibit,
through Sept. 17, celebrates Paul Robeson. Admission: $6, $4 for
students, those aged 55 and older and the handicapped.
 &HT;    ``Andy Warhol: Social Observer'' is at the museum of the
Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Broad and Cherry Streets, (215)
972-7600, through Sept. 21. The show, including paintings of
Presidents Reagan and Nixon, Chairman Mao and Lenin, is the first
major exhibition of Warhol's work since 1988. Admission is $8, $7
for students and ages 60 and up, and $5 for ages 5 to 18.
 &HT;    On the streets or in the galleries, plastic cups of wine in
hand, people gather in Old City, just northeast of the Liberty
Bell, on First Fridays. This month, an extra Friday, July 28, will
accommodate convention visitors at the sprawling open house. About
40 art galleries, on Second and Third Streets, will open from 5
till 9 p.m. For information, call (215) 625-9200 or (800) 555-5191.
 &HT;    It's not Wrigley Field, but Veterans Stadium does have real
baseball, and it's next to the First Union Center. No matter what
they say about Philadelphia fans, the Vet is a friendly place. The
Phillies are home July 25 to July 30 (Chicago and Los Angeles),
Aug. 7 to Aug. 16 (San Diego, Houston and Arizona) and Aug. 25 to
Aug. 30 (San Francisco and Colorado). Tickets, $7 to $22.50;
information, (215) 463-1000.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    In a city that never runs out of material, the Foundation for
Architecture leads walking tours of about two hours five days a
week _ Saturday and Sunday at 2 p.m., and Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday evenings at 6.
 &HT;    A dozen offerings during the convention include ``20th Century
Unlimited,'' around Center Square, and ``Littlest Streets,'' along
the old, once-bohemian residential alleys of Washington Square
West. Adults $7, students $6; (215) 569-3187.
 &HT;    A different thread of history is on view at the hulking Eastern
State Penitentiary, 22nd Street and Fairmount Avenue. Eastern
State, one of the nation's first penitentiaries, opened in 1829 and
was home to Al Capone and Willie Sutton. The gothic stone monster
was only recently rescued from decades of decay and opened for
tours of Capone's specially furnished cell and other exhibits on
Wednesdays through Sundays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. in summer. The
fee is $7, $5 for students and ages 55 and up, and $3 for under 17.
Information, (215) 236-3300.
 &HT;    Walkers naturally seek out Society Hill, the core of
Philadelphia's original civic life and of its downtown revival 30
years ago. It's a genteel quarter, red brick from the sidewalks up,
encompassing Independence National Historic Park and dotted with
courtyards and churchyards, with many Georgian and Federal
buildings. But at its southern edge, South Street booms at night
with bars and quirky shops.
 &HT;    Across Society Hill's northern boundary, Market Street, is Old
City, which 20 years ago was a disused quarter of small, abandoned
garment factories with a few luncheonettes and a string of
restaurant-supply stores. The area is now packed with galleries,
coffeehouses, restaurants and clubs.
 &HT;    Runners can always put on shorts and head up the Benjamin
Franklin Parkway from Center City to the Philadelphia Museum of
Art. A jogging and bike path continues another four miles along the
Schuylkill, where the sights _ bridges, scullers, masses of willows
_ are pretty much as Thomas Eakins painted them more than 100 years
ago.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Philadelphia is booked for convention week, but the building
binge has ensured a tourists' market for most other weeks of the
summer and fall. To find out about hotel packages, including
tickets to cultural events, call a visitors' information number:
(888) 467-4452.
 &HT;    The Sheraton Society Hill, Second and Walnut Streets, has a
quiet, established niche in the historic district. Like its
surroundings, the low-rise red-brick hotel is Colonial (except for
the swimming pool) and sedate. The 365 traditional rooms and suites
range from $155 to $270 for a double. Reservations, (215) 238-6000,
fax (215) 238-6652.
 &HT;    A block from the convention center, Loews, 1200 Market St.,
(215) 627-1200, fax (215) 231-7305, is an Art Deco creation in an
old bank building (check out the vault doors). The 583 rooms are
pure 1930s luxe. A standard double is $175 to $240.
 &HT;    Just off Rittenhouse Square, the Sofitel, a part of the French
hotel chain, recently opened at 120 South 17th St., on a pleasingly
unreconstructed block of tiny shops. The hotel, by contrast, is all
modern and smooth, its 306 rooms furnished in gleaming woods and
geometric prints. Doubles, $189; (215) 569-8300, fax (215)
569-1492.
 &HT;    Budget: The Hawthorn Suites, 1100 Vine St., (215) 829-8300, fax
(215) 829-8104, is crisp and new, if a bit spare. Each of the 294
suites, at $149 to $159 (sometimes less on weekends), has
refrigerator, microwave and wet bar, making life easier for
families. At the northern edge of Center City, the hotel towers
over the convention center and Chinatown.
 &HT;    Luxury: The Park Hyatt Philadelphia at the Bellevue, Broad and
Walnut Streets, is rich in detail and history, a match for the
Academy of Music on the next corner of the theater district. With
just 172 rooms, including suites, it has a ballroom, a
conservatory, a rooftop rose garden and such amenities as a day
spa. Doubles start at $275; (215) 893-1234, fax (215) 732-8518.
 &HT;    Rittenhouse Bed and Breakfast, 1715 Rittenhouse Square, (215)
545-1755, fax (215) 545-1750, is as elegant as the neighboring
square, formal from its facade to its nightly shoeshine service.
Some of the 10 individually decorated rooms, all with baths, have
fireplaces and whirlpools. Rates are $220 to $340 and include full
breakfast.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    An anchor of Center City's restaurant row, Susanna Foo, 1512
Walnut St., (215) 545-2666, has done Asian fusion elegantly for
years. Under silk lanterns, diners can make their way from Chinese
soups and delicate dumplings to emphatically French desserts
(apricot tart with almond ice cream, for one). Dinner for two
people with wine, about $125.
 &HT;    Fishmarket, 122 South 18th St., (215) 569-9080, offers seafood
in a town house with just enough painted wood to feel like a crab
house. In fact, for the summer, the Fishmarket is making a big
production of crabs. Take a stool at the glistening raw bar at
happy hour and enjoy oysters for $1 each. Dinner for two, with a
bottle of wine, about $120. Closed Sunday.
 &HT;    Le Bar Lyonnais, 1523 Walnut St., (215) 567-1000, is the
downstairs wing of Le Bec-Fin, the French restaurant that has been
on national best-of lists for years. The bar offers many lighter
Bec-Fin standards like the galette de crabe and vichyssoise au
caviar at considerably lower prices. The atmosphere is rich, dark
and close -- it seats about 30. No reservations. Dinner for two
with drinks, about $100. Closed Sunday.
 &HT;    On the other side of Rittenhouse Square, Audrey Claire, (215)
731-1222, opens its wide windows at the corner of 20th and Spruce
Streets to a neighborhood of brownstones and small shops. The fare
is Mediterranean _ Audrey Claire is known for its grilled
flatbreads _ and simple. Outdoor tables available. No reservations
on Friday and Saturday. Bring your own wine. Dinner for two, about
$60. Closed Monday.
 &HT;    Effie's, at 1127 Pine St. on Antique Row, (215) 592-8333, is a
tiny Greek restaurant in a row house with a tiny, inviting garden.
Effie's has fresh fish every day, usually served whole, brushed
with lemon and olive oil and grilled. Bring your own wine. Dinner
for two, under $40.
 &HT;    For those who cannot leave town without a cheesesteak, the pure
South Philadelphia version is available at Pat's King of Steaks,
(215) 468-1546, or Geno's, (215) 389-0659, competing cholesterol
palaces at the intersection of Passyunk, South Ninth and Wharton
Streets.
 &HT;    And for South Philly pizza, try Marra's, 1734 East Passyunk
Ave., (215) 463-9249, now in its third generation. Wear a tank top
and bring $5 to $10 a person (that includes the beer).
 &HT;    A note about Pennsylvania dining: Most restaurants have liquor
licenses, but if you must bring your own, plan. Wine and liquor are
sold only in state stores, which are sparse, poorly stocked and
expensive. They are also not open late or on Sunday.

 BY MARY-LOU WEISMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    My husband, Larry, and I like to go house hunting on vacation.
One minute we are behaving like proper tourists in Provence, Sydney
or Prague, and the next we're making plans to live there. It's not
enough to be seeing the sites, enjoying the culture, eating the
food and drinking the wine; we have to own the place.
 &HT;    We travel the way Caesar's army conquered Gaul; we come, we see,
we acquire real estate _ at least in our dreams.
 &HT;    When in Rome, Larry imagines himself sitting all day outside his
apartment in the Piazza Navona. He is sipping cappuccino, reading a
book on architecture and smoking. (Larry resumes smoking on all of
his fantasy vacations.)
 &HT;    Larry does not have a job in Rome. I don't either, unless diving
for coins in the Trevi Fountain counts. In order to keep our
fantasy aloft, we have learned to avoid the little pinpricks of
reality such as how we're going to make a living, what we'll do for
friends, where to redeem our empty soda cans or what to do with our
children.
 &HT;    Not every vacation destination is good fantasy material. It may
be a nice place to visit, but even inveterate dreamers wouldn't
want to live there. Some places are too hot; some too cold. I'd be
cutting sod in Ireland right now if it weren't for the bloody rain.
 &HT;    We don't have many third-world real-estate fantasies. I hate to
think we could be so shallow, but it may be that our ability to
have a good fantasy is linked to the life expectancy and gross
national product of the country involved.
 &HT;    We once went on a ``trek'' in the Himalayas. I passed scores of
women who were also trekking, but they were doing it all day every
day, up and down the mountain carrying plastic buckets of water on
their heads.
 &HT;    The Nepalese fantasy outlook was a little more promising for
Larry. The men spent their days sitting cross-legged, playing
cards, smoking and growing stubble. Sure, I yearned to breathe that
pure mountain air on a permanent basis, and to see day break
gloriously each morning over Mount Everest _ but not with a bucket
on my head.
 &HT;    Paris is our favorite place in which to pretend to live. We've
almost bought real estate there several times. We don't care if the
French aren't friendly. When we are French, we won't be friendly
either.
 &HT;    I love to imagine who I'd be if I were French. I walk the
streets, giving the women the once-over, especially the femmes d'un
certain age, my age, middle age, to be precise.
 &HT;    Would I dare to slip into the skin of that flamboyantly hennaed
woman carrying the baguette, the one with the cheekbones, the
purple frock and the green kid heels that do not hurt her feet?
 &HT;    I imagine her on her way to the open-air market where she will
buy an armload of flowers and, on a whim, a canary in a cage. (I
don't like birds and have never wished to own one, but in Paris I
will.)
 &HT;    Larry the lawyer thinks he's that insouciant guy over there,
leaning against the archway rolling a Gauloise around between his
lips, letting the ash fall. Larry's fantasy involves frequent
visits to the Louvre, reading in the Tuileries, eating sweetbreads
and, in the summers, sailing off the coast of Normandy. (Larry
doesn't sail and we have lived for 30 years on Long Island Sound.)
 &HT;    After a few days of imagining ourselves French, we find we are
speaking French. That is to say, we are speaking our very own
spontaneous patois _ using French words when we can remember them,
and when we can't, speaking English with a French accent, like
Charles Boyer. But of course.
 &HT;    We eat a lot of sandwichs jambon. We return to the same cafe at
dusk. We discuss which of our favorite reds should be our house
wine. Thus Frenchified, we feel that the time is right to find our
fantasy home.
 &HT;    Invariably, on one of our many delightfully aimless walks, we
find ourselves in front of a real-estate office. We examine the
photographs on display in the window. Do we want a house or an
apartment? Should we louer or acheter? The Left Bank, of course,
but quelle arrondissement?
 &HT;    Larry, whose favorite opera is ``La Boheme,'' would like
something in the way of a garret, with a dormer window and chimney
pots. And a sink in the corner. I'm not fussy, as long as there's a
place for my canary.
 &HT;    But can we afford it? Larry converts the various asking prices
from francs into dollars. These conversions are followed by a
pause, which is long and weighty enough to indicate that we are
giving sober consideration to the matter.
 &HT;    Then he speaks the words that let me know we've got a
full-fledged fantasy on our hands: ``I wonder how much we could get
for our house?'' We've got lift-off.
 &HT;    It is embarrassing to think about the trail of aborted rental
and purchase agreements we have left in our wake. In St.-Remy it
was ``Small house in town with irises and cyprus trees''; in
Katmandu ``Renovated monastery cell''; in Jackson Hole ``Log cabin,
Teton backdrop''; in the Cotswolds ``One-bedroom cottage,
thatched.''
 &HT;    How easily we betray our real lives in our dreams! How heedless
of the time and energy we put into home, community and friends,
never mind love of country. Vacation fantasizing is a lot like a
midlife crisis. You want to dump your old life and marry some place
new.
 &HT;    We are not the innocent, faithful children we once were. We
don't call out a fond, ``Goodbye house, goodbye door, goodbye
steps, goodbye lawn'' as we back down the driveway. Instead, it's
``Lemme outa here'' as we make our escape, pursued by a swarm of
stress: Did I change the message on the answering machine? Do I
have my passport? Did I hold the mail, pay the bills, call off the
newspaper, program the VCR, turn down the thermostat, straighten my
sock drawer, review my will, forget the tickets, remember the
Xanax? Who wouldn't want to live somewhere else?
 &HT;    Most of the time we're pretty good at keeping fantasy in its
place. Of course we're not going to live in a garret in Paris.
We're just playing house. We've learned our lesson the hard way.
Whenever we have tried to mix fantasy with reality, the gods have
exacted their price. It can be paid in either cash or humiliation.
 &HT;    After a particularly pleasant vacation in London a few years
ago, we resisted the temptation to buy a flat and settled for
buying a London cab. At the time, cabs that had been retired from
service were sold at a garage near Elephant and Castle. Ours had
over 300,000 miles on it. It had a running board. It was full of
quaint advertisements. The seat flipped down. The meter worked. We
 &HT;    imagined what fun we'd have picking up our friends for dinner
and the movies.
 &HT;    Once home, we waited eagerly for the word from Hoboken that our
taxi had arrived. When Larry claimed it at the dock, he and three
guys with tattoos had to push it to get it started. Then the wheels
fell off. The customs inspector felt so sorry for Larry he refused
to charge him any duty.
 &HT;    On yet another occasion we trespassed the threshold between
fantasy and reality big time. It was the '70s, and we were young
and idealistic. We moved from Connecticut to Big Sur, Calif., on
the strength of a two-week stay at the Esalen Institute, where I
was convinced that I could actualize my human potential by pounding
on a pillow and hugging strangers.
 &HT;    It's not as if our friends didn't try to warn us. One of them
did his best to stop us, but we stubbornly refused to get the
point.
 &HT;    ``Haven't you ever had a fantasy about living a better life in
another place?'' I challenged him.
 &HT;    ``Of course I have. I even have a favorite fantasy. I want to
move to London and hire out as a butler in a well-appointed home.''
 &HT;    ``Well then why don't you do it?'' I said.
 &HT;    ``Because then I wouldn't have it as a fantasy any more.''
 &HT;    For an entire year I was a California mountain woman. I
earnestly eschewed brassieres in favor of black leotards. I wore
long paisley skirts that could double as tablecloths, tied at the
waist. I grew all my hair. I made my own granola. I said ``far
out.'' But no matter what I did or how hard I pounded, I was still
from the Northeast.
 &HT;    Larry, who is better than I am at making the best of a bad deal,
smoked a lot and volunteered as a model for the massage class. When
we finally got home and slipped back into reality we vowed we'd
never, ever again lose our grip on fantasy.

 By ADELE MALOTT 
 Condensed from The Mature Traveler Newsletter 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Many travel companies now offer their budget-conscious and
entrepreneurial customers a way to save money on their trips _
sometimes as much as the full price of an airline ticket or the
entire cost of a tour.
 &HT;    The secret? Become a group travel leader. As the name implies,
group travel leaders earn their savings by recruiting friends,
neighbors or people they know from church groups or service clubs
to travel together.
 &HT;    Some mature travelers are so adept at organizing groups that it
becomes something of a part-time business in which they develop
various travel clubs and produce newsletters.
 &HT;    Robert Rogers of Eureka Springs, Ark., started out hoping to
earn travel credits as a ``vacation ambassador'' for Grand Circle
Travel, (800) 597-2452. GCT ambassadors earn a $100 credit for each
of the first four travelers he or she recruits in a calendar year.
Starting with the fifth traveler, credits accumulate at a rate of
$150 per person. The credits can be cashed in for any future trip
offered by GCT.
 &HT;    Rogers' first encounter with Grand Circle occurred two years ago
when he took an all-inclusive trip to the Costa Del Sol. Rogers was
so impressed with the itinerary on that particular tour that he
recommended it to some of his friends, describing it as a ``totally
relaxing'' experience. His anecdotes about the days he spent on the
Mediterranean coast were enough to convince his friends to sign up.
He then made bookings for them.
 &HT;    Rogers was so successful with his inaugural referrals that when
the list grew to 12 friends, GCT designated him a group leader _ a
notch up from vacation ambassador _ earning him a complimentary
trip.
 &HT;    Like Rogers, Bob Jones of Coldchester, Conn., was able to
stretch his travel dollar by also becoming a group leader. After
retiring in 1994 from his job as branch manager of the American
Automobile Association, Jones refused to slow down. ``I am just too
active to do nothing,'' he said. That's when he began asking
friends if they wanted to start a travel club.
 &HT;    After about 75 percent of those he asked said, ``Yes,'' Jones
started organizing cruises for a local travel agency. It wasn't
long before he branched out, coordinating groups for GCT. His first
trip for GCT was to Mexico's Copper Canyon.
 &HT;    
 THE MORE, THE MERRIER  
 &HT;    The larger groups help pay Jones' travel expenses and provide a
way for him to include extras, such as renting a motor coach for
the group to ride together to the New York airport.
 &HT;    ``But once we were in New York, I didn't have to do a thing,''
he says. ``We had our own coach and guide. He handled every
detail.''
 &HT;    Jones says that organizing a travel group can incur some costs,
depending on the amount of energy one wishes to invest in
recruiting participants. For example, Jones opted to personally
mail out brochures. He also took care of receiving each traveler's
deposit and forwarding it to GCT. But, he says, ``After that, Grand
Circle took over ... I didn't even have to count the luggage or the
people _ not once.''
 &HT;    As Jones points out, ``Anyone who is outgoing should be able to
do this.'' He has even gone so far as to hold social gatherings at
his home, where he shows a travel film describing an upcoming
destination and serves coffee and snacks. ``Then it all seems to
happen by itself,'' he says.
 &HT;    Jones has also been a group leader with other travel companies,
including Brendan Tours, Holland America and TWA.
 &HT;    Marion Lothian of Lakehurst, N.J., thinks it's her attention to
detail that makes her trips extra special. In fact, she admits that
her desire for everything to ``be just right'' is the main reason
why she chooses to serve as the intermediary for each participant.
That means getting each deposit, collecting the rest of the
payment, organizing a bus to the airport and allocating tips for
baggage handlers and guides.
 &HT;    ``I want to take care of everything so they don't have to stick
their hands in their pockets for anything,'' she says.
 &HT;    Just before each trip, Lothian briefs her travelers so they know
what to wear, how to handle the money in the country they will
visit and what to do with their passports and visas. When the trip
is concluded, Lothian does her book work and IRS paperwork.
 &HT;    Lothian has worked with Vantage Deluxe World Travel, (800)
634-2180; Collette, (888) 344-5578; and GCT. She even developed her
own travel club in her community of 3,500 and serves as club
president. This past spring she organized tours to Scandinavia and
Spain.
 &HT;    
 WITH THE PERKS COMES WORK  
 &HT;    Lothian suggests that anyone who is thinking about becoming a
group travel leader should have a nice personality as well as ``a
strong sense of right and wrong and how to handle situations while
keeping their cool.
 &HT;    ``If they don't want to do the preparation or book work, they
shouldn't get involved because it is work and responsibility,'' she
adds.
 &HT;    Many travel brochures now spell out the details of group-travel
credits or comps. For example, Vantage Deluxe World Travel provides
a free trip, double occupancy, to group leaders for each group of
10 they recruit _ even if the leader doesn't travel with the group.
 &HT;    Immersia Travel, (800) 207-5454, offers a $1,000 savings for a
``group travel planner'' who gathers five travelers for a trip. A
complimentary trip is earned when the planner gathers 10 people.
For groups of 14 or more, the planner gets both a complimentary
trip and a $100-per-person rebate.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By LISA FUGARD  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    If birders go birding then those who seek out wildflowers surely
go flowering; the term botanizing doesn't begin to capture the
sweet delight I experienced on discovering the profusion of
wildflowers growing in the Burren in County Clare on Ireland's west
coast.
 &HT;    My romance with bird's-foot trefoil, mountain avens and herb
Robert came about by accident. When I flew into Shannon last July
and met my mother, Sheila, for a 10-day holiday, it was with the
intention of viewing shore birds and, with luck, a few seals.
 &HT;    Bleak and harsh are the adjectives often used to describe the
Burren, a roughly 100-square-mile limestone landscape of cliffs,
stony hills and broad stretches of rock resembling pavement. I have
an affinity for such landscapes, as does my mother, and the
boireann, the Irish word for rocky place, did not disappoint us.
 &HT;    Two and a half hours after leaving the airport in a
sardine-can-sized rental car, well suited to skinny country roads,
we crested a hill just above a stretch of coastline called Pol
Salach and saw a stunning panorama of fierce Ireland _ shattered
terraces of stark limestone spilling into a sea that was gray as
elephant skin.
 &HT;    We followed the coast road through the lonely village of Fanore
where horses grazed in rock-strewn pastures next to the beach, past
Black Head where the limestone cliffs plunged into the sea. Masses
of oxeye daisies and fuchsias blooming on the side of the road
softened the austere beauty of the rock.
 &HT;    By the time we reached Ballyvaughan, a tiny village sitting on a
tranquil corner of Galway Bay, we were enamored of the Burren.
Smoked salmon and mussels at Monk's Bar on the quay and two elegant
bedrooms in Rusheen Lodge, a four-star guest house, only added to
our satisfaction.
 &HT;    The next morning we drove into the hills behind Ballyvaughan
where flinty stone walls divided the land into pastures. I was
itching to walk among the rocks, but in planning the trip I had
promised my mother a ruin a day. My passion for the natural world
is matched by her passion for mosques, temples, tombs and ruined
churches. Such churches abound in the Burren, as do ring forts and
Neolithic tombs.
 &HT;    Our first visit was to the village of Kilfenora where the
tiniest medieval cathedral awaited us. The nave or front section is
still used for church services while the roofless chancel radiates
stillness and mystery. Two identical stone carvings _ apparently
the head of a bishop _ have a vaguely Egyptian air about them.
 &HT;    A delicate trefoil sedilia _ three seats crowned with a
beautifully carved pinnacle _ is recessed into one wall, while on
the adjacent wall are two naively incised 13th- and 14th-century
stone carvings.
 &HT;    One of them, supposedly of a cleric, had us perplexed. What did
the oval head and elongated neck remind us of? Where had we seen
that serene, otherworldly demeanor?
 &HT;    My mother, who is half Irish and has a streak of sly Irish wit
about her, solved that mystery when she exclaimed ``The Holy
Alien!''
 &HT;    Pelting rain and sudden squalls, rain that drizzles and mizzles
_ Ireland is one of the few countries where such weather is
shrugged off, hardly a deterrent to wildflower adventures.
 &HT;    After lunch I dropped my mother back at the B&AMP;B and, armed with
``Wild Plants of the Burren and the Aran Islands,'' bought at the
Burren Interpretive Center at Kilfenora, and a large umbrella
(which immediately marked me as a foreigner and a sissy), I drove
40 minutes along the coast road to rocky Pol Salach for my first
afternoon of flowering.
 &HT;    The great mystique of the flora of the Burren lies in its
diversity and its growing habits _ Mediterranean and arctic-alpine
plants thrive side by side. None of the species are unique to the
Burren, but many grow in the limestone landscape in greater
abundance than anywhere else in Ireland or Britain.
 &HT;    I parked the car, climbed over a low stone wall and crouched on
the ground. Crushing wild thyme between my fingers, I breathed
deep. I'd identified my first wildflower. And what were the tiny
white flowers intertwined with the thyme? I thumbed through my
flower book.
 &HT;    Yes! It was squinancy wort. After half an hour of literally
crawling through a cow pasture so ablaze with flowers it seemed as
though a beneficent fairy artist had dipped her paintbrush in
magenta, blue, yellow, cream and periwinkle blue and flicked it
over the ground, I reached the limestone pavement.
 &HT;    Smooth, relatively flat, rectangular chunks of limestone called
clints are separated from one another by fissures that range in
depth from one foot to 20. It's in these fissures, or grikes, that
the pluckiest of plants flourish. The magenta flowers of bloody
cranesbill swayed brightly against the bone-colored rock, and I saw
honeysuck le plants twisted into bonsais by the strong winds.
 &HT;    Closer to the sea cliffs I found those plants that thrive in the
salty spray gusting off Galway Bay _ bobbing heads of pink thrift
and sea campion and thick seaweedy-looking ferns that glistened in
the grikes. Of course, there were plants that I couldn't identify.
 &HT;    There are over 600 species recorded in the Burren. The book I
carried listed 120. I was momentarily frustrated. Then smiled. My
naming them didn't bring the flowers into being. Why not simply
enjoy them?
 &HT;    Our love affair with the Burren was now well under way, and the
following day while driving to Corcomroe, a Cistercian abbey that
lies five miles east of Ballyvaughan, my mother fantasized about
buying property. We parked at the end of a country lane and
immediately registered an eerie sound that seemed to be rising from
the ruined abbey. A ham-fisted ghost stumbling over the bass keys
of an organ?
 &HT;    After some investigation the Organist of Corcomroe, as he is now
affectionately remembered by my mother and me, turned out to be a
most handsome blond bull lowing to several docile black-and-white
cows cloistered in a field on the opposite side of the road.
 &HT;    While Kilfenora's chancel is exquisitely intimate, Corcomroe,
with the wind gusting through it, feels lonely and desolate. It
also has a stunning roof, as do most of the churches we visited,
with a wide swath of changeable Irish sky through which the rooks
wheeled and cawed. On some of the pillars the traces of carvings of
flowers can be found, a stony reminder of the abbey's other name,
Our Lady of the Fertile Rocks.
 &HT;    In one corner there is a recumbent effigy said to be that of an
O'Brien king killed nearby in 1267. Above it is an unfinished
14th-century carving, presumably of the abbot of Corcomroe. With a
hint of a smile on his face and rather puffy attire, he looks as
though he's levitating up the ruined chancel.
 &HT;    ``Three days is not enough time to explore the Burren,'' I
lamented over dinner that night in the superb Whitethorn
restaurant.
 &HT;    Reservations in Connemara awaited us, so the following day we
left for County Galway. On our way we stopped at Thoor Ballylee
near the town of Gort _ less than an hour's drive from Ballyvaughan
_ where Yeats summered from 1917 to 1929. The recorded commentary
issuing from speakers in his dining room, study and bedroom didn't
interest me so I climbed higher.
 &HT;    Close to the top of the stone tower I found what was surely the
true spirit of Yeats _ a soft-feathered, fierce-eyed kestrel
guarding her chick on a nest of sticks.
 &HT;    After two days in Connemara, during which time the sun blazed 16
hours a day and I swam in the stillest, bluest bay I'd ever seen,
gray clouds rolled in from the ocean. Rain spattered on the window
of our hotel. ``Only one place to be in such moody weather,'' I
said to my mother. Back to the Burren we raced.
 &HT;    Rusheen Lodge had been lovely, but I always feel as though I'm
staying in my grandparents' house when I visit a B &AMP; B. That
evening we checked into the Ballinalacken Castle Hotel, a sprawling
country house sitting on a hill just below a 15th-century O'Brien
tower house. The ruin is now roped off because too many visitors
were leaving with chunks of genuine Irish castle in their pockets.
 &HT;    We felt like Burren old-timers, and our remaining days took on
an easy routine. In the mornings we visited churches, castles and
towers. There was Dysert O'Dea, where a bizarre array of
Romanesque-style animal and human heads arches over the south
doorway of the church.
 &HT;    Lemaneagh Castle, worthy of at least a few ghosts, stands proud
in a stretch of windswept farmland (equally creepy was the electric
fence surrounding the field and the old Irish codger who scowled at
the few cars parked just beyond his land).
 &HT;    In Killinaboy we came across a humble ruined church with a
simple carving of the Crucifixion and the weathered Sheila na gig,
an ancient fertility symbol, above the entrance.
 &HT;    Each afternoon I went flowering. A walk up the Kyber Pass, a
road in Fanore that follows the Caher River _ the only surface
river in the Burren, as most of the rainwater seeps into the
underground waterways _ will be remembered as the afternoon I
discovered orchids.
 &HT;    Except for the exquisite bee orchid, the terrestrial species of
the Burren are not as showy as tropical orchids that cling to
trees. Still, I was captivated by their demure beauty.
 &HT;    On another day I went mad for ferns. I kept meaning to hike one
of the ancient green roads that lace the Burren; they're noted for
the wildflowers but I was smitten with rock, with the way a
saucer-sized depression on a boulder could hold an array of small
flowers brilliant as jewels, the way the wind gusting off Galway
Bay tossed the tousled pink flowers of hemp agrimony, a species
that grew en masse in the limestone fissures.
 &HT;    And then there was the food _ lobsters, crabs, black sole,
salmon, mussels. We feasted every evening at local restaurants and
returned to our hotel _ my mother had renamed it Fawlty Castle in
honor of the quirky yet utterly charming staff _ in time for sunset
tea, which, in early July, was at about 9 p.m.
 &HT;    On our last morning in the Burren I wandered the pavement at Pol
Salach, saying goodbye to yet another part of the world I'd fallen
in love with. My evening reading had been from a chapter in ``The
Burren: A Companion to the Wildflowers of an Irish Limestone
Wilderness'' that touched on the historical use of many of the
plants Id been rhapsodizing over, and as I whispered the names of
the flowers surrounding me, I felt as though I were floating back
in time.
 &HT;    Lady's bedstraw _ makes good bedding and can be used as a rennet
plant for curdling milk; squinancy wort _ useful if I ever get an
attack of quinsy; carline thistle _ preserve the buds with honey
and sugar for a tasty sweetmeat; Burnet rose _ I'll drink a syrup
made from the rosehips if I'm coughing, spitting blood or stricken
with scurvy.
 &HT;    The monks of Corcomroe must have put many of these plants to
medicinal use. Perhaps the levitating abbot secretly snacked on
carline thistles.
 &HT;    As for the Holy Alien? That otherworldly, rather blissful
demeanor might have come about from one too many afternoons spent
flowering.
 &HT;    -----
 SIDEBAR: REVELING IN BIRD'S-FOOT TREFOIL, SQUINANCY WORT AND
THRIFT  
 LODGING  
 &HT;    Rusheen Lodge. Just outside the village of Ballyvaughan, this
four-star guest house has six lovely, spacious rooms with private
bathrooms, and two suites. Doubles are $72; the suites $108, full
breakfast included, calculated at $1.21 to the Irish pound.
Telephone (353-65) 70 77092, fax (353-65) 70 77152.
 &HT;    Ballinalacken Castle Hotel. We loved this creaky yet elegant
hotel on the outskirts of Lisdoonvarna. Drinking tea in the sitting
room and sprawling about our spacious, rather oddly but grandly
decorated room made us feel like fading aristocrats. Some rooms
have splendid views of the Aran Islands, while others (nos. 5, 6,
10 and 11) do not. Doubles are $48 to $54, with full Irish
breakfast. For reservations, telephone or fax (353-65) 70 74025.
 DINING  
 &HT;    Sheedy's Hotel and Restaurant. What this restaurant in
Lisdoonvarna lacks in decor it makes up for with superb food. I had
an entree of black sole so exquisite I wonder if I'll ever eat fish
that fresh again. A three-course dinner for two, excluding drinks,
averages $60. Sheedy's bar has a seafood menu. Telephone (353-65)
70 74026.
 &HT;    The Whitethorn. Situated a half mile east of Ballyvaughan on the
coast road to Galway, this elegant restaurant has a stunning view
of Galway Bay. Dinner for two averages $70 and is served Friday and
Saturday nights only in July and August. Weekends and weekdays the
lunch service is buffet style and the food is just as delicious.
 &HT;    Attached is a shop crammed with good clothing, Irish crafts and
all the guidebooks needed to explore the Burren. Telephone (353-5)
70 77044.
 INFORMATION  
 &HT;    The Burren Interpretive Center at Kilfe nora, the first such
center in Ireland, has models and exhibits explaining the geology,
flora and fauna of the Burren, as well as an audiovisual lecture of
the area. Open daily 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. through September (to 5
p.m. October to May). Telephone (353-65) 70 88030. Admission $3.
 &HT;    Recommended reading: ``The Burren: a Companion to the
Wildflowers of an Irish Limestone Wilderness'' (Collins Press), by
E. Charles Nelson, who is utterly bewitched by the Burren. For help
in identifying flowers, pick up a copy of ``Wild Plants of the
Burren and the Aran Islands,'' also by E. Charles Nelson. Both
books are available at the Whitethorn and the Burren Interpretive
Center at Kilfenora.

SHOPPING AROUND: APRIL IN PARIS? WHY NOT?

 (Color slide included.) 
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Autumn may be the most delightful time to visit Paris, Rome and
many other European destinations. After all, most of the tourists
have gone home, museums have shorter lines and the weather can be
the best of the year.
 &HT;    Hotel prices, however, may not be that much lower than they are
in July and August because September and October are becoming
increasingly popular months to travel. But come late October,
prices do indeed fall.
 &HT;    For those considering a European getaway this autumn, here are
some planning tools.
 AIRFARES &AMP; PACKAGES  
 &HT;    Those who simply want a good, cheap airfare should look to
Expedia.com (www.expedia.com), Travelocity.com
(www.travelocity.com) and LowestFare.com (www.lowestfare.com),
which offer fare finders for thrifty travelers.
 &HT;    Another way to save money is with package deals that include
round-trip airfare, accommodations and transfers _ all for a single
price. Major American and European air carriers offer various
packages to Europe, but two carriers with extensive offerings are
British Airways (Holiday Desk, 75-20 Astoria Blvd., Jackson
Heights, NY 11370; 877-428-2228; www.britishairways.com) and
American Airlines (P.O. Box 619688, DFW Airport, Texas 75261;
800-882-8880; www.aa.com).
 &HT;    Package prices are fixed, and they're frequently available with
as little as seven days' advance notice. The best ones offer a
range of hotel choices, satisfying both budget-minded travelers and
those who want to splash out a little.
 ESCORTED TOURS  
 &HT;    For a single price, escorted tours provide airfare, hotel
accommodations, transfers, transportation as well as most meals,
sightseeing, baggage handling and taxes.
 &HT;    Fortunately, most tour companies no longer try to cram seven
countries into seven days. The smarter ones are tailoring their
trips to people who were brought up traveling independently.
 &HT;    The price can be right, because an escorted tour almost always
costs less than pricing components separately and it comes with the
added benefit of service.
 &HT;    Dozens of companies offer such tours to France, Spain and
virtually every country in Western and Eastern Europe. Travelers
can narrow their search by contacting the United States Tour
Operator Association (342 Madison Ave., Suite 1522, New York, NY
10173; 212-599-6599; www.ustoa.com).
 TRAINS  
 &HT;    Getting around Europe by train is easy. And the easiest way to
research European rail schedules and prices is to contact Rail
Europe (44 South Broadway, White Plains, NY 10601; 800-4-EURAIL;
www.raileurope.com), which also includes Brit Rail.
 &HT;    With a little work, smart travelers can determine whether it's
cheaper to buy point-to-point tickets or to go for a railpass _ or
perhaps decide that a rental car might be even cheaper if there are
enough people traveling together.
 &HT;    A basic Eurailpass costs $554 and provides 15 consecutive days
of unlimited first-class travel in the 17 member countries:
Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,
Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal,
Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.
 &HT;    But Rail Europe offers an array of regional and national passes,
in both first- and second-class versions. Many passes also come in
flexi-pass versions, since many travelers won't travel on every day
of their vacation.
 &HT;    A German Flexipass, for example, permits four days of travel in
a one-month period, for $252 in first class and $174 in second.
 &HT;    There are also passes that save two travelers money, like the
Swiss Saver Flexipass. It's $198 in first class and $132 in second
class, per person, for two travelers. They get three days of travel
within one month. Single travelers pay $234 and $156, respectively,
for these same passes.
 &HT;    Regional passes, such as the Europass, link France, Germany,
Italy, Spain and Switzerland. Rail Europe also offers a variety of
Eurostar tickets, for travel on the high-speed train between
Brussels, London and Paris.
 RENTALS  
 &HT;    Renting a European house or apartment for a week or more is
often an affordable way to go. That's true for a London apartment,
a Swiss chalet or a French villa.
 &HT;    Most renters will find that they get more space for their money,
even in a studio apartment, than at a comparable hotel.
 &HT;    Small homes and larger villas are suitable for families or
couples traveling together. In fact, when families or couples pool
their finances, renting can be a true cost-saver.
 &HT;    When looking for a rental, choose a property by location as well
as size and amenities. These companies offer a wide range of
European rentals:
 &HT;     The French Experience  (370 Lexington Ave., Suite 812, New
York, NY 10017; 212-986-3800; www.frenchexperience.com) has long
specialized in ``gites,'' rural vacation homes throughout the
French countryside.
 &HT;     Homes Away  (34 Park Road, Toronto M4W 2N4, Ontario, Canada;
800-374-6637; www.homesaway.com) has a handful of upscale rentals
in the most desirable areas of France and Italy.
 &HT;     The Landmark Trust  (707 Kipling Road, Dummerston, VT 05301;
802-254-6868; www.landmarktrust.co.uk) has a selection of unusual
rentals in period buildings throughout the British Isles.
 &HT;     Paris Sejours Reservations  (875 N. Michigan Ave., Suite 3214,
Chicago, IL 60611; 312-587-7707; www.PSRyourhomeinParis.com)
focuses on Paris apartments, from studios on up.
 &HT;     The Parker Company  (Seaport Landing, 152 Lynnway, Lynn, MA
01902; 800-280-2811; www.parkercompany.com) specializes in Italy.
 &HT;     WIMCO  (P.O. Box 1461, Newport, RI 02840; 800-932-3222;
www.wimcovillas.com) offers rentals in England, France, Ireland,
Italy and Scotland.

WHAT'S DOING IN PHILADELPHIA  
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>

 (Color slides and B&AMP;W map available.) 
 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By LAURA MANSNERUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Philadelphia has done everything it could think of for the
45,000 visitors expected at the Republican National Convention: its
landmark architecture is polished, its streetscapes groomed, its
hotels gleaming with restored marble and brass and stocked with
concierges.
 &HT;    But the convention is brief (July 31 through Aug. 3) and the
summer is long, making for many more weeks of prime tourism in the
nation's original convention city.
 &HT;    When you're inviting the whole country, it's good to have a city
full of walking opportunities. While the convention site, the First
Union Center, is in deep South Philadelphia, the restaurants,
shopping and historic sites are clustered in mercifully compact
Center City, a 15-minute subway or cab ride away.
 &HT;    There, in the two-mile stretch between rivers, the spines of
skyscrapers give way quickly to narrow, leafy residential streets
that make life easy for walkers, if not for traffic. A tourist
could spend a day just inspecting the courtyards and mews,
especially plentiful in the old neighborhoods east of Broad Street.
 &HT;    Philadelphia in summer is still the hot, placid city where
street life means corner taverns with open doors and row-house
stoops occupied by supervising grandparents. But with the dizzying
revival of Center City, another public life _ the kind involving
theater tickets and cell phones _ brings people out.
 &HT;    High summer is also the time to set sandals to the streets
around Independence Hall and see where the delegates to the First
and Second Continental Congresses sweltered. Or to explore the cool
halls of museums that have given their all to this summer's
exhibitions. Or to visit the rivers: the Delaware, with its night
life on the piers, and the more sedate Schuylkill, where the grassy
banks invite picnics and jogging.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    The city will greet the convention on its eve, July 30, with a
parade of 59 lighted boats at 9 p.m. and fireworks along the
Delaware. Penn's Landing and the New Jersey State Aquarium in
Camden are prime viewing spots. Information: (800) 770-5883.
 &HT;    You don't have to be a GOP delegate to get into PoliticalFest,
described as a world's fair of politics. It will have historical
and interactive (want to read from a teleprompter?) exhibits at the
Pennsylvania Convention Center, 12th and Arch Streets, July 26
through Aug. 3. Admission: $10 and $5 for students, ages 4 to 11
and 65 and older; (215) 686-0350.
 &HT;    And at the Atwater Kent Museum, 15 South Seventh St., the
exhibit ``Vote: Campaign Choices/Presidential Voices'' is showing
two centuries of campaign memorabilia until Nov. 26. Admission to
the Atwater Kent, Philadelphia's history museum, is $3, $2 for ages
55 and older and $1.50 for children 3 to 12. Information: (215)
922-3031.
 &HT;    The African American Museum in Philadelphia, 701 Arch St., (215)
574-0380, is celebrating the blues all summer. In addition to a
photography exhibition, through Sept. 3, the museum plans outdoor
lunch concerts on Wednesdays in July and August, with hip-hop,
zydeco and classical music represented, too. A second exhibit,
through Sept. 17, celebrates Paul Robeson. Admission: $6, $4 for
students, those aged 55 and older and the handicapped.
 &HT;    ``Andy Warhol: Social Observer'' is at the museum of the
Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Broad and Cherry Streets, (215)
972-7600, through Sept. 21. The show, including paintings of
Presidents Reagan and Nixon, Chairman Mao and Lenin, is the first
major exhibition of Warhol's work since 1988. Admission is $8, $7
for students and ages 60 and up, and $5 for ages 5 to 18.
 &HT;    On the streets or in the galleries, plastic cups of wine in
hand, people gather in Old City, just northeast of the Liberty
Bell, on First Fridays. This month, an extra Friday, July 28, will
accommodate convention visitors at the sprawling open house. About
40 art galleries, on Second and Third Streets, will open from 5
till 9 p.m. For information, call (215) 625-9200 or (800) 555-5191.
 &HT;    It's not Wrigley Field, but Veterans Stadium does have real
baseball, and it's next to the First Union Center. No matter what
they say about Philadelphia fans, the Vet is a friendly place. The
Phillies are home July 25 to July 30 (Chicago and Los Angeles),
Aug. 7 to Aug. 16 (San Diego, Houston and Arizona) and Aug. 25 to
Aug. 30 (San Francisco and Colorado). Tickets, $7 to $22.50;
information, (215) 463-1000.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    In a city that never runs out of material, the Foundation for
Architecture leads walking tours of about two hours five days a
week _ Saturday and Sunday at 2 p.m., and Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday evenings at 6.
 &HT;    A dozen offerings during the convention include ``20th Century
Unlimited,'' around Center Square, and ``Littlest Streets,'' along
the old, once-bohemian residential alleys of Washington Square
West. Adults $7, students $6; (215) 569-3187.
 &HT;    A different thread of history is on view at the hulking Eastern
State Penitentiary, 22nd Street and Fairmount Avenue. Eastern
State, one of the nation's first penitentiaries, opened in 1829 and
was home to Al Capone and Willie Sutton. The gothic stone monster
was only recently rescued from decades of decay and opened for
tours of Capone's specially furnished cell and other exhibits on
Wednesdays through Sundays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. in summer. The
fee is $7, $5 for students and ages 55 and up, and $3 for under 17.
Information, (215) 236-3300.
 &HT;    Walkers naturally seek out Society Hill, the core of
Philadelphia's original civic life and of its downtown revival 30
years ago. It's a genteel quarter, red brick from the sidewalks up,
encompassing Independence National Historic Park and dotted with
courtyards and churchyards, with many Georgian and Federal
buildings. But at its southern edge, South Street booms at night
with bars and quirky shops.
 &HT;    Across Society Hill's northern boundary, Market Street, is Old
City, which 20 years ago was a disused quarter of small, abandoned
garment factories with a few luncheonettes and a string of
restaurant-supply stores. The area is now packed with galleries,
coffeehouses, restaurants and clubs.
 &HT;    Runners can always put on shorts and head up the Benjamin
Franklin Parkway from Center City to the Philadelphia Museum of
Art. A jogging and bike path continues another four miles along the
Schuylkill, where the sights _ bridges, scullers, masses of willows
_ are pretty much as Thomas Eakins painted them more than 100 years
ago.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Philadelphia is booked for convention week, but the building
binge has ensured a tourists' market for most other weeks of the
summer and fall. To find out about hotel packages, including
tickets to cultural events, call a visitors' information number:
(888) 467-4452.
 &HT;    The Sheraton Society Hill, Second and Walnut Streets, has a
quiet, established niche in the historic district. Like its
surroundings, the low-rise red-brick hotel is Colonial (except for
the swimming pool) and sedate. The 365 traditional rooms and suites
range from $155 to $270 for a double. Reservations, (215) 238-6000,
fax (215) 238-6652.
 &HT;    A block from the convention center, Loews, 1200 Market St.,
(215) 627-1200, fax (215) 231-7305, is an Art Deco creation in an
old bank building (check out the vault doors). The 583 rooms are
pure 1930s luxe. A standard double is $175 to $240.
 &HT;    Just off Rittenhouse Square, the Sofitel, a part of the French
hotel chain, recently opened at 120 South 17th St., on a pleasingly
unreconstructed block of tiny shops. The hotel, by contrast, is all
modern and smooth, its 306 rooms furnished in gleaming woods and
geometric prints. Doubles, $189; (215) 569-8300, fax (215)
569-1492.
 &HT;    Budget: The Hawthorn Suites, 1100 Vine St., (215) 829-8300, fax
(215) 829-8104, is crisp and new, if a bit spare. Each of the 294
suites, at $149 to $159 (sometimes less on weekends), has
refrigerator, microwave and wet bar, making life easier for
families. At the northern edge of Center City, the hotel towers
over the convention center and Chinatown.
 &HT;    Luxury: The Park Hyatt Philadelphia at the Bellevue, Broad and
Walnut Streets, is rich in detail and history, a match for the
Academy of Music on the next corner of the theater district. With
just 172 rooms, including suites, it has a ballroom, a
conservatory, a rooftop rose garden and such amenities as a day
spa. Doubles start at $275; (215) 893-1234, fax (215) 732-8518.
 &HT;    Rittenhouse Bed and Breakfast, 1715 Rittenhouse Square, (215)
545-1755, fax (215) 545-1750, is as elegant as the neighboring
square, formal from its facade to its nightly shoeshine service.
Some of the 10 individually decorated rooms, all with baths, have
fireplaces and whirlpools. Rates are $220 to $340 and include full
breakfast.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    An anchor of Center City's restaurant row, Susanna Foo, 1512
Walnut St., (215) 545-2666, has done Asian fusion elegantly for
years. Under silk lanterns, diners can make their way from Chinese
soups and delicate dumplings to emphatically French desserts
(apricot tart with almond ice cream, for one). Dinner for two
people with wine, about $125.
 &HT;    Fishmarket, 122 South 18th St., (215) 569-9080, offers seafood
in a town house with just enough painted wood to feel like a crab
house. In fact, for the summer, the Fishmarket is making a big
production of crabs. Take a stool at the glistening raw bar at
happy hour and enjoy oysters for $1 each. Dinner for two, with a
bottle of wine, about $120. Closed Sunday.
 &HT;    Le Bar Lyonnais, 1523 Walnut St., (215) 567-1000, is the
downstairs wing of Le Bec-Fin, the French restaurant that has been
on national best-of lists for years. The bar offers many lighter
Bec-Fin standards like the galette de crabe and vichyssoise au
caviar at considerably lower prices. The atmosphere is rich, dark
and close -- it seats about 30. No reservations. Dinner for two
with drinks, about $100. Closed Sunday.
 &HT;    On the other side of Rittenhouse Square, Audrey Claire, (215)
731-1222, opens its wide windows at the corner of 20th and Spruce
Streets to a neighborhood of brownstones and small shops. The fare
is Mediterranean _ Audrey Claire is known for its grilled
flatbreads _ and simple. Outdoor tables available. No reservations
on Friday and Saturday. Bring your own wine. Dinner for two, about
$60. Closed Monday.
 &HT;    Effie's, at 1127 Pine St. on Antique Row, (215) 592-8333, is a
tiny Greek restaurant in a row house with a tiny, inviting garden.
Effie's has fresh fish every day, usually served whole, brushed
with lemon and olive oil and grilled. Bring your own wine. Dinner
for two, under $40.
 &HT;    For those who cannot leave town without a cheesesteak, the pure
South Philadelphia version is available at Pat's King of Steaks,
(215) 468-1546, or Geno's, (215) 389-0659, competing cholesterol
palaces at the intersection of Passyunk, South Ninth and Wharton
Streets.
 &HT;    And for South Philly pizza, try Marra's, 1734 East Passyunk
Ave., (215) 463-9249, now in its third generation. Wear a tank top
and bring $5 to $10 a person (that includes the beer).
 &HT;    A note about Pennsylvania dining: Most restaurants have liquor
licenses, but if you must bring your own, plan. Wine and liquor are
sold only in state stores, which are sparse, poorly stocked and
expensive. They are also not open late or on Sunday.

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY MARY-LOU WEISMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    My husband, Larry, and I like to go house hunting on vacation.
One minute we are behaving like proper tourists in Provence, Sydney
or Prague, and the next we're making plans to live there. It's not
enough to be seeing the sites, enjoying the culture, eating the
food and drinking the wine; we have to own the place.
 &HT;    We travel the way Caesar's army conquered Gaul; we come, we see,
we acquire real estate _ at least in our dreams.
 &HT;    When in Rome, Larry imagines himself sitting all day outside his
apartment in the Piazza Navona. He is sipping cappuccino, reading a
book on architecture and smoking. (Larry resumes smoking on all of
his fantasy vacations.)
 &HT;    Larry does not have a job in Rome. I don't either, unless diving
for coins in the Trevi Fountain counts. In order to keep our
fantasy aloft, we have learned to avoid the little pinpricks of
reality such as how we're going to make a living, what we'll do for
friends, where to redeem our empty soda cans or what to do with our
children.
 &HT;    Not every vacation destination is good fantasy material. It may
be a nice place to visit, but even inveterate dreamers wouldn't
want to live there. Some places are too hot; some too cold. I'd be
cutting sod in Ireland right now if it weren't for the bloody rain.
 &HT;    We don't have many third-world real-estate fantasies. I hate to
think we could be so shallow, but it may be that our ability to
have a good fantasy is linked to the life expectancy and gross
national product of the country involved.
 &HT;    We once went on a ``trek'' in the Himalayas. I passed scores of
women who were also trekking, but they were doing it all day every
day, up and down the mountain carrying plastic buckets of water on
their heads.
 &HT;    The Nepalese fantasy outlook was a little more promising for
Larry. The men spent their days sitting cross-legged, playing
cards, smoking and growing stubble. Sure, I yearned to breathe that
pure mountain air on a permanent basis, and to see day break
gloriously each morning over Mount Everest _ but not with a bucket
on my head.
 &HT;    Paris is our favorite place in which to pretend to live. We've
almost bought real estate there several times. We don't care if the
French aren't friendly. When we are French, we won't be friendly
either.
 &HT;    I love to imagine who I'd be if I were French. I walk the
streets, giving the women the once-over, especially the femmes d'un
certain age, my age, middle age, to be precise.
 &HT;    Would I dare to slip into the skin of that flamboyantly hennaed
woman carrying the baguette, the one with the cheekbones, the
purple frock and the green kid heels that do not hurt her feet?
 &HT;    I imagine her on her way to the open-air market where she will
buy an armload of flowers and, on a whim, a canary in a cage. (I
don't like birds and have never wished to own one, but in Paris I
will.)
 &HT;    Larry the lawyer thinks he's that insouciant guy over there,
leaning against the archway rolling a Gauloise around between his
lips, letting the ash fall. Larry's fantasy involves frequent
visits to the Louvre, reading in the Tuileries, eating sweetbreads
and, in the summers, sailing off the coast of Normandy. (Larry
doesn't sail and we have lived for 30 years on Long Island Sound.)
 &HT;    After a few days of imagining ourselves French, we find we are
speaking French. That is to say, we are speaking our very own
spontaneous patois _ using French words when we can remember them,
and when we can't, speaking English with a French accent, like
Charles Boyer. But of course.
 &HT;    We eat a lot of sandwichs jambon. We return to the same cafe at
dusk. We discuss which of our favorite reds should be our house
wine. Thus Frenchified, we feel that the time is right to find our
fantasy home.
 &HT;    Invariably, on one of our many delightfully aimless walks, we
find ourselves in front of a real-estate office. We examine the
photographs on display in the window. Do we want a house or an
apartment? Should we louer or acheter? The Left Bank, of course,
but quelle arrondissement?
 &HT;    Larry, whose favorite opera is ``La Boheme,'' would like
something in the way of a garret, with a dormer window and chimney
pots. And a sink in the corner. I'm not fussy, as long as there's a
place for my canary.
 &HT;    But can we afford it? Larry converts the various asking prices
from francs into dollars. These conversions are followed by a
pause, which is long and weighty enough to indicate that we are
giving sober consideration to the matter.
 &HT;    Then he speaks the words that let me know we've got a
full-fledged fantasy on our hands: ``I wonder how much we could get
for our house?'' We've got lift-off.
 &HT;    It is embarrassing to think about the trail of aborted rental
and purchase agreements we have left in our wake. In St.-Remy it
was ``Small house in town with irises and cyprus trees''; in
Katmandu ``Renovated monastery cell''; in Jackson Hole ``Log cabin,
Teton backdrop''; in the Cotswolds ``One-bedroom cottage,
thatched.''
 &HT;    How easily we betray our real lives in our dreams! How heedless
of the time and energy we put into home, community and friends,
never mind love of country. Vacation fantasizing is a lot like a
midlife crisis. You want to dump your old life and marry some place
new.
 &HT;    We are not the innocent, faithful children we once were. We
don't call out a fond, ``Goodbye house, goodbye door, goodbye
steps, goodbye lawn'' as we back down the driveway. Instead, it's
``Lemme outa here'' as we make our escape, pursued by a swarm of
stress: Did I change the message on the answering machine? Do I
have my passport? Did I hold the mail, pay the bills, call off the
newspaper, program the VCR, turn down the thermostat, straighten my
sock drawer, review my will, forget the tickets, remember the
Xanax? Who wouldn't want to live somewhere else?
 &HT;    Most of the time we're pretty good at keeping fantasy in its
place. Of course we're not going to live in a garret in Paris.
We're just playing house. We've learned our lesson the hard way.
Whenever we have tried to mix fantasy with reality, the gods have
exacted their price. It can be paid in either cash or humiliation.
 &HT;    After a particularly pleasant vacation in London a few years
ago, we resisted the temptation to buy a flat and settled for
buying a London cab. At the time, cabs that had been retired from
service were sold at a garage near Elephant and Castle. Ours had
over 300,000 miles on it. It had a running board. It was full of
quaint advertisements. The seat flipped down. The meter worked. We
 &HT;    imagined what fun we'd have picking up our friends for dinner
and the movies.
 &HT;    Once home, we waited eagerly for the word from Hoboken that our
taxi had arrived. When Larry claimed it at the dock, he and three
guys with tattoos had to push it to get it started. Then the wheels
fell off. The customs inspector felt so sorry for Larry he refused
to charge him any duty.
 &HT;    On yet another occasion we trespassed the threshold between
fantasy and reality big time. It was the '70s, and we were young
and idealistic. We moved from Connecticut to Big Sur, Calif., on
the strength of a two-week stay at the Esalen Institute, where I
was convinced that I could actualize my human potential by pounding
on a pillow and hugging strangers.
 &HT;    It's not as if our friends didn't try to warn us. One of them
did his best to stop us, but we stubbornly refused to get the
point.
 &HT;    ``Haven't you ever had a fantasy about living a better life in
another place?'' I challenged him.
 &HT;    ``Of course I have. I even have a favorite fantasy. I want to
move to London and hire out as a butler in a well-appointed home.''
 &HT;    ``Well then why don't you do it?'' I said.
 &HT;    ``Because then I wouldn't have it as a fantasy any more.''
 &HT;    For an entire year I was a California mountain woman. I
earnestly eschewed brassieres in favor of black leotards. I wore
long paisley skirts that could double as tablecloths, tied at the
waist. I grew all my hair. I made my own granola. I said ``far
out.'' But no matter what I did or how hard I pounded, I was still
from the Northeast.
 &HT;    Larry, who is better than I am at making the best of a bad deal,
smoked a lot and volunteered as a model for the massage class. When
we finally got home and slipped back into reality we vowed we'd
never, ever again lose our grip on fantasy.

THE MATURE TRAVELER: BE A TRAVEL GROUP LEADER

 (Color slide included.) 
 By ADELE MALOTT 
 Condensed from The Mature Traveler Newsletter 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Many travel companies now offer their budget-conscious and
entrepreneurial customers a way to save money on their trips _
sometimes as much as the full price of an airline ticket or the
entire cost of a tour.
 &HT;    The secret? Become a group travel leader. As the name implies,
group travel leaders earn their savings by recruiting friends,
neighbors or people they know from church groups or service clubs
to travel together.
 &HT;    Some mature travelers are so adept at organizing groups that it
becomes something of a part-time business in which they develop
various travel clubs and produce newsletters.
 &HT;    Robert Rogers of Eureka Springs, Ark., started out hoping to
earn travel credits as a ``vacation ambassador'' for Grand Circle
Travel, (800) 597-2452. GCT ambassadors earn a $100 credit for each
of the first four travelers he or she recruits in a calendar year.
Starting with the fifth traveler, credits accumulate at a rate of
$150 per person. The credits can be cashed in for any future trip
offered by GCT.
 &HT;    Rogers' first encounter with Grand Circle occurred two years ago
when he took an all-inclusive trip to the Costa Del Sol. Rogers was
so impressed with the itinerary on that particular tour that he
recommended it to some of his friends, describing it as a ``totally
relaxing'' experience. His anecdotes about the days he spent on the
Mediterranean coast were enough to convince his friends to sign up.
He then made bookings for them.
 &HT;    Rogers was so successful with his inaugural referrals that when
the list grew to 12 friends, GCT designated him a group leader _ a
notch up from vacation ambassador _ earning him a complimentary
trip.
 &HT;    Like Rogers, Bob Jones of Coldchester, Conn., was able to
stretch his travel dollar by also becoming a group leader. After
retiring in 1994 from his job as branch manager of the American
Automobile Association, Jones refused to slow down. ``I am just too
active to do nothing,'' he said. That's when he began asking
friends if they wanted to start a travel club.
 &HT;    After about 75 percent of those he asked said, ``Yes,'' Jones
started organizing cruises for a local travel agency. It wasn't
long before he branched out, coordinating groups for GCT. His first
trip for GCT was to Mexico's Copper Canyon.
 &HT;    
 THE MORE, THE MERRIER  
 &HT;    The larger groups help pay Jones' travel expenses and provide a
way for him to include extras, such as renting a motor coach for
the group to ride together to the New York airport.
 &HT;    ``But once we were in New York, I didn't have to do a thing,''
he says. ``We had our own coach and guide. He handled every
detail.''
 &HT;    Jones says that organizing a travel group can incur some costs,
depending on the amount of energy one wishes to invest in
recruiting participants. For example, Jones opted to personally
mail out brochures. He also took care of receiving each traveler's
deposit and forwarding it to GCT. But, he says, ``After that, Grand
Circle took over ... I didn't even have to count the luggage or the
people _ not once.''
 &HT;    As Jones points out, ``Anyone who is outgoing should be able to
do this.'' He has even gone so far as to hold social gatherings at
his home, where he shows a travel film describing an upcoming
destination and serves coffee and snacks. ``Then it all seems to
happen by itself,'' he says.
 &HT;    Jones has also been a group leader with other travel companies,
including Brendan Tours, Holland America and TWA.
 &HT;    Marion Lothian of Lakehurst, N.J., thinks it's her attention to
detail that makes her trips extra special. In fact, she admits that
her desire for everything to ``be just right'' is the main reason
why she chooses to serve as the intermediary for each participant.
That means getting each deposit, collecting the rest of the
payment, organizing a bus to the airport and allocating tips for
baggage handlers and guides.
 &HT;    ``I want to take care of everything so they don't have to stick
their hands in their pockets for anything,'' she says.
 &HT;    Just before each trip, Lothian briefs her travelers so they know
what to wear, how to handle the money in the country they will
visit and what to do with their passports and visas. When the trip
is concluded, Lothian does her book work and IRS paperwork.
 &HT;    Lothian has worked with Vantage Deluxe World Travel, (800)
634-2180; Collette, (888) 344-5578; and GCT. She even developed her
own travel club in her community of 3,500 and serves as club
president. This past spring she organized tours to Scandinavia and
Spain.
 &HT;    
 WITH THE PERKS COMES WORK  
 &HT;    Lothian suggests that anyone who is thinking about becoming a
group travel leader should have a nice personality as well as ``a
strong sense of right and wrong and how to handle situations while
keeping their cool.
 &HT;    ``If they don't want to do the preparation or book work, they
shouldn't get involved because it is work and responsibility,'' she
adds.
 &HT;    Many travel brochures now spell out the details of group-travel
credits or comps. For example, Vantage Deluxe World Travel provides
a free trip, double occupancy, to group leaders for each group of
10 they recruit _ even if the leader doesn't travel with the group.
 &HT;    Immersia Travel, (800) 207-5454, offers a $1,000 savings for a
``group travel planner'' who gathers five travelers for a trip. A
complimentary trip is earned when the planner gathers 10 people.
For groups of 14 or more, the planner gets both a complimentary
trip and a $100-per-person rebate.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Readers are invited to submit questions and comments to Adele
Malott, c/o The New York Times Syndicate, 122 East 42nd St., 14th
Floor, New York, N.Y. 10168. Send Adele a postcard from your trip

   TEXAS-PRIDE (Houston) _ For months now, Vice President Al Gore
and other national Democrats have pounded away at George W. Bush's
record in Texas, reciting a litany of unflattering statistics while
all but equating the state with Outer Mongolia. Not surprisingly,
Texans, a prideful lot, have taken offense. The criticism seems to

   NY-HARLEM-GALLERY (New York) _ In the fall of 1998, Christian
Haye, a New York poet and art critic, opened a gallery of
contemporary art. He called it The Project and presented an
impressive lineup of artists from the Americas, Europe, Africa and
Asia. But if prime location is everything for a start-up venture,
there was a potential handicap. The gallery wasn't situated within
Manhattan's carefully defined downtown art geography. It was in a
former disco on West 126th Street in Harlem. But Haye has turned
being out-of-the-way into a mark of distinction. By Holland Cotter.

   JAMES-DEAN-FILM (Undated) _ For years, film studios have toyed
with projects about James Dean but were locked in a Catch-22:
studios would finance the movie only with a star _ or at least a
name actor. But these actors shied away from playing the 1950s
icon. Now, a film, called ``James Dean: An Invented Life,'' is in

Weinraub.

   PAPERS-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Readers of Andre Aciman's earlier
work will not be surprised by the rapture over the personal past in
his new book of essays, ``False Papers: Essays on Exile and

city of Alexandria, Egypt, where he spent his childhood, and this
new book is a sort of sequel to the earlier one. Reviewed by
Richard Bernstein.

want what they want when they want it, and, well, if they didn't
plan in advance, they're just going to show up and demand it. By

   (UNDATED) _ Deadline after deadline has slipped by since Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
under U.S. President Bill Clinton's benevolent eye, signed their
declaration of peace on the White House lawn in September 1993. But
America's electoral calendar is compelling. Clinton is at the tail
end of his presidency. This, above all else, has dictated the
timing of the crucial summit between Clinton, Arafat and Israel's
current prime minister, Ehud Barak, at Camp David, giving it sudden
now-or-never urgency. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ It is hard to absorb the full reality. So far, the
global AIDS epidemic is thought to have killed 19 million people.
That is almost twice as many as died in the First World War. It has
infected another 34 million. Within the next few years, AIDS will
have killed nearly as many as the Second World War _ mostly on the
African continent. And the epidemic shows no signs of abating. AIDS
in poor countries will not go away so long as their leaders do not
take a lead in fighting against it. And Africa's rulers, with one
or two shining exceptions, have not yet done so. Some have simply
ignored the problem, and available remedies _ to deadly effect. &QL;

president seemed imminent just last year when his troops were
driven out of Kosovo by NATO forces, is in fact tightening and
perpetuating his grip on power. Worse, he has lost none of the
malign ingenuity that has always been his hallmark. He still knows
how to exacerbate crises that might otherwise be settled
peacefully. And despite being indicted for war crimes, he hopes the
West will turn to him, as it has before, as the only person who can
resolve a conflict that he has himself stirred up. This time, the
West must do better. &QL;

   CHICAGO _ One way to test the buoyancy of Nasdaq is to observe

swelling, Americans have been laying out more money than ever for
tucks, lifts, implants, peels, injections and assorted
``augmentations.'' According to the American Society of Plastic
Surgeons (ASPS), the number of cosmetic surgical procedures grew
almost as quickly as the Dow _ from 413,000 in 1992 to over 1
million in 1998. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ ``Most black people don't think alike. Most black
people just vote alike,'' says J.C. Watts, a black Republican
congressman from Oklahoma. Republicans consistently get a mere 10
percent of the black vote, plus or minus 5 percent, according to a
black think-tank in Washington. This is not just bad news for
Governor George W. Bush; it is bad news for America's blacks.
Although their long identification with the Democratic Party has
allowed some black leaders to emerge, it has been, for the most
part, a Faustian bargain. &QL;

space, the Pentagon had given careful warnings that the whole
project was a ``high-risk'' one. In fact, barely a feather flew.
The missile test of July 7 suffered a failure so fundamental that
it did not even figure among the various ``high-risk'' scenarios
the Pentagon had worried about. It was, in short, a bit like
hitting a tethered chicken. &QL;

   MEXICO CITY _ After ruling Mexico since 1929, the Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI), stunned by its historic defeat in the
July 2 presidential election, now faces a daunting, unprecedented
task: it must not only find new leaders, but a new identity and
methods to sustain it in opposition. Its ability _ or failure _ to
reinvent itself will be important to the stability of
President-elect Vicente Fox's Mexico. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ It sounds McCrazy. In an arguably unrivalled example

itself McWellness to change its name. Why would McDonald's bother

   NEW YORK _ Two floor assistants in Home Depot, a hardware

orientation class other than us?'' one asks the other. ``Uh, let me
think. Nope, just you and me.'' They shake their heads, wondering
why they, alone in a group of 15 who joined only eight months
earlier, are still there. Maybe only suckers stick around in jobs
like theirs. These are words and thoughts that strike terror across
America. Today nearly a quarter of working Americans clock in each
day in businesses where the average tenure is less than a year _
often far less. The ``free agent'' movement that is spurring
white-collar workers to shun corporate career paths is trickling
down to blue-collar workers. &QL;

<P>
   Deadline after deadline has slipped by since Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, under
U.S. President Bill Clinton's benevolent eye, signed their
declaration of peace on the White House lawn in September 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But America's electoral calendar is compelling. Clinton is at
the tail end of his presidential authority. This, above all else,
has dictated the timing of the crucial summit between Clinton,
Arafat and Israel's current prime minister, Ehud Barak, at Camp
David, giving it sudden now-or-never urgency.
</P>
<P>
   Now or never also tripped off the tongue in 1978 when President
Jimmy Carter invited Egypt's Anwar Sadat and Israel's Menachem
Begin to the presidential hideaway. But the prospect of an
Israeli-Arab peace was then new and startling: the three leaders
were explorers in an unknown land.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians and Israelis, by contrast, have been tramping
the land for a decade, at the Madrid conference even before the
Oslo peace track revealed itself in 1993. They have surveyed every
inch of the territory.
</P>
<P>
   But since so many of their demands are incompatible, this
knowledge is not necessarily an advantage. Both Barak and Arafat
have to be able to leave Camp David declaring victory, or at least
seeing it in prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Barak needs a deal that enables Israelis to feel secure from
attack, their nation undiminished. Arafat needs a deal that offers
West Bankers and Gazans a respectable-seeming independent state
while not ignoring the concerns of the Palestinian diaspora and the
wider Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
   Neither leader can get away with less, for neither has the
domestic strength of his Camp David predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Begin had the huge advantage of coming from the right. Sadat had
a dictator's powers _ though he, like Israel's Rabin, was later
murdered by his own people for his belief in peace.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has seen his coalition collapse in the face of a deal. It
put him in an awkward position, as he squeakily survived a vote of
no-confidence this week. But he may, in fact, be better off without
his departed partners: they were a mixed, narrow-minded lot,
endlessly squabbling and horse-trading.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli government had reached the point when bargaining
with its own component parts often took precedence over negotiation
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has the personal strength to rise above his domestic
political bazaar. If he can make a fair deal and present it to his
people, including his Palestinian-born people, in a referendum, he
stands a good chance of success.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis have much more on their minds than the boring business
with the Palestinians, and most of them want to see an end to it.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has the opposite problem. Free of Barak's democratic
restraints, he should have little trouble pushing a deal through
his loyalist administration.
</P>
<P>
   His people are another matter. Palestinians outside the
territories have always opposed the Oslo peace track, mainly
because it touches only lightly on their overriding interest: the
right of their return to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Now West Bankers and Gazans, too, are skeptical of a process
that has brought few of them much freedom and has made most of them
much poorer.
</P>
<P>
   A central difficulty is that the Israelis believe that
concessions must start from the current situation, whereas the
Palestinians believe they have already made a vast concession by
accepting an embryo state amounting to little more than one-fifth
of mandated Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, they will have to concede a lot more. But if the end
result fails to win widespread West Bank and Gazan backing, the
initiative could pass to Palestinian rejectionists.
</P>
<P>
   The naysayers, with their violent Islamist elements, will never
be satisfied with anything Arafat can get. The hope is that the
rejectionists can be marginalized in the framework of general
acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   The now-or-never label notwithstanding, the summit could end
inconclusively. The stumble towards peace could then continue. If,
at worst, failure cannot be disguised, the consequences will be
bad.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has promised to declare an independent state by Sept. 13.
He made a similar promise last year, only to retreat under
pressure. A second broken promise is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has threatened, in return, to annex the land on which
Jewish settlements have been built. No doubt, after a while, the
two sides would start talking once again. But it would be a
bloodily violent while.
</P>
<P>
   When things were at their nastiest at Camp David in 1978, with
the Egyptians packing their bags to go home, Carter intervened to
knock heads together. If he is to get a deal, Clinton too may have
to knock on more than wood. &QL;

<P>
   It is hard to absorb the full reality. So far, the global AIDS
epidemic is thought to have killed 19 million people. That is
almost twice as many as died in the First World War. It has
infected another 34 million.
</P>
<P>
   When they die, as most will in the next few years, AIDS will
have killed nearly as many as the Second World War. And the
epidemic shows no signs of abating.
</P>
<P>
   UNAIDS, the umbrella group that coordinates the anti-AIDS effort
of various U.N. agencies, reckons that 5 million people a year are
being infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that
causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   If these people were dying from bullets and bombs, they would
never be out of the headlines. Not for nothing is the slogan of the
international AIDS conference that has just taken place in Durban,
South Africa, ``break the silence.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that drugs can ward off the effects of AIDS in people who
can afford them, the issue has slid out of sight in the rich world.
</P>
<P>
   Seen from that world, AIDS is just another disease, like
malaria, measles and mumps, which westerners can ignore in the
knowledge that they are unlikely to catch it and will not die of it
even if they do.
</P>
<P>
   Yet AIDS is not just another infection, and comparing its
victims with the casualty lists of a war is not mere rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Most diseases pick off young children and the elderly. AIDS hits
those in the prime of life. The human disaster for its victims and
their families thus feeds into a social and economic disaster for
the countries affected.
</P>
<P>
   And, with few exceptions, those countries are in Africa, a
continent that has dire enough economic and social problems
already.
</P>
<P>
   Attitudes are at last starting to change. In January the
American government upgraded the threat of AIDS from one that
merely affects people's health to one that affects the security of
nations.
</P>
<P>
   James Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank, has declared that
there is ``no limit'' to the amount the Bank will spend on AIDS,
and it announced at the start of the conference that $500 million
is now available. And in May, five large drug companies agreed with
UNAIDS not only that something must be done, but that they might
help.
</P>
<P>
   One company, Merck, has put $50 million of its money where its
mouth is. It plans to deliver, with the Gates Foundation, an
American charity, what it claims will be a comprehensive anti-AIDS
package for Botswana, the worst-affected country of all.
</P>
<P>
   Such initiatives are welcome, even if they are a drop in the
ocean (the World Bank estimates that Africa alone may need to spend
$2.3 billion a year on the disease). But it is rarely possible for
outsiders to solve other peoples' problems.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS in poor countries will not go away so long as their leaders
do not give a lead in fighting against it. And Africa's rulers,
with one or two shining exceptions, have not yet done so. Some have
simply ignored the problem. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 525) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, South Africa, the conference's host, is a shining bad
example. It makes angry noises at drug firms, while failing to
promote the use of medicines such as AZT and nevirapine that are
known to be effective at preventing the transmission of HIV from
mother to child at birth.
</P>
<P>
   Thabo Mbeki, the country's president, who has been listening to
a small band of scientists with eccentric and discredited opinions,
has allowed doubts to linger over whether AIDS is actually caused
by HIV in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Africa has some special features. Africans are beset
by many diseases, each of which serves to weaken people and to make
them susceptible to the others. And poverty aggravates the problem,
as do incessant wars. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,125) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   If Africa were as rich and peaceful as Europe or America, AIDS
might by now be as rare there as elsewhere. But it is not,
ultimately, a lack of money that causes AIDS. It is a virus.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping, or slowing, that virus is not impossible, as the
example of Uganda, which has reduced its level of infection from 14
percent to 8 percent over the past decade, shows.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few simple but important steps that need to be
taken. The first is to stop being squeamish about sex. AIDS is
mainly a sexually-transmitted disease. That means that people enjoy
giving it to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about sex is taboo in many African cultures. But in
places like Uganda, the taboo has been overcome. All successful
prevention campaigns have worked by preaching ways, notably the use
of condoms, that reduce the enjoyment of sex only slightly.
Campaigns that have merely preached abstinence have always failed.
</P>
<P>
   The second idea is to test pregnant women for HIV, and give them
AZT or nevirapine if they turn out to be infected. This is a rather
cheap and effective use of anti-AIDS drugs, which ought to be near
the top of even the poorest country's health budget.
</P>
<P>
   Health systems also must be better run so that the drugs are
properly administered and followed up, to minimize the risk of the
virus developing resistance. These steps, alone, could save 500,000
infant lives a year.
</P>
<P>
   The other way to help stop the spread of AIDS is to empower
women so that they can say no. This is terribly difficult in the
many patriarchal _ i.e., exploitative _ African cultures. Yet women
who are educated have a much better chance of saying no than women
who are not.
</P>
<P>
   The no does not have to be no to all sex. But it does need to be
no to unprotected sex with anybody about whose HIV status a woman
is unsure.
</P>
<P>
   Men too would benefit from better education in the dangers and
risks attached to AIDS, but education of girls is less often
attempted and yet even more important, because they are more likely
to act to slow the spread of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   So this must be a third plank of an effective anti-AIDS
strategy: Condoms. Healthy births. And educated women. These will
not abolish AIDS. That, if it ever happens, will require effective
vaccines, and those are years away. They might, however, contain it
and stop the deaths of many of the young, vigorous people whom poor
countries need.
</P>
<P>
   Africans, and indeed all people in poor countries where the
disease has a grip, should be shouting out about these things. It
is that shout that needs to break the silence. No amount of
cheering from the sidelines by the West will do instead. &QL;

<P>
   For anyone who hopes that European history is coasting towards a
happy, democratic ending, the latest news from the Balkans must
come as a shock.
</P>
<P>
   Slobodan Milosevic, whose downfall as Yugoslav president seemed
imminent last year when his troops were driven out of Kosovo, is
tightening and perpetuating his grip on power. Worse, he has lost
none of the malign ingenuity that has always been his hallmark.
</P>
<P>
   He still knows how to exacerbate crises that might otherwise be
settled peacefully. And despite being indicted for war crimes, he
hopes the West will turn to him, as it has before, as the only
person who can resolve a conflict that he has himself stirred up.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the West must do better.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional changes rushed through the Yugoslav
legislature this month are a textbook example of the Milosevic
method. The amendments were designed to make life intolerable for
Montenegro, Serbia's reluctant partner in the Yugoslav federation.
</P>
<P>
   The aim was to reduce Montenegro's say in federal affairs and
thus to bounce Milo Djukanovic, the Montenegrin leader, into a
referendum on independence _ which might in turn trigger a civil
war in which Serbia could ``intervene'' without seeming to fire
first.
</P>
<P>
   For people whose purpose is served by fratricide, Montenegro
provides uniquely promising material. Like Northern Ireland, it is
a small, clannish territory whose well-armed populace is deeply,
and about evenly, divided over questions of political and cultural
identity _ which anyway have no clear-cut or rational answer.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of Montenegrins firmly support independence; a
third want no loosening of the ties with Serbia; the remainder are
in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   If at some time in the future, a clear majority of Montenegrins
were to vote for independence, and the republic came under attack
from Serbia, NATO would have little choice but to rally to the
smaller republic's aid. That is a political reality of which
Milosevic should be reminded as clearly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   It would, however, be vastly preferable if the slide towards
confrontation could be halted at an earlier stage. Given the
reluctance of western governments to face the messiness of ground
warfare in mountainous terrain, military aid to Montenegro would
presumably take the form of air support.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever such a policy achieved, it would not be able _ on past
evidence _ to prevent retaliatory killings on a horrific scale in
Montenegro's highlands, and it might well exacerbate them.
</P>
<P>
   In some circumstances, a storming NATO intervention would seem
less bad than doing nothing; but everything possible should be done
to stop such circumstances arising.
</P>
<P>
   How can the risk be reduced? Hitherto, western policy has aimed,
sensibly enough, at calming the political atmosphere through modest
economic aid and quiet security help for Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Though it has cushioned the effects of Serbia's blockade, this
aid has not so far been effective enough to convince a clear
majority of Montenegrins that their interests are served by
pro-western policies.
</P>
<P>
   With the Djukanovic government keeping a tight hold on the
economy, some citizens suspect their leader of using the standoff
with Serbia for his own political purposes _ and they blame the
West for abetting him.
</P>
<P>
   A worse problem is that in Serbia, too, people doubt whether the
West really would help them economically if they ousted Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of concentrating on fanfare diplomacy, like the Balkan
summit France wants to convene, West European governments should be
looking for ways to show their good faith to skeptics in both
Serbia and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   They should swiftly act, as the European Commission suggests, to
open their markets to exports from Montenegro and other south
Balkan countries. And the EU's leaders should endorse, loudly and
clearly, the commission's proposal to set aside a substantial sum
for the reconstruction of a post-Milosevic Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic, meanwhile, should be urged to open up his economy to
the sort of legal, private-sector activity that gives people a
stake in peace.
</P>
<P>
   He should also be told to deal generously with his compatriots
who feel culturally Serbian, embarrassed though some may be by
Serbia's government. If he matches Milosevic's cunning, he might
yet turn this crisis into an opportunity to ease Montenegro's
internal wounds. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ For most of this campaign, Vice President Al Gore
has been suffering from multiple personality disorder.
</P>
<P>
   He can be an alpha male, a caring environmentalist or an
international statesman, depending on the time of day. Trying to
raise doubts about whether he knows who he is, wired Republicans
have taken to calling his latest pronouncements ``Gore 7.0.''
</P>
<P>
   They ask when the real Al Gore will please stand up. And the
answer may be: now.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past week, a new model candidate has been road-tested.
With this version, Gore may at last have settled on something he
can take to the voters in November. It may even work.
</P>
<P>
   Here is Gore in Chicago: ``I'm on your side and I want to fight
for the people. The other side fights for the powerful. That's why
the big pharmaceutical companies are supporting Governor Bush.
That's why the big oil companies are supporting Governor Bush.
That's why the big polluters are supporting Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Or this, from Connecticut: ``I've stood up to the big drug
companies, the big oil companies, the insurance companies and the
HMOs.''
</P>
<P>
   Or this, from Lexington, Ky.: ``On behalf of those people _ not
just the ones who think comfortably about their savings over scotch
in the club looking out at the golf links, but also the ones...on
the factory floor _ we will take the White House in November.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's Al Gore, class warrior.
</P>
<P>
   Abusing the rich is hardly unprecedented in America. Teddy
Roosevelt made a career of it. But it is unusual. And, at the
moment, it looks uncommonly risky.
</P>
<P>
   Americans tend to aspire upwards and disdain down. At a time
when 87 percent of voters say they admire people who get rich by
working hard and when the new economy is producing millions of
footloose voters who are pro-business and could not care less about
traditional party ideology, Gore's populist rhetoric makes him
sound like one of those generals busy fighting the last war.
</P>
<P>
   He risks irrelevance. He also risks losing the money he needs to
prosecute his campaign _ which, sadly, has to come from those same
villains of corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   But the vice president is a peculiar sort of class warrior. In
the past, populists have usually combined their attacks on the rich
with proposals to upset the status quo by, for example, taking the
railways into public ownership, or by increasing income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is not like this. To say he supports the economic status
quo does not do justice to his conservatism. Prudence is his
watchword. It is, he keeps telling people, the reason why the
economy has been such a success and why it cannot be entrusted to
the dangerous Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Though the vice president has become more bountiful with his
spending plans of late (in response to the rising budget surplus),
in general his economic policy is every bit as cautious as his
rhetoric is extravagant.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, on the same day Gore was denouncing oil and drug
companies in Chicago, the Democratic Party in Washington was
issuing its draft platform, or manifesto.
</P>
<P>
   It is a Clintonian document: fiscally disciplined, cautious,
trade-opening, technology-promoting and business-friendly _ i.e.,
everything populists are not. The New Democrats, the centrists of
the party to which Gore belongs, loved it.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's split personality is hardly unique. Most
politicians are torn between populism, to please the party
diehards, and moderation, to attract the wavering middle.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's ``compassionate conservatism,'' for example, attempts to
reconcile supporters on the right and in the center. If the Texan's
alliteration-loving publicists worked for the Democrats, Gore's new
program would no doubt be dubbed ``progressive pragmatism.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 625) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Yet the vice-president's political schizophrenia seems to run
deeper than normal.
</P>
<P>
   It shows up, for example, in his environmental record, where the
deep-green radicalism of his book, ``Earth in the Balance,''
contrasts with his more pragmatic record in office. It consorts
with his campaigning style and beliefs in almost every election he
has fought _ the first abrasive, the second cautious.
</P>
<P>
   A split personality would make Gore a poor president (assuming,
that is, that it affected his behavior in an office where
consistency is essential). But it does not necessarily make him a
poor candidate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   So far, his targets (oil and drug companies and HMOs) have been
so unpopular that not even Bush has stood up to defend them. As
long as Gore's class-based rhetoric does not become so strident
that it puts off more people than it attracts, then it has several
advantages.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's sallies against big business help shore up his left wing
against the challenge of Ralph Nader and the Green Party.
</P>
<P>
   Unions have been less than enthusiastic about the vice president
because of his support for trade with China. By portraying himself
as a fighter for the common man against big business, Gore might
reconcile some of them to his candidacy again _ and get out the
blue-collar vote.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Gore's populism is a nice way of negating Bush's claim to
be a ``new kind of Republican.'' It does this directly, by painting
him as a traditional big-business Republican who cares about fat
cats rather than the public.
</P>
<P>
   It also does so indirectly, by narrowing the gap Bush has tried
to create between himself and the congressional Republicans, who
are far less popular than he is. Gore combines his anti-business
broadsides with side-thrusts at the ``do-nothing-for-the-people
Republican Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, Gore's combination of populist rhetoric and centrist
policies presents him with a way around that occupational hazard
facing all vice presidents: how to distinguish yourself from your
predecessor, without losing the credit for his achievements, or
seeming disloyal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 50 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,000) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The anti-corporate ranting is certainly different from Bill
Clinton, who rarely indulges in such old-fashioned attacks. It also
provides one or two new, popular promises (to reduce the cost of
drugs and fuel). And it does so without seriously compromising
Gore's claim to fiscal rectitude. &QL;

prove hard to prevent Gore's class-based rhetoric overwhelming his
policy restraint. But, though he is venturing down a risky road,
inconsistency is already making him a better candidate. &QL;

   As technical failures go, this one could hardly have been more
humiliating. Before conducting the third test of its ``mini-Star
Wars'' system intended to smash up enemy warheads in space, the
Pentagon had given careful warnings that the whole project was a
``high-risk'' one.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics, meanwhile, had questioned the honesty of the test,
arguing that it was far too easy.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast with a real-life onslaught by a rogue state, the
designers of the intercepting missile would know the time and
source of the incoming missile; they would also know all about the
single, crude decoy that would be released at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   It was, in short, a bit like hitting a tethered chicken.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, barely a feather flew. The missile test on July 7
suffered a failure so fundamental that it did not even figure among
the various ``high-risk'' scenarios the Pentagon had worried about.
</P>
<P>
   The intercepting missile refused to separate from its booster
rocket, so no collision was attempted; and in a separate setback,
the decoy balloon did not inflate.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO) is
still at an early stage in its program of 19 tests. But the
experiment was a politically sensitive one on both sides of the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton has said its outcome will help him to
decide whether to launch an anti-missile program before his
presidency ends. If he does so, that would have momentous
diplomatic consequences. In particular it might mean breaking out
of the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, which the Russians and
Chinese hold dear.
</P>
<P>
   From this perspective, you might have imagined that the failure
would be greeted with relief by the Clinton administration. In
fact, the test weakens its diplomatic leverage with the Russians _
and reduces the chances that they will accept America's proposed
amendments to the ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Clinton and, particularly, Al Gore will remain exposed to
Republican allegations that the administration has not pursued
anti-missile defenses with sufficient zeal.
</P>
<P>
   Military analysts are asking questions not just about the
competence of the BMDO and its contractors, but about the concept
itself. Richard Garwin, a missile-defense expert, thinks the test
adds weight to the view that the missiles should be intercepted
soon after they are launched, not in space.
</P>
<P>
   You don't want the chicken to get too far off the ground. &QL;

   CHICAGO _ One way to test the buoyancy of Nasdaq is to observe
the blouses and trousers of America. With their investment accounts
swelling, Americans have been laying out more money than ever for
tucks, lifts, implants, peels, injections and assorted
``augmentations.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS),
the number of cosmetic surgical procedures grew almost as quickly
as the Dow _ from 413,000 in 1992 to over 1 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Procedures are within the grasp of everyday folks,'' says Dr.
Lin Puckett, a practitioner who is also the ASPS's president.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, given the complaints about the bubble economy, the
most common body upgrade is liposuction, a surgical procedure in
which fat is suctioned from beneath the skin with a vacuum machine.
Doctors performed over 170,000 liposuction procedures in 1998, more
than three times as many as in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger breasts are also in demand now that safer saline implants
have replaced silicone. The number of breast-augmentation surgeries
increased 306 percent between 1992 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   After these, the most common procedures are eyelid surgery (up
102 percent over the same period), facelifts (up 77 percent), and
chemical peels (up 246 percent).
</P>
<P>
   No part of the body is beyond improvement. There are buttock
lifts, chin augmentations, anti-wrinkle injections and even cheek
implants.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are women the only ones seeking technological assistance.
Men account for roughly 10 percent of all cosmetic procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Such vanity is not risk-free. The husband of a prominent Chicago
socialite died earlier this year after cosmetic facial surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration has just approved saline breast
implants for continued use, but it notes that the devices have a
high failure rate; roughly one in six women require a second
surgical procedure within three years of receiving the implants.
</P>
<P>
   Such surgery is not covered by health insurance. The average
breast augmentation costs over $3,000; a buttock lift is slightly
more. Liposuction fees average $1,900 per ``site.''
</P>
<P>
   The work is lucrative for doctors; since patients pay up front,
there is no haggling with HMOs over paperwork or reimbursement
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic surgeons have traditionally done America's
body-sculpting, but dermatologists, ophthalmologists and other
doctors are expanding their cosmetic offerings and advertising
aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet teems with proselytizers for neat buns, boobs and
chins. People are bombarded by radio advertisements that begin, ``I
used to be self-conscious about my appearance...''
</P>
<P>
   The until-recently booming stock market is not the only reason
for all this nipping and tucking. Another factor is the demographic
bulge. The baby-boomers are reaching the age where assorted body
parts are feeling (and worse, showing) the effects of time and
gravity.
</P>
<P>
   One of the largest segments of the market is ``facial
rejuvenation.'' The typical patient, says Dr. Puckett, is from
``married middle-class America.''
</P>
<P>
   The urge to flirt with eternal youth for such folk is strong.
But can it survive another plunge in the Nasdaq? &QL;

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ ``Would you mind opening the boot (trunk)?'' The
guards at the vehicle entrance to the massive, ugly complex of
offices that are the headquarters of the Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI) were never especially security-conscious.
But after the party's historic defeat at the hands of Vicente Fox
in the presidential election on July 2, they have become so.
</P>
<P>
   Not because they worry about what visitors may bring into the
PRI's offices. Rather, they are making sure that nobody takes
anything away. The risk of staff sneaking off with office
equipment, however, is the most trivial of the PRI's problems.
</P>
<P>
   After ruling Mexico since 1929, the party faces an unprecedented
task: it must not only find new leaders, but a new identity and
methods to sustain it in opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Since the PRI will retain a big presence in Congress and state
government, its ability _ or failure _ to reinvent itself will be
important to the stability of Fox's Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The new president will not be sworn in until Dec. 1. But already
the battle over the PRI's future has broken out.
</P>
<P>
   The party's disconcerted state was summed up last week when
Dulce Maria Sauri, the PRI's chairwoman, and other party officials
offered to resign, only to backtrack hours later.
</P>
<P>
   For several days, the PRI's traditional facade of public unity
has been punctured by open sniping and squabbling. Many of the
PRI's lower ranks blame their defeat on President Ernesto Zedillo.
Others point the finger at their uninspiring presidential
candidate, Francisco Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the PRI's ills lie deeply in its political genes. Born
as the National Revolutionary Party, it was an attempt to provide
stability by uniting under a single banner hundreds of factions,
interest groups and small political parties thrown up by Mexico's
1910-17 revolution.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, and for many years, it was extraordinarily
successful. Yet its traditional strengths have become weaknesses:
the division between party and state was blurred and the PRI had no
clear ideology save that of power.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did each president impose his own policies on the PRI,
but he acted as the party's supreme arbiter, choosing its top
officials, while balancing and holding together an elaborate web of
interests to ensure the system's perpetuity.
</P>
<P>
   So the first problem the PRI must confront is the vacuum created
by its loss of the presidency. But that is likely to overlap with
the policy battle.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo and his two predecessors each pursued broadly liberal
economic policies which challenged corporatist traditions, and hurt
interest-groups such as labor and farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI's most obvious divide is between the ``technocrats'' who
came to dominate central government, and the traditionalist
``dinosaurs,'' who include many state governors. Labastida is in
fact an intermediate figure between the two groups.
</P>
<P>
   But defeat tars with a broad brush. Labastida and his campaign
team, who included a few ``dinosaurs,'' as well as Zedillo and his
cabinet, are now equally discredited.
</P>
<P>
   And defeat has tarnished Zedillo's ``neo-liberal'' policies too.
These gave Mexico macroeconomic stability and new growth, but
increased the rich-poor gap and landed taxpayers with an expensive
bank bailout.
</P>
<P>
   A more reflective analysis would note that the PRI was defeated
from its right, not its left, and that Fox might turn out to be as
``neo-liberal'' as Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   But the PRI's mood is rebellious. ``Many people are angry with
Zedillo and have stopped obeying him,'' says Ernesto Ramirez, a
young civil servant who has spent 14 years as a PRI activist, and
calls himself a ``babysaur.''
</P>
<P>
   If the dinosaurs are now in a strong position, it is partly
because without the presidency the PRI's most powerful officials
will be its state governors and the bosses of the big pro-PRI trade
unions, such as those of the oil workers, telephone workers,
electricians and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more important, to get all the PRI's factions to
support Labastida's campaign, many old-timers were offered places
on the party's congressional lists.
</P>
<P>
   Though he lost, they did not: the PRI will no longer have an
absolute majority in the Senate, but it will still be the largest
single party in both houses of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   That could make it hard for Fox to cut the deals he will need in
the legislature, if the PRI stays united. Will it? The first test
will come in internal elections, to be held probably in November. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 750, OR CONTINUE TO 1,125) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At a meeting with Zedillo on July 11, the PRI's state governors
agreed that Sauri should stay on as party chairman to prepare these
elections _ but with an advisory committee of the party's former
chairmen to help her.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the rest of the PRI's executive resigned the next day.
</P>
<P>
   A dissident group of seven state governors, led by Roberto
Madrazo from the southeastern state of Tabasco, want a new election
for the PRI's 300-member national council, and not just for the
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo is tipped by some as the PRI's likely new leader. He was
Labastida's main challenger in last year's primary for the PRI's
presidential candidacy, which brought him national prominence and a
campaign network.
</P>
<P>
   Activists such as Ramirez are already being invited to meetings
organized to push his bid for the leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of Madrazo at the helm worries many. Though he is
relatively young and talks of modernizing and democratizing the
party, his record speaks of a return to the old methods: his
election to the governorship in 1994 was so dogged by accusations
of overspending that Zedillo tried, but failed, to make him step
down.
</P>
<P>
   But in October Madrazo's own state elects a new governor. Should
the PRI lose, as it may, his credibility will suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins the PRI leadership will have to try to keep the
party together while working out a new set of policies, and seeking
new sources of funds. Without the patronage of central government,
and the largesse that flowed from it, many supporters may drift
away.
</P>
<P>
   Having relied in the past on the vote in rural areas, the party
has to make a special effort to attract young and middle-class
voters _ not something the dinosaurs are obviously well-placed to
do.
</P>
<P>
   More important than any new ideology, therefore, could be the
party's performance where it still has power.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it can't achieve good government at the municipal and state
level, it doesn't have a future,'' says Javier Trevino, a former
adviser to Labastida. ``That's what the old-timers don't want to
see.'' But that also gives Fox some leverage with which to gain
legislative allies. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Two floor assistants in Home Depot, a hardware
superstore, are chatting. ``Is there anyone left from our
orientation class other than us?'' one asks the other. ``Uh, let me
think. Nope, just you and me.''
</P>
<P>
   They shake their heads, wondering why they, alone in a group of
15 who joined only eight months earlier, are still there. Maybe
only suckers stick around in jobs like theirs.
</P>
<P>
   These are words and thoughts that strike terror across America.
Today nearly a quarter of working Americans clock in each day in
businesses where the average tenure is less than a year _ often far
less, as in the case of one 24-hour warehouse where the average
employee lasted just four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Industries with 100 percent or more average annual turnover
include most of retailing, food services and call centers, along
with more specialized businesses that range from elderly-care
nursing to car sales. Together, they account for more than 30
million workers.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason for all this disloyalty is America's tightest
labor market in a generation. Unemployment, at around 4 percent
nationally and less than 2 percent in many regions, is at a 30-year
low. Walk down any high street or cruise any shopping mall and it
is hard to find a store that is not begging for workers.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more to it than that. Behind the counters and
between the cubicles, the balance of power has shifted: workers
know that they are in demand and that they have more choices than
ever before.
</P>
<P>
   The ``free agent'' movement that is spurring white-collar
workers to shun corporate career paths is trickling down to
blue-collar workers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of job security and guarantees, they want opportunity
and merit pay. And if they do not get it, they do not hesitate to
quit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 300) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Across the board, Americans' average tenure with their current
employer has remained relatively steady at around three years for
most of the past decade, but some industries are doing far worse
than the norm.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, part-time retail workers (the largest category of
employees in that industrial sector, which employs in total more
than 20 million people) had an average turnover rate last year of
124 percent, according to a survey by the National Retail
Federation; turnover of full-time workers was a still-shocking 74
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the Food Marketing Institute estimates that turnover
of full-time grocery-store employees almost doubled between 1991
and 1999. The median tenure of supermarket employees is now 97
days, according to a recent survey by Blake Frank of the University
of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two favorite words in this industry have become `help
wanted,''' Michael Sansolo, a Food Marketing Institute vice
president, told a recent conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's labor market is probably the toughest I've experienced
in my 30 years in this industry,'' says Bill Parker, who runs call
centers for Spherion, based in Florida. &QL;

   As one might expect, what many of these high-turnover jobs have
in common is that they are poorly paid, hard, boring, dead-end,
dangerous or otherwise unattractive.
</P>
<P>
   There are some exceptions, however: despite fast-rising salaries
and liberal use of such retention tools as stock options, employee
defections in the high-tech industry have also reached epidemic
proportion, with the average technology professional now staying on
the job for just 13 months, according to Roy Talman &AMP; Associates, a
Chicago headhunting firm.
</P>
<P>
   The price of this employee churn is extraordinarily high. Most
analysts reckon that the cost of losing an employee, all told, is
between half and one-and-a-half times his annual salary.
</P>
<P>
   Even fast-food joints, which typically think of staff as almost
as disposable as the cutlery, calculate the cost of replacing each
one at more than $500.
</P>
<P>
   For a software engineer, the total cost of a departure, from
lost production time to recruitment and training of the
replacement, can exceed $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   A survey last year by the American Management Association put
turnover at the top of bosses' list of worries, with the majority
saying that their retention concerns were getting more serious each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in these industries is suffering equally. The best
have managed to change the way they run their operations to cut
turnover. Others are striving to find employees who are more likely
to stay.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a few years ago 7-Eleven, a convenience-store
chain, introduced an automated free phone number that allows job
applicants to fill out a form by telephone 24 hours a day. By
modifying the questions asked according to previous answers,
7-Eleven was able to screen out poor candidates more effectively
than if it used paper forms.
</P>
<P>
   Now the company hires nearly half of its new staff from such
telephone applicants, and retention rates have risen. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 125 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 800) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the job-line's success was that it was easy
and convenient. For companies that are open fewer hours of the day
than a convenience chain, this can matter even more.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers often find that allowing people to apply after hours
also brings in people who are already working elsewhere, a far more
desirable group than the unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   Storehouse, a men's clothing chain, goes so far as to issue
special employment-invitation cards to its employees and encourages
them to hand them out to anyone impressive whom they meet working
at another store. The strategy has been so successful that the
chain has kept its stores staffed without running help-wanted ads. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,250) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the tight labor market is forcing firms to be
more flexible in the way they treat the employees they have.
</P>
<P>
   Loosening policies on working hours, for instance, can bring in
stay-at-home mothers who need to work around child care and
illnesses, a potentially valuable work force that is normally
excluded by strict shift regimes.
</P>
<P>
   Better training might seem like an odd response to a tight job
market _ after all, the employee is likely to leave, so why waste
the money? _ but it too can pay dividends, since one of the main
reasons why employees leave is the poor quality of their
co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   And if the business sometimes has to be run shorthanded, the
best way to ensure that customers do not suffer is to make certain
the hands available are helpful ones.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for better advancement opportunities, merit-based
pay and language lessons: all help to build loyalty in a climate
where disloyalty is more commonly rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious incentive _ more money _ is often the last to
be considered. Companies are under intense shareholder pressure to
keep down payroll costs, which have a more immediate and obvious
effect on corporate performance than morale.
</P>
<P>
   Although employees may leave for more money, non-monetary
factors are often more important, says Michael O'Malley, an
employment expert with William Mercer, a management consultancy.
Companies that try to ``buy happiness'' often end up with ``a deal
culture where everything is for sale and everything can be
bargained.''
</P>
<P>
   America's extraordinary lack of wage inflation _ $7 has been the
hourly rate for a supermarket worker for nearly a decade _ is
testament to the pervasiveness of this thinking. But with turnover
pressure still rising, clever management tricks can go only so far.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley, stock options, free frappuccinos and the
chance to change the world are the rewards for loyalty. At Home
Depot it may eventually have to be more cash. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It sounds McCrazy. In an arguably unrivalled example
of corporate paranoia, McDonald's, a giant hamburger chain, has
forced a tiny health-care company based in Switzerland and calling
itself McWellness to change its name.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing, of course, for McDonald's to defend itself
against a shoddy hamburger joint brightening up a greasy shopfront
with a pair of golden arches, or pinching the ``Mc'' prefix to
piggyback on its reputation for consistent standards.
</P>
<P>
   Even here the Oak Brook, Ill.-based multinational has been a
touch ruthless. It has sued a sausage stand in Denmark called
McAllan's, a coffee shop in California run by Elizabeth McCaughey,
and McMunchies, a sandwich shop in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   It is another thing, though, to send packs of lawyers after a
company that offers Internet-based medical services to corporate
executives.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Internet makes it easy for trademark harassers to
flush out offenders. But McWellness's rather silly name had nothing
to do with McDonald's anyway. Its genesis was McKinsey, a
management consultancy where its two founders once worked.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Staehelin, one of them, says she wanted a name, like
McKinsey, that promised global standards, although she admits that
reference to a McDonald's burger ``works just as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The puzzle is why McDonald's would bother with this loss-making
small fry employing only 45 people. In a letter to the American
patent office's trademark trial and appeal board in January,
McDonald's lawyers complained that allowing the use of McWellness
or alternatives like McDoctor or McMedicine ``will create confusion
and will cause damage to its (McDonald's) hard-earned goodwill.''
</P>
<P>
   Would McWellness, which last month gave in and renamed itself
GetWellness at the cost of some $1.8 million, four times its annual
revenue, frighten patients with dark tales of cholesterol in Happy
Meals? Perhaps, though, McDonald's has more ambitious plans.
</P>
<P>
   Clues lurk in the vast array of non-food related trademarks
registered by the company _ McTravel and McSpaceStation among them.
It even claims to own the phrase ``Immunize for Healthy Lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The company admits that its future plans ``are not limited to
food.'' Before it got nasty, McDonald's considered taking a stake
in McWellness.
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, in their letter to the patent office, its lawyers
predict that McDonald's will ``likely expand the use of its `Mc'
formative marks to include the same services on which the
McWellness mark is intended to be used.''
</P>
<P>
   Reconciling burgers with health care might prove a stretch. But
McDonald's seems ready to give it a try. Where there's ``Mc,'' it
doubtless believes, there's brass. &QL;

ITALY'S `GENETICALLY MUTATING' PRISON POPULATION

<P>
   MILAN _ ``The prison population has been genetically mutating,''
says Giancarlo Caselli, the man in charge of keeping Italy's
criminals behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   He is not referring to some scientific experiment under way in
such prisons as Milan's San Vittore or Rome's Regina Coeli, but to
changes in the social and criminal make-up within the country's 257
jails.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, nearly all inmates were Italian, and the range of
their crimes was wide. Today, out of 52,000 inside, 14,000 are
foreigners. One-third are there because of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Caselli is one of many who would like an amnesty; otherwise, he
fears, tensions may snap. It would be the 20th big release since
1947.
</P>
<P>
   Most people who support the current, rather shaky, coalition
government of the center-left broadly favor the idea of a new
amnesty; so does the Catholic church.
</P>
<P>
   When Pope John Paul visited Regina Coeli on July 9, he appealed
_ to the cheers of inmates _ for ``a gesture of clemency.'' A week
before, in the hope of hastening their release, prisoners in
several jails had rioted. Disturbances have been reported in as
many as 52 Italian prisons in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The government has dithered, while making several proposals _
for new prisons, for more magistrates to make the wheels of justice
turn faster, for foreign criminals to be kicked out of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   But ministers are wary of suggesting another amnesty, because
the opinion polls suggest that six out of ten Italians are against
the idea.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition, which is riding high, is not keen to help the
government out. Amnesties must be approved by a majority of
two-thirds in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Still, almost everyone agrees that something must be done. Italy
does not have a particularly large prison population, compared with
other countries, but its prisons are old and overcrowded.
</P>
<P>
   They are supposed to hold up to 43,000 people _ 9,000 fewer than
now. San Vittore, which has 1,800 inmates, is designed for 800;
half its inmates are foreign.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, an amnesty would be only a stopgap. Judicial
sloth, unless special steps are taken, will continue to be a major
offender.
</P>
<P>
   Half of Italy's inmates are on remand, waiting to be tried. In
Naples alone, some 578,000 cases are pending. Of the 9 million or
so new cases that crop up every year, many are minor and should not
carry a jail sentence. Judges lack proper staff and computers.
</P>
<P>
   The whole process is so lengthy that more genuine villains now
get off by statute of limitation; almost all sentences of less than
two years are automatically suspended. In that sense, an informal
amnesty is taking place already. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ ``Most black people don't think alike. Most black
people just vote alike,'' says J.C. Watts, a black Republican
congressman from Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   That disjunction between the variety of black views and the
near-unanimity of support for Democrats sent George W. Bush, the
Republicans' presumptive presidential nominee, to Baltimore this
week, to address the annual meeting of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the largest black
political organization.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting heroes such as Jackie Robinson, the first black
professional baseball player, and W.E.B. Du Bois, one of the
NAACP's founders, he tried to lay the groundwork for a
reconciliation between his party and blacks by conceding that
racism still exists in America (which some Republicans have denied)
and by a nostra culpa: ``The party of Lincoln hasn't always carried
the mantle of Lincoln.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush pointed to school reform in Texas, which has raised the
educational standards of minority students, and argued that
``compassionate conservatism'' offered a better alternative to poor
blacks than traditional big-government programs.
</P>
<P>
   The applause was diplomatic and the immediate response polite,
if skeptical. The Rev. Sidney Daniels, a civil-rights leader,
argued that ``in spite of all the promises he seems to be making,
he's still got the idea that private concerns can take over the
work of the government.'' But he gave Bush credit for showing up at
all.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans consistently get a mere 10 percent of the black
vote, plus or minus 5 percent, says David Bositis, a senior
political analyst at the Joint Center for Political and Economic
Studies, a black think-tank in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dole's showing among black voters in 1996, an anemic 13
percent, was still the best the GOP has managed since Dwight
Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   This is not just bad news for Governor Bush; it is bad news for
America's blacks. Although their long identification with the
Democratic Party has allowed some black leaders to emerge, it has
been, for the most part, a Faustian bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic candidates can make token promises to blacks which
can then be conveniently set aside as they dash to the middle for
swing votes, says the Rev Floyd Flake, a former Democratic
congressman from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Republicans, reading the writing on the polls, never
bother to make any meaningful promises in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the Republicans have much to recommend them to blacks,
who often describe themselves as more conservative than whites on a
wide range of issues.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1999 poll conducted by the Joint Center for Political and
Economic Studies, blacks were twice as likely as whites to cite
crime, violence and drugs as the most important problems facing the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks are significantly more likely than whites to support
school vouchers. Most blacks oppose abortion, says Watts (who would
say that). Three in four support school prayer.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans might even trawl for black votes with pocketbook
issues. Since 1970, around 2 million black families have moved into
the middle class (i.e., earning more than $50,000 in 1997 dollars).
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to see why they should be any more enthusiastic about
Democratic poverty programs than their white suburban neighbors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 50 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 550) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The Black Chamber of Commerce supports the repeal of the
inheritance tax. Watts even makes the slightly macabre suggestion
that blacks should favor private individual retirement accounts,
rather than the current system of state-guaranteed Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   They die younger than whites, he reasons. Unclaimed Social
Security benefits revert to the government; but private retirement
savings can be left to the family. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   So will Bush's appeal change minds? Not if the later reaction at
the Baltimore conference is any guide. An hour after he (and the
television crews) had left, Maxine Waters, a Democratic
congresswoman from Los Angeles, took the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we give people an opportunity to talk to us,'' she cried,
`` they should do more than quote our black heroes. When we give
you our platform, come prepared to talk business with us. We're
talking about police abuse, driving while black.'' The hall erupted
in cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, Wendell Anthony, the president of the Detroit branch of
the NAACP (the largest in the country) was even ruder about Bush:
``An empty speech, an abdication of responsibility, he failed
miserably to address our concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans may indeed be the party of Abraham Lincoln, but
the Democrats became the party of Franklin Roosevelt. The New Deal
had much to offer poor blacks. Blacks and Republicans parted ways
more permanently three decades later.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican ``Southern strategy'' of the 1960s successfully
drew Southern whites into the party by opposing civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Kristol, editor of the Weekly Standard, likes to claim that
every voter has a formative political experience: for many black
voters, it was the civil-rights era.
</P>
<P>
   Above all there is a basic lack of trust in the Republican
Party. ``If you don't trust,'' argues Bositis, ``issues really are
irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders compound their problems, he adds, with
``fool's errands'': defending the Confederate flag, visiting Bob
Jones University, holding up the appointments of black judges and
ambassadors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 875) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   However, at the local level, Republican hopes for some sort of
modest realignment look more realistic. As the Rev. Buster Soaries,
an adviser to (Republican) Governor Christine Todd Whitman in New
Jersey, puts it, ``There has been a lot of black political power
without a corresponding gain in welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican governors have done well with black voters. John
Engler earned 27 percent of the black vote in Michigan in 1998, the
same portion as Bush in Texas; Mrs. Whitman did similarly well in
New Jersey. Republican mayors, such as Bret Schundler in Jersey
City, have done even better.
</P>
<P>
   These state and local Republicans are more pragmatic than their
congressional colleagues. They are closer to the people and have
overcome black mistrust by letting their policies do the talking.
</P>
<P>
   They are also predominantly from the Northeast and Midwest,
where there is a kinder, gentler brand of Republicanism. ``They're
a different Republican Party,'' says Bositis. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,175) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Nobody expects Bush to pick up 27 percent of the national black
vote in 2000. No candidate can reclaim goodwill lost over half a
century. But future elections might be a different story.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to get elected to do those things,'' says Kristol,
who reckons that a compassionate George W. Bush, elected in 2000,
could double his vote among blacks in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Hess, a political scholar at the Brookings Institution,
tells a story (probably apocryphal) about Brigham Young. The Mormon
visionary reached Utah with his followers and promptly decreed that
half of them would be Democrats and half Republicans: that way,
their votes would never be taken for granted.
</P>
<P>
   America would be a better place with more black Republicans.
That is not a bad place to start. &QL;

   BATON ROUGE, La. _ A late summer morning and the sun was already
harsh on the dusty high school football field. The shirtless blond
19-year-old in shorts stained with sweat kept dropping back to
pass, his hands at times so wet it was hard to grip the ball. He
was throwing to a friend, working ``up the ladder,'' as it is
called, starting with short passes and ending long.
</P>
<P>
   But his mind wasn't totally on his receiver. He could feel the
eyes of the man in the dark glasses who sat in a car on the other
side of a chain-link fence, a hundred yards away.
</P>
<P>
   The boy knew the man was watching. It had been subtly arranged.
The National Collegiate Athletic Association does not allow
tryouts, but if a college coach happens by a field where kids
regularly throw the ball around, well, a coach may argue, where's
the harm?
</P>
<P>
   At that time, in July 1996, Southern University, a football
powerhouse among black colleges, desperately needed a quarterback,
and the boy, Marcus Jacoby, badly needed a place to play
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   After half an hour, the man in dark glasses, Mark Orlando,
Southern's offensive coordinator, had seen enough and drove off.
</P>
<P>
   It had gone well. The boy was invited to the coach's apartment,
where after a short visit he was offered a full football
scholarship. The coach explained that the boy had a shot at the
starting job, that the presumed starter had flunked off the team
and that the two remaining backups did not have the coaches'
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sounds good,'' said Jacoby, who had been a star at Catholic
High, one of Baton Rouge's schoolboy powers. ``But I have to think
about it _ talk with my parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Jacoby was unaware that if he accepted the scholarship,
he would be the first white to play quarterback for Southern
University. And he would be the first white ever to start at
quarterback in the 76-year history of the black Southwestern
Athletic Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby had grown up in Baton Rouge, and yet he knew practically
nothing about Southern, had never even been to the other side of
town to see the campus. Until that July day, he had spent his life
surrounded by whites.
</P>
<P>
   THE BUSINESS OF HOW TO SUCCEED
</P>
<P>
   In three his years as Southern's head coach, Pete Richardson had
turned a laughingstock of a program into a national force. Southern
won 11 of 12 games his first year, 1993, and two years later it was
the No. 1 black college in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   It is not easy for a black man to become a head coach. Despite
his record, Richardson, 54, has never had an offer from a Division
I college; only three of those 500 institutions have black head
football coaches. Instead he worked his way around the black
college circuit, serving as an assistant in Texas and Arkansas,
then taking the head coach's job at Winston-Salem State in North
Carolina, and finally, in 1993, getting his big break at Southern,
the largest historically black college in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson and Marcus' parents, Glen and Marian Jacoby,
discussed everything from Southern's rich athletic tradition to the
engineering courses that interested Marcus, but for a long while
they didn't mention the thing that worried the parents most. The
quarterback is the team leader. Would a black team accept a white
leader? Would the black campus?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think it will be that big a deal,'' said
Richardson. ``Sure, there will be some adjustments from all sides.
But Marcus will have the backing of the administration as well as
the coaching staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson pointed out that there were other minorities on
campus. He meant that of the 10,500 students, 5 percent were not
black, but what Mrs. Jacoby kept thinking about was how it would
feel to be in a stadium with her husband and 30,000 black fans.
</P>
<P>
   The coach didn't say it to the Jacobys, but no one knew better
than he about the strain that Marcus would feel being a minority.
As a successful black man, Richardson was used to the stares of
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   When he coached at Winston-Salem, he had a state government car.
``Whites look at you and ask you what you're doing driving the
state's car,'' he said. ``You pull over to get some gas and people
will address you the wrong way or policemen will look at you
funny.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach thought he could make this Jacoby thing work. He
wasn't sitting there fretting whether Marcus could learn to be a
minority. There was no time for that. The first game was six weeks
away. As he would say later, his first-string quarterback had
flunked out and he didn't have ``ample time to find another black
quarterback.'' Marcus would have to do what all good football
players did, what Richardson himself had done: suck it up.
</P>
<P>
   To reassure the Jacobys, the coach told them about his staff. Of
six assistants he had hired when he started in 1993, two were
white, one Asian. He was told that Southern fans would never stand
for that. But after his 11-1 debut season _ the year before they
had been 6-5 _ a popular T-shirt on campus featured a photo of the
integrated staff, with the words ``In Living Color.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning, Richardson knew, often made problems go away. ``I don't
care what color Marcus is,'' Richardson said. ``If I believe he can
help our football team, I want him.''
</P>
<P>
   HARD WORK OR PRIVILEGE?
</P>
<P>
   From the Jacobys' home, in the upper-middle class white Tara
section of Baton Rouge, Southern was a 20-minute car trip,
literally to the other side of the tracks. As Marcus drove to the
first practice, he began imagining himself playing a game, he
recalled. ``Would I see a white face?''
</P>
<P>
   Southern's decision to sign a white quarterback made headlines,
first locally, then nationally, and the reaction of some whites he
knew startled him. When Jacoby called his girlfriend to talk about
it, her mother answered. ``The niggers over there will kill you,''
he recalled her saying. ``There are bullets flying all over the
place. It's a war zone.'' When his girlfriend got on the phone, she
said, ``Marcus, I don't want you to call me again.''
</P>
<P>
   To many on the white side of town, who had never visited this
campus bustling with middle-class black students on the bluffs of
the Mississippi, it was as if Jacoby had voluntarily moved to the
ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern coaches were impressed with Jacoby's arm and had
never seen a quarterback learn Richardson's complex offense so
fast. The other quarterback hopefuls would leave practice at 6, but
Jacoby stayed to do extra throwing and often studied game films
well past midnight. Within days of arriving, he was first-string.
</P>
<P>
   That sparked anger among many of his new black teammates. For
more than a year they had been friendly with the two quarterbacks
now relegated to backup, and they resented the newcomer,
complaining that he had not earned his stripes.

 &UR; BATON ROUGE, La.: his stripes. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several felt the decision was racial. ``It just became the fact
that we were going to have this white quarterback,'' said Sam
George, a quarterback prospect who was academically ineligible that
year. ``It wasn't about ability no more.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for the coaches, Jacoby was isolated. In the locker room,
he recalled, ``I would walk around the corner and people would just
stop talking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day at lunch,'' he said, ``I'd sit down at a table full
of guys without being invited and they would continue their
conversations as if I wasn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in the huddles there was dissension. Scott Cloman, a
Southern receiver, recalled: ``The minute Marcus was like,
`Everybody calm down, just shut up,' they were like: `Who are you
talking to? You're not talking to me.' You know, stuff like that.
If it was a black person it wouldn't be a problem. They all felt
that `I'm not going to let a white person talk to me like that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   His entire time at Southern, Jacoby kept his feelings about all
this inside, sucking it up, repeatedly telling the stream of
inquiring reporters what a great experience it was being exposed to
a new culture. ``As soon as I signed and walked onto the campus,''
he said to one interviewer, ``I felt like part of the family. I
definitely feel at home here.''
</P>
<P>
   SCHOOL AND STUDENTS IN STEP
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 7, 1996, six weeks after Jacoby arrived, Southern
opened its season away, at Northwestern State, with him at
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Morgan, a supervisor at the local Exxon plant who attended
Southern in the 1960s, is one of many middle-aged black men who
rarely miss a practice, let alone a game. His wife, his mother and
his aunt graduated from Southern, too, as did 25 other relatives.
And now, his son Jabari, a drummer, who had dreamed of being in the
famous Southern band since he was a little boy, was out there
marching for the first time, a freshman living out his fantasy on
that same September day.
</P>
<P>
   Families like the Morgans were fiercely proud of their school
and its role in helping generations of blacks into the middle and
professional classes _ even if the state had long treated it as
second-rate.
</P>
<P>
   But Southern had become the flagship of the nation's largest
historically black public university system, with 15,000 students
on three campuses.
</P>
<P>
   But by the mid-1990s, change was brewing. The year before Jacoby
arrived, Southern and LSU settled a 20-year-old federal
desegregation lawsuit. LSU pledged to double its black enrollment;
Southern pledged to double its nonblack enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   Alumni like the Morgans worried. Would Southern soon become just
another satellite campus of LSU? Were black public colleges facing
extinction? Was the white quarterback the beginning of the end?
</P>
<P>
   But Jabari could not have cared less, he was so consumed with
the band. It didn't matter to Jabari if Jacoby was purple, as long
as Southern won and people came to see the halftime show.
</P>
<P>
   A MUTINOUS BEGINNING
</P>
<P>
   Southern lost its first two games. The team was young _ 10 of 11
offensive starters were new _ but what people remembered was the
11-1 record from the year before.
</P>
<P>
   During the second loss, Jacoby recalls, ``I heard the entire
stadium booing me.'' Fans were yelling, ``Get the white boy out!''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Williams, a Southern offensive lineman, believed that the
opposing team hit Jacoby harder because he was white. Cloman
recalled that after one Southern loss, opposing players said,
``That's what you all get for bringing white boys on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby was hit so hard and so often the first game that he was
hospitalized with a concussion. In the school paper, a columnist
wrote about the ``Jacoby nonblocking scandal'': ``Someone should
validate or refute the current rumor that Southern's offensive line
(or some of its members) purposely missed blocks.'' But Jacoby
still believes that it was just the mistakes of an inexperienced
line.
</P>
<P>
   After Southern's second straight loss, an angry fan confronted
Jacoby and threatened him. A coach had to jump between them. For
the rest of his career, Jacoby would have a police escort at games.
</P>
<P>
   WINNING WORKS WONDERS
</P>
<P>
   Southern won six of its next seven games, beating the two
top-ranked black colleges, and was invited to the Heritage Bowl in
Atlanta, the black college championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't getting booed nearly as much,'' Jacoby said. Some
teammates began warming to him. ``Things had changed,'' he said,
``to the extent that some of the players were calling me `the
man.'''
</P>
<P>
   He felt he was developing real friendships with several
teammates and Southern students. When Cloman needed a place to stay
for a month, Jacoby had him to his parents' home and the two grew
close. ``Marcus was the first white person I ever really got to
know,'' recalled Cloman. ``I always felt a lot of tension around
whites. I'd go into a store and I could just feel the tension.
Sometimes you just feel like, `I can't stand white people.' I
didn't understand them. I really didn't want to be near them.
</P>
<P>
   ``His parents treated me like a son,'' said Cloman. Some players
now joked when they saw Cloman, ``Where's your brother?'' ``And
some,'' he said, ``called me `white lover.' Didn't bother me. I had
come to understand the Jacobys. A lot of times people fear what
they can't understand. Because of being around the Jacobys my
attitude toward whites in general changed.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Heritage Bowl that first year, on national television,
Southern took a 24-10 halftime lead against Howard University, then
fell behind, 27-24. In the closing minute, Southern drove to
Howard's 15-yard line. On third down, with 42 seconds left, Jacoby
dropped back, and under pressure, threw off the wrong foot,
floating a pass into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard the crowd gasp,'' he said. ``I couldn't believe this
was happening.'' He'd been intercepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dragged myself off the field and sat on a bench and buried
my head in my arms,'' said Jacoby.
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby said a few people came by and patted him on the back, to
be encouraging. ``But I heard, `You screwed up real bad this time,
whitey.' And: `You're as dumb as they come.' It was the lowest
point of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-RACE-SPORTS-ABRIDGED-ART-3RDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; BATON ROUGE, La.: my life.'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Orlando, the defensive coordinator, who is
white, received an anonymous call: ``If Jacoby ever plays for
Southern again, we'll kill him _ and you.'' He said he had been
averaging a threat a week that season. A few weeks later as Orlando
and Jacoby left the locker room and headed to their cars, Orlando
pointed to several trees. Jacoby could see a yellow rope hung from
each tree. The ropes were tied in nooses.
</P>
<P>
   THE EYES OF SOUTHERN ARE UPON HIM
</P>
<P>
   On campus, Jacoby struggled with all the daily irritations that
go with being the minority. As a white who grew up among whites, he
was used to being inconspicuous. Here, he always felt on display.
``I hated that,'' he said, ``because it was like I had become just
a novelty act.''
</P>
<P>
   College is a place where young people are confronted with new
ideas _ sometimes only partially understood _ and encouraged to
speak out about them. And yet Jacoby felt that when he did, he was
criticized. At first, in his African American history class, when
slavery was discussed, he said he tried to be conciliatory. ``I
would say something like, `I kind of feel for you.' And it was
like, `Quit Uncle Tomming.'''
</P>
<P>
   Then he worried he wasn't being true to his white roots. ``I
felt that I had lost my pride and the respect of friends that I had
grown up with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For one oral report, he decided to speak his mind and said that
it was unhealthy for blacks to dwell too much on past racial
violence. ``There have been tragedies like slavery throughout
time,'' he said. ``I don't think one is more important than any
other.'' When he finished, he recalled, ``there was an eerie
silence and I saw at least three or four people glaring at me.''
</P>
<P>
   COMEBACK AND COMPETITION
</P>
<P>
   What got Jacoby through his second year at Southern was a
determination to avenge that Heritage Bowl interception, to show
everyone he could be a champion. He moved through the 1997 season
with a passion.
</P>
<P>
   Again, he was first string, but he had competition. Sam George
had returned from academic probation. George was a popular figure
on campus, known for his hard-partying ways. Though he was only
5'7,'' he had a strong arm and terrific speed. He excited fans with
his scrambling derring-do. ``And,'' said Scott Cloman, ``he was
black.''
</P>
<P>
   While Jacoby started, Richardson liked bringing in George when
the team seemed flat and needed a spark. Both quarterbacks saw race
as the true reason behind Richardson's substitutions. Jacoby was
convinced the coach was giving the black quarterback playing time
in order to pander to black fans; George was convinced Richardson
was starting the white quarterback as part of Southern's promise to
be more diversified.
</P>
<P>
   George wound up playing in 5 of 12 games. By Southern's third
game, against Arkansas Pine-Bluff, both quarterbacks were bitter.
After winning their first two, Southern was losing to Pine-Bluff
7-6 at the half, when Richardson decided to bring in George. Jacoby
was devastated; he felt he was a proven winner and shouldn't be
yanked for one bad half.
</P>
<P>
   George threw a last-ditch 37-yard pass on a scramble play that
tied the game, and threw another touchdown in triple overtime for a
36-33 Southern win.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, come Monday practice, Jacoby was the starter again.
George was frustrated and perplexed.
</P>
<P>
   Southern had a 9-1 record going into its two final games. A win
in the next game _ the Bayou Classic, against archrival Grambling _
would assure a return to the Heritage Bowl and a chance for Jacoby
to redeem himself.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando suggested that if Jacoby played a little more like
George, sometimes scrambling out of the pocket, he might be more
effective. Jacoby felt that he was being told to become something
he was not, but he was so desperate, so worn down and nervous about
being yanked, he followed the coach's advice. He ran as he rarely
had before, and it worked. In a 30-7 win against Grambling, Jacoby
threw three touchdowns and played the entire game. He was named the
Bayou Classic's most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   A month later he achieved his football redemption, throwing the
winning touchdown pass in a 34-28 Heritage Bowl victory over South
Carolina State, capping an 11-1 season that earned Southern the
black national championship. ``I was happier than I had ever been
at Southern,'' he recalled. On the trip back from Atlanta he slept
soundly for the first time in months.
</P>
<P>
   THE GOING GETS TOUGH
</P>
<P>
   The more you achieve, the more that's expected. After that 11-1
season, the talk on campus was that Southern would go undefeated in
1998. But in the opener, trailing 7-0 at the half, Jacoby was
pulled for Sam George. Southern lost anyway, 28-7.
</P>
<P>
   In practice on Tuesday, Jacoby overthrew a pass to one of his
ends, John Forman, and Forman yelled at him in front of everybody.
</P>
<P>
   Forman would say later that it was just the frustration of
having lost the opener, but to Jacoby it was so much more, the
final straw. Forman was Sam George's roommate. He was sure Forman
was trying to subvert his control of the team to help George. He
was sure it was race. ``It was like I was right back where I had
started two years before, with a lot of the same attitudes against
me. I felt I had lost the team.''
</P>
<P>
   He quit, football and Southern.
</P>
<P>
   NO MORE APOLOGIES
</P>
<P>
   Richardson was surprised and asked Jacoby to stay. But more
recently, he said, he understood Jacoby's decision. Because of
``the type person he is,'' the coach said, ``it was the best thing
for Marcus because it would have killed him.'' Richardson meant
Jacoby just wasn't emotionally equipped to continue being the
solitary white.
</P>
<P>
   When Branch Rickey of the Brooklyn Dodgers wanted to break major
league baseball's color line in 1947, he chose Jackie Robinson, not
simply because he was a great black ballplayer _ there were greater
black stars. He knew Robinson had experience inside white
institutions. Robinson was 28 that first year in the majors, a
mature man who had graduated UCLA and served in the U.S. Army.
Jackie Robinson knew what it was like to be the minority.
</P>
<P>
   When Richardson went after Jacoby, he was just looking for a
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters hounded Jacoby to find why he left, but until now, he
has never spoken openly about it. He had never mentioned race. In
brief interviews, he told them he was burned out, and in a sense
this was true. He had burned out on being the minority. And as a
white, he didn't have to be. ``You kind of look over your shoulder
and see your old life and you say, `I could go back.'''
</P>
<P>
   A white quarterback at Southern did make people think. Mo Morgan
had been against it at the start, but after watching Jacoby at
practices, he changed. ``I looked at the three quarterbacks that
were there and he was the best at the time. I'm just telling you
straight out. It wasn't his ability and I'm not saying he was
brighter than the other kids. He just put in the work.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby moved on to attend LSU, majoring in finance, but his
Southern experience still unsettled him. At times, he talks about
being lucky to have experienced another culture, but at other
moments, he describes it as ``two and a half years of a personal
hell.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, he appreciates walking around anonymously on the
mostly-white LSU campus. ``I got burned out as far as being
somebody,'' he said. ``At LSU, I've just enjoyed being a part of
the crowd.''

&HT;     OLD TV SEASON WASN'T SO BAD AFTER ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK McGUIRE  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ After the networks spent a year freaking out
_ first over the surprise success of ``Who Wants to Be
Millionaire,'' then the ``Survivor'' reality phenomenon _ they
neglected to take care of one teeny, bottom-of-the-pile task:
developing a really good show for next year.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from what has been seen so far at the gathering of the
nation's television critics _ and it could change before the fall
debuts _ there are no new shows worth getting jazzed about. Indeed,
the 2000-2001 television season (which won't start in earnest until
October, because of the Summer Olympics) only makes us appreciate
the quality of last fall's slate.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, there were close to a half-dozen new shows to get
excited about. ``Action,'' ``Freaks and Geeks,'' ``Now and Again''
were three very good pilots that didn't even make it to a second
season. (No, I didn't forget about all the other garbage that came
out last year.)
</P>
<P>
   This year, after mining and extrapolating and heaping globs of
wishful thinking, the best you can come up with is two or three.
</P>
<P>
   Most of NBC's fall lineup appears to be a disaster waiting to
happen. The pilot for the new sitcom from Michael Richards (Kramer
on ``Seinfeld'') was reportedly so bad that it was never allowed
within an area code of critics. ``Ed'' (facing tough competition on
Sunday night) appears solid, and the newspaper drama ``Deadline''
is an unknown quantity because the pilot has yet to be released,
but the rest of the new schedule is so weak, officials better
introduce a new slogan: ``We Were No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC has only four new shows to roll out; Regis Philbin,
apparently, can handle the other 19.5 hours of prime time.
``Gideon's Crossing,'' thanks to the presence of Andre Braugher and
Ruben Blades, exudes potential. Geena Davis' sitcom, cleverly
titled ``Geena,'' does not and wouldn't, even if you added Lucille
Ball, Jerry Seinfeld, Sid Caesar and Carol Burnett to the cast.
</P>
<P>
   And ``The Trouble With Normal''? Well, let me save for another
day my rant on that piece of ... art.
</P>
<P>
   CBS's dramas look slick, but nothing jumps out as a must-see,
although ``Bette,'' from Bette Midler, has some very amusing
moments.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Fox, still trying to find a successor for ``The
X-Files'' even as it desperately holds on to its dramatic flagship;
its slate of dark dramas makes the movie ``Seven'' look like a
knee-slapping farce. One important caveat here: Critics have yet to
see Fox's David E. Kelley teaching drama ``Boston Public.''
</P>
<P>
   The WB has yet to present a must-see pilot, although the
behind-the-scenes spoof ``Grosse Point'' has a chance to be a funny
send-up of ``Beverly Hills 90210.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, UPN has ``Freedom,'' a drama set in a future America
ruled by a military dictatorship; it should be the top-ranked show
in secluded compounds across northern Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the warnings: Pilots can be tinkered, retooled,
refurbished, recast and reshot before airing, and sometimes shows
develop into something much stronger than the initial episodes
suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Another important point: Television critics, individually and
collectively, sometimes make bad calls on shows. If you went back a
few years, I'll bet no more than a few out of the 200 in attendance
thought ``Providence'' would be a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, let's not forget that we still have some broadcast
heavyweights returning: ``The Simpsons,'' ``ER,'' ``Frasier,''
``The Practice,'' ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ``Friends,'' as
well as new classics from last season like ``The West Wing'' and
``Malcolm in the Middle.''
</P>
<P>
   All is not lost.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not all that much to get excited about.

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Many floral design specialists will tell you that
the frog is the secret of floral arranging.
</P>
<P>
   To a horticulturalist, the word frog conjures the image of a
tool that supports the stems of flowers and keeps them in a desired
shape.
</P>
<P>
   They can be made from glass, china, concrete, pottery, ceramic,
metal or wire that provides support and stability.
</P>
<P>
   Customarily, dark frogs are used in dark vases and clear or
light colored ones in light vases, so that they seem to disappear
in water.
</P>
<P>
   Floral frogs are also known by other names, such as a flower
brick, holder, block or arranger. Kenzan is the Japanese word for
flower arranging frogs (or pins).
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being functional, frogs have also become very
collectible.
</P>
<P>
   Some people collect artistic figural frogs, which are shaped
like animals or have a statue rising out of the center. Bathing
beauty flower frogs (of women in swimsuits) were made in Germany in
the 1920s. English Glass frogs produced in the 1920s and '30s were
Britain's answer to American Depression Glass.
</P>
<P>
   Some frogs may also be used as candleholders, paperweights or
purely as a display collection.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, commercial florists switched from floral frogs,
which date to the 14th century, to water absorbing single-use foam
blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Other options for anchoring a cut arrangement are clear or
colored marbles, small pebbles, florists' tape crisscrossed across
the top of the container to form a grid, or a supple twig, curled
and forced into the vase. A piece of crumpled chicken wire tucked
into the vase or taped across the top will also do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   Frogs made by glass manufacturers may cost hundreds of dollars
today, but the average price for a new glass, metal or wire frog
ranges from $3 for a small round plain needle frog to $30 or more.
Frogs made between 1910 and '40 are currently very collectible.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity-owned frogs may often cost more, as in the case of
those owned by the late Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Her floral
frogs and a couple of metal containers sold at auction for $4,025
in 1996.

   LAKE GEORGE, N.Y. _ Dylan Wilcox and sister Chelsea stood 30
feet from a busy, jungle-gym-equipped playground at Shepard Park
last week as climbing, rambunctious children filled the air with
cheers of happiness.
</P>
<P>
   Dylan, 12, and Chelsea, 14, went to Shepard Park to play, too _
but in a different sense of the word. The siblings, who live in
White Creek, N.Y., are the principal members of the band GreayStar,
which recently signed a seven-album deal with Epic Records.
</P>
<P>
   Chelsea, the lead vocalist, has the stage presence of an angry
Gwen Stefani, and Dylan is a guitar phenom. While comparisons to
Jimi Hendrix are still a stretch, Dylan already has skills that
many 20- or 30-year-olds only dream about.
</P>
<P>
   During GreayStar's two-hour set in Shepard Park in this upstate
New York village, the band rocked the perpetually growing crowd
with hard-driving, post-punk tunes, all of them originals. At the
beginning of the performance, most of those in the park carried on
with typical summertime activities, more interested in their ice
cream and the day's last rays than some unknown local band. But by
the end of the night a parkful of GreayStar converts buzzed about
Dylan's scorching guitar licks.
</P>
<P>
   Their father and band manager, Jay Wilcox, has been involved in
music all of his life, and is amazed at Dylan's abilities. ``Just
imagine what he'll be able to do when he's 16!''
</P>
<P>
   Dylan started playing the guitar at age 6 but had been watching
his father play and clapping along since he was 2.
</P>
<P>
   The Wilcox children were noticed by Randy Cantor, a music
producer who worked on Ricky Martin's ``Livin' La Vida Loca,'' when
they played at the Philadelphia Music Conference in January. Cantor
was at the conference to discuss Latin music, but his priorities
quickly shifted. Like many in attendance, Jay Wilcox said, Cantor
was impressed by the talent of the Wilcox kids _ so much so that he
immediately called Peter Robinson, Epic Records' senior vice
president of A&AMP;R (artist and repertoire).
</P>
<P>
   ``They both have a lot of potential,'' Robinson said of the
Wilcoxes, adding, ``Dylan is a very musical young guy. He has a
great feel for music.''
</P>
<P>
   Known for signing The Dave Matthews Band while working for RCA
Records, Robinson spoke with the band after the Philadelphia show,
and set up an appointment to travel to their home _ a nearly
four-hour trip from his Manhattan office _ in early February. Wowed
by that living-room performance, Robinson took GreayStar to an
audition for Epic bigwigs on Valentine's Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Wilcox kids again impressed seen-it-all record executives,
Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   During the audition, Dylan showed his musical savvy by
improvising in the middle of a song he'd never before played.
``He's always changing music as he goes along,'' said his father.
``Nobody knows it except for a few of us, but he just makes up a
lot along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Wilcoxes now live in White Creek, where they have an
in-house studio in which they practice for up to four hours a day.
Jay Wilcox writes most of the lyrics, and works with Dylan on
composing the guitar and rhythm elements of GreayStar's songs.
</P>
<P>
   The band's drummer, 17-year-old Nick Callonnec, is awed by
Dylan's tremendous knowledge and talent. ``He blows my mind away,''
said Callonnec. ``He's 12 years old, and playing lead guitar!''
</P>
<P>
   Callonnec was connected to GreayStar by his father, Roger
Callonnec, who became Dylan's guitar teacher after Jay Wilcox could
no longer keep up with the boy. Roger Callonnec occasionally fills
in on bass guitar with the band, when regular bass player Kevin
Martindale is unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   Dylan was surrounded by music his whole life, having been
influenced by his father's '70s favorites, but it wasn't until
hearing one popular '90s punk band that he was inspired to make
music his main priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once Green Day started, Dylan's life changed,'' Jay Wilcox
said. Dylan's other influences range from Hendrix to Tom Morello of
Rage Against The Machine.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Wilcox has said the contract with Epic is in the
mid-five-figure range, but he declined to discuss it in detail.
Like most contracts today, the seven albums are not guaranteed.
Instead, the deal allows Epic the option to pursue more recordings
if the company believes the Wilcoxes have hit potential.
</P>
<P>
   This summer will be used for development of Dylan and Chelsea as
performers (the contract covers only them, not the rest of
GreayStar's members). The two spend the beginning of each week
rehearsing and recording in New York City with studio musicians
chosen for them by Epic. Robinson said he hopes the band, which is
also working on a video, will have four singles done by September.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the first set in Shepard Park, Dylan played so
ferociously that his guitar strap (which covers nearly his entire
back with its width) came off, and he almost dropped the
instrument.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you see how I caught the guitar?'' he said excitedly.
``That was awesome!''

 &HT;     By KRISTEN MACK  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Slang is increasingly becoming part of common language. It is
unavoidable, whether on television or out of the mouths of teens.
In the 2000 edition of the Random House Webster's College
Dictionary, released this week, there are 303 new words appearing
for the first time among the 200,000-plus definitions.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the new words come from slang. Among them war:
my bad! (my mistake) 24/7 (continually, constantly) and candy
(someone or something that is excellent, pleasing or pleasurable).
How long they will be current is another question.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is always hard to know what the staying power of slang
is,'' said George Aaron Broadwell, director of the program in
linguistics and cognitive science at the State University of New
York at Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Lexicographers, the people who put the dictionary together, have
to balance the needs of several different audiences. One audience
consists of linguists and non-native speakers of English.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two groups will want a source that faithfully documents
every word that is commonly in use in spoken English, regardless of
whether the word is `proper' or not,'' Broadwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Someone learning English needs to be able to find ``arm candy''
in the dictionary, because he or she won't be able to figure it out
otherwise, according to Broadwell.
</P>
<P>
   But lexicographers must also consider the audience of people who
are concerned with the correct usage of English. They tend to
regard the fact that a word is in the dictionary as evidence that
it is in fact a correct and accepted part of the language.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two groups come into conflict with new words and slang
where it may take a commonly used word some time before it becomes
accepted or regarded as correct,'' Broadwell said. ``Some words and
phrases have been around for decades, while others seem to last
only a few months.''
</P>
<P>
   In the vernacular, there is recent evidence of slang being
overused to the point of saturation, bordering on lame. So if you
have used the phrases ``you go, girl,'' or ``talk to the hand ...''
frequently in the last year, you may want to stop. Don't mean to
dis, but it's wack. Even though both of those words have made it
into the dictionary, if you want to be considered up-to-date,
refrain now from using them.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are those words that surpass trendiness and
come into common usage, like chill, cool or awesome.
</P>
<P>
   But for every word that makes it, there are probably two that
never quite stick. For instance, in 1997, Random House added
Macarena, a then-popular dance craze and song, to the dictionary.
But it faded, and didn't have the perennial appeal of say, the
tango, so it was taken out in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   No word is written in stone. If it's dying out or played out, it
can be easily snatched out from a dictionary. Just as easily
though, it can be put back in. Capris and cargo pants were recently
re-inserted because they have come back into fashion.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes a word will have been around for decades before it
makes it into the dictionary. The word Ebonics, or black English,
has around for about 30 years, but just made it in the dictionary a
couple years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The dating of a word is difficult, according to Carol Braham,
the Random House senior editor in charge of the day-to-day
development of the dictionary. Braham searches on-line databases
and old slang dictionaries to find the history of a word.
</P>
<P>
   When adding words, Random House studies semantics and
morphology, and how words change in meaning and form over time.
</P>
<P>
   Take the word bad. Michael Jackson released an album titled,
``Bad'' (Epic), in 1987. Starting then, we began to take the word
less literally. And, in 1989, LL Cool J coined the phrase, ``Not
bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good,'' in his song, ``I'm Bad''
(Def Jam).
</P>
<P>
   Edgy, which most of us think of as nervous and jittery, has a
new definition this year, referring to something that's innovative
and cutting edge.
</P>
<P>
   Dis is a shortened form of the word disrespect. Dis came into
usage between 1980 and 1985 _ for most entries Random House
includes the dates, parenthetically. Words such as typewrite,
lifestyle and roundtrip started off as two words, and then became
hyphenated, before eventually evolving into one word. It's the
natural process of word formation, according to Braham.
</P>
<P>
   Jiggy, which means ``wonderful and exciting, especially because
stylish,'' made it into the dictionary this year after its frequent
rotation on radios across America in Will Smith's song, ``Gettin'
Jiggy Wit It'' (Sony).
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't make it up, but he popularized it,'' Braham said.
</P>
<P>
   In general, a lexicographer will want some evidence that a word
is being widely used, and it is not just the jargon of some
restricted group. Evidence might include use in national
publications, frequency of use on the Internet, in songs,
advertisements or conversations. Random House contends that new
words can come from wherever language happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our editors are always scanning these sources, and many people
also send us new words or meanings in the mail,'' said Wendalyn
Nichols, the editorial director of Random House Reference.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New technology and slang are the biggest sources of new words.
Each year, Braham creates a list of words for inclusion, along with
their citations. She searches files, databases and the Internet to
determine how frequently words are used, their range of uses, and
even their variant spellings.
</P>
<P>
   In any given year, more than 1,000 new words are considered for
placement in the dictionary. Words with staying power are the most
likely to succeed. The number of words that make it in varies each
year. In the latest edition, there are the 303 new entries
definitions of old words.
</P>
<P>
   A dictionary is a living record of language, it's not static,
according to Braham, who said that words are not invented in the
dictionary, just recorded.
</P>
<P>
   While Broadwell says lexicographers are making a judgment call
and probably err on the side of including most words, Braham says
neither she nor the rest of the selection committee is making an
ethical decision when putting words in the dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't make a judgment as to whether it's nice or has any
good value or is even correct,'' Braham said. ``If it's used and
used widely, then I put it in.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the terms Driving While Black and racial profiling
were included in the dictionary. Braham said they were added
because they have been in the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing that we're making up,'' Braham said. ``We don't
create the language, we just record it.''

   TEXAS-PRIDE (Houston) _ For months now, Vice President Al Gore
and other national Democrats have pounded away at George W. Bush's
record in Texas, reciting a litany of unflattering statistics while
all but equating the state with Outer Mongolia. Not surprisingly,
Texans, a prideful lot, have taken offense. The criticism seems to
be scratching at deep psychological territory, reinforcing the
belief held by many Texans that outsiders still regard the state as
a hothouse of violence and ignorance and pickup trucks. By Jim
Yardley.

   NY-GENETICS-PROTEST (Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.) _ Vandals mowed
down a cornfield last week that the late geneticist Barbara
McClintock started in the 1940s to do the Nobel-winning research
that laid the groundwork for today's genome work. It sets
experiments back only a few weeks, but officials at the Cold Spring

HILLARY IS NOT AN ANTI-SEMITE

<TEXT>
<P>
   You can say a lot of things about Hillary Clinton, but the
allegations that she's anti-Semitic sound like a big crock of
rotten politics to me.
</P>
<P>
   That said, I find her denial hard to fathom.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, ``State of a Union: Inside the Complex Marriage of
Bill and Hillary Clinton'' by former National Enquirer scribe Jerry
Oppenheimer, will land on bookstore shelves with the resounding
thud of an ``event book'' _ a publication that has the media
chirping in advance. In this case it's because of a report Matt
Drudge (Matt!) that was picked up by everyone: the claim that in
1974, Mrs. Clinton called one of her husband's campaign aides a
``f------ Jew bastard'' on the night Clinton lost a congressional
race.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Mrs. Clinton was calling a news conference to deny the
report and her husband was phoning the New York Daily News from the
Camp David Middle East peace summit to say his wife has ``never,
ever uttered an ethnic or racial slur against anybody, ever,'' the
gecko-like Dick Morris was offering his own unique brand of slimy
innuendo on Fox News.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Hillary is an anti-Semite, but I do think she
has, in my dealings with her, she's always had a consciousness that
she's talking to somebody who's Jewish,'' said Morris, who went on
to tell anecdotes about Mrs. Clinton supposedly making jokes to him
about eating pork and saying things like, ``Money, that's all you
people care about is money.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. It's always difficult to believe someone who has just
crawled out from under a rock in order to appear on a cable news
channel.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to say for sure whether Hillary Clinton spat out
an anti-Semitic insult more than a quarter-century ago, unless we
hear from some Nixon-inspired operator who was lingering nearby
with a tape recorder, but I choose to believe her word over the
claim of the book's author, a former National Enquirer reporter _
especially in light of the fact that the putative target of Mrs.
Clinton's ire is not Jewish. (His paternal grandmother was Jewish.)
</P>
<P>
   But in issuing her denial, Mrs. Clinton made some claims that I
find even more unfathomable than the allegations against her.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, I may have called someone a name, but I have
never used ethnic, racial, anti-Semitic, bigoted, discriminatory,
prejudiced accusations against anybody,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never done it. I've never thought it.''
</P>
<P>
   Never thought it? Wow. I always figured that even the likes of
Gandhi and Mother Teresa had their moments of internal weakness in
which they experienced prejudiced thoughts, even as they were
performing heroic feats of almost incomprehensible self-sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Hillary Clinton says she's never uttered a bigoted
statement, never thought an prejudiced thought.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about the senate, she oughta be campaigning for
sainthood.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of New York politicians _ and sorry for that mild
whiplash of a segue _ I just came across a surprising appearance by
moral crusader Rudy Giuliani in the latest issue of a steamy,
boundary-stretching publication.
</P>
<P>
   A grinning Giuliani is interviewed in the ``Back to School''
edition of A&AMP;F quarterly, the pseudo-catalog from Abercrombie &AMP;
Fitch that is so risque it costs $6 an issue and is delivered in
kid-discouraging shrink wrap.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy G. even allowed himself to be photographed at City Hall for
the piece, wearing an A&AMP;F hat.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the revelation that Giuliani used to go out in New
York in a disguise of sunglasses or a hat but would be recognized
anyway, there's nothing terribly eyebrow-raising about the cheeky
Q-and-A _ other than its very presence in the catalog.
</P>
<P>
   After all, this is the same Mayor Giuliani who has fought to
have ``objectionable'' art removed from city museums, who has
cleaned up Times Square, who has crusaded against Calvin Klein's
provocative billboards. And now he shows up just a few pages away
from these images:
</P>
<P>
   _ A group of young people in Rudy's beloved Times Square,
including four young men wearing boxers, their pants around their
ankles.
</P>
<P>
   _ A preppie-looking gal stuffing dollar bills into the G-strong
of a tattoeed, male exotic dancer.
</P>
<P>
   _ A gay couple sharing a fond moment in a dorm room.
</P>
<P>
   _ Young men frolicking in a fountain, the way young men will do
when they're frolicking in a fountain. One such muffin has his
pants around his knees, revealing his bare behind.
</P>
<P>
   Nice to know Giuliani has become so ... tolerant.

WILL `WHAT LIES BENEATH' THRILL AUDIENCES?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use after July 21, 2000, by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
You've probably seen either the commercial or trailer for ``What
Lies Beneath.'' Michelle Pfeiffer, wearing a slinky red dress,
straddles Harrison Ford, telling him breathlessly, ``I think she's
starting to suspect something.'' Ford, befuddled, asks, ``Who?''
Pfeiffer, throaty: ``Your (ITAL)wife(END ITAL).''
</P>
<P>
   Great moment. The only problem is that _ like so many movie
trailers today _ the spot spoils a major plot point in the film.
Namely: Harrison Ford's character has had an affair with a woman
who's now haunting his house and, during this particular scene,
inhabiting the body of his wife, played by Pfeiffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``To do our art we need people to go see our movies,'' explains
the film's director Robert Zemeckis, a man who knows a thing or two
about box-office hits with ``Forrest Gump'' and the ``Back to the
Future'' movies on his resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a perfect world, you wouldn't have to show a scene like
that in the trailer. But that's not the world we live in. I equate
it to McDonald's. People go to the movies, and they like to know
exactly what they're going to see before they see it. Nobody wants
to be surprised anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   And that puts Zemeckis at cross purposes with his audience since
``What Lies Beneath'' is a psychological thriller that aims to keep
its audience guessing through numerous plot twists, red herrings
and misdirections. Ford and Pfeiffer play a long-married couple
whose lives begin to unravel after her daughter (by a previous
marriage) goes off to college. A not-so-friendly ghost has taken up
residence in their New England home, and it's soon clear that the
spirit is a scorned woman from Ford's past. Spookiness ensues.
</P>
<P>
   Producer Jack Rapke calls the film the type of movie Alfred
Hitchcock would make if he had access to modern technology;
co-producer and frequent Zemeckis collaborator Steve Starkey
welcomes any and all comparisons to last summer's breakout mystery
hit ``The Sixth Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Sixth Sense'' didn't tell audiences the significance
of Haley Joel Osment's penchant for seeing dead people. Moviegoers
had to discover it for themselves, a fact that helped fuel the
film's enormous box-office success. The marketing folks at
DreamWorks have already tipped Zemeckis' hand with their campaign
for ``What Lies Beneath.'' Not that the director is complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we gave nothing away, we would run the risk of it looking
like Harrison and Michelle were in some domestic movie,'' Zemeckis
says of the trailer, which he calls a ``beautiful piece of
marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't look boring. The trailer has to deliver some of the
movie's promise. Good God, the film is going to be opening in 2,400
theaters or something like that. (Actually, it's closer to 2,700.)
That's a lot of people who are going to have to go see the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   The trailer, Zemeckis adds, is the least of his worries when it
comes to audience expectations. What really bothers Zemeckis is
what lies beneath moviegoers' collective consciousness _ 100 years
of cinema.
</P>
<P>
   ``Audiences today are aware of the conventions of the genre
quite simply because they've seen so many of these movies,''
Zemeckis says. ``They're savvy. So what works best is to
acknowledge the past, put in little winks and nods, and then
contribute what you have to say. And hopefully you can somehow stay
ahead of what the audience is thinking because they're usually 20
minutes ahead of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone familiar (and probably some with only a passing
acquaintance) with Hitchcock's body of work will know what Zemeckis
is thinking while watching ``What Lies Beneath.'' The film moves
from ``Rear Window'' to ``Vertigo'' to ``Psycho'' _ with plenty of
``Suspicion'' thrown in _ before calling it a day with a ``Fatal
Attraction.'' Composer Alan Silvestri's score apes Bernard
Herrmann's work with Hitchcock, making the homage complete.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Zemeckis brings his own trademark blend of
storytelling and special effects into the mix, but with all the
``winks and nods,'' it's difficult sometimes to hear what Zemeckis
has to say, particularly over Silvestri's jolting musical cues.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's OK,'' Zemeckis says. ``I consider it standing on the
shoulders of giants. Hitchcock wrote the language of this genre.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford, who has said on many occasions that he doesn't like
watching old movies, respectfully disagrees with his director.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never scared by Hitchcock; I never believed his
characters that much,'' Ford says. ``What's scary about this movie
is the reality of the characters and the complexity of their
relationship. And that kind of maturity is refreshing in a climate
where most scary stories involve long knives and ladies that take
showers.''
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer didn't have to take any showers in the movie, but she
does spend an inordinate amount of time in water, which led to some
serious skin wrinkling and occasional bouts of claustrophobia. (``I
certainly was plenty clean for a few days there,'' she jokes.)
</P>
<P>
   The actress appreciates film history a bit more than her
co-star, citing vampire movies, Hitchcock's ``The Birds'' and the
1956 demonic kid flick ``The Bad Seed'' as her early favorites of
the thriller genre.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never made one of these primarily because they stopped
making them for a long time,'' Pfeiffer says. ``The thriller genre
turned into slasher movies. And I'm just not into gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither is Zemeckis, who shot ``What Lies Beneath'' during a
break from making ``Castaway,'' the Tom Hanks survivor movie set
for release this December. (Hanks needed the hiatus to add a beard
and shed some weight.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The really twisted psychological aspects of the genre are
what's most fun,'' Zemeckis says. ``The less you show, the spookier
it is because you leave it all up to the audience's imagination.
And the audience loves that because you're reaching down into the
primitive part of the brain that loves fear and craves that
adrenaline fix.''
</P>
<P>
   All that fearmongering gave Zemeckis an energy boost himself,
particularly on the heels of working on the serious ``Castaway.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like going from realism to opera,'' Zemeckis says. ``I
love thrillers because they're director-heavy. They're all about
technique and style. It's a genre of film that is all film. It's
like a high-performance car. We don't use them for our practical,
everyday driving, but they're cool to take out every now and
again.'' &QL;

EXPOS ARE IN EXPERT HANDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To the baseball fan(s) in Montreal, he is the gerant. To his
Spanish-speaking players, he is the dirigente. To you, me, and
Lenny Webster, he is the manager.
</P>
<P>
   In all three languages, his authority and stature supercede his
title. Felipe Alou is not just the skipper of the Montreal Expos.
He is the public face of the beleaguered franchise, the man whose
blood, toil, and tears and have flowed through this organization
longer than anyone else in the team's history.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos have been in business for 32 seasons and Felipe Alou
has been a member for 26 of them. He played 19 games for the team
in 1973 and became a coach in 1976. He has been there ever since,
managing 12 years in the minor league system before being elevated
to the head job in 1992 when the brass needed someone to replace
Tom Runnels 37 games into the season.
</P>
<P>
   So that means he is in his eighth full season as the gerant.
That's a long time for anyone to remain in a manager's job in this
turbulent day and age, and it leads us to one inescapable
conclusion: He must know what he's doing.
</P>
<P>
   There are many, in fact, who maintain that there is no gerant,
dirigente, or manager who can touch him and that what he has done
with the Expos during his nearly nine years in charge is just shy
of miraculous. These folks say that the greatest personal
managerial injustice of our time was the 1994 work stoppage,
because that was going to be Felipe's moment. His team was 74-40
when the strike began, and had the postseason begun right then and
there, his Expos would have been the favorites.
</P>
<P>
   No team has suffered more in the wake of that disastrous strike
than the Expos, whose city has turned against them and whose
financial situation has never been the same. How could this
scenario not be frustrating for such a good baseball man?
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to put '94 and 2000 in the same bag,'' he says with a
shrug. ``What can you do? We had a team that, if it wasn't
dismantled in 1994, who would have beaten us in 1995? Instead, we
were in last place the next year with different players.''
</P>
<P>
   The players on that '94 team were good, some of them even on a
par with their manager, which is to say, pretty damn good. For
Felipe Alou, along with Juan Marichal, brother Mateo, Rico Carty,
and, a little later, his brother Jesus, was in the original wave of
Dominican players who have reshaped the landscape of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were always good Dominican players,'' he says, alluding
to such legendary figures as Ventura Escalante, who died in a plane
crash before ever getting a shot at the Bigs.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but the first ones we saw were his group of stars, the
ones who came of age in the late '50s and early '60s. But no one
ever foresaw such a Dominican takeover of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't see that far ahead,'' smiles Alou, who had a
17-year major league career. ``We were just concerned about
ourselves. But I am telling you that talent was there. We won the
Pan-Am Games in Mexico City by defeating the Americans. I will
never forget the score: 10-4.''
</P>
<P>
   Felipe Alou has had a career. He played alongside Willie Mays,
and let's not forget the day San Francisco finished a game with an
All-Alou outfield. He played in a World Series (1962). He hit .300
three times, finishing with a career average of .286. He led the
National League in hits twice and runs once.
</P>
<P>
   But he is proudest of his arm. He signed as a pitcher/outfielder
and he threw the javelin, discus, and hammer in college. He is not
at all shy about saying that he could throw, although he admits
that Vladimir Guerrero's arm is even better.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers the day his winter league manager was fired and he
was asked to take his place because he was the only legit major
leaguer on the team. `` `You're the man,' they said. I said, `Wha?
Me?' '' He was 24 years old.
</P>
<P>
   So that's how it began, this love affair with managing. He has
had ample opportunity to study his craft, having played for, among
others, Bill Rigney, Tom ``Clancy'' Sheehan, Alvin Dark, Bobby
Bragan, Dick Williams, Gene Mauch, Del Crandall, John McNamara, and
Ralph Houk. Repeat: among others.
</P>
<P>
   Bragan made a particular impression on him, and Houk makes two.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were both real good with players,'' he explains. ``I
learned from them that if you're only going to tell a guy half a
truth, don't say anything. I think players appreciate that more
than anything else. And I've learned not to promise anything,
because there's always a boss or two on top of you. You say
something to someone, and two hours later some higher person says
something different.''
</P>
<P>
   Dark and Williams were two more intriguing pieces of managerial
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dark,'' says Felipe, ``was very similar when he was young to
Williams when he was old.''
</P>
<P>
   After 26 years, he most definitely bleeds bleu, blanc, et rouge.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this franchise leaves, I would consider that a setback to
the city of Montreal,'' he says. ``The sad thing is that this is
not something that started last year. No one has been able to stop
this decline that can lead to the loss of the franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   He identifies closely, having married a French-Canadian and
having two children born in the city. He may not speak much French,
but he understands it very well.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd better not say anything in front of me, because I
understand everything,'' he laughs.
</P>
<P>
   He has seen the town rock to the sport he loves, and it
frustrates him that the situation has broken down the way it has.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my 26th year with the franchise,'' he says. ``I've
always kind of wondered why a ballpark was not built. Now it's a
race with the clock. But why wasn't something done 20 years ago? Or
25 years ago?''
</P>
<P>
   His own clock is ticking. He turned 65 in May and it's very
likely that the 1994 team represented his best chance at managing
in a World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't,'' he says, ``I have no complaints. I played in a
World Series. It would only be frustrating to me if I committed a
mistake _ a managerial mistake _ that prevented my team from
getting to the World Series. That would be frustrating. That would
be painful.''
</P>
<P>
   Take this to the savings and loan institution of your choice:
That's a fictional pain he will never have to share. If the Expos
ever again even sniff at a title, it will not be despite this
extraordinary man. It will be because of him.

SNEAD TAKES A VERY SWEET SWING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ There was some milling around at the
first tee when the older gentleman in the sweatshirt sort of took
matters into his own hands and put the peg in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   With a swing that has lost none of its rhythm over the course of
seven decades, he rifled a perfect drive into the bright blue
Scottish sky, though he didn't bother to follow its flight. Truth
is, he couldn't have seen it had he tried. Further truth is, he
knew exactly where it would be, anyway: dead center, because the
swing is still true even if the eyes aren't.
</P>
<P>
   So Sam Snead, 88 and as colorful as ever, simply settled into
the passenger side of a golf cart and, with very little fanfare,
accepted a ride out to prepare for his next shot.
</P>
<P>
   Kids looking for autographs were more concerned with Tiger Woods
sightings, and some of today's professionals were too deep in their
preparation routine as they came down the 18th to pay attention to
the man in the trademark straw hat, but none of that fazed Slammin'
Sammy, who has returned to St. Andrews _ site of this year's
British Open, which begins Thursday _ to pay his respects one last
time to the birthplace of golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy being here and I will always cherish this course for
the rest of my life,'' said Snead, who accepted an invitation to
help usher this course _ and this tournament _ into a new century.
He will take part in a special Past Champions Challenge Wednesday,
with 22 former British Open champions playing a four-hole
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   It is a perfect fit, because beyond the fact that Snead is the
oldest living former champion, his only participation in this
tournament resulted in victory, right here at St. Andrews in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Snead being Snead, his first impression of the
historic layout prompted a most infamous exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came along beside the golf course and it did not look like
it was in very good shape,'' said Snead, recounting a story that
has been altered and embellished throughout the years, though it
has not lost any of its charm. ``I heard that they used sheep to
cut (the grass), so I finally said to a guy sitting beside me,
`What abandoned golf course is that?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Showing off a pretty good Scottish brogue, Snead laughed
heartily when he remembered the man's outrage: ``I will have you
know it is St. Andrews.''
</P>
<P>
   But Snead discounts the legend that he had disdain for the Old
Course.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a whole lot of shot-making to do a good score,'' he
said of his 290 total that was four shots clear of Bobby Locke and
Johnny Bulla. ``But it is a course where every time you play it you
respect it more.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Ben Hogan (who triumphed at Carnoustie in 1953), Snead was
1 for 1 in the British Open, but typical of that era, it was not a
great windfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cost me $2,000 to come over here in '46,'' said Snead. ``I
won the tournament and got $600. They said, `You coming back to
defend?' And I said, `You're kidding.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Many years later, after he won the British Seniors Championship,
Snead received a check for $460. ``Is this my tipping money?'' he
asked. Told that it was indeed his prize money, Snead laughed. ``I
said, `Don't call me, I'll call you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Many years later, and for an enitrely different reason, they did
call and Snead did say yes. Monday, he played two holes going out
(Nos. 1-2) and two coming in (Nos. 17-18), which is what
Wednesday's competition will be. The sweetest swinger the game ever
has known is many years removed from trying to kid himself into
believing he can still play, but he made the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``With my sight, I can't see a ball land 50 yards, so you know I
have no business even hitting the golf ball,'' said Snead.
</P>
<P>
   He just wants to enjoy this moment, show off the golden swing
that even today makes the pros stop and take note, and leave on
good terms with St. Andrews.

`SURVIVOR' THEORY ON NET UNDERSCORES POP PHENOMENON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They're talking about it at water coolers, debating it on
bulletin boards. They're searching for the answer everywhere _
hacking Web sites, scouring computer code, analyzing television
footage. Everyone wants to be the first to know who will emerge
victorious at the end of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   No, we're not talking about the bid for vice president _ Did
someone say election? We're talking about ``Survivor,'' the CBS
reality program (Wednesday at 8 p.m.) that critics originally
dismissed as the end of Western civilization but that is actually
bringing people together to share a common pop cultural obsession.
Who will survive the rats _ both literal and figurative?
</P>
<P>
   There hasn't been this much popular attention to a TV
cliffhanger since the nation wondered who shot J.R. on ``Dallas''
in 1980 or who killed Laura Palmer on ``Twin Peaks'' in 1990. There
is, of course, nothing new about conspiracy theories and pop
culture. But today, there is one difference to the rampant
speculation about ``Survivor'': It's called the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone stood around the water cooler and speculated about
who shot J.R., and it was intense,'' recalls cultural critic Steven
Stark. ``But with the Internet, the water cooler is a heck of a lot
bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   And today, conspiracy theories run deeper, spread more quickly,
and involve more high-tech espionage. Over the weekend, a Canadian
college student claimed to have discovered the winner of the show
by cracking into files supposedly not available to the public on
the CBS ``Survivor'' Web site (see end of story for details). The
student, Corrie Sloot of Ontario, found image files of the 16
contestants; all of the photos were marked with a red X, except
one. He immediately announced his shocking revelation on the
popular fan site, www.survivorsucks.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in North America always open their Christmas presents
before Christmas,'' Sloot said in an interview by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the show has given CBS a nice little Christmas in
July; last week, almost 25 million people watched the top-ranked
show.
</P>
<P>
   Sloot's announcement set off a wave of further speculation that
the discovery was a red herring planted by CBS. Earlier in the
show's run, one of the contestants who had already been kicked off
the show dropped a hint that the winner was Gretchen Cody, a former
Air Force survival instructor. That theory was nixed last week,
when Cody was voted off the show.
</P>
<P>
   Is the Sloot's discovery just another false clue?
</P>
<P>
   ``CBS will neither confirm nor deny any report about the future
results of `Survivor' and instead will continue letting the press
run inaccurate information,'' said Dana McClintock, vice president
of communications.
</P>
<P>
   Is this a brilliant marketing coup or a dumb mistake by some
unwitting Web designer? CBS isn't talking.
</P>
<P>
   But Paul Sims, the Dallas-based programmer who runs
survivorsucks.com, says he doubts CBS is planting false leads.
``It's like this monster that keeps growing based on a kernel of
truth,'' says Sims, whose site received 250,000 hits last week. (In
an ironic note, Monday Sims was asked to shut down another fan site
for another CBS reality show, ``Big Brother,'' by its producers,
despite the fact that his ``Survivor'' site is feeding a media
frenzy.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, computer security experts say such a mistake breaks
the basic rule of Web design. ``It's common knowledge that you
never put anything out on the Web that you don't need to have out
there, especially with something top secret,'' says Weld Pond, a
research scientist at the Cambridge-based computer security firm,
At Stake.
</P>
<P>
   Some enterprising students at MIT weren't convinced that Sloot's
X theory was legit, so they did some sleuthing and discovered
another series of photographs of all 16 contestants on another
section of the Web site; all 16 were shown with a red X. The kids
at MIT didn't really care about the show until the rumors emerged
about the Web site: ``That kind of thing excites people on this
campus,'' said Satwik Seshasai, chairman of MIT's student newspaper
and one of the students who sought to disprove the rumor.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, you can't buy the kind of publicity ``Survivor'' is
generating. ``If you had 15 minutes to spend, would you prefer
listening to the drab packaged rhetoric of both Gore (and) Bush or
getting a chance to see who's going to win (a million) bucks?''
asks Democratic political consultant Michael Goldman, who expresses
disdain for ``Survivor'' but admits he will probably watch the
final show. ``What do you get with Bush and Gore? It's just blah,
you know?'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In the '70s, we had the Watergate trials, in the '80s we had
``Dallas,'' and now we have a desert isle. And there are some who
say that this particular pop cultural phenomenon isn't necessarily
a bad thing since it brings together a fragmented, divided nation.
``Television used to be a social glue, and that has changed in the
late 20th century,'' says Robert Thompson, professor of film and
television at Syracuse University. ``This show, and `Who Wants to
Be a Millionaire,' remind me of the '50s, because everyone can sit
around and watch it, young, old, rich, and poor.''
</P>
<P>
   And the show itself, Thompson points out, is quite clean-cut,
despite its initial promise of all the fun that comes with scantily
clad strangers marooned in the tropics. But that innocence could
change: After the show debuted in Sweden, some particants contended
that other contestants smuggled alcohol and tobacco onto the
island, allegedly with the help of the producers. And some fans of
the show think CBS is sure to cook up something fishy in upcoming
episodes. Could it be that there is yet another conspiracy brewing?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SPOILER: Read no further if you don't want to know Sloot's
theory of the alleged winner, however dubious. He suggests that the
victor is Gervase Peterson, a youth basketball coach
distinguishable as the only contestant on the island who can't
swim.

1976 CASE A FACTOR IN CHARGES BROUGHT OVER SEX PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The legal wrangling over whether the a district attorney can
prosecute a Manhattan executive for assault for spanking a woman at
a secret sadomasochistic party centers on a decades-old
Massachusetts case involving two lovers, a riding crop, and their
self-styled torture chamber.
</P>
<P>
   It's been nearly a quarter of a century since a police
department has used the so-called Appleby assault statute _ listed
under Massachusetts General Law's chapter on ``Crimes against
Chastity, Morality, Decency and Good Order'' _ to charge someone
involved in consensual, rough-sex play.
</P>
<P>
   But S&AMP;M practitioners worry that last week's charges signal that
they'll have to burrow further underground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wake-up call,'' said John Warren, 57, who founded
Boston Dungeon Society in 1994. ``Most people know about Appleby,
but they never thought it would be applied. Now it's being applied
and it has scared people.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1976 Kenneth Appleby, a 27-year-old pawnbroker, was sentenced
to eight to 10 years in prison for beating his partner, Steven
Cromer, with a riding crop.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Appleby testified that Cromer demanded
beatings, and he complied. The two said they set up a ``torture
chamber'' in his tar-paper shack in West Springfield, Mass.,
complete with a stretching rack, leg irons, and other ``toys.''
</P>
<P>
   Appleby said the relationship was consensual, but Cromer told
the jury he consented because he feared Appleby.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate, earlier trial, Appleby was accused of breaking
his lover's kneecaps with a baseball bat. He was acquitted because
Cromer testified that he had fallen.
</P>
<P>
   The second trial set the case law; the conviction was considered
clear-cut because of Cromer's testimony. But an Attleboro, Mass.
case involving the New York executive strikes a different chord.
Those familiar with it say the alleged victim wanted to be spanked.
</P>
<P>
   George Nassar, the lawyer who represented Appleby in the earlier
trial, said he believes that in Massachusetts a person could be
convicted of assault, even if the victim asked for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge gave Appleby eight to 10 years in prison for what
they called a glancing blow on the shoulder with a riding crop,''
Nassar said. ``The case was more like a Salem witch trial.''
</P>
<P>
   But the law has never been tested at the appellate level.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point you just have somebody's opinion,'' said Robert
Sheketoff, a Boston attorney specializing in criminal law.
</P>
<P>
   That means the case could go either way. And, already, those who
fear that a conviction in the Attleboro case will threaten their
lifestyle have banded together to raise a defense fund for Stefany
Reed, the Manhattan woman charged with assault and battery, and New
Hampshire resident Benjamin Davis, the S&AMP;M party host who faces a
list of charges, including ``exhibiting or lending articles for
self-abuse,'' and ``keeping a house of ill fame for lewdness.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis and Reed were charged July 8 after Attleboro police
stumbled upon the party in a downtown warehouse while investigating
an unrelated theft.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Ferris, a part-time prosecutor handling the case, did not
return calls.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, at a hastily called meeting in a Concord,
Mass. storefront _ the headquarters for Boston Dungeon Society _
about 30 S&AMP;M participants gathered to talk about their options.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked, `Do I have to stop playing?' '' Warren said.
``They're worried that police are going to go into their bedrooms.
They see themselves as law-abiding citizens. But now they're
worried.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is getting attention from various groups concerned
about the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Wright, policy director for the Washington, D.C.-based
National Coalition for Sexual Freedom, said police have no more
right to charge sadomasochists than they do boxers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as you agree to the rules of the game, it's not
considered assault when boxers get into the ring,'' Wright said.
``In boxing you are hitting someone's face, which causes harm. In
S/M you just don't do that. Everything we do is designed to cause
pleasure. I doubt that boxers are getting much pleasure.''

A CLEARHEADED LOOK AT THE STORK CLUB'S GLORY DAYS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
STORK CLUB 
America's Most Famous Nightspot and the Lost World of Cafe Society 
By Ralph Blumenthal 
Little, Brown, 296 pp., illustrated, $25.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Ralph Blumenthal's ``Stork Club,'' a marvelous evocation of
New York night life from the Depression through the mid-'60s, you
can practically smell the secondhand smoke from Walter Winchell's
cigarette and hear the tinkle of ice in Ernest Hemingway's scotch
and water.
</P>
<P>
   The Stork Club, under the savvy management of Oklahoma-born
Sherman Billingsley, became a worldwide symbol of America's cafe
society. At various times, the duke and duchess of Windsor sat near
Alfred Hitchcock while he discussed ``The Wrong Man'' with Henry
Fonda. Congressman John F. Kennedy smiled over drinks with the
vivacious Jacqueline Bouvier not far from where FBI chief J. Edgar
Hoover was meeting and greeting with his ominipresent pal Clyde
Tolson. Joltin' Joe and Jock Whitney and Bogie and Bacall. Gene
Tunney and Hank Greenberg and Lana Turner. In short, a
name-droppers' paradise suitable for an Al Hirschfeld drawing.
</P>
<P>
   While Billingsley's reputation rests on his convivial
countenance as the club's official greeter, this book's value is in
recounting Billingsley's backdoor dealings, and sometimes double
dealings, with politicians and gangsters.
</P>
<P>
   There are also the matters of race and class. It was no
coincidence that most of the famous smiling out from the publicity
photographs were white and wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most highly publicized incidents in the club's
history, international star Josephine Baker waited for her dinner
for more than an hour. When it didn't arrive, she called her
lawyer, Walter White, executive secretary for the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   The club weakly claimed she ordered a filet mignon that wasn't
on the menu and quickly tried to make amends. But it was too late.
NAACP counsel Thurgood Marshall advised her to picket the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not intend to take such treatment quietly, '' Baker told
the New York Post. ``I have no intention of suffering deliberate
humiliation without striking back.''
</P>
<P>
   Longtime Stork Club habitue Hoover, after receiving a request
from the NAACP to investigate the matter, responded with the
following scribble: ``No answer required. I don't consider this any
of my business.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the picket line outside the Stork Club included cast
members from ``Guys and Dolls'' and ``South Pacific'' along with
Ruth James, Duke Ellington's sister. Eventually, Sugar Ray Robinson
and other Billingsley pals came to his defense, and excuses were
made that everyone must wait for service. But the fact remains that
most of the black faces at the Stork Club were congregated in the
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   And these incidents are precisely what makes Blumenthal's book
so superior to ``Welcome to the Stork Club,'' a purported Sherman
Billingsley memoir penned by former maitre d' Mearl L. Allen,
published in 1980. While Blumenthal is clearly enchanted with the
comings and goings at the club _ as a social history of the years
from Prohibition through the Vietnam War _ he's not a romantic.
He's not trying to create a nostalgic view of Billingsley's reign
but a clearheaded, concise account of how power among organized
crime, Hollywood celebrities, New York politicians, and the wealthy
came together over an oversize black-and-white ashtray and a couple
of martinis.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, Blumenthal notes, a Philadelphia Inquirer columnist
wrote what amounted to the Stork Club's obituary: ``The E. 53rd St.
club is now less like a debutante than a movie star of the 1930s
who once was aloof but now is eager to chat with anyone who
recognizes her. She has aged but not gracefully.''

IT'S NOT ABOUT THE BIKE 
My Journey Back to Life 
By Lance Armstrong with Sally Jenkins 
Putname, 288 pp., $24.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bicycle is a grand metaphor for life. It is freedom but also
control. It is a parent who has held a child in arm's-length safety
for a young lifetime letting go _ go! _ and pushing the precious
human cargo free, without benefit of training wheels. The young
rider is under her own power, wobbling at first, now steady, the
tears gone, the smile triumphant. It is all there, the bond between
parent and child spinning into trust on a warm summer's day.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Armstrong, the Texan who this week is trying to repeat
last year's victory in the Tour de France, rides this metaphor for
all it is worth in his remarkable autobiography. His life has been
a ride over countless mountain ranges, figurative and literal.
Winning the Tour de France, with its many 100-mile-plus days and
alpine passages, was the easy part, to hear Armstrong tell it.
</P>
<P>
   As the title of Armstrong's book says, ``It's Not About the
Bike.'' Armstrong, as even many casual sports fans know by now, was
a brash up-and-coming US star of the European racing circuit when
he discovered in 1996 that he had testicular cancer. For months, he
ignored the pain, thinking it was the price of pounding in the
saddle. Then the pain transformed itself into terror; a testicle
grew three times its normal size and he began coughing up blood.
Finally, he went to his doctor. Armstrong's failure to deal earlier
with the symptoms of this rare form of cancer enabled the disease
to speed through his body and affect his brain, ultimately
requiring a horrific combination of brain surgery and chemotherapy.
By the end of his treatment, Armstrong was so weak he couldn't ride
his bike for months. Any thought that he could participate in a
bike race _ or even a neighborhood jaunt _ seemed far-fetched.
</P>
<P>
   As Armstrong knows well, relatively few Americans would be
interested in his story if it were merely a tale of how he won the
Tour de France. It has been nearly a century since bicycle racing
was the most popular sport in the United States. While the
three-week race through France is one of the world's most-watched
sporting spectacles, there is nothing remotely comparable to it in
this country, and most mainstream media here give bicycle racing
short shrift. It has taken a human story of tragedy and triumph to
give the sport the attention it deserves in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong and his skilled co-author, sports journalist Sally
Jenkins, put this elegantly in perspective. ``I left my house on
October 2, 1996, as one person and came home another,'' Armstrong
writes.
</P>
<P>
   That was cancer day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that cancer was the best thing that ever happened
to me,'' Armstrong writes. ``I don't know why I got the illness,
but it did wonders for me, and I wouldn't want to walk away from
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was just a scrawny 7-year-old when he got his first
``serious'' bike, an ugly brown Schwinn Mag Scrambler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why does a kid love a bike?'' Armstrong writes. ``It's
liberation and independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Independence turned out to be a valuable commodity. Armstrong
never met his biological father, whom he refers to acidly as the
``DNA donor'' and ``my so-called father.'' He is similarly
disparaging about the man who adopted him and married and divorced
his mother. He says his own name, Armstrong, means nothing to him.
A hero of the book is Lance's mother, who was 17 years old when
Lance was born and raised him mostly as a single mother.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's story of his treatment and recovery in Indianapolis
is the heart of the book. Doctors and nurses are heroes. His former
French racing team, which tried to renegotiate Armstrong's contract
after learning of his cancer, is the villain. Shortly after being
declared cancer-free, Lance got married; his wife, Kristin,
eventually went through a painful but successful process of
in-vitro fertilization to have a child.
</P>
<P>
   In unexpected ways, the cancer treatment helped Armstrong win
the Tour de France as a rider for the team sponsored by the US
Postal Service. The treatment led to a dramatic weight loss and
reshaped Armstrong's muscular structure, making it easier for him
to climb the highest mountains. He was forced to make his technique
more efficient, pedaling in an easier gear at a higher speed. By
the time Armstrong recovered from his cancer treatment, he was like
the kid on a new bike again, craving the freedom. That is the
inspiration of this book, to feel again the joy of the ride, and of
life itself.

LOVE WAS HERE AND NOW IT'S GONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Diana Ross must be flipping her weave.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of dismal ticket sales and half-empty venues, the
plug was finally pulled last week on the whole sputtering mess that
was the ``Return to Love'' tour starring Diana Ross and Those Two
Women Who Were Supremes But Weren't The Supremes.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't supposed to be like this.
</P>
<P>
   Back in April, when Ross announced that she would be launching a
30-city summer tour with Scherrie Payne and Lynda Laurence, she
tried to pitch the concerts as something a rung or two below a
reunion, since Ross, who left the group in 1969, had never sung a
single note with either Payne or Laurence. Said Ross at the time,
``I decided to do this again for the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, the fans wanted nothing to do with it, and now Ross is at
a loss, wondering where did our love go. The show couldn't even
sell out in Michigan, where three Detroit high school chums first
joined their voices and became the Supremes more than 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement last week, Ross said she was ``severely
disappointed'' with the cancellation of the tour's remaining dates.
``I promised our fans that I would be there for them. . . . I would
sing the same if there were 10 people in the audience or 10,000. I
love the music and the fans, and I will find a way to reconnect
with them as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ross may well mean that. But if she were so interested in
connecting with her fans, she would have given them what they've
been wanting for 30 years _ a real Supremes reunion with cofounder
Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong, who replaced original Supreme
Florence Ballard in 1967. More than just icons, they've been the
evergreen template for every girlgroup since _ from the Emotions to
TLC to Destiny's Child.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I'm sure Payne and Laurence are very nice and talented
women, two of the eight who, between 1959 and 1977, donned the
uniform of killer pumps, fancy dresses, and heavy eyeliner as the
Supremes. But they are not the Supremes most of us grew up with,
not the women who, along with Ross, first gave life to such
Holland-Dozier-Holland gems as ``Stop! In the Name of Love,''
``Love is Like an Itching in My Heart,'' and ``Baby Love.'' Given
that she was joining Payne and Laurence, Ross said, ``I never even
considered it a reunion tour'' _ and that was fine because neither
did we.
</P>
<P>
   For while Ross may be the voice of the Supremes, Wilson is its
heart and soul. It was Wilson who kept the group going after Ross's
departure, and with Jean Terrell taking over lead-singing duties,
the Supremes enjoyed such hits as ``Up the Ladder to the Roof,''
``Stoned Love,'' ``Everybody's Got the Right to Love,'' ``Floy
Joy,'' and ``Nathan Jones.'' The Supremes have existed without
Ross, but never, in an appreciable way, without Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Ross assumed that she alone was worth the price of
admission, and believed it didn't really matter who cooed those
``oooohs,'' ``think it overs,'' and ``baby, babys'' next to her.
But ultimately, it mattered mightily when the top ticket price was
a stunning $250 to see what amounted to Ross and a couple of backup
singers.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? If this had truly been a Diana Ross and the Supremes
reunion, instead of ``Suprememania'' starring Diana Ross, folks
might have been willing to pay those prices, instead of stamping
the ``Return to Love'' tour ``return to sender.'' It would have
been a thrill to see Ross, Wilson, and Birdsong together again,
finally breathing life into the long-unfulfilled promise of their
hit ``Someday We'll Be Together.''
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, I saw Ross in concert, and for all her diva
overkill, there was something electric about hearing her sing
classic tunes from the Supremes' 1960s heyday. How couldn't there
be? Songs like ``You Can't Hurry Love,'' ``Back in My Arms Again,''
``The Happening,'' and ``Love Child'' are like old friends whose
presence never fails to bring joy. Many of us were warbling these
songs into hairbrush microphones before we even knew what love or
heartbreak were, and can't recall a time when they weren't a part
of our lives.
</P>
<P>
   But alas, Ross and Wilson, who with Ballard (she died in 1976)
first formed the group as teenagers living in Detroit's Brewster
projects, couldn't come to terms on money. Wilson said she was
``insulted'' by a $3 million offer out of an overall talent budget
of $15 to $20 million. (Birdsong must have been insulted three
times over _ she was offered less than $1 million.)
</P>
<P>
   Ross claimed that she wished Wilson could have joined the tour,
but added, ``When I decided to do the tour, I thought the music was
more important than the individuals.'' Perhaps. But the true
Supremes have always been more than just the hired help. Without
them, the tour's been aborted, and somewhere out there, Mary, Cindy
_ and yes, Florence, too _ are having the last laugh.
</P>
<P>
   All those years ago, Ross once sang ``You Can't Hurry Love'';
now, perhaps, she understands that, as far as her fans are
concerned, you can't take it for granted either.

ART TECHNOLOGY GROUP IS PROVING IT PAYS TO STAY FLEXIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a lot to be said for flexibility when you know your
world will change every six months but don't have a clue exactly
what the future will demand.
</P>
<P>
   That idea has been rumbling around one corner of the Internet
stock market this month. Debate surrounding it may say a lot about
what works in the competition for business customers on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The big winner of the moment: Art Technology Group Inc. of
Cambridge, Mass., whose stock has jumped by more than 25 percent in
less than two weeks and set an all-time high six days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Art Technology Group counts itself among a handful of software
companies that can transform electronic commerce Web sites from
another form of mass marketing to vehicles for personalized
connections with customers.
</P>
<P>
   As a customer you may never notice the software at work. It can
recognize you upon entering a Web site, recall your past activities
there, react to what you are doing at that moment, figure out what
items might be cross-sold to you, and keep in contact later through
e-mail promotions and other communications. All that is known as
``closing the loop'' in e-commerce parlance, helping a company
forge and hold onto relationships with customers.
</P>
<P>
   Practically every commercial site on the Internet uses the kinds
of software products sold by these companies or will soon. In the
business-to-business Internet world, that's a pretty good growth
story.
</P>
<P>
   The rumbles were felt two weeks ago when American Airlines hired
Art Technology Group to work on its Web site, replacing competitor
and industry leader Broadvision Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The dollars involved were never disclosed and almost beside the
point. The deal was news because it seemed to back up a strategy
the smaller Art Technology Group has pursued from its earliest
days.
</P>
<P>
   Though Broadvision has been serving its customers longer and
offered high-quality software, it sells products that are more
difficult to intregrate with other computer systems inside a
company and even other, related customer software. Broadvision
became an early star in its world on the quality of its packaged
application software, or ``packaged apps,'' and stands above its
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Art Technology Group built its Dynamo product line using Java
software that could mesh easily with other types of computer
systems and adapt with relative ease to new situations that
required additional software or other changes.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines was just one of hundreds of corporate clients
at Broadvision. But it was a flagship relationship Broadvision had
often promoted itself, involving the operation of a complex and
active Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the American Airlines win is a watershed kind of thing
but it's not signficant in and of itself,'' said Jeet Singh, the
chief execuitve of Art Technology Group. ``What the world is
watching is the decision-making that went into it and a much more
significant change in thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly investors were wondering if there might be at least some
truth to that.
</P>
<P>
   Broadvision shares lost about a third of their value within four
days of the American Airlines announcement. Bad news came in a
batch: the next day Broadvision said it wouldn't supply software to
Walmart.com while Art Technology Group played up the fact that an
early version of Kmart Corp.'s BlueLight.com would use its Dynamo
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is rapidly moving to one of open architecture,''
said analyst Steven Frankel of Adams, Harkness &AMP; Hill in Boston. It
would be easy to declare the recent advances of Art Technology
Group as evidence that open architecture, software and systems that
make possible a maximum amount of computer interaction, will win
out in business-to-business Internet competition.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations, after all, have the technical skills and
complicated circumstances that seem to demand it.
</P>
<P>
   But that's too simple, said analyst David Smith of Loomis Sayles
&AMP; Co. He said Art Technology Group would not be racking up
impressive client scores without a related business strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Art Technology Group has spent serious time and money
to train hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people at other consulting
companies who are paid by Web-site operators to select and install
software systems.
</P>
<P>
   Without that growing army, Smith said, there would be no
commercial movement to open systems. And even today, it's not
entirely clear who or what will win.
</P>
<P>
   The one sure thing: It's nearly impossible to stay on top for
long without a serious challenge. Just like their customers, Art
Technology Group and competitors will have to deal with a
competitive world that demands endless change.

JENNINGS ONE OF A KIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ It doesn't help that Gabe Jennings shares a
Jan. 25 birthday with Steve Prefontaine, who was America's greatest
distance runner when he died in a car crash in 1975 at the age of
24. But even without that eerie coincidence the comparisons still
would be made: the shaggy hair, the nonconformity, the guts with
which he runs, the potential for greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't get carried away, warns Vin Lananna, his coach at
Stanford, who is beginning to find the topic a bit tiresome. ``Gabe
Jennings is Gabe Jennings,'' he said this week, ``and I'm not sure
there are others like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings, who just six weeks ago claimed the outdoor NCAA 1,500
meter crown as a junior, Sunday became the first collegiate runner
since Jim Ryun in 1968 to win at 1,500 meters in the US Olympic
Trials when he ran it in 3 minutes 35.90 seconds, the fastest time
by an American this year.
</P>
<P>
   As he ran, dozens of friends and family members in the bleachers
coming off the backstretch provided the external accompaniment,
pounding drums meant to activate the internal beat Jennings, a
music major and drum player at Stanford, must feel to perform his
best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our heart's always pumping and our lungs are always heaving,''
said Jennings in an explanation typical of his unconventionality.
``It's when you're aware of it that the magic can happen. When I'm
not in that zone, I have a bad race; usually I don't hear rhythms
and if I do they're not in synch or the melodies I hear are
dissonant.''
</P>
<P>
   Known to climb into the stands at Stanford after finishing his
race to drum for the rest of the runners, Jennings has been heeding
his own beat since childhood, spent in a remote California town
called Forks of Salmon. There, his family used a battery to
generate electricity when they needed it, used firewood for heat,
ate straight out of their garden, and maintained their own water
line. ``It was definitely a rugged lifestyle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But still not as primitive as the mythmakers would have it. ``We
actually did have plumbing,'' said Jennings, despite plentiful
reports to the contrary. ``I think it's funny. People razz me about
it, raised by the coyotes.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was 13, he moved with his parents and sister to Madison,
Wis., so his father, Jim, could study ancient philosophy at the
University of Wisconsin. It was at Madison East High School that
Jennings discovered running, winning nine state titles, before
moving on to Stanford, where his teammates include Jonathon Riley
of Brookline, Mass., Andy Powell of North Easton, Mass., and
Michael Stember, who finished second to Jennings at the NCAAs and
third here.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one really knows what sort of plane Gabe exists on except
that it works for him,'' said Stember. ``We all do our best to turn
it into positive energy for the team. Sometimes that's a bit
difficult, but because he is entertaining to everybody it often
gets turned into a really fun show to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Lananna, for whom Jennings this spring helped win Stanford's
first NCAA championship in 66 years, said he sees his role as
providing perspective. ``I try to make sure (race) decisions are
made with his head, and not just gut or emotion,'' he explained,
while not trying to curb Jennings's instincts to run from heart,
often making the kind of early move he did here just 600 meters
into the race. ``With Gabe, his strength is his passion and the
excitement in everything he does.''
</P>
<P>
   The young man in the smock-like shirt and soft clogs who fed off
cosmic energy as ``the moon kept getting fuller and the air kept
getting fresher'' with the biggest race of his life approaching;
who said he knew he would win when he awoke from his afternoon
visualization session to notice that his foot was tapping,
nonetheless refuses to classify himself as a free spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to overthink my image or my lifestyle and just act
it, or be it,'' he said. ``My motto is to really live in the
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   That moment will soon be on the Olympic stage. There is no fear
in Jennings's deep brown eyes when he says: ``I'm just 21 years old
now, but I'm ready to start racing the big guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken, just once, like a typical runner.

CITIZEN COORS 
By Dan Baum. Morrow. 357 pp. Illustrated. $27. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the more odious forms of TV miniseries and motion
pictures is the patchwork historical drama, in which each character
serves in the most contrived way to represent an important facet of
the times being dramatized.
</P>
<P>
   One might want to raise the same complaint about Dan Baum's
second book, ``Citizen Coors,'' except that apparently it all
actually happened that way. The saga of the Colorado brewing family
is intertwined with thread after thread of American history:
Western expansion, rugged individualism, Prohibition, patriotic
contributions in wartime, the rise and fall of unions, concern for
the environment, the triumph of consumerism over quality, the rise
of the conservative movement.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the Coors family is just as rich on a more personal
level, filled as it is with humble beginnings and mountains of
money, high principle and stunning hypocrisy, charity and
vindictiveness, even murder and suicide. It is an epic from any
angle, and despite the flaws in his rendering of it, Baum deserves
high credit for obeying the first rule of biography: Find a story
worth telling.
</P>
<P>
   Adolph Coors learned brewing in his native Germany, but when his
parents died and the Kaiser went to war, Coors stowed away to
America in 1868. He eventually paid his fare, but it is instructive
that for decades, that free passage remained a blot on the family's
sense of its heritage, unfit for discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Coors eventually made his way to the Colorado frontier,
determined to stand out. He would make beer, and he would make the
best by controlling as much of the process as he could. The
economic term for that is vertical integration, but more plainly,
it was all about control. More than anything, Adolph Coors insisted
on being in charge.
</P>
<P>
   In those early days, his determination brought great prosperity.
But succeeding generations hewed unquestioningly to Adolph's way,
and as the world changed, this same trait became obstinacy; even
when a boycott motivated by their hiring practices threatened to
bring them down, they still held the attitude that no one could
dictate how they would run their brewery.
</P>
<P>
   Baum focuses on the third generation, beginning in the 1930s,
led by William and Joseph Coors. Of the two, Bill gets the more
favorable rendering _ which may be because he agreed to talk to
Baum, albeit sparingly and grudgingly, and Joe didn't.
</P>
<P>
   That is a pitfall evident throughout the book: Those who gave
interviews come off largely as reasonable people toiling in
unreasonable circumstances, and those who gave the most interviews
look the best. There were many more interviews given outside the
family than within, and the family often gets the worse side of
events.
</P>
<P>
   This is never more true than in Baum's central tableau, the
company's endlessly fitful adjustment to the century of marketing.
For years, the family simply didn't have an advertising department,
just as it had no lawyers or accountants, or business plan. Its
first ad director had a PhD in art history. That he had few
qualifications for the job was unimportant; the family didn't
really want him to do anything.
</P>
<P>
   The first real ad man, John Nichols, came aboard in 1978, brash
and immodest. In Baum's telling, he is a shining knight, tilting at
the family's preposterous, hidebound ways, overflowing with great
ideas that Bill and Joe would sneer at. In an appendix, Baum gives
an accounting of his interviews (there were about 225 in all):
Nichols gave nine, more than anyone else, and more than all Coors
family members combined.
</P>
<P>
   There's another possible reason that Joe especially is portrayed
unflatteringly. He owes much of his prominence to his politics,
which are decidedly conservative. There was a time when he would
put John Birch Society pamphlets in his workers' paychecks, and he
is the founding patron of the Heritage Foundation, which helped
nurse the rebirth of the conservative movement in America. Joe was
on a first-name basis with Ronald Reagan long before that darling
of the right was a candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   Baum's own agenda is well to the left; it is fair to say that
conservatives reading ``Citizen Coors'' will find more evidence for
their belief that the media have a liberal bias. For example, one
of Baum's tenets is that unions are good and employers who don't
want them are evil. Another is that profit should be not just the
highest goal of business, but the only proper one _ that political
and moral principles have no place in the marketplace. The latter
may well be true (the Coorses certainly took numerous beatings
because of their politics), but one is left to wonder if companies
devoted to more acceptable causes would be subject to the same
opprobrium.
</P>
<P>
   An irony is that the Coorses, and Bill particularly, were green
long before green was groovy. Partly because he cringed at the
sight of Coors cans discarded at the roadside, he suggested to the
US Brewers Association in 1960 _ 1960! _ that aluminum cans be
recycled. Led by Anheuser-Busch, the industry rejected the idea,
saying consumers wouldn't go for it. Ten years later, 85 percent of
Coors cans were being turned in for cash, foreshadowing the
nickel-back campaigns that many states require today.
</P>
<P>
   But coupled with that irony is the sort of startling
crosscurrent that makes the Coorses so complicated, and thoroughly
human. They revered Clear Creek, whose waters had lured Adolph to
Golden in 1873. But in 1981, when Bill and Joe learned they had
been releasing solvents into the groundwater, they chose not to
report the spills as required by federal law. They envisioned large
fines, the intrusion of federal officials (which offended their
conservative sensibilities), the possibility of having to shut down
temporarily, and the certainty of public pillorying. So they
covered it up. They had their principles, but this time, business
was business.
</P>
<P>
   At other times, Joe and Bill were just downright reprehensible,
such as when they spent a substantial sum of money on drugs and
undercover agents to try _ unsuccessfully _ to prove certain of
their employees were dealing. Their suspicions about their workers
knew no bounds; once during a speech to them, Bill proclaimed the
existence of a communist cell among them. The year was 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Coorses had flaws, so does the author. In addition
to the infusion of his own politics and values, Baum crosses into
personal mockery, such as when he describes Jeff Coors, one of many
born-again fundamentalists in the family, as a ``prissy Christian''
when he objects to the use of Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, as a
Coors huckster. That's a pretty harsh description of someone acting
on his deepest beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Baum's narrative flows smoothly and he cleverly blends the
personal and political, but his writing is unexceptional.
Repeatedly, he ascribes motives to actions for the sake of
continuity, such as when he says, ``In an expansive mood after his
wedding, Bill sat down with the leadership of Local 366 and worked
out a pension agreement.'' He sometimes engenders confusion by not
following a strict chronology; that's not the only way to tell a
story, but Baum should have taken more care when jumping around.
</P>
<P>
   Considering its subjects, the book's shortcomings are oddly
appropriate. They do stain its achievements, but don't negate them.
It is that way with the Coorses, too. They have erred, sometimes
motivated by principle, sometimes by venality. But they've also
created something lasting, from nothing. They have been more than
witnesses to American history; they have helped write the book.

FEMALE FANS SAY THEY'RE IN IT FOR THE CATHARSIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Picture the typical rap-metal or hardcore rock fan and you're
likely to come up with a variation on this theme: young,
pugnacious, and male, hurling his shirtless frame to gargantuan
beats in unison with hordes of oafish frat boys, radical skate
kids, and raging teens.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the brief ascent of the riot grrrl movement in the
cultural consciousness last decade, hard, angry music is largely
perceived as a testosterone-saturated affair, for performers and
fans alike. Especially now, with misogyny a prominent theme among
chart-topping artists such as Eminem, Limp Bizkit, and Kid Rock,
the genre seems skewed toward a particularly vicious sort of
masculinity.
</P>
<P>
   That's why it's startling to see the growing ranks of female
fans of hardcore music. Contrary to popular opinion, not every
adolescent heart is aflutter for the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync.
Girls from the suburbs and girls from the city, girls who live in
tiny hamlets overseas and in Midwestern trailer parks, are
dedicated followers of the new crop of coarse, venomous rockers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be a growing passion among females for this
type of music,'' says Amy Doyle, director of music programming for
MTV. ``We think that `TRL' (`Total Request Live'), our audience
empowerment show, may be contributing. The girls started out
calling in for the pop groups, while the males were voting for Limp
Bizkit and Kid Rock. They ended up being exposed to music they
might not have sought out. Females are buying it in droves now. It
seems very clear that when Eminem is selling over 5 million CDs in
six weeks, it's not just males buying it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're taking all their hate inside, all that's
happened, and releasing it in the best way,'' says 16-year-old
Kelly O'Connell of Boston, who counts among her favorite musicians
Slipknot, Korn, Marilyn Manson, and Insane Clown Posse. ``Take
Slipknot's `Wait and Bleed,' '' says O'Connell. ``With the words, I
feel the hate rise up in me, and I'm putting the hate out by
listening to it. When I get in a fight with my mom, I'll turn on a
CD and listen to all the weird stuff they sing about, and it calms
me down. Slow music doesn't help me, it makes me madder.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Not just a guy thing &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Historically, pummeling death-metal drums, shrieking feedback,
and horror-show samples _ Slipknot's stock in trade _ haven't held
much appeal for young females. Neither has Limp Bizkit's brand of
sledgehammer misogyny, though frontman Fred Durst and company are
dealing in essentially the same currency heavy-metal gods and
rappers have for years. The difference is that young women are
beginning to embrace it with open arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the women he knew treated him badly,'' says Stephanie
Finelli, 16, who lives in Manchester, Conn., of Durst-penned tunes
such as ``Stuck.'' In the song _ which Durst often dedicates in
concert ``to all the girls'' _ he sings ``Psycho female blowin' up
the phone line/You need to tighten that screw, it's been loose for
a long time/You make a dash for my cash/it's your (expletive) that
I'm blasting. . . . Why, why, why you gotta dig in my business you
(expletive) whore?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Limp Bizkit,'' Finelli says. ``The beat really appeals
to me. I occasionally listen to the words. But I don't take it
personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course Durst is a veritable Osmond Brother when compared with
Eminem, whose unbridled venom toward women, gays, most of his
colleagues in music, his wife, and his mother sets a new standard
for violent and hateful lyrics. As the best-selling pop artist in
the country, Eminem is a lightning rod for debate about issues
ranging from censorship and artistic accountability to the decline
of polite society and American youth's taste for mean-spirited
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   For Jenny Hawkins, Eminem represents something much simpler.
``My parents hate rap. Sometimes I play my Eminem records to rebel
against them when I feel angry,'' says 15-year-old Hawkins, echoing
a form of teenage insurrection as old as rock itself. Hawkins lives
in the small English village of Huntley (we met in an Eminem chat
room and conversed via e-mail); she doesn't always like her
isolated country life, but next to Eminem's, she says, hers seems
tolerable. ``I play songs like `Rock Bottom' when I'm depressed, to
prove to myself that my life isn't so bad after all.''
</P>
<P>
   Catharsis, in some form or another, comes up in every
conversation with young female fans of angry music. ``They're
letting out their frustration, and I do too, at the same time,''
says 15-year-old Jesica Corbo, a Korn devotee who lives in Dedham,
Mass. Nikki Vanwasshnova, a 21-year-old veteran of hardcore music
fandom who lives in Ypsilanti, Mich., observes that ``they have
problems with something that happened in their lives, and they're
pissed. It's a way of dealing with pain in their own creative way.
That's how I judge a band.'' Kelly O'Connell points out that ``when
you have anger inside, you don't have to take it out on someone
else. It's like the band does it for you.''
</P>
<P>
   While girls, traditionally, have been allowed a certain measure
of angst-ridden growing pains, the real vitriol has always been
accorded to the male gender. Girls brood; boys act out. In one
sense, the emergence of young females fans into the hardcore music
arena signals a leveling of the playing field. The girls aren't
just tagging along with their boyfriends anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to a lot of shows, and the first place my eyes are drawn
to is the mosh pit,'' says Jamie Roberts, director of publicity for
Roadrunner Records, home to Slipknot, Type O Negative, Coal
Chamber, and Machinehead, among others. ``There are an increasing
number of girls in there. I'd never seen girls in the pit before
recently.'' It is, Roberts believes, a step in the right direction.
``I get the sense that the girls know that they can do whatever
boys are doing. It's not a girls' thing or a boys' thing. Hard rock
and metal is really the kids' music now. It's their mode of
rebellion, and it's a pretty safe one.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Will there be a price? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Statistically speaking, aggressive music is a relatively
risk-free way of blowing off steam. But one has to wonder, as
today's artists push the boundaries of savage imagery and
hate-filled verbiage to new extremes _ and children consume it by
the tens of millions _ if there's a price to be paid that can't be
measured in numbers of injuries or arrests. Will a generation
weaned on violence-drenched entertainment be further desensitized
by the music _ arguably one of the most potent forces in a young
person's life?
</P>
<P>
   According to the girls, neither they nor their friends _ male
and female alike _ have trouble differentiating between the fantasy
world of a song and the reality of living humane and civil lives.
The music, they agree, actually helps them to avoid engaging in
antisocial behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone's dumb and depressed, if they're unstable, then
it's different,'' says Vanwasshnova. ``It's like anything else,
something on TV, that could make them snap. But if you have a grip
on yourself, it's a way to deal with feelings instead of going out
and doing something real.''
</P>
<P>
   Says MTV's Doyle: ``We've certainly talked about lyrical
content, and our research shows the reason that females like these
artists is they're coming from a point of honesty about issues
they've been faced with. Like the topic or not, it's real to the
artist, and that's how the fans are taking it.''
</P>
<P>
   The main thing, all agree, is not the literal meaning of a
lyric, but rather the feeling of a song _ conveyed not simply in
words but in the visceral language of screaming guitars and
jackhammer drums, jittery turntables and shredded voices. As
Hawkins points out: ``We all swear at people when we're angry. We
all say we'll kill someone who's annoyed us. But we don't mean
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about the emotion behind it,'' Vanwasshnova says,
summing up what all of these young women have been saying in myriad
ways. ``It's about what you can release.''

THE BANDS SAY THEY'RE SIMPLY VENTING, HONESTLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Last of two parts)
</P>
<P>
   The aggressive music and fiery climax of Woodstock '99 were the
tip-off. The world is not a pretty place to a new era of rock acts
that use anger as their primary motivation. Call it scary, call it
therapy, call it niche marketing, but high-decibel screaming is
shaking the charts and selling in the millions like never before.
</P>
<P>
   Turn on today's rock radio and brace yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rage is bliss!'' sings the band Slipknot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already told you _ stop pushing me!'' shrieks Dope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get away from me, stay the (expletive) away from me!'' barks
Kittie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get up, come on down with the sickness!'' bellows Disturbed.
</P>
<P>
   Road rage. Air rage. And, now, airwave rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge demand for angry music right now. A lot more
angry bands are being signed, because that's what the marketplace
dictates,'' says Jason Wyner, vice president with Artemis Records,
which is having success with Kittie, an all-female metal group from
London, Ontario, that performs such tersely titled rants as
``Spit,'' ``Suck,'' and ``Choke.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, we've seen bands like the Clash and Rage Against
the Machine channel their anger into their political leanings,''
says Oedipus, program director of Boston rock station WBCN. ``But
now, a lot of music is anger for the sake of anger.''
</P>
<P>
   Hot and angry chart acts like Korn and Limp Bizkit have broken
the doors down _ and a new wave is rushing in. Many of the young
venom-spewing rockers are headed toward Boston on the Vans Warped
Tour at Suffolk Downs on Thursday, the Tattoo the Earth Festival at
Suffolk Downs on Saturday, and the Ozzfest at the Tweeter Center
July 29 and 30.
</P>
<P>
   Some wear their mantle of anger as if it's a badge of courage.
``You will never meet a band that is more full of anger than us,''
says Slipknot cofounder/percussionist Shawn Crahan, who describes
his Des Moines-based group as ``nine lunatics in masks and boiler
suits.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Anger is an energy &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I play drums because a psychiatrist told me I needed to vent
some anger,'' says Crahan, adding, ``My job is to wake everybody
up. I'm stripping away all the labels. You're no better than me,
you don't breathe my air, and you don't make my decisions. Too many
people don't have the courage anymore to change the world. Our
world has become nothing but a herd of cattle. And I'm in front of
them in the biggest tree, looking down. I'm not going to be
trampled.''
</P>
<P>
   Slipknot's self-titled debut album, which has gone platinum (1
million sold), is a slamming mix of larynx-scarring vocals,
shredding guitars, punk-laced rhythms, and anxiety-inducing noises
made by clanging on metal objects and weaving in the roar of
electrical saws.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can duplicate the 'Knot,'' says Crahan, who had his
``fair share of problems'' growing up, but is now married with
three children and says ``I will never cheat on my wife and will
never make this a dysfunctional family.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some observers wonder what these musicians can complain
about _ after all, the economy has been thriving and there's no
cause like the Vietnam War to protest about _ Disturbed's singer,
Dave Draiman, says such critics need to wake up.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can delude themselves because the economy is great, or
because there's no war involving American soldiers,'' Draiman says.
``But there's so much more wrong with the world than there was 10
or 20 years ago. The world keeps going in a downward spiral. Not
everything is about the economy. I have three friends who died of
AIDS, and there are children getting killed in gangland crossfires,
and people with SUVs, a condo, and a $50,000-a-year job who are
still killing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's anything wrong with this anger kick in
music. There's a lot to be angry about,'' says Draiman, who was
expelled from five boarding schools in his youth, once for setting
a principal's van on fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family is conversative, religious types,'' he adds. ``They
had planned for me to be a very different person than I am today.
They tried to mold me into the stereotypical child they wanted.
That's why they shipped me around to boarding schools.''
</P>
<P>
   The experiment failed. Draiman finished high school in Chicago,
then went to Los Angeles to play in a band called the Foreskins.
That led to an audition with Disturbed _ and he passed by grabbing
the microphone and venting uncontrollably. He now sometimes comes
onstage in a cage or an electric chair, symbolizing the
imprisonment he feels is his assigned role in society.
</P>
<P>
   Disturbed's fascinating metal-core song ``Down With the
Sickness'' has become a rock hit and paints sickness as an
appropriate response to being labeled a black sheep. ``Madness is
the gift that has been given to me,'' Draiman sings. Another song,
``Violence Fetish,'' is about how people have a natural tendency
toward violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's undeniable,'' he says. ``They watch football games and
boxing matches and see movies about gladiators. But instead of
focusing on it in a negative way, we use music to allow you to get
immersed in a sea of people and let loose. It's better to let it
loose that way than walking a high school corridor with a gun under
your coat.''
</P>
<P>
   That image summons memories of the Columbine High School
shootings in Colorado last year. It was an event that resonated for
every parent, indeed for every grown-up wondering what to make of
the rage in rock music. It's also the incident that inspired Papa
Roach's song ``Dead Cell.'' Says Roach's singer, Coby Dick: ``Maybe
those kids who did it were dead cells. Maybe it's because the media
and their families pushed them that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Papa Roach's impressive debut CD, ``Infest,'' has climbed to No.
9 on the Billboard charts, propelled by the hit, ``Last Resort,''
about contemplating suicide. ``It's about a roommate I had who
finally found God, and for him, that was awesome. He got on with
his life and got better,'' says Dick.
</P>
<P>
   The product of a divorced family, Dick sings another song,
``Broken Home,'' with the bitter line: ``I'm stuck in between my
parents.'' His mother remarried and he hated his stepfather at
first, but ``now he's one of the greatest people to come into my
life.'' Still, Dick, whose band is from Vacaville, Calif., sports a
tattoo of a burning house, suggesting how the pain still cuts deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can store these things in the back of my head, then when I'm
40, have a nervous breakdown because I never got them out,'' he
says. ``Or I can vent them, so I don't keep them inside. Men have a
tough time expressing their emotions, but music is the way to do it
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   In total agreement is Edsel Dope, singer for the band Dope, a
punk act also influenced by old-school Motley Crue-style metal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see the pain in our faces and in the faces of the kids
who are singing back at you,'' he says. ``These emotions have got
to come out. Not everybody is good at sitting down with their
family and talking about it. But sitting in a dark room listening
to music, or going to a show with thousands of other people, is a
way to get it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Edsel Dope grew up in South Florida, and his parents divorced
when he was 4 years old. He had a ``white trash background,'' he
says, then moved to Las Vegas, where he handled customer service
for a phone sex company. He later moved to New York to sell drugs,
which is how his band (founded with his brother, Simon) was first
financed. He also had some run-ins with the police, which led to
the viciously angry tunes ``Pig Society'' and ``America the
Pitiful,'' which are on Dope's new album, ``Felons and
Revolutionaries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really angry that they could take people who just smoke
pot and throw them in prisons with violent criminals. That's what
really started to screw with my head,'' he says. He won't talk
about whether that prison experience is a personal memory, but on
Dope's CD jacket, the band members are pictured inside prison
cells. &QL; 
 &QL; 
It's just an expression &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unleashing anger, for whatever reason, is the result of
``feeling oppressed and victimized,'' according to Dr. Michael
Rater, medical director of the adolescent residential treatment
center at the Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass.
He also cites a ``new level of vulgarity'' in some of today's rock,
which he sees as an outgrowth of the anger expressed in an earlier
generation by punk bands such as the Sex Pistols and Dead Kennedys.
</P>
<P>
   Rater, who has spent time analyzing Korn lyrics with patients at
his center, notes how ``all of this anger gets channeled fairly
quickly into marketable niches where it can be enjoyed without huge
societal impact.'' For that matter, he adds, ``If you're
functioning well, to be able to blow off steam is probably kind of
fun. It's self-affirming to do that.'' He sees the positive side of
the phenomenon and even notes how the ``physicality'' of the mosh
pits that form at many rock concerts ``can be attractive'' to young
people in search of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Rage Against the Machine's famed anti-authority
chant of ``(Expletive) you, I won't do what you tell me!'' Rater
calmly explains: ``Is that really much different from (Bob Dylan's)
`I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more'?''
</P>
<P>
   One group whose members don't come from dysfunctional
backgrounds is Kittie. The group consists of women who led ``fairly
normal lives,'' says singer Morgan Lander. She always loved
hard-rock music _ from Van Halen and AC/DC to Tool and Helmet _ and
steered that way when she realized the power of her voice. ``My
early voice sounded like a raccoon getting hit by a hammer, but
then it developed,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Kittie's musicians are still in their teens and advertise
themselves as the hard-rock alternative to frilly teen pop stars
like Britney Spears. Kittie, known as the ``anti-Britney,'' hasn't
had it easy, however, because the group is competing in the
predominantly male genre of heavy metal. One of their songs,
``Raven,'' was inspired by a death threat received from a male band
against whom they competed in an Ontario talent contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our songs are all about not letting anyone hold you down,''
says Kittie's Lander. ``We're not trying to be preachers, but we're
not going to be pushed around.''

SHEEN'S IMAGE ADDS NEW SPIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, CALIF. _ Michael J. Fox, the now-departed star of
``Spin City,'' has projected a clean-cut, wholesome aura throughout
his career, remaining the boy next door even as he neared 40.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Sheen, who is replacing Fox this fall as the new deputy
mayor on the ABC sitcom, has a somewhat . . . different image.
Sheen became tabloid fodder in the mid-1990s amid revelations that
he ran up a tab of $53,000 with prostitutes working for Hollywood
madam Heidi Fleiss.
</P>
<P>
   So the obvious question hanging over the upcoming fifth season
of ``Spin City'' is: Will viewers accept the brooding Sheen in a
role designed for the sunny Fox?
</P>
<P>
   ``America likes a guy that's been down and is trying to get
up,'' executive producer Gary David Goldberg said hopefully. ``Look
at Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than run from Sheen's bad-boy image, Goldberg has opted
to play off it by creating for Sheen a character, Charlie Owen,
whose checkered past made him a gossip-column fixture. ``Fun finds
me,'' the character says ruefully. Sheen said Monday that he
envisions playing the role as a way to dispel his reputation by
proving ``I can laugh at myself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To ignore the reality of the lifestyle I led for a time _ a
long time _ would be a disservice,'' said Sheen. Not that he wants
``Spin City'' to mirror his life too closely. Some parts of his
past, he admitted, ``really have no place on network television.''
</P>
<P>
   Even apart from image questions, Sheen faces a major challenge
in trying to fill Fox's shoes and cross from films into series
television for the first time. One of the obstacles is his own
father, Martin Sheen, a star of NBC's acclaimed drama ``The West
Wing,'' which will air opposite ``Spin City.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The shows are so different, it's almost like people looking in
their video stores and deciding whether to watch ``Apocalypse
(Now)'' or `Major League,'' Sheen said, alluding to the somber war
epic starring his father and a goofy baseball comedy starring
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Father and son have discussed the unusual competition facing
them, and Sheen the elder has made a cocky prediction to Sheen the
younger. ``He says he's going to watch (`Spin City') tumble down in
the ratings as he stomps us with both feet,'' said Charlie Sheen.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Spin City'' is billed as an ensemble comedy, the reality
is that it was built around Fox. When Fox, who has Parkinson's
disease, announced he was leaving the sitcom to devote his energies
to battling and raising public awareness of the disease,
``Everyone's first instinct was to end the show, frankly,''
Goldberg said. But Fox urged that the show continue.
</P>
<P>
   It is rare for a show to survive the departure of the leading
character, although Goldberg pointed out that ``Cheers'' flourished
even after Shelley Long left, and that ``MASH'' withstood major
cast changes. Heather Locklear, who joined the ``Spin City'' cast
last year, is returning, and Goldberg said the supporting cast will
find their parts beefed up.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Fox has offered some reassuring words to his
successor, according to Sheen: ``He said `Don't worry. They'll
still tune in.' ''

IT'S JUST NOT THE `RIDE' IT COULD HAVE BEEN

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES: ``Ride With the Devil'' (DVD) _ Ang Lee's Civil
War epic would seem to have everything going for it. It's set in
Missouri, where the guerrilla battles between Southern sympathizers
and the Yankees provide enough action and historical ambiguity to
satisfy the most demanding viewers. But there's a real problem.
It's style. The actors are just too clean to be convincing
19th-century hell-raisers. The long locks on the men look as if
they just had a double herbal rinsing in the hairdresser's trailer.
Even when one character gets his finger shot off, it's
spectacularly unconvincing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angela's Ashes'' _ Frank McCourt's touchingly tough memoir
loses a lot in its translation to the screen. McCourt's prose,
which delicately bridged the abyss between sentimentality and
despair, was obviously sacrificed to the needs of the cinema. While
reading the book, readers create their own mental movie. In this
case, seeing is not necessarily believing. Somewhere along the way,
the magic disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW ON DVD: ``Harold and Maude'' (1971) _ Hal Ashby, who went on
to direct films such as ``Shampoo'' and ``Being There,'' made this
charming, offbeat movie about a nutty kid named Harold, who lives
to talk about death, and a crazy old lady named Maude. While the
dark comedy has lost some of its edge over the past three decades,
Ruth Gordon's portrayal of Maude is marvelously cranky. Bud Cort,
who went on to repeat variations of the nutty loner in subsequent
films, makes for a suitable companion. Some of the key principals _
notably Ashby and Gordon _ have died, and with this restriction on
what commentary could be provided, the DVD producers elected not to
include the usual additional features. (It would have been
interesting to hear a commentary track by Cort.) But the print is
pristine and the sound quality superb, so those who just want to
see an old favorite in mint condition should be content.

HARRY POTTER: OLDER, CRAFTIER, WORTH EVERY PAGE

HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE 
By J. K. Rowling. 
Arthur A. Levine/Scholastic Press. 734 pp. $25.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As we workaday Muggles settle into summer and our summer
reading, ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' is beckoning, the
fourth installment of J. K. Rowling's fantasy series about
boarding-school life for the orphaned Harry at the Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
</P>
<P>
   The lines at bookstores have disappeared, the precious volumes
have been lugged home, the hype has trickled off. But the question
remains: Is it a worthwhile exercise this summer to stretch out on
that backyard lawn chair with a time-eating, rib-crushing, 734-page
children's book on one's chest?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is yes. Yes, yes, yes _ for children and also for
adults.
</P>
<P>
   It is no small feat for Rowling to keep the magic going in this
novel. She has set a series of tasks for herself as challenging as
the ones Harry undertakes in the perilous Triwizard Tournament:
Sustain multiple plotlines. Keep familiar characters believable and
interesting, even as they mature into pubescent wizardry. Introduce
new and compelling characters. Refer back to the previous
installments while laying the groundwork for the next ones. Be
funny. Be scary. Allude to contemporary social issues without
preaching. Oh yes, and write a book that will appeal to adults as
well as children.
</P>
<P>
   A lesser practitioner would have been intimidated into agonizing
writer's block. But Rowling rose to the challenge in an engaging
novel that is compelling, accessible, and impressively even in
quality.
</P>
<P>
   Her prose is strong and often sings, even though she
occasionally reveals imperfect pitch. The story drags a bit
periodically, generally when the action slows down and Harry and
his allies attempt to move the story along by ruminating out loud
about villains' motives. (``Harry nodded. Silence fell between them
again, Dumbledore extracting thoughts every now and then.'')
</P>
<P>
   And it is hard at times to reconcile the writer who came up with
the ingenious notion of the ``Pensieve'' (a stone basin into which
one pours excess thoughts on stressful days, and then examines them
at one's leisure) with the one who goes for the cheap laugh by
titling a reference book ``Men Who Love Dragons Too Much.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the book is heavily derivative, and there are
those who will sniff at Rowling's borrowings. Literary references
abound _ to George Orwell, to Jonathan Swift, to Lewis Carroll, to
folkloric themes involving giants _ crowding the pages like so many
wing-flapping hippogriffs.
</P>
<P>
   But these are minor concerns given how much delight this book
will bring to readers.
</P>
<P>
   With any series, it is tempting to ask whether the new book
measures up to the previous ones. In the case of Harry Potter, the
matter seems irrelevant. Each book in the series brings Harry along
through another school year, and by volume four we are solidly
invested in the Hogwarts crowd, reading less with an eye to
comparison than for updates on our old friends.
</P>
<P>
   The Hogwarts characters are another year older in ``The Goblet
of Fire,'' and they've matured without changing their identities.
Harry's friend Hermione, always prone to idealism and
soft-heartedness, has taken on a cause in her adolescence. (She is
opposed to the enslavement of house-elves, and has started
organizing to end their oppression.) Their chum Ron Weasley is as
loyal as ever, but at 14, he clearly has his issues, and they're
starting to trip him up. A lifetime of sibling rivalry and family
poverty has exaggerated his jealousies and made him fiercely
competitive and insecure.
</P>
<P>
   And our hero Harry is coming into his own, for better or worse.
He unfolds as a complex character prone to stubbornness,
self-centeredness, and procrastination; you want to scream at him
for wasting so much time inviting a girl to the dance, and blowing
his chance to snag his first choice. Yet we hail his utter decency,
and nearly weep for him at his vulnerable moments, as when he longs
for a caring mother figure and yet his tears can't seem to fall.
(Pity the poor witch who lands this guy. She'll have her hands full
nudging him to emote.)
</P>
<P>
   And Dobby's back! The affectionate if badly dressed house-elf,
much missed in volume three, has returned in ``The Goblet of
Fire,'' making yet another strange sartorial statement with a tea
cozy for a hat. We're also happy to see Moaning Myrtle, still
kvetching constantly from her residence in the S-bend in the
plumbing. And Nearly Headless Nick, a Hogwarts ghost with a
partially severed neck. And the anthropomorphized Sorting Hat,
which assigns Hogwarts freshmen to their proper Houses.
</P>
<P>
   These returnees are welcome in part because they give the novel
the richness and eccentricities of real life. They are well matched
by memorable new characters like the zaftig half-giant Madame
Maxime, in denial about her girth (`` 'Alf-giant? Moi? _ I'ave big
bones,'' she insists). Beware the horrifying horde of Death Eaters,
the sycophantic followers of the evil Voldemort.
</P>
<P>
   Rowling has the rare ability to take children's fantasy worlds
and their workaday worlds with equal seriousness, and she speaks to
both in ``Goblet of Fire.'' The ending gallops along to a
nail-biting conclusion, and yes, someone dies, and no, it's not
Harry. He will be back soon, we can only hope, to advance to
another form at Hogwarts. We do not relish his graduation.

VERMONT COLLEGE CAUGHT IN SPORTS FUROR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every year, hundreds of students at Champlain College throng to
Memorial Auditorium for the Great Northern Shoot-out. It's a rare
chance to show school spirit. But in two years, the rousing
season-opening basketball tournament will cease to exist.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the Champlain Beavers, long a powerhouse in
junior college sports, won't be around to host the games. Last
month, after students left for the summer, the small
career-oriented college in Burlington, Vt., eliminated all varsity
sports _ one of the few private, four-year colleges ever to take
such a step.
</P>
<P>
   The decision had nothing to do with financial problems, school
officials said. Abolishing varsity sports, they argue, is an
innovative way to free up resources for intramural sports, in
essence slashing top-notch basketball and soccer programs so more
students can take part in everything from kayaking to rock
climbing.
</P>
<P>
   Now, supporters of the varsity teams are reeling, saying that
the end of Beaver sports will hurt school morale and alumni
relations as well. They accuse the administration of disregarding
student support for the teams and defying the recommendation of a
special commission.
</P>
<P>
   And for some of the athletes and coaches, the end of varsity
sports is devastating. Bob Tipson, coach of the men's basketball
team for the last 33 years, who has the eighth best record in
National Junior College Athletic Association history, says the
decision will rip the heart out of the college.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel like you let some people down,'' Tipson lamented,
wondering, ``Was there something else I could have said? Was there
something else I could have done? It's not just the alums, it's the
ones that I haven't coached. The ones who will never get a chance.
It's really just sad.''
</P>
<P>
   In defending the college's decision, which takes effect in the
2002-2003 school year, Champlain president Roger Perry said the
administration spent much of the past year consulting students and
faculty. After surveys and meetings indicated a lackluster interest
in the varsity sports program compared with intramural sports, he
said, the trustees decided it would be better to spend the $500,000
annual varsity budget on a multimillion-dollar facility to increase
students' access to sports, including snowboarding and sailing.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, he said, is to quadruple the number of students on
campus involved in sports, so they're more likely to play than
watch. Now, only about 50 students participate on the three varsity
sports teams _ men's basketball and men's and women's soccer.
Champlain has 1,380 full-time students and 1,105 part-timers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were spending a lot of money for only a few students,''
Perry said. ``This was essentially a business decision. People say
universities don't know how to make priorities and choices. Well,
that's what we're doing. We want more inclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the administration is miscalculating the value
of the varsity sports program. Support from alumni might diminish,
they argue, while school spirit will wane, and nearly $1 million in
tuition money from student athletes will vanish.
</P>
<P>
   Janine Fagan, a 23-year-old center-forward on the women's soccer
team who moved from England to play for Champlain, scoffs at any
suggestion that students aren't interested in varsity sports.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever she goes, she said, people always admire that she plays
for Champlain, which won the NCJAA women's soccer national
championships in 1994 and 1998. The men's basketball team,
meanwhile, has been a top contender for the title five times in the
last decade and the men's soccer team took regional titles in the
1995 and 1997 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's devastating to think that a school with such a high
reputation for its sports program is going to end it all,'' Fagan
said. ``To carry the name on your shirt and your shoulder is very
important. This is like cutting off your nose to spite your face.
And in the long run, I think this could be the downfall of
Champlain.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial questions about the longevity of the varsity sports
program arose in the college's marketing department. Champlain
first began offering four-year bachelor's degrees in 1991. Now,
nearly 90 percent of the students seek such diplomas. The problem,
marketing officials said, is that each time a team wins a
high-profile game, the media mention they're competing against
junior colleges. That, Perry and other school officials say, gives
prospective students the wrong impression.
</P>
<P>
   The image problem sparked interest across the campus in the
Beavers joining a four-year athletic association, such as the
National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics. Perry and
trustees said it was simply too expensive for the college, which
has an operating budget of about $25 million, to maintain the
varsity program and launch a serious intramural program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is a series of tradeoffs,'' he said. ``Dollars have to
follow priorities. It's like a family budget. I would love a boat,
an airplane, and a Lexus. But we can't have it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Collins, chairman of the college's board of trustees,
insisted the decision serves the college's best interests. ``The
college and the student body has changed,'' he said. ``The best
information we have shows this is what students want. And one of
the reasons Champlain is healthy is because it makes difficult,
soul-searching decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics from students to professors argue the administration
misread student surveys in deciding they didn't care about varsity
sports. For example, a Champlain survey cites 43.5 percent of
students saying the varsity sports program doesn't interest them at
all. But that means 56.5 percent of the students are interested,
the critics note.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was always a lot of school spirit here, and a lot of
people rallied around the teams,'' said Elizabeth Hartwick, a
21-year-old senior who signed a petition with hundreds of other
students in favor of keeping the varsity teams. ``Our name was
athletics. That's what we were. Now it's gone, and I'm wondering
what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   So is David Mona, an assistant professor of accounting who has
taught at Champlain for 15 years. Like others at Champlain, he
doesn't understand how the trustees made the leap from considering
moving the teams to another league to eliminating them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The natural decision would have been to take the sports teams
out of a junior league and put (them) in a four-year sports
league,'' he said. ``That would be the capstone for the transition.
But I just can't understand this. We're financially healthy enough
to do both. Is this for the sake of being unique?''
</P>
<P>
   Now, after years of coaching at Champlain, both Tipson and Sue
Rand, the college's athletic director and women's soccer coach, are
mulling a future neither ever expected.
</P>
<P>
   Tipson, who has been at Champlain since studying there as an
undergraduate, and Rand, who has worked in the athletic department
for 18 years and has turned down several job offers, are both
dusting off their resumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had planned to spend the rest of my career here,'' Rand
said. ``But that's minor in the greater scheme. We have a history
and legacy of successful athletic programs. They're a large part of
the overall college experience. The students are going to miss
that.''

   !! ``American Pimp'' Hardly the searching look at the sex
industry it could have been, this documentary by Allen and Albert
Hughes interviews pimps uncritically, accepting their fast-talking
testimony at face value, emphasizing the pimps' colorful,
entertaining side, downplaying the exploitation of women on which
their prosperity rests. (Unrated)
</P>
<P>
   (FU) ! 1/2 ``But I'm a Cheerleader'' Lame satire of homophobia,
painted in Day-Glo colors, as a teen perceived as lesbian is sent
to a heterosexual boot camp to be ``cured.'' Natasha Lyonne, as the
cheerleader, and Clea DuVall, as the smoldering camper she falls
for, turn in good performances (most notably in a tender lovemaking
scene), but the rest of this flimsy film crashes and burns around
them. (R)
</P>
<P>
   !! 1/2 ``X-Men'' It could have been more than a big-screen
version of the popular comic series, but it isn't. Dark, handsome
visuals that might have resonated provocatively with themes of
bigotry and alienation settle instead for slick good mutant-bad
mutant stuff, with Patrick Stewart as the good mutants' guru and
Ian McKellen as his opposite number. Hugh Jackman, as the pained,
steel-clawed Wolverine, comes off best among the action figures.

KENYA'S ELEPHANTS SURE OFFER A LOT TO LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEWA DOWNS, Kenya _ The view from the swimming pool, which hangs
on the lip of the Isiola Valley, is, shall we say, elephantine.
Across the gap, on the faded green and ecru slope, there are so
many dark gray elephants wandering about that they could hire out
as symbolic extras at the forthcoming GOP convention.
</P>
<P>
   Call it Republican Ridge, although that might offend the
resident mammoths since they're smarter than most of us. Maybe
because they've been around longer. They're also more peaceful.
That's not to say they don't get riled or aren't troublesome.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can be mischievous,'' Phil West says. ``They're why you
didn't have any water in your room this morning. They like to tear
up the water pipes, but we'll have them fixed soon. Those guys can
be a bother, but we love them.''
</P>
<P>
   Who wouldn't? So, who needs a shower? Just jump in the pool.
Float on your back and gaze over at the ``ellies,'' as Phil calls
them. Phil, whom I call ``Mwalimu'' (``teacher,'' in Swahili),
delights in imparting items of his vast comprehension of the
African bush. He's the head guide at Lewa Downs, a mellowing-out
refuge in the wilds of Kenya's Highlands where life moves at a
satisfyingly pachydermic pace. A family lineup of ellies in transit
reminds you of a slow freight, and sometimes the whistle _ a
trumpeting _ sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be deceived by their size, and that shuffling gait,''
Phil says. ``They can hustle if they need to. If you've annoyed
them and they are in a mind to trample you _ well, you can't outrun
them. But you can walk with them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can,'' I say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can. Believe me. We'll drive over there, then leave the car
and walk.''
</P>
<P>
   A walk with Mwalimu, the ambulatory professor in khakis whose
classroom today covers several miles of lonely, uneven terrain, a
lot of it dense bush, is always enlightening. Or a drive.
</P>
<P>
   The day before had offered a good one across the silvery
grassland of Simba Ridge in an open car. On surprising a couple of
ugly dukelings _ two bull rhinos _ duking it out with horny head
butts in a clearing, the driver, Peter Munoro, said it was all
about dating rights. He nodded toward the prize, an interested
party poking her double-pronged head out of the scrub.
</P>
<P>
   Not far away was a panorama that could have been a tribute to
the National Basketball Association: two teams of five giraffes
accompanied by a couple of zebras. Somebody had forgotten a ball.
Should the zebras have volunteered to referee for the pugnacious
rhinos?
</P>
<P>
   These were reticulated giraffes with distinctive body patterns.
Their terra cotta-hued hides seemed the work of wall-building
masons who've separated the large blocks with white lines of
mortar.
</P>
<P>
   Farther along, dipping into a ravine, we encountered the scarce
antelope that obsessed Ernest Hemingway, the hunter: a male greater
kudu of at least 500 pounds, light gray and topped by elegant
high-spiraling horns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eureka!'' I whispered, remembering a solid, fruitless week of
driving and tramping through Tanzania 35 years ago, searching for
kudus. Apparently inheriting his father's fixation, Dr. Greg
Hemingway, the leader of that hunting safari, was haunted by an
Ahabian desire to bag one for himself. Many tracks and reported
sightings _ but no cigar. Not even a glimmer.
</P>
<P>
   Belatedly here was a big daddy that Papa H. would have coveted.
Shortly, in the brush, appeared three bareheaded females.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it worth the wait?'' said New Yorker Royce Battlemans,
watching with her husband, David.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gosh, yes. Three queens and a king _ a kudu flush.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't bet on it happening again,'' said another rider, Angela
Bromley-Martin from England. She and her husband, David, have been
around the African blocks a few times.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't bet against anything happening since each day's
sights and experiences are so varied.
</P>
<P>
   After a few miles came the word ``Cheetahs!'' from Peter at the
wheel. He stopped the car and turned off the engine.
</P>
<P>
   Angela smiled, ``Now behold this scene. Mind you, we're all
voyeurs.'' Ahead, a male ostrich, a dandy in formal plumage, black
and white, was coming on to a dowdy-looking female in gruel gray.
Rocking and rolling in the courtship dance, jiggling spindly
scarlet legs and neck, he waved his white wings seductively, and
impressively enough. As they got it on discreetly, the lovers had
the full attention of arrayed peeping toms across the savannah: us,
a cheetah quartet, five Grant's gazelles (their bachelor horns
twinkling in the sun), a giraffe, six female impalas, an oryx, two
hyenas. Transfixed. Sex sells.
</P>
<P>
   Only the cheetahs' sleek, spotted faces and overreaching,
twitching tails were visible in a thicket. They looked like
See-no-evil, Speak-no-evil, Hear-no-evil and Can-do-evil. Looking
like candidates for positions in an antelope harem, the impalas had
arrived, leaping high, gliding smoothly, perhaps dreaming, ``Some
day he'll come along _ the ram I love.''
</P>
<P>
   But everything seemed to stop until the ostriches parted.
</P>
<P>
   Today starts early. We're out of the car before breakfast, and
the quest is elephants. Mwalimu Phil lugs his .458 Winchester, for
emergency use only. Hunting in Kenya has been taboo for almost 25
years. ``You're safe in a car, and the animals look fairly
harmless. But you shouldn't underrate them,'' he says. ``Remember
they are wild, so I take a gun when we walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next year we hope to offer six-day walking safaris, tenting at
night away from the lodge. You won't cover the area a car or van
could, and you may not see as many animals. But being on the ground
with them is the best, the genuine safari experience.''
</P>
<P>
   We're on the ground all right, my friend Aurelio and I trudging
a hillside with Phil. We pause often for him to describe sights
that aren't sights at all to aliens, easily overlooked until he
singles them out and lectures. ``Matabele ants down there. See?''
He says the 2-inch creatures are ``savages. They'll eat anything.
They break in and raid termite mounds. If they can get a crowd
together they can take out an antelope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's what we call a diet tree, the boscia. You grind up the
bark, add to tea or milk, and it dissipates hunger. Knobwood bark
there. Make it into tea that cures flu.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're walking through an outdoor pharmacy. See that plant, the
rhus natalensis. If you're weary, chew the stems and it'll keep you
awake. Make a tea out of the bark of this tree, the acacia
tortillis, and it'll fix a sore throat. Pick those desert dates,
boil them down to stop a cold. It's said the leaves from the
bossier tree can be used to alleviate epilepsy. There's so much
natural medicine out here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, whoa, right here. Danger. This fruit is a Sodom apple.
Poison for us. But ellies like to eat them to ease indigestion.
Elephants have a terrible digestive system. They have to eat
massive amounts, and don't use much of it. They eliminate most of
it, 60 percent, as you can see. Piles of it. They have awful table
manners. Look at all these trees they've knocked over so they can
get at the leaves.''
</P>
<P>
   We've descended into a lugga, a dry riverbed, and Phil seems to
be more attentive. There's thick cover on the left, a good hideout
for buffalo. ``Stay close behind me now. We don't want any of them
charging out.''
</P>
<P>
   But then all mastadonic hell breaks loose.
</P>
<P>
   Elephants are showing up everywhere, like relatives and
creditors when you hit the lottery. Left . . . right . . . front .
. . back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow, a lot of them,'' says Phil.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what Custer said about the Indians,'' says Aurelio.
</P>
<P>
   On a ledge above us a young bull appears to be weeping. Phil
says, ``He's in musth _ you know, heat, love crazy. The fluid
flowing from the temporal gland near his eye tells us that. He
could be edgy, excitable. We want to move away from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Retreating farther along the lugga, we find a stretch of granite
that is tiered and resembles a section of a Grecian amphitheater.
It would be nice to sit here and take in the elly show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not now. We have to keep moving. We don't want to be
surrounded.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, we are. Looming like gigantic dusky boulders, are
they closing in? I think of MacBeth and Birnham Wood. Adrenaline is
pumping. Over on the right a nervous cow, guarding her calf, flaps
blanket ears _ not a good sign. Mom accompanies that signal by
bellowing, ``Wah-owwww!'' This is not cheering.
</P>
<P>
   Phil remains cool as we walk one way, then another. ``Evasive
action. We have to be sure not to invade their comfort zone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What about my comfort zone?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're careful not to get behind any of them. They want to be
dominant, keep us in view. Fine. We want them to see us, realize we
mean no harm.'' Mwalimu knows what he's doing. We have just about
maneuvered to an opening but the protective mother, about 30 yards
distant, begins to advance our way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, we come in peace,'' I mumble. ``Phil, why don't you call
a taxi.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good idea,'' he says, laughing and pulling out a walkie-talkie
to direct a driver to a spot he thinks the car and we can reach.
</P>
<P>
   Mom takes another giant step . . . reconsiders and turns around.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly a chorus line of female zebras rumbles through, a chain
gang tripping the light fantastic, breaking the tension. The ellies
are spreading out, going about their business.
</P>
<P>
   The field clear, we start walking to the spot where the driver,
Kilai Munyori, is waiting. He takes us to a shady grove and cooks
breakfast for other guests who've been riding horseback.
</P>
<P>
   Fried eggs and sausage taste very good. Phil raises a cup of
coffee, ``Here's to your digestion. May it be better than an
ellie's.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while I wasn't so sure. It seems a good time for a swim
and another look at elephants without taking evasive action.
</P>

WHY CAN'T THE MEDIA STOP OVERRATING MEDIA EVENTS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oh what a difference a year makes. Just about this time last
summer, the media world was atwitter with expectations about Tina
Brown's new Talk magazine.
</P>
<P>
   In a carefully staged rollout, ``the queen of buzz'' _ as Brown
had become known during stops at Vanity Fair and The New Yorker _
previewed her first issue to a chosen few reporters, daintily
thumbing through the pages as if they were printed on gold leaf.
Talk's coming-out party at the Statue of Liberty attracted an array
of partygoers _ from Henry Kissinger to Madonna _ on the glitterati
A-list. Of Talk's launch, The (London) Independent gushed: ``the
media event of the year, if not the decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the headlines are different. ``Is Talk making a last
stand?'' The New York Post asked recently. In a particularly
pungent piece, Toronto's National Post called Brown and Hillary
Clinton former ``power babes,'' who'd been reduced to ``humbled,
sweaty working women with struggling start-ups.''
</P>
<P>
   The August issue of Talk _ with a cover shot of Elizabeth Hurley
kittenishly gnawing on some shiny jewelry _ epitomizes the
magazine's nagging identity problem. Part celebrity fanzine (the
Hurley story), part serious journalism (revisiting a 43-year-old
race crime in Alabama), and part Johnny-come-too-lately (excerpts
from screenwriter Joe Eszterhas's new book based on the
beaten-to-death Monica Lewinsky scandal), the magazine never found
a niche. Despite all the early hype, has anyone ever heard a real
person utter a syllable about Talk at the water cooler?
</P>
<P>
   So why did it take the big media mandarins a while to figure out
what the public intuitively sensed about Talk?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the audience in a lot of ways is a lot more
sophisticated than we give them credit for,'' says J. Max Robins,
senior editor at TV Guide.
</P>
<P>
   True, but there's something else at play. While influential
journalists create megahype and hyperbuzz about magazines like
``Talk,'' movies like ``The Insider,'' TV shows like ``Action'' and
Web sites like Inside.com, the public's response is often a
collective yawn. Observers say that's because there's a pop-culture
chasm between big media and the populace that mirrors the famous
``Beltway disconnect'' between political journalists who
hyperventilated over the Lewinsky story for a year and the
scandal-weary citizenry.
</P>
<P>
   The common thread here is media self-absorption. The Lewinsky
story generated so much coverage because it reinvigorated a
Washington press corps that had been rendered increasingly
irrelevant by the public's diminishing interest in politics. It's
not surprising, then, that the objects of the most lavish media
hype tend to come from the media.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lichter, president of the Center for Media and Public
Affairs, refers to this phenomenon as the ``Buzzway.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
The way of buzz &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing fascinates the media more than the media,'' says
Lichter. ``There's always been a buzz production industry and I
think it's gotten more automated. Hype moves faster and it cuts
across more media lines.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about a culture of narcissism,'' adds media
critic Jon Katz. ``I think the media has become one of the most
disconnected elites in American life.''
</P>
<P>
   In the world of entertainment television, two recent ``Buzzway''
favorites were given their last rites by viewers. ``Sports Night,''
a comedy featuring clever, fast-talking journalists at an ESPN-like
network, was canceled by ABC. ``Action,'' a Fox comedy about the
outrageous inner workings of Hollywood (kind of ``Get Shorty''
without a protagonist), crashed and burned commercially.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day, I think (``Action'') was really a funny show. It
was really edgy,'' says Robins. ``But it turned out to be too
inside-the-business to get the kind of audience you need to sustain
a network show.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant Gumbel's 1999 return to early morning news on CBS's ``The
Early Show'' was a media event huge enough to generate a New York
Times Magazine piece. Gumbel's story line was similar to Brown's:
Could the longtime ``Today'' anchor replicate his success at a new
network?
</P>
<P>
   The public couldn't have cared less. Ratings for ``The Early
Show'' were lousy until recently, when CBS managed to piggyback on
the success of its red-hot ``Survivor'' show by working it into the
morning-show format. (Perhaps Dawn Wells, the perky Mary Ann on
``Gilligan's Island'' who recently appeared on the show to discuss
``Survivor'' from her unique perspective, has as much to do with
the improving numbers as Gumbel.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Meet the press movie &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 movie that captivated the journalism world was ``The
Insider,'' a tale of how corporate pressure almost forced ``60
Minutes'' to spike an interview with a tobacco industry
whistleblower. This saga of network news intrigue and the hard
feelings between ``60 Minutes'' star Mike Wallace and the
filmmakers fascinated journalists and bored everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider'' is ``one of those classic media brawls that
media critics have an orgasm over. But the public doesn't give a
hoot,'' said Katz at the time. He was right. Though the film
garnered an Oscar nomination for best picture, it was far from
box-office boffo.
</P>
<P>
   On the radio dial, talk host Don Imus's proclivity to chat up
members of the chattering classes, such as Tim Russert and Dan
Rather, has rewarded him with heaps of big-media attention. Several
years ago, Time named him one of the 25 most influential Americans,
and in the July issue of George magazine he's one of a handful of
luminaries selected as the nation's ``New Patriots.''
</P>
<P>
   But Imus's numbers have never matched his hype. In Boston, where
he toils for new FM talk station WTKK, the latest ratings have his
morning show in 15th place. It is the happily incorrigible Howard
Stern, the subject of journalistic disdain, who dominates the
ratings in his time slot.
</P>
<P>
   In cyberspace, mediacentric Web sites such as Slate.com
(slate.msn.com) and the new Inside.com (www.inside.com) are all but
doomed, says Katz. The sites ``that are not successful are about
media themselves,'' he says. ``The central conceit . . . is the
idea that the media is inherently fascinating,'' but the Internet
ethos is all about openness and full access, not about restricting
content to insiders in the know.
</P>
<P>
   Lichter says the media establishment's tastes don't match the
public's because its members belong to an elite class that tends to
``share a perspective, a sensibility that diverges from middle
America. . . . It's more cultural than political.'' Several years
ago, the Center for Media and Public Affairs commissioned a poll
that asked 3,000 Americans whether they thought most journalists
shared their beliefs or values. More than half the respondents _ 53
percent _ said no.
</P>
<P>
   From the tizzy over Talk to the ruckus over ``Action,'' that
sure seems to be true when it comes to stoking the pop-culture hype
machine.

   You've seen ``The Perfect Storm,'' now what? Visit the new
Mystic Seaport exhibit ``Voyages: Stories of America and the Sea,''
which offers a national perspective on the sea's role in defining
our national identity. Seven sections devoted to immigration,
foreign trade, recreation, inspiration, Navy life, fisheries, and
the nation's rivers feature interactive and hands-on exhibits, live
performances, and videos. The fisheries portion begins with the
start of the 500-year-old codfish industry and ends as Fred
Calabretta, one of the exhibit's creators, notes, ``modern
fishermen are as endangered as the wild aquatic species they
hunt.'' The display examines the unsolved problem of supply vs.
demand. Mystic Seaport is the nation's leading maritime museum with
a historic village and tall ships. It's just off Interstate 95 in

   Thirty roads in 20 states have been designated All-American
Roads or National Scenic Byways for 2000. US Transportation
Secretary Mortimer Downey said the roads provide visitors with a
unique driving experience and are considered destinations unto

these roads that have become American icons, Downey said. In New
England, the Acadia Byway in Maine was named an All-American Road,
and named National Scenic Byways were Connecticut State Route 169
and the Merritt Parkway; Old Canada Road, Rangely Lakes, and
Schoodic scenic byways in Maine; and the Kancamagus Highway in New
Hampshire. For information, visit www.byways.org or call

YOUR TALL SHIPS DREAMS CAN COME TRUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the hundreds of thousands of people who toured the Tall
Ships as they visited the East Coast (continuing on to Maine, and
then Halifax, Nova Scotia, before crossing the Atlantic), interest
in the vessels is high. For many, the event has sparked a dream to
sail aboard one.
</P>
<P>
   That dream can be a reality. A sailing vacation is an option
many are taking.
</P>
<P>
   Along the Maine coast there are windjammers galore, some listed
as national treasures. In the Caribbean, Windjammer Barefoot
Cruises has a fleet that sails regularly to interesting and
off-the-beaten-path islands.
</P>
<P>
   Star Clipper offers the Royal Clipper, the world's largest true
sailing ship. Windstar Cruises has three computer-operated sailing
vessels that sail the world. Even Club Med has a sailing outpost.
</P>
<P>
   Heading to Maine for a one- to four-day sail among the beautiful
islands of Penobscot Bay will give you a feel for what it's like.
North End Shipyard Schooners offers two vessels, the American Eagle
and Schooner Heritage. Windjammer Cruises has a fleet of 13 vessels
that sail from Rockland and Camden, Maine. These are all genuine
sailing vessels, cruising primarily in the Penobscot Bay area,
which is filled with islands. The American Eagle has auxiliary
power and is able to cruise farther to take part in the Gloucester
Schooner Race in September. Most of the sailings are for three or
four days, with a few up to seven days.
</P>
<P>
   For information, call Windjammer at 800-807-WIND or visit
www.sailmainecoast.com; for the North End fleet, call 800-648-4544
or visit www.midcoast.com/-schooner.
</P>
<P>
   Windjammer Barefoot is as casual as you'd expect from a company
that uses ``barefoot'' in its name. There are no crowds (just
64-124 passengers), no regimen, but there are land-based
eco-adventures. Its sailings are all six days in beautiful
Caribbean waters. For information, call 800-327-2601.
</P>
<P>
   For a real sailing adventure that touches on ports in Europe,
the Mediterranean, Southeast Asia, and the Caribbean, Star Clippers
(800-442-0551) can't be beat. The company's Star Clipper and Star
Flyer are based on the great clipper ships that once were built in
Boston. The new Royal Clipper is inspired by the Preussen of the
Flying P Lines, which from 1902-1910 dominated the sea lanes of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Windstar Cruises (800-258-7245) offers sailngs in the Caribbean,
Europe, Belize, and Costa Rica. The vessels offer a luxurious
computer-operated sailing experience. Club Med 2 (800-CLUB MED)
brings the fun of a Club Med village to sea, also on a vessel with
computer-equipped sails. It home ports in winter in Martinique.
</P>
<P>
   One of the newest sailing adventures is aboard the luxurious
three-masted Barquentine, the Lili Marleen. This genuine sailing
vessel carries just 50 passengers in modern comfort (it was built
in 1994). The Lili Marleen sails year round on seven-night cruises
from Dubai. For information, call Peter Deilmann Ocean Cruises at
800-348-8287.

on Sept. 17, calling on New England and Canadian ports. The
900-passenger Regal Empress will visit Newport, R.I.; Bar Harbor,
Maine; Quebec City, Quebec; Halifax, Nova Scotia; Charlottetown,
Prince Edward Island; and Corner Brook, Newfoundland. For

GAINING A DEGREE, LOSING A PREPOSITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jane Holden's recent e-mail was just the latest in a steady
trickle of inquiries about a disappearing preposition. ``Since
moving to the Boston area I have often noted that the word graduate
is used with a direct object,'' she writes _ as in ``he never
graduated college.'' Everywhere else, the phrase was graduated from
college, and Holden wonders if the from-free variant is a regional
quirk or a ``newer, hipper version.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous correspondents have posed the same question, sometimes
more forcefully. ``I was taught that a school graduates its
students and that colloquially and informally we may say that a
student graduated from a school,'' wrote Michael Malamut last fall,
wondering why the from was suddenly evaporating. For once, there is
a simple answer: To graduate college may be gaining ground, but it
has no defenders I can discover in the world of usage commentary.
Graduate from, however, is acceptable everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But of course there's more to the story. Half a century ago,
when I graduated college was elbowing its way into spoken English,
the language honchos were fighting a different battle over
graduate: whether it was properly used in the active voice at all.
During the first few centuries of graduation ceremonies, students
were graduated, passively, from their institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The first recorded instance of the student doing the graduating,
rather than having it done to him, dates to 1807 _ but the zealous
usagists of the later 19th-century language pounced on that form,
denouncing it loudly and sternly enough that Malamut's teacher,
among others, believed them. She graduated from college, however,
was eventually accepted as standard (not merely colloquial).
</P>
<P>
   Is she graduated college coasting in with the same ease? Well,
it is appearing more often in print than it did 25 years ago, and a
quick survey suggests that Holden's suspicion may be justified:
Newspapers in the Northeast seem more receptive to graduated
college. Sometimes it's in a quotation, but it also shows up in the
prose of well-educated writers, and not just the younger ones.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, other verbs have gone through more radical
transformations: Once upon a time a woman was delivered of a baby,
as in ``set free.'' Bergen and Cornelia Evans, in their 1957
Dictionary of Contemporary American Usage, approve of the still
controversial graduate from, but they won't budge on the
obstetrical question. ``Although it would seem that birth sets the
baby free even more than it does the mother, this hasn't been the
opinion of people old enough to talk about the matter. . . . it is
the mother, and not the child, who is delivered,'' they write. A
stork could always deliver a baby, but only in the past few decades
have we agreed that physicians and taxi drivers can deliver babies,
not just deliver mothers of babies.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's diagnose, still the subject of a mini-controversy
over whether it can be applied to a person. Although general usage
accepts ``My dog was diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive
disorder,'' a few people have insisted that only a disease, not a
person (or a dog) can be diagnosed. However, since this rule adds
nothing but excess verbiage _ ``He diagnosed my dog's affliction as
obsessive-compulsive disorder'' would be the approved form _ it's
had trouble attracting support among sensible people.
</P>
<P>
   And prepositions are just as variable as verbs _ arbitrary,
regional, inexplicable. We insist (so far) on graduating from
college, but some of us babysit for a child, while others babysit
the children and babysit for the parents, or whoever's paying. Some
dictionaries go one way, some the other _ though I have a hunch
that the disappearing for, like the fading from after graduate, is
a Northeastern phenomenon. (Babysit for was what they said in last
week's rerun of ``The West Wing,'' so it's surely not obsolete.)
</P>
<P>
   Stranger things have happened, languagewise, than dropping a
preposition; if our descendants still go to school in 2050, it may
be fine for them to say they've graduated college. But if you use
the phrase today, be warned: Some people will think you don't yet
deserve that degree.

UNLEASHING A SUPERCOMPUTER ON THE HUMAN GENOME

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The reigning ``world's fastest computer'' sits inside a lab just
east of San Francisco, a hockey-rink-sized machine named ASCI White
that spends its days simulating nuclear bomb blasts for the
goverment. This powerhouse can do 3.8 trillion calculations in a
single second, the equivalent of 50,000 desktop computers running
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   But, in a lab just north of New York City, such staggering
numbers get little more than a dismissive yawn. There, computer
architects for IBM are building the ``Next Big Thing'' in the world
of supercomputers. Blue Gene, designed to explore the intricacies
of human genetics, is expected to be 500 times faster than its West
Coast rival, also made by IBM.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our machine will make (ASCI White) look like a Palm Pilot,''
said Blue Gene's chief architect, Monty Denneau, referring to a
popular brand of pocket-sized electronic planners.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Gene is the most fantastic entry in the furiously growing
field of bioinformatics, where computing and biology merge to
unravel the genetic secrets at the heart of life. Already,
high-speed computers have been instrumental in mapping the 3
billion chemical letters in the human genome, the equivalent of a
100,000-page run-on sentence that contains all the operating
instructions for a human being.
</P>
<P>
   Computers will play an equally large role in deciphering the
sentence, specialists say. And understanding, in detail, how the
genetic process works will take Herculean computing power _ thus
Blue Gene.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to providing computer firepower for gene
exploration, the $100 million Blue Gene project is further proof
that post-genome medical research has taken a privileged place at
the top of the scientific heap. In years past, supercomputers were
primarily made for physics research, such as ASCI White's nuclear
simulations or showy demonstrations, such as Deep Blue's chess
games against top human opponents. Now, the DNA inside our cells
appears to be the target of choice.
</P>
<P>
   Denneau's team plans to run Blue Gene 24 hours a day for an
entire year to solve just one problem: How does a single protein
molecule form? Though it may sound esoteric, the question is
actually at the center of life because protein forms much of the
body and the chemicals that run it. DNA may be life's instructions,
but it's tens of thousands of different proteins that do all the
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of nature's most complex processes. And a very
important one,'' said Denneau, a former philosophy student and
accidental computer architect.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the goal of the DNA revolution is to understand and
manipulate what proteins do, paving the way for new medicines and
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Modern genomics would not exist without the recent leaps in
computing power. Mapping the genome was, more than anything, a
computing problem. It took an army of computers working for both
the government's Human Genome Project and the private Celera
Genomics to decipher and string together the millions of A's, C's,
G's and T's in the genetic code. Figuring out what they mean will
take even more silicon prowess.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of bioinformatics companies have emerged in the last year
to help researchers process, compare and analyze all the data
streaming from the genome mapping teams. Creating gene-based cures
for cancer, brain diseases and numerous other illnesses hinges on
this computer work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The human genome accomplishment is the product of a confluence
of biology, chemistry and computing,'' said Tony White, chief
executive officer of PE Corp., the parent company of Maryland-based
Celera.
</P>
<P>
   PE Biosystems Group created high-powered genome mapping
computers that _ when paired with robots that sequence genes _
allowed the once-unfathomable task to be completed in a few years.
The Human Genome Project, something of a competitor to Celera and
PE Corp., even bought some.
</P>
<P>
   Still, until now, the race for the world's fastest computer has
centered on the federal government's nuclear blast simulation
project, Accelerated Strategic Computing Initiative or ASCI.
</P>
<P>
   Intel upped the ante last year when it produced ASCI Red, which
broke the barrier of 1 trillion calculations per second. ASCI
White, formally unveiled earlier this month, is IBM's reply with a
speed of 3.8 trillion calculations per second. Blue Gene will do
one quadrillion calculations per second. (Translation: That's a one
followed by 15 zeros.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, there's a bit of competition. You want to beat the next
guy,'' Denneau said.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Gene's ancestor, Deep Blue, captured headlines in 1997 by
beating world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, at his own game.
Chess has its obvious complexity: All the different pieces moving
on an ever-changing board. But protein creation, with more than
30,000 atoms pushing on one another to give it shape, humbles the
64-square chess board.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the growing army of gene-hunting and drug development
companies don't need the supercomputer's help to go forward. But,
once Blue Gene solves its protein problem, researchers will be able
to visualize, at a very basic level, how life is created through
the interaction of DNA and protein.
</P>
<P>
   ``To understand how the body works, we're going to have to
understand how protein works,'' said Dr. Joel Habener, director of
molecular endocrinology at Massachusetts General Hospital, who
researches the genetic roots of diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   To simulate the birth of a protein, Blue Gene begins with
ultrafast processors capable of 1 billion operations per second.
Thirty-two of these will be crammed on a single computer chip; 64
of these chips will be put on one computer board. And Blue Gene
will come to life when 512 of these boards, with more than a
million chips, are linked.
</P>
<P>
   The supercomputer's genius lies in the novel and efficient way
all these chips will talk to each other. The communications system
is so powerful, it could download the entire contents of the
Internet, every Web page and e-mail, in a second. And, once Blue
Gene starts on the protein problem, the chips will have much to
talk about.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works: DNA is made of chemical bases _ adenine,
cytosine, guanine and thymine _ which researchers commonly refer to
by their initials, A, C, G and T. They are fed into each cell's
protein-making organ. For every three letters in, one amino acid
comes out. Three more, and another amino acid forms, until there is
a long chain of connected amino acids. This chain is protein, and
it's eventually cut loose to do its work.
</P>
<P>
   But the work a protein does depends on the amino acids it's made
of and what it looks like. The chain isn't long and straight. It's
all twisted like a crumpled ribbon. Blue Gene's task is to figure
out the shape of this crumpled atomic ribbon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem,'' Denneau said, ``is all these atoms are exerting
force on all the other atoms.''
</P>
<P>
   The average protein consists of about 300 amino acids, and some
have more than 1,000, making it an almost infinitely complex
molecule. There are more possible forms for a single average-sized
protein than there are atoms in the entire universe. (Translation _
a lot.)
</P>
<P>
   The twisted, folded shape of each protein determines how it
functions. Proteins bind with each other, causing crucial chemical
reactions and the creation of body tissue. They fit together like
lock and key. If a protein is folded incorrectly, because of a
single defect in the gene code, it may not fit into its proper
lock, depriving the body of an important function. This is how many
diseases are caused.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of research today is trial and error,'' said Habener of
MGH. ``If we knew the exact structure of a protein, we could
eliminate a lot of the guesswork.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue Gene was born in the intellectually fecund hallways of
IBM's research labs in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., where physicists and
biologists roam next to computer scientists _ with the
bean-counting business types off in another building. The idea of a
protein-modeling supercomputer was first raised in a chance hallway
encounter between a biologist and Denneau.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know who you'll run into,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the IBM lab has created numerous bomb simulators.
Then there was the supercomputer that confirmed the weight of the
proton, one of the tiny particles that make up matter. It took
seven years, then the computer was mothballed.
</P>
<P>
   More often, however, in the process of designing these computing
behemoths, researchers develop practical money-making technologies.
</P>
<P>
   With the intellectual heavy lifting for Blue Gene mostly done,
Denneau and his crew are already contemplating the next challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone told me just a few months ago, we're going to
understand all the metabolic pathways in a cell. We might try to
model the cell. That would be staggering,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one computer that continues to humble these
scientists _ the human brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe someday we'll model human intelligence,'' Denneau said.
``But right now we're just specks of sand in that regard.''

WHAT MAKES YOUR SKIN DARKEN WHEN YOU USE TANNING CREAMS?

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. How do artificial tanning products work? Are they just paint,
or what?
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  T. P., Boston
</P>
<P>
   A. There are several ways to simulate a tan without actually
exposing your skin to dangerous ultraviolet light. You can take
pills containing carotene and carotene-like compounds that will
lend your skin a bit of color, though you tend to come out looking
more orange than tanned. Some creams do contain dyes that simply
stain your skin. The most popular and effective tanning products
are creams containing dihydroxyacetone, a simple sugar that is
nontoxic, and that binds to amino acids in proteins in your skin to
form colored compounds called melanoidins.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction between sugars and proteins is called the Maillard
reaction, after a Frenchman who first described it in 1912. The
same reaction contributes to many of the interesting brown colors
in food, from the skin of a Christmas turkey to the golden brown
color of beer.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to note that the browning you get from a pill or
a tube of cream is not likely to protect you much from the sun, so
you still need to stay in the shade and use sun-block.

IN JERUSALEM, ENMITIES YIELDING TO A FRAGILE HOPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The spirit of reconciliation seems buried under the
weight of the Old City's ancient stones, which retain the scorching
summer heat here as the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim faithful
throng to their holy sites.
</P>
<P>
   But in the cool, antiseptic environs of the maternity ward at
Haddasah Hospital on Mount Scopus, the cries of newborns seemed to
awaken hope Monday that a solution can be found on the future of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In a city sharply divided by culture, politics, and religion,
and which both Palestinians and Israelis insist on as their
capital, the Hadassah maternity ward is one of few places where the
two sides seem intimately bound together, in this case by the joy
of birth. And to those here Monday the possibility that the
negotiators at Camp David could make a breakthrough on Jerusalem
did seem possible, even necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should be locked in a room and kept there until there is
an agreement, because what we have here is not a life,'' said Gary
Hughes, 40, an immigrant to Israel from England.
</P>
<P>
   He looked exhausted after helping his wife, Margolit, deliver
their daughter, Maya, who he boasted was ``our first ``sabra,'' the
Hebrew word for the tough little cactus that is used to describe
Jewish children born in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be an agreement, or there is no future for any
of these babies, whether they're Israeli or Palestinian,'' he said,
as Israeli and Palestinian women in pink bathrobes wheeled newborns
to and from the nursery.
</P>
<P>
   Hanadi Mustafa, 25, a Palestinian woman from the nearby village
of Isawiya, was cradling her new baby girl, who did not yet have a
name: ``There is a way for the leaders to agree, God willing. There
are extremists on both sides, but most people just want a better
future.''
</P>
<P>
   In the next two days, perhaps even before these mothers and
their newborns go home, the fate of Jerusalem could be determined.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp David, the Palestinian and Israeli leaders were said to
be working hard Monday on a series of proposals that could resolve
the rival claims to Jerusalem. The Israelis reportedly summoned
Reuven Merhav, a specialist on Jerusalem issues, from Israel. He
was expected to help map out a proposal to grant Palestinians rule
of East Jerusalem in exchange for grafting surrounding West Bank
settlements onto West Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   West Jerusalem is today predominantly Jewish. East Jerusalem and
the Old City, which were captured by Israel from Jordan in 1967,
are mainly Palestinian.
</P>
<P>
   In practical terms, the two sides live in deeply divided
communities. West Jerusalem is a modern city of secular and
religious Israelis who live amid shopping malls, clean boulevards,
parks with green grass, McDonald's restaurants, Blockbuster Video
stores, and Tower Records.
</P>
<P>
   East Jerusalem is a different story. Israeli police and army
units patrol intensively. But residents say municipal services in
Palestinian areas are badly neglected, while the Israeli government
pumps millions of dollars into expanding and improving Jewish
settlements around Palestinian neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the Palestinian areas of East Jerusalem are
already under the de facto control of Yasser Arafat's Palestinian
Authority. Palestinian plainclothes police work the streets and the
school curriculum is set by Palestinian educators. Palestinians
vote for their parliament and have their own representatives in the
Palestinian Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Seidemann, a Jerusalem lawyer and longtime peace
activist, said that at the Camp David negotiations, ``the point is
not to create something new, but to tell the truth about something
that already exists.''
</P>
<P>
   But Israel has long maintained that Jerusalem is its ``eternal
and indivisible'' capital, and the more hardline opposition, made
up largely of religious Jewish parties, is pressuring Prime
Minister Barak not to allow a divided city.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians claim that East Jerusalem was taken from them
during the 1967 war and, according to UN resolutions, must be
returned. They say East Jerusalem and the Old City are the rightful
place for the capital of an independent state that Arafat has vowed
to declare this fall, with or without an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   And so the two leaders at the Camp David summit, hosted by
President Clinton, are struggling to find a way to share control of
a city coveted through the ages.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem could make or break a peace deal at Camp David. An
agreement on Jerusalem could end 52 years of Arab-Israeli conflict
and open the way for other tough issues to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to agree on Jerusalem could undermine diligent efforts
on other fronts, and possibly reignite violence. Other issues
include the final borders between Israel and those parts of the
West Bank that will fall under Palestinian rule, as well as the
fate of 3 million Palestinian refugees uprooted by wars in 1948 and
1967.
</P>
<P>
   To understand just how powerfully emotional is the battle for
Jerusalem, enter Damascus Gate and walk the cobblestones of El Wad
Street in the Old City, with its Ottoman-era walls and its ancient
warren of streets and alleys.
</P>
<P>
   The narrow, winding street is a melange of smells of spice and
Turkish coffee and a mix of sounds of the Muslim call to prayer, of
church bells, of the crackling of Israeli soldiers' radios, and
blaring Arab pop music.
</P>
<P>
   El Wad skirts the ``Via Dolorosa'' where Jesus is believed to
have carried the cross, then winds its way to the entrance to the
plaza of the Western Wall, the holiest site in Judaism and all that
remains of the Second Temple destroyed by Romans in the year 70
A.D. It also leads to the passage that brings Muslims to the Dome
of the Rock, where tradition holds that the prophet Mohammed
ascended to heaven. Muslims call the raised 35-acre space where the
golden dome shimmers by the name al-Haram al Sharif. Jews call it
the Temple Mount, and under it are the remains of the destroyed
temples.
</P>
<P>
   Chaim Yishai, 24, a Jewish settler with a knitted kippah on his
head and a pistol strapped to his waist, rushed for prayers at the
Western Wall Monday, saying, ``Just open the Bible and read, this
city was always Jewish. For 2,000 years we dreamed of returning,
and we prayed. Why should we give an inch, and why should we give
up the dream of rebuilding the Temple?''
</P>
<P>
   Along the same path, Hassan Abu Zneid, 40, was heading to his
job as a guard at the Dome of the Rock. ``If the Jews ever try to
lay a finger on our mosque, there will be war,'' he warned. ``This
is a place for all three religions, but East Jerusalem and the Old
City are Palestinian. It must be under Palestinian rule or there
will be violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Minister of Justice Yossi Beilen, an architect of the
1993 Israeli-Palestinian accord at Oslo, said a solution on the
future of Jerusalem, which may be the most intractable problem the
two sides face, could open the door to solving all other issues.
</P>
<P>
   That, analysts here suggest, is why Clinton has pushed Barak and
Arafat to begin the negotiations with the Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we solve Jerusalem, we can show we can solve the other
problems,'' said Beilen in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem's mayor, Ehud Olmert, a member of the conservative
opposition Likud Party, vehemently disagrees, and he joined some
150,000 demonstrators in Tel Aviv to make their point clear to
Barak, who faces a domestic political crisis upon his return, with
or without an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerusalem is the heart of Jewish existence,'' said Olmert.
``It is not a heart to Muslims or to Christians.''
</P>
<P>
   Illustrating with maps of Jewish and Palestinian populations in
the east and west sides of the city as he spoke in his office,
Olmert dismissed proposals for shared rule of Jerusalem as ``not a
solution, but a prescription for almost endless conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a half-mile down the road, across what was the ``no man's
land'' separating the two sides of Jerusalem between the wars of
1948 and 1967, is Orient House in East Jerusalem, which has become
the focal point for the Palestinian leadership and administration.
Faisal Husseini, the Palestinian official responsible for Jerusalem
affairs, held a town meeting last week, where Muslim and Christian
clerics and community leaders gathered to express the intense
feeling in the streets that there can be no peace without
Palestinian control of East Jerusalem as it existed before the 1967
war.
</P>
<P>
   That is ``clearly what is called for in Resolution 242,'' said
Husseini, referring to the UN Security council's action. The
Israeli-Palestinian ``Declaration of Principles'' signed on the
White House lawn on Sept. 13, 1993, he went on, says that ``the
negotiations on permanent status will lead to the implementation of
Security Council Resolution 242,'' approved in 1967 and ordered the
withdrawal of Israeli troops from occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the emotion on both sides, the Israeli-funded Hadassah
Hospital that is among the more advanced medical care facilities in
the world, stands as a practical, modern reality, perhaps even a
model of coexistence in which it seems possible to see Palestinians
and Israelis learning to live together.
</P>
<P>
   The staff is mostly Israeli, but there are Palestinian doctors
and nurses as well. The patients are a mix, people struggling with
illness and rejoicing in birth in side-by-side beds.
</P>
<P>
   George Moshe, 60, an Iranian-born Jew who works as a security
guard in the Israeli parliament and became a grandfather Monday,
spoke there with the wisdom of age: ``When my daughter was born, we
hoped she would never go to the army. Now she has a baby, and we
find ourselves hoping again. Every generation wants it to be better
for the next, and we hope our leaders know that.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ That there were men in chic white suits wearing Gucci
flip-flops and pink-lensed sunglasses in the audience at a fashion
show was not surprising. But this fall collection, on display at
the Chelsea Piers last week, belonged to Target, the
Minneapolis-based department store with a reputation for selling
all things middle America, from outdoor grills to boxer shorts.
</P>
<P>
   So the relative hipness of the event was all the more
remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old retailer, with a superstore in every major
American city except New York, is conducting a major Northeast
expansion spree. At the same time, the company has launched a campy
branding campaign, using lighthearted '60s music and a
red-and-white bull's-eye logo designed to lure a new spectrum of
buyers to its huge stores.
</P>
<P>
   John Remington, the company's vice president for special events,
opened this show by declaring that the retailer is ``on a mission
to democratize fashion'' by making clothing designers and trends
accessible and affordable.
</P>
<P>
   While Target has succeeded in winning over fans for its home
furnishings from such designers as Starck and Michael Graves _ both
of whom are new to the store, with Stark poised to roll out a full
line next year _ its fashion offerings have had less impact.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what the Chelsea show was all about: Creating a buzz,
encouraging fashionistas _ some of whom cheekily call the store
Tar-ZHAY _ to appreciate the store's clothing in a more glamorous
light, and showcasing the company's self-effacing approach and
quirky marketing linking household commodities to clothing. To wit:
one model wore pants covered with the Ziploc baggie logo. Target
sells the Ziplocs, not the pants, which drew the loudest applause
of the 10-minute show.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we try to do is include models who are kind of like our
guests. Some are older. Some are younger,'' said Target spokeswoman
Carolyn Brookter. ``This year, even as we look at our fashion, it
runs the gamut from New Age western to luxury, with leather. And
then there's the woman who's on the go: travel fashion. That tends
sometimes to be an older'' market.
</P>
<P>
   A blondish-gray-haired female model just past middle age also
got some clapping for standing out as an unusual specimen amid her
lithe colleagues as she strode out in a khaki skirt and vest, cut
just the right way so as not to be frumpy. But pausing before a
relatively small bank of photographers, the younger models who
circled the oversized bull's-eye-shaped stage seemed almost
embarrassed to be there.
</P>
<P>
   The only color in the room came from the clothes and those
red-and-white concentric circles in the center of the floor.
Everything else in the cavernous showroom was black: the walls, the
ceiling, and the folding chairs for 600.
</P>
<P>
   The show's first round consisted of black and gray nylon pants
and vests boasting an urban/high-tech feel, with lots of pockets,
which were paired with clingy ribbed turtleneck and zip-front
sweaters. A pale blue scarf of stuffed nylon drew murmurs from the
appreciative crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The next grouping featured a hippie theme, with tie-dye shirts,
knit hats, and knee-length rayon print skirts. In the midst of the
parade came the unexpected _ a skirt with an all-over Meow Mix logo
and a matching kerchief on the model's head. The skirt and scarf
were made just for the show, with a wink to fall's emphasis on
animal prints and to Target's pet department.
</P>
<P>
   A sharp-jawed male model looked slick in his black flat-front
pants and silky T-shirt, which sported an all-over print of Mr.
Clean's face; household supplies, you see, are another selling
point for the store.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the Western motif: denim cropped jeans and
skirts, chambray jackets, cowboy hats, and suede bags with fringe,
as well as animal-print accessories and snake skin-style pants.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, the crowd applauded, then bolted for the exits
in a mad dash to secure cabs. In the crush, one man said in a stage
whisper to a friend, ``There was some interesting stuff. But
nothing I'd buy myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the show ended abruptly, the buildup began two hours
earlier with a themed cocktail party just outside the event room.
</P>
<P>
   Waiters dressed in white shirts, black pants, and aprons covered
in the Meow Mix, Cheer, and Puffs logos, as they collected party
detritus on silver platters and doled out delicacies on sleek black
servers. The floral arrangements contained white ``flowers'' made
of tissue (Puffs, to be exact).
</P>
<P>
   The crowd, meanwhile, was reading the fine print on a Pop-art
installation billed as Warhol-esque. In one instance, instead of
using tomato soup cans, an artist assembled boxes of dry cat food
(yes, Meow Mix) to create a ``cat space mobile.''
</P>
<P>
   Large, target-shaped cushions were strewn here and there in the
room so the weary could rest their stiletto-pained feet. Outside,
on the deck overlooking the East River, sat a Jolly Rancher-shaped
cushion, wrapped in plastic just like the hard candies sold at the
store. Tie-in: the Western-inspired denim clothing and cowboy hats.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the red-haired woman whose accessories included a
pet Pomeranian and a Louis Vuitton bag. She _ and her dog _ mingled
over cocktails. But both actually stayed to see the fashions, as
did Sasha Charnin Morrison, fashion market director at Allure
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that each category was pretty strong,'' Morrison
said of the clothes. ``I think it's stuff that you want.''

GOP'S ABORTION WRANGLE BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; _ Trent Lott says flat out that George W. Bush
will pick a right-to-life politician as his running mate, probably
in about a week.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: The Senate's majority leader is disguising a strong
recommendation as a prediction, giving more prominent voice to the
views of many conservatives that abortion is the kind of issue that
does not permit the ultimate form of ticket splitting.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan is saying that Governor Bush doesn't have the nerve
to pick a prochoice running mate, such as Pennsylvania Governor Tom
Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: The wily coyote is trying to goad Bush into picking
Ridge, an act that in addition to the turmoil it would generate in
the GOP world would also help give some right-to-life juice to
Buchanan's Reform Party candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-Ridge Republicans, meanwhile, have gone to ground in the
face of the conservatives' negative onslaught. Bush himself tries
to be nice to his pal in public, but even that effort is starting
to appear forced, and his meeting with prochoice Governor George
Pataki of New York last week had the stench of bone-tossing
symbolism.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: As the prochoice forces prepare themselves for
another loss on the GOP platform, there is simply no sign that Bush
is willing to take on the party's religious right.
</P>
<P>
   The overall meaning of the latest tea leaf events is that
because the countdown to the GOP convention has begun, and because
the veep selection is imminent, the wrestling match with abortion
rights has begun. It is one of the principal table-settings for the
convention itself because both the veep and the platform will be
the news events before the convention opens.
</P>
<P>
   The fact remains that no prochoice Republican has come within an
inch of the vice presidency in the 20 years since the bizarre
events in Detroit when Ronald Reagan picked Bush's father. The
elder Bush went from prochoice to right-to-life on the spot, never
explained himself, and never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of how much damage this position has done since 1988 to
the party's relationship with many female voters, Governor Bush has
spent a year trying to downplay a right-to-life orthodoxy that
cannot be denied. Bush can go for weeks without mentioning
abortion. He usually tries to mask his position with a detour onto
his opposition to partial-birth abortion, a stance that lost its
legitimacy after last month's 5-4 Supreme Court decision
overturning legislative efforts to shatter certain Roe v. Wade
constitutional guarantees. Because it was a one-vote margin,
prochoice voters know that the fundamentals of the right to choose
hang by a thread.
</P>
<P>
   You can now explain it in 30 seconds, says Democratic pollster
Geoffrey Garin, who does research for the Center for Reproductive
Law and Policy, whose president, Janet Benshoof, was the cocounsel
in last month's Nebraska decision. There is now an opportunity to
speak to prochoice Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Between the oral arguments at the Supreme Court and the actual
decision, Garin convened focus groups in two important, swing voter
locales _ Long Island and northern Virginia _ exposing the
discussants to longer newspaper articles summarizing the oral
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Garin's voters, he said, all concluded they had been had by the
right-to-life movement's five-year campaign and concluded to a
person that the Nebraska law was wrong. Until their exposure to
facts, they had to varying degrees bought into the propaganda that
partial-birth abortioninvolved the killingof a babythat was almost
ready to be born.
</P>
<P>
   What was clear from the argument was that all nine justices saw
the Nebraska statute as involving the basic meaning of Roe v. Wade
itself. The voters changed markedly as they discovered that the law
in fact covered more than one procedure that is used before fetuses
are viable, that the political phrase had no medical meaning, that
it made no provision for either a pregnant woman's health or the
presence of a severely deformed fetus. In effect, Garin said they
saw the statute as a sneak attackon Roe and that it awakened their
sense that this was the last arena in which government should be
involved.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a new political opinion. In recent years,
right-to-lifers made three stabs at subverting Roe via state
referendums on partial-birth abortionin the disparate environments
of Maine, Colorado, and Washington state. Each one of them lost
after more thorough debates.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the issue needs more elevated discussion.
Republicans are already nervous about the double-impact of a
prolife veep and approval of another right-to-life platform plank.
</P>
<P>
   The prochoice community needs to respond to the nervousness by
raising the profile of abortion rights, not just in Al Gore's
campaign but in tight Senate races like those in Missouri, New
York, Virginia, Michigan, and even a longer shot like Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The right to choose really does hang by a thread, and George W.
Bush really is committed to ending it.

 HARVARD PROFESSOR TRIES TO HELP GORE RUN IN THE CENTER

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ As Al Gore's campaign policy director, Elaine
Kamarck has had to get awfully good at saying no.
</P>
<P>
   As in, no to a big-money universal health care plan; no to
privatizing Social Security, and no to the policy geeks arguing
over block grants versus challenge grants.
</P>
<P>
   One of the original architects of the New Democrats, a movement
in which Gore has long been a leader, Kamarck has regularly found
herself defending the centrist in Gore against the expansive
temptations of the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there are times the political people think I'm a
fuddy-duddy old professor and times the policy people think I'm
just a whore,'' said Kamarck, in her typically blunt fashion.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran of the Jimmy Carter, Walter Mondale, and Bruce Babbitt
presidential campaigns, Kamarck, a Harvard University professor,
oversees and distills the advice of an unwieldy platoon of policy
specialists from coast to coast, as well as in the White House and
on Capitol Hill. She also finds herself occasionally butting heads
with the political consultants focused more on strategy than the
substance of governing, as Texas Governor George W. Bush moves to
the political center.
</P>
<P>
   Kamarck's success in tailoring Gore's policy views reflects her
long working relationship with the vice president and her keen
understanding of how his mind works. But she is hardly without
rivals for the candidate's ear, and her occasional battles within
the campaign for policy primacy provide a window on how Gore
prefers to make decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Gore believes in creative tension among his advisers, refereeing
the clashing views of various aides. He does not like to invest any
one person with the power to control how information gets to him
and how his options are framed.
</P>
<P>
   That can complicate life for Kamarck. For example, while
preparing Gore's health care plan during the primaries, she
discovered that campaign image-meisters Carter Eskew and Robert
Shrum were secretly preparing an alternative speech in which the
vice president would call for universal health care immediately,
eschewing Kamarck's incremental approach to that goal.
</P>
<P>
   Kamarck, alarmed, went directly to Gore, and Gore chose to stick
with the go-slow approach despite concerns that Bill Bradley's more
sweeping health care initiative might be more appealing to
Democratic primary voters. But the vice president did tell his
aides to find a way for him to insure every child right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very proud we got through the primaries as a New
Democrat,'' said Kamarck. ``Gore was able to win the support of the
AFL-CIO without changing his position on trade, and he got the
support of the teachers despite calling for accountability, teacher
testing, and (curbs on) tenure.''
</P>
<P>
   Another time, as Gore was preparing to go to Boston to deliver a
foreign policy address, Kamarck found that much of the substantive
discussion about the need for Western investments in sub-Saharan
Africa had been dropped in favor of what she considered meaningless
political rhetoric. Sources said Kamarck, Leon Fuerth, Gore's
national security adviser, and the political consultants were all
doing battle over what Gore should say, how he should say it, and
whose written draft he should work from.
</P>
<P>
   The night before he was to deliver his speech to the
International Press Institute's World Congress, Gore, on Air Force
Two, sifted through his advisers' recommendations and wrote the
speech himself, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   As one of only two high-powered women in a thoroughly
male-dominated campaign, Kamarck is frequently described by her
colleagues as having a potent personality that can rub some the
wrong way. But she can also be warm and effusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is one of those people who understands the importance of
ideas in politics,'' said Al From, president of the centrist
oriented Democratic Leadership Council. ``In the Gore campaign, she
has to go through a lot of battles. Most of those consultants don't
have the appreciation for ideas that she has.''
</P>
<P>
   During a recent trip to Nashville, Gore met with Kamarck and
asked her to explore a half-dozen ideas he wanted to learn more
about. In Memphis the next day, Gore met again with Kamarck, as
well as with Fuerth, to talk about defense policy for his
commencement address at West Point.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, when Gore was campaigning in New Hampshire, Kamarck
frequently drove from Boston to meet him. During the long motorcade
rides from one campaign event to another, Kamarck and Gore would
talk about pension reform and other hot topics. Now that he is
crisscrossing the country, Kamarck and Gore frequently communicate
by fax and conference call, or she meets him in the city du jour.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president has placed a lot of trust in Elaine in the
policy arena,'' said Eskew, who is responsible for crafting Gore's
campaign message.
</P>
<P>
   Kamarck, who is on leave from the Kennedy School of Government
until the end of the year, said she views her job as protecting the
integrity of the policies that Gore adopts, which sometimes means
she has to be on the lookout for end-runs by advisers with other
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I catch them every time,'' said Kamarck. ``Nothing gets by
me.''
</P>
<P>
   She is also responsible for assembling the right specialists to
shape proposals and help Gore make decisions. She keeps track of
the total cost of all his proposals, and she says she tries to stop
political lingo from swamping substance.
</P>
<P>
   If defending the New Democrat core of Gore means showing up
uninvited for debate prep sessions with the candidate, Kamarck has
done that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make sure he knows what he needs to know,'' she said.

   Elaine Ciulla Kamarck, 49, grew up in Rochester, N.Y., the
Italian-American daughter of staunch Democrats. Her career in
politics began early while she was researching her dissertation on
how state primary election rules affect presidential strategy.
</P>
<P>
   During the Carter campaign, Kamarck served as the resident rules
specialist at the Democratic National Committee, where she ran the
rules fight and the platform fight against Senator Edward M.
Kennedy, Carter's primary opponent. For Mondale, Kamarck was the
chief delegate counter. And for Babbitt, Kamarck worked as the
deputy campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   But it was during Mondale's campaign that Kamarck began to
realize that the Democratic Party needed to change. As Mondale
appealed to every traditional voting group, from labor unions to
minority groups to teachers, voters walked away in droves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played to every constituency and we lost everything,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Kamarck's Italian immigrant relatives _ many of them
members of labor unions _ were turned off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ethnics were leaving the party saying, `Bye-bye, you don't
speak for us,' '' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   By 1989, Kamarck had signed on as a visiting scholar at the
Democratic Leadership Council's think tank, the Progressive Policy
Institute. She and William A. Galston, a professor at the
University of Maryland, coauthored what became a groundbreaking
examination of why Democrats couldn't seem to win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Politics of Evasion'' pointed out that Americans viewed
the Democratic Party as ``inattentive to their economic interests,
indifferent if not hostile to their moral sentiments and
ineffective in defense of their national security.'' Using polling
data, Kamarck and Galston discredited the notion that candidates
who lost were just not liberal enough.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction among many Democrats was angry and intense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was scary,'' said Kamarck. ``It was frightening. We had
just given the Democratic Party a cold shower and they didn't like
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the manifesto became ``the bible for the Clinton
campaign,'' said From, the Democratic Leadership Council president.
</P>
<P>
   Then-Governor Bill Clinton asked Kamarck to serve as his
presidential campaign manager. But that was one campaign that
Kamarck, who was living in New York at the time, decided she had to
skip. Her three children were young and in school. She could not
justify moving them to Arkansas, and she could not imagine
commuting between home and campaign headquarters, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the hardest conversations I ever had,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Kamarck's absence from the political arena was short-lived.
Once Clinton and Gore were elected, Kamarck was brought on board as
Gore's main policy adviser. Not long after that, she was given
principal responsibility for running the administration's
``Reinventing Government'' effort.
</P>
<P>
   When her husband, Martin Kamarck, took a job in Boston, Kamarck
left the administration for a teaching post at Harvard. Still, she
continued advising Gore.
</P>
<P>
   So when the time came for Gore to make his own bid for the White
House, it seemed only natural that he would have Elaine Kamarck at
his side.

IT'S ANNE VS. EMILY ON PEI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Look out, Anne of Green Gables: There's a new girl in town, and
her name is Emily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emily,'' a musical about a troubled Prince Edward Island girl,
is drawing crowds at the Confederation Centre of the Arts in the
island capital of Charlottetown. And ``Emily of New Moon'' is an
award-winning television series that can now be seen in the United
States on some cable/satellite channels such as Movieplex.
</P>
<P>
   Both the musical and TV show are based upon a trio of novels by
Lucy Maud Montgomery, who also wrote ``Anne of Green Gables,'' a
book that will forever be associated with the late author's beloved
Prince Edward Island. For years, souvenirs of red-haired, pigtailed
Anne have saturated the island, and the Green Gables homestead is
something of a shrine. But nowadays mementos of dark-haired Emily
have wended their way into PEI souvenir shops _ even the one at
Green Gables. When the TV series began filming on the island, it
was a major topic of conversation. A cartoon in a local newspaper
went so far as to depict Anne on a psychiatrist's couch, lamenting,
``It's Emily this and Emily that!'' This summer, the ``Emily''
musical will play for its second year at the Confederation Centre,
and the acclaimed ``Anne of Green Gables'' will enter its 36th
season, making it Canada's longest-running musical.
</P>
<P>
   While both the Anne and the Emily stories concern an orphaned
girl growing up on the island in the early years of the 20th
century, the tales are hardly the same. For one thing, the first
Emily book was written about 15 years after ``Anne of Green
Gables,'' is more autobiographical, and reflects Montgomery's
increasing maturity. If ``Anne'' is a story told in pastels,
``Emily'' is related in richer, occasionally darker hues, making
for more compelling drama. While the Anne musical bubbles brightly
from the start, Emily's begins with the death of her father and her
upbringing by a stern, outwardly cold aunt. All is not gloom,
though: There is a lot of hope and humor _ and good songs, too.
</P>
<P>
   But if musicals about the plight of young island girls don't
call out to you, fret not: All summer long, Prince Edward Island is
a festival of plays, concerts, dinner theater, jazz, blues, art and
museum exhibits, and Highland and Celtic music and gatherings.
Under the auspices of the Confederation Centre alone are such
productions as the laugh-a-lot musical ``Forever Plaid''; the
ultra-energetic ``Barachois,'' with Acadian music, dancing, and
comedy; ``the Conjuror's Suite,'' a re-creation of an old-time
magic show; ``Celidh on the Road,'' featuring Celtic music, song,
and dance; ``Somewhere in the World,'' a rousing _ and free _
outdoor musical salute to Canada; and ``Drill Queens Comedy,''
featuring sketches, impersonations, and satirical melodies. Why,
one sketch even has a slightly tipsy Anne confronting Emily: ``For
36 seasons, I've owned this town. . . . And now, when I look in the
rear-view mirror, who do I see? You!''
</P>

 &QL; 
Travel Trivia: Prince Edward Island is shaped like (a) a dagger,
(b) a crescent, (c) a figure-eight, or (d) a pair of pigtails?
(Answer at end of column.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a name: PEI may be the island of Anne of Green Gables, but
there's a restaurant/bike-rental shop in the town of St. Peters
called Anne of Red Doors. The building is a former fire station _
thus the red doors _ and the proprietor is named Anne. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quotable: ``The fairest land 'tis possible to see'' _ explorer
Jacques Cartier, after his first view of the reds and greens of
Prince Edward Island from his ship in 1534. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Snappy slogan: A message on a Prince Edward Island T-shirt reads,
``Boil a Tourist, Save a Lobster.'' (Lobster suppers are one of the
island's big draws.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Sound familiar? On PEI, you can find communities named Alaska,
Arlington, Albany, New Haven, Cambridge, Newton, and Springfield. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The flavor is locked in: An early 20th-century county jail in
Longworth, Prince Edward Island, is now a pizza palace. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Did you guess it? A crescent. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The answer to last week's Travel Trivia question was woefully
incomplete. In addition to Rhode Island having a one-word state
motto (Hope), as we mentioned, these states also have one-word
mottoes: California (Eureka), Maine (``Dirigo,'' meaning ``I
lead''), New York (Excelsior), Texas (Friendship), Utah (Industry),
Washington (``Al-ki,'' an Indian word meaning ``by and by''), and
Wisconsin (Forward). &QL;

   BOLSHOI-DANCERS (New York) _ Svetlana Lunkina and Maria
Alexandrova are the darlings of ballet critics in Russia and in
England. They have a faunlike delicacy that suggests they might
break if touched. But as the two young Bolshoi Ballet stars talked
in New York, it quickly became apparent that underneath that

<P>
   NY-HARLEM-GALLERY (New York) _ In the fall of 1998, Christian
Haye, a New York poet and art critic, opened a gallery of
contemporary art. He called it The Project and presented an
impressive lineup of artists from the Americas, Europe, Africa and
Asia. But if prime location is everything for a start-up venture,
there was a potential handicap. The gallery wasn't situated within
Manhattan's carefully defined downtown art geography. It was in a
former disco on West 126th Street in Harlem. But Haye has turned
being out-of-the-way into a mark of distinction. By Holland Cotter.

repeat from 1999 presented by big-name conductors and directors,
while its sold-out houses visibly sparkle with European elites. By
Alan Riding.

<P>
   JAMES-DEAN-FILM (Undated) _ For years, film studios have toyed
with projects about James Dean but were locked in a Catch-22:
studios would only finance the movie with a star _ or at least a
name actor. But these actors shied away from playing the 1950s
icon. Now, a film, called ``James Dean: An Invented Life,'' is in
production in Los Angeles, and will be shown next year. By Bernard
Weinraub.

   PAPERS-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Readers of Andre Aciman's earlier
work will not be surprised by the rapture over the personal past in
his new book of essays, ``False Papers: Essays on Exile and
Memory.'' In ``Out of Egypt,'' Aciman searched his memory for the
city of Alexandria, Egypt, where he spent his childhood, and this
new book is a sort of sequel to the earlier one. Reviewed by
Richard Bernstein.

limitations on flavors; they can be summer fruits like peaches,
blackberries and nectarines, or spices, chocolate, herbs or

   OLYMPICS-SYDNEY _ SYDNEY, Australia _ It's Friday night, and the
musky aroma of Australian manhood saturates the Oaks, a pub on the
north side of Sydney Harbour that's as big as a Wal-Mart. Mobs of
men are standing around talking rugby over schooners of beer. Some
are furiously working the slot machines everyone calls ``pokies.''
Others are charring slabs of meat on a barbecue pit out in the
courtyard. There's something odd about the round table by the door.
Not only does it include several women _ eating pizza no less _ but
some of their accents sound rather alien. ``I remember when I left
Atlanta,'' one of them says, ``my mover asked, `What's the deal
with Sydney? It seems like we've been moving everyone to Sydney.'''
The deal with Sydney, of course, is the Olympics. Four years ago
tonight, Muhammad Ali lit the caldron that signaled Atlanta's star
turn on the world stage. For some Atlantans, it wasn't enough. At
least 200 veterans of the 1996 Games have moved on to Australia to
be part of the first Olympics of the new millennium. (Auchmutey,

   Entertainment and culture stories from The N.Y. Times News
Service for Wednesday, July 19.
</P>
<P>
   BOLSHOI-DANCERS (New York) _ Svetlana Lunkina and Maria
Alexandrova are the darlings of ballet critics in Russia and in
England. They have a faunlike delicacy that suggests they might
break if touched. But as the two young Bolshoi Ballet stars talked
in New York, it quickly became apparent that underneath that
fragility lay strong wills and even stronger senses of self. By
Jennifer Dunning.
</P>
<P>
   NY-HARLEM-GALLERY (New York) _ In the fall of 1998, Christian
Haye, a New York poet and art critic, opened a gallery of
contemporary art. He called it The Project and presented an
impressive lineup of artists from the Americas, Europe, Africa and
Asia. But if prime location is everything for a start-up venture,
there was a potential handicap. The gallery wasn't situated within
Manhattan's carefully defined downtown art geography. It was in a
former disco on West 126th Street in Harlem. But Haye has turned
being out-of-the-way into a mark of distinction. By Holland Cotter.
</P>
<P>
   KAISER-KENNEDY-CENTER (Undated) _ Michael Kaiser, the American
who helped rescue London's Royal Opera House from its financial
crisis and internal feuding, is to be named Wednesday as president
of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. By Irvin Molotsky.
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE-OPERA-FESTIVAL (Aix-en-Provence) _ Things have been going
well for the international opera festival of Aix-en-Provence since
it underwent a management shake-up in 1998. This year's festival,
which runs through July 28, includes four new productions and a
repeat from 1999 presented by big-name conductors and directors,
while its sold-out houses visibly sparkle with European elites. By
Alan Riding.
</P>
<P>
   JAMES-DEAN-FILM (Undated) _ For years, film studios have toyed
with projects about James Dean but were locked in a Catch-22:
studios would finance the movie only with a star _ or at least a
name actor. But these actors shied away from playing the 1950s
icon. Now, a film, called ``James Dean: An Invented Life,'' is in
production in Los Angeles, and will be shown next year. By Bernard
Weinraub.
</P>
<P>
   PAPERS-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Readers of Andre Aciman's earlier
work will not be surprised by this rapture over the personal past
in his new book of essays, ``False Papers: Essays on Exile and
Memory.'' In ``Out of Egypt,'' Aciman searched his memory for the
city of Alexandria, Egypt, where he spent his childhood, and this
new book is a sort of sequel to the earlier one. Reviewed by
Richard Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   MISSISSIPPI-TV-REVIEW (Undated) _ Almost every-other Wednesday
night at 11, through the end of the year, weather disaster buffs
can have a nightcap of typhoons, hurricanes, avalanches and floods.
The History Channel series begins Wednesday with ``Mississippi:
River out of Control,'' about the terrible flood of 1927 that
killed between 500 and 1,000 people and left almost 1 million more
homeless. By Julie Salamon.

Wednesday, July 19:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FEATURES: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   RESERVATION-LIES (New York) _ During the last year or so,
restaurateurs all over the city say that lying about reservations
has spiraled out of control. People want what they want when they
want it, and, well, if they didn't plan in advance, they're just
going to show up and demand it. By Alex Witchel.
</P>
<P>
   COOKING-LAVENDER (New York) _ In Provence, lavender is used
mostly for its fragrance. But in New York, far from the capital of
this redolent crop, a strange thing happened when farmers started
selling lavender. People started cooking with it. By Florence
Fabricant.
</P>
<P>
   MEAT-LABELS (Undated) _ Nutrition labeling is mandatory for
virtually every food but fresh meat and poultry because those
products are regulated by the Department of Agriculture. Meat and
poultry producers may soon have to provide the same nutritional
information as other food producers. By Marian Burros.
</P>
<P>
   GARLIC-FARMERS (Undated) _ Ray Bradley, one of about 20 farmers
selling new garlic at New York City's Greenmarkets, came to farming
through haute cuisine's back door, as a chef in some of the city's
top restaurants. By Deborah Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
   OLIVE-OILS (Undated) _ In a world awash in olive oil, it is hard
to imagine a new one that could merit singling out. But several
olive oils, and one innovative grapeseed oil, are worthy of the
attention of the serious cook. By Florence Fabricant.
</P>
<P>
   SORBET (Undated) _ A good sorbet should taste like an extraction
of its main flavor, and nothing else. There are almost no
limitations on flavors; they can be summer fruits like peaches,
blackberries and nectarines, or spices, chocolate, herbs or
spirits. Some chefs have recently taken to making almost-ice-cream
sorbets with fromage blanc, sour cream or even goat cheese. All of
them are able to stand out without compromise. By Amanda Hesser.

   OLYMPICS-SYDNEY _ SYDNEY, Australia _ It's Friday night, and the
musky aroma of Australian manhood saturates the Oaks, a pub on the
north side of Sydney Harbour that's as big as a Wal-Mart. Mobs of
men are standing around talking rugby over schooners of beer. Some
are furiously working the slot machines everyone calls ``pokies.''
Others are charring slabs of meat on a barbecue pit out in the
courtyard. There's something odd about the round table by the door.
Not only does it include several women _ eating pizza no less _ but
some of their accents sound rather alien. ``I remember when I left
Atlanta,'' one of them says, ``my mover asked, `What's the deal
with Sydney? It seems like we've been moving everyone to Sydney.'''
The deal with Sydney, of course, is the Olympics. Four years ago
tonight, Muhammad Ali lit the caldron that signaled Atlanta's star
turn on the world stage. For some Atlantans, it wasn't enough. At
least 200 veterans of the 1996 Games have moved on to Australia to
be part of the first Olympics of the new millennium. (Auchmutey,

   LONDON _ Take a walk in Brixton.
</P>
<P>
   Four miles from the gray postcard propriety of Westminster,
Brixton is a riot of noise and color.
</P>
<P>
   It pulsates with hefty bass riffs and reggae rhythms dancing
from knee-high speakers on the sidewalks outside CD stores and
appliance shops. In the borough's lively street market, you hear
the melodious sounds of Yoruba, Shona, Arabic, Spanish _
occasionally even English.
</P>
<P>
   The market's shops and stalls offer London's best Afro-Caribbean
and African fare _ plantains, caramel-colored smoked fish,
thermo-nuclear peri-peri sauce and yams. The air smells of scorched
coffee, limes and coriander.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, bright red double-decker busses _ the symbols
of familiar London seem drab in Brixton _ pass through, a reminder
that the heart of the Anglo-Saxon universe is a 10-minute commute.
</P>
<P>
   No less than Parliament House with Big Ben and Churchill's
statue, however, Brixton now is a part of the fiber of modern
London, a city rapidly being redefined by its ethnic variety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Multiracial London is coming of age, and it is this that is
igniting such energy, buzz and creativity,'' wrote Yasmin
Alibhair-Brown, a columnist for the Independent newspaper and
author of Who Do We Think We Are: Imagining the New Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation started at the end of World War II, when
Britain began accepting a substantial number of immigrants from
countries that for the most part had been colonies.
</P>
<P>
   Most settled in London's boroughs. Today, nearly 25 percent of
Londoners are from non-white minorities. In boroughs such as
Brixton, the percentage of non-whites is 40 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   Cedric Wilson, a Brixton resident, came to London in 1952 from
Spanish Town in the hills above Kingston, Jamaica. Wilson, an
electrician, has raised children and now grandchildren in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still Jamaican,'' he says, buying a pair of fresh chickens
for his wife to grill. ``But these young ones, they are Londoners _
not Englishmen, mind you, but Londoners.''
</P>
<P>
   People here insist that London is no melting pot, as immigrants
don't shed their cultural identities in the process of
manufacturing a new one. Nor is London seen as a multicultural
mosaic on the order of Toronto or Chicago, which have ancient,
separate and sheltered ethnic neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   In London, things are more fluid. With notable exceptions, few
neighborhoods could be called ``Little Delhi,'' ``Little Jamaica,''
or ``Little Lagos.''
</P>
<P>
   The Evening Standard perhaps said it best when it described
London as an ``ethnic kaleidoscope _ always shaking into a new
pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   This sprawling city of 8 million has 33 distinct ethnic
communities speaking 300 languages. One central London school
recently reported that its 800 students speak 79 languages at home.
At school they are unified in their struggle with English.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of this multi-ethnic seasoning is palpable. In fact,
the favorite food in Britain no longer is fish and chips or
steak-and-kidney pie _ it's curry.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon has sparked a wave of creativity matched only by
the bell-bottomed Carnaby Street revolution of the mid '60s that
introduced wide belts and frilly Edwardian suits to millions of
American closets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other place in the world like this city today,''
London musician Aki Navaz said recently in The New York Times. ``I
used to look through the windows at the white world. Now I know
that white kids are looking through mine, wanting to join in with
this energy.''
</P>
<P>
   London even has become a cultural center for other cultures. In
June, the best and brightest of ``Bollywood'' - the Indian version
of Hollywood - flocked to the Millennium Dome for the Indian
version of the Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   With Britons, ``Bollywood'' takes a backseat only to Hollywood.
A new 30-screen cineplex is dedicating six screens to Bollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Three Bollywood movies, known as extravagant productions of epic
lengths and lavish musical interludes, entered the United Kingdom's
top 10 list this year.
</P>
<P>
   Mambo Sharman, one of the Bollywood awards organizers, said he
was amazed at this trend. ``Often I go past a cinema in London and
look at the queues for Bollywood films and there are as many white
faces as Indians,'' he said in a recent interview. ``It makes me
feel guilty for not going as often as I should myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Madame Tussaud's, the venerable British waxworks museum, soon
will add its first ever Bollywood display. And Andrew Lloyd Webber,
the superstar British musical machine with a keen sense of the
popular, is preparing to stage Bombay Dreams, a new musical set in
Bollywood.
</P>
<P>
   While it is an exaggeration to say non-whites now dominate the
London entertainment scene, the ethnic variety is nevertheless
remarkable. A number of black and Asian comedians _ notably Nina
Wadia and Meera Syal _ have become household names.
</P>
<P>
   Many young Britons are plugged in to Fun-Da-Mental, a
multiracial group that plays a fusion of Persian jazz, rap and
hip-hop. The music produced by these hip, young musicians as well
as the established Jazzie B of Soul II Soul reflects a mix of
original cultures shaken but not stirred in the traditions of
London.
</P>
<P>
   The British cutting edge is layered with artists such as Steve
McQueen, the black Turner Prize winner whose haunting film The Bear
has received praise at the new Tate Modern museum.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   These changes have not come comfortably to all Britons.
</P>
<P>
   David Irving, the historical writer and accused Holocaust
denier, earlier this year said he spoke for many of his countrymen
when he expressed longing for the days when Britain was more
British.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could go to Heathrow airport, take a 747 and fly back
10 hours later to find England as it used to be,'' he said during
his libel trial against Emory University professor Deborah
Lipstadt. ``I can't say I applaud uncontrolled colored immigration.
I regret the passing of old England.''
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative Party has found political capital in attacking
what it describes as a flood of immigrants from Asia and Africa,
with the implied threat to British culture and institutions if the
torrent isn't stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor government has responded by
tightening immigration rules. It has become so difficult to enter
Britain that a thriving black market has emerged in trafficking
immigrants. Last month, 58 Chinese immigrants were found dead in
the back of a vegetable truck where they suffocated while being
smuggled into Britain.
</P>
<P>
   For all the worries about immigrants, Britain remains very white
_ 94.6 percent white, according to government statistics. Away from
London and other large cities such as Birmingham and Manchester,
non-whites are rare. About half of all the non-whites in Britain
live in London.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, blacks _ mostly from the Caribbean _ constitute 1.6
percent of the population. Pakistanis, Indians and Bangladeshis _
generally lumped together and called Asians _ constitute about 2.7
percent. The balance includes Chinese and other groups.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, because the minority population is much younger than the
white population, the government estimates that in 20 years, the
percentage of non-whites in British society will double.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the predictable tensions over change, blacks and Indians
often say they believe for the most part they have been accepted _
if not embraced _ by whites.
</P>
<P>
   When Rasshied Din started in business a few years ago, he was
warned not to use his own name because the English would think he
was a ``second-hand sari salesman.''
</P>
<P>
   Din Associates is now the seventh-largest design consulting firm
in the country with a client list that features retail and fashion
heavyweights such as Tommy Hilfiger and Selfridges.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as the 1980s, Din was a pioneer. ``People would call
up and say, 'Oh, you speak English,' as if they were surprised,''
he said. ``It seems strange looking back, but you have to remember
that this was before there were any prominent Asians in business or
in the arts.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the changes, race doesn't occupy the august station in
British society or politics that it holds in the United States. For
many Londoners, it is a topic like sex and religion, best not
discussed over the dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   That may be changing. A strong minority vote was essential to
Ken Livingstone's election in May to become London's first elected
mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone now represents the largest base of constituents in
the country, potentially elevating the agenda of London minorities
to national importance.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Hall, a respected black intellectual, believes Britain is
becoming more like the United States in its racial dynamics _ if
perhaps in a gentler, more civil fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Britain going to accept its diversity and become more
humane? We don't yet know,'' he said. ``Yes, things are better in
some ways, but a lot of people feel left out.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there's no going back in the fundamental change in the
nature of London, making the city a unique and fascinating
experience, said Trevor Philips, a black politician and social
critic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hum of London's streets cannot be replicated,'' Philips
wrote recently. ``It's the sound of a hundred cultures softly
clashing, sometimes melding, occasionally grating uncomfortably.''

   LONDON _ Take a walk in Brixton.
</P>
<P>
   Four miles from the gray postcard propriety of Westminster,
Brixton is a riot of noise and color.
</P>
<P>
   It pulsates with hefty bass riffs and reggae rhythms dancing
from knee-high speakers on the sidewalks outside CD stores and
appliance shops. In the borough's lively street market, you hear
the melodious sounds of Yoruba, Shona, Arabic, Spanish _
occasionally even English.
</P>
<P>
   The market's shops and stalls offer London's best Afro-Caribbean
and African fare _ plantains, caramel-colored smoked fish,
thermo-nuclear peri-peri sauce and yams. The air smells of scorched
coffee, limes and coriander.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, bright red double-decker busses _ the symbols
of familiar London seem drab in Brixton _ pass through, a reminder
that the heart of the Anglo-Saxon universe is a 10-minute commute.
</P>
<P>
   No less than Parliament House with Big Ben and Churchill's
statue, however, Brixton now is a part of the fiber of modern
London, a city rapidly being redefined by its ethnic variety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Multiracial London is coming of age, and it is this that is
igniting such energy, buzz and creativity,'' wrote Yasmin
Alibhair-Brown, a columnist for the Independent newspaper and
author of Who Do We Think We Are: Imagining the New Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation started at the end of World War II, when
Britain began accepting a substantial number of immigrants from
countries that for the most part had been colonies.
</P>
<P>
   Most settled in London's boroughs. Today, nearly 25 percent of
Londoners are from non-white minorities. In boroughs such as
Brixton, the percentage of non-whites is 40 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   Cedric Wilson, a Brixton resident, came to London in 1952 from
Spanish Town in the hills above Kingston, Jamaica. Wilson, an
electrician, has raised children and now grandchildren in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still Jamaican,'' he says, buying a pair of fresh chickens
for his wife to grill. ``But these young ones, they are Londoners _
not Englishmen, mind you, but Londoners.''
</P>
<P>
   People here insist that London is no melting pot, as immigrants
don't shed their cultural identities in the process of
manufacturing a new one. Nor is London seen as a multicultural
mosaic on the order of Toronto or Chicago, which have ancient,
separate and sheltered ethnic neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   In London, things are more fluid. With notable exceptions, few
neighborhoods could be called ``Little Delhi,'' ``Little Jamaica,''
or ``Little Lagos.''
</P>
<P>
   The Evening Standard perhaps said it best when it described
London as an ``ethnic kaleidoscope _ always shaking into a new
pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   This sprawling city of 8 million has 33 distinct ethnic
communities speaking 300 languages. One central London school
recently reported that its 800 students speak 79 languages at home.
At school they are unified in their struggle with English.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of this multi-ethnic seasoning is palpable. In fact,
the favorite food in Britain no longer is fish and chips or
steak-and-kidney pie _ it's curry.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon has sparked a wave of creativity matched only by
the bell-bottomed Carnaby Street revolution of the mid '60s that
introduced wide belts and frilly Edwardian suits to millions of
American closets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other place in the world like this city today,''
London musician Aki Navaz said recently in The New York Times. ``I
used to look through the windows at the white world. Now I know
that white kids are looking through mine, wanting to join in with
this energy.''
</P>
<P>
   London even has become a cultural center for other cultures. In
June, the best and brightest of ``Bollywood'' - the Indian version
of Hollywood - flocked to the Millennium Dome for the Indian
version of the Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   With Britons, ``Bollywood'' takes a backseat only to Hollywood.
A new 30-screen cineplex is dedicating six screens to Bollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Three Bollywood movies, known as extravagant productions of epic
lengths and lavish musical interludes, entered the United Kingdom's
top 10 list this year.
</P>
<P>
   Mambo Sharman, one of the Bollywood awards organizers, said he
was amazed at this trend. ``Often I go past a cinema in London and
look at the queues for Bollywood films and there are as many white
faces as Indians,'' he said in a recent interview. ``It makes me
feel guilty for not going as often as I should myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Madame Tussaud's, the venerable British waxworks museum, soon
will add its first ever Bollywood display. And Andrew Lloyd Webber,
the superstar British musical machine with a keen sense of the
popular, is preparing to stage Bombay Dreams, a new musical set in
Bollywood.
</P>
<P>
   While it is an exaggeration to say non-whites now dominate the
London entertainment scene, the ethnic variety is nevertheless
remarkable. A number of black and Asian comedians _ notably Nina
Wadia and Meera Syal _ have become household names.
</P>
<P>
   Many young Britons are plugged in to Fun-Da-Mental, a
multiracial group that plays a fusion of Persian jazz, rap and
hip-hop. The music produced by these hip, young musicians as well
as the established Jazzie B of Soul II Soul reflects a mix of
original cultures shaken but not stirred in the traditions of
London.
</P>
<P>
   The British cutting edge is layered with artists such as Steve
McQueen, the black Turner Prize winner whose haunting film The Bear
has received praise at the new Tate Modern museum.

&HT;     HAND-HELD COMPUTERS MAKE A COLORFUL DEBUT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   According to some technopundits, the future of computing is in
the palm of your hand. Hand-held computing devices, they argue,
will soon supplant the PC as the primary way people communicate and
access the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   I've long been a skeptic of this point of view. Hand-helds are
cool for retrieving information, but frustrating for storing and
massaging it.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that the most common way for putting data into
a so-called palmtop is by first attaching it to a PC, then using
software to manage the transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at two devices that are cool to have on hand _ pun
intended:
</P>
<P>
   Palm IIIc _ $449, Palm Computing. Fans of the Palm brand of
hand-held computers have been dying for a color model for years.
The folks at Palm Computing have held off, though, because color -
while pretty - adds expense and robs battery life.
</P>
<P>
   But they couldn't delay much longer, because Microsoft and its
hardware partners have been aggressive about offering color
versions of their Windows CE and now Pocket Windows hand-helds.
Finally, Palm junkies can get what they need in semi-glorious
color.
</P>
<P>
   I say semi-glorious because the Palm IIIc is somewhat
underwhelming, a kind of technological anti-climax. Color on the
Palm operating system is not that impressive - in fact, it's about
one step up from the kind of hues you find on Nintendo's Color
GameBoy.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm IIIc comes with eight 8 megabytes of memory, which can
hold 10,000 addresses or 3,000 appointments. It has all the
standard applications found in other Palm units - a date book,
to-do list, contacts, an expense application, e-mail, a calculator
and more. It's just slightly thicker than the regular Palm III, and
much thicker than the cool, ultra-slim Palm V.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other Palms, it does not use replaceable AAA batteries.
Instead, it has built-in lithium ion batteries that give an average
of about two weeks' service on a full charge. The cradle that you
use to synchronize the Palm IIIc with data on your PC or Macintosh
charges the batteries.
</P>
<P>
   If you're good about dropping it into the cradle every few days,
you'll probably never get a low-battery warning.
</P>
<P>
   The software that handles the transfer and synchronization of
data is excellent, and can get calendar and contact information
from a variety of key programs, including Outlook and Act! On the
PC, it connects via serial port, and an optional USB kits allows it
to hook up to USB-equipped Macs.
</P>
<P>
   While it's nice to finally have color on the Palm, I'm not sure
it's worth the added cost. The Palm IIIxe, which has comparable
specifications, is $200 less. I'd rather save the cash and look up
phone numbers in black and white.
</P>
<P>
   iPaq Pocket PC _ $499, Compaq Computer Corp. Like the Palm IIIc,
this hand-held device isn't cheap. But it's just about as
cool-looking as it gets, and its use of color is much more
effective than that of the Palm.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq, playing off the buzz its iPaq business PC has gotten,
named its newest hand-held after the stylish desktop. It even has
designed the Pocket PC so it looks a little like the iPaq when
dropped into its synchronization and charging cradle.
</P>
<P>
   The iPaq Pocket PC comes in a brushed-chrome case that's
significantly heavier than the Palm IIIc _ you'll definitely know
it's there if you drop it into a shirt pocket. It comes with 32 MB
of system memory.
</P>
<P>
   It uses Microsoft's Windows for Pocket PC operating system,
which is a much-improved version of the original Windows CE
software found in earlier hand-helds. It takes a very different
approach from the Palm OS, which strives for simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   Windows for Pocket PC is very much like its namesake _ it has a
little bit of everything, from slimmed-down versions of Word and
Excel to a simplified version of Internet Explorer. The opening
screen, which resembles the Today screen from Outlook, shows your
upcoming appointments and unread e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   There's even a voice recorder, an MP3 player and movie viewer.
While the sound isn't stellar and the images are a little grainy,
it raises all kinds of possibilities. How about Napster for Pocket
PC?
</P>
<P>
   I really like the color screen on the iPaq Pocket PC. It's much
better than earlier Compaq color hand-helds, and definitely more
impressive than the Palm IIIc. The Windows operating system also
makes better use of color.
</P>
<P>
   But it does have a price. I got about four days' worth of
battery power on a single charge, which isn't bad, considering how
bright the screen can get. As with the Palm, conscientiously
dropping it regularly into the charging cradle renders battery life
a non-issue.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't care much for Microsoft's synchronization software,
ActiveSync, which pales in comparison with the Palm software.
However, the Pocket PC does connect to a Windows computer using the
USB port, which makes for fast transfers.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Palm and the iPaq come with modules that let you get
e-mail and wirelessly surf the Web. The iPaq has an interesting way
of accepting add-ons - they come in the form of a jacket that wraps
around it. This adds quite a bit of thickness and weight, however.
</P>
<P>
   The Compaq device is more expensive than the Palm, but frankly
you get more for your money. The display is better and the iPaq has
more built-in functions. If color is crucial to you when
considering a hand-held, this is the better choice.

&HT;     USEFUL WEB SITES CAN GIVE YOUR CAREER A BOOST 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I love asking job applicants, ``What's your
favorite Web site?''
</P>
<P>
   It's mostly a throwaway question, but what I like about it is
that the best answers are honest ones, not rehearsed ones. After
all, no book can give you the ``right'' answer to that question; it
all depends on what the interviewer is looking for.
</P>
<P>
   So what am I looking for? A pilot light, some sign that the
person in front of me is enthused about something on Earth other
than the particular job I'm offering. And that the person has been
curious enough to experiment with the Internet, even if it's not a
job requirement.
</P>
<P>
   There is no right answer, just a wrong one: ``I've never used
the Internet.'' OK. I'll keep you in mind the next time I'm
choosing people for ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the most crucial skills any worker can have are
curiosity, initiative and adaptability. If you have never used the
Internet, that is strike one, strike two and strike three.
</P>
<P>
   If candidates say they have tried the Internet for several
things but simply hate it, that's fine. But at least you ought to
know what's out there to see if it could enrich your life.
</P>
<P>
   What follows are my 20 favorite sites that are at least loosely
career-related. (Note the word ``favorite.'' This is not a
comprehensive list of the best career sites out there, which would
have required months of staring at Web pages. My mind is perfectly
capable of going numb on its own, thank you. It doesn't need the
Internet's help.)
</P>
<P>
   Here they are, in no particular order:
</P>
<P>
   Careerjournal.com _ A nice collection of career-related stories,
columns and other materials from the Wall Street Journal. You'll
find a lot of great advice here.
</P>
<P>
   Vault.com and wetfeet.com _ These two sites have plenty of
information on what it's like to work for particular companies or
in particular industries. They survey rank-and-file workers to help
in their company profiles, which cost a little money but are well
worth it once you've narrowed your focus to a few companies.
</P>
<P>
   Hoovers.com _ If you are looking at large companies, you can
find a lot of financial information here, as well as information on
competitors. It might give you background information that helps in
job interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Google.com and ask.com _ My two favorite Internet search
engines. New and unusual Web sites pop up all the time, and these
can help you discover other career sites, research projects or
pursue your hobbies.
</P>
<P>
   Rileyguide.com _ This points you toward many career Web sites,
not just for job hunting but for things like salary surveys and
career management.
</P>
<P>
   Careerzone.com _ If you are at a career crossroads, this has
several assessment tools that might help.
</P>
<P>
   Monster.com _ Tons of job listings, as you probably know, but
Monster also has decent career advice and is more comprehensive
than many of the job-posting sites.
</P>
<P>
   Cooljobs.com _ This has a lot of offbeat listings that are worth
exploring, if only to only to open your eyes to possibilities.
Among the categories during a recent check: juggling, explosives
and gaming.
</P>
<P>
   Recruitersonline.com _ Many recruiters from around the world are
listed here.
</P>
<P>
   Resumeblaster.com _ This pay service will e-mail your resume to
thousands of recruiters. As with all job-hunting sites, consider
this a supplement to your other efforts, not a miracle cure.
Old-fashioned networking still is the best way to find and land a

&HT;     EAST, WEST COAST LAW FIRMS TO MERGE 
</HEADLINE>

 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Pillsbury Madison &AMP; Sutro, an old-line law firm
in San Francisco, is girding its 126-year-old practice for the new
economy by agreeing to join forces with a New York-based law firm.
</P>
<P>
   Pillsbury, with 596 lawyers and a reputation for intellectual
property law, plans to merge with Winthrop Stimson Putnam &AMP;
Roberts, which has 265 attorneys and specializes in utility, energy
and aviation finance, officials from both firms announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The merger, which must be approved by partners from both firms
and is set to be completed by year's end, continues an industrywide
consolidation trend, creating a firm with 12 national offices and
four more abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to provide the resources to guide (clients) through
globalization,'' Pillsbury managing partner Marina Park said
Monday. ``For example, we don't have an aircraft leasing legal
team, and Winthrop does. And before, if we had a client that wanted
to do a large project overseas, they might go to a New York firm
for financing. It's one-stop shopping now.''
</P>
<P>
   The technology and globalization boom has brought big changes to
law firms, which have to compete harder for more demanding clients,
especially in the fast-paced Silicon Valley. Some law practices
have responded by trying to beef up their national and
international reach and offering a wider range of specialties under
one umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   Long known as a firm for West Coast blue-chip companies like
Chevron and Bank of America, Pillsbury in recent years has added
several emerging high-tech clients, including Vodafone AirTouch,
the world's largest mobile telecommunications company, and
support.com, which provides customer service software to Internet
companies.
</P>
<P>
   After years of well-documented troubles with boosting profits
and retaining lawyers, Pillsbury is in the midst of a five-year
overhaul of its operations after the appointments in January 1999
of Park and Chairwoman Mary Cranston.
</P>
<P>
   The primary goal of that strategic plan: Either expand to New
York and other key markets, or merge with a firm that already was
there, Park said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our vision is a firm with global resources that's positioned
to provide services to clients who are going global,'' Park said.
``We wanted to be able to work in the high-end capital and finance
markets, which really mandates a presence in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Park said that although many partners had left Pillsbury in the
past year and a half, ``the vast majority left out of mutual
agreement'' after discussions about the firm's direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were never in financial trouble,'' she said. ``We were in
spiritual trouble because we weren't moving, and everyone was
moving quickly around us.''
</P>
<P>
   The new firm, to be called Pillsbury Winthrop, would be headed
by Cranston, 53, who was recently named one of the nation's 100
most influential attorneys by the National Law Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Based on American Lawyer magazine's 1999 ranking of U.S. law
firms, Pillsbury Winthrop would rank 18th in gross revenues, the
firm said.
</P>
<P>
   Pillsbury has 198 lawyers in San Francisco, 81 in Palo Alto and
18 in Sacramento. It also has offices in Los Angeles, Orange
County, San Diego, northern San Diego County, New York, northern
Virginia, Washington, D.C., and Tokyo. Winthrop is in New York,
Stamford, Conn., Washington, D.C., Palm Beach, Fla., London, Tokyo,
Singapore and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could not be more pleased to be joining forces with
Pillsbury and to be creating one of the few national law firms with
real corporate and litigation depth in New York,'' said Winthrop
Chairman John Pritchard, who will be vice chair of the combined
practice.

&HT;     WEB BUSINESSES KEEN ON ONE-STOP BILL PAYMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CHRISTIAN BERTHELSEN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Now that banks, credit card providers,
brokerages and other financial companies have succeeded in getting
some customers to move their business on line, the money business
is betting the next most popular service will be Web sites that
allow customers to consolidate all their financial transactions in
one place.
</P>
<P>
   Since millions of Americans have begun doing at least some
banking through the Internet, the next logical step, they say, is
to combine banking, credit card, brokerage, insurance and even
mortgage servicing on one site, which the industry calls an
aggregator.
</P>
<P>
   Though industry insiders and observers say the trend is only
about 6 months old, several Internet service and content providers
and individual companies have begun to provide such services, among
them America Online and Microsoft's MSN Money Central.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies, such as Yodlee.com, have begun to provide the
service on a stand-alone basis. Among banks, Chase has led the pack
into the aggregating arena, planning to launch its own version of
the service _ with Yodlee as the backbone _ in mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   Other banks, including Citibank and Bank One, have retained
Corillian, a Beaverton, Ore., company that designs software that
enables the banks to provide aggregating service on their own Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web is uniquely suited for personal finance,'' said Chris
Jolley, product manager for MSN's MoneyCentral. ``I don't know too
many people who say, `I can't wait to write out a check _ or
balance my checkbook.'''
</P>
<P>
   Not all banks are happy about the idea, variously saying the
service infringes on copyrights or threatens the safety of consumer
data. Charlotte, N.C.-based First Union bank briefly sued Secure
Commerce Services, which operates an aggregating site called
Paytrust, in March for alleged violations of the Computer Fraud and
Abuse Act. The suit accused the company of ``screen scraping,''
that is, taking information off the bank's Web site without
permission.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was later withdrawn, but First Union now has strict
controls and rules governing aggregator access to its data. It also
requires that aggregators provide full disclosures to consumers
about the risks of sharing account information with a third party.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly 24 million investors now managing their money on
line and 21 million households expected to begin using on-line
bill-paying services, according to varying research groups, banks
see potential in sites that combine those services and others.
</P>
<P>
   Though most sites and companies decline to release numbers of
actual registered users, Stephen Franco, an analyst with US Bancorp
Piper Jaffray, predicted the number of consumers who use such
services will rise from about 800,000 this year to 4 million by
2002.
</P>
<P>
   Most sites offer some combination of on-line bill payment
service, bank and credit card account balance information, and
brokerage account access. MSN MoneyCentral and America Online,
favorites with some industry observers, offer users access to
search engines to find investments tailored to their interests as
well as equity analysis and chat, insurance and mortgage
information, financial planning tools and articles, and the latest
business news.
</P>
<P>
   MoneyCentral also offers a ticker that can be customized to
present news and quotes on stocks in a user's particular portfolio.
Once a customer organizes his money, Yodlee.com provides links to
sites where he can spend it.

&HT;     U.S.-TAIWAN VENTURE UNVEILS NEW BUSINESS JET 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (ATTN: W.Va.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTIONO _ Sino Swearingen Aircraft Co. has unveiled the
first completed model of its SJ30-2 jet, taking a major step toward
becoming the first start-up company to bring a business jet to
market in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   If certified by the Federal Aviation Administration, the San
Antonio company's six-passenger, $5 million plane will be the first
business jet sold by a start-up since the Learjet was introduced in
the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do our job right, we should be able to keep building
this airplane for the next 30 to 35 years,'' Sino Swearingen chief
executive Jack Braly told a crowd of more than 700 employees and
aerospace industry officials at the unveiling ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The new plane was rolled out of a hangar at the company's
headquarters at San Antonio International Airport amid pulsing
music, a waft of smoke and strobes of multicolored lights.
</P>
<P>
   Sino Swearingen, a joint venture between Swearingen Aircraft of
San Antonio and Sino Aerospace Investment of Taiwan, has so far
spent $250 million developing the SJ30-2, which is its only
product. The company employs about 400 people in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The company has 164 orders for the twin-engine SJ30-2, which it
says can fly faster and for longer distances than other jets in its
price range.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the plane can fly coast-to-coast without refueling,
something only jets in the $12 million-or-more price range are
capable of doing, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this will be a trend-setting airplane,'' said aviation
designer Ed Swearingen, who formed the company in 1995 and is a
Sino Swearingen board member. ``This will change the way people
build airplanes.''
</P>
<P>
   Most start-up companies that have tried to bring a new business
jet to market have run out of money before getting FAA
certification for their planes, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a new jet from the drawing board to the assembly line
costs hundreds of millions of dollars and takes years of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It remains a difficult market to break into,'' said Paul
Nisbet, president of Newport, R.I.-based JSA Research Inc. ``The
certification process is a really big barrier for small firms.''
</P>
<P>
   Swearingen still needs to flight-test the SJ30-2 before it can
get FAA certification and begin large-scale manufacturing of the
plane. The flight-testing process is expected to take at least
another year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a lot of work to do,'' Braly said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the attendees at the rollout ceremony was Sen. John D.
Rockefeller IV, D-W.Va., whose home state houses Sino Swearingen's
main manufacturing facility.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to convince Sino Swearingen to locate its plant in
West Virginia, the state invested some $4 million in the company
and built infrastructure improvements at its plant, located in the
city of Martinsburg.

`LOSER' WITH A WINNING ATTITUDE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Hard work and a nice-guy attitude have made Jason Biggs anything
but a loser.
</P>
<P>
   An acting professional since the age of five, the well-mannered
New Jersey native loves his family, respects women and apparently
doesn't complain about anything he's requested to do in a
professional capacity.
</P>
<P>
   This has resulted in international infamy as an abuser of baked
goods, not to mention, er, unmentionable parts of his own anatomy.
But heck, it's also made him one of Hollywood's fastest rising
stars at the tender age of 22, and he typically takes the
embarrassment caused by playing the butt of most of ``American
Pie's'' humiliating humor like a good sport.
</P>
<P>
   But like any showbiz success story _ and with four other movie
jobs since ``Pie'' hit it big a year ago, Biggs is bona fide in
that department _ typecasting is a concern. Take ``Loser,'' his
first title role. It's a great opportunity, starring opposite his
equally hot ``Pie'' ensemble-mate Mena Suvari and written and
directed by Amy Heckerling, whose exemplary track record includes
``Clueless,'' ``Fast Times at Ridgemont High'' and ``Look Who's
Talking.''
</P>
<P>
   And according to Biggs, playing ``Loser's'' Paul Tannek, a
friendly, naive Wisconsin farm boy with a ridiculous hat who is
derided and exploited by ``sophisticated'' classmates at New York
University, is a good first step toward the versatile, long-term
career that he's confident awaits him.
</P>
<P>
   ``About the role: It was cool!'' the casual, instantly
approachable Biggs says with characteristic enthusiasm. ``I got a
chance to do some physical comedy in `Loser,' but also to show a
sweeter side and a little more of my dramatic side, which is nice.
It was a nice transition from the crazy comedy I did in `American
Pie' and `Boys and Girls.'
</P>
<P>
   ``What's really important to me is to keep challenging myself,''
adds Biggs, whose pre-``Pie'' resume includes daytime drama duty on
``As the World Turns'' and an acclaimed Broadway run at 13 in
``Conversations With My Father.'' ``If that means taking on heavier
dramatic roles, then great. I come from a dramatic background even
though people, for the most part, have only seen me on the comedic
level. That's fine; a lot of people can't do comedy. But I'm proud
of the fact that I can do both. I love laughing and making people
laugh at something that I did. At the same time, the feeling that I
get when I am so deep into an emotion is equally as rewarding for
me. I hope that I can do both for the rest of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   If he keeps impressing filmmakers as he did Heckerling, that
hope should be realized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God, Jason is amazing,'' the director says. ``Jason is
cute, he's funny and he really can act and he's also a dream to
work with.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggs' work ethic, he says, was inherited from his parents, a
pediatric nurse and a shipping company manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of them worked their butts off and gave up a lot for me
to be here, which was very cool,'' Biggs says. ``And they
definitely raised me very well: great morals, great values, all
instilled in me by my parents. One of the reasons I can work like
crazy on these movies (Biggs filmed parts of ``Loser'' and ``Boys
and Girls'' simultaneously, and just did the same thing again with
his next two projects, ``Prozac Nation'' and ``Saving Silverman'')
is because that, even while I was acting and putting money away for
college, I was never allowed to touch it and would work odd jobs to
earn gas money.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggs got into show business by following an older sister who
was studying singing and dance to auditions in nearby Manhattan. He
modeled and appeared in commercials shot in the New York area as a
child, and moved to L.A. three years ago for a role on a
short-lived Steven Bochco television series, ``Total Security.''
There were a few nervous months between that show's cancellation
and getting hired as ``Pie's'' poster boy for teenage sexual
frustration, but Biggs nevertheless fell in love with his new home.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's cool is that you can go to the beach and the mountains
in the same day,'' says the actor, who's become an avid mountain
biker and snowboarder. ``People ask, `Don't you hate living in
L.A.?' and I'll just be like, `Look, I can go snowboarding in the
morning and then watch the sun set over the ocean. You do that
anywhere else!'''
</P>
<P>
   Do they get any nicer than boosting the city generations of
actors have found it cool to complain about? There does seem to be
a bit of too- kind-for-his-own-good Paul Tannek in Biggs, although
the actor insists that the role represents his greatest stretch to
date.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul was more of a, quote/unquote, character than anything
I've played,'' Biggs insists. ``Both the characters in `American
Pie' and `Boys and Girls' brought out more of me than he did. Paul
was a chance for me to really make something, with the challenge of
keeping him sympathetic while still making him a pretty big
loser.''
</P>
<P>
   Probe a little further, however, and you learn that one of the
few things Biggs might wish to change about his own personality is
the very thing that makes Paul such an ineffectual doormat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't answer a question like that, that's like saying I'm
perfect, which is so not true,'' Biggs says with a laugh. ``What I
would change about myself is kind of a detriment, but it's also an
attribute, and that is always trying to see the good in people.
There are some times when that ends up biting you in the butt ...
Although I shouldn't say that because, despite that, I'm not going
to not look for the good in people. I wouldn't compromise that.''
</P>
<P>
   There's evidently no keeping a good kid down. And even though
Biggs admits his growing success makes it harder and harder to
trust new people he meets, his genuine likability is also paying
off handsomely.
</P>
<P>
   In the upcoming ``Prozac Nation,'' he has a straightforward,
demanding dramatic role as the college boyfriend of a manic
depressive young woman, played by Christina Ricci.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds kind of trite, but this got me in touch with
feelings that I'd never dealt with before,'' Biggs says of the
``Prozac'' part. ``I had to love this woman but still be confused,
not knowing how to deal with her episodes; it was just a lot of
emotional stuff and really cool.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Silverman,'' which Biggs is currently filming in
Canada, is another outrageous comedy in which he plays a lovelorn
type whose whirlwind romance (with ``The Whole Nine Yards''' sassy
Amanda Peet) is feloniously intervened upon by two guys who are
convinced the woman is the worst thing that ever happened to their
pal Silverman.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a little of that shock-value humor in `Saving
Silverman,' but it relies more on zany situations,'' Biggs
cautions. But it's not as though Biggs is getting so big that he's
trying to distance himself from the stuff that made him famous or
anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gross humor has obviously been successful, for the most
part,'' Biggs points out. ``'Something About Mary,' 'American Pie,'
'Road Trip' and `Scary Movie' this summer are evidence. And me,
personally, I love that kind of humor. People don't always admit
it, but they love to go into a theater and groan at gross stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   And now that he's a hot commodity, Biggs says he'd be more
likely than before to subject himself to ``Pie''-style cinematic
ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd probably be a little more apt to do (the pie scene) now,''
he reckons. ``Back then, I was willing to do it because I knew how
funny it was and that the movie was full of potential, but there
was still a little part of me thinking that maybe I might be
jeopardizing something. But now I'd be like, `I'm going for it!'''
</P>
<P>
   But Biggs also knows that such childish things will have to fall
away if he's going to maintain his success over the long haul.
Youth sex gags will pass, along with many of the young actors who
are currently making them for a living.
</P>
<P>
   Not to sound egotistical or anything _ he's much too polite a
fellow to be like that _ but Biggs feels certain that he's one nice
guy who's going to last.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident, and I say this as humbly as possible, talent
prevails in the end,'' he says. ``I know what I can do and I'm
confident that I can make a long career out of this. There is this
whole business side of it _ you can make a bad movie, things can
happen, and suddenly you're not the flavor of the month anymore,
talent unfortunately aside. But I like to think that I will be a
survivor out of this group of young talent; I believe I've
capitalized on the right situations.'' &QL;

though people, for the most part, have only seen me on the comedic
level. That's fine; a lot of people can't do comedy. But I'm proud
of the fact that I can do both. I love laughing and making people
laugh at something that I did. At the same time, the feeling that I
get when I am so deep into an emotion is equally as rewarding for
me. I hope that I can do both for the rest of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   If he keeps impressing filmmakers as he did Heckerling, that
hope should be realized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God, Jason is amazing,'' the director says. ``Jason is
cute, he's funny and he really can act and he's also a dream to
work with.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggs' work ethic, he says, was inherited from his parents, a
pediatric nurse and a shipping company manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of them worked their butts off and gave up a lot for me
to be here, which was very cool,'' Biggs says. ``And they
definitely raised me very well: great morals, great values, all
instilled in me by my parents. One of the reasons I can work like
crazy on these movies (Biggs filmed parts of ``Loser'' and ``Boys
and Girls'' simultaneously, and just did the same thing again with
his next two projects, ``Prozac Nation'' and ``Saving Silverman'')
is because that, even while I was acting and putting money away for
college, I was never allowed to touch it and would work odd jobs to
earn gas money.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggs got into show business by following an older sister who
was studying singing and dance to auditions in nearby Manhattan. He
modeled and appeared in commercials shot in the New York area as a
child, and moved to L.A. three years ago for a role on a
short-lived Steven Bochco television series, ``Total Security.''
There were a few nervous months between that show's cancellation
and getting hired as ``Pie's'' poster boy for teenage sexual
frustration, but Biggs nevertheless fell in love with his new home.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's cool is that you can go to the beach and the mountains
in the same day,'' says the actor, who's become an avid mountain
biker and snowboarder. ``People ask, `Don't you hate living in
L.A.?' and I'll just be like, `Look, I can go snowboarding in the
morning and then watch the sun set over the ocean. You do that
anywhere else!'''
</P>
<P>
   Do they get any nicer than boosting the city generations of
actors have found it cool to complain about? There does seem to be
a bit of too- kind-for-his-own-good Paul Tannek in Biggs, although
the actor insists that the role represents his greatest stretch to
date.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul was more of a, quote/unquote, character than anything
I've played,'' Biggs insists. ``Both the characters in `American
Pie' and `Boys and Girls' brought out more of me than he did. Paul
was a chance for me to really make something, with the challenge of
keeping him sympathetic while still making him a pretty big
loser.''
</P>
<P>
   Probe a little further, however, and you learn that one of the
few things Biggs might wish to change about his own personality is
the very thing that makes Paul such an ineffectual doormat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't answer a question like that, that's like saying I'm
perfect, which is so not true,'' Biggs says with a laugh. ``What I
would change about myself is kind of a detriment, but it's also an
attribute, and that is always trying to see the good in people.
There are some times when that ends up biting you in the butt ...
Although I shouldn't say that because, despite that, I'm not going
to not look for the good in people. I wouldn't compromise that.''
</P>
<P>
   There's evidently no keeping a good kid down. And even though
Biggs admits his growing success makes it harder and harder to
trust new people he meets, his genuine likability is also paying
off handsomely.
</P>
<P>
   In the upcoming ``Prozac Nation,'' he has a straightforward,
demanding dramatic role as the college boyfriend of a manic
depressive young woman, played by Christina Ricci.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds kind of trite, but this got me in touch with
feelings that I'd never dealt with before,'' Biggs says of the
``Prozac'' part. ``I had to love this woman but still be confused,
not knowing how to deal with her episodes; it was just a lot of
emotional stuff and really cool.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Silverman,'' which Biggs is currently filming in
Canada, is another outrageous comedy in which he plays a lovelorn
type whose whirlwind romance (with ``The Whole Nine Yards''' sassy
Amanda Peet) is feloniously intervened upon by two guys who are
convinced the woman is the worst thing that ever happened to their
pal Silverman.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a little of that shock-value humor in `Saving
Silverman,' but it relies more on zany situations,'' Biggs
cautions. But it's not as though Biggs is getting so big that he's
trying to distance himself from the stuff that made him famous or
anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gross humor has obviously been successful, for the most
part,'' Biggs points out. ``'Something About Mary,' 'American Pie,'
'Road Trip' and `Scary Movie' this summer are evidence. And me,
personally, I love that kind of humor. People don't always admit
it, but they love to go into a theater and groan at gross stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   And now that he's a hot commodity, Biggs says he'd be more
likely than before to subject himself to ``Pie''-style cinematic
ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd probably be a little more apt to do (the pie scene) now,''
he reckons. ``Back then, I was willing to do it because I knew how
funny it was and that the movie was full of potential, but there
was still a little part of me thinking that maybe I might be
jeopardizing something. But now I'd be like, `I'm going for it!'''
</P>
<P>
   But Biggs also knows that such childish things will have to fall
away if he's going to maintain his success over the long haul.
Youth sex gags will pass, along with many of the young actors who
are currently making them for a living.
</P>
<P>
   Not to sound egotistical or anything _ he's much too polite a
fellow to be like that _ but Biggs feels certain that he's one nice
guy who's going to last.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident, and I say this as humbly as possible, talent
prevails in the end,'' he says. ``I know what I can do and I'm
confident that I can make a long career out of this. There is this
whole business side of it _ you can make a bad movie, things can
happen, and suddenly you're not the flavor of the month anymore,
talent unfortunately aside. But I like to think that I will be a
survivor out of this group of young talent; I believe I've
capitalized on the right situations.'' &QL;

ENGLISH, THE INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Foreign travel offers some unique challenges, not the least of
which is translating the local signs.
</P>
<P>
   These head-scratchers were brought to my attention by the
Vancouver English Centre:
</P>
<P>
   On the door of a Moscow hotel room: ``If this is your first
visit to the USSR, you are welcome to it.''
</P>
<P>
   With excessive generosity of this sort, it's no wonder the
Soviet Union collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   From a Japanese information booklet about using a hotel air
conditioner: ``Cooles and Heates: If you want just condition of
warm in your room, please control yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   What if you control yourself and your room is still too cooles?
Clearly, this information booklet is not as detailed as it should
be.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisement for donkey rides in Thailand: ``Would you like to
ride on your own ass?''
</P>
<P>
   That's probably what would happen if I attempted to climb aboard
an unwilling donkey.
</P>
<P>
   In a Paris hotel elevator: ``Please leave your values at the
front desk.''
</P>
<P>
   This sort of casual immorality may be OK for the French, but I
prefer to keep my values in my pants pocket where they belong.
</P>
<P>
   On the menu of a Polish hotel: ``Salad a firm's own make; limpid
red beet soup with cheesy dumplings in the form of a finger;
roasted duck let loose; beef rashers beaten up in the country
people's fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like that kitchen is a pretty violent place. I am curious
about the roasted duck let loose, however. Do you have to catch it
before you can eat it, and if so, wouldn't that seem to indicate
it's a trifle underdone? Kind of makes you hope there's a
McDonald's close by.
</P>
<P>
   From a brochure of a car rental firm in Tokyo: ``When passenger
of foot heave in sight, tootle the horn. Trumpet him melodiously at
first, but if he still obstacles your passage then tootle him with
vigor.''
</P>
<P>
   Way too complicated. The Japanese should treat passengers of
foot the way we do in Florida: Run 'em down, then tootle the horn.
</P>
<P>
   Two signs from a Majorcan shop: ``English well talking. Here
speeching American.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, so that's it! George W. is speaking Majorcan!
</P>
<P>
   In a Belgrade hotel elevator: ``To move the cabin, push button
for wishing floor. If the cabin should enter more persons, each one
should press a number of wishing floor. Driving is then going
alphabetically by national order.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like it might take days to go from floor to floor in
Belgrade elevators. By the time they got around to driving
alphabetically by national order, you'd be wishing you'd taken the
stairs.
</P>
<P>
   In a Copenhagen airline ticket office: ``We take your bags and
send them in all directions.''
</P>
<P>
   You don't need to go to Copenhagen for that; you can receive
that sort of treatment right here in the states.
</P>
<P>
   In a Norwegian cocktail lounge: ``Ladies are requested not to
have children at the bar.''
</P>
<P>
   A sound policy. They should try to have them on Belgrade
elevators where, due to the general pandemonium, no one would
notice.
</P>
<P>
   In an Acapulco hotel: ``The manager has personally passed all
the water served here.''
</P>
<P>
   I guess that would explain the lack of ice cubes.
</P>
<P>
   On the menu of a Swiss restaurant: ``Our wines leave you nothing
to hope for.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, I don't know about that. I'm still very curious about the
roasted duck let loose.
</P>

&HT;     GLIMMER OF HOPE FOR REVIVAL OF CALIFORNIA'S BROWN PELICAN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JANE KAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   POINT LOBOS STATE RESERVE, Calif. _ Jutting out from the rocky
shoreline south of Carmel Bay is a popular bird-watching peninsula
called Pelican Point.
</P>
<P>
   Yet its namesake, the endangered California brown pelican,
hasn't nested here for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   This year, things may be changing. Hundreds of brown pelicans
are swarming around the point and its little offshore rock islands,
raising hope that the remarkable seabird threatened by the
insecticide DDT will once again return to mate, build nests and
hatch young in Central California.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 birds swirl overhead, fishing and preening on the
rocks in the state reserve, three times as many as in previous
years, Point Lobos State Reserve rangers report.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly for scientists, the pelicans are courting.
They're nuzzling necks, rubbing bills, trading sticks, bobbing
heads and flapping wings as they face one another, and even
experimenting with mating tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been doing the dance, but that's all they're
doing,'' said Chuck Bancroft, a Point Lobos State Reserve ranger
for the past 19 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe within the next couple of years, we'll get lucky, and
they can start nesting here again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bird Island, the largest of the guano-encrusted rocks offshore
from the reserve 3 miles south of Carmel and 120 miles south of San
Francisco, has been documented as the northernmost nesting ground
of the California brown pelican.
</P>
<P>
   Sparse, early research shows the presence of nests and young on
Bird Island in the late 1920s through the 1950s. The last chicks
were seen in 1959, and the last nests in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 60,000 mating pairs of pelicans left in the world
breed, nest and hatch young in Baja California, Mexico. The Channel
Islands of Anacapa and Santa Barbara, with up to 7,000 pairs of
California brown pelicans, are the only permanent nesting rookeries
in California.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of brown pelicans are leaving these nesting
areas to migrate to southern British Columbia for feeding and
roosting. But they are not nesting, which involves producing young.
</P>
<P>
   On schedule, some of the giant birds, which grow to 4 feet tall
and weigh 11 pounds, are stopping in San Francisco Bay, following
the anchovies, sardines, mackerel, smelt and grunion.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the pelicans left months earlier, arriving at Bird
Island when breeding was still going strong in the Channel Islands
and Baja. They are so numerous here that visitors to the state
reserve can sit for hours on the shore, watching with binoculars as
the birds return from fishing. The flapping of their strong,
6-foot-wide wings sends down soft, feathery sounds.
</P>
<P>
   The pelicans glide back to the rocks with bills jutted, landing
with splayed legs. Nestled in rock crevices, they preen and doze,
hunching down and turning their big bills onto their backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Point Lobos is the perfect place to see birds. You can stand
on the point and look across,'' said Dan Anderson, a professor of
wildlife biology at the University of California at Davis and one
of the country's foremost brown pelican researchers.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the raucous calls of the western gull and the
croaks of the nesting dark-brown Brandt's cormorants, with which
they split the territory, the pelicans utter hardly a sound.
</P>
<P>
   For 30 years, UC-Davis scientists have published dozens of
papers on the effects of contaminants, food supply, commercial
fishing and oil spills on brown pelicans.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson and others are cautious about whether the big numbers
and courtship activities mean the advent of nests at Point Lobos.
Sometimes, Anderson said, pelicans are ``just playing house.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Long, acting chairman of the California Academy of
Sciences' Department of Ornithology and Mammalogy, agrees. At the
Farallon Islands, where pelicans visit to feed, yet don't nest, he
sees similar behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oftentimes, it's not that they're breeding, but the young,
inexperienced birds will practice their courtship with one
another,'' he said. ``They may be going through the motions at Bird
Island.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Anderson and Long haven't seen the birds at Bird Island,
relying on an assessment by the respected Alan Baldridge, librarian
emeritus of Stanford University's Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific
Grove. Baldridge wrote a definitive 1973 paper on past nesting at
Bird Island, and visited the site in May. He confirmed the typical
posturing of breeding and ``some amateurish attempts at
copulation.''
</P>
<P>
   After closely examining their coloration, Baldridge concluded
the birds were immature, probably 3 years old, a year short of
breeding age.
</P>
<P>
   ``The birds didn't have the Cabernet-colored pouches and yellow
on the crown feathers,'' Baldridge said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we think is if the conditions are the same next year, if
some of the same birds return, we might have a resumption of
nesting at this site, the northern edge of the known nesting
range,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nesting or not, ``it's a very good sign,'' Baldridge said. ``I
think when you have a population that's doing very well, they tend
to push the boundaries of their range. If they're not doing well,
they tend to retreat to a core.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a fantastic thing for a state reserve if they
returned to breed like they were breeding in the 1920s through the
1950s.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hopes are buoyed by an influx over the last decade at the
protected and more isolated Ano Nuevo State Reserve, 25 miles south
of San Francisco. Rangers report some rookie courtship behavior in
the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Pelicans are about 10 million years old. The California brown
pelican is about 2 million years old. Since people started counting
pelicans in the late 1800s instead of shooting them, records show
they have been loyal to the Channel Islands. There they build what
look like crow nests, some big, some insignificant, sitting on the
ground or in trees, usually within sight of water.
</P>
<P>
   Skilled divers, they speed down at 40 mph from 100 feet in the
air to scoop schools of fish in their throat pouches. Sometimes
they glide just above the waves, braking in mid-air when they spy
food. Ornithologists think the way they crash into the water stuns
the fish.
</P>
<P>
   Pelicans lay three eggs a season, staying in pairs until the
young fledge. Then, the parents leave the colony as individuals.
They recognize one another almost immediately the next season at
the same nesting ground, and may link up again if they successfully
produced young the year before.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1950s, the National Audubon Society's Christmas Count
began to record a decline in the number of brown pelicans. Later
studies would find an increase in DDT residues in California marine
phytoplankton beginning in that period.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, former U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist Rachel
Carson shocked the nation with her landmark book, ``Silent
Spring.'' She warned how the widespread use of pesticides was
killing birds and other wildlife and harming humans. In a chapter
called ``And No Birds Sing,'' she reported studies and field
accounts of DDT's disruption of reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   In later studies, scientists tied the decline of nesting at Bird
Island in 1966 to the wider damage caused by the insecticide and
other chemicals. In California, brown pelicans, peregrine falcons,
bald eagles and double-crested cormorants were virtually wiped out.

OILS LIKE THESE DON'T JUST GROW ON TREES 
</HEADLINE>
   By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a world awash in olive oil, it is hard to imagine a new one
that could merit singling out. But several olive oils, and one
innovative grapeseed oil, are worthy of the attention of the
serious cook. None are cheap, so they are probably not for dishes
in which a supermarket brand will do. But if you have a wardrobe of
olive oils for different purposes, you might consider some of
these.
</P>
<P>
   For one of them, you'll need your freezer. It's Novizio, an
extra virgin olive oil from the Antinori wine family of Tuscany and
Martini Bernardi, an olive oil producer, also of Tuscany. Along
with 100 other oils, it was introduced last week at the Fancy Food
trade show in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The oil, pressed in Tuscany from green olives grown in Apulia,
is flash frozen as soon as it is bottled. The purpose of the
unusual process, said Alessia Antinori, a daughter of Piero
Antinori, the winery owner, is to ``make very fresh olive oil
available all year.'' The oil has a lively freshness and is
extremely fragrant, with floral notes and a peppery aftertaste.
</P>
<P>
   Novizio must be thawed before its first use (this can take
several hours, so plan ahead) but if stored in a cool dark place,
it is supposed to retain its vibrant qualities and brilliant green
color for a month. After that, these qualities will begin to
diminish, but it still will be an excellent oil. Do not try to
refreeze it once it has been thawed. (One complaint is that the
bottle has a standard wine cork, which makes resealing difficult.)
</P>
<P>
   Freshness is critical to the quality of olive oil. Better oils
have a harvest date listed on their labels, and should be used
within a year, preferably six months of purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Whether consumers will be willing to pay the higher price for
the extra freshness promised by Novizio remains to be seen. This
oil has such a fresh taste that it would be delicious drizzled on
ripe tomatoes or over grilled wild striped bass.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Dean &AMP; DeLuca, 560 Broadway (Prince Street), and Grace's
Marketplace, 1237 Third Ave. (71st Street), are expected to have
the oil by the end of the month, with an 8.7-ounce bottle priced at
around $15 and a 17.5-ounce bottle at $25.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Another oil, named the best new product at the show, is ruby
grapefruit olive oil by O, a company in San Rafael, Calif., whose
citrus-flavored organic extra virgin oils are made by crushing the
whole fruit and olives together. The company already makes olive
oils blended with blood oranges, Tahitian limes and Meyer lemons.
The newest oil is rich, with hints of tart and sweet. Because pink
grapefruit is such a splendid complement for sweet seafood like
shrimp, scallops and red snapper, this oil would provide a lovely
finishing touch to the preparation, or could dress a salad served
alongside. It will be available in specialty shops next month for
about $18 an 8.8-ounce bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Supremo, of Hayward, Calif., also has a line of flavored organic
extra virgin olive oils, which it makes by infusing the oils with
citrus peels. They have piquant notes of lemon, lime and orange
zest, making them good for dishes like cold tomato soup, but they
are less complex than O's oils. A 6.4-ounce bottle will sell for
$10 next month.
</P>
<P>
   Another citrus oil is the Meyer lemon extra virgin olive oil
made by Da Vero in Healdsburg, Calif. This oil is made like O's, by
crushing the fruit and olives together. It tastes more of olives
than fruit, and the citrus adds only a subtle, pleasantly bitter
presence. It's tailor-made for steamed or grilled asparagus, or to
trace over sheep's milk cheese. The oil, in a 12.7-ounce bottle, is
sold for $20, plus shipping, by Katz and Co. in Napa, Calif.: (800)
676-7176.
</P>
<P>
   A more unusual newcomer is Salute Sante's cold-pressed extra
virgin grapeseed oil, which is made from grapeseeds that have not
been allowed to ferment after the grapes are pressed for wine.
Unlike typical grapeseed oils, which are pale and fairly neutral
tasting, this one, made by Food &AMP; Vine in Napa, is greenish and
somewhat more viscous and has a sweet, floral aroma and a mellow,
slightly fruity taste. It is also unfiltered, which gives it the
richer color, yet it's not cloudy with sediment. Like most
grapeseed oils, it does not solidify when refrigerated, so you
don't get clumps in your salad dressing or marinade, which you
might if you used olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a jewel-box oil, in a dark bottle with gold leaf on
the label, which costs $30 for eight ounces (www.grapeseedoil.com);
it will be in stores this fall. So use it sparingly, as a seasoning
for salmon poached in white wine, in a sauce for leeks vinaigrette
or on a tender salad scattered with walnuts and pears.
</P>
<P>
   In this age of specialization, Food &AMP; Vine is now developing
varietal grapeseed oils. First on the list is chardonnay, so the
oil can match your glass of wine.  &QL;

 &HT;    Shandling is certain to shake up Emmy telecast
 &HT;    By Kevin Thompson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Jon Cryer is starring on a new sitcom. Garry
Shandling isn't. That tells you everything you need to know about
the intelligence of network programmers.
</P>
<P>
   But the forever-wincing comic will be back in the spotlight in
September when he hosts the 52nd Annual Emmy Awards. Shandling
admits, however, that he's not up to speed on current shows. ``I
have to catch up on all my TV,'' he told TV writers at the annual
fall TV press tour. ``I thought ``Malcolm in the Middle'' was an
episode of ``Oz.''
</P>
<P>
   Shandling knows a little bit about the Emmys, though. He earned
four consecutive acting nominations for his brilliant role on HBO's
``The Larry Sanders Show.'' The only time he won, however, was in
1998, for writing. ``Since I started as a writer and consider
myself a writer, it was the most meaningful Emmy I could've
gotten,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Shandling hopes to shake up the often-staid Emmy format. For
starters, he doesn't want to give out awards. ``Just give me the
whole three hours,'' he cracks.
</P>
<P>
   That's really not a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, Shandling would like to see more pre-taped packages.
Those segments, he says, could be about the new voting process
(judges can now view tapes from home instead of gathering in a
hotel during a 48-hour period) or where stars keep their Emmys.
``Maybe we can open it up a little bit,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But will Shandling feel comfortable performing for such a large
audience? While his HBO series was a critical favorite, only about
32 people saw it each week in the relatively small cable universe.
``I was lonely not being in front of 50 million people,'' Shandling
says. ``I need to be in front of 50 million people. I wish we could
all go to therapy together.''
</P>
<P>
   Cameron happy to be father of four children
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Cameron's handsome yet boyish face hasn't changed much. The
inviting smile and precious dimples could still make young girls
swoon the way they did in the '80s. Yes, there are a few crinkly
lines around his eyes. But that's to be expected. After all, the
29-year-old actor, who played budding con man Mike Seaver for seven
seasons on ABC's ``Growing Pains,'' is the father of four kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy,'' cracks Alan Thicke, Cameron's TV dad, ``has turned
into a fathering machine.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a bit hard, though, to picture Cameron as a dad. When I
think of Kirk Cameron _ and I assure you that doesn't happen too
often _ I remember a scrawny kid whose voice was cracking. No,
puberty isn't always a pretty sight.
</P>
<P>
   So, what's it like being a young father?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great,'' says Cameron, who's married to ``Growing Pains
`` co-star Chelsea Noble. ``When I'm on my deathbed, and I'm
looking back on (my life) and say, `What am I really glad I did?'
I'll say, `I'm glad I had kids.' Being a dad is awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing Pains `` fans will probably think ABC's decision to
air a reunion movie is pretty awesome, too. In the film, the
Seavers gather one more time when Jason (Thicke) asks his grown
kids to return home to run Maggie's (Joanna Kerns) campaign for
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Obscure statistics
</P>
<P>
   Nothing bores a TV critic more than a network suit spouting
self-serving research statistics. Oddly, that's how ABC chose to
begin its Sunday presentation. Needless to say, while Larry Hyams,
ABC's vice president of prime time audience analysis, took 10
minutes telling us how great ABC is, I spent most of that time
doodling and wondering what Heather Locklear was going to wear
during her chat with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Hyams, however, caught my attention when he began throwing out
really obscure statistics about ``Who Wants To Be A Millionaire.''
For instance, I'll bet you didn't know that when ``Millionaire's''
audience is ranked by state, Florida comes in a dismal 47th with a
7.7 rating in the key 18-to-49 age demographic. Hawaii ranks first
with a 13.2 rating. Six percent of the people who watch Reege live
in a mobile home. Fancy that! Forty-nine percent own dogs.
Thirty-three percent have cats. And a whopping 83 percent drive a
good, old-fashioned domestic vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ABC plans only four new shows
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, ABC is rolling out only four new series this fall. I
say luckily because none of the shows _ including ``Gideon's
Crossing,'' Andre Braugher's medical drama _ looks promising. In
fact, the dismal sitcom ``The Trouble With Normal `` could be the
season's first casualty. But ABC would have you believe that
debuting a mere four shows is a good thing. ``It will allow us to
be so effective and target in our on-air promotion and marketing,''
says Stu Bloomberg, co-chairman of ABC Entertainment Television
Group. ``We see it as a plus.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, you gotta love network spin.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg producing documentary lauding WWII camermen
</P>
<P>
   ABC announced Steven Spielberg will executive-produce a two-hour
documentary celebrating the motion picture combat cameramen who
served on the front lines of World War II. ``Shooting Wars'' is
scheduled to air Dec. 7 and will be hosted by Tom Hanks (''Saving
Private Ryan''). ``Time'' magazine film critic Richard Schickel
will write, produce and direct the documentary. ``Shooting Wars''
draws on more than 600 hours of rare archival footage as well as 25
exclusive interviews with combat photographers.
</P>
<P>
   QUOTE OF THE WEEK (SO FAR): ``We're dead.'' Dick Van Dyke on
``Diagnosis Murder's'' chances against ``ER `` in the fall.

 &HT;    Taste of wine column
 &HT;    A frank take on an industry ploy

<TEXT>
<P>
   SWIRL HERE, A SIP
</P>
<P>
   there ...
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Mike Frank _ the irascible, always opinionated proprietor of
Arrow Wine and Spirits' Far Hills Avenue store in Kettering _ is
obviously out to steal my job. Frank has begun writing a regular
column for the ActiveDayton.com Web site that includes the Dayton
Daily News as a partner. Here's an excerpt from Frank's inaugural
piece, in which he explains why his column is titled ``I don't know
anything about wine, but...'':
</P>
<P>
   ``The title comes from something I've heard time and again at
our store. People will wander in with a sheepish look on their
faces because they've been intimidated by the foolish way the wine
industry markets its product. Instead of making wine approachable
the industry has surrounded it with an air of mystery and intrigue.
That is a shame because wine is a food product we humans have been
happily drinking for thousands of years.''
</P>
<P>
   You go, Mike.

<P>
   The ActiveDayton site also features a wine forum
www.activedayton.com/entertainment/forumschat/wine.html) and
listings of upcoming events.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Sixth Annual Vintage Ohio Wine Festival will be Aug. 4-5
at Lake Farmpark in Kirtland, in Lake County east of Cleveland.
Advance tickets are $13 for adults, $8 for nondrinkers or
designated drivers and $3 for children. For more information about
the event, call (800) 227-6972 or check the Web site at

</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Wine of the week, in the ``gloriously red'' category: 1998 Les
Baux de Provence Mas de Gourgonnier, $10.99: It's a positive sign
when, after pouring red wine into a glass, even the bubbles that
show up around the rim are dark purple. That's when you know you're
holding a glass of concentrated, highly extracted, palate-coating,
teeth-staining, attention-grabbing wine. This blend of
Rhone-varietal grapes, produced organically in the south of France,
has everything that big-red lovers would want; those who like
lighter-style merlots and gamays might want to skip this one. To my
tastes, it's among the best wines in its price range I've tasted.
Serve it with a slight chill with anything off the grill. Note:
some wine shops still have earlier vintages of this wine on the
shelf, which are quite good as well, but the enthusiasm of these
tasting notes apply only to the '98.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Wine of the week, in the ``chill-fully white'' category: 1999
Protocolo, $5.99: A tasty, quaffable white at a nice price. I led a
wine-tasting a few weeks ago for some folks in the local
mortgage-banking business, and this Spanish white _ the least
expensive of the four wines we sampled _ was a hit. Made from
relatively obscure white grape varieties (90 percent arien, 10
percent viura), the wine is dry but not bracingly so. Sip a short
glass before dinner, and you'll find yourself pouring a refill.

KITE FIGHTING FOR KEEPS, AND LOSERS FLOAT AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By SHAILA K. DEWAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A dozen Pakistani men from New Jersey, some in the
gauzy tunics and pants called shalwar kameez, clambered out of
their van at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens County. With
scrupulous friendliness, they greeted a group of similarly attired
men from New York. Forming a double receiving line, they took turns
giving each other brief, one-armed hugs and Muslim salutations
before proceeding to a Sunday lunch of halim, a viscous beef stew,
scooped up with pieces of flat bread called nan.
</P>
<P>
   Then they entered the field of battle.
</P>
<P>
   It was a circular, fenced-in area intended (and FAA-approved)
for flying model airplanes. These men, though, would fly kites. Not
fanciful contraptions of balsa wood designed to swoop gracefully on
curtains of wind, but lean fighting kites, with their battle scars
patched with Scotch tape and their strings coated with powdered
glass, all the better to cut loose the kite of one's opponent.
</P>
<P>
   After wrapping their hands with duct tape to protect them from
the glass, one man from each team began to launch their kites,
standing about 200 feet apart. The wind was strong _ one flier
estimated it was twice the ideal speed of 9 miles an hour _ and the
kites swiftly dwindled to tiny dots in the sky, unspooling up to
1,000 yards of line apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Tugging on the taut strings, the two men maneuvered their
fighters until their strings crossed, and then tried to use
friction or speed to snap the enemy's line. When it became clear
that a line had been cut, the winning team would give a shout.
</P>
<P>
   These limousine drivers, business owners and Wall Street
consultants learned to ``cut'' kites as children, standing on the
rooftops and in the fields of Pakistan. In the last few years, they
have rediscovered the custom, meeting on evenings and weekends in
the park to compete.
</P>
<P>
   On an earlier evening, Basit Mian of Jamaica, Queens, had barely
gotten out of his convertible Supra before he started flying.
``It's like a sport back in Pakistan,'' he said. ``They don't
consider it too good, though. People who don't study, don't go to
school, they cut kites.''
</P>
<P>
   But what was once a juvenile pastime is now a costly hobby.
``People are spending literally hundreds of thousands of dollars,''
Fayyaz Mehmood said proudly. Mehmood, 38, a convenience store clerk
in Trenton, N.J., who was in Queens to defend his team's earlier
victory against New York, pointed out Mohammed Malik, 47, who owns
a meatpacking company and is the New Jersey team's captain and
principal financier.
</P>
<P>
   The kites, which are brought over from Pakistan, ordered on the
Internet or bought at neighborhood stores, cost $2 to $3 each (a
kite that gets cut is usually gone for good; a winning kite often
sustains small rips and tears). The glass-coated string costs about
$22 a roll. And each team has a macho version of a spinning wheel
spindle: a DeWalt power drill that attaches to the spool to rewind
the string.
</P>
<P>
   There are other expenses. The Meadow Kite Flyers carry their
kites in blue nylon bags emblazoned with the name of the club. They
have traveled to Pakistan, where they helped organize an
international competition which they won. Some of them founded the
Kite Flying Association of the United States, and members are also
stateside contacts for the World Control Board of Kite Flying,
headquartered in Pakistan. They boast of the Basant Mala, a
festival to be held in the model airplane field on July 28. There
will be free food and music from 8 p.m. until the wee hours, thanks
to the generosity of members. And the sky will be filled with 5,000
free, ghostly white kites.
</P>
<P>
   The club members like to think that both their lavish spending
and that they are American will help elevate the sport to its
proper place in the world pantheon of competitive events. Members
even dream of Olympic kite fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Though kites were invented 2,500 years ago, probably in China,
this type of kite fighting is said to have originated in India. The
kites are made of simple colored tissue paper and sticks. Indian
fighting kites are diamond shaped, like the kite a child would
draw. Pakistanis fly mostly kites shaped like hawks.
</P>
<P>
   The head-to-head combat rules here are straightforward: the
winner is the last kite flying.
</P>
<P>
   The game is played differently elsewhere. In Japan, kite
fighters stand on opposite sides of a river and fly rokkaku, or
six-sided kites. In Brazil the piao fighters are shaped like
spinning tops. In Thailand, there is no cutting. Instead, kite
fighting there is a battle of the sexes, in which the chula, or
``male'' kite, and the pakpao, a smaller ``female'' kite, try to
knock each other to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Though kite fighting doesn't require much physical exertion, the
Pakistani kite cutters show their dedication in other ways. One
member of the New York Meadow Kite Flyers took his mother to the
airport five hours before her flight to Pakistan in order to make
it to the park that afternoon. ``You have to put the effort behind
your culture,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistani-Americans were not the only kite cutters in the
park that Sunday. While they tallied their scores (it was neck and
neck), the parking lot to the north filled with unaffiliated
players looking for a pickup game. Most were from Afghanistan,
where cutting competitions are organized by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, the Pakistanis play down in the field, the
Afghans up in the parking lot. But what separates them is not
nationality. It is their differing philosophies concerning string.
</P>
<P>
   Several Pakistani teammates explained that they use manjha, an
imported cotton string with a glue and glass coating applied by
hand. American kite-flying groups, who have modified kite fighting
into a series of symbolic maneuvers with no cutting, frown on
glass-coated strings, saying that they are a safety hazard.
Although the string feels like rough sandpaper and does indeed cut
unprotected skin, Sheryar Choudhry, a kite fighter from Queens,
later insisted that glass coating was no longer used.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Afghans prefer ``chemical line,'' which is much like fishing
line, and which the Pakistanis say is dangerous and has been
outlawed in their home country. Some people said chemical line,
too, was glass-coated, while others said it was soaked in an acidic
chemical that could inflict easily infected wounds.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing is certain: cotton can't compete with fishing
line. ``The lack of communication with the Afghanis is due to the
fact that they refuse to use the cotton thread,'' said Choudhry,
29.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a difference in kite style. Afghans fly
diamond-shaped kites that are smaller and nimbler. ``When it comes
to battle, they're unbeatable,'' said Habib Atamy, 32, an Afghan
coffee vendor who lives in Whitestone, Queens, and was out in the
lot with his brother-in-law. ``The Pakistani kite, it's heavier and
it goes down quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   Assadula Nassari, 29, smiled as he got help untangling his kite
string. ``We are homeless,'' he said, thinking of Afghanistan,
``though thank God we are not friendless.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Singh and his turbaned father, K. Singh, had learned of
kite cutting in the park by watching the Indian cable channel in
New York. The elder Singh took his son out to experience what had
been a favorite game in his youth in Punjab. His son, who had just
finished medical school, brushed aside a warning about the Afghan's
chemical line, saying, ``Give me a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, after losing two kites, his bravado had wilted.
``He has a fishing line,'' he complained. ``You can't break that!''
</P>
<P>
   The men stayed well into the evening, losing kite after kite to
the wind. But one person profited from their losses. Fahamida
Nusrat, a 10-year-old girl from Bangladesh, tugged a kite down from
a tree. It was, miraculously, intact. As her parents sat on a
blanket nearby, she carefully wrapped the kite string around an
empty water bottle and stood in the grass alone, trying to coax her
prize aloft.

`FALSE PAPERS': ABSENCES THAT MADE A HEART GROW FONDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Someone once said that nostalgia was the most beautiful word in
the language, in any language. Like the cruelest month, it mixes
memory and desire, but what is it exactly that we remember, and
what do we desire? In his beguiling new book of essays, ``False
Papers,'' Andre Aciman gives these questions deep, lyrical and
melancholy reflection, melancholy because nostalgia in this
rumination is connected to the quest to make sense out of a life,
even though ``we know there is no sense to be made.''
</P>
<P>
   Readers of Aciman's earlier work will not be surprised by this
rapture over the personal past. In his exquisitely wrought ``Out of
Egypt,'' in which he searched his memory for the city of
Alexandria, Egypt, where he spent his childhood, his evocation is
poignant and affecting because most of what he describes of life
there has vanished, along with the Greeks and the Jews who gave
Alexandria much of its vitality. This new book is a sort of sequel
to the earlier one. It shows the same refined sensibility, this
author's remarkable intellectual penetration and his gift for
language.
</P>
<P>
   It is a sequel to ``Out of Egypt'' thematically as well, with
Aciman dryly, wittily, urbanely examining the various meanings of a
life lived in permanent exile, thoroughly cut off from the smells
and colors of the past.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the essays in ``False Papers'' Aciman credits Marcel
Proust with ``a vision that gave memory and introspection an
aesthetic scope and magnitude no author had conferred on either
before.'' The same cannot be said of Aciman for the simple reason
that the Proust of ``Remembrance of Things Past'' came before him.
Reading these essays, with their almost languid appreciation for
the nuances and subtleties of consciousness, one feels that if
Proust had not existed, Aciman would have invented him.
</P>
<P>
   He begins with an account of a return trip to Alexandria, which
Aciman's Jewish family was forced to leave in the mid-1960s during
the nationalist presidency of Gamal Abdel Nasser. He quickly
realizes, as he visits the few vestiges that remain of the vibrant,
cosmopolitan city that is no more, that he is not experiencing the
powerful emotions that he anticipated his return trip would bring.
In a sentence that sums up the themes of this book, he writes:
``This is how I always travel: not so as to experience anything at
the time of my tour, but to plot the itinerary of a possible return
trip. This, it occurs to me, is also how I live.''
</P>
<P>
   There is enough rue in that remark for it to leak off the page,
but it is rue that contains an entire psychology of emotion. There
is a secondhand quality to all experience, including the experience
of remembering. We are usually kept from the ecstasy we anticipate
by a layer of consciousness that separates us from it. So in
Alexandria Aciman goes through certain motions _ looking at the old
neighborhood, revisiting the beach where he used to spend his
summers, cleaning his grandfather's gravestone _ without really
feeling much of anything, even as he remains aware that as soon as
he returns to New York, he will begin longing for Alexandria again.
</P>
<P>
   Aciman evokes a similar sort of disconnect as he ruminates on
other subjects: the sea glimpsed through trees on the Rome-to-Paris
train, the tiny park on the Upper West Side of Manhattan where he
used to go to dream he was in Paris or Rome, an unrequited love of
his student days.
</P>
<P>
   In each instance he draws out the idea that somehow experience
itself is less meaningful than the anticipation of it or the memory
of it or even the pure imagination of it. Others have had similar
thoughts. As Roger Shattuck points out in his recent book,
``Proust's Way,'' the young Marcel of Proust's novel observes his
first kiss with his beloved Albertine so closely that it becomes
like an object examined in a glass case, more analyzed than felt.
In Aciman's case the disconnect is given its particular character
by his identity as an exile.
</P>
<P>
   ``An exile is not just someone who has lost his home; he is
someone who can't find another, who can't think of another,'' he
writes in a marvelous disquisition on his little park in New York.
He remembers having been a young man in Rome dreaming of New York,
and now he is in New York longing for Rome and, at the same time,
knowing that he will not satisfy his longing by going there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I yearn for Rome when I am finally standing where I longed
to stand when I was once a young man in Rome?'' he wonders. The
question is rhetorical, but it leads Aciman to disclose the mystery
of his little park in New York, which is that it is not a stand-in
for Rome or Paris or any place he has visited as an adult. It is
Alexandria but not the real Alexandria; it is the Alexandria of
imagination ``that is perhaps more in me than it ever was out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean that one spends one's life attempting to
recapture the sites of one's childhood?
</P>
<P>
   It might mean that, but Aciman is more Proustian than Freudian
in these essays. He visits Illiers, the French town where Proust
spent his childhood summers and that became Combray in his great
novel. Aciman is struck by how ordinary the Proust house is, and he
realizes that Proust's powerful love for Combray and his
description of the place as rather grand parallel his own feelings
about Alexandria. They explain the mystery of what we long for when
we are nostalgic and in that sense nicely limn the delicate
meandering of Aciman's finely tuned mind: ``Illiers itself was
simply a place where the young Proust dreamed of a better life to
come,'' he writes. ``But, because the dream never came true, he had
learned to love instead the place where the dream was born.'' &QL;

<P>
   Hot day, hard time getting out of the city. By the time we got
to New Paltz, N.Y., the sun was halfway down, and Ray Bradley, a
modest farmer with a big-city resume, had already been at work 11
hours.
</P>
<P>
   At the distant end of a long, skinny plot of raggedy green
stalks, Bradley was a Coppertone blur in a stained T-shirt and
baseball cap. He was overseeing three field hands and half a dozen
city slickers who had driven hours for the privilege of a great day
in the country: the July 1 garlic harvest at the Bradley Farm.
</P>
<P>
   Picking garlic is slow work: you have to bend and yank the bulbs
one by one out of the cakey soil. Every so often, the pickers
gathered their smelly bundles and moved toward Bradley's truck, a
1984 heap with so much soil on the floor you could probably throw
down a few kernels and raise corn. By sundown the back of the truck
was buried in light-bulb-white garlic heads so fresh that it seemed
a shame to eat them.
</P>
<P>
   Garlic is available year-round, but the season for young garlic
is terribly short, only a few weeks in spring and early summer.
During that time, growers like Bradley rush to farmers' markets and
restaurants with crates of naked-looking new bulbs, soil still
clinging to their roots and stalks, their nearly skinless, barely
formed cloves as crunchy as apples.
</P>
<P>
   For some customers, it is a thrill simply to see garlic that is
not in a cardboard container. Others are charmed by garlic nipped
before it has reached adulthood and conveying spring in all its
senses. For the time-pressed cook, new garlic has a more practical
payoff: there is no need to remove annoying raspy skins, as with
mature garlic. You can slice and saute an entire head like an
onion. Its flavor can be mild or strong, but either way, garlic is
an excellent candidate for poaching in soups, roasting with meats
and pureeing for mashed potatoes, aioli and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, one of about 20 farmers selling new garlic at New York
City's Greenmarkets, came to farming through haute cuisine's back
door, as a chef in some of the city's top restaurants. He is a
Connecticut native whose father grew garlic, and whose mother
refused to cook with it. Bradley, 47, studied forestry and logged
in Maine and Oregon. But he had always been interested in cooking
and, in the late 1970s, became a kitchen grunt, peeling carrots for
a chef who circulated between Clearwater, Fla., and Cape Cod, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Next, he moved to New York, where he perfected his skills
cooking alongside his childhood friend David Bouley at restaurants
like Le Cirque and Montrachet. When Bouley opened a restaurant of
his own in 1987, Bradley served as sous-chef. He also helped hammer
the place together, Bouley recalled last week, as he scuttled
between his current restaurants, Danube and Bouley Bakery.
</P>
<P>
   For Bradley, the gourmet grind proved as tough as carting timber
out of the Cascades, and in 1993 he decided to get into the less
heated business of providing the provisions. He tried being a
middle man, tracking down hard-to-get ingredients for name
kitchens. Then he began growing the goods himself, renting seven
flood-prone acres in the Hudson River Valley on the Wallkill River
near New Paltz, where farmers have tilled the loamy soil since the
1670s. He chose organic methods, mainly because he had no stomach
for chemistry. The trick, he figured, was to find crops that would
thrive in his inexperienced care.
</P>
<P>
   Garlic, it turned out, is a survivor. Raised organically, garlic
``is smaller, but it tastes great and lasts longer,'' Bradley said.
Within three years, he was specializing in a variety called German
porcelain, which comes from the branch of the garlic family known
as hard-neck because the bulb has a stiff central stem.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Bradley plants cloves from the biggest bulbs culled
the previous year. (If he sells down his stocks, he buys seed from
Charles Bishop, a friend and fellow Greenmarket purveyor.) Come
spring, the cloves send up long green shoots, which curl like a
pig's tail. Garlic farmers chop them off to discourage the plants
from concentrating on flower production. More important, the shoots
yield a by-crop called scapes, which make a nice side dish sauteed
in butter or olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   The scapes, which are mild and look like Asian string beans,
have a surprisingly long shelf life, and Bradley and Bishop sell
them all summer, along with tons of garlic.
</P>
<P>
   By September, the garlic has lost weight and begun to resemble
the dried garlic sold in stores.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, word of Bradley's garlic harvest has gotten
around, and a couple of carloads of amateur garlic hounds arrive in
time to help, pocketing a few pounds for personal use and praying
that the former chef will offer them dinner. Last year, he put out
roasted lamb marinated in garlic and olive oil, a dish he likes to
garnish with fresh garlic chips, or croutons. (Thinly slice some
new garlic, and fry in butter and olive oil until crisp.) He also
likes to separate new cloves and sprinkle them with olive oil,
baking them in a moderate oven until they begin to soften, then
caramelizing them in a saute pan with a bit of olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer, Bradley works the farm until sundown before
Greenmarket days and heads for the city at about 3 a.m. In the
co-pilot seat is a 120-pound Labrador named Grizzly.
</P>
<P>
   Some shoppers seemed perplexed by a table piled with garlic so
new that it was still attached to its umbilical stems. Others made
beelines to Bradley's signature impulse item: homemade garlic dog
biscuits.
</P>
<P>
   There were those, like John Policastro, the chef at the nearby
Garden Cafe, who had other things in mind. Policastro makes a
seasonal soup using Bradley's bulbs and early fingerling potatoes,
garnishing it with scape-flecked creme fraiche. Anna Klinger, the
chef at Al Di La in Brooklyn, makes soup out of Bradley's garlic,
with chicken stock and little else, and she grills Bradley's scapes
and serves them in a fresh garlic dressing made with anchovies,
chili pepper and olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   New garlic is old hat in Berkeley, Calif., where Chez Panisse
and its adjoining cafe celebrate Bastille Day every July with an
all-garlic menu. Fresh garlic is ``usually sweeter, without an
acrid taste,'' Russell Moore, one of the chefs, said, estimating
that 450 guests went through 70 to 80 pounds of it last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   New England is still catching up with Northern California, but
``10 years ago, garlic got very popular,'' said Bishop, 57, a
former aerospace engineer who dedicates three acres of his
Susquehanna Valley farm near the Pennsylvania line to garlic. He
credits a September garlic festival in Saugerties, N.Y., with
stimulating interest in fresh garlic. No one knows how much is
harvested in New York State annually, but Bishop thinks he will
pull four tons this year, selling three and holding back the rest
for seed stock.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he started harvesting the first of four varieties, a
no-name soft-neck with a possibly Alsatian provenance, which he
brought from Germany eight years ago. His other varieties include
the German porcelain, which he describes as ``beautifully
impressive,'' with a strong flavor and a high sugar content.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sweeter when you bake it,'' he said. (Wrap a head in
foil with a bit of vinaigrette and push it around the periphery of
a hot Weber grill until it begins to collapse.)
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, despite his culinary background, prefers even simpler
preparations. ``Just slice up the fresh garlic and saute it in
butter until it caramelizes,'' he said. ``It goes great on steak.''
</P>
<P>
   For side dishes he suggested, ``Chop up some scapes and saute
them, and add them to mashed potatoes.'' Another idea: ``Cut a
baguette down the middle, open it up and put some olive oil on it.
Broil it. Add minced garlic, salt and pepper, Parmesan. Close it
up, wrap it in foil and bake it.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time we loaded the car and left New Paltz, we had enough
new garlic to keep ourselves in garlic bread for months. We pointed
the car south and drove until we got to a busy crosstown street. We
double-parked, hopped out and opened the trunk, which reeked. A man
driving by leaned out the window _ a real New Yorker, who wants you
to know he doesn't miss a thing _ and yelled: ``Hey! Is that fresh
garlic?''
</P>
<P>
   We took it upstairs and started cooking. &QL;

 &HT;    SENATE APPROVES INTERIOR BILL WITH EVERGLADES FUNDING
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate overwhelmingly passed a $15.5 billion
Interior Department spending bill Tuesday that includes $25 million
for Everglades-related projects.
</P>
<P>
   The 97-2 vote sets up a conference with the House, which passed
a $14.6 billion version of the bill last month.
</P>
<P>
   The bill includes $12 million to assist the state of Florida in
purchasing property near Everglades National Park to act as a
restoration buffer. The Clinton administration had requested $47
million.
</P>
<P>
   It also includes $9 million for construction projects to modify
the water system within the park. The administration had sought $12
million.
</P>
<P>
   Closely tied to the Everglades project, the bill allocated $2
million for land acquisition for Big Cypress National Park and
another $2 million for land acquisition for the Archie Carr
National Wildlife Refuge.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Adams, director of governmental affairs for the National
Audubon Society, said he expects the Everglades will receive more
money before Congress approves a final version of the Interior
spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``These numbers are not good, but I think at the end of the day
we will have higher levels of funding, consistent with previous
appropriations,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress has kept (Everglades spending) low to force the
administration to bargain for it, and they will have to give
something,'' Adams said. ``There is a bit of politics being played,
but we've been in about the same place the last couple of years and
the administration has been able to go in there and get them to
agree to higher funding.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has warned he may veto the bill because it does not
include enough money for various park projects or for Indian and
cultural programs.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the final vote, the Senate voted 50-49 to reject
a bid to block Clinton from designating any additional lands as
national monuments.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton already has declared 2 million Western acres as national
monuments under a 1906 law giving him power to act without the
consent of Congress. Opponents worry that he may use that power to
declare all or part of Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as
a new monument, making it off-limits to oil companies who want to
drill there.

 &HT;    Younger Sheen ready to give it a 'Spin'
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Charlie Sheen seems calm for a guy facing an
uphill climb this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is he replacing the irreplaceable Michael J. Fox on
ABC's ``Spin City,'' but he also has to take on his father,
Martin's, hit series ``The West Wing'' to do it. The two shows will
go head-to head Wednesday nights, forcing viewers to choose between
Sheens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, the shows are so totally different, it's like choosing
between 'Apocalypse Now' and 'Major League,''' Charlie said.
</P>
<P>
   Any words of encouragement from Papa?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hah! He says he's going to watch us topple and plummet in the
ratings,'' Sheen said with a grin.
</P>
<P>
   Father and son _ in fact the whole Sheen-Estevez acting clan _
are getting along fine these days after Charlie's wild years of
drug addiction that nearly tore apart the family. After several
rehab stints and brushes with the law, Martin had his son arrested
two years ago, and Charlie, 34, has been clean and sober since.
</P>
<P>
   Art will imitate life when Sheen debuts as Charlie Owen, the new
deputy mayor on ``Spin City.'' The character, according to creator
Gary David Goldberg, is ``a bad boy who's a good guy.'' The new
guy's career was tarnished by incidents that bumped him from the
political pages to the gossip columns in New York papers. Too close
to home?
</P>
<P>
   ``To ignore the reality of the lifestyle I led for a long time
would be a disservice to the show _ and to the comedic
possibilities,'' Sheen said. ``Being able to laugh at myself seems
like a good way to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   How much of Sheen's past will be re-created?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain things that can be portrayed in good
taste,'' Sheen said. ``Others really have no place on network
television.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheen is no stranger to comedy. After starting off in serious
films such as ``Platoon'' and ``Wall Street,'' he went for all-out
yucks in ``Major League'' and ``Hot Shots.'' But his stone-faced
comedy is light years from the fast-paced, pratfall style of
Michael J. Fox, a beloved TV figure for whom ``Spin City'' was
written. Fox, of course, left to spend more time with his family as
he battles Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first instinct was to end the show,'' Goldberg said. ``It
was Mike's idea to continue. We definitely would not have gone
forward without his blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   Other shows, notably ``Cheers'' and ``Law &AMP; Order,'' have
survived changes in leads, but such moves are risky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we have a leg up because we have a strong ensemble,
but we have no way of knowing what level of the audience's emotion
was drained by Mike's departure,'' Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox owns an interest in the show and may participate as a
consultant. Whether he will return for guest spots is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever he wants to contribute, we'd be happy to accept,''
Goldberg said. ``He's a guy who always feels obligated, and I don't
want him to feel obligated.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheen has talked with Fox several times since landing the role.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he felt he was leaving his baby behind with a very
trusted guardian,'' Sheen said. ``That was a nice shot in the
arm.''
</P>
<P>
   No questions, please
</P>
<P>
   ABC entertainment chief Stu Bloomberg called a news conference
and then refused to answer questions. Always tight-lipped with the
press, he responded to tepid programming questions a half-dozen
times by saying, ``I don't want to talk about that right now.''
Then when? After the press tour?
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg also insisted his network is not jumping on the
reality bandwagon _ even though ABC has three such programs in
development. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are conspiring to produce
``The Runner,'' which will send contestants across country as they
try to avoid being detected by viewers. Also on the drawing board
are ``The Mole,'' which will have contestants competing in a group
that will include an infiltrator trying to sabotage them, and ``Go
New York,'' an inside peek at an Internet publication.
</P>
<P>
   On the scene ...
</P>
<P>
   Spandex is alive and tightly wrapped around the stars and
wannabe stars who attended ABC's press tour party Monday at the
Ritz-Carlton in Pasadena. In the land that defies gravity, there's
no such thing as too tight. Everybody wears a size zero.
</P>
<P>
   Geena Davis, the ``Thelma &AMP; Louise'' movie star who has a sitcom
this fall, was sausage-wrapped in black. Ditto the entire cast of
``General Hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   A notable exception was Kathy Kinney, who plays acid-tongued
Mimi on ``The Drew Carey Show.'' She wore a sensibly full dress in
pale lavender. Without her blinding blue-green eyeshadow and
big-hair horrible sense of entitlement and a disgusting smirk,''
said Maher, holding court near a bar. ``But Gore is ultimately less
human. He could be an android for all I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, ABC announced it will launch a new
promotional campaign for ``Norm'' that will feature talking video
screens in selected major-market urinals. The text cannot be
repeated in a family newspaper, but suffice it to say there is word
play on ABC's yellow trademark.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he thought of the campaign, ``Norm'' executive
producer Bruce Helford said, ``Sometimes the low road is less
congested.'' Let's hope.

<P>
   UNDATED: African-Americans were the only ethnic group to defy
the trend of declining voter participation in congressional
elections from 1994 to 1998, according to a new Census report.

`GOOD EVENING,' THEY LIED 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX WITCHEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The original author of ``Thou Shalt Not Lie'' never
anticipated Nobu. Or Pastis. Or Cafe des Artistes.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the lying is about reservations, like ``I made it
a month ago'' (often heard at Joe Allen, which accepts them only a
week in advance) or ``My secretary set it up this morning'' (often
heard at Nobu, which its manager politely terms ``usually
impossible'').
</P>
<P>
   During the last year or so, restaurateurs all over the city say,
lying has spiraled out of control. People want what they want when
they want it, and, well, if they didn't plan in advance, they're
just going to show up and demand it. And they're not only looking
for something as modest as a table for two. Parties of 12 are
walking in the door unannounced, brandishing a major sense of
entitlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens in an economic boom,'' said Clark Wolf, a
restaurant consultant based in Manhattan. ``When all the really big
Hamptons estates are sold, New Yorkers need another place to
compete.''
</P>
<P>
   And it really is a competition, with top restaurants like Babbo
and Nobu booking one month in advance, and many more accepting
reservations no more than a week ahead. Of course, for some people,
it's sport to show up unannounced and see what they can get away
with. When they cheat and win, the thrill is complete. Then again,
there are others who are simply lazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just forgot to call and do it,'' one liar told me.
</P>
<P>
   She appeared anyway with a friend after the theater one night at
Joe Allen, insisting she had called. She was seated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lying happens several times an evening,'' said Sara Collins, a
manager and maitre d'hotel at Nobu. ``We have a very good
reservations system, and inherent in the system are controls about
who's telling the truth. Oftentimes, a group of eight will stand in
front of me and in the thick of it they can't answer the right
questions. The ones who are lying always come in ready to fight.
They think they can intimidate us, and since I'm a woman they think
I'll ultimately buckle and be afraid of them.''
</P>
<P>
   She sighed. ``They think it's a great thing to brag that they
just walked into Nobu and got a table, because the restaurant has
become a cult thing, if you will. People know how difficult it is
to get in here.''
</P>
<P>
   You might think that a really smart liar would take a different
tack and try to charm the staff, rather than alienate it. (Charming
liars who are willing to wait get better treatment than their nasty
counterparts, restaurateurs admit.) But the ones who start off
nasty, they say, are dead giveaways.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the name is not in the book and the people are not the
least bit polite, all signs point to guilty,'' said Mike Cetta, the
owner of Sparks Steakhouse. ``Though you've got to play it by ear.
The good news is we have 684 seats. If we have a table, we'll seat
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Some liars reveal themselves more quickly than others. Jenifer
Lang, the managing director of Cafe des Artistes, who is married to
its owner, George Lang, recalled: ``A couple came in once without a
reservation and they were very loud, saying, `Jenifer and George
Lang are really close friends of ours.' George and I were standing
right there in front of them.'' She laughed. ``It happens a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephane Gerbier, the general manager at Pastis, has had similar
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultimate line is, `I'm a friend of Keith's,''' he said,
referring to the restaurant's owner, Keith McNally. ``Much of our
staff has worked with Keith in the past, so they tend to know his
friends.'' He sighed. ``But we're trained to be agreeable. It's not
a kick for a us to find a liar.''
</P>
<P>
   Another way some people lie their way through a restaurant's
door is to skip playing pals with the owner and go for the big
time: using real celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week, someone called who said he was coming in with Tom
Cruise and they wanted to be served late,'' Lang said. ``They
preordered their dinner and we made special arrangements to stay
open. They showed up an hour late and came in without him.''
</P>
<P>
   Did anyone say anything? ``No, we're in the hospitality
business,'' she said philosophically. ``We also had Howard Stern
last week. He was a 75-year-old man who came in with his wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Della Femina, who owns Della Femina in New York and East
Hampton, had an even more unnerving experience. ``I called Alison's
by the Beach to make a reservation last week,'' he said, ``and I
said who I was and the woman asked, `Are you  &UR; really? &LR; ' It turned
out that a few weeks ago someone called and said it was me with a
party of eight, and even though the restaurant was really booked,
they spent an hour reconfiguring everything. Then in walks a short
fat guy with lots of hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Della Femina is notoriously bald.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, a stunt like that will work only once, though
for some, once is enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people feel restaurants are fair game, and when
they're in the Hamptons they're even more fair game,'' Della Femina
said. He recalled an incident that his staff named the Happy
Birthday Barbara Scam, which was a reservation for a birthday
dinner for 12 on a Saturday night in the middle of the summer. The
group requested a custom birthday cake, which the restaurant
special-ordered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three or four days later,'' Della Femina said, ``the baker
called to say that Laundry had put in an order for a cake for 12,
East Hampton Point ordered a cake for 12 and Nick &AMP; Toni's ordered
a cake for 12. These people were going to literally stiff one of
us. We stopped our order that day and the people never showed up.
Later, we found that they had also tried booking at the Palm that
night but had been turned down. I'm not even sure where they wound
up. But that's beyond being cynical.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Also hovering in the beyond-cynical category, said Tom
Piscitello, a maitre d'hotel at Babbo, is the new rash of
self-styled concierges. ``That's what they call themselves, but
what they do is broker tables for money,'' he said. ``They learn a
restaurant's booking system, secure tables and sell them to other
people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard all of the stories people can come up with,'' he
went on. ``There are no new ones.'' One of the ways the Babbo staff
weeds out storytellers is to assign reservation numbers. But
Piscitello stressed: ``We try to bend over backwards to accommodate
people. If someone wants to eat here, they will. They'll just
wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough, if a liar's got the time and inclination. But at
theater district restaurants, for example, the schedule is not as
flexible, since the dinner hour begins at around 10 p.m. or later.
(Pre-theater lying has a very low glamour quotient: after the show
is when the actors tend to eat and bring their famous friends with
them.)
</P>
<P>
   Angus McIndoe, a maitre d'hotel at Joe Allen, says he can expect
an influx of up to 20 people at one time at 11 on a Saturday night.
``What bothers me most is when people come in then and lie,'' he
said. ``They try to intimidate the staff while they hold up
everyone else who did things honestly. The people who do it feel
it's OK to do it. But I can never say, `Are you lying?' to a
customer, and I can't insinuate that because there is always a .01
percent chance that we've made a mistake. So, I tell them, if we
have a table, you'll get it. We treat them like a walk-in.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a restaurant like Joe Allen, which is a traditional
hangout for people in show business, is not the best place for a
liar to stage a scene. As McIndoe said: ``If it is a Saturday night
at 11 o'clock and a celebrity regular comes in, I'm going to seat
him first. I'm not going to make Al Pacino wait at the bar for a
table.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's the whole point, isn't it? Because after all the lies
have been tried _ the lies on the phone and the lies at the door _
at the end of the day, one thing is clear. He really is Al Pacino.
And you're not. &QL;

   MIDEAST-TALKS (Thurmont, Md.) _ The White House painted a
picture Tuesday of little sleep and unwavering intensity inside the
gates of Camp David, describing scenes of President Clinton
negotiating until dawn with Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and
then, after a catnap, meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
five hours later. Informally, officials were suggesting that
Clinton's artificial deadline of 9 a.m. Wednesday, when he is
scheduled to leave for Japan, could be stretched by as much as 21
hours, an element of information that added to a steadily building
drama. By Jane Perlez.

   BRITAIN-EMAIL-SURVEILLANCE (London) _ As the Clinton

all but equating the state with Outer Mongolia. Not surprisingly,
Texans, a prideful lot, have taken offense. The criticism seems to

   ADOPTED-MONKEY (New York) _ The saga of Cookie Flikshtein has
stirred tumultuous feelings on both sides of the fight. To the
Flikshtein family and an outraged army of their neighbors, Cookie
is a beloved _ albeit simian _ member of the family. She may be a
monkey, they admit, but she has adjusted enough to the human
condition to spend most evenings eating Rocky Road ice cream and
watching the nightly news. The state agrees that Cookie is no
ordinary primate, but not because of her human characteristics. She
is a Diana monkey, an endangered species. As such, she deserves
special care, and the state, after a protracted court battle, has
successfully argued that Cookie should be taken from the Flikshtein
home and placed in a special animal rescue program at the Detroit
Zoo. By Alan Feuer.

BATTEN ISN'T FINISHED JUST YET 
</HEADLINE>
   By LOWELL COHN   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ It must be a pleasure when everyone says
you're washed up, and you know that's a bunch of baloney.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Batten was supposed to be washed up, but that was a lie.
Maybe you never heard of her. She's one of those people who
suddenly become news during an Olympic year when the world pays
attention to track and field. Batten's story is important because
she was once a great hurdler, and then she wasn't a great hurdler,
and now she's trying to be a great hurdler all over again.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't come in first in the finals of the women's 400-meter
hurdles at the Olympic Trials on Monday night. Coming in first
would have been too unbelievable. But she came in second and
qualified for the Olympics. And that itself is something of a
miracle.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for you to learn a few things about Batten. She's the
world record holder in the 400-meter hurdles. She set the world
record in 1995, which in the life of a hurdler, is a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   How she set the world record is interesting. First of all, she
won the U.S. championships a few weeks after recovering from an
emergency appendectomy. So we're dealing here with a tough cookie.
After that, she set the world record in Goteborg, Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   After that she started to feel pain in the big toe of her right
foot, which she refers to as her ``great'' toe. For a while the
pain didn't matter. She went to the Atlanta Olympics in 1996 and
finished second.
</P>
<P>
   Then everything went to hell. Her great toe hurt so badly she
couldn't rise up on her toes. A regular person would just learn to
walk flat-footed. No big deal. In a hurdler, it's athletic death.
After 1996, Batten's career was a slow decline to no career.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in the U.S. championships, she fell at the eighth
hurdle, and failed to finish the race. And then she just walked
away from track disillusioned and bored. Sorry. Thanks for the
memories.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that wasn't the entire story. She tried to make her toe
feel better. She traveled around the country in search of a cure.
She tested different shoes. She consulted doctors who told her she
had a bone chip, or that her toe was broken, or that they just
couldn't figure out the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, out of desperation, she saw a chiropractor in
Tallahassee, Fla. It's not that she believed in chiropractors, but
she had nothing to lose. This chiropractor did stuff to her toe
that Batten didn't even understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked out of there almost laughing to myself,'' Batten said
after Monday's race. ``This is like voodoo. But it worked. After a
day and a half, 75 percent of the pain was gone. Now, there's no
pain. I don't know what this woman's doing. I know she took the
pain away.''
</P>
<P>
   Just in time, too. Batten has been training for about a month,
which is almost like no training. She's not what runners call
meet-sharp. And that's a bad thing in one of the toughest track
events on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The 400-meter hurdles will rip out your guts. The event combines
the 400 meters, which is the most challenging sprint, with an
obstacle course. Even the best competitors are hurting at the end.
They're struggling and lurching, and none of them looks stylish
struggling across the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   But Batten's lack of preparation also gives her hope. She has
two months before the Olympics, and she's certain to improve. And
that means she's a threat to win the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Sandra Glover thinks so. Glover came in first Monday.
</P>
<P>
   When they had brought the first three finishers to an interview
room, Glover, who has the severe, sour look of someone who's spent
the last 24 hours sucking on a lemon, announced to Batten in front
of the media, ``Sorry, Kim, but your record is going down.''
</P>
<P>
   Batten almost fell off the podium in surprise. Later, Batten
spoke about Glover.
</P>
<P>
   ``To Sandra, I'll have my own few words to say,'' Batten said.
``I'm not going to be nice to her any more. We're not sprinters,
but I understand the sprinter mentality. I'll make my few words to
her very stern. Now, I'm mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Batten didn't know when she made her comeback and
fixed her great toe, that she'd jump right into the middle of a
controversy. What happens next should be fun.
</P>

WHEN THE VACATION BUG BITES, BE WARY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
 By MONICA ANDERSON 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This has been one strange summer so far.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, I wake up wondering what odd and fascinating thing
will occur next. Even the most mundane activities have taken
unexpected twists. For instance, I pulled into a gas station the
other day because my fuel gauge was on ``D.''
</P>
<P>
   I had been running low on gas for several days but I kept
forgetting to stop at the service station. This irritates my
husband tremendously but I never, well, hardly ever _ OK, most of
the time I don't run out of gas.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I told my son to hop out and fill 'er up with the
cheapest unleaded on the rack. Slowly but surely he got out and
started filling 'er up. A short while later I glanced in the side
mirror and started screaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop! Stop! For goodness sakes, take your hand off the pump!''
</P>
<P>
   My son was so startled that he almost dropped the hose.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wrong, Mom?'' he said. ``It's not even full yet. You
said to fill itup.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, that thing is on $30. I have outfits that didn't cost
$30.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're going on vacation,'' he protested.
</P>
<P>
   Grabbing my credit card from his hand, I said, ``Our plans have
changed. We were going to Pensacola but now we're just going to
drive until we run out of gas.''
</P>
<P>
   My youngest boy piped in, ``Mom, we could be anywhere when we
run out of gas. What if it's a boring little town?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you'd better bring something to play with,'' I suggested
as we merged into the traffic. ``And roll those windows down, I'm
turning the air off.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen hours later we pulled into Pensacola, and I tell you
those beautiful white beaches were worth the heat exhaustion
suffered from having those windows rolled down. We were staying at
a total dump but the hotel was on the beach and our room was by the
pool. My husband slept the first day we were there because he drove
most of the way and he was exhausted. I drove all the way to Dallas
_ from Arlington (maybe 20 miles)_ but then I got cramps in my
legs.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, we rented chairs and an umbrella and spent the day
on the beach. I only moved far enough to reach into the cooler, but
the kids rolled in and out of water like little chocolate waves. I
kept warning them to stay in my sight and not to swim out by the
reefs because there were no lifeguards on duty.
</P>
<P>
   My baby boy listened to me but Junior has a more curious spirit.
Before I could stop him, he was snorkeling way out in the bay. The
water was shallow but it still made me nervous to have him out of
arm's reach. Well, my intuition was right. At first, I ignored the
shouts and screams echoing through the air, but when I looked up
and saw everyone exiting the water like a scene from ``Jaws,'' I
was on my feet.
</P>
<P>
   I listened more closely to hear what the commotion was about and
I finally deciphered the word ``SHARK!'' The surfers, the tubers
and the swimmers were all hastily making their way to the sandy
beaches. Everyone but my son was coming to shore.
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I were yelling and screaming at him to get out of
the water. At one point, he raised his head out of the water and
waved at us. Then he went right back under the water. As my husband
started wading into the water to retrieve our child, the shark swam
by. It looked 8 feet long to me but they tell me it was just a baby
shark. Whatever. It wasn't my baby.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I have always maintained that I would fight a lion over my
children but I must confess that I did not put a toe into that
salty water. I left it up to Dad to rescue junior, which he did
with valor.
</P>
<P>
   When we asked our son why he didn't swim to shore when he heard
all of the people screaming, he said, ``I thought they were yelling
for some guy named Mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Strange. Very strange.

FOR INEXPENSIVE UPSTARTS, A DAY OF GLORY
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Calif., Mo.) By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last month, I flew to California to be a judge at the San
Francisco International Wine Competition. The event attracted wines
from 16 countries and 22 states in this country, many of them
places one normally thinks of as sources of good wine.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, when the final results were faxed to all 42 of
us _ importers, distributors, sommeliers, wine writers _ who had
been judges, what particularly interested me, aside from the fact
that we got through a record 2,783 wines, was the number of
moderately priced wines that did well.
</P>
<P>
   Against wines costing $100 and more, the best white was judged
to be a 1999 sauvignon blanc from New Zealand's Giesen Wine Estate
listed at $13. The best red was a tie: the 1997 Joseph Phelps
Insignia, a cabernet-based blend that lists at $120, and the 1997
Storrs Winery BXR Red Table wine, at $32.
</P>
<P>
   Among the eight best-of-variety winners were four wines priced
at $10 or less, including a sprightly Italian, a 1998 Montepulciano
d'Abruzzo from Dario d'Angelo at $5. There are restaurants in New
York that get four times that for a bottle of water.
</P>
<P>
   Let me explain about those 2,783 wines. Accepted wisdom holds
that no one can taste that many wines over a weekend and come away
with a coherent assessment. The accepted wisdom is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, that total can be broken down into 10 groups of about
280 wines, a not insignificant number but hardly daunting to a team
of seasoned judges. Spread over several days and divided into
groups of five or six varieties _ cabernet, merlot, pinot noir,
zinfandel and so on _ it becomes a rigorous but hardly onerous
exercise. In practice, the sizes of the groups varies widely; there
are might be hundreds of chardonnays but only a few lembergers or
scheurebes.
</P>
<P>
   Good wine judges work fast, sniffing, tasting and spitting, all
the while scribbling cryptic notes only they understand. Many wines
are never tasted; they are eliminated by smell. The best panels
usually include two or three people who have previously worked
together; in discussing each flight of wines, they understand each
other's remarks, which can be almost as cryptic as their notes.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco competition awards double gold, gold, silver,
and bronze medals. To receive a double gold, a wine must get a gold
meal from the panel that judges it in its own variety group, and
then another gold from the entire group of 42 judges, who compare
it with all the other gold medal winners.
</P>
<P>
   There were 35 double golds, or just over 1 percent of the wines
entered. There were 85 single golds, 327 silvers and 835 bronzes.
Seem like a lot of medals? It is. But wineries enter these
competitions to win medals; no medals, no entries. And the San
Francisco International is one of the roughest competitions. In
half-hearted defense of such largesse it can be said that wines in
general have improved considerably in recent years. What better
proof of that than the fact that so many relatively unknown wines
ended up in the winners' circle along with the thoroughbreds.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: Both the best merlot and the best syrah in the show
cost $8. What's more, both were from the same Australian winery,
Stonehaven Vineyards. The merlot was a 1999; the shiraz, a 1998. Of
course, in that part of the world, syrah is called shiraz.
</P>
<P>
   Other bests included, for riesling, a 1999 halbtrocken
(half-dry) from the Prinz von Hessen, from the Rheingau in Germany,
at $11; and for cabernet sauvignon, a 1997 Amberhill from Raymond
Vineyard in California at $10.
</P>
<P>
   It was especially heartening to see gold medals awarded to
nontraditional wines and nontraditional wine-producing regions.
They included a 1999 steinberg from the Stone Hill Winery in
Hermann, Mo., ($9) and a 1999 seyval blanc from another Missouri
producer, the St. James Winery in St. James ($10).
</P>
<P>
   A gold medal for Willie Frank's 1999 riesling from the
Konstantin Frank winery in the Finger Lakes ($10) strengthens my
feeling that one day, New York state could become the ultimate
source of fine rieslings in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the winners carried bargain basement prices. The best
dessert wine, a double gold winner, was a 1998 riesling icewine
from Jackson-Triggs Vintners in the Okanagan Valley in British
Columbia ($46). The best chardonnay was a 1998 single vineyard wine
from Mirassou Vineyards in Monterey County at $24; the best malbec,
a 1997 Alexander Valley wine from Geyser Peak in Sonoma at $20; the
best sparkling wine, a Gloria Ferrer 1992 brut from Freixenet in
the Carneros section of Sonoma at $22.
</P>
<P>
   Among the winners, there was a noticeable lack of famous names,
either from this country or certainly from France. If Anthony Dias
Blue, the wine and spirits editor of Bon Appetit Magazine, who runs
the San Francisco competition, persists in turning up low-priced
winners he may frighten off the powerhouse wine producers who can
ill afford to have a pack of upstarts ruffle their promotional
feathers.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the results of the competition would seem to
show that, shorn of their carefully constructed mystiques, their
beautiful labels and clever marketing, many expensive wines are
really not that much superior to their less-expensive rivals. Maybe
the veritas really is in the vino.

 &HT;    Veto aid bill with abortion 'gag rule'
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Anti-choice zealots in the U.S. House of
Representatives are at it again. Last week, on a vote of 221-206,
GOP conservatives killed a bipartisan effort to remove the
so-called ``gag rule,'' which bars mention of abortion by
international family planning organizations, from the annual
foreign aid bill. In effect, the provision bars those groups from
accepting much-needed U.S. aid.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 600,000 women around the world died from
pregnancy-related complications and lack of proper medical care. In
part because of lack of money, family-planning organizations in
Africa and Asia that offer birth control and prenatal care never
reached these women, some of whom are young teenagers. In effect,
Washington politicians are trading the lives of women and children
for political gain, while piously proclaiming themselves the
protectors of human life. What they are really protecting is the
GOP's far-right flank.
</P>
<P>
   Of Georgia's nine Republicans in Congress, only U.S. Rep. Johnny
Isakson was willing to stand up for women's reproductive health _
for the universal right of women to choose when to bear children
and how many to bear. Along with Georgia Democratic Reps. Cynthia
McKinney and John Lewis, Isakson voted in favor of an amendment
that would have stripped the gag rule out of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton threatened previously to veto the House
foreign-aid bill because it contains $1.8 billion less than he
requested for debt relief, economic and military assistance, AIDs
and health programs. The Senate version doesn't contain the onerous
anti-choice provision, but it shortchanges debt relief to an even
greater extent than the House bill. The president should exercise
his veto power if the gag rule isn't dropped and the funding
enhanced in upcoming budget negotiations.

I WROTE THIS COLUMN ON MY PALM PDA
</HEADLINE>
  By LONNIE BROWN   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the recent PC Expo, personal digital assistants were all the
rage _ with interest partly fueled by Microsoft's new PocketPC
operating system designed for PDAs with color screens and big
memory capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The real workhorses, however, are the Palm PDAs and and their
new siblings, the Visor from Handspring. The Palms have been around
for several years, and although the lower-end models lack color
screens, they still have crisp black-and-white displays, lots of
memory, and can provide weeks of service on two AAA batteries. They
also have a lower price: between $150 to $250 for basic models that
lack wireless capabilities, but will fulfill the needs of many
users.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm personal information managers are good for finding and
storing all sorts of information. A little larger than a deck of
playing cards _ but no thicker _ one can fit in a shirt pocket or
small purse. They hold addresses, telephone numbers, a to-do list,
and random information.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a memo function. And using it, and a small,
portable keyboard that the Palm plugs directly into, I was able to
write this entire column. The finished product was transferred from
the Palm to the office desktop computer using Palm's
synchronization cradle (which backs up all the information in the
Palm to a hard disk). Once in the office computer, the text was
transferred to the newspaper's word processor where it was then
turned into print.
</P>
<P>
   GoType! Pro from LandWare Inc. was the keyboard used. It has 62
keys and six function keys. The function keys are used just like
the function keys on the Palm to bring up the datebook, address
book, to-do list and search capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The keyboard is about a foot long (about twice the length of a
Palm IIIx) and about four inches wide (slightly wider than the
Palm). The Palm plugs into the keyboard, so the screen of the Palm
becomes a word-processing monitor. On either end of the keyboard is
a small holder for the Palm's pointing stylus, which must be used
occasionally _ mainly to highlight a choice on the Palm screen that
might not be available through pressing keys.
</P>
<P>
   Without the keyboard, I could have entered this review
letter-by-letter in the Palm. But that's no fun. The Palm's
graffiti (its term for the letter-making symbols) is easy enough
for entering small amounts of information. But it would take a
considerable amount of time to enter this much into the Palm using
the hand recognition method.
</P>
<P>
   But I can type nearly as fast on the GoType! keyboard as I can
on a full-size keyboard. There's no delay in getting the letters on
the Palm's screen and the time a key is pressed. The keyboard has
no batteries of its own. It uses the Palm's power, and it doesn't
seem to create any drain on the batteries.
</P>
<P>
   The keyboard also has a serial connector on its side, so it can
be used as a cradle for the Palm to synchronize the Palm with a
desktop computer. If you need two cradles _ one for home, one for
office _ it's an advantage worth considering.
</P>
<P>
   The keyboard comes with TakeNote, a word-processing program that
simplifies note taking with the keyboard, and WordSleuth, a
thesaurus program.
</P>
<P>
   The GoType! Pro keyboard is $70. Last week, LandWare had ``open
box'' keyboards that had been returned and refurbished for $45. For
information: www.landware.com.
</P>
<P>
   Palm's version of the keyboard is far different from the one
developed by LandWare. Its four hinged sections fold up to about
the size of the Palm organizer itself _ slightly larger than a
3-by-5-inch index card. Unfolded, it is the same size as a
full-size keyboard _ big enough to touch-type on, small enough to
fit on an airline tray. The keyboard sells for about $99.

VIRENQUE WINS FINAL ALPS SEGMENT OF TOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MORZINE, France _ Richard Virenque _ ``Ree-shar'' to nearly
every adolescent in France _ finally gave his fans something
concrete to celebrate Tuesday.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The French star has shone less brightly through the first 15
daily stages in this 21-stage, 87th Tour de France. But on the last
of three days in the Alps on Tuesday, he powered away on the final
climb, negotiated a tricky curve that wiped out his one companion
and easily finished first. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the Polti team and five-time winner of the king of
the mountains jersey in the Tour, Virenque credited the return of a
hot sun for his victory. Not that hot, actually _ temperatures atop
the last of five climbs barely reached 68 degrees Fahrenheit _ but
at least this was no longer the Tour of Frigid France, as it has
been since the start on July 1. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I like hot weather,'' Virenque said. ``I like the sun. I ride
best in hot weather.'' While the forecast until Sunday, when the
tour finishes in Paris, is for continuing sun and heat, there are
only small hills left to climb and he seems destined not to win a
sixth climbing jersey, tying the record. He ranks third in that
category. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, though, he fulfills another goal: In fifth place
overall, he is the highest-ranking Frenchman behind the continuing
leader, Lance Armstrong, the defending champion and chief of the
U.S. Postal Service team. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong did not have a good day. ``The hardest day of my life
on a bike,'' he called it after he finished eighth, 2 minutes, one
second behind the winner. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem was a `fringale,' '' he explained, using the
French word for a sudden loss of energy.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't eat enough and on the last climb had no energy,'' he
said. On the narrow alpine road, his team car could not get to him
to supply nourishment and he had no teammate with him to drop back
and fetch it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong started that climb, the 11.8-kilometer Joux Plane,
with an average grade of a steep 8.5 percent, in fine position just
behind an early breakaway that was leading the stage. He was about
a third of the way up, riding with Virenque and Jan Ullrich, the
German in second place, when he began to fall back. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His face strained and his pedaling uneasy for the first time in
this Tour, Armstrong continued to lose ground. Soon he was a minute
behind his two former companions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to limit my losses,'' he reported afterward. ``I
told myself to just stay in control and don't panic.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mission accomplished. His lead over Ullrich, who finished
second, shrunk two minutes to a still-safe 5:37. The German, the
leader of the Telekom team, gained a minute over the third-place
rider, Joseba Beloki, a Spaniard with Festina, who is now 6:38
behind Armstrong. In fourth place is Roberto Heras, a Spaniard with
Kelme and the rider who crashed into a barrier on a curve into the
resort of Morzine as he battled Virenque for the victory. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Frenchman is fifth, 7:36 behind, with Christophe Moreau, a
Frenchman with Festina, sixth, 8:22 behind.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Virenque was timed in 5 hours, 32 minutes and 20 seconds for the
196.5-kilometer (122-mile) 16th stage from Courchevel, a speed of
35 kilometers an hour. Ullrich was 24 seconds slower, with Heras
third, 27 seconds behind the winner. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The major wipeout of the day was Marco Pantani, the fine Italian
climber and leader of the Mercatone Uno team, who won the Tour in
1998. A day after he and Armstrong bickered about the race, Pantani
attacked on the first of the day's climbs, far earlier than he
usually does. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He built a lead of nearly two minutes, as if he was determined
to show Armstrong who was really boss, then fell apart. By the
final climb, he was at the tail end of the main group. Soon he was
going uphill at the speed of somebody bicycling to the grocery. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pantani finished in 38th place, 13:44 behind the winner, and
fell from sixth overall to 14th. Like Virenque, he has run out of
mountains.

THE ESSENCE OF SUMMER, SAVORED WITH A SPOON 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: recipes at end of article)  
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On nearly every dessert menu, sorbets are listed in
the very same way, in the very same place: ``assorted sorbets,'' at
the bottom, as if they were an afterthought or a compromise for
diners who don't want to commit to a whole dessert. The listing is
as appealing and nondescript as ``mixed green salad.''
</P>
<P>
   For many New York restaurants, it is an exercise in deceit.
Sorbet, in the hands of a good pastry chef, can be the most
thrilling flavor in a meal, and can be one of those culinary
miracles that actually improves on nature.
</P>
<P>
   Take the cantaloupe. Its flesh is pureed smooth, its flavor is
intensified so that it is more nectar than juice. Then, it is
chilled and churned so that it has the creaminess of caramel. It
becomes cantaloupe that is as refreshing as an iced drink, as
powerful as a shot of whiskey.
</P>
<P>
   It is what you hope to get from a melon bought at the store and
never really find, even at the Greenmarket. The transformation is
simple _ puree, season and freeze _ but what is captured is the
essence of the fruit and the palate of the cook in a way that no
other dessert can.
</P>
<P>
   A good sorbet should taste like an extraction of its main
flavor, and nothing else. It should be more gutsy than ice cream,
and more pure. There is no custard to compete with. Its substance
is formed by the main flavor, some sweetening and a little water.
There are almost no limitations on flavors; they can be summer
fruits like peaches, blackberries and nectarines, or spices,
chocolate, herbs or spirits. Some chefs have recently taken to
making almost-ice-cream sorbets with fromage blanc, sour cream or
even goat cheese. All of them are able to stand out without
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   If you were to ask about the ``assorted sorbets'' at Lespinasse,
the response would be startling. On a recent day, they had jasmine,
red hibiscus, litchi, fromage frais, apricot and orange-nepitella.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds more like a botanical garden inventory. But it's not
that chefs like Chris Broberg at Lespinasse are forcing
inventiveness. Sorbets are an ideal way for a flavor to express
itself, and they know it.
</P>
<P>
   Sono serves a cantaloupe sorbet but infuses it with an unusual
partner: star anise. Where the melon might droop, the anise picks
up. Where the anise might overwhelm, the cantaloupe dilutes it. As
an ice cream, it would have lacked poignancy.
</P>
<P>
   A fromage blanc-lemon grass sorbet at Vong strikes a similarly
surprising balance. The fromage blanc is tangy and blunt; the lemon
grass rounds out the edges and showers it with a floral, herbal
aroma that lingers in your mouth. At Eleven Madison Park, a
strawberry-moscato sorbet manages to eliminate the tartness of the
fruit and the cloyingness of the wine.
</P>
<P>
   Single flavors can be almost shocking in their purity. A
grapefruit sorbet at Brasserie tastes as though you're biting into
a very cold, perfectly ripened grapefruit without anything _ not
even a grain of sugar _ to distract you.
</P>
<P>
   But there are plenty of sorbets that taste more like flavored
water, or have enough sugar to give you a headache. Others,
especially those bought in the grocery store, can be gummy from
additives meant to keep them from turning icy.
</P>
<P>
   While sorbets are easy to make, they are also unforgiving.
Underripe strawberries will make a sorbet that tastes green and
bitter. Cheap sake will make a sorbet that tastes yeasty and has
the aroma of worn socks. Not exactly what most people want.
</P>
<P>
   Great ingredients are the only way around this. Wines and
spirits should be ones you would drink. Spices should be fresh.
Fruit should be in good condition and nearly overripe.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar is added for several reasons. It is a seasoning, like salt
in savory dishes. It balances acids, elevates the main flavor and,
of course, makes it a dessert. But it is also responsible for
creaminess in the texture. Without it, sorbet would be icy and
grainy.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to sweeten the main flavor without diluting it and
without making it, as contradictory as it sounds, sweet. And though
regular granulated sugar works, it must be dissolved in water first
and cooked into a syrup.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, this additional water can also dilute the
flavor, and too much sugar can oversweeten the base. Pastry chefs
tend to use a combination of sugar syrup and glucose or Trimoline.
These two are invert sugars, sweeteners in which the sucrose has
been broken down into glucose and fructose. They have a low
moisture content compared to sugar syrup and are less sweet than
granulated sugar. They also inhibit crystallization, making the
sorbet feel creamy once it's frozen rather than granular. They can
be difficult to find, but light corn syrup, also an invert sugar,
makes a good substitute.
</P>
<P>
   As with any seasoning, you must use your judgment when adding
these sweeteners. Tart blueberries, for example, may be watered
down by extra sugar syrup. So you may need to use less water in the
syrup or more corn syrup.
</P>
<P>
   In a sorbet that is more of an infusion, like the lime-rosemary
sorbet at Local, sweetness is needed to balance the acid in the
lime juice and give texture to the sorbet _ but it isn't meant to
upstage the heady scent of the rosemary.
</P>
<P>
   Sorbets made with starchy or densely textured fruits, like
papayas and bananas, do not need as much sugar for texture. At
Fressen, a pure papaya sorbet is very creamy but hardly sweetened
at all. It tastes as if you are scraping spoonfuls straight from
the fruit. For banana sorbet, Nicole Kaplan, the pastry chef at
Eleven Madison Park, actually roasts the fruit first (whole in its
skin with a few slashes so it doesn't explode) to break down its
starch.
</P>
<P>
   There is one other way _ though a less honest way _ to give
sorbet a creamy texture. You can add a lightly whipped egg white to
the sorbet in the ice cream maker, just before it finishes
churning. It makes the sorbet lighter and, some chefs claim,
creamier. But I find that it gives the sorbet a texture like that
of the head on a beer. It is full, light and annoyingly foamy.
</P>
<P>
   Once a sorbet base is mixed _ it is usually quite liquid _ it
should be tasted and adjusted much like a soup would be. Many fruit
sorbets, like jams and jellies, benefit from a splash of citrus
juice, which sharpens their flavor. In sorbets made with cream,
buttermilk or fromage blanc, you can add a pinch of salt.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the sorbet should be a little too intensely
flavored, because once it goes into the machine, it will change.
The machine whips air into the mixture and diminishes its flavor.
</P>
<P>
   When making sorbet at home, the biggest problem is usually the
ice cream maker. Many home models are rudimentary. They either
don't churn the sorbet enough or don't get cold enough, forcing you
to call it quits before the mixture is properly churned. Later, you
are left with a hard mass that you have to chip like a block of
ice.
</P>
<P>
   To get around this, it's best to chill the sorbet liquid before
adding it to the machine. This way, it doesn't warm up the freezing
container at the beginning. If the sorbet contains alcohol, which
acts as an antifreeze, you can pour it into a deep pan and light it
(carefully!) with a match to burn off the alcohol before adding it
to the sorbet mixture.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sorbets swirl around the container in the machine unchanged for
most of the churning, then turn slushy and eventually thick just at
the very end. Checking up on it during the first 20 minutes is
discouraging if nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   It's best to make small batches, so that you know it will freeze
quickly enough for your machine to whip it up well at the end. (It
should be thick and almost elastic-looking by the time it's done
churning.)
</P>
<P>
   But there is another reason to make small batches. You don't
want the sorbet to last too long. In good restaurants, sorbet is
made every day. Some even melt down the batch made in the morning,
readjust its flavor and then rechurn it before dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Sorbet is like any fresh fruit. Its flavor is fleeting. Its
texture is fragile. Its moment of intense purity is brief. You
should embrace it at its pinnacle, or not at all.

AOL, CITIGROUP FORM ONLINE PARTNERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Stock prices are not up-to-the-minute) 
 By JAMIE PATON   
 c.2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (For use by clients of The New York Times News Service)
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Recognizing the growing allure of the Internet for
online transactions, Citigroup (C:NYSE) said Tuesday that it had
formed a partnership with America Online (AOL:NYSE) aimed at giving
Internet users a broader array of financial options.
</P>
<P>
   Users of AOL, CompuServe and other AOL brands who make purchases
and auction transactions, as well as those who want to transfer
money between accounts, will be able to take advantage of the
payment and money transfer features beginning this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financial services are becoming more and more critical to the
online consumer,'' Sanford I. Weill, Citigroup's chairman and chief
executive, said in a statement, ``and AOL is an ideal partner to
reach those consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The multiyear pact will enable consumers to transfer money to
friends' and family members' accounts and send online payments to
merchants, the companies said. Citigroup, the New York-based
financial services company, also will serve as a clearinghouse for
Internet transactions across AOL media.
</P>
<P>
   ``By our own accounts, these sort of services do not currently
exist,'' said Nina Das, a Citigroup spokeswoman. ``Our goal is to
create a standard used in the business, and this is the first step
toward reaching that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup said it would use the alliance as a vehicle to provide
its banking, mortgage, loan and credit card services to its more
Internet-savvy customers. Citigroup products and services will be
promoted in the personal finance areas of AOL and several of the
services it operates, including Netscape, CompuServe and Digital
Cities.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Citigroup would promote AOL products and services on
the Web and through other channels, the companies said. AOL, based
in Dulles, Va., has more than 23 million members, while CompuServe
has about 2.7 million users in its fold.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's stock was trading in Tuesday early afternoon trading down
1 3/4, or 2.8 percent, to 61 1/4. Citigroup's shares were down
13/16, or 1 percent, to 65 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 merger of Citicorp and Travelers Group melded Citibank,
Travelers, Salomon Smith Barney, CitiFinancial and Primerica under
Citigroup's roof.

NOTHING LEFT BUT ITS ACCENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sorrel is that rare vegetable that becomes a sauce as it cooks,
adding a creamy texture and lemony flavor to any dish. And so it
could not be simpler as an unusual partner for braised chicken. Add
it to the pan toward the end of cooking, and it virtually
disintegrates into a tangy liquid.
</P>
<P>
   A leafy green that looks like flat-leaf spinach, sorrel is also
known as sour grass but actually has a delicate flavor. Its
tendency to liquefy when cooked has determined its destiny, usually
as an ingredient in sauces or soups.
</P>
<P>
   Raw sorrel is so sour that it can be used only as an accent.
Cooked, however, its strength is nearly perfect, mild enough that
it is traditionally teamed with fish, particularly salmon. But with
chicken it becomes the dominant flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Sorrel works especially well with the dark meat of chicken
because the acidity cuts the richness. But I like cooking white and
dark meat together to give people a choice. Braising keeps the
breasts from drying out.
</P>
<P>
   Sorrel is a perennial that survives Northeast winters and is in
season locally now. You can buy it at many Greenmarkets, farm
stands and good food stores, and at some supermarkets. The leaves
should look fresh and vibrant, not at all limp. For this recipe you
will need about one-half pound. Do not try to buy this quantity in
little herb packs. Look for bunches.
</P>
<P>
   Spinach is close to sorrel in many ways, and although it won't
fall apart as sorrel does in a sauce, it is the best substitute in
the recipe here. Sorrel does not keep as well as spinach and should
be used as soon after purchase as possible. Like spinach, it should
be washed well to remove any traces of grit.
</P>
<P>
   CHICKEN WITH SORREL
</P>
<P>
   Time: 40 minutes
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter or extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 2{- to 3-pound chicken, cut into serving pieces
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 large or 2 medium onions, peeled and cut into \-inch slices
</P>
<P>
   6 cups loosely packed sorrel, about { pound, trimmed and washed.
</P>
<P>
   1. Put butter in large skillet, preferably nonstick, and turn
heat to medium-high. When butter begins to melt, swirl it around
pan. When its foam subsides and it begins to brown, add the
chicken, skin side down. Cook, rotating pieces after 3 or 4 minutes
so they brown evenly. As they brown on the skin side, sprinkle them
with salt and pepper and turn them over; sprinkle skin side with
salt and pepper as well. If necessary, lower heat to medium to
prevent burning. Remove chicken to a plate when chicken is
completely browned all over, in 10 to 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   2. Immediately add onions to pan and cook, stirring
occasionally, until they begin to soften but still hold their
shape, about 5 minutes. Add { cup water and cook for a minute,
stirring occasionally, until it reduces slightly. Return chicken to
pan, turn heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for about 10
minutes. Uncover, add sorrel, stir, and cover again.
</P>
<P>
   3. Cook about 10 minutes longer, stirring occasionally, until
chicken is cooked through and sorrel is dissolved into onions and
liquid. Serve hot, with rice or crusty bread.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

SPECIALIZED PLAYTHINGS HELP KIDS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS LEARN (AND HAVE
FUN)
</HEADLINE>
  ATTN: Ill. 
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
 By JAVONNA MAY-MONS 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All kids love toys, but not all toys love all kids.
</P>
<P>
   Which is too bad. Toys are a great way for children to develop
skills essential to reasoning, self-esteem, movement and
socializing. And, of course, toys R fun.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, when Congress passed the Americans with
Disabilities Act mandating equal access to employment, public and
commercial facilities and healthcare, our legislators didn't add
any provisions about play toys. But the act did signal a sea change
in the way Americans thought about people with special needs.
</P>
<P>
   And soon, toy companies and retailers responded.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Toys R Us, the nation's No. 1 retail toy store, joined
forces with a nonprofit group called the National Lekotek Center to
create the ``Toys 'R' Us Toy Guide for DifferentlyAbled Kids!''
</P>
<P>
   Lekotek, a 40-year-old nonprofit group based in Evanston, Ill.,
is dedicated to engaging special-needs children in play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guide promotes the philosophy that play, laughter, fun and
toys should be universally enjoyed by every child _ including
children with special needs,'' says Beth Boosalis Davis, executive
director of the center. ``It minimizes the guesswork in selecting
appropriate toys, increases the potential for more fun and learning
opportunities, and builds on what a child can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Toys R Us sought Lekotek's help in creating the catalog because
of the center's special services: providing play sessions and toy
lending libraries for infants through 8-year-olds. The Lekotek
(loosely translated as ``play library'') concept was launched in
Sweden in the early 1960s by parents of disabled children who
banded together to share hard-to-find adapted toys. In 1980, the
first American Lekotek was launched in Evanston. Today, the
company's more than 60 nationwide play centers welcome children
with a wide range of disabilities such as Down syndrome, cerebral
palsy, sight or hearing loss, mental retardation, and chronic
conditions including HIV/AIDS and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The toy guide itself includes playthings for children with a
range of disabilities. Toys are selected on the basis of how they
meet developmental skill criteria, including: auditory, creativity,
fine motor, gross motor, language, self esteem, social, tactile,
thinking and visual skills. Although these guidelines for
playthings may seem appropriate for any child, they are extremely
important for disabled children, who are oftentimes late in
developing motor and social skills. Each entry in the guide
includes a picture of the toy and an explanation of which
developmental skills the toy helps the child with. For example, a
little boy in a wheelchair is shown wearing the Tech-Link Aviator
500, an electronic headset, which is said to promote social skills,
language and creativity.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Paweni, Lekotek marketing manager, explains a few of the
benefits this toy offers disabled children: ``It's good for speech
and language disorders because you're practicing how to
communicate. For the hearing impairments you can eliminate external
noise and increase the volume.''
</P>
<P>
   Before being accepted into the guide, toys must go through
thorough and rigorous trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our play experts review the toys and indicate what type of
disabilities it would work for,'' Paweni says. ``And they also
observe children and families playing with them. And we get
feedback from parents.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar collaboration took place between the American Toy
Institute _ a facet of the Toy Manufacturers of America that
solicits, collects and raises funds for children's charities _ and
the American Foundation for the Blind in 1993 when TMA President
David Miller proposed the idea. Each year the ATI and AFB issue the
``Guide to Toys for Children Who Are Blind or Visually Impaired.''
The guide features commercially available toys and games
appropriate for children of all ages who are blind or have low
vision or special needs.
</P>
<P>
   Again, children play an integral role in selecting the featured
toys. The AFB's guide's input comes from three special-needs
schools in the New York area that allow 75 to 100 children to
participate in the toy trials.
</P>
<P>
   David Miller ``came to the American Foundation for the Blind and
organized the testing of toys by blind children,'' said Elizabeth
Neal, AFB communications specialist. ``So basically our
organization set up appointments with schools for blind or visually
impaired children and brought in toys and had the kids play with
them. We took their assessment and made selections from that.''
</P>
<P>
   As attention to the play needs of special-needs children has
grown, new sources for toys have appeared on the market. One of the
most notable recent additions is Life's Little Helpers. The
company, which is based in Deerfield, Fla., is a branch of
Diabetic.com, a site dedicated to the medical needs of diabetics.
Life's Little Helpers has a print catalog and an online catalog
full of all sorts of products aimed at disabled people of all ages
_ including kids. Toys include everything from phones with both
Braille and large numbers to a Braille version of the popular board
game Battleship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of Braille items,'' said Gabrielle Ohayon,
director of new business. Ohayon said that people with diabetes
sometimes suffer from vision and walking problems. Life's Little
Helpers offers items to make their lives easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, we have a whistling football or volleyball that
people who are visually challenged can actually play (with) and
hear the ball whistle and guide themselves accordingly.''
(MORE) (A listing of 10 special toys for special-needs kids, and
tips for buying, both of which can run as separates.).
</P>
<P>
   Ten special toys for special-needs kids (unless otherwise noted,
all can be found at major toy retailers; prices are approximate):
</P>
<P>
   1. Peaceful Planet Soothing Sounds Bear
</P>
<P>
   With a gentle nudge or hug, this bear makes the sounds of
nature. Birds, crickets and babbling brooks lull kids to sleep
while giving them something soft to snuggle. A glowing sun on the
bear's chest creates a soft, comforting night light. The sounds
continue for about two minutes before the toy needs another hug.
This soft, cushy bear is great for children with visual impairments
because it gives them something solid to hold and makes soft
sounds, providing night-time comfort. $14.99.
</P>
<P>
   2. Leap Frog Explorer
</P>
<P>
   This globe from Leap Frog is a great educational tool. Touching
the NearTouch Magic Pen to any country gives the country's name. By
touching the country again, the child can learn facts such as the
country's population, capital and currency. Touching two countries
will give you the distance between the two. The globe features a
game called ``Eureka!,'' in which the globe gives a country's name
and the player has 45 seconds to find it. The globe has three
difficulty levels. In addition to that, the volume is adjustable _
a plus for hearing-impaired children. $99. (Life's Little Helpers
carries a similar toy called Geosafari Talking Globe Junior,
$99.95)
</P>
<P>
   3. Beeping foam balls
</P>
<P>
   Most children love playing with balls, and these soft foam,
beeping balls ensure that blind or visually impaired children won't
be left out. They are extremely safe to use and easy to find by
following the high-pitched beeping sound, which can also be turned
off. Available in soccer ball, Nerf football and 63/8-inch-diameter
round ball. Life's Little Helpers, $39.95
</P>
<P>
   4. Roller 2 in-line skates
</P>
<P>
   The popular sport of in-line skating can help with mastery of
gross motor skills, which is especially important for
developmentally delayed children. The boot is designed to be used
with shoes and has a sturdy, built-up ankle support. Parents can
choose from three settings: locked, forward only or freewheeling.
Adjustable wheel space allows the skates to move from a broad to a
narrow base. Skates can be adjusted to fit infant size 8 to
children's size 2. $19.99.
</P>
<P>
   5. Song Magic Banjo
</P>
<P>
   Barney's Song Magic Banjo provides musical, two-handed play for
kids who can hold onto the banjo. Although the banjo doesn't have
strings, a child has but to ``strum'' through its center for music
to play. Press the large button on its neck to select from eight
familiar songs or eight instrument sounds. The banjo can be held in
any position, ensuring that a child can use just one arm arm or a
leg to play. This toy is great for hearing-impaired children and
promotes fine motor skills and thinking. $24.99.
</P>
<P>
   6. Happy Stack
</P>
<P>
   Bright colorful tubes and zany happy faces make this
stack-'em-up game a favorite with babies. For developmentally
delayed kids, Happy Stack promotes fine motor skills by prompting
babies to use eye-hand coordination and two hands cooperatively to
stack the plastic pieces. The tubes may be stacked in any order
your child pleases. The peekaboo heads on each piece eliminate the
pole that many children have difficulty reaching over when placing
the tubes. The peekaboo heads also serve as a natural handle,
allowing kids to better manipulate the pieces. $7.99
</P>
<P>
   7. Frontier Fort Lincoln Logs
</P>
<P>
   Building this log cabin promotes fine motor skills and
creativity. The play set contains wooden logs, ladder, figures and
instructions for creating different layouts, including multiple
buildings complete with plastic roofs, doors and windows. Children
can let their imagination run wild and practice language skills by
telling a story while building. $19.99
</P>
<P>
   8. Braille alphabet blocks
</P>
<P>
   Classic wood blocks embossed with letters and corresponding
Braille cells can help blind or visually impaired children learn
their alphabet. The 27 colorful blocks include realistic animal
drawings, letters and numbers on the other sides. Life's Little
Helpers, $27.95
</P>
<P>
   9. Chinese checkers
</P>
<P>
   Chinese checkers introduces the concept of competition. Children
will learn how to play against opponents without trying to
purposely set them back. Simple instructions keep youngsters who
aren't yet reading from feeling frustrated. This game promotes fine
motor skills, social skills and thinking. $2.99.
</P>
<P>
   10. Vortex Power Bat
</P>
<P>
   The people who brought us Koosh balls are responsible for the
Vortex Power Bat, a lightweight bat and plastic ball. The bat has
an easy-to-grasp, textured handle and a large hitting surface. The
ball is a bright fluorescent orange, making it easy to see and
find. Children can practice gross motor skills and increase their
self-esteem with a home run. $19.99. ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Shopping for special-needs kids
</P>
<P>
   The National Lekotek Center offers 10 tips to keep in mind when
buying toys for children with disabilities:
</P>
<P>
   1. Multisensory appeal
</P>
<P>
   Does the toy respond with lights, sounds or movement to engage
the child? Are there contrasting colors? Does it have a scent? Is
there texture?
</P>
<P>
   2. Method of activation
</P>
<P>
   Will the toy provide a challenge without frustration? What is
the force required to activate? What are the number and complexity
of steps required to activate?
</P>
<P>
   3. Where the toy will be used
</P>
<P>
   Will the toy be easy to store? Is there space in the home? Can
the toy be used when the child is in a variety of positions, such
as lying on his or her side or in a wheelchair?
</P>
<P>
   4. Opportunities for success
</P>
<P>
   Can play be open-ended with no definite right or wrong way? Is
the toy adaptable to the child's individual style, ability and
pace?
</P>
<P>
   5. Current popularity
</P>
<P>
   Is it a toy that will help the child with disabilities feel like
``any other kid?'' Does it tie in with other forms of
entertainment, such as books and art sets, that promote other forms
of play?
</P>
<P>
   6. Self-expression
</P>
<P>
   Does the toy allow for creativity, uniqueness and choice-making?
Will it give the child experience with a variety of mediums?
</P>
<P>
   7. Adjustability
</P>
<P>
   Does it have adjustable height, sound volume, speed and level of
difficulty?
</P>
<P>
   8. Child's individual characteristics
</P>
<P>
   Does the toy provide activities that reflect the child's
interest and age?
</P>
<P>
   9. Safety and durability
</P>
<P>
   Consider the child's size and strength. Is the toy
moisture-resistant? Can it be washed and cleaned?
</P>
<P>
   10. Potential for interaction
</P>
<P>
   Will the child be an active participant during use? Will the toy
encourage social engagement?

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Internal bleeding and liver failure caused Allan
Bloom's death in 1992, according to his obituary. The conservative
critic and author of ``The Closing of the American Mind'' comes to
life again, then dies of AIDS as a character in Saul Bellow's new
novel, ``Ravelstein.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellow and Bloom were close friends, but Bellow has been accused
by numerous critics of outing Bloom and betraying his friendship.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Paul Theroux wrote a book on his mentor and close
friend V.S. Naipaul. No disturbing outing here, but Theroux paints
an unflattering portrait of Naipaul as an insufferable lout with a
``sour mouth'' and ``cheated eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Literary feuds are commonplace, but usually among writers who
knife each other at a distance and were never buddies. Like Mary
McCarthy's famous _ or infamous _ denunciation of Lillian Hellman:
``Every word she writes is a lie, including `and' and `the.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the art of betrayal, writers have it made. Instead of going
to jail for assault and battery, they get to splatter blood all
over the page, which then becomes the hot item of the week to read,
followed by television appearances which enhance the stature of the
writer.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, the writer gets paid for the hit job.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not trying to come off high and mighty here. Quite the
opposite. I can't get enough of these betrayals. I recall trembling
with excitement when I spotted a review of a book by Norman
Podhoretz, a heavyweight in Manhattan intellectual circles for more
than 50 years. The title alone had me running to the bookstore:
``Ex-Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   I was not disappointed. Podhoretz blasts away at Lionel
Trilling, Lillian Hellman and Mary McCarthy, Allen Ginsberg, Norman
Mailer, Hannah Arendt, Hans J. Morgenthau and other literary lights
with whom he shared highballs and lofty ideas until his own views
shifted from left to right in the late '60s.
</P>
<P>
   When somebody does the switcheroo in politics, too often the
fallout is personal. Although I enjoy reading about writers doing
each other in, it is sad when differences of opinion keep them
apart. What another critic said about Bloom's ``The Closing of the
American Mind'' is a perfect retort to the writer who turns on a
friend for the ``wrong'' politics: What we really have here is the
closing of AN American mind.
</P>
<P>
   I don't believe all those with bright minds and sharp pens have
mean hearts, but you have to wonder if these writers are capable of
true friendship. I suspect what is taking place in these bondings
is cheap office politics in a refined setting.
</P>
<P>
   Writers use each other as stepping stones, a mutual aid society
to get on the inside track. The meaningful conversation at the
party where One Must Be Seen provides not only intellectual
stimulation, but access to the movers and shakers at the party.
(Strange too, these distinguished writers sucking up to each other
in the Friendly First Stage, and then writing amusing anecdotes
about has-beens and hangers-on and sycophants circling around
important people at the party.)
</P>
<P>
   In ``Ex-Friends,'' Podhoretz tells us he turned down an
invitation to Norman Mailer's 75th birthday party because the
author ``had so bitterly disappointed my literary expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   I can't read Podhoretz's mind, but I'm tempted to say every word
in that quote is a lie.
</P>
<P>
   But the quote speaks volumes. He wants us to know he got an
invitation many would covet. Better yet, he gets to tell us he
doesn't need it and for good measure can shove it back down
Mailer's throat.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, he's letting us know he's a man of high principles
who doesn't need to suck up to Mailer.
</P>
<P>
   With friends like Podhoretz . . .

&HT;     SORRY, IT WAS A SENIOR MOMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEPHANIE SALTER

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The subject has replaced all others in my circle
of friends and acquaintances. Finances, kids, spouses, partners,
religion and politics all take a backseat to Topic A:
</P>
<P>
   Forgetting.
</P>
<P>
   Put two or more people of my age group _ baby boomers _
together, and the embarrassing, mystifying, sad stories abound. One
by one, each woman or man steps forward to recount her or his
latest ``senior moment'' _ a colossal memory or attention lapse.
</P>
<P>
   Always, the confessions are accompanied by a bewildered shaking
of the head, as if the teller were describing something that was
visited upon her or him.
</P>
<P>
   Like an alien inhabitation.
</P>
<P>
   Always, one confession inspires another:
</P>
<P>
   ``You think THAT'S bad, let me tell you what I did . . .''
</P>
<P>
   And almost always, someone pipes up with a well-meaning but
totally unsuccessful attempt at consolation:
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you think it's just because we live in such distracting,
stressful times? Because we just have too much in our heads?''
</P>
<P>
   No, it is because we are getting older, and getting older means
never having to say, ``You can count on me; I'll remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Legions of experts work on various drugs, programs, exercises,
supplements and voodoo dances that might help millions of us
mitigate the unraveling of our brains.
</P>
<P>
   They suggest we ``make lists.''
</P>
<P>
   I make lists, then forget to check them. Or forget where I put
the lists.
</P>
<P>
   Now that I have a computer, I could put the lists there. But a
recent experience while on vacation scared me off of that. I tried
to sign on as a ``guest'' on AOL at my parents' house, but I had
forgotten my password.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's help line gave me a temporary password to get me into my
own e-mail, but _ without my real password _ I couldn't access my
personal address book.
</P>
<P>
   What good is e-mail without one's e-mail address book? Like I'm
expected to remember e-mail addresses when I can't even remember my
own password?
</P>
<P>
   Another memory expert suggests that we can better remember or
focus on things if we can ``incorporate them into a story.''
</P>
<P>
   I write ``stories'' for a living. Just last week, I wrote
``Julie Christy'' in a column when I meant to write ``June
Christy.'' Alas, both are blonds, but Julie Christie is a film
actress and June Christy was a singer with Stan Kenton's band.
</P>
<P>
   Last month I wrote that I started working at this newspaper in
1975, when I clearly knew that I began in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of good it does me to incorporate information into
stories.
</P>
<P>
   But, as I mentioned a few paragraphs back _ remember? _ I know
I'm not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of Gingko biloba, an herbal supplement that is rumored to
aid memory but has never been proven to do so, now top $250 million
a year in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Health food store shelves are stocked with products with names
like ``Deep Thought'' and ``Brain Gum.'' Bookstores carry titles
like ``Why Can't I Remember? Reversing Normal Memory Loss.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, an entrepreneur is launching a chain of ``memory
centers,'' hoping to become the Fantastic Sam's of short-term
recall.
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes me feel better. When it comes to forgetting,
misery does love company.
</P>
<P>
   Like the New England professor not long ago who apologized
profusely for not calling me back at the appointed time of our
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so sorry,'' she said, ``These days I have Swiss cheese for
brains.''
</P>
<P>
   I so liked that image (and remembered it) that I have used it
several times since, as my own excuse, or to bring some small
amount of comfort to someone similarly afflicted.
</P>
<P>
   Take my friend Jackie.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to me describe a humbling incident involving a
neighbor's garage door, Jackie delivered the official ``senior
moment'' preface:
</P>
<P>
   ``You think THAT'S bad . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Then she told of a horrific realization she had as she stood
near the copying machine in her office with a plate of food (her
lunch) in one hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just about to turn the plate over on the Xerox machine
when something in me said, `Wait! This is wrong.' I almost Xeroxed
my lunch!''
</P>
<P>
   Swiss cheese indeed.
</P>

&HT;     NO SMOKING GUN IN THIS ASHTRAY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By LYSSA FRIEDMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ On Friday, a Miami jury gave its verdict in a
class-action suit against the tobacco industry, the first to go to
trial: a $145 billion judgment for the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Representing more than 300,000 smokers, attorneys sued five
cigarette makers, claiming they ruined the lives of their sick and
addicted customers.
</P>
<P>
   If only I could cash in on the big winnings. At last I'd have
someone to blame for my father's youthful death three decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dad's cigarettes were part of family life. He woke up, showered,
looped his tie and inhaled the day's first Alpine while gulping
coffee and reading the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   You could map Dad's movements by his trail of menthol stubs.
</P>
<P>
   A glass ashtray overflowed next to the newspaper on his
nightstand. Embers dropped from the ceramic dish, contoured with
cigarette-nesting concavities, beside the paperbacks on his reading
table. Dad filled a beanbag ashtray in the breakfast nook and
another in the bathroom. Filters tumbled from the pullout
compartment of his Mercury and spilled onto the bench seat.
</P>
<P>
   When my mother carried home sacks of groceries, gallons of milk
nestled against cartons of cigarettes. When I helped her with
housework, I followed her from room to room, emptying ashtrays and
dusting ash from tabletops.
</P>
<P>
   My father's bathroom noises _ the shower, the electric razor _
would have seemed incomplete without the clearing of his throat and
the hacking cough.
</P>
<P>
   Dad noticed those first warnings on cigarette packs and the
early stop-smoking ads in the Times. When his talk radio station
waged a quit smoking campaign, he joined. For a month or two it was
as if spring windows had been thrown open through the house,
cleansing the odor of smoke from clothing and bed linens.
</P>
<P>
   But soon he restarted. My best sixth grade friend destroyed her
father's Marlboros by stashing them in the freezer. I admired her
activism, but I knew if I threw Dad's out, he'd buy more. My father
would change when he was ready, not when I pressured him to.
Besides, other fathers had heart attacks, not mine.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, an ambulance whisked Dad to the emergency room. I
imagine now a nurse pushing against his chest, another injecting
medication into his vein, a doctor shouting orders. And I picture
my mother sobbing in the waiting room as my father waved his last
goodbye in a curling wisp.
</P>
<P>
   After he died, Mom shipped Dad's ties to Goodwill and his
paperbacks to the library. But it was when his Alpines were tossed
out, followed by his ashtrays, that I palpated his absence.
</P>
<P>
   I sat next to his reading table and rubbed my thumbnail against
the place where his ceramic ashtray once sat. All that remained was
a black streak burned permanently into the veneer. It marked the
place where, while he dozed, his cigarette had rolled carelessly
onto the oak surface.
</P>
<P>
   During adolescence I railed against the father who abandoned me,
against the mother who erased his presence by throwing his remnants
in the trash and against companies like Philip Morris and R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Co., whom I believed to be manufacturers of
murder.
</P>
<P>
   And now that I've reached adulthood, I could organize a
Miami-like class-action lawsuit in California. I could hold the
cigarette makers responsible for blowing loss through my young
being like smoke curling from a lit tip.
</P>
<P>
   But I won't. Let the Florida plaintiffs amass their fortunes.
Adulthood has taught me that no one is untouched by death.
</P>
<P>
   Dad's death is a fact of my life. Holding a cigarette maker
accountable neither restores Dad's life nor changes the trajectory
of mine.

&HT;     METAL DECTORS SET TO `STUN' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If you are of a certain age, you probably
remember your first flight on an airliner as fondly as I do.
Getting there was more than half the fun, and unlike ocean liners,
you got there quickly with no boring shuffleboard.
</P>
<P>
   To put it in terms kids might understand today, airliners were
limos in the sky, and passengers dressed accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   In that fading golden summer of 1964, I was 18 and took my first
flight from Boston to Miami, and then on to San Salvador, Guatemala
City and Tegucigalpa. The stewardesses treated my friends and me
like the young princes we thought we were. The pilots even got off
with us for an hour at the San Salvador airport and we all played
slot machines together.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury and intimacy, that's what airlines gave you then. Now we
get intimacy of the unwanted kind, and airliners are Trailways
buses with wings. We're crammed up against beefy guys in sandals
and shorts. We're forced to wait at metal detectors and in lounges
where lounging is impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Our privacy is invaded, as agents ask impertinent questions
like, ``Did you pack your bags yourself?'' and ``Have your bags
been out of your sight?''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months I've flown cross country about 10 times,
and I have to stop myself from answering, ``I left it for a couple
of hours at militia headquarters.''
</P>
<P>
   No jokes allowed. You're in the high security world of flying,
and you should feel insecure. You'll be slammed up against the wall
and thrown in the clink for not taking terrorism seriously enough.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that airports and airlines are the ones taking people
hostage, millions a day. Forget the fact that planes get knocked
out of the skies over America not by bombs in carry-on bags, but
because of bad wiring, stripped tail stabilizer screws and ground
crews who pack oxygen canisters with old tires.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, we're treated like criminals and have to walk
repeatedly through metal detectors set between ``navel ring'' and
``surgical pin,'' while our luggage is being X-rayed by
minimum-wage employees who meet two job qualifications:
humorlessness and a supple wrist for thrusting electronic wands
into intimate places.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the city of San Francisco has required its
Cleveland-based security contractor to pay a minimum of $9 an hour
to airport security guards. Presumably this will lead to more
professional wandsmanship and more sophisticated senses of
humorlessness.
</P>
<P>
   It's amazing the stuff that does or doesn't get through the
X-ray machine. The last time I flew out of Boston back to San
Francisco, I brought a duffel bag full of antique glass and a
nautical clock. The bags went right though the X-ray machine. I
suppose terrorists use solid state these days instead of wind-up
clocks, and can't afford to use Sandwich glass as shrapnel.
</P>
<P>
   Before a flight a few months ago, a security guard opened a
drawer filled with objects taken from passengers. Among them was a
toy gun that was very obviously a toy, but confiscating it was
understandable.
</P>
<P>
   People who let their kids take toy guns onto planes should have
their kids confiscated. In fact, all kids under the age of 8 should
be confiscated before flights.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the stuff the security guards confiscate is ridiculous.
There in the drawer was a Swiss Army knife, a small one that didn't
even have the deadly assault corkscrew. As if someone would say,
``Take me to Cuba or I'll start auguring, filing and toothpicking
passengers.''
</P>
<P>
   When was the last time a plane was hijacked in this country at
all? And many planes deserve to be hijacked. ``Get me off this
taxiway and take me to my destination.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, a security guard at San Francisco spotted an object
that looked like a pistol as it went through the X-ray machine.
Actually, it dawned on the security guard a little late that the
object might have been a Glock (or a Super Squirter), and the bag
was gone by the time the alert was sounded.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in the terminal had to be evacuated, and then
readmitted, after being more carefully inspected and wanded. Like
lots of things in America, it was in the name of security. Why is
it we don't feel secure?
</P>
<P>
   The political-military-industrial complex is terrorizing us into
believing there are terrorists everywhere, even though a report
published in the Wall Street Journal showed only 58 Americans
killed by ``international terrorists'' in the last five years
compared to 400 killed between 1983 and 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorists lately have tended to be homegrown, and preferred
rental trucks as delivery systems. But our leaders are still
defending against skyjackers. Now they want the military to operate
against terrorists in our cities, as well as in outer space to keep
us safe from pee-wee ``rogue states,'' recently renamed ``states of
concern.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm in a state of concern. Whenever I travel, I face long lines
at beeping machines, interminable delays in the terminal, and all
those guys with hairy legs in shorts and sandals. No amount of
officious ``security'' will stop a guy who really wants to blow up
my plane.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that will save me is that when it happens,
chances are I'll still be waiting in a stupor in the lounge,
terrorized by a Mr. and Mrs. T's Bloody Mary.

&HT;     NINERS DRAFTEE HAS ESPRIT DE CORPS

<P>
   STOCKTON, Calif. _ When John Milem was a Marine recruit, his
drill instructor at Parris Island in South Carolina would make the
young man get on his knees. Then the sergeant would stand on
Milem's footlocker. All this so the DI could look down on him.
</P>
<P>
   Milem is a 6-foot-9, 290-pound defensive end in San Francisco
49ers training camp, a tough former barroom bouncer who looks like
the typical Marine _ only bigger and stronger.
</P>
<P>
   He was a physical mismatch for his whippet-like DI, who wasn't
much more than 5-feet tall. Milem is in more natural surroundings
on the practice fields of the University of the Pacific, where he
is just one more oversized NFL rookie defensive lineman. Of course,
most rookies aren't 25 years old and coming into the league with
just two years of Division II experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a lot of looks from colleges when I came out of high
school,'' Milem said. ``I didn't feel I was ready. I was a young
kid, a wild kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Milem decided he needed discipline, so he tried the Marine
Corps. Did it work? ``Yes sir.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Marine Corps he had a job as a bouncer at a bar in
Charlotte, N.C. One night an old friend who was playing football at
tiny Division II Lenoir-Rhyne came into the bar. He suggested Milem
go out for the team.
</P>
<P>
   Big, strong and fast (he's been timed at a sub-4.7 40), Milem
started every game his freshman year, sat out his sophomore year
with a shoulder injury, then started every game again his junior
year. Then he left school for the NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers, desperate for defensive linemen, selected the
unheralded Milem in the fifth round. The line will be the subject
of a rebuilding job at camp and coaches hope to utilize Milem's
speed, quick feet and pass-rushing skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a world of potential,'' said defensive coordinator
Jim Mora.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being 25 years old could work to his advantage,'' coach Steve
Mariucci said. ``Hopefully he's not overwhelmed by this. He's
mature.''
</P>
<P>
   Many rookies come into the league with five years (including a
redshirt season) at big Division I football schools. Mora, noting
``everybody can't come from Ohio State or Michigan,'' said he is
not overly concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something he'll be able to overcome quickly because he's
smart,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Milem said while he lacks the experience of having played for a
big-time football program, he did survive ``a lot of ground
pounding'' on 25-mile marches and ``standing in the woods three
weeks at a time'' in the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   He also dismisses the age difference, saying he is as fresh as
any rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not that old in football,'' he said. ``I wasn't in
Division I five years getting pounded.''

 &HT;    RESENDING TO CHANGE FCC IN 2ND GRAF TO FAA
 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Ads in airliners just don't fly
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a move afoot to plaster ads on the overhead luggage bins
in airliners and it's hard to imagine that carriers that have
degraded air travel into flying steerage will pass up a new
opportunity to turn a buck.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration is mulling the idea, and
Advent AirAds says only one small line, Vanguard, has committed so
far, but just you wait. If the FAA goes along, it won't be long
before the major airlines cite -- with reluctance, they will say --
competitive pressures as forcing them into the placard racket.
</P>
<P>
   The ads would complete the process of making airliners
distinguishable only by their altitude from buses.
</P>
<P>
   And would add to the process by which advertisers are contriving
to get in your face every waking moment of your life.
</P>
<P>
   Time was when communities took pride in their municipal
facilities. The auditorium, arena or theater wore either its
community's name or memorialized admired figures of its civic
adventure. Now we have stadia whose monikers are auctioned to
corporate vainglory, without any thought to local relevance, their
identities as fungible as the deracinated teams that play in them.

   Just imagine the loss to history if the Roman Coliseum had come

   This is actually, really true: the leading mayoral candidate in
Atlanta wants the city to can the sentimentality and let the
highest commercial bidder brand the city's airport, currently
Hartsfield International, named for the visionary mayor who made
Atlanta the hub-de-la-hub of air travel.

   Public TV and radio used to offer sanctuary from incessant
commercial drumming, but their discreet credit lines for
public-spirited supporters have metamorphosed, like one of those
out-of-control bugs in a horror movie, into de facto commercials
different from the networks' only by being, as yet, a shade more
mannerly.
</P>
<P>
   In some cities, advertisers are paying private motorists to
paste ads on their cars. Expect the practice to spread.

   A Russian space rocket recently went up bearing the new logo for
Pizza Hut. (The logo was being launched. Get it?)

   Movie theaters hit you for tickets, charge you Pentagon prices
for soft drinks and popcorn and then make you sit through
commercials before you even get to the previews _ which are, of

   The conversion of airliners into advertising tubes would, I
suppose, add only a small abuse, but why stop there? Couldn't the
stewardesses, between the safety and drink-cart drills, read
commercials over the P.A.?

&HT;     POLO CLUB BOSS HOPES TO LURE MORE SPECTATORS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DENNIS YUSKO  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ The new owner of Saratoga Polo Club is
investing $1.5 million in improvements and charging significantly
more for memberships to raise Saratoga polo to a world-class level.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping to attract the best teams in the country, as well
as from abroad,'' said polo pioneer William Ylvisaker, former
chairman of the U.S. Polo Association.
</P>
<P>
   In return, watching and playing local tournament polo at the
greens suddenly became more expensive: Membership fees have risen
by as much as 66 percent in some cases and additional family member
passes have tripled in price this year.
</P>
<P>
   But members say the price increase will be worth it if the club
rises to Ylvisaker's standards as promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fee structure was an issue to some people,'' said Gene
Gass, who renewed his Players Membership for the seventh year
despite the jump in prices. Gass, who plays on one of the local
teams at the club, said tournament entry fees doubled this season
from last year.
</P>
<P>
   Since Ylvisaker purchased the club from BMHD Inc. in December,
he has hired Memo Gracida, whom he calls the best polo player in
the world, to direct the club and has negotiated a 65-acre-lease
arrangement with nearby Skidmore College that will bring the number
of playing surfaces to seven next year.
</P>
<P>
   Ylvisaker, a business magnate and the founder of Florida's Palm
Beach Polo and Country Club, hopes the additional fields and
soon-to-be-opened clubhouse that contains a 90-seat restaurant will
pay off in increased spectator interest and bring another top-notch
equestrian sport to the city.
</P>
<P>
   The new clubhouse is due to be completed by the end of this
month. It will offer food, beverages, meeting rooms and, for the
first time in the club's long history, restrooms.
</P>
<P>
   That's good news to Ronald Friske, 59, a Saratoga Springs
resident and polo fan, who has been paying the general admission
price to watch matches for the past 15 years and was one of the
only fans present at Wednesday's match _ the start of the club's
102nd season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be nice to have somewhere to go once the rains come,''
Friske said.
</P>
<P>
   Polo is played between eight players, four to a squad. Players
ride horses and try to hit a ball through a goal with mallets.
</P>
<P>
   Matches are played on a 300-by-160-yard field. The game is
divided into six periods of seven minutes each and typically lasts
up to two hours, Ylvisaker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the `20-goal level' (best players), this is one of the four
or five top places for polo at this time of the year,'' said the
club's new manager, Tony Coppola.
</P>
<P>
   Ylvisaker explains the price increases by pointing out that this
season will offer more matches with higher-quality players, and
general admission prices have not changed _ staying at the $5 per
person or $15 per carload price.
</P>
<P>
   ``In dollar amounts, yes, they are more, but there are so many
additional benefits,'' including the competitive 20-goal
tournaments in July and August that feature all-star international
players, Ylvisaker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to attract anybody. A lot of people think it's
exclusive, but it really isn't. It's very much open to the public.
People ask me, `Can I come?' I say, `Of course.' Years back, the
sport may have been known as exclusive, but that's really not the
case anymore,'' Ylvisaker said.
</P>
<P>
   The club's annual corporate membership fee, which admits six,
has increased from $600 to $1,000. Annual family membership at the
club, which admits two adults and children 16 and under and
includes six free guest passes, has increased from $290 to $380
(with additional family member passes jumping from $50 to $180),
and single membership fees increased by $45 to $260.

CLINTON CALLS FOR NEW MIDEAST SUMMIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With little time left to broker a Middle East peace
deal, President Clinton Wednesday called a high-risk, high-level
Palestinian-Israeli summit at Camp David next Tuesday meant to
prevent the peace process from wasting away from lack of use.
</P>
<P>
   ``To delay this gathering, to remain stalled, is simply no
longer an option,'' Clinton told reporters at the White House after
announcing that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat had accepted his invitation to a summit at the
presidential retreat.
</P>
<P>
   The decades-old conflict ``can move forward toward real peace,
or it can slide back into turmoil. It will not stand still,'' the
president said. ``If the parties do not seize this moment, if they
cannot make progress now, there will be more hostility and more
bitterness, perhaps even more violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for major advancement in the peace talks appeared dim,
with the chief Palestinian negotiator, Ahmed Korei, predicting the
summit would fail. ``The Israeli position is known and will not
change, and the Palestinian position is clear and it, too, will not
change,'' Korei said.
</P>
<P>
   While Barak welcomed the invitation, he was met with defiance at
home. Two parties in Barak's ruling coalition said Wednesday they
would leave his government ahead of the summit, a move that could
seriously undermine the prime minister as he seeks necessary
support for a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also seemed unusually subdued in announcing what he may
have hoped to present as a breakthrough. Camp David was the site of
the historic 1978 talks, headed by President Jimmy Carter, that
resulted in a watershed agreement between Israel and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no easy answers, and certainly no painless ones,''
Clinton said. ``And therefore, there is clearly no guarantee of
success.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials downplayed the significance of
the disruption in Israeli politics after the summit announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone here is denying that it will occupy some
of his attention prior to the meeting,'' a diplomatic source said,
referring to Barak. But the Israeli leader ``has the mandate of the
people,'' which is more important, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that a constituency here, or a constituency there,
wants to pull out (of the government) doesn't interfere with what
he wants,'' said Jonathan S. Paris, a fellow with the Middle East
Project of the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations. ``If he
comes back with a peace agreeement, the people will really rally
around him.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators will arrive this weekend for preliminary meetings,
and Barak and Arafat will get together on Tuesday, White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said. Clinton will cancel or postpone some
planned events, but he is not completely clearing his schedule for
the summit, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no time frame for the meetings, but both diplomatic
officials and analysts predicted the summit would go for several
days. Clinton is committed to attending the G-8 economic conference
in Japan the week after the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he called the summit for next week because he was
convinced that no further progress could be made unless Barak and
Arafat were personally involved. ``While Israeli and Palestinaian
negotiators have made real progress . . . the truth is they can
take the talks no further at their level,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Action does have its perils, but so too does inaction,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official likened the peace process to a
bicycle: If it stops completely, it will fall down, and it will be
much more difficult to get it up and running again. But if it is
moved continuously, however slowly, there is a better chance of
making it to the desired destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a tough go. That's the reality,'' said the
official, who asked to remain anonymous. But ``if we don't go to a
summit, the process will stay where it is,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis and Palestinians have been negotiating for nearly seven
years to settle an array of differences on issues including
borders, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of Palestinian
refugees and Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
   The beleaguered peace process is running up against critical
deadlines. Arafat has warned that unless the two sides meet a
self-imposed Sept. 13 deadline for an agreement, Palestinians will
unilaterally declare their own state. That would almost certainly
prompt a dramatic reaction from Israel, including the annexation of
some West Bank lands, and raise the possibility of clashes between
Israeli and Palestinian forces.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has his own deadline as well. With barely six months
left in office, the president has little time to broker an
agreement, and then convince Congress to approve the huge aid
packages that are expect to accompany such a deal.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton is not successful, the next president _ whoever it is
_ starts at a disadvantage. Clinton has spent a great deal of time
and personal effort in attempting to bring peace to the Middle
East, and has won the confidence of many of the players in the
region. The new US president would have to build his own
relationships, likely delaying the process.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would also benefit from the positive element a peace
deal would add to his legacy as president, although his aides
insist he is not motivated by ensuring his place in history.
</P>
<P>
   The president has had successes in the process, including
bringing Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to the
White House, where the two longtime foes shook hands in 1993. Rabin
was assassinated in 1995, and the peace agreement unraveled.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli-Palestinian summit may well not produce a hard
agreement, but may keep the process alive and thus avoid a
potentially disastrous confrontation in September, said Anthony H.
Cordesman, a former senior Pentagon official now with the
Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the conference fails, it is likely that a slower,
lower-profile process would have failed as well,'' Cordesman said.

GOP'S ABORTION WRANGLE BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; _ Trent Lott says flat out that George W. Bush
will pick a right-to-life politician as his running mate, probably
in about a week.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: The Senate's majority leader is disguising a strong
recommendation as a prediction, giving more prominent voice to the
views of many conservatives that abortion is the kind of issue that
does not permit the ultimate form of ticket splitting.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan is saying that Governor Bush doesn't have the nerve
to pick a prochoice running mate, such as Pennsylvania Governor Tom
Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: The wily coyote is trying to goad Bush into picking
Ridge, an act that in addition to the turmoil it would generate in
the GOP world would also help give some right-to-life juice to
Buchanan's Reform Party candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-Ridge Republicans, meanwhile, have gone to ground in the
face of the conservatives' negative onslaught. Bush himself tries
to be nice to his pal in public, but even that effort is starting
to appear forced, and his meeting with prochoice Governor George
Pataki of New York last week had the stench of bone-tossing
symbolism.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: As the prochoice forces prepare themselves for
another loss on the GOP platform, there is simply no sign that Bush
is willing to take on the party's religious right.
</P>
<P>
   The overall meaning of the latest tea leaf events is that
because the countdown to the GOP convention has begun, and because
the veep selection is imminent, the wrestling match with abortion
rights has begun. It is one of the principal table-settings for the
convention itself because both the veep and the platform will be
the news events before the convention opens.
</P>
<P>
   The fact remains that no prochoice Republican has come within an
inch of the vice presidency in the 20 years since the bizarre
events in Detroit when Ronald Reagan picked Bush's father. The
elder Bush went from prochoice to right-to-life on the spot, never
explained himself, and never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of how much damage this position has done since 1988 to
the party's relationship with many female voters, Governor Bush has
spent a year trying to downplay a right-to-life orthodoxy that
cannot be denied. Bush can go for weeks without mentioning
abortion. He usually tries to mask his position with a detour onto
his opposition to partial-birth abortion, a stance that lost its
legitimacy after last month's 5-4 Supreme Court decision
overturning legislative efforts to shatter certain Roe v. Wade
constitutional guarantees. Because it was a one-vote margin,
prochoice voters know that the fundamentals of the right to choose
hang by a thread.
</P>
<P>
   You can now explain it in 30 seconds, says Democratic pollster
Geoffrey Garin, who does research for the Center for Reproductive
Law and Policy, whose president, Janet Benshoof, was the cocounsel
in last month's Nebraska decision. There is now an opportunity to
speak to prochoice Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Between the oral arguments at the Supreme Court and the actual
decision, Garin convened focus groups in two important, swing voter
locales _ Long Island and northern Virginia _ exposing the
discussants to longer newspaper articles summarizing the oral
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Garin's voters, he said, all concluded they had been had by the
right-to-life movement's five-year campaign and concluded to a
person that the Nebraska law was wrong. Until their exposure to
facts, they had to varying degrees bought into the propaganda that
partial-birth abortioninvolved the killingof a babythat was almost
ready to be born.
</P>
<P>
   What was clear from the argument was that all nine justices saw
the Nebraska statute as involving the basic meaning of Roe v. Wade
itself. The voters changed markedly as they discovered that the law
in fact covered more than one procedure that is used before fetuses
are viable, that the political phrase had no medical meaning, that
it made no provision for either a pregnant woman's health or the
presence of a severely deformed fetus. In effect, Garin said they
saw the statute as a sneak attackon Roe and that it awakened their
sense that this was the last arena in which government should be
involved.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a new political opinion. In recent years,
right-to-lifers made three stabs at subverting Roe via state
referendums on partial-birth abortionin the disparate environments
of Maine, Colorado, and Washington state. Each one of them lost
after more thorough debates.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the issue needs more elevated discussion.
Republicans are already nervous about the double-impact of a
prolife veep and approval of another right-to-life platform plank.
</P>
<P>
   The prochoice community needs to respond to the nervousness by
raising the profile of abortion rights, not just in Al Gore's
campaign but in tight Senate races like those in Missouri, New
York, Virginia, Michigan, and even a longer shot like Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The right to choose really does hang by a thread, and George W.
Bush really is committed to ending it.

VERMONT COLLEGE CAUGHT IN SPORTS FUROR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every year, hundreds of students at Champlain College throng to
Memorial Auditorium for the Great Northern Shoot-out. It's a rare
chance to show school spirit. But in two years, the rousing
season-opening basketball tournament will cease to exist.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the Champlain Beavers, long a powerhouse in
junior college sports, won't be around to host the games. Last
month, after students left for the summer, the small
career-oriented college in Burlington, Vt., eliminated all varsity
sports _ one of the few private, four-year colleges ever to take
such a step.
</P>
<P>
   The decision had nothing to do with financial problems, school
officials said. Abolishing varsity sports, they argue, is an
innovative way to free up resources for intramural sports, in
essence slashing top-notch basketball and soccer programs so more
students can take part in everything from kayaking to rock
climbing.
</P>
<P>
   Now, supporters of the varsity teams are reeling, saying that
the end of Beaver sports will hurt school morale and alumni
relations as well. They accuse the administration of disregarding
student support for the teams and defying the recommendation of a
special commission.
</P>
<P>
   And for some of the athletes and coaches, the end of varsity
sports is devastating. Bob Tipson, coach of the men's basketball
team for the last 33 years, who has the eighth best record in
National Junior College Athletic Association history, says the
decision will rip the heart out of the college.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel like you let some people down,'' Tipson lamented,
wondering, ``Was there something else I could have said? Was there
something else I could have done? It's not just the alums, it's the
ones that I haven't coached. The ones who will never get a chance.
It's really just sad.''
</P>
<P>
   In defending the college's decision, which takes effect in the
2002-2003 school year, Champlain president Roger Perry said the
administration spent much of the past year consulting students and
faculty. After surveys and meetings indicated a lackluster interest
in the varsity sports program compared with intramural sports, he
said, the trustees decided it would be better to spend the $500,000
annual varsity budget on a multimillion-dollar facility to increase
students' access to sports, including snowboarding and sailing.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, he said, is to quadruple the number of students on
campus involved in sports, so they're more likely to play than
watch. Now, only about 50 students participate on the three varsity
sports teams _ men's basketball and men's and women's soccer.
Champlain has 1,380 full-time students and 1,105 part-timers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were spending a lot of money for only a few students,''
Perry said. ``This was essentially a business decision. People say
universities don't know how to make priorities and choices. Well,
that's what we're doing. We want more inclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the administration is miscalculating the value
of the varsity sports program. Support from alumni might diminish,
they argue, while school spirit will wane, and nearly $1 million in
tuition money from student athletes will vanish.
</P>
<P>
   Janine Fagan, a 23-year-old center-forward on the women's soccer
team who moved from England to play for Champlain, scoffs at any
suggestion that students aren't interested in varsity sports.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever she goes, she said, people always admire that she plays
for Champlain, which won the NCJAA women's soccer national
championships in 1994 and 1998. The men's basketball team,
meanwhile, has been a top contender for the title five times in the
last decade and the men's soccer team took regional titles in the
1995 and 1997 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's devastating to think that a school with such a high
reputation for its sports program is going to end it all,'' Fagan
said. ``To carry the name on your shirt and your shoulder is very
important. This is like cutting off your nose to spite your face.
And in the long run, I think this could be the downfall of
Champlain.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial questions about the longevity of the varsity sports
program arose in the college's marketing department. Champlain
first began offering four-year bachelor's degrees in 1991. Now,
nearly 90 percent of the students seek such diplomas. The problem,
marketing officials said, is that each time a team wins a
high-profile game, the media mention they're competing against
junior colleges. That, Perry and other school officials say, gives
prospective students the wrong impression.
</P>
<P>
   The image problem sparked interest across the campus in the
Beavers joining a four-year athletic association, such as the
National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics. Perry and
trustees said it was simply too expensive for the college, which
has an operating budget of about $25 million, to maintain the
varsity program and launch a serious intramural program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is a series of tradeoffs,'' he said. ``Dollars have to
follow priorities. It's like a family budget. I would love a boat,
an airplane, and a Lexus. But we can't have it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Collins, chairman of the college's board of trustees,
insisted the decision serves the college's best interests. ``The
college and the student body has changed,'' he said. ``The best
information we have shows this is what students want. And one of
the reasons Champlain is healthy is because it makes difficult,
soul-searching decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics from students to professors argue the administration
misread student surveys in deciding they didn't care about varsity
sports. For example, a Champlain survey cites 43.5 percent of
students saying the varsity sports program doesn't interest them at
all. But that means 56.5 percent of the students are interested,
the critics note.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was always a lot of school spirit here, and a lot of
people rallied around the teams,'' said Elizabeth Hartwick, a
21-year-old senior who signed a petition with hundreds of other
students in favor of keeping the varsity teams. ``Our name was
athletics. That's what we were. Now it's gone, and I'm wondering
what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   So is David Mona, an assistant professor of accounting who has
taught at Champlain for 15 years. Like others at Champlain, he
doesn't understand how the trustees made the leap from considering
moving the teams to another league to eliminating them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The natural decision would have been to take the sports teams
out of a junior league and put (them) in a four-year sports
league,'' he said. ``That would be the capstone for the transition.
But I just can't understand this. We're financially healthy enough
to do both. Is this for the sake of being unique?''
</P>
<P>
   Now, after years of coaching at Champlain, both Tipson and Sue
Rand, the college's athletic director and women's soccer coach, are
mulling a future neither ever expected.
</P>
<P>
   Tipson, who has been at Champlain since studying there as an
undergraduate, and Rand, who has worked in the athletic department
for 18 years and has turned down several job offers, are both
dusting off their resumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had planned to spend the rest of my career here,'' Rand
said. ``But that's minor in the greater scheme. We have a history
and legacy of successful athletic programs. They're a large part of
the overall college experience. The students are going to miss
that.''

 &HT;    Beware: Snoop software can record your every keystroke
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Most of us live lives of quiet boredom. We don't steal
atomic secrets, plan hostile mergers, or plot to overthrow the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Worst case, you may say something mean-spirited in an e-mail,
brag about cheating the IRS out of a few bucks, or make a joke that
you wouldn't repeat to an assemblage of scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I don't know anyone who wants to make his life an open
book. Few of us would invite someone to sit down and read
everything in our computer, to browse all the e-mails stored there,
even to be able to read notes that were started and erased without
ever being saved.
</P>
<P>
   The computer has become _ over the years _ the most private of
personal secretaries. Until recently the information you stored
there was at least as safe from gossip as if you entrusted it to a
human secretary.
</P>
<P>
   There were ways _ of various sophistication _ of snooping. Even
years ago, there were programs _ distributed quietly on bulletin
boards and Web pages run by hackers _ called keyboard logging
programs. They hid in the shadows of your hard disk and were almost
impossible to detect by the user. They logged every keystroke on
that particular machine. Then, the hacker could sit down at the
machine at his leisure, enter a password and read a transcript that
showed every keystroke made.
</P>
<P>
   While that isn't exactly a great thing, the chances of being
snared by one of those programs were slim. Most ordinary people
didn't even know such programs existed, and some amount of computer
skill was required to locate and install the programs. There just
wasn't a big risk that you'd bump into something like that.
</P>
<P>
   But, within the past few months, the chances of someone _ a
spouse, a friend, a co-worker _ taking a private look at every word
you've written have jumped way up. That same type of spying
software is now available down at your favorite computer store.
There are now commercial programs _ selling in the $50 range _ that
are as easy to use as a word processor. Simply load one into a
computer and _ just like the old hacker programs _ you can read
every typed secret at a glance.
</P>
<P>
   Several of these programs exist including Spector, 007 Stealth
Activity Recorder, Cyber Snoop and eBlaster (we'll talk more about
this one later). The basic idea is that the program hides in the
computer and serves as a high tech peeping Tom.
</P>
<P>
   Parents are supposed to be able to make sure that kids aren't
hanging out on the wrong electronic blocks in cyberspace. Spouses
theoretically can use it to make sure a partner isn't engaged in
extracurricular sex _ either the real thing or the cyber version.
Even that rubs me wrong, but there would be those who disagree, so
I'll leave the question for those smarter than myself.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to be a genius to figure that some people are
going to use these programs in really twisted ways. Kids will snoop
on parents, boyfriends on girlfriends, and _ probably most likely _
a lot of folks will snoop just for the fun of it, turning your life
into a real-life soap opera.
</P>
<P>
   And, as if programs like Spector aren't frightening enough,
software such as eBlaster takes snooping to a higher level. That
program can be set up to send the details of what you type on your
computer by e-mail. Which means that the person who wants to spy on
your computer only needs access to it one time. After installing
the program, he can harvest the details of your life from the
safety of his home computer. And no trail of the e-mails remains on
the host computer.
</P>
<P>
   Finding these programs is easy at the store but difficult once
they're installed on the computer. After all, that's the whole
idea. They're made to hide and reside in hidden directories that
won't show up in a routine search. And since the person who
installs them can set the hidden command needed to view the log
files, you're unlikely to ever notice the program once it is
installed. Since the hidden logs files take up 50 megabytes or more
on the hard disk, one way to detect them would be to check hard
disk space. But in these days of 20 gigabyte hard drives, even that
isn't very practical.
</P>
<P>
   So the real secret _ when it comes to avoiding the risk that
someone might plant one of these sinister programs on your PC _ is
to know who your friends are. Which isn't such a bad thing, no
matter what your secrets are.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ That there were men in chic white suits wearing Gucci
flip-flops and pink-lensed sunglasses in the audience at a fashion
show was not surprising. But this fall collection, on display at
the Chelsea Piers last week, belonged to Target, the
Minneapolis-based department store with a reputation for selling
all things middle America, from outdoor grills to boxer shorts.
</P>
<P>
   So the relative hipness of the event was all the more
remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old retailer, with a superstore in every major
American city except New York, is conducting a major Northeast
expansion spree. At the same time, the company has launched a campy
branding campaign, using lighthearted '60s music and a
red-and-white bull's-eye logo designed to lure a new spectrum of
buyers to its huge stores.
</P>
<P>
   John Remington, the company's vice president for special events,
opened this show by declaring that the retailer is ``on a mission
to democratize fashion'' by making clothing designers and trends
accessible and affordable.
</P>
<P>
   While Target has succeeded in winning over fans for its home
furnishings from such designers as Starck and Michael Graves _ both
of whom are new to the store, with Stark poised to roll out a full
line next year _ its fashion offerings have had less impact.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what the Chelsea show was all about: Creating a buzz,
encouraging fashionistas _ some of whom cheekily call the store
Tar-ZHAY _ to appreciate the store's clothing in a more glamorous
light, and showcasing the company's self-effacing approach and
quirky marketing linking household commodities to clothing. To wit:
one model wore pants covered with the Ziploc baggie logo. Target
sells the Ziplocs, not the pants, which drew the loudest applause
of the 10-minute show.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we try to do is include models who are kind of like our
guests. Some are older. Some are younger,'' said Target spokeswoman
Carolyn Brookter. ``This year, even as we look at our fashion, it
runs the gamut from New Age western to luxury, with leather. And
then there's the woman who's on the go: travel fashion. That tends
sometimes to be an older'' market.
</P>
<P>
   A blondish-gray-haired female model just past middle age also
got some clapping for standing out as an unusual specimen amid her
lithe colleagues as she strode out in a khaki skirt and vest, cut
just the right way so as not to be frumpy. But pausing before a
relatively small bank of photographers, the younger models who
circled the oversized bull's-eye-shaped stage seemed almost
embarrassed to be there.
</P>
<P>
   The only color in the room came from the clothes and those
red-and-white concentric circles in the center of the floor.
Everything else in the cavernous showroom was black: the walls, the
ceiling, and the folding chairs for 600.
</P>
<P>
   The show's first round consisted of black and gray nylon pants
and vests boasting an urban/high-tech feel, with lots of pockets,
which were paired with clingy ribbed turtleneck and zip-front
sweaters. A pale blue scarf of stuffed nylon drew murmurs from the
appreciative crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The next grouping featured a hippie theme, with tie-dye shirts,
knit hats, and knee-length rayon print skirts. In the midst of the
parade came the unexpected _ a skirt with an all-over Meow Mix logo
and a matching kerchief on the model's head. The skirt and scarf
were made just for the show, with a wink to fall's emphasis on
animal prints and to Target's pet department.
</P>
<P>
   A sharp-jawed male model looked slick in his black flat-front
pants and silky T-shirt, which sported an all-over print of Mr.
Clean's face; household supplies, you see, are another selling
point for the store.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the Western motif: denim cropped jeans and
skirts, chambray jackets, cowboy hats, and suede bags with fringe,
as well as animal-print accessories and snake skin-style pants.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, the crowd applauded, then bolted for the exits
in a mad dash to secure cabs. In the crush, one man said in a stage
whisper to a friend, ``There was some interesting stuff. But
nothing I'd buy myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the show ended abruptly, the buildup began two hours
earlier with a themed cocktail party just outside the event room.
</P>
<P>
   Waiters dressed in white shirts, black pants, and aprons covered
in the Meow Mix, Cheer, and Puffs logos, as they collected party
detritus on silver platters and doled out delicacies on sleek black
servers. The floral arrangements contained white ``flowers'' made
of tissue (Puffs, to be exact).
</P>
<P>
   The crowd, meanwhile, was reading the fine print on a Pop-art
installation billed as Warhol-esque. In one instance, instead of
using tomato soup cans, an artist assembled boxes of dry cat food
(yes, Meow Mix) to create a ``cat space mobile.''
</P>
<P>
   Large, target-shaped cushions were strewn here and there in the
room so the weary could rest their stiletto-pained feet. Outside,
on the deck overlooking the East River, sat a Jolly Rancher-shaped
cushion, wrapped in plastic just like the hard candies sold at the
store. Tie-in: the Western-inspired denim clothing and cowboy hats.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the red-haired woman whose accessories included a
pet Pomeranian and a Louis Vuitton bag. She _ and her dog _ mingled
over cocktails. But both actually stayed to see the fashions, as
did Sasha Charnin Morrison, fashion market director at Allure
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that each category was pretty strong,'' Morrison
said of the clothes. ``I think it's stuff that you want.''

   STEVENSVILLE, Mont. _ Up on Sunset Bench, between the sparse,
rounded humps of the Sapphire Mountains and the jagged glower of
the Bitterroot Mountains, four weathered men stand around the
dropped tailgate of a pickup truck with the grim demeanor of old
generals facing the relentless advance of an ancient foe.
</P>
<P>
   From their meadowed vantage point, they study a map draped
across the tailgate. They trace the likely routes of invasion _
down the steep drainages leading from the rocky fastness of the
Bitterroots into the narrow valley with the same name, natural
corridors of assault between the rugged wilderness and the towns,
ranches and roads of the lowlands these men call home.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kitchen, this is where the food is,'' said Dick
Everett, stabbing a finger to the mapped contours of the valley.
``You put your biggest predator up there in those mountains and he
can't find food, he'll move on down. The only place that's low,
with plenty of food, is right here.''
</P>
<P>
   Their enemy is the grizzly bear, hounded from the Bitterroots
since the 1840s and not seen in these parts since the 1940s,
although some biologists believe a few may lurk deep within these
5,785 square miles of high, wild country along the Idaho-Montana
border.
</P>
<P>
   If wildlife advocates and federal biologists have their way, Ol'
Silvertip will soon start a slow march through the Bitterroots
again, jump-started by a proposed government program to inject
captured bears back into this former home range. That prospect puts
these men on the battlements of yet another campaign in the ongoing
Western war over endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fight classically portrayed as a bipolar affair between
the New West and the Old, between urban and rural, between those
who regard this region as America's awe-inspiring playground and
those _ like Everett, who runs about 300 head of sheep along the
east side of Sunset Bench _ who live and work amid the majestic
scenery.
</P>
<P>
   But a quarter-century-long struggle over threatened animals has
balkanized the issue's politics, resulting in firefights between
presumed allies, pervasive unwillingness to abandon the
well-sandbagged position for common ground, and pressure on the
Endangered Species Act itself.
</P>
<P>
   Renewal of the Endangered Species Act is bottled up in Congress
by Western Republicans taking aim at the law's command-and-control
nature _ particularly the notion of federal land managers imposing
their will without any meaningful local input _ and the fairly
inflexible land use restrictions that protect a listed animal's
habitat. They lack the majority to impose their will on other
politicians just as adamant about wildlife preservation.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bitterroots, meanwhile, internecine conflict may well
overwhelm a promising feature of the grizzly plan: putting a
citizen management committee in charge of the bear's
reintroduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I can't say we've got anything like tranquillity,'' said
Tom France, director of the Northern Rockies Project Office of the
National Wildlife Federation. ``On the left, there are
environmentalists who aren't happy with compromise and on the
right, there are people who don't want grizzlies, fear them and
don't like Fish and Wildlife.''
</P>
<P>
   He referred to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, a sponsor of
the grizzly plan.
</P>
<P>
   The grizzly is officially listed as a threatened species in
every state but Alaska, thriving in only two Lower 48 locations _
Glacier and Yellowstone national parks. In the next few weeks,
though, federal wildlife officials expect to give final approval to
release of an ``experimental/non-essential population'' of bears
captured in Canada or from Yellowstone and Glacier. In time _
perhaps a century, given the grizzly's slow reproductive cycle _
advocates hope to see around 300 of the solitary predators roaming
the Bitterroots.
</P>
<P>
   The first grizzlies _ ``charismatic megafauna,'' a scientific
designation for toothy predators like bears, mountain lions and
wolves _ have yet to be darted, drugged and netted. But the
rhetoric is already thundering.
</P>
<P>
   ``You stumble upon a mama grizzly and her cubs and tell me just
how charismatic SHE is,'' grumbled Idaho Gov. Dirk Kempthorne, a
Republican and former U.S. senator who has threatened to sue the
Fish and Wildlife Service over the grizzly proposal. ``The idea
we're supposed to be an outdoor laboratory for these large
predators may be popular back East, but we don't want them. ...
We'll ship a few of these flesh-eating carnivores to their back
yards and see how THEY like dealing with this dangerous animal.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who've tried to stake out the middle ground find
themselves in a political no-man's land. France and the regional
leader of another national wildlife organization sat down with
loggers, union paper mill workers and timber companies to work out
the citizen management committee, only to be hammered from all
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the radical center and everybody wants a piece of you _
your friends and your enemies,'' said Hank Fischer, director of the
Northern Rockies office of the Defenders of Wildlife and a key
negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   Including members appointed by the governors of Idaho and
Montana and the Nez Perce Indian tribe, the 15-person committee
would mark the first time that a portion of official power in the
endangered species process has been given to someone other than a
federal biologist or bureaucrat, advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   The committee could be a model for future projects. It could
address Westerners' prime complaint about the Endangered Species
Act _ that there is no local input or power. And France believes it
could help build broader support for endangered species
restoration.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just too many stakeholders out here to say the
environmental community alone can sustain these critters through
the generations,'' France said. ``We need to build a larger
community because if we don't want 'em around, they won't be here.
We'll kill 'em off.''
</P>
<P>
   Timbermen started meeting with preservationists in 1994, holding
some initially tense meetings at a lodge near Lolo Pass. Both sides
were motivated by pragmatic self-interest _ the greens wanted to
get animals on the ground with minimal delay and maximum management
flexibility; the loggers and timber companies figured the bear
program was a done deal and hoped to carve out a place at the table
where their interests could be heard.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, they won over their brethren, pointing to the
devastating impact of spotted owl preservation on the timber
industry in Oregon and Washington, warning that last-ditch
opposition on the grizzly could land them in the same place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you, the president of my association is not for
this and wonders whether he'd be better off shooting me,'' said
Mike Quigley, a member of the Associated Logging Contractors.
``Loggers aren't happy about this, but they realize that if there's
a problem with a grizzly bear, it's a lot better to be able to call
somebody like me than to call the federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   But even though local control is their battle cry, the prospect
of a citizen management committee doesn't mollify conservative
critics of the grizzly program. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt
still has final say over the committee's actions, they point out,
and there is nothing to keep federal bureaucrats from scrapping the
committee once the program is under way.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   These parliamentary points are dwarfed by the specter of the
grizzly itself.
</P>
<P>
   With its massive power and savage reputation, the bear has
struck terror since the days of Lewis and Clark, who traversed the
Bitterroots during their epic explorations nearly two centuries
ago. Since 1980, grizzlies have killed nine people and seriously
injured another 57, most of them hikers in Glacier or Yellowstone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It scares me to death that they're bringing in the grizzly and
that it might kill somebody's child,'' said Everett. ``How are they
going to compensate the parents for that?''
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife biologists downplay the grizzly's deadly potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're at more risk from getting hit by a drunk driver on your
way to the trailhead than you are getting killed by a grizzly,''
said Chris Servheen, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service coordinator for
the grizzly bear reintroduction program.
</P>
<P>
   Servheen thinks the grizzly, like the wolf before it, has become
a repository for the cultural fears of tradition-minded Westerners.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the fear associated with this is not about the bear
itself _ it's about changes in the West, changes in a lifestyle
that has lived for centuries,'' he said. ``It's the impact this
will have on the historic way people have related to nature in the
West. People are afraid they won't be able to hunt and ranch and do
things the way they've always done things out here.''
</P>
<P>
   The timbermen are sticking to their deal _ though not without
trepidation. Since selling the citizen management proposal to their
members, they've watched other federal land use mandates severely
curb their ability to harvest timber on public land.
</P>
<P>
   These include reintroduction of the endangered lynx and the
hottest and most controversial issue, President Clinton's
``roadless initiative,'' which would eliminate old logging roads
and rope off millions of acres of national forest from new road
construction. Additional logging restrictions protect water quality
for endangered fish _ the various species of Pacific salmon and the
bull trout.
</P>
<P>
   ``So why are we still here?'' asked Bill Mulligan, president of
Three Rivers Timber Co., a small logging mill in Kamiah, Idaho, on
the west side of the Bitterroots. ``Well, we gave our word.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, environmentalists with whom the timbermen broke bread
are being pilloried by purists who say the grizzly plan sacrifices
science and strict habitat preservation to getting the animals
quickly in place and eventually proving that they can be taken off
the endangered list.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration seems particularly sensitive to this
last point, anxious to demonstrate that animals aren't listed just
to blast people from the land and lock up precious vistas for
backpackers. Clinton was quick to trumpet the delisting of the bald
eagle; Babbitt and his subordinates pushed mightily to downgrade
the status of the gray wolf in the western Great Lakes region. In
fact, in mid-July, federal regulators announced that efforts to
save the wolf had been successful enough to reduce protections for
that animal throughout much of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The same imperative _ the politics of the Endangered Species Act
_ seems to be driving the grizzly project, said Mike Bader,
executive director of the Alliance for the Wild Rockies, a
grass-roots environmental group based in Missoula, Mont.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been an overemphasis on getting the bears on the
ground and declaring victory,'' he said. ``The big concern is that
the political bottom line determined the product, rather than what
the bears really need biologically.''
</P>
<P>
   There is particular anger over use of the
``experimental/non-essential population'' designation _ first for
wolves, now for the grizzly. This special provision of the
Endangered Species Act was patched onto the law in 1982 to give
wildlife managers greater flexibility in dealing with problem
animals.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, it's easier to kill, relocate or otherwise manage a
rogue wolf or bear with an ``experimental'' designation because
that animal doesn't carry the full and automatic protections of the
act. And because this status doesn't entirely restrict land use,
wildlife managers can tailor their program to allow some ranching,
logging, hunting and other activities where the animal is
reintroduced.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   But purists say this approach fails to protect crucial swaths of
habitat essential to an animal's ultimate survival. Without the
Endangered Species Act's complete restrictions, they argue, humans
won't curtail or end activities to accommodate an animal's need for
food, shelter and reproductive opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular concern are the so-called ``corridors'' of
habitat, routes of travel between concentrations of animals that
ensure the genetic mingling that maintains a species' reproductive
health.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to bite the bullet, damn it,'' said Chuck Jonkel, a
longtime bear biologist and president of the Great Bear Foundation,
a nonprofit group based in Missoula.
</P>
<P>
   Bucking the prevailing scientific wisdom, Jonkel and other
maverick biologists believe grizzlies are already living deep
within the Selway-Bitterroot wilderness area, undetected by man,
and they're searching for proof.
</P>
<P>
   Any bears they find would be fully protected, their habitat
subject to the full force of the Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   Up on Sunset Bench, the men study their map.
</P>
<P>
   They point to the red ribbon of road that runs through the heart
of their valley _ U.S. Highway 93. It is the eastern boundary of
the grizzly bear recovery zone, the front line of this latest war.
</P>
<P>
   They vow they won't be driven from their land _ not by grizzly
nor man.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has got to be one of the prettiest places in the world
and it's a privilege to live here,'' said Jim Freeman, a retired
federal forester. ``I guess that's why we fight so hard to stay
here.''

IN JERUSALEM, ENMITIES YIELDING TO A FRAGILE HOPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The spirit of reconciliation seems buried under the
weight of the Old City's ancient stones, which retain the scorching
summer heat here as the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim faithful
throng to their holy sites.
</P>
<P>
   But in the cool, antiseptic environs of the maternity ward at
Haddasah Hospital on Mount Scopus, the cries of newborns seemed to
awaken hope Monday that a solution can be found on the future of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In a city sharply divided by culture, politics, and religion,
and which both Palestinians and Israelis insist on as their
capital, the Hadassah maternity ward is one of few places where the
two sides seem intimately bound together, in this case by the joy
of birth. And to those here Monday the possibility that the
negotiators at Camp David could make a breakthrough on Jerusalem
did seem possible, even necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should be locked in a room and kept there until there is
an agreement, because what we have here is not a life,'' said Gary
Hughes, 40, an immigrant to Israel from England.
</P>
<P>
   He looked exhausted after helping his wife, Margolit, deliver
their daughter, Maya, who he boasted was ``our first ``sabra,'' the
Hebrew word for the tough little cactus that is used to describe
Jewish children born in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be an agreement, or there is no future for any
of these babies, whether they're Israeli or Palestinian,'' he said,
as Israeli and Palestinian women in pink bathrobes wheeled newborns
to and from the nursery.
</P>
<P>
   Hanadi Mustafa, 25, a Palestinian woman from the nearby village
of Isawiya, was cradling her new baby girl, who did not yet have a
name: ``There is a way for the leaders to agree, God willing. There
are extremists on both sides, but most people just want a better
future.''
</P>
<P>
   In the next two days, perhaps even before these mothers and
their newborns go home, the fate of Jerusalem could be determined.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp David, the Palestinian and Israeli leaders were said to
be working hard Monday on a series of proposals that could resolve
the rival claims to Jerusalem. The Israelis reportedly summoned
Reuven Merhav, a specialist on Jerusalem issues, from Israel. He
was expected to help map out a proposal to grant Palestinians rule
of East Jerusalem in exchange for grafting surrounding West Bank
settlements onto West Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   West Jerusalem is today predominantly Jewish. East Jerusalem and
the Old City, which were captured by Israel from Jordan in 1967,
are mainly Palestinian.
</P>
<P>
   In practical terms, the two sides live in deeply divided
communities. West Jerusalem is a modern city of secular and
religious Israelis who live amid shopping malls, clean boulevards,
parks with green grass, McDonald's restaurants, Blockbuster Video
stores, and Tower Records.
</P>
<P>
   East Jerusalem is a different story. Israeli police and army
units patrol intensively. But residents say municipal services in
Palestinian areas are badly neglected, while the Israeli government
pumps millions of dollars into expanding and improving Jewish
settlements around Palestinian neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the Palestinian areas of East Jerusalem are
already under the de facto control of Yasser Arafat's Palestinian
Authority. Palestinian plainclothes police work the streets and the
school curriculum is set by Palestinian educators. Palestinians
vote for their parliament and have their own representatives in the
Palestinian Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Seidemann, a Jerusalem lawyer and longtime peace
activist, said that at the Camp David negotiations, ``the point is
not to create something new, but to tell the truth about something
that already exists.''
</P>
<P>
   But Israel has long maintained that Jerusalem is its ``eternal
and indivisible'' capital, and the more hardline opposition, made
up largely of religious Jewish parties, is pressuring Prime
Minister Barak not to allow a divided city.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians claim that East Jerusalem was taken from them
during the 1967 war and, according to UN resolutions, must be
returned. They say East Jerusalem and the Old City are the rightful
place for the capital of an independent state that Arafat has vowed
to declare this fall, with or without an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   And so the two leaders at the Camp David summit, hosted by
President Clinton, are struggling to find a way to share control of
a city coveted through the ages.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem could make or break a peace deal at Camp David. An
agreement on Jerusalem could end 52 years of Arab-Israeli conflict
and open the way for other tough issues to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to agree on Jerusalem could undermine diligent efforts
on other fronts, and possibly reignite violence. Other issues
include the final borders between Israel and those parts of the
West Bank that will fall under Palestinian rule, as well as the
fate of 3 million Palestinian refugees uprooted by wars in 1948 and
1967.
</P>
<P>
   To understand just how powerfully emotional is the battle for
Jerusalem, enter Damascus Gate and walk the cobblestones of El Wad
Street in the Old City, with its Ottoman-era walls and its ancient
warren of streets and alleys.
</P>
<P>
   The narrow, winding street is a melange of smells of spice and
Turkish coffee and a mix of sounds of the Muslim call to prayer, of
church bells, of the crackling of Israeli soldiers' radios, and
blaring Arab pop music.
</P>
<P>
   El Wad skirts the ``Via Dolorosa'' where Jesus is believed to
have carried the cross, then winds its way to the entrance to the
plaza of the Western Wall, the holiest site in Judaism and all that
remains of the Second Temple destroyed by Romans in the year 70
A.D. It also leads to the passage that brings Muslims to the Dome
of the Rock, where tradition holds that the prophet Mohammed
ascended to heaven. Muslims call the raised 35-acre space where the
golden dome shimmers by the name al-Haram al Sharif. Jews call it
the Temple Mount, and under it are the remains of the destroyed
temples.
</P>
<P>
   Chaim Yishai, 24, a Jewish settler with a knitted kippah on his
head and a pistol strapped to his waist, rushed for prayers at the
Western Wall Monday, saying, ``Just open the Bible and read, this
city was always Jewish. For 2,000 years we dreamed of returning,
and we prayed. Why should we give an inch, and why should we give
up the dream of rebuilding the Temple?''
</P>
<P>
   Along the same path, Hassan Abu Zneid, 40, was heading to his
job as a guard at the Dome of the Rock. ``If the Jews ever try to
lay a finger on our mosque, there will be war,'' he warned. ``This
is a place for all three religions, but East Jerusalem and the Old
City are Palestinian. It must be under Palestinian rule or there
will be violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Minister of Justice Yossi Beilen, an architect of the
1993 Israeli-Palestinian accord at Oslo, said a solution on the
future of Jerusalem, which may be the most intractable problem the
two sides face, could open the door to solving all other issues.
</P>
<P>
   That, analysts here suggest, is why Clinton has pushed Barak and
Arafat to begin the negotiations with the Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we solve Jerusalem, we can show we can solve the other
problems,'' said Beilen in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem's mayor, Ehud Olmert, a member of the conservative
opposition Likud Party, vehemently disagrees, and he joined some
150,000 demonstrators in Tel Aviv to make their point clear to
Barak, who faces a domestic political crisis upon his return, with
or without an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerusalem is the heart of Jewish existence,'' said Olmert.
``It is not a heart to Muslims or to Christians.''
</P>
<P>
   Illustrating with maps of Jewish and Palestinian populations in
the east and west sides of the city as he spoke in his office,
Olmert dismissed proposals for shared rule of Jerusalem as ``not a
solution, but a prescription for almost endless conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a half-mile down the road, across what was the ``no man's
land'' separating the two sides of Jerusalem between the wars of
1948 and 1967, is Orient House in East Jerusalem, which has become
the focal point for the Palestinian leadership and administration.
Faisal Husseini, the Palestinian official responsible for Jerusalem
affairs, held a town meeting last week, where Muslim and Christian
clerics and community leaders gathered to express the intense
feeling in the streets that there can be no peace without
Palestinian control of East Jerusalem as it existed before the 1967
war.
</P>
<P>
   That is ``clearly what is called for in Resolution 242,'' said
Husseini, referring to the UN Security council's action. The
Israeli-Palestinian ``Declaration of Principles'' signed on the
White House lawn on Sept. 13, 1993, he went on, says that ``the
negotiations on permanent status will lead to the implementation of
Security Council Resolution 242,'' approved in 1967 and ordered the
withdrawal of Israeli troops from occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the emotion on both sides, the Israeli-funded Hadassah
Hospital that is among the more advanced medical care facilities in
the world, stands as a practical, modern reality, perhaps even a
model of coexistence in which it seems possible to see Palestinians
and Israelis learning to live together.
</P>
<P>
   The staff is mostly Israeli, but there are Palestinian doctors
and nurses as well. The patients are a mix, people struggling with
illness and rejoicing in birth in side-by-side beds.
</P>
<P>
   George Moshe, 60, an Iranian-born Jew who works as a security
guard in the Israeli parliament and became a grandfather Monday,
spoke there with the wisdom of age: ``When my daughter was born, we
hoped she would never go to the army. Now she has a baby, and we
find ourselves hoping again. Every generation wants it to be better
for the next, and we hope our leaders know that.''

`SURVIVOR' THEORY ON NET UNDERSCORES POP PHENOMENON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They're talking about it at water coolers, debating it on
bulletin boards. They're searching for the answer everywhere _
hacking Web sites, scouring computer code, analyzing television
footage. Everyone wants to be the first to know who will emerge
victorious at the end of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   No, we're not talking about the bid for vice president _ Did
someone say election? We're talking about ``Survivor,'' the CBS
reality program (Wednesday at 8 p.m.) that critics originally
dismissed as the end of Western civilization but that is actually
bringing people together to share a common pop cultural obsession.
Who will survive the rats _ both literal and figurative?
</P>
<P>
   There hasn't been this much popular attention to a TV
cliffhanger since the nation wondered who shot J.R. on ``Dallas''
in 1980 or who killed Laura Palmer on ``Twin Peaks'' in 1990. There
is, of course, nothing new about conspiracy theories and pop
culture. But today, there is one difference to the rampant
speculation about ``Survivor'': It's called the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone stood around the water cooler and speculated about
who shot J.R., and it was intense,'' recalls cultural critic Steven
Stark. ``But with the Internet, the water cooler is a heck of a lot
bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   And today, conspiracy theories run deeper, spread more quickly,
and involve more high-tech espionage. Over the weekend, a Canadian
college student claimed to have discovered the winner of the show
by cracking into files supposedly not available to the public on
the CBS ``Survivor'' Web site (see end of story for details). The
student, Corrie Sloot of Ontario, found image files of the 16
contestants; all of the photos were marked with a red X, except
one. He immediately announced his shocking revelation on the
popular fan site, www.survivorsucks.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in North America always open their Christmas presents
before Christmas,'' Sloot said in an interview by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the show has given CBS a nice little Christmas in
July; last week, almost 25 million people watched the top-ranked
show.
</P>
<P>
   Sloot's announcement set off a wave of further speculation that
the discovery was a red herring planted by CBS. Earlier in the
show's run, one of the contestants who had already been kicked off
the show dropped a hint that the winner was Gretchen Cody, a former
Air Force survival instructor. That theory was nixed last week,
when Cody was voted off the show.
</P>
<P>
   Is the Sloot's discovery just another false clue?
</P>
<P>
   ``CBS will neither confirm nor deny any report about the future
results of `Survivor' and instead will continue letting the press
run inaccurate information,'' said Dana McClintock, vice president
of communications.
</P>
<P>
   Is this a brilliant marketing coup or a dumb mistake by some
unwitting Web designer? CBS isn't talking.
</P>
<P>
   But Paul Sims, the Dallas-based programmer who runs
survivorsucks.com, says he doubts CBS is planting false leads.
``It's like this monster that keeps growing based on a kernel of
truth,'' says Sims, whose site received 250,000 hits last week. (In
an ironic note, Monday Sims was asked to shut down another fan site
for another CBS reality show, ``Big Brother,'' by its producers,
despite the fact that his ``Survivor'' site is feeding a media
frenzy.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, computer security experts say such a mistake breaks
the basic rule of Web design. ``It's common knowledge that you
never put anything out on the Web that you don't need to have out
there, especially with something top secret,'' says Weld Pond, a
research scientist at the Cambridge-based computer security firm,
At Stake.
</P>
<P>
   Some enterprising students at MIT weren't convinced that Sloot's
X theory was legit, so they did some sleuthing and discovered
another series of photographs of all 16 contestants on another
section of the Web site; all 16 were shown with a red X. The kids
at MIT didn't really care about the show until the rumors emerged
about the Web site: ``That kind of thing excites people on this
campus,'' said Satwik Seshasai, chairman of MIT's student newspaper
and one of the students who sought to disprove the rumor.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, you can't buy the kind of publicity ``Survivor'' is
generating. ``If you had 15 minutes to spend, would you prefer
listening to the drab packaged rhetoric of both Gore (and) Bush or
getting a chance to see who's going to win (a million) bucks?''
asks Democratic political consultant Michael Goldman, who expresses
disdain for ``Survivor'' but admits he will probably watch the
final show. ``What do you get with Bush and Gore? It's just blah,
you know?'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In the '70s, we had the Watergate trials, in the '80s we had
``Dallas,'' and now we have a desert isle. And there are some who
say that this particular pop cultural phenomenon isn't necessarily
a bad thing since it brings together a fragmented, divided nation.
``Television used to be a social glue, and that has changed in the
late 20th century,'' says Robert Thompson, professor of film and
television at Syracuse University. ``This show, and `Who Wants to
Be a Millionaire,' remind me of the '50s, because everyone can sit
around and watch it, young, old, rich, and poor.''
</P>
<P>
   And the show itself, Thompson points out, is quite clean-cut,
despite its initial promise of all the fun that comes with scantily
clad strangers marooned in the tropics. But that innocence could
change: After the show debuted in Sweden, some particants contended
that other contestants smuggled alcohol and tobacco onto the
island, allegedly with the help of the producers. And some fans of
the show think CBS is sure to cook up something fishy in upcoming
episodes. Could it be that there is yet another conspiracy brewing?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SPOILER: Read no further if you don't want to know Sloot's
theory of the alleged winner, however dubious. He suggests that the
victor is Gervase Peterson, a youth basketball coach
distinguishable as the only contestant on the island who can't
swim.

HOW CANCER SPURRED A BIKING STAR'S BIG WIN

IT'S NOT ABOUT THE BIKE 
My Journey Back to Life 
By Lance Armstrong with Sally Jenkins 
Putname, 288 pp., $24.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bicycle is a grand metaphor for life. It is freedom but also
control. It is a parent who has held a child in arm's-length safety
for a young lifetime letting go _ go! _ and pushing the precious
human cargo free, without benefit of training wheels. The young
rider is under her own power, wobbling at first, now steady, the
tears gone, the smile triumphant. It is all there, the bond between
parent and child spinning into trust on a warm summer's day.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Armstrong, the Texan who this week is trying to repeat
last year's victory in the Tour de France, rides this metaphor for
all it is worth in his remarkable autobiography. His life has been
a ride over countless mountain ranges, figurative and literal.
Winning the Tour de France, with its many 100-mile-plus days and
alpine passages, was the easy part, to hear Armstrong tell it.
</P>
<P>
   As the title of Armstrong's book says, ``It's Not About the
Bike.'' Armstrong, as even many casual sports fans know by now, was
a brash up-and-coming US star of the European racing circuit when
he discovered in 1996 that he had testicular cancer. For months, he
ignored the pain, thinking it was the price of pounding in the
saddle. Then the pain transformed itself into terror; a testicle
grew three times its normal size and he began coughing up blood.
Finally, he went to his doctor. Armstrong's failure to deal earlier
with the symptoms of this rare form of cancer enabled the disease
to speed through his body and affect his brain, ultimately
requiring a horrific combination of brain surgery and chemotherapy.
By the end of his treatment, Armstrong was so weak he couldn't ride
his bike for months. Any thought that he could participate in a
bike race _ or even a neighborhood jaunt _ seemed far-fetched.
</P>
<P>
   As Armstrong knows well, relatively few Americans would be
interested in his story if it were merely a tale of how he won the
Tour de France. It has been nearly a century since bicycle racing
was the most popular sport in the United States. While the
three-week race through France is one of the world's most-watched
sporting spectacles, there is nothing remotely comparable to it in
this country, and most mainstream media here give bicycle racing
short shrift. It has taken a human story of tragedy and triumph to
give the sport the attention it deserves in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong and his skilled co-author, sports journalist Sally
Jenkins, put this elegantly in perspective. ``I left my house on
October 2, 1996, as one person and came home another,'' Armstrong
writes.
</P>
<P>
   That was cancer day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that cancer was the best thing that ever happened
to me,'' Armstrong writes. ``I don't know why I got the illness,
but it did wonders for me, and I wouldn't want to walk away from
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was just a scrawny 7-year-old when he got his first
``serious'' bike, an ugly brown Schwinn Mag Scrambler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why does a kid love a bike?'' Armstrong writes. ``It's
liberation and independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Independence turned out to be a valuable commodity. Armstrong
never met his biological father, whom he refers to acidly as the
``DNA donor'' and ``my so-called father.'' He is similarly
disparaging about the man who adopted him and married and divorced
his mother. He says his own name, Armstrong, means nothing to him.
A hero of the book is Lance's mother, who was 17 years old when
Lance was born and raised him mostly as a single mother.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's story of his treatment and recovery in Indianapolis
is the heart of the book. Doctors and nurses are heroes. His former
French racing team, which tried to renegotiate Armstrong's contract
after learning of his cancer, is the villain. Shortly after being
declared cancer-free, Lance got married; his wife, Kristin,
eventually went through a painful but successful process of
in-vitro fertilization to have a child.
</P>
<P>
   In unexpected ways, the cancer treatment helped Armstrong win
the Tour de France as a rider for the team sponsored by the US
Postal Service. The treatment led to a dramatic weight loss and
reshaped Armstrong's muscular structure, making it easier for him
to climb the highest mountains. He was forced to make his technique
more efficient, pedaling in an easier gear at a higher speed. By
the time Armstrong recovered from his cancer treatment, he was like
the kid on a new bike again, craving the freedom. That is the
inspiration of this book, to feel again the joy of the ride, and of
life itself.

JENNINGS ONE OF A KIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ It doesn't help that Gabe Jennings shares a
Jan. 25 birthday with Steve Prefontaine, who was America's greatest
distance runner when he died in a car crash in 1975 at the age of
24. But even without that eerie coincidence the comparisons still
would be made: the shaggy hair, the nonconformity, the guts with
which he runs, the potential for greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't get carried away, warns Vin Lananna, his coach at
Stanford, who is beginning to find the topic a bit tiresome. ``Gabe
Jennings is Gabe Jennings,'' he said this week, ``and I'm not sure
there are others like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings, who just six weeks ago claimed the outdoor NCAA 1,500
meter crown as a junior, Sunday became the first collegiate runner
since Jim Ryun in 1968 to win at 1,500 meters in the US Olympic
Trials when he ran it in 3 minutes 35.90 seconds, the fastest time
by an American this year.
</P>
<P>
   As he ran, dozens of friends and family members in the bleachers
coming off the backstretch provided the external accompaniment,
pounding drums meant to activate the internal beat Jennings, a
music major and drum player at Stanford, must feel to perform his
best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our heart's always pumping and our lungs are always heaving,''
said Jennings in an explanation typical of his unconventionality.
``It's when you're aware of it that the magic can happen. When I'm
not in that zone, I have a bad race; usually I don't hear rhythms
and if I do they're not in synch or the melodies I hear are
dissonant.''
</P>
<P>
   Known to climb into the stands at Stanford after finishing his
race to drum for the rest of the runners, Jennings has been heeding
his own beat since childhood, spent in a remote California town
called Forks of Salmon. There, his family used a battery to
generate electricity when they needed it, used firewood for heat,
ate straight out of their garden, and maintained their own water
line. ``It was definitely a rugged lifestyle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But still not as primitive as the mythmakers would have it. ``We
actually did have plumbing,'' said Jennings, despite plentiful
reports to the contrary. ``I think it's funny. People razz me about
it, raised by the coyotes.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was 13, he moved with his parents and sister to Madison,
Wis., so his father, Jim, could study ancient philosophy at the
University of Wisconsin. It was at Madison East High School that
Jennings discovered running, winning nine state titles, before
moving on to Stanford, where his teammates include Jonathon Riley
of Brookline, Mass., Andy Powell of North Easton, Mass., and
Michael Stember, who finished second to Jennings at the NCAAs and
third here.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one really knows what sort of plane Gabe exists on except
that it works for him,'' said Stember. ``We all do our best to turn
it into positive energy for the team. Sometimes that's a bit
difficult, but because he is entertaining to everybody it often
gets turned into a really fun show to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Lananna, for whom Jennings this spring helped win Stanford's
first NCAA championship in 66 years, said he sees his role as
providing perspective. ``I try to make sure (race) decisions are
made with his head, and not just gut or emotion,'' he explained,
while not trying to curb Jennings's instincts to run from heart,
often making the kind of early move he did here just 600 meters
into the race. ``With Gabe, his strength is his passion and the
excitement in everything he does.''
</P>
<P>
   The young man in the smock-like shirt and soft clogs who fed off
cosmic energy as ``the moon kept getting fuller and the air kept
getting fresher'' with the biggest race of his life approaching;
who said he knew he would win when he awoke from his afternoon
visualization session to notice that his foot was tapping,
nonetheless refuses to classify himself as a free spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to overthink my image or my lifestyle and just act
it, or be it,'' he said. ``My motto is to really live in the
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   That moment will soon be on the Olympic stage. There is no fear
in Jennings's deep brown eyes when he says: ``I'm just 21 years old
now, but I'm ready to start racing the big guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken, just once, like a typical runner.

ABC'S LATEST PEE-R CAMPAIGN A NEW LOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Is there honor among TV critics? Not in the
men's room.
</P>
<P>
   Several promotional posters placed above urinals in a
Ritz-Carlton hotel restroom in Pasadena went missing Monday soon
after they were installed to tie in with a news conference on ABC's
fall marketing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech ``billboards'' use CD-ROMs to communicate with men
as they answer nature's call. The voice of comedian Norm Macdonald,
star of the ABC series ``Norm,'' offers a number of observations,
such as, ``Oh, my God! Look at the size of that thing!'' and
``You're a mover and shaker and so am I. `Norm' moves to Fridays
this fall.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, quickly dubbed ``must-pee TV'' by critical
consensus, will initially target men's rooms in New York and Los
Angeles, but other markets may follow.
</P>
<P>
   Defending the ads, Mike Benson, senior vice president of
advertising and promotion for ABC, said, ``It's not that we'll go
anywhere, but we feel that they are appropriate, effective pieces
in our own voice and style that fit our attitude, and we figured
that this was the perfect place to advertise `Norm.'''
</P>
<P>
   No one copped to removing the signs, but maybe we should be
grateful for the pre-emptive strike.
</P>
<P>
   Forget all the ``Survivor'' and ``Big Brother'' clones the
networks are rushing into production to catch the ``reality'' wave.
The next big thing could very well be ``BattleBots'' on Comedy
Central.
</P>
<P>
   Picture ``WWF Smackdown!'' minus the sweaty guys and the folding
chairs. Toss in some futuristic-looking appliances with heavy
armament, and you've got ``BattleBots.''
</P>
<P>
   The cool thing about it is that it's not contrived reality.
There really are people who travel the robot-competition circuit,
trying to prove their homemade automatons _ some resembling
lawnmowers, others favoring the vacuum-cleaner-on-steroids look,
still others tending toward the mad scientist's gizmo with claws _
are superior in a world-domination, annihilate-the-other-guy sort
of way.
</P>
<P>
   Tentatively scheduled to debut in late August, the series' first
episodes will feature bouts taped last month in San Francisco.
Jason and Randy Sklar, twin brothers with a mind for comedy (MTV's
``Apartment 2F''), will host the show with ``Baywatch'' alumna
Donna D'Errico. Seattle's own Bill Nye (the science guy) will serve
as technical expert, offering insight during weigh-ins and
providing vital statistics on each competitor.
</P>
<P>
   The Sklars, who like to finish each other's sentences, point out
that there is nothing fake about robot rasslin'.
</P>
<P>
   Here's Randy: ``We can say without hyperbole ... ''
</P>
<P>
   And now Jason: `` ... that there is no greater drama in all of
sport.''

 &HT;    TIRED, TENSE MIDEAST NEGOTIATORS, CLINTON TALKING AROUND THE
CLOCK
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ President Clinton pressed Mideast negotiators
Tuesday in around-the-clock deadline diplomacy at nearby Camp
David, aiming to secure a peace treaty before his long-scheduled
departure for Japan on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak until nearly
4:30 a.m. (ET) Tuesday, as U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and National Security Adviser Samuel Berger held forth
into the pre-dawn hours with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   After a few hours of sleep, the negotiators were back at it for
talks expected to continue late into the night Tuesday, and White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart said aides were set to stage a signing
ceremony ``on a moment's notice,'' if an agreement were reached.
</P>
<P>
   As a week of talks drifted through their last scheduled day,
however, the outcome of negotiations remained in doubt, as Clinton
weighed whether to delay his take-off another day to buy more time
for a shot at peace in one of the most contentious regions in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The late nights and looming deadline were taking a toll on
negotiators, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People understand that there is not an open-ended or unlimited
amount of time,'' he told reporters at a daily news briefing.
``They're tired, but they're staying at it.''
</P>
<P>
   In one sign that Clinton might put off his departure, the White
House delayed until Wednesday the press flight for reporters
covering Clinton's trip to Japan. The press charter had been
scheduled to leave the Washington area Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is due in Tokyo Thursday afternoon for a bilateral
meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials won't say the meeting is non-essential,
but it's no secret that the agenda is light.
</P>
<P>
   Logistically, Clinton could postpone the meeting with Mori,
leave Washington Thursday morning and still arrive in Okinawa _ the
southernmost island in the Japanese archipelago _ in time for the
main event of his trip: the annual summit of the leaders of the
so-called Group of Seven richest nations, plus Russia.
</P>
<P>
   That could get him 24 hours of overtime to try to wrestle a
peace treaty out of the Camp David talks.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations are centered on the core issues in the
52-year-old Palestinian-Israeli dispute. Those include the question
of Palestinian statehood, the future of Jerusalem, territory and
security, and the fate of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of a strict news blackout agreed to by all
negotiating parties before the talks began, Lockhart, or his
deputies, have provided the sole official window into the talks for
roughly 300 members of the international media gathered in this
town of 4,400 to cover the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart has refused to discuss the substance of the talks and
has provided little information about the atmospherics or the
negotiating process itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can assume that I know lots of stuff,'' he told reporters
Tuesday, ``and I'm not telling you.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Washington-based Arab American Institute released
the results of a nationwide poll Tuesday that showed a majority of
American voters support the Palestinians' right to an independent
state.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 890 likely voters, conducted by New York-based
Zogby International July 14-17, showed 66 percent favored a
Palestinian state as well as 63 percent agreeing with Clinton's
handling of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The poll had a margin of error of +/-3.4 percent.

SNEAD TAKES A VERY SWEET SWING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ There was some milling around at the
first tee when the older gentleman in the sweatshirt sort of took
matters into his own hands and put the peg in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   With a swing that has lost none of its rhythm over the course of
seven decades, he rifled a perfect drive into the bright blue
Scottish sky, though he didn't bother to follow its flight. Truth
is, he couldn't have seen it had he tried. Further truth is, he
knew exactly where it would be, anyway: dead center, because the
swing is still true even if the eyes aren't.
</P>
<P>
   So Sam Snead, 88 and as colorful as ever, simply settled into
the passenger side of a golf cart and, with very little fanfare,
accepted a ride out to prepare for his next shot.
</P>
<P>
   Kids looking for autographs were more concerned with Tiger Woods
sightings, and some of today's professionals were too deep in their
preparation routine as they came down the 18th to pay attention to
the man in the trademark straw hat, but none of that fazed Slammin'
Sammy, who has returned to St. Andrews _ site of this year's
British Open, which begins Thursday _ to pay his respects one last
time to the birthplace of golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy being here and I will always cherish this course for
the rest of my life,'' said Snead, who accepted an invitation to
help usher this course _ and this tournament _ into a new century.
He will take part in a special Past Champions Challenge Wednesday,
with 22 former British Open champions playing a four-hole
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   It is a perfect fit, because beyond the fact that Snead is the
oldest living former champion, his only participation in this
tournament resulted in victory, right here at St. Andrews in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Snead being Snead, his first impression of the
historic layout prompted a most infamous exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came along beside the golf course and it did not look like
it was in very good shape,'' said Snead, recounting a story that
has been altered and embellished throughout the years, though it
has not lost any of its charm. ``I heard that they used sheep to
cut (the grass), so I finally said to a guy sitting beside me,
`What abandoned golf course is that?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Showing off a pretty good Scottish brogue, Snead laughed
heartily when he remembered the man's outrage: ``I will have you
know it is St. Andrews.''
</P>
<P>
   But Snead discounts the legend that he had disdain for the Old
Course.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a whole lot of shot-making to do a good score,'' he
said of his 290 total that was four shots clear of Bobby Locke and
Johnny Bulla. ``But it is a course where every time you play it you
respect it more.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Ben Hogan (who triumphed at Carnoustie in 1953), Snead was
1 for 1 in the British Open, but typical of that era, it was not a
great windfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cost me $2,000 to come over here in '46,'' said Snead. ``I
won the tournament and got $600. They said, `You coming back to
defend?' And I said, `You're kidding.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Many years later, after he won the British Seniors Championship,
Snead received a check for $460. ``Is this my tipping money?'' he
asked. Told that it was indeed his prize money, Snead laughed. ``I
said, `Don't call me, I'll call you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Many years later, and for an enitrely different reason, they did
call and Snead did say yes. Monday, he played two holes going out
(Nos. 1-2) and two coming in (Nos. 17-18), which is what
Wednesday's competition will be. The sweetest swinger the game ever
has known is many years removed from trying to kid himself into
believing he can still play, but he made the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``With my sight, I can't see a ball land 50 yards, so you know I
have no business even hitting the golf ball,'' said Snead.
</P>
<P>
   He just wants to enjoy this moment, show off the golden swing
that even today makes the pros stop and take note, and leave on
good terms with St. Andrews.

IT'S ANNE VS. EMILY ON PEI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Look out, Anne of Green Gables: There's a new girl in town, and
her name is Emily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emily,'' a musical about a troubled Prince Edward Island girl,
is drawing crowds at the Confederation Centre of the Arts in the
island capital of Charlottetown. And ``Emily of New Moon'' is an
award-winning television series that can now be seen in the United
States on some cable/satellite channels such as Movieplex.
</P>
<P>
   Both the musical and TV show are based upon a trio of novels by
Lucy Maud Montgomery, who also wrote ``Anne of Green Gables,'' a
book that will forever be associated with the late author's beloved
Prince Edward Island. For years, souvenirs of red-haired, pigtailed
Anne have saturated the island, and the Green Gables homestead is
something of a shrine. But nowadays mementos of dark-haired Emily
have wended their way into PEI souvenir shops _ even the one at
Green Gables. When the TV series began filming on the island, it
was a major topic of conversation. A cartoon in a local newspaper
went so far as to depict Anne on a psychiatrist's couch, lamenting,
``It's Emily this and Emily that!'' This summer, the ``Emily''
musical will play for its second year at the Confederation Centre,
and the acclaimed ``Anne of Green Gables'' will enter its 36th
season, making it Canada's longest-running musical.
</P>
<P>
   While both the Anne and the Emily stories concern an orphaned
girl growing up on the island in the early years of the 20th
century, the tales are hardly the same. For one thing, the first
Emily book was written about 15 years after ``Anne of Green
Gables,'' is more autobiographical, and reflects Montgomery's
increasing maturity. If ``Anne'' is a story told in pastels,
``Emily'' is related in richer, occasionally darker hues, making
for more compelling drama. While the Anne musical bubbles brightly
from the start, Emily's begins with the death of her father and her
upbringing by a stern, outwardly cold aunt. All is not gloom,
though: There is a lot of hope and humor _ and good songs, too.
</P>
<P>
   But if musicals about the plight of young island girls don't
call out to you, fret not: All summer long, Prince Edward Island is
a festival of plays, concerts, dinner theater, jazz, blues, art and
museum exhibits, and Highland and Celtic music and gatherings.
Under the auspices of the Confederation Centre alone are such
productions as the laugh-a-lot musical ``Forever Plaid''; the
ultra-energetic ``Barachois,'' with Acadian music, dancing, and
comedy; ``the Conjuror's Suite,'' a re-creation of an old-time
magic show; ``Celidh on the Road,'' featuring Celtic music, song,
and dance; ``Somewhere in the World,'' a rousing _ and free _
outdoor musical salute to Canada; and ``Drill Queens Comedy,''
featuring sketches, impersonations, and satirical melodies. Why,
one sketch even has a slightly tipsy Anne confronting Emily: ``For
36 seasons, I've owned this town. . . . And now, when I look in the
rear-view mirror, who do I see? You!''

Travel Trivia: Prince Edward Island is shaped like (a) a dagger,
(b) a crescent, (c) a figure-eight, or (d) a pair of pigtails?
(Answer at end of column.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a name: PEI may be the island of Anne of Green Gables, but
there's a restaurant/bike-rental shop in the town of St. Peters
called Anne of Red Doors. The building is a former fire station _
thus the red doors _ and the proprietor is named Anne. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quotable: ``The fairest land 'tis possible to see'' _ explorer
Jacques Cartier, after his first view of the reds and greens of
Prince Edward Island from his ship in 1534. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Snappy slogan: A message on a Prince Edward Island T-shirt reads,
``Boil a Tourist, Save a Lobster.'' (Lobster suppers are one of the
island's big draws.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Sound familiar? On PEI, you can find communities named Alaska,
Arlington, Albany, New Haven, Cambridge, Newton, and Springfield. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The flavor is locked in: An early 20th-century county jail in
Longworth, Prince Edward Island, is now a pizza palace. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Did you guess it? A crescent. &QL;

YOUR TALL SHIPS DREAMS CAN COME TRUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the hundreds of thousands of people who toured the Tall
Ships as they visited the East Coast (continuing on to Maine, and
then Halifax, Nova Scotia, before crossing the Atlantic), interest
in the vessels is high. For many, the event has sparked a dream to
sail aboard one.
</P>
<P>
   That dream can be a reality. A sailing vacation is an option
many are taking.
</P>
<P>
   Along the Maine coast there are windjammers galore, some listed
as national treasures. In the Caribbean, Windjammer Barefoot
Cruises has a fleet that sails regularly to interesting and
off-the-beaten-path islands.
</P>
<P>
   Star Clipper offers the Royal Clipper, the world's largest true
sailing ship. Windstar Cruises has three computer-operated sailing
vessels that sail the world. Even Club Med has a sailing outpost.
</P>
<P>
   Heading to Maine for a one- to four-day sail among the beautiful
islands of Penobscot Bay will give you a feel for what it's like.
North End Shipyard Schooners offers two vessels, the American Eagle
and Schooner Heritage. Windjammer Cruises has a fleet of 13 vessels
that sail from Rockland and Camden, Maine. These are all genuine
sailing vessels, cruising primarily in the Penobscot Bay area,
which is filled with islands. The American Eagle has auxiliary
power and is able to cruise farther to take part in the Gloucester
Schooner Race in September. Most of the sailings are for three or
four days, with a few up to seven days.
</P>
<P>
   For information, call Windjammer at 800-807-WIND or visit
www.sailmainecoast.com; for the North End fleet, call 800-648-4544
or visit www.midcoast.com/-schooner.
</P>
<P>
   Windjammer Barefoot is as casual as you'd expect from a company
that uses ``barefoot'' in its name. There are no crowds (just
64-124 passengers), no regimen, but there are land-based
eco-adventures. Its sailings are all six days in beautiful
Caribbean waters. For information, call 800-327-2601.
</P>
<P>
   For a real sailing adventure that touches on ports in Europe,
the Mediterranean, Southeast Asia, and the Caribbean, Star Clippers
(800-442-0551) can't be beat. The company's Star Clipper and Star
Flyer are based on the great clipper ships that once were built in
Boston. The new Royal Clipper is inspired by the Preussen of the
Flying P Lines, which from 1902-1910 dominated the sea lanes of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Windstar Cruises (800-258-7245) offers sailngs in the Caribbean,
Europe, Belize, and Costa Rica. The vessels offer a luxurious
computer-operated sailing experience. Club Med 2 (800-CLUB MED)
brings the fun of a Club Med village to sea, also on a vessel with
computer-equipped sails. It home ports in winter in Martinique.
</P>
<P>
   One of the newest sailing adventures is aboard the luxurious
three-masted Barquentine, the Lili Marleen. This genuine sailing
vessel carries just 50 passengers in modern comfort (it was built
in 1994). The Lili Marleen sails year round on seven-night cruises
from Dubai. For information, call Peter Deilmann Ocean Cruises at
800-348-8287.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Foliage cruise
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Regal Cruises will offer a 12-night foliage cruise from New York
on Sept. 17, calling on New England and Canadian ports. The
900-passenger Regal Empress will visit Newport, R.I.; Bar Harbor,
Maine; Quebec City, Quebec; Halifax, Nova Scotia; Charlottetown,
Prince Edward Island; and Corner Brook, Newfoundland. For
information, call 800-270-7245.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Free activities
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean is now offering rock climbing, miniature golf,
and ice skating free on its Voyager of the Seas, the world's
largest cruise ship. There was a charge for those activities when
the ship first began sailing.
</P>
<P>
   The free policy will be extended to the Explorer of the Seas,
sister ship to the Voyager, when it begins sailing on Oct. 28.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grand Voyages
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From Hong Kong and Vietnam to Fiji and Samoa and from the
islands of New Zealand to the Hawaiian Islands, the all-suite Seven
Seas Navigator will offer grand voyages during its inaugural
season. By combining two or more shorter cruises to create a Grand
Voyage of 21 to 58 nights, Radisson Seven Seas Cruises will offer
guests special combination fares, free upgrades to business or
first-class air, or extra savings from Oct. 3-Dec. 2. In addition,
those who secure their deposit with a credit card when booking
receive a shipboard credit of $1,000 per cabin ($500 a person). The
490-passenger Navigator will offer six cruises ranging from nine to
20 nights that can be built into a Grand Voyage.

&HT;     CONGRESS-WHITE HOUSE GAMESMANSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress and the White House maneuver like dancing
crabs these days, scuttling sideways instead of marching forward in
a direct manner.
</P>
<P>
   In this pre-convention season, the idea is to get us to listen
to what they say, not watch what they do. The emphasis is on
building issues, not a record of real achievement.
</P>
<P>
   This inevitably leads to devious public behavior. Take the
recent passage of a measure to eliminate the estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   With great fanfare, the Republicans rammed through the measure
even though they knew President Clinton had vowed to veto it. They
didn't even consider a compromise put forward by the Democrats that
would have greatly reduced the tax, wiping out the most
controversial aspects but falling short of giving the ultra-rich a
free pass altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans were going for a confrontation rather than
legislative results. They may temporarily end up with nothing,
hoping for a Bush presidency and a veto-free second go-around on
the issue next year.
</P>
<P>
   The game is being played with AmeriCorps as well. This is
Clinton's pet project, an initiative he sees as his domestic
version of President John Kennedy's famous Peace Corps. The
Republicans have been out to get it from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The House just voted to defund (translation: kill) it. The
Senate, which is slightly more friendly terrain, may or may not
rescue it.
</P>
<P>
   But in any case the president has promised to veto the vast,
$83.8 billion Veterans Administration-Housing and Urban Development
appropriations bill, in which the small AmeriCorps budget is
buried, if the agency does not get additional funding. You can bet
the House-Senate conference will quietly give him some of what he
wants here.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has asked for $534 million for AmeriCorps, up from its
present $353 million budget. Think about it. We are talking here
about a mere drop in the federal budget ocean. And the Republicans
are trying to make it an example of wild-eyed Democratic spending!
</P>
<P>
   The House also gave similar, longer-established programs funded
through the Labor-Health and Human Services appropriations bill the
cold shoulder. It approved the same level of funds as last year,
but no increase. The programs are the former ACTION agency, now
called Senior Service Corps, and the former VISTA, now called
AmeriCorps-VISTA.
</P>
<P>
   There too a veto threat suggests that _ surprise! _ more funding
will show up in the bill's final version.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have no real reason to dump on AmeriCorps except
to get Clinton's goat. The flimsy excuse is that the money can be
better used for tax cuts and lowering the national debt. But a
better move would be to slash really big-ticket items favored by
the GOP, such as unnecessary aircraft carriers and missile defense
systems that don't work.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans love to wield the budget-cutting knife only when the
programs are important to the administration and not to their own
constituents.
</P>
<P>
   AmeriCorps is vulnerable because it is relatively small, new and
not very visible. It has not gripped the public imagination as the
Peace Corps did in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton envisioned the program as extending our tradition of
citizen service to young people by encouraging them to volunteer to
help their fellow Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last six years, AmeriCorps members have taught, tutored
and mentored needy and non-English speaking pupils; run
after-school recreational programs and removed trash from
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Members, usually between 18 and 24, receive a living allowance
and, after a year of service, a lump sum of nearly $5,000 to help
pay for higher education or vocational training. Many of the local
programs are run by church coalitions and other religious agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, once called AmeriCorps a ``Great
Society-style boondoggle.'' But when he saw it in action in his
home state, he began to support it.
</P>
<P>
   So what's not to like in AmeriCorps? It isn't expensive. Insofar
as is known, it is scandal-free. It does good works, and it helps
to send kids to college.
</P>
<P>
   What's not to like, from the GOP point of view, is that it is
something nice dreamed up by that ogre Bill Clinton. That means it
has to be stamped out before voters get the incredible notion that
Clinton isn't all bad after all.

 &HT;    Armstrong miscalculates, runs out of energy on final mountain
stage
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MORZINE, France - Defending champion Lance Armstrong felt so
energetic early in the Tour de France's16th stage Tuesday that he
blew past the area where team workers were handing out
carbohydrate-loaded energy drinks and sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   He shouldn't have.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was within sight of a stage win when his strength
evaporated on the 5,500-foot Col de Joux-Plane, the last imposing
summit on the tour, and he was left behind by Germany's Jan Ullrich
and eventual winner Richard Virenque.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong finished eighth, 2 minutes and 1 second behind
Virenque. But Armstrong lost valuable time to Ullrich, who moved to
within 5:37 of the defending champion in the overall standings with
five stages remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was the hardest day of my life on a bike. I knew I was
in trouble,'' Armstrong said. ``I just tried to stay calm and be
conservative. In a situation and crisis like that, you can't panic.
I'm happy to be finished with the Alps.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Postal Service team director Johan Bruyneel said Armstrong
could have lost more time to Ullrich, but yielded only 1:51.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we lost to Ullrich was really a good outcome under the
circumstances,'' Bruyneel said. ``Lance had a hunger crisis. It
comes all of a sudden. When it happens, you have to relax and try
as hard as possible. It's just a thing that happens. He'll be OK.
He's perfect. He just ran out of fuel.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruyneel said Armstrong ate well Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his problems, Armstrong does not appear to be in danger
of losing the leader's yellow jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was probably the final day that riders could make up
huge gaps in time, although the Tour does not end until Sunday in
Paris. Ullrich finished second Tuesday, 24 seconds behind Virenque.
</P>
<P>
   Of the final five stages, four are better suited for sprinters.
The fifth, a time trial in Fribourg, Germany, on Friday, fits the
styles of Armstrong and Ullrich. Armstrong, who assumed the
leader's yellow jersey after the 10th stage, won all three time
trials during his 1999 Tour championship.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, other riders knew that Tuesday was the final day to
make up significant chunks of time on the leader.
</P>
<P>
   Marco Pantani, who has drawn the ire of Armstrong for his
comments to the European press, attacked from the beginning of the
stage.
</P>
<P>
   Pantani, winner of two mountain stages, took a huge gamble,
hoping that he could maintain a torrid pace through the Alps and
narrow the gap between himself and Armstrong. He started the day in
seventh place overall, 9:03 behind Armstrong and finished the
afternoon in 14th, 20:46 behind.
</P>
<P>
   Pantani's energy evaporated at the midway point of the 129-mile
stage, and he lost touch with the main riders. He finished 38th on
the same mountain he dominated in his 1998 Tour victory.
</P>
<P>
   Virenque, the second Frenchman to claim a Tour stage this year,
said Pantani's hefty pace came much too soon. ``No one could keep
up that pace,'' Virenque said. ``He attacked too far from the
end.''

&HT;     CELL PHONES TO CARRY RADIATION LABELS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an effort to reassure cell phone users, the cell
phone industry announced Tuesday that new cell phones will carry
labels describing how much microwave radiation they emit.
</P>
<P>
   Jo-Anne Basile, vice president for the Cellular
Telecommunications Industry Association _ the main cell phone trade
group _ said consumers will start to see the radiation labels on
new phones in the next six months.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's announcement comes amid growing health concerns
that cellular phones might be linked to diseases because a phone's
antenna emits microwave radiation and is typically held close to
the user's head.
</P>
<P>
   Over 95 million Americans use cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   The cellular phone industry steadfastly maintains that the
devices are safe and that the amount of radiation absorbed into a
user's head is far below dangerous levels.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission has set a maximum level of
radiation of 1.6 watts per kilogram of body tissue. CTIA says cell
phones don't exceed that limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of science shows that there are no adverse
health effects from the use of wireless phones,'' Basile said.
Still, the industry decided to publicize the radiation levels
because ``it's clear that there is increased interest in this
information,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientific studies have questioned the safety of the
devices. For example, two industry-sponsored health studies have
warned of possible damage to humans from cell phone radiation.
</P>
<P>
   This past May, a British government commission concluded that
children should be dissuaded from using cell phones until science
can conclusively determine whether absorbing radiation into the
head is safe.
</P>
<P>
   The British panel said there is no evidence that cell phones
cause harm but that it could not rule out the possibility that
future research might discover a link between disease and cell
phone use.
</P>
<P>
   The British report recommended that cell phone makers disclose
the radiation levels.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the industry action, a label on the outside packaging
of each new phone will state that this particular phone has been
tested by the manufacturer and meets government safety guidelines.
Inside the package, manufacturers will provide the specific
radiation measurement for the model and explain how the phones were
tested, Basile said.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's announcement was criticized by Dr. George Carlo,
a Washington, D.C.-based epidemiologist and lawyer who headed an
industry-sponsored cell phone safety project from 1993 until last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Carlo said the information being released by the manufacturers
would do little to help consumers determine if the phones are safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information is industry-generated data, it's not objective
in any way and can't be relied upon,'' Carlo said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, said Carlo, the radiation information does not
allow a consumer to make a judgment about whether one 10-minute
call is better or worse than 10 one-minute calls, he said. ``It
does not tell you what the cumulative effect of cell phone use
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlo added that releasing radiation information protects the
industry more than it protects consumers. ``I believe it's an
inoculation against future liability,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration, which is responsible for
regulating cell phones, has begun questioning whether the federal
safety limit fully protects consumers. The ceiling is focused on
protecting a user from phones that actually destroy cells by
heating them, the ``thermal'' effect. This limit may not protect
against ``any non-thermal effects of chronic exposure,'' the agency
said.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to settle the safety question, the FDA announced
last month that it would collaborate with the CTIA on new studies
to be conducted over the next several years.

CONSUMER PRICES RISE 0.6 PERCENT, BUT CORE RATE UP JUST 0.2 
</HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Consumer prices climbed in June for their biggest
gain in three months, but much of that increase was caused by an
8.8 percent surge in gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
   The consumer price index, a broad measure of price inflation,
rose 0.6 percent, a sharp acceleration from May's 0.1 percent rise.
But the core inflation rate, which strips out volatile food and
energy costs, rose only 0.2 percent for the third consecutive
month, the Labor Department said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Economists polled by Reuters had been expecting a 0.4 percent
increase in the overall consumer price index and a 0.2 percent rise
in the core rate.
</P>
<P>
   Although recent spikes in energy prices have affected most
Americans, the tame core rate of the consumer price index suggests
that the U.S. economy continues to experience little significant
inflation, even though the slow upward creep of the core CPI is
likely catching the eyes of economists and policy makers. In June,
the core CPI ran at a 2.4 percent annual rate, vs. 1.9 percent for
all of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Energy prices have fluctuated wildly in recent months, mostly
because of wrangling within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries about how much it should increase oil production this
year. Oil prices rose last month while markets pessimistically
awaited a late June meeting of OPEC. Prices dropped slightly from
their highs following OPEC's announcement that it would increase
its production quotas by roughly 700,000 barrels a day. But oil
prices have since seen wide swings as some producers consider
further production increases.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the rise in energy prices have had only a moderate
influence on other areas of the economy. Transportation costs,
which are influenced by energy prices, rose 1.8 percent in June,
after falling 0.5 percent in May and 0.7 percent in April. That
includes a 1.5 percent increase in airfares.
</P>
<P>
   ``The underlying trend in inflation is definitely higher this
year,'' said Joe LaVorgna, senior economist at Deutsche Bank. ``The
big question is whether the core CPI will continue to rise, lifted
in part by an energy spillover.''
</P>
<P>
   But some economists argue that the rise in airfares might also
be related to another trend, in which labor-intensive service
businesses, such as the airline, medical and education industries,
are facing price pressure as they try to pass along the burden of
rising workers' salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever degree of inflation we are seeing is more of a
services story,'' said Daniel Laufenberg, chief economist at
American Express Financial Advisors. ``Intense competition from
around the world is continuing to keep goods prices low, but
services are under pressure because of the ongoing labor
conditions.'' He noted that other labor-intensive areas, such as
medical care, are also seeing steady price increases.
</P>
<P>
   In other areas, however, consumer costs remained subdued or even
fell. Apparel prices fell for the third straight month, dropping
0.6 percent following a 0.2 percent decline in May. Other declines
in June included a 2.8 percent drop in personal computer prices, a
1.3 percent drop in phone service prices and a 1.3 percent drop in
tobacco prices.
</P>
<P>
   The benign rate of core inflation is not likely to alarm Federal
Reserve policymakers, who have raised interest rates six times in
the past year in an attempt to quell consumer and business demand
and avoid inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, higher interest rates slow demand by making it more
costly for consumers and businesses to borrow and spend, decreasing
the risk of inflation. But the lack of significant inflation
outside of oil prices, along with ``tentative and preliminary''
signs of an economic slowdown identified by the Fed, persuaded
policymakers to leave rates unchanged when they last met.
</P>
<P>
   Economists now have mixed opinions about whether the Fed will
continue to raise rates when it meets next in August, and are
hoping to glean a better understanding when Alan Greenspan, the
Fed's chairman, gives his semi-annual report to Congress on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future of monetary policy depends on how far the Fed will
allow the rate of inflation rate to advance _ that is, at what
annualized inflation rate does the Fed consider its goal of price
stability to be threatened?'' wrote economists from the Dismal
Scientist, a Web site focusing on economics. ``If the annualized
CPI rate remains above the 3.5 percent range, it is likely only a
matter of time before the Fed moves again.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Office Depot (ODP:NYSE) named Bruce Nelson its new
chief executive on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He succeeds David Fuente, who becomes nonexecutive chairman of
Office Depot's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, 55, was president and chief executive of Viking Office
Products before its acquisition by Office Depot in 1998. He has
since served as president of Office Depot International. Prior to
joining Viking in 1990, he was president and chief executive of BT
Office Products USA. Nelson also spent more than two decades in
various leadership positions at Boise Cascade Office Products.
</P>
<P>
   Looking forward, Nelson in a statement focused on the importance
of earning customer loyalty, of ``impressing them with fanatical
service across all channels and brands.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson also said the company's highest priority will be to grow.
Drawing on his prior position as president of Office Depot
International, Nelson said the company intends to capitalize on
international strength and will look to expand geographically. ``We
will be acquisition-minded as we do this in order to more rapidly
achieve our objectives,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Office Depot last week reported second-quarter earnings in line
with Wall Street's expectations according to a poll by First
Call/Thomson Financial. The company showed net profit of $58
million, or 18 cents a share, compared with $74.1 million, or 19
cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts had cut estimates after the
company issued a profit warning in May, saying soft sales that
month and weak currencies in foreign countries would undermine
second-quarter earning.
</P>
<P>
   The company still turned in sales growth of 12 percent, quarter
to quarter, to $2.6 billion from $2.3 billion, and worldwide
same-store sales rose 9 percent in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Office Depot lately traded up 5/16, or 5 percent, at 6 11/16.

VERMONT COLLEGE CAUGHT IN SPORTS FUROR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every year, hundreds of students at Champlain College throng to
Memorial Auditorium for the Great Northern Shoot-out. It's a rare
chance to show school spirit. But in two years, the rousing
season-opening basketball tournament will cease to exist.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the Champlain Beavers, long a powerhouse in
junior college sports, won't be around to host the games. Last
month, after students left for the summer, the small
career-oriented college in Burlington, Vt., eliminated all varsity
sports _ one of the few private, four-year colleges ever to take
such a step.
</P>
<P>
   The decision had nothing to do with financial problems, school
officials said. Abolishing varsity sports, they argue, is an
innovative way to free up resources for intramural sports, in
essence slashing top-notch basketball and soccer programs so more
students can take part in everything from kayaking to rock
climbing.
</P>
<P>
   Now, supporters of the varsity teams are reeling, saying that
the end of Beaver sports will hurt school morale and alumni
relations as well. They accuse the administration of disregarding
student support for the teams and defying the recommendation of a
special commission.
</P>
<P>
   And for some of the athletes and coaches, the end of varsity
sports is devastating. Bob Tipson, coach of the men's basketball
team for the last 33 years, who has the eighth best record in
National Junior College Athletic Association history, says the
decision will rip the heart out of the college.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel like you let some people down,'' Tipson lamented,
wondering, ``Was there something else I could have said? Was there
something else I could have done? It's not just the alums, it's the
ones that I haven't coached. The ones who will never get a chance.
It's really just sad.''
</P>
<P>
   In defending the college's decision, which takes effect in the
2002-2003 school year, Champlain president Roger Perry said the
administration spent much of the past year consulting students and
faculty. After surveys and meetings indicated a lackluster interest
in the varsity sports program compared with intramural sports, he
said, the trustees decided it would be better to spend the $500,000
annual varsity budget on a multimillion-dollar facility to increase
students' access to sports, including snowboarding and sailing.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, he said, is to quadruple the number of students on
campus involved in sports, so they're more likely to play than
watch. Now, only about 50 students participate on the three varsity
sports teams _ men's basketball and men's and women's soccer.
Champlain has 1,380 full-time students and 1,105 part-timers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were spending a lot of money for only a few students,''
Perry said. ``This was essentially a business decision. People say
universities don't know how to make priorities and choices. Well,
that's what we're doing. We want more inclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the administration is miscalculating the value
of the varsity sports program. Support from alumni might diminish,
they argue, while school spirit will wane, and nearly $1 million in
tuition money from student athletes will vanish.
</P>
<P>
   Janine Fagan, a 23-year-old center-forward on the women's soccer
team who moved from England to play for Champlain, scoffs at any
suggestion that students aren't interested in varsity sports.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever she goes, she said, people always admire that she plays
for Champlain, which won the NCJAA women's soccer national
championships in 1994 and 1998. The men's basketball team,
meanwhile, has been a top contender for the title five times in the
last decade and the men's soccer team took regional titles in the
1995 and 1997 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's devastating to think that a school with such a high
reputation for its sports program is going to end it all,'' Fagan
said. ``To carry the name on your shirt and your shoulder is very
important. This is like cutting off your nose to spite your face.
And in the long run, I think this could be the downfall of
Champlain.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial questions about the longevity of the varsity sports
program arose in the college's marketing department. Champlain
first began offering four-year bachelor's degrees in 1991. Now,
nearly 90 percent of the students seek such diplomas. The problem,
marketing officials said, is that each time a team wins a
high-profile game, the media mention they're competing against
junior colleges. That, Perry and other school officials say, gives
prospective students the wrong impression.
</P>
<P>
   The image problem sparked interest across the campus in the
Beavers joining a four-year athletic association, such as the
National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics. Perry and
trustees said it was simply too expensive for the college, which
has an operating budget of about $25 million, to maintain the
varsity program and launch a serious intramural program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is a series of tradeoffs,'' he said. ``Dollars have to
follow priorities. It's like a family budget. I would love a boat,
an airplane, and a Lexus. But we can't have it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Collins, chairman of the college's board of trustees,
insisted the decision serves the college's best interests. ``The
college and the student body has changed,'' he said. ``The best
information we have shows this is what students want. And one of
the reasons Champlain is healthy is because it makes difficult,
soul-searching decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics from students to professors argue the administration
misread student surveys in deciding they didn't care about varsity
sports. For example, a Champlain survey cites 43.5 percent of
students saying the varsity sports program doesn't interest them at
all. But that means 56.5 percent of the students are interested,
the critics note.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was always a lot of school spirit here, and a lot of
people rallied around the teams,'' said Elizabeth Hartwick, a
21-year-old senior who signed a petition with hundreds of other
students in favor of keeping the varsity teams. ``Our name was
athletics. That's what we were. Now it's gone, and I'm wondering
what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   So is David Mona, an assistant professor of accounting who has
taught at Champlain for 15 years. Like others at Champlain, he
doesn't understand how the trustees made the leap from considering
moving the teams to another league to eliminating them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The natural decision would have been to take the sports teams
out of a junior league and put (them) in a four-year sports
league,'' he said. ``That would be the capstone for the transition.
But I just can't understand this. We're financially healthy enough
to do both. Is this for the sake of being unique?''
</P>
<P>
   Now, after years of coaching at Champlain, both Tipson and Sue
Rand, the college's athletic director and women's soccer coach, are
mulling a future neither ever expected.
</P>
<P>
   Tipson, who has been at Champlain since studying there as an
undergraduate, and Rand, who has worked in the athletic department
for 18 years and has turned down several job offers, are both
dusting off their resumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had planned to spend the rest of my career here,'' Rand
said. ``But that's minor in the greater scheme. We have a history
and legacy of successful athletic programs. They're a large part of
the overall college experience. The students are going to miss
that.''

UNISYS SINKS ON DISAPPOINTING EARNINGS REPORT 
</HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Unisys (UIS:NYSE) reported a sharp drop in its
second-quarter earnings Tuesday, missing Wall Street's
already-lowered expectations, as the computer-services company saw
its revenues drop.
</P>
<P>
   The worldwide information services and technology company also
said its earnings and sales would be lower in the third quarter
than they were in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, in response, punished Unisys, sending the stock down
2 11/16, or 19 percent, to 11 7/16 around midday Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Bell, Pa.-based Unisys said that excluding an extraordinary
charge, its net income fell to $56.3 million, or 18 cents a diluted
share, from $118 million, or 37 cents a share, in the second
quarter of 1999. The latest results missed the revised consensus
estimate of 19 cents a share that had been expected by analysts
polled by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   On April 15, the company took an after-tax extraordinary charge
of $19.8 million, or 6 cents a share, for the early retirement of
its remaining $400 million of 12 percent notes, originally due
2003. Including the charge, the company's net income for the
quarter totaled $36.5 million, or is $56.3 million, or 12 cents a
diluted share.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue in the quarter declined 16 percent to $1.6 billion from
$1.9 billion in the year-earlier period. Excluding the impact of
foreign currency exchange rates, revenue in the quarter declined 13
percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Total worldwide orders, across 100 countries, showed
double-digit declines in the second quarter compared with a year
earlier, as did service orders. But technology orders saw
double-digit gains in the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   The company attributed the weakened results in part to a failure
to close several large technology contracts by the end of the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the continued slow recovery in our business and the
movement of some technology contracts into the fourth quarter, we
expect our third-quarter revenue to be down from a year ago and our
earnings per share to be below the second quarter 2000 level,''
Lawrence A. Weinbach, the company's chairman and chief executive,
said in a statement. ``We look for a pickup in revenue in the
fourth quarter, particularly in our technology business, with
earning per share relatively flat from year-ago levels.''

<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ There is an elegance to the women's discus
throw that often gets lost in the swirl of activity in most track
meets.
</P>
<P>
   Swirling was at a minimum Monday night on a quiet fourth day of
the U.S. Olympic Track &AMP; Field Trials. That, in turn, afforded a
good view of the women's discus competition.
</P>
<P>
   It was an excellent competition, too, won by UCLA's Seilala Sua
on her first attempt with a near American record throw of 216 feet,
2 inches. As it was, it was the longest throw by an American in 14
years, since Carol Cady of Stanford established the record of
216-10 in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Modesto native and UCLA grad Suzy Powell had a more consistent
series than Sua and uncorked an effort of 211-10 on her last throw
to finish second and land a spot on her second Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   In third was Kris Kuehl of Windom, Minn., who threw 202-7 to
make her first Olympic team at 29.
</P>
<P>
   With two women over 210 feet and another over 200, it's a good
group the United States will send to Sydney in September. All three
are good technicians in the ring as they spin around the 8-foot
circle and release the disc with a smooth slinging motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a good crew here,'' said Kuehl, whose name is
pronounced ``keel.'' ``We can do some damage in Sydney. I'm looking
forward to it. We've got a good pool of talent here. We're building
our presence and hopefully we can get some medals.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Sua, 22, and Powell, 23, intend to do in Sydney. To
accomplish that, they will have to be throwing in excess of 220
feet in two months. With a best of 212-10 last year, Sua ranked No.
6 in the world in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be in better shape then,'' Sua said. ``I'm looking to
medal, hopefully a gold. I'm just really excited. I can't believe I
threw 216 today. I shouldn't put limits on myself.''
</P>
<P>
   After Sua won the NCAA championship in June for the fourth
straight year, her coach, Art Venegas, encouraged her to get in
better shape for the Olympic trials. Maybe ``encouraged'' wasn't
exactly what he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My coach said to lose weight, that I was too fat,'' said Sua,
who is 6-1 1/2 and 240 pounds. ``So I lost a couple pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Venegas' admonition had anything to do with Sua's
performance Monday night at Hornet Stadium is debatable. But what
she did on the first round definitely put pressure on the rest of
the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was planning on getting a good throw early,'' Sua said.
``I'm really happy with myself. I just wanted to get a good throw
early and make them chase it. When it came off my hand I knew it
would be a good one. When it hit, I was amazed. It was cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Sua said she wasn't thinking about Cady's record, though. She
was simply happy with the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' Sua said. ``I can't believe I made the Olympic
team, representing the USA.''
</P>
<P>
   For Powell, it's her second time representing the USA. At 5-10
1/2 and 155 pounds, Powell is more svelte than her former UCLA
teammate. She relies on quickness in the ring and a slingshot arm
to propel her discus.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a big throw like that early, it puts a lot of pressure
on us,'' Powell said. ``It's a healthy rivalry. It helps both of us
. . . I definitely think I have the capability of being a medal
contender. My training tells me I am throwing the distances that
have historically been in that range.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the more competitive women's discus, the women's
javelin was won by Lynda Blutreich on her first throw with an
effort of 191 feet, 2 inches. Since no American, including
Blutreich, has made the Olympic qualifying standard for the event,
she will be the only U.S. women's javelinist in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be nice to have some company,'' said Blutreich, an
assistant track coach at Duke. ``We have some great talent coming
up. We need to get the women's javelin going.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Kreiner was second at 187-2, with Emily Carlsten third with
a throw of 186-11.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four women's throws events in track and field, the
javelin is by far the worst among Americans. The event has
seriously regressed since the days of Kate Schmidt and Karen Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just that all the other events are (contested) in high
school, so there's no feeder system (for the javelin),'' Blutreich
said. ``The development is just not there. Only 13 states, I think,
throw it in high school, maybe less than that. The javelin is
something you have to start when you're really young.''
</P>
<P>
   Blutreich, 28, first picked up the javelin when she was 18 after
swimming, playing basketball and throwing the shot when she was
younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a hard transition for me,'' she said. ``It's
different than throwing a ball. I have a gun (for an arm). I'm just
trying hard to use it. You've got to be explosive, you need to be
quick, you need to be in good shape, because the javelin is really
hard on your body. If you do it wrong it hurts even more.''
</P>
<P>
   And watching American women try to throw the javelin hurts even
more than that. In comparison, the discus is downright sublime.

WHEN BAD MOVIES GET WORSE (AND STILL MAKE A FORTUNE) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL KELLEY   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The only thing louder than the ringing of the cash register for
``Mission: Impossible 2'' is the outcry of the moviegoers who've
been suckered into seeing the film.
</P>
<P>
   Or have they been suckered? ``Mission: Impossible 2'' is the
newest entry in a unique category: Bad movies that everyone sees,
and nearly everyone dislikes.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of movies are critic-proof; audiences flock to them
regardless of what the critics say. But only a handful are
word-of-mouth-proof, and contain something so irresistible that
you'll pay to see them even if a person you trust says he hated it
from start to finish.
</P>
<P>
   Such films are a fairly recent phenomenon, and, although it is
easy to knock them, they command a grudging respect. That's because
nearly all are mammoth in scope and size, which is one reason why
they are irresistible. Only a few filmmakers possess the know-how
to deliver a movie that large.
</P>
<P>
   Herewith, then, is a selective chronological survey of
Hollywood's latest genre.
</P>
<P>
   ``INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM'' _ Steven Spielberg's
``Raiders of the Lost Ark'' (1981) was grand fun _ a 1940s serial
brought to 1980s life. This numbingly gruesome sequel inexplicably
gets everything wrong, but its chief offense is its sadistic
tableau of sickening tortures.
</P>
<P>
   Moviegoers who suffered through the gory melee were singularly
appalled, but telling their friends about it did nothing to
discourage the parade of ticket buyers who rushed to the film
throughout the summer of 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``DIE HARD 2: DIE HARDER'' _ If this film had been even half as
good as the first ``Die Hard'' (1988), the audiences who hurried to
it in record numbers would have been satisfied. Instead, they got a
moribund follow-up from a new director (the dreaded Renny Harlin,
who would go on to ``Cliffhanger'' see below), riding herd on a
script laden with unfathomable coincidences, a poor supporting
cast, and grainy photography riddled with close-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Only the presence of a nonplussed Bruce Willis reminded them
that the 1990 movie was part of an established franchise. For Part
3, ``Die Hard with a Vengeance,'' original director John McTiernan
returned to resurrect the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``CLIFFHANGER'' _ This 1993 mess about Rocky Mountain rescue
rangers made a ton of money, especially overseas, but left
audiences so angry that it just about killed Sylvester Stallone's
career. The erstwhile superstar had to gain 20 pounds and take a
cut in pay to be taken seriously in ``Copland'' (1997), but when
that film flopped, he disappeared from movies altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``TWISTER'' _ A truly soporific time-waster about amateur
scientists who chase tornadoes, this 1996 film hung its hat on
lavish, computerized storm effects. These sequences occupied most
of the movies running time ... yet, it was still boring!
Nonetheless, audiences flocked to it all summer, even after being
told that the film's signature image was a flying cow.
</P>
<P>
   ``MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE'' _ Audiences didn't seem to care that the
plot of this 1996 film was impossible to follow (it was even mocked
on the 1997 Oscars), even though every critic writing about the
movie mentioned it. They were drawn by the promise of Tom Cruise
fleeing a helicopter while stuck to the roof of a train, in a
tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``GODZILLA'' _ Arriving on the heels of a promotional campaign
that literally lasted years, this 1998 remake of the Japanese
kitsch classic unveiled a ``new Godzilla who looked like a reject
from the cutting room floor of ``Jurassic Park.'' Dark and gloomy
rather than fast and exciting, the film even left little kids
feeling cheated. The movie's human element was as bland and generic
as the computerized monster, with Matthew Broderick succeeding only
in making Raymond Burr, the star of the 1956 original, seem macho
by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``STAR WARS EPISODE 1: THE PHANTOM MENACE'' _ Devoted ``Star
Wars'' fans grew a generation older waiting for this long-promised
``prequel.'' Then they, along with most moviegoers last summer,
watched in silent amazement as the finished product creaked along
for two hours. The sole fragment of news value to emerge from the
film was the fleeting charge of racism leveled by watchdog groups
at one of its computerized characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT'' _ Finally, my favorite _ a 1999
semi-professional film which cost almost nothing but with a clever
ad campaign that reaped millions. The hype promised something
different, and did it ever deliver: A shot-on-video, ersatz
documentary with a plot that was almost as difficult to follow as
the first ``Mission: Impossible.''

   OLYMPICS-SYDNEY _ SYDNEY, Australia _ It's Friday night, and the
musky aroma of Australian manhood saturates the Oaks, a pub on the
north side of Sydney Harbour that's as big as a Wal-Mart. Mobs of
men are standing around talking rugby over schooners of beer. Some
are furiously working the slot machines everyone calls ``pokies.''
Others are charring slabs of meat on a barbecue pit out in the
courtyard. There's something odd about the round table by the door.
Not only does it include several women _ eating pizza no less _ but
some of their accents sound rather alien. ``I remember when I left
Atlanta,'' one of them says, ``my mover asked, `What's the deal
with Sydney? It seems like we've been moving everyone to Sydney.'''
The deal with Sydney, of course, is the Olympics. Four years ago
tonight, Muhammad Ali lit the caldron that signaled Atlanta's star
turn on the world stage. For some Atlantans, it wasn't enough. At
least 200 veterans of the 1996 Games have moved on to Australia to
be part of the first Olympics of the new millennium. (Auchmutey,

LAMB LOIN WITH BASIL CRUST 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This is the fifth of eight columns by Michel Richard, the
chef and owner of Citronelle in Washington; this was written with
MARIAN BURROS.) 
 By MICHEL RICHARD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first time I tasted basil, in a soup, it became my favorite
herb _ and it wasn't even fresh. Before the 1970s in France, it was
almost impossible to find fresh herbs. They didn't become plentiful
until the development of nouvelle cuisine. When I discovered fresh
basil it changed my life.
</P>
<P>
   In July and August I use a lot of it, and I love to use it as a
coating on a roasted loin of lamb. When the meat is sliced there is
the beautiful green of the crust, and the gorgeous pink of rare
lamb, the colors arranged on a pale creamy bed of quickly cooked
fennel. When I make this I hope it transports my guests in
Washington to Provence.
</P>
<P>
   I like this combination much better than the traditional lamb
persillade. Persillade is a mixture of a lot of butter, bread
crumbs, parsley and garlic. The crust is too thick and too rich,
and it doesn't stick very well to the lamb. I use egg to help the
basil crust adhere to the lamb; that makes the lamb easier to cut.
I also warm the basil quickly in oil before adding it to the bread
crumbs to set the color and improve the flavor.
</P>
<P>
   There are three steps to cooking the loin, a cut you can get by
asking your butcher to debone a rack of lamb to obtain the loin. I
saute the meat to brown and caramelize the outside, then I roast it
a bit, coat it with the basil crust and roast it again. Doing this
in stages means the basil crust keeps its bright color, as it
doesn't have to be cooked so long.
</P>
<P>
   The anise flavor of the fennel makes a good marriage with the
basil. To keep the flavor and crunch of fennel, I barely cook it.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LAMB LOIN WITH BASIL CRUST AND FENNEL  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the lamb:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   20 large basil leaves, washed and completely dried
</P>
<P>
   1 cup vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   { cup fresh bread crumbs
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, peeled
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 12-ounce boneless lamb loins, silver skin and fat removed
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   { cup chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons flour
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg, beaten
</P>
<P>
   4 sprigs thyme, for garnish
</P>
<P>
   For the fennel:
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces (1 small bulb) fennel, sliced into fine ([ inch or
less) julienne
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons Pernod, pastis or other anise-flavored liqueur, or 1
teaspoon anise seed
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   Juice from 1 lemon
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper.
</P>
<P>
   1. To prepare lamb: In a small saucepan, heat oil to 300
degrees. Place half the basil leaves in oil until they turn dark
green, 30 to 50 seconds. Transfer to paper towels to drain, and
repeat with remaining basil.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a food processor, combine basil, bread crumbs, garlic and
salt and pepper to taste. Blend thoroughly until mixture is fine in
texture and bright green. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   3. Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Season lamb loins with salt and
pepper to taste. In large saute pan over very high heat, heat 2
tablespoons olive oil and add lamb. Saute until well-browned on all
sides, about 5 minutes. Transfer to flameproof baking pan; roast
for 12 minutes, turning two or three times.
</P>
<P>
   4. Remove loins and keep warm; they may be held for up to one
hour. Discard fat from pan, and place pan over medium heat. Stir in
broth, scraping bottom of pan well, and allow liquid to reduce by
half. Season with salt and pepper, and strain into a small
saucepan. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   5. Roll lamb loins in flour to coat evenly; pat to remove excess
flour. Spread basil-bread crumb mixture across a baking sheet.
Brush loins evenly with beaten egg and roll in bread crumb mixture,
pressing firmly so crumbs will adhere. Return loins to a 300-degree
oven until crust is very lightly browned and loins have reheated,
about 5 minutes. While loins brown, prepare fennel.
</P>
<P>
   6. In a medium saucepan, combine fennel, olive oil, Pernod,
sugar and lemon juice. Place over medium heat, and saute until
fennel is slightly wilted, about 1 minute. Remove from heat, and
season with salt and pepper to taste.
</P>
<P>
   7. To serve, place saucepan with lamb juices over low heat to
warm. Cut each lamb loin into six slices. Divide fennel among four
plates, and arrange slices of lamb on top. Drizzle lamb juices
around plates, and garnish with thyme sprigs. Serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

 &HT;    Aaron Rents planning major facility expansion in Texas, Georgia
 &HT;    By Renee DeGross
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Aaron Rents, the nation's third-largest rent-to-own
furniture retailer, is buying a manufacturing plant in Texas and
expanding another in South Georgia as it continues adding stores.
</P>
<P>
   Founder R. Charles Loudermilk said Tuesday the furniture rental
and rent-to-own company paid $3 million for a 150,000 square-foot
facility near Houston in Sugar Land, Texas. Plans call for more
than doubling the size and using it as a distribution plant and to
manufacture upholstered furniture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas is our largest state for business,'' Loudermilk said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cairo, Ga., facility will expand by another 100,000 square
feet, adding up to 100 workers, Loudermilk said. Construction will
begin in about two months.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion will help the company, which has 11 plants, open
80 new stores this year. Most are franchise locations.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Rents has 176 franchise stores, with another 120 planned
over the next few years. The company began franchising Aaron rental
purchase stores in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had 33 consecutive quarters of record revenues without a
blip,'' Loudermilk said.
</P>
<P>
   Sales over the past eight years have increased from $226.9
million to $437.4 million. Profit last year was $25.6 million, up
from $21.5 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Aaron Rents hasn't attracted much notice on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a high-flying company,'' Loudermilk said.
``Investors are looking to make a bit hit. But when the Internet
craze levels out and the legitimate players work to the top, the
investing public will look at staple businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Loudermilk founded the company with his mother, Addie, in 1955.
Now in his early 70s, Loudermilk said he isn't ready to retire, but
added he has four potential successors in line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're in good hands if something happens to me,'' said
Loudermilk. ``But I'm not retiring so long as I'm having fun and
have my health.
</P>
<P>
   Loudermilk named, in alphabetical order for fairness, the
company's four top executives as possible candidates for the
company's top position: Ken Butler, Gil Danielson, Robert ``Robin''
Loudermilk, his son; and Ed Quinones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some say my son would take it over,'' Loudermilk said. ``But I
would only do it if he wanted the job, and would do the job. Here
we let cream rise to the top and create an atmosphere that's free
flowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron's business has three segments: office rental, household
short-term rental, and lease to own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept is proven,'' said John Baugh, an analyst with
First Union Securities. ``It's mostly for customers that can't
qualify for credit and it's a rental transaction with an option to
own at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron also rents furniture, appliances and electronics,
including big-screen televisions.

&HT;     PROVINCETOWN: WHERE FUN MEETS SURF

 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVINCETOWN, Mass. _ The man in the bow held one oar out of the
water, feathering the other to act as a rudder. His partner in the
stern gamely kept pulling with both oars. Slowly, the chunky
rowboat turned, its prow now aimed directly at the Provincetown II,
the largest Cape Cod Bay scenic cruiser, which was moored to the
foot of MacMillan Wharf.
</P>
<P>
   With a little more maneuvering, its crew managed to bring it
alongside the cruiser, but it was a precarious spot. The usually
calm waters of Provincetown Harbor were churned up by a steady
stream of boats making their way to the processional lineup at the
other side of the wharf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Father!'' called a woman who had been hanging on the rail
of the larger vessel, peering down at the rowboat bobbing 20 feet
below. ``Maybe you better bless 'em early. I don't think they can
make it around again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. John Raposo of St. Peter's Church in Provincetown
obligingly shook the aspergillum, and a spray of holy water
droplets from the wand went over the side and onto the rowboat and
its occupants.
</P>
<P>
   The 53rd annual Blessing of the Fleet had begun _ 15 minutes
early, with that small interloper jumping the line. But, hey, it
was Father John's first crack at the job, and everyone likes to put
his own stamp on an event.
</P>
<P>
   The event is the culmination of a three-day festival each June
that marries the pervasive Portuguese heritage with tourist kitsch,
both endemic to this fishing port.
</P>
<P>
   Parties, concerts, exhibits, fishing derbies for adults and
kids, and the arrival of dozens upon dozens of boats of all sorts
ushers in the high season for P-town.
</P>
<P>
   On this sweltering Sunday, as the Cape Cod Fiddlers held forth
on a makeshift stage down the wharf, and a procession carried a
statue of St. Peter (the apostle known as The Fisherman) to the end
of the wharf, the crowds gathered to walk the gangplank onto the
Provincetown II to get the best view of the procession of boats.
</P>
<P>
   The blessing originated as a special event for the fishing
fleet, but it has grown in scope each year. This time it included
speedboats, fishing boats, sightseeing boats, pontoon boats, the
new Midnight Gambler that offers thrillseekers gaming tables
offshore, even an inflatable one-man craft that made the rowboat
look like a cabin cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   Festooned with pennants and flags, crewed by girls in bikinis
and shirtless, buff young men in cutoff jeans or by grease-stained
working sailors, the boats passed in a seemingly endless parade.
</P>
<P>
   Father John kept spritzing water, the boaters kept waving and
whooping in return, and the crowd that had trooped onto the
Provincetown II crowded the rail so energetically that the cruiser
noticeably listed to port.
</P>
<P>
   It is summer in P-town, the pace now at full bore. It will not
be slowing down until mid-September. At the northern tip of the
Outer Cape, this town renowned for its art galleries, cafes,
nightclubs, clever landscaped alleys, colorful cottages and guests
houses and family-friendly/gay-friendly attitude will continue to
be packed with strollers, shoppers, sightseers and assorted other
folks.
</P>
<P>
   The seasonal shops along narrow, bustling Commercial Street that
runs the length of town are vying with the year-round businesses
for tourist dollars. In a leisurely stroll, you come across
everything from a Hallmark store to a drag nightclub, from fine
dining to a saltwater taffy shop, from modern home decor offerings
to antique finds.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the major draws on the P-town schedule beyond the
plethora of clubs, bistros, drag reviews, art exhibits, sunbathing,
kite flying, bicycling, fishing, swimming, dune tours, sailing and
dining:

NBC WILL FOLLOW OTHERS INTO THE REALITY FRAY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
PASADENA _ NBC executives surprised reporters with an unlikely mea
culpa for not diving into the reality-TV trend more quickly,
despite the critical caning of CBS's ``Big Brother'' and overall
bland ratings for such programming outside of ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' and ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Reality programming is definitely here,'' Scott Sassa,
president of NBC West Coast, declared Tuesday during the
semi-annual TV press tour. ``This is not a fad; it's a trend that's
going to be around for a while. The line of what is acceptable has
definitely been blurred. It's a moving target defined by public
tastes and public sentiment. We weren't as aggressive as we should
have been in pursuring that type of programming.''
</P>
<P>
   Sassa conceded that the network's success in traditional
fictional programming and its adherence to a concrete, less fluid
schedule than competitors CBS, ABC and Fox contributed to NBC's
flat-footed response to reality TV's explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our success in story form hurts us in (developing reality
shows),'' he said. ``Because of our stability, we're more
vulnerable because we have none of those shows.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC was second in the network ratings for the much sought-after
18-49 viewer demographic behind ABC, whose success can be planted
squarely on ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Reality programming will likely pop up on NBC next summer,
despite the added costs of generating original programming during
the season when viewers are watching the networks the least.
</P>
<P>
   ``One smart thing about placing them in summer is that they're
against competition that's not as great,'' Sassa said, admitting
that due to the fact that such programs have such short shelf lives
_ they can't really be repeated or syndicated _ their ostensibly
lower price tag is misleading.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tricky field _ one of the trepidations is that you
don't want to inhibit the brand of quality we've established with
NBC over the years,'' Sassa said.
</P>
<P>
   Garth Ancier, president of NBC Entertainment, added, ``We can't
ignore this as something that's going to go away. The public spoke,
and they want these shows. The challenge is not just chasing a
clone (of ``Survivor'' or ``Millionaire''). We're trying to find
the next genre of this programming that will have some life. We've
heard every variation of putting people on a bus or train or
whatever and have them kicked off one by one. Nothing we've seen so
far is something we're happy announcing (as being in
development).''
</P>
<P>
   Sassa suggested that criticisms that series such as ``Big
Brother'' have debased network airwaves are ``not a good thing or
bad thing. It is what it is. Public sentiment and morals have
changed. I'm not comfortable making value judgments of other
people's programming.''
</P>
<P>
   In other news, Sassa dismissed published rumors that he would
soon be fired (Allison Janney of ``The West Wing'' and Megan
Mullally of ``Will &AMP; Grace'' mocked the rumors in a sketch
introducing Sassa to the press conference).
</P>
<P>
   Ancier also tried to quell rumors that ``The Michael Richards
Show,'' featuring the former ``Seinfeld'' star as a bumbling
private detective, was in creative turmoil. NBC scrapped the
original pilot and has added William Devane, ``Saturday Night
Live's'' Tim Meadows and Amy Farrington to the cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that we had the right idea (in the pilot), and the
right executive producers and star, but that we had not fleshed out
the concept enough,'' Ancier explained.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, he was on his own with these bits of physical humor.
Scripts past the pilot are promising. We've hired onto the staff
someone who writes detective stories to make it more workable.''
</P>
<P>
   Other cast additions announced by Ancier included feature film
actors Tom Conti, Lili Taylor, Hope Davis and Bebe Neuwirth to the
cast of ``Deadline,'' starring Oliver Platt as an investigative
journalist. Paul F. Tomplins of ``Mr. Show'' will join the cast of
``DAG,'' starring David Alan Grier as the First Lady's bodyguard,
and Oscar-winner Dianne Wiest will join ``Law &AMP; Order.'' Also,
Ancier announced that ``Tucker,'' a new family comedy, would air
Mondays at 8:30 p.m. and ``3rd Rock from the Sun'' would return to
Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m.

   Ancier also announced that Steven Spielberg's fictional drama
about the Marines, ``Semper Fi,'' was expected to be a midseason
replacement series, though he admitted, ``We're looking for a show
runner to run it. It's a pretty ambitious show _ we'll be filming
all over the world, and you need a show runner willing to commit
his life to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other midseason replacements: the comedies ``Three Sisters,''
``Go Fish,'' ``Dog Days,'' about talking dogs, and an untitled
series starring Tony winner Kristen Chenoweth, and two possible
dramas, ``News from the Edge'' and ``This Life.'' And Ancier
announced a new comedy in development for fall 2001, from Drew
Carey and Bruce Helford, inspired by an episode of ``The Drew Carey
Show'' broadcast live and incorporating material both scripted and
improvised. &QL;

WHAT'S FRAGRANT IN THE FIELD IS PERFUME ON THE PLATE 
</HEADLINE>

   In Provence, lavender weights the summer air with a heady
fragrance and splashes across the landscape in thick, undulating
rows of vibrant purple. It shares the dry soil and hot sun with
other better-known herbs _ thyme, rosemary, sage, tarragon and
oregano _ but lavender is the star, prized for its bouquet, a clean
aroma at once floral and woodsy.
</P>
<P>
   Lavender is used mostly for its fragrance in Provence. But in
New York, far from the capital of this redolent crop, a strange
thing happened when farmers started selling lavender. People
started cooking with it.
</P>
<P>
   Lavender is in Greenmarkets and on menus all over New York City
this summer. Chefs are scattering the tiny flowers over salads and
using them to infuse sauces for fish and lamb. They are flavoring
ice creams and other desserts with lavender's haunting essence. A
cook bold enough to experiment will discover a surprisingly
seductive herb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lavender adds something indescribable to a dish,'' said Debra
Ponzek, the owner of Aux Delices, a catering shop in Greenwich,
Conn. ``People are more familiar with it as a fragrance than as a
taste, but it adds an unusual, soft, flowery essence.''
</P>
<P>
   Its scent is everywhere, in the cluster of tiny purple flower
buds and in slender stems branched with small leaves often
resembling spindly rosemary. Lightly crush it and the aroma is
yours.
</P>
<P>
   The aroma drives the flavor. As the 18th-century French
gastronome Brillat-Savarin put it, ``Smell and taste form a single
sense, of which the mouth is the laboratory and the nose is the
chimney.'' Lavender brings this theory to life.
</P>
<P>
   Just a branch or two used to garnish a poached chicken breast, a
round of goat cheese on a salad, or some moist, sliced white
nectarines will add a whiff of floral elegance.
</P>
<P>
   It is a powerful herb and has to be used sparingly in cooking.
Too much can overwhelm a dish with a resinous pungency that's
almost soapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put it in just at the last minute because, like cilantro,
you have to be careful not to overdo it,'' said Antoine Bouterin, a
native of St. Remy-de-Provence and the owner of Bouterin, on East
59th Street. He uses fresh lavender flowers as a garnish and to
enhance the lavender honey in marinades and glazes for duck and
chicken.
</P>
<P>
   t's not clear whether lavender is so prevalent lately because
there is more of a supply or more of a demand. Richard Farnabe, the
chef at Lotus in the meatpacking district, who once cooked in the
South of France, said that he never saw fresh lavender in this
country before but now all his suppliers have it.
</P>
<P>
   Cristina Spindler, the owner of the Peconic River Herb Farm, in
Calverton, N.Y., said demand has been ``unbelievable'' as ``lots of
people have discovered it for their gardens because of the
fragrance and because it repels insects, and some want to know how
to use it for cooking.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Provencal kitchen, fresh lavender _ lavandou in the local
dialect _ shows up mainly in confectionary or in ice creams and
vinegars. With thyme, oregano, savory, rosemary and marjoram, it is
often included in the mixture known as herbes de Provence, which
adds a distinctive flavor to game birds and lamb. Delicately
fragrant lavender honey is used in making nougat.
</P>
<P>
   New York chefs are using lavender in some traditional ways, in
creamy desserts like the lavender panna cotta at Abajour on the
Upper East Side and the carmeline, a kind of pastry cream, scented
with lavender at Cello, on East 77th Street. Alex Astienza, the
pastry chef at Patria in the Flatiron district, sees lavender as a
little like cardamom, which also has a perfume-like quality, and
combines it with quince in a confit to serve alongside honey ice
cream.
</P>
<P>
   Outside New York, lavender is also having an impact, in creme
brulee, for example, at Absinthe in San Francisco and the Jefferson
in Washington. Chefs in California, among them Alice Waters and her
disciples, have long been partial to it, cutting branches to use as
flavoring and garnish. But this is the first time it's been so
popular in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Lee, the executive chef at Daniel, grows five kinds of
lavender in his garden in Port Washington, N.Y. He uses it to
flavor lamb with pine nuts. At Cafe Boulud, the executive chef,
Andrew Carmellini, infuses lavender in broth to flavor an artichoke
and goat cheese salad.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs are also using lavender in more inventive ways, dropping a
chic new name on their menus. At Revel, on the Upper East Side,
Maurizio Marfoglia glazes fresh sardines with lavender honey and
adds a bit of fresh lavender as a garnish. Farnabe dapples a
risotto cake with lavender flowers to serve alongside squab. John
Tesar at Vine, in the financial district, scatters lavender and
chive flowers on crispy sweetbreads and pappardelle; he said they
cut the richness of the meat.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Woodside, the chef at Nicholson, on East 58th Street,
adds a whiff of lavender to roasted langoustines by including the
flowers in a light accompanying sabayon. ``I'm familiar with
lavender from England,'' said Woodside, who previously worked at
the Connaught Hotel in London. ``I haven't seen it so much here, so
I thought, `Why not use it?'''
</P>
<P>
   Fresh figs do well roasted with lavender honey, then strewn with
lavender buds. Terrance Brennan of Picholine, near Lincoln Center,
adds figs and lavender to his Cavaillon melon soup.
</P>
<P>
   Ponzek, at Aux Delices, infuses milk with lavender to fold into
cake batter. She also adds it to her own herbes de Provence blend
and makes a lavender syrup, which she bottles and sells. ``The
syrup is great as a finish for a kir royale,'' Ponzek said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; (MORE)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   When making an infusion or syrup for ice cream or sorbet with
the flowers, it's important to strain them out because they will
turn the mixture an unpleasant gray if left in longer than about a
day. The only way to obtain a lavender color for ice cream or
sorbet is to add an ingredient like grape juice, blueberry puree or
food coloring.
</P>
<P>
   For syrups as well as ice creams, sorbets and syrups, Spindler
of the Peconic River Herb Farm in Calverton, suggested using hybrid
varieties from Provence like Lavandula grosso and Lavandula
intermedia, which she said are finer than the popular French hybrid
lavandin.
</P>
<P>
   Munstead, which sports particularly attractive flower buds, and
Hidcote, which has especially dark purple flowers and intense
flavor, are the English kinds most widely available. In a couple of
weeks, Stokes Farm in Old Tappan, N.J., which grows lavandin, will
also have bunches of Hidcote and Munstead at the Union Square
Greenmarket.
</P>
<P>
   There are hundreds of varieties of lavender. Peconic River Herb
Farm sells 18 kinds. All are edible, Spindler said, but the hardy
varieties are best because they have better flavor. They are often
identified as perennials, and their flowers have the sweetest and
most pronounced aroma.
</P>
<P>
   If you buy it in pots and want to cook with it, look for French
hybrid lavender or English Hidcote and Munstead. Dried lavender
intended for potpourri or sachets should never be used in cooking.
It may have had perfume added to it. Fresh lavender at a florist
may also have been treated to make it nonedible.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the Greenmarkets are the best source for lavender,
and they are selling bunches for $1 to $3. Most recipes do not
require more than a few branches.
</P>
<P>
   Like cut flowers, fresh lavender is best kept in water. It
should be used within a day or it will begin to wilt. Any you
cannot use you can hang up in an airy spot to dry.
</P>
<P>
   Dried lavender should be added in somewhat smaller quantities
than fresh because it tends to be stronger. It is sold at spice
markets like Adriana's Caravan in the Grand Central Market and at
Aphrodisia in Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   For all its brilliant allure, lavender should add no more than
an elusive, fragrant ``je ne sais quoi.''  &QL;

READING THE FINE PRINT ON THAT FAT PIECE OF MEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just weeks ago, it seemed that meat and poultry
producers were finally going to have to provide the same nutrition
information on fresh cuts of meat that shoppers can find on a can
of peas or a box of crackers. President Clinton said so in a radio
address on May 27.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what the president said: ``This summer the federal
government will propose that packaged meat and poultry sold in
stores must come with nutrition labels. This is just plain common
sense. Shoppers value the fact that when they pick up a box of
cereal or a frozen meal, they can check the nutrition labels and
see how many calories or grams of saturated fat these foods
contain. That's the same kind of information that ought to be put
on every package of ground beef. Currently fewer than 60 percent of
retailers do so, because nutrition labeling of meat is voluntary.
It's time we make it mandatory.''
</P>
<P>
   That seemingly straightforward statement is anything but. It's
possible that the nutritional information will appear not on
packages but just at the meat counter.
</P>
<P>
   Nutrition labeling is mandatory for virtually every packaged
food, but not for meat and poultry, which is regulated by the
Department of Agriculture. All other foods are regulated by the
Food and Drug Administration, which since 1994 has required
nutrition labeling on packages.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department's regulations are voluntary and allow
stores to put nutrition information on placards or in brochures
near packages as long as at least 60 percent of the fresh meat is
labeled.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has spent time at a supermarket meat counter knows
that nutrition labeling is hard to find. Although pork and poultry
processors have started including nutrition information, beef
processors have not, and neither have supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Agriculture Department has indicated it does not plan to
force meat producers to put information on packages. In the Federal
Register of April 24, it said: ``The agency is proposing to require
that nutrition information be provided for these products either on
their label or at their point of purchase.''
</P>
<P>
   The department said last week that it would have no comment on
its tentative proposal. But it has obviously signaled what it
intends to do.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, ``We'd like to give the voluntary approach one more
try,'' said Sarah Lilygren of the American Meat Institute, a trade
association. After all, who wants to face the fact that an
eight-ounce porterhouse steak has 740 calories and 50 grams of fat?
</P>
<P>
   Karen Brown, a senior vice president of the Food Marketing
Institute, a supermarket trade association, said that she would
have no comment until a final proposal was issued. She noted that
some supermarkets, including Wegman's, a 58-store chain in upstate
New York, do label meat.
</P>
<P>
   That was news to Jane Andrews, a Wegman's spokeswoman. She said
the company favors labeling but labels only its ground meat because
it is difficult to provide accurate nutrition information on meat
cut at the stores.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Agriculture Department is expected to retain a
voluntary approach for most meat, it will make an exception for
ground meats, requiring that they carry nutrition labels. Labels
will still be able to say ``70 percent lean,'' ``80 percent lean,''
and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the Food and Drug Administration and the Agriculture
Department both ruled that a product could use the ``X percent
fat-free'' claim only if it was low fat (less than 10 percent) to
begin with. ``X percent fat-free'' and ``X percent lean'' are the
same.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, the Agriculture Department proposed a special
exemption allowing the ``percent lean'' claim even when the ground
meat was not low fat, as long as nutrition information was
available on the package or at the meat counter.
</P>
<P>
   There was heated opposition from health professionals, who
contended that such labeling confused and misled shoppers. But the
Agriculture Department is now proposing to make the loophole
permanent.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews said a combination of ``X percent lean'' and nutrition
information is exactly what consumers requested in focus groups,
adding, ``After we put the nutrition labeling and the `percent
lean' on the ground products, consumers changed what they bought
and started reducing fat.'' Labeling on the packages is preferable,
she said, because ``it's easier to read, and it's clear.'' &QL;

LACK OF TRADE DEAL UNDERSCORES FRAGILE NATURE OF CHINA-RUSSIAN
RELATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  By CRAIG S. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The presidents of China and Russia denounced the
United States' proposed missile defense program in a joint
statement Tuesday and vowed to strengthen a strategic partnership
between their nations.
</P>
<P>
   But the first day of their summit meeting produced no
substantive economic agreements, which Western scholars said
pointed to a fundamental flaw in that partnership. Trade ties are
more binding than talk in the post-Cold War era, and Russia cannot
compete with what the United States, Europe or Japan can offer
China these days, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese are the ultimate realists, and they know Russia is
now a third-rate country economically, technologically and
politically,'' said Michel Oksenberg, a China scholar at Stanford
University.
</P>
<P>
   China's president, Jiang Zemin, and Russia's president, Vladimir
Putin, met for nearly three hours Tuesday after a brief welcoming
ceremony at Beijing's Great Hall of the People on Tiananmen Square.
Jiang bantered with his guest in Russian, which he learned as a
student in Moscow when the Soviet Union played big brother to the
fledgling Chinese Communists.
</P>
<P>
   After the first session of the summit meeting, which ends on
Wednesday, the two leaders signed a joint statement condemning the
United States for seeking ``unilateral military and security
advantages'' with a missile defense plan that would violate the
1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. The statement warned that
breaching that treaty would ``trigger a new arms race.'' President
Clinton may decide by October whether to begin the first phase of
the system, or he may leave the decision to his successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our two countries presently share a common position on the
global security balance,'' Putin said after signing four other
documents, including accords on banking and energy cooperation and
an agreement for Russia to build an experimental fast-neutron
reactor in China. Jiang said that the two countries would ``push
forward a global multipolar process and establish a new political
and economic order.''
</P>
<P>
   But what was conspicuously missing from the list of documents
signed Tuesday was an agreement on building a multibillion-dollar
pipeline from Siberia to China. Some form of commitment on the
pipeline was expected to have been the largest, most concrete
development to come from Putin's visit.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of any agreement contrasts sharply with visits by
Western heads of state, who typically preside over the signing of
billions of dollars in their trade deals with China. Trade between
Russia and China totaled only $3.56 billion in the first half of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``To further boost trade ties, China and Russia need a big-scale
strategy and large projects,'' said Lu Nanquan, vice director of
the Russian Studies Center at China's Academy of Social Sciences in
Beijing. He said the pipeline deal was stalled over a dispute about
where it should go, with Russia favoring a route through Mongolia,
and China wanting the pipeline to pass farther north to its
refining center near the oil fields in Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the talk of partnership, analysts say that the two
countries are likely to remain wary of each other without more
cross-border investment and stronger trade flow. ``China can get
large investments and advanced technology only from the West,
particularly from the U.S., so there is only so far such a
Sino-Russian coalition can go,'' said Merle Goldman, a professor of
Chinese history at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is so far unwilling to help China in the one area that it
wants and for which Russia has the resources: the transfer of
weapons technology. Moscow has been reluctant to give China
sensitive know-how that could someday be used against it. Russia
prefers to sell China arms instead.
</P>
<P>
   And many people say Russia continues to regard China with
suspicion, given Russia's increasingly tenuous hold over its own
Far East. ``Russia is most concerned about the immigration of
Chinese into its Far East region, where only hundreds of thousands
of Russians live close to a Chinese region with a population of
hundreds of millions,'' said Zhao Huasheng, director of Russian
studies at the Shanghai Institute for International Studies.
``Russia fears that Chinese immigrants will outnumber Russian
citizens in the region, and might someday raise territorial
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Oksenberg, from Stanford University, said Beijing also
understands that too close a relationship with Russia could push
the United States into an even closer relationship with Japan,
which is something Beijing hopes to avoid. China wants to build
better ties with the world's industrialized powerhouses rather than
hitch itself to a weak economy like Russia's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beijing may seek to use Moscow opportunistically for a while,
but China's leaders now conceive of themselves as in the big
leagues, and behind their honeyed words, they view Russia with
scorn, disdain and pity,'' Oksenberg said.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Humidity waned across the northern Middle Atlantic States on
Tuesday in the wake of a cool front. Wednesday, newly arrived dry
air will encourage the development of rain as moist air arriving
from the south is forced to rise over dense dry air.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, areas of steady rain will dampen the region
stretching from the upper Ohio River Valley to Pennsylvania,
Maryland, northern Virginia, northern West Virginia, and southwest
and south-central New York. With rain falling into dry air,
temperatures will drop dramatically below seasonal levels. Rain
will spread east toward the Middle Atlantic coast.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, thunderstorms, some approaching severe levels,
will erupt over parts of southern Virginia, the southern Delmarva
Peninsula and North Carolina as a jet stream disturbance lifts
humid air.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: A CHILL FROM HEAT
</P>
<P>
   On Monday afternoon, 100-degree heat at Austin, Texas, set the
stage for record chill at night. By dawn Tuesday, readings had
fallen to 69 degrees, tying the record low for the date. During the
day Monday, intense heating of the very dry ground around Austin
caused blobs of hot air to rise several thousand feet above the
surface before warm air aloft (associated with a ridge of high
pressure) halted the ascent. In compensation, drier air sank to the
ground. With less water vapor near the surface, nighttime
temperatures fell to lower levels. &QL;

then, after a catnap, meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
five hours later. Informally, officials were suggesting that
Clinton's artificial deadline of 9 a.m. Wednesday, when he is

   ADOPTED-MONKEY (New York) _ The saga of Cookie Flikshtein has

Flikshtein family and an outraged army of their neighbors, Cookie
is a beloved _ albeit simian _ member of the family. She may be a
monkey, they admit, but she has adjusted enough to the human
condition to spend most evenings eating Rocky Road ice cream and
watching the nightly news. The state agrees that Cookie is no
ordinary primate, but not because of her human characteristics. She
is a Diana monkey, an endangered species. As such, she deserves
special care, and the state, after a protracted court battle, has
successfully argued that Cookie should be taken from the Flikshtein
home and placed in a special animal rescue program at the Detroit
Zoo. By Alan Feuer. With photos NYT5, 6.

systems that is the largest privately held collection of dams in
the world, is at stake under current plans for its pieces to be
auctioned off to the highest bidder by sometime next year. That

intended to ease the toll being inflicted on California's rivers.

HOT NEW GAMES FOR YOUR PC
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
 By MALCOLM MAYHEW
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the Next Generation video-game war raging among Sega
Dreamcast, Nintendo 64 and Sony PlayStation, the PC often gets
overlooked as an outlet for equally great vid-games. Here's a look
at four of the best new PC titles:
</P>
<P>
   Chicken Run Fun Pack (Activision, all ages): Two games, a screen
saver, a clock, a CD player and clips from the movie _ this thing's
packed with cool stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The first game, ``Run Chicken Run,'' is a direct lift from the
movie: Players must help the chicks escape from the barn before
they wind up Kentucky Fried. Problem is, the farmyard is scattered
with holes in which the chicks can get trapped. Players must find
boards, cover the holes and lead as many winged ones as possible to
safety before time runs out.
</P>
<P>
   The second game, ``Spring Chicken,'' picks up where the first
one left off. Now that the chicks have escaped from the barn,
players must launch them _ via a trampoline _ over a fence to
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Dark Reign 2 (Activision, ages 13 and up): Yes, it's another
run-and-shoot futuristic action game, but it's a good one.
</P>
<P>
   This one's a cut above the rest because players have so many
options: They can play as one of two teams (the rich guys or the
ragtag outfit) or corral a bunch of friends for the dizzying
multiplayer mode.
</P>
<P>
   There doesn't seem to be much of an object here, just blow up
your opponents and capture their areas. It's pleasingly simple in
other ways, too, from the easy-to-learn controls to the
understandable, and exquisitely detailed, playing fields. The
characters look pretty cool, kind of a cross between the guys in
Dune and Blade Runner.
</P>
<P>
   Parents beware: There's a lot of blood and violence, hence the
13 and up rating.
</P>
<P>
   The Settlers III: Ultimate Collection (Blue Byte, all ages): To
hype its upcoming The Settlers IV, Blue Byte has repackaged the
third game in its empire-building/defending/destroying series with
bonus games. The object remains the same, though: Choose an empire,
from Egyptian, Roman and Asian, build it up from scratch, then wipe
out the empires. The bonus CDs include new maps, warriors,
buildings and missions.
</P>
<P>
   Pajama Sam's One-Stop Fun Shop (Humongous Entertainment, ages
3-8): Man, Pajama Sam's got more games than Mario. The latest title
hosted by the green critter is designed to get young ones
interested in art. Using virtual art tools, kids can create and
color their own pictures and storybooks. Best of all, there's no
mess to clean up.

MIKAILA AIMS TO BREAK THE BLOND TEEN POP-STAR MOLD 
 (ACCOMPANIES POPMUSIC-FERMAN-COLUMN)

   Jeff Fenster knows talent _ or at least a dollar sign _ when he
sees it.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based talent scout and executive vice president of
A&AMP;R (artist and repertoire) for the Island/Def Jam label is the man
responsible for signing teen-pop unstoppables Backstreet Boys and
Britney Spears to Jive Records, where he used to work.
</P>
<P>
   Since he joined Island/Def Jam a year ago, he has signed only
one artist, but he insists she's going to be a big one: Mikaila
Enriquez, a 13-year-old singer from North Richland Hills, Texas, a
Fort Worth suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Island/Def Jam is poising Mikaila _ who, trendily, goes by her
first name only (it's pronounced Mah-KAY-la) _ for major success by
giving her the opening slot on Spears' current tour (which rolls
into Smirnoff Music Centre in Dallas on Wednesday night), sending
her across the country to pop radio stations for interviews and
spending a ton of time, energy and money on her self-titled debut,
which is set to come out January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   It's something she's been preparing for all of her young life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been singing since I was 3, since I could talk,'' Mikaila
said, calling from a hotel room in New York, where she's been
rehearsing for her tour with Britney. ``Wherever, family reunions,
school, church.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, with Britney, stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're gonna do the same thing that we did with Britney,''
Fenster said. ``We're gonna put her out there and keep her out
there. This isn't something you do with every artist, but when it's
someone this special, you kind of want to let the world know that
you're coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Mikaila is the latest in a long line of attractive, post-Britney
teen female singers to be groomed for the pop-music spotlight _ and
the third from Texas, right behind Jessica Simpson from Plano and
Angela Via from San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   What makes her different is her age. At 13, Mikaila is the
youngest pop singer to get a major label deal. But in spite of the
music industry's current Lolita-like love affair with blond teen
girls _ as well as the arrival of Billy Gilman, the much-touted,
12-year-old male country singer _ Fenster surely must fear that
Mikaila's age will handicap her in an industry known for its
cutthroat competition, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the answer is `no,' '' Fenster says. ``It's an old
cliche, but from our standpoint, age ain't nothing but a number.
Besides, she's a teen artist and her initial audience will be
teens. She is a member of who her audience is. That's where they
start, with their peers. If they're the real deal, they grow and
appeal to an even broader audience.''
</P>
<P>
   To Mikaila's credit, she hardly seems like a 13-year-old.
Makeup, platform shoes and sexy clothing at least superficially
bump up her maturity a few years, but it's not just her looks that
belie her age. She is quick-witted and sagacious far beyond her
years.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if she feels like the label is looking to cash in on
the cute-girl trend rather than her talent, she answers astutely.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're always going to be looking at the money side,'' she
says, ``But they haven't forced me to do anything I haven't wanted
to do. That's why I went with them. A lot of new artists get pushed
in directions they don't want to go, or get lost among other
artists on that label. It's sad.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of Edmond, Okla., Mikaila moved to North Texas with her
family when she was 9. There, she attended Spring Garden Elementary
School in Bedford; she had already been singing for six years.
</P>
<P>
   Mikaila's family eventually took her musical aspirations
seriously and helped her build a career, enrolling her in vocal and
dance classes. Singing in churches led to singing at sporting
events. Sporting events led to lawyers' offices. Finally, the
family hired entertainment attorney Larry Rudolph, who just so
happened to be Britney Spears' manager.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Mikaila says, the phone would not stop ringing.
``We went to New York and, in one day, visited five different
record labels,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   After signing with Island/Def Jam, Mikaila began work on her
self-titled debut.
</P>
<P>
   And it will be this album, Mikaila says, that will make her
stand apart from all the other teen singers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My music is a lot different than everyone else's,'' she says.
``It has more of an R&AMP;B flavor to it. It's not the usual thing you
hear on the radio. Plus, I know I'm gonna stand out 'cause I have
brown hair.''

BRITNEY MANIA: AT 18, SHE'S ON TOP OF THE WORLD 
 (ACCOMPANIED BY BC-MIKAILA-TEX)
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's Britney Spears' world _ we just live in it, buy the CDs,
and circulate the hot rumors.
</P>
<P>
   At 18, Spears is a small-town girl who made good _ incredibly
good. In the past two years she has sold more than 16 million CDs
and become the reigning queen of all young female singers with bare
midriffs.
</P>
<P>
   She's accomplished all this in large part because of her looks
and her persona _ just-slightly-naughty nice girl _ and a sound
that's a squeaky clean version of modern R&AMP;B, topped by her squeaky
clean voice.
</P>
<P>
   Britney is back in Fort Worth-Dallas at 7:30 CDT Wednesday
night, when she'll play the Smirnoff Music Centre in Dallas. She is
touring to support her second CD, ``Oops!... I Did It Again,''
which has sold more than 4 million copies in only six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Here, then, is the latest about Britney:
</P>
<P>
   Britney museum &QC;
</P>
<P>
   People at the Kentwood Museum in Kentwood, La., _ Britney's
hometown _ are going to devote one room of the museum to
memorabilia of Britney's career. The museum currently features
antiques and an exhibit about local veterans, from World War II to
Desert Storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're planning on having platinum records and dolls and
clothes and the necklace she wore in the Mardi Gras parade,'' says
museum employee Hazel Morris. ``We don't have things from her
family here yet, but it's been promised.''
</P>
<P>
   Will there be a specific theme? ``No, it's just Britney,''
Morris said. ``You don't need a theme. We're planning on this being
open next year _ I think she'll be here at the opening. That's the
impression I have.''
</P>
<P>
   But Morris added that there is nothing to see yet. ``I have
people calling and dropping in and I'm tellin' you, I have so many
disappointed people,'' she said. ``All I can show them now are
photos of her grandfathers in the military exhibit. You'd be
surprised how many people want to see those.''
</P>
<P>
   Britney vs. Christina &QC;
</P>
<P>
   There is definitely competition between Britney and Christina
Aguilera for the honor of Most Popular Blond Teen Singer.
</P>
<P>
   Britney has sold 16 million CDs to Christina's 6 million,
although Britney has made two CDs, Christina just one.
</P>
<P>
   Both have made the cover of ``Rolling Stone:'' Britney in a
red-white-and-blue top and red pants, Christina in a tank top,
jeans, and a bikini bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Britney has been the grand marshal of New Orleans' Mardi Gras
Parade.
</P>
<P>
   Christina beat Britney for the Best New Artist Grammy this past
February.
</P>
<P>
   Britney has hosted ``Saturday Night Live'' (and was actually
pretty funny).
</P>
<P>
   Britney has become part of Cockney slang: A ``Britney Spears''
now means ``beer'' in various bars in England.
</P>
<P>
   Christina is the better singer.
</P>
<P>
   Britney factoids &QC;
</P>
<P>
   She performed in talent shows as a child; during the summer, she
would head to New York to study at the off-Broadway Dance Center
and the Professional Performing Arts School.
</P>
<P>
   When she was only 10, she appeared off-Broadway in ``Ruthless''
_ inspired by the movie ``The Bad Seed.''
</P>
<P>
   She was a part of ``The Mickey Mouse Club Show'' for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Her rise to popularity began with mall tours with 'N Sync.
</P>
<P>
   With the success of ``Baby, One More Time,'' she became the
youngest performer ever to hit the top of the charts with a single
and an album.
</P>
<P>
   She recently purchased, for seven figures, a mansion and estate
in England.
</P>
<P>
   Her record company has vigorously denied reports in the British
tabloids that Britney and 'N Sync's Justin Timberlake were either
engaged or had been secretly married.

 &HT;    Odds are nearly 2-1 Woods will win British Open on Woods
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland - It will take a serious wager to make
substantial money on Tiger Woods here this week.
</P>
<P>
   On the brick-hard fairways of the Old Course, his odds for the
129th British Open resemble those usually associated with
thoroughbreds.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Tuesday about the lopsided 2-1 favorite's role, Woods
corrected to the right odds, 15-8. Then he discouraged people from
betting. ``Well, maybe five quid here and there,'' Woods said. ``I
probably wouldn't put any more than that. It's bad odds.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not. When you win a U.S. Open by 15 shots, anything is
possible. Add his 15-stroke victory at the U.S. Open to his 12-shot
victory in the 1997 Masters, and the pressure shifts to those being
embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   Woods seems comfortable as the favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you, it is nice to have an opportunity to
complete the (career) slam at St. Andrews,'' he said, ``but, then
again, if my career goes as long as I hope it will go, I think I
might have a few more opportunities. And that's something you have
to keep in the back of your mind. I know one thing. When it's time
to play on Thursday, I couldn't care less about the slam.''
</P>
<P>
   He played the Old Course about 7 a.m. Tuesday with Mark
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara and Mark Calcavecchia. He was wearing his black
ensemble, including a turtleneck to fight the morning cool. With
his mother, Tida, following the group, Woods hit tee shots and lies
in several bunkers, trying to gather new information about the Old
Course, which can differ by the moment. He has played at St.
Andrews twice, as an amateur in 1995 and in the Dunhill Cup two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   His length off the tee is expected to serve him well. Depending
on weather conditions, O'Meara said, Woods could drive as many as
eight of the par-4s; seven are under 400 yards. The ball is running
so fast on the fairways that all of the long hitters should have
opportunities for eagles.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Woods spoke about a bunker downwind on the 464-yard
4th hole, about 350 yards from the tee. He was 15 yards short of
the bunker on Tuesday with a poorly hit 3-wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the wind blows,'' Woods said, ``you can see guys hitting
the ball over 400, no problem. That won't be hard to do. . . . I'm
not the only one saying this, but it's weird to have the fairways
faster than the greens.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Faldo envisions 450-yard bombs from Woods. Lee Trevino, who
knows something about getting maximum yardage from low-trajectory
shots in a British Open, figures at least six par-4s are driveable
by Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to make some mistakes trying to hit it so far,''
Trevino said, ``but I'll tell you, he's going to make a lot of
birdies, too.''
</P>
<P>
   He could be in line to break the Open Championship record of
18-under, set by Faldo in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've watched those tapes (of 1990), and the pins were not
tucked,'' Tiger said. ``They were toward the middle of the greens,
because they were protecting against the big wind. . . . If you
looked at the scores in '90, it wasn't just Nick. He only won by
four. There were other guys on 14-under. . . . The pins were
accessible, and the golf course was to be had.''
</P>
<P>
   Masters champion Vijay Singh has suggested that players who
concern themselves too much with what Woods is doing this week
``are already in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods said he doubts that many players will be that poorly
focused. ``They need to take care of their own business,'' he said.
``I'm going to try and take care of mine, so I can be there Sunday
with a chance to win.''

 &HT;    DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE: Mr. Poppy trimmed your hair while
filling your head with stories
 &HT;    (''Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share with Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By David C. Keller
 &HT;    c. 2000 Special to Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Sunday morning, it was St. John's Lutheran Church.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday and Saturday nights, it was one of the five taverns in
town or the American Legion Hall.
</P>
<P>
   But on Saturday morning the gathering place of society in Union,
Ill., a small farm town of 300, was Mr. Poppy's barbershop.
</P>
<P>
   When we first moved to town, Mr. Poppy had a regular shop with
three chairs in a converted garage and a little gas heater that
barely kept the shop warm in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time he ``retired'' at the age of 85, he had grown
tired of keeping up such a big place and moved his shop into his
home.
</P>
<P>
   His living room was the waiting room, and he set up his barber
chair and equipment in the dining room. A tiny kitchen and bedroom
made up the rest of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Before coming to Union, our haircuts were generally given by my
mom in our basement. But, now my dad decided my brothers and I were
old enough to go to a regular barber.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Poppy charged 25 cents for a haircut, which was a bargain
even for the early '60s. He said he didn't want to make too much
money or his Social Security would be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Dad would always give us $1, though, and told us we'd better not
bring back any change. Mr. Poppy would often protest that it was
just too much of a tip for a 25-cent haircut.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Poppy never seemed to be in a hurry even if half a dozen
shaggy farmers filled his tiny waiting area. He would cut a little,
then stop and talk for a few minutes, then cut a little more. As a
result, a haircut usually took an hour to complete.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Poppy had only one kind of haircut -- short on top and no
sideburns. This was definitely not a cool haircut for a teenager of
that era.
</P>
<P>
   But the main reason most people went to Mr. Poppy's shop was for
the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Poppy was a fount of information about Union and its
citizens, having lived there his entire 89 years and barbered its
residents for most of that time.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but his lady friend was the postmistress of Union
and knew everything about everybody, which she gladly passed along
to him:
</P>
<P>
   Art Moellering bought that 80 acres out on River Road and
intended to put in soybeans ... Some new people from Chicago
acquired the old Wayne place ... The Baumans just got a load of sod
delivered to their house ...
</P>
<P>
   The one topic that both young and old enjoyed most was
reminiscing.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Poppy would hold us spellbound with accounts of how Union
was the last town east of the Mississippi to go dry before
Prohibition and how trainloads of drinkers would travel to Union
from Chicago to fill their jugs with whiskey.
</P>
<P>
   I always came away from Mr. Poppy's barbershop with my head
shorn of its sideburns but filled with wonderful stories.

 &HT;    Gephardt says he doesn't want to be Gore's running mate
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt says he doesn't want to be
Al Gore's running mate this fall _ but he wouldn't rule out
accepting the second slot. Democratic officials have said in recent
days that Gephardt was one of several potential running mates on
Gore's list. But Gephardt says he expects to be busy helping the
party recapture Congress. ``I think I've been clear; I don't know
how you can be more clear,'' the Missourian said in his first
public comments since word surfaced that he and Gore held an
unannounced meeting recently. ABC News quoted a Gephardt adviser as
saying it is ``very, very unlikely'' that Gephardt will be on the
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   A PUSH FOR VICTIMS' RIGHTS
</P>
<P>
   Criticized for halfhearted support of a victims' rights
resolution in the Senate, Al Gore wrapped the proposed
constitutional amendment into his presidential campaign with an
appearance in Memphis today at the side of crime victims. Gore
listened _ nodding and ``mmm-hmmm-ing'' sympathetically _ as seven
victims told their stories. One told of having her rapist watch her
as she testified at his parole hearing. Another _ held hostage and
raped repeatedly for five days by three men _ pleaded to be
notified when they're paroled. Gore promised that, under his
proposed amendment, there would be victim notification of paroles
or escapes.
</P>
<P>
   ON TIPTOES IN ILLINOIS
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush went to Illinois Tuesday in an attempt to strike
a delicate balance between winning votes in a key battleground
state and aligning himself too closely with a politically
beleaguered governor who chairs his state campaign. Bush's first
visit to Illinois came amid concerns in his camp over Gov. George
Ryan. Asked recently in jest whether Ryan, who has imposed a
moratorium on the death penalty in Illinois, was ever on the list
to be considered as a potential running mate, ``Oh pleeease,'' Bush
responded, his mouth turning into a grin.
</P>
<P>
   CAROLINE KENNEDY ON THE BILL
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Kennedy, the only surviving member of the slain
president's immediate family, will address the Democratic
convention. Mark Fabiani said the time and topic have not been
decided. Caroline's brother, John F. Kennedy Jr., addressed the
convention in 1988 to wild cheers as he recounted the legacy of his
father and introduced his uncle, Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy.
Caroline Kennedy has been careful about her turns in the political
spotlight. In 1992, she declined to serve as Democratic convention
chairwoman.
</P>
<P>
   AS QUICK AS YOU CAN SAY JACK ROBINSON
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts' highest court ruled that Republican Jack E.
Robinson gathered enough valid voter signatures and should be
allowed to make his long shot challenge of Sen. Edward Kennedy.
``We won,'' said Robinson, who was disavowed by his own party after
embarrassing details about his past were revealed. The State Ballot
Law Commission had ruled in favor of challenges to 129 signatures
by the secretary of state's office and the state Democratic Party,
making him 14 signatures shy of the 10,000 needed. Today's court
decision overturned that ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ANY TIME LEFT FOR COMMERCIALS?
</P>
<P>
   CBS, which had considered cutting back prime-time coverage of
the two conventions to just two nights, now says it will have at
least some live coverage on all four nights of each gathering. ABC
also changed its plans, adding an hour of coverage on the first
night of both conventions. The expanded coverage assures that
President Clinton's speech will be broadcast live on the two
networks. The extra hour for the Republicans will help equalize
coverage and allow the showing of retired Gen. Colin Powell's
speech.
</P>
<P>
   SOME SHRINKAGE IN THE POLLS
</P>
<P>
   Three new polls indicate that George W. Bush's lead over Al Gore
is narrowing. A CBS News survey (4 percentage point margin of
error) shows Bush leading Gore 43-41 percent, down from his 47-39
edge in May. A Zogby poll (3 percentage point error margin) has
Bush holding a 45-41percent lead, compared to a 47-39 edge a month
ago. And a USA Today/CNN Gallup poll (4 percentage point error
margin) has Bush leading Gore 45-43 percent, compared to 50-to-41 a
week ago.
</P>
<P>
   RECORDS ARE MADE TO BE BROKEN
</P>
<P>
   It's only July and already the hard-fought congressional contest
in the Los Angeles suburbs between Rep. James Rogan (R-Calif.) and
Democratic state Sen. Adam Schiff is on the verge of becoming the
most expensive House race in American history. With about $7.5
million raised so far, they seem certain to surpass the $8 million
record set in Georgia in the 1996 contest between then-Speaker Newt
Gingrich and his Democratic challenger, Michael Coles. Rogan was
one of the House impeachment managers in the case against President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   GOOD SHOT IN THE ARM NEEDED
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic National Committee warning that traveling in Texas
may be hazardous to your health _ intended as a slap at George W.
Bush _ brought a stern warning from a Houston health official about
injecting politics into public safety. ``Public health is too
serious an issue to politicize, especially the health of our
children,'' said Kathy Barton of the Houston health department. The
nation's fourth largest city, according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, is ripe for an epidemic because only 67
percent of its children are vaccinated.
</P>
<P>
   DON'T TREAD ON THEIR STATE
</P>
<P>
   A group headed by a Texas magazine publisher says it'll work to
ensure the state is treated fairly as its Republican governor runs
for the presidency. The Proud of Texas Committee was formed by
Texas Monthly publisher Michael Levy. Members include Democratic
State Board of Education member Will Davis, Texas Tech University
Health Sciences Center president David Smith and ex-state Rep. Mark
Stiles, a Democrat from Beaumont. All four have contributed to
George W. Bush's campaign. Texas Democratic Chair Molly Beth
Malcolm said that's proof the group is not independent.
</P>
<P>
   LOOK OUT AL, HERE COMES NADER
</P>
<P>
   The Green Party is striking some fear into the hearts of
Michigan Democrats by pushing to get Ralph Nader onto Michigan's
ballot. By Thursday's deadline, Green Party supporters plan to turn
in more than 50,000 petition signatures. At least 30,272 signatures
must be valid for the party to qualify for the November ballot.
``The ones that sign ... are just so happy to have a viable
alternative'' to Bush and Gore, said the Geen Party's Craig Harvey.
A recent statewide poll showed Nader taking votes away from Al
Gore.

   SUING FOR SPOT AT DEBATES
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party presidential hopeful Pat Buchanan's campaign said
today he'll soon file suit against the commission organizing
presidential candidate debates to be included in the contests.
Buchanan, running for the Reform Party nomination against nuclear
physicist John Hagelin, petitioned the Federal Election Commission
for inclusion in the debates. A 20-day period for the FEC to take
action was to expire today, apparently without any response.

<P>
   CYBERTRAIL OF CAMPAIGN DONATIONS
</P>
<P>
   It's now much easier for Texans, or anyone else, to follow the
money. Starting today, political campaign finance reports filed
electronically with the Texas Ethics Commission were going posted
on the Internet (www.ethics.state.tx.us), making them more widely
available. Texas joined a group of about 20 states that mandate
electronic disclosure of contributions and expenses by candidates
and lawmakers. Watchdog groups hailed the online database's debut
as a victory for open government.

   PROTESTERS AS SUPERHEROS
</P>
<P>
   The Berkeley-based Ruckus Society is hosting a training camp
this week to teach activists elaborate civil disobedience tactics
for the demonstrations planned outside the Aug. 14-17 convention in
downtown Los Angeles. Atop the Santa Monica Mountains, about 150
activists are learning how to be like Superman. They're practicing
ways to scale tall buildings to hang massive protest banners,
linking arms to form nearly unbreakable human blockades, and
learning how to move faster than a speeding tear gas canister.
</P>
<P>
   PROTESTERS AS PUPPETS
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators at the Republican convention in Philadelphia will
perform impromptu street theater as colorful political puppets
while wearing papier-mache masks of Uncle Sam or ``corporate fat
cats.'' Some of the most elaborate puppets will appear in the Unity
2000 march, expected to draw up to 20,000 demonstrators on July 30
the day before the convention opens. Dozens of activists plan to
dress up as rats, cockroaches and ants in a ``Parade of
Pestilence'' on July 31 _ representing ``dirty government.''

<P>
   HISPANIC NEPHEW OUT THERE STUMPING
</P>
<P>
   George Prescott Bush, son of Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and his
Mexican-born wife, Columba, was in Atlanta speaking at the Plaza La
Fiesta, a Latino marketplace, before attending a reception with
young professionals at a swank Buckhead-area jazz club. A day
earlier Bush, who will enter the University of Texas Law School
next month, spoke to the Young Hispanic Republican Association in
Arlingon, Va. He said his uncle is working to appeal to Hispanic
and other minority voters who have historically been written off as
sure votes for Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   OLD RIVAL GOES TO BAT FOR BAUER
</P>
<P>
   ``It's payback time for Sen. John McCain,'' the National Journal
reports. No, he hasn't set out to settle an old score. Rather, he's
asking about 80,000 of his contributors to send checks to a former
rival for the Republican nomination, conservative activist Gary
Bauer, to help him retire his campaign debt. The publication said
that McCain, in a letter to mail donors (not the thousands who gave
through the Internet), noted that Bauer was ``willing to put his
neck on the line for us'' when he endorsed McCain's candidacy after
withdrawing from the race.
</P>
<P>
   CAN YOU KEEP THE NAMES STRAIGHT?
</P>
<P>
   K.B. Forbes rejoined Pat Buchanan, becoming a spokesman for his
campaign after a stint representing unsuccessful Republican
candidate Steve Forbes. K.B. Forbes was Buchanan's deputy press
secretary in 1996 and a regional press secretary based in
California in 1992. Then he became Steve Forbes' traveling press
secretary. In his new role, K.B. Forbes will be Buchanan's
communications director. The Forbeses are not related, and K.B.
says he remains a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   A LOT MORE WHERE THAT CAME FROM
</P>
<P>
   Jon Corzine, who spent a record $36.7 million to win the
Democratic primary in New Jersey for U.S. Senate, filed to sell $41
million worth of stock in Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., which he once
headed. A campaign spokesman said Corzine wanted to diversify his
investment portfolio.The candidate has lent his campaign $33
million so far. The stock sale is expected to take place in a
public offering in about two weeks. Corzine will still own about 4
million shares of Goldman Sachs, worth about $400 million at
current value of about $1000 a share.

You can try out the recipes and cast your vote by sending a

   NOW WIFE'S TURN TO TAKE THE STAGE
</P>
<P>
   Donna Hanover, who pulled out of a turn in ``The Vagina
Monologues'' after estranged hubby Rudy Giuliani was diagnosed with
prostate cancer and quit the New York Senate race, has signed on
for a stint running from Oct.10-Nov. 5. Hanover will be one of the
three female stars who read the monologues, which involve
everything from rape in Bosnia to sex on Long Island. Hanover: ``
Personal and family considerations make this fall a better time
than the previous dates.''

NEW WINDOWS E-MAIL SECURITY BREACH DISCOVERED, PROFESSOR SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A Boston University faculty member is warning of new
security bugs in Microsoft Corp. software that could allow a vandal
to sabotage computers by sending electronic mail messages. Unlike
earlier e-mail attacks, this new attack method doesn't rely on
infected e-mail attachments. Instead, the e-mail itself bears the
infection, and can transmit it with no warning.
</P>
<P>
   Jesper Johansson, an assistant professor at the university's
school of management, calls the new security lapse ``one of the
most serious exploits (security holes) of Windows workstations in
the last several years.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Johansson learned of the problem several weeks ago from
Georgi Guninski, a Bulgarian computer expert who specializes in
identifying bugs in Windows security. Johansson decided not to
publicize the problem immediately because doing so would have made
it easy for computer vandals to launch attacks against
Microsoft-based computers.
</P>
<P>
   Johannson, who edits the respected SANS Windows Security Digest,
decided to wait until Microsoft's engineers had come up with a way
to solve the problem. That happened late last week, and Johannson
on Monday published a warning on the SANS Web site, urging
Microsoft users to quickly patch their systems.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Microsoft-based computers were infected by the
``Love Bug'' e-mail virus earlier this year. But that virus
required the user to open an infected file attached to the e-mail.
In this new attack, a computer can be sabotaged by sending an
e-mail written in the HTML format used to create Web pages. HTML
messages can include embedded software written in ``scripting
languages'' such as Microsoft's Visual Basic for Applications.
Opening the e-mail will activate a browser, which will run the
embedded program.
</P>
<P>
   But with many common e-mail programs, such as Eudora and
Microsoft Outlook, it's not even necessary to open the message. The
e-mail program does it automatically in a ``preview pane,'' so it
can be read without opening it. But just previewing an HTML mail
message is enough to activate the software embedded inside.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has long known about the possibility of this sort of
attack, and has built in precautions against it. But Guninski
discovered a couple of unsuspected security holes. He found that it
was possible to write HTML e-mail that would tell the recipient
computer to go to a particular Web address and download a file
there. This file, written with Microsoft's Access database program,
could contain code that could do something unpleasant, like wiping
out the data on the infected computer.
</P>
<P>
   Then Guninski found that he could send a second HTML e-mail
message that would activate the malicious code contained in the
database. In effect, he'd stumbled across a two-step process for
sabotaging computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you surfed to a malicious user's Web site, this would allow
them to run code on your machine,'' said Microsoft security product
manager Scott Culp.
</P>
<P>
   Guninski, in an e-mail from Bulgaria, put the matter even more
bluntly: ``The problems are very serious _ they may allow a
malicious person to take full control over user's computer,'' he
said. ``Definitely the bugs SANS are writing about are one of the
worst Windows security holes ever.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that any computer has yet been attacked in
this way, and both SANS and Microsoft are urging users to move
quickly to keep it that way.
</P>
<P>
   The problem affects users of Microsoft Access, Excel and
PowerPoint, as well as the Internet Explorer browser and any e-mail
program that displays HTML e-mail, such as Outlook or Eudora.
Software patches and other information about ways to fix the
problem can be found at www.sans.org or at
www.microsoft.com/technet/security.

DRUG INDUSTRY LIKELY TO REMAIN UNDER FIRE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite churning out effective medicines in recent years, the
bitter debate over a prescription-drug benefit for seniors and the
cost of AIDS drugs in poor countries has turned the nation's
pharmaceutical industry into a high-profile whipping boy.
</P>
<P>
   To an extent, the heated rhetoric labeling drug makers as price
gougers and profiteers reflects election-year politics. Vice
President Al Gore is the most visible example, accusing the
``powerful'' industry of ``special-interest schemes'' to keep
prices high.
</P>
<P>
   But a growing number of politicians, consumer advocates and
health-care experts say the harsh statements reflect a growing
distrust that may keep pharmaceutical companies on the defensive
well beyond the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``This industry is in a tough situation. It's very clear it's
not well liked. The challenge is to remain competitive without
alienating consumers,'' said Laura Ries, a corporate-image
consultant. ``But there's no easy answer and so the problem isn't
going to go away.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time drug makers have been lambasted. They
were vilified during the Clinton administration's failure to
overhaul the health care system in 1994. And AIDS activists have
regularly heckled and picketed pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
   As drug makers see it, they're misunderstood. They argue
research funding, which climbed from $15.2 billion in 1995 to $26.4
billion last year, would be hurt by some proposals for making drugs
more affordable here and abroad. And while they have a duty to
patients, they say, they also have a responsibility to
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the industry needs to be relentlessly and continuously
positive and open about the benefits our medicines provide,'' said
Alan Holmer, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America, the industry's trade group. ``I know it
sounds Pollyanish, but this is what we'll do and, principally, all
we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, prices for prescription drugs continue to rise.
Last year, the average cost of a prescription drug jumped 9.6
percent, according to Express Scripts Inc., a pharmacy benefits
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Another study by Families USA, a health-care advocacy group,
found the average cost of the 50 drugs most used by the elderly --
one-third of whom lack drug coverage -- rose almost 4 percent last
year, outpacing the 2.2 percent inflation rate. At the same time,
consumer advocates have pointed to drastically lower drug prices in
Canada and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the industry is spending billions of dollars
promoting new and expensive pills for impotence, dieting and
baldness -- life-style, not life-saving medicines.
</P>
<P>
   According to IMS Health, a market researcher, industry
promotional spending rose 11 percent in 1999 to $13.9 billion. This
included $1.8 billion for direct advertisements to consumers, a 40
percent increase from 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Drug makers also have come under attack for trying to block poor
African governments from allowing local companies to make cheaper
generic versions of expensive AIDS drugs or even import them from
Brazil or India where U.S. patents aren't protected. And plans by
some drug makers to offer steep discounts has prompted cries for
price reductions in this country.
</P>
<P>
   All of this has occurred as the drug industry has consistently
racked up impressive profits -- year-to-year earnings growth
reported by most drug makers has regularly exceeded 10 percent.
Some companies recorded earnings gains above 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the heavy promotional spending, expensive lobbying
battles over AIDS drugs and the Medicare drug benefit, and
legislative efforts to extend patents on big-selling drugs convey
the sense that the companies put profits ahead of patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through it all, the drug industry keeps saying they're
interested in public health,'' said Larry Sasich of Public Citizen,
a consumer advocacy group. ``But they're really just a business
like any other.''
</P>
<P>
   Public Citizen this month issued a report criticizing the
industry for spending $236 million to lobby Washington between 1997
and 1999, and giving an estimated $13.8 million in political
contributions for the 2000 election year cycle to influence
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Drug makers respond that they have a right to make their
positions heard and argue that rising prices reflect the rapidly
increasing cost of developing each new medicine, a figure that now
stands at about $500 million. They say such outlays require them to
develop and aggressively promote any drug that will provide high
returns and attract investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pharmaceutical companies are not philanthropic
organizations,'' said Ralph Larsen, chief executive at Johnson &AMP;
Johnson in New Brunswick, N.J. ``Yes, we have to find a way to make
drugs more affordable for people who can't afford them. But if
companies went out and slashed prices for everything, research
would dry up. And like it or not, this is expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, pharmaceutical companies maintain the White
House's Medicare proposal -- which relies on government, not
private insurers, to administer a drug benefit to seniors -- would
lead to price controls, stifling revenue needed to pay for
research. They prefer a Republican plan that relies on a federally
subsidized drug benefit provided by the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Republican pollster Whit Ayres said the attacks on the industry
by Gore and the Democrats represent a predictable ploy to appeal to
seniors and bolster its chances in the fall elections, rather than
work with the GOP to pass legislation in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is having difficulty consolidating the Democratic base
behind his candidacy and whenever that happens, Democrats start
engaging in anti-rich, anti-business class warfare to gin up the
troops,'' said Ayres.
</P>
<P>
   But some observers say the industry has gone overboard and
created some of its own problems, pointing to an organization
called Citizens for Better Medicare. Ron Pollack, director of
Families USA, called the organization a ``deceptive'' front
operation for the drug industry that has spent more than $30
million on advertising to oppose the Democrats' Medicare plan.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Ryan, who heads Citizens for Better Medicare, complained his
group has been ``demonized,'' and said it is fighting for
comprehensive Medicare reform that includes a drug benefit free of
government price controls.

SPEEDY FAIRWAYS MAKING BRITISH OPEN FIELD CAUTIOUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ Christy O'Connor Jr. would be next on
the first tee, so as he waited for Tom Lehman and Duffy Waldorf to
hit, there was time for some practice putting.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Connor wasn't on the practice green; he was right there on
a portion of the first tee, rolling putts toward the six holes that
had been cut. Mike Weir, who would tee off after O'Connor, was
doing the same thing, and you couldn't find a player in the field
of 156 who would tell you it didn't make sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greens are running 10 on the stimp, the fairways 12,''
said Lehman, whose view is universally shared by his colleagues
here for the 129th British Open at historic St. Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   Firm and fast? How about firmest and fastest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is weird to have the fairways faster than the greens,''
said Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to be very, very fast,'' said Jack Nicklaus.
``They have cut the fairways to nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is seriously dry,'' said Nick Faldo. ``It is a different
style of golf. You have to really start thinking bump and run. The
fairways are very tight.''
</P>
<P>
   Fairways? How about runways?
</P>
<P>
   It is generally believed that Woods has the ability to drive at
least four of the par-4s here, but over the last two days, when
conditions were out of the ordinary for this cherished venue _ that
is, warm and windless _ great length was not limited to Woods.
There is, after all, the presence of John Daly, who reportedly
drove the 412-yard sixth hole.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, that would open eyes, but already this week there have
been so many stories of golf balls rolling wild distances that
nothing is hard to believe.
</P>
<P>
   There was Jeff Sluman, tossing balls on the practice range only
to see them roll a hundred yards.
</P>
<P>
   There was Fred Couples driving on the closing hole, his ball
rolling through the Valley of Sin, up and through the green, and
out-of-bounds on a hole that measures 357 yards.
</P>
<P>
   There was Colin Montgomerie reaching the 312-yard 12th hole, and
Woods doing likewise, with a ``cut driver back into the wind,'' no
less.
</P>
<P>
   There were Darren Clarke and Paul McGinley having easy
approaches into the usually-feared Road Hole, the demanding par-4
17th that measures 455 yards.
</P>
<P>
   And there was Woods, of all people, acting amazed at how far he
had hit a shot. It was at the 464-yard fourth hole, a drive down
the left side with the wind ``coming down off the right.'' He
pulled it slightly, but it stayed in the fairway and rolled and
rolled and rolled. Nice, said Woods, ``but it was only 15 yards
away from a huge bunker that only comes into play downwind right to
left.''
</P>
<P>
   The bunkers at St. Andrews are to be avoided at all cost, but
with the ground so hard, Woods now knows the bunker on No. 4 _ even
if it is 350 yards away _ is within range for him, and not just
with the wind at his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of neat to pick up new little things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Players, said Faldo, best pick up a lot of new little tricks if
they are to navigate their way around St. Andrews this week,
because unless conditions change dramatically, they won't be flying
their wedges and 9-irons at pins and making them stop on a dime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite often, the shot is just feel,'' said Faldo, who was 18
under when he won the British Open here in 1990, a week when
conditions were somewhat similar. ``There is a lot of putting from
around the greens, short of the greens, off the greens, that sort
of thing. Very much along the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   That has players scrambling to figure out which 14 clubs to put
into their bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the guys are talking about changing some of their
wedges,'' said Woods. ``They want to try and go for a little less
bounce, get the blade underneath the ball for a bit. You have to
tinker with things.''
</P>
<P>
   The added distance, said Woods, is not necessarily a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the fairways being as fast as they are,'' he said, ``you
need to position your golf ball off the tee because the ball will
run, and if you keep it on the left too much, there are pots
(bunkers) on the holes that you share the fairway with that you can
run right into and still have to pitch out.''
</P>
<P>
   Personally, he'd like an old staple _ the wind _ to make an
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it blows because I think that's the tradition of the
British Open,'' said Woods, who is trying to complete the career
grand slam. ``I think any time the wind blows on any golf course,
it distinguishes the players who are playing well a lot faster and
more dramatically than when it is calm.''
</P>
<P>
   Be careful what you wish for, say longtime observers, because
conditions at St. Andrews can change in the time it takes one of
Woods's drives to travel 400 yards. Because of that, Vijay Singh
said, he wasn't spending any time worrying about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys who are not used to dry and fast conditions have just
got to get used to it right now,'' said Singh, the Masters champ.
``Otherwise, they're not going to contend.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of contention _ but a long way down the fairway, it seems.

ARMSTRONG STRUGGLES UP MOUNTAIN, STILL HOLDS OVERALL LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MORZINE, France _ The French sense of hyperbole must be rubbing
off on American Lance Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was the hardest day of my life on a bicycle,'' he said
after Tuesday's 16th stage in the Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   He sounded an awful lot like the television commentators who
exclaim ``Lance is suffering!'' or ``It looks like Marco Pantani is
pedaling backwards!'' if it looks as though a cyclist is having
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong might have suffered as he made his way up the final
mountain, and his overall lead did slip a little. But he finished
eighth in a stage that Frenchman Richard Virenque won in 5 hours 32
minutes 20 seconds, and still holds the overall lead, with a 5
1/2-minute margin.
</P>
<P>
   Italian Pantani and Colombian Santiago Botero went down in a
fall less than 3 miles into the 118-mile stage. But that was the
last of Pantani's troubles, as he and Botero made it back to the
pack, and Pantani proceeded to move to the front and lead the group
over the next three climbs.
</P>
<P>
   But as the roads wound north in the Alps and the cyclists hit
the final climb _ the highest category in the tour _ the mountains
started to take their toll.
</P>
<P>
   Pantani dropped back first, and Armstrong tried to keep up with
Virenque and Spaniard Roberto Heras. But he was obviously
struggling as he stood up in his saddle and grimaced. Other riders
went by him, most notably Jan Ullrich, who is in second place
overall.
</P>
<P>
   Heras and Virenque were headed for a neck-and-neck sprint to the
finish until the Spainard made a too-wide turn in the last mile and
crashed into a metal barrier holding the crowd back. While he sat
waiting for the team car to rush him a new bike, Ullrich cruised
into second place behind Virenque.
</P>
<P>
   Ullrich gained a couple minutes on Armstrong but Pantani dropped
more than 20 minutes back, to 14th place overall.
</P>
<P>
   Virenque, 29, has finished on the podium twice, with a third in
1995 and a second in 1997. In addition, he won the red-and-white
polka-dot jersey as best mountain climber five times, including
last year, when he finished eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Virenque fell out of favor with many cyclists two years
ago when the Festina team he was on was expelled because of drug
violations. All of its racers but three _ including Virenque _
admitted to drug use.
</P>
<P>
   But Virenque is undeniably a crowd favorite, as polka-dot signs
proclaiming ``Allez, Richard!'' line the course every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was glad to have good weather,'' said Virenque of the sunny
day with temperatures in the 60s. ``I felt really good on the rest
day Tuesday, and I told my teammates beforehand that I was going to
have a good day. And I could see Armstrong wasn't at his best on
the last descent.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong agreed he had a sluggish day.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, he said, was that he rode past the designated ``feed
zone'' halfway through the race where riders grab sacks of food and
drink, and opted not to take any time to slow down and snack, as
most riders do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't eat enough, and had no energy,'' he said. ``I knew I
was in trouble, so I stayed regular and rode pretty conservatively.
In a situation like that, it's better to not panic and stay in
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just happy to be finished with the Alps.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Tour announced Tuesday that it will cut back on the number
of vehicles it allows on the course in front of the riders. The
number of media, team, sponsor, and publicity cars has been cut
back by several hundred. ``We were going to do it for the 2001 race
anyway,'' said Tour spokeswoman Sophie del Rizzo, who acknowledged
that the move was expedited after last week's accident, in which a
car killed a spectator . . . Tyler Hamilton, of Marblehead, Mass.,
continues to move up in the overall standings. He is now in 28th
place, the highest-ranking American behind Armstrong . . .
Wednesday's stage crosses into Switzerland and finishes in
Lausanne.

   COLOMBIA-AID-$ADV23 _ BOGOTA, Colombia _ The U.S. Congress has
passed a $1.3 billion aid package for Colombia, but many wonder if
the money will be too
</P>
<P>
   little too late to save a country beset by violence, civil war
and a powerful leftist guerrilla army. Some critics fear the U.S.
is stepping into a Vietnam-style quagmire by sending military
advisors and sleek new helicopters to help battle Colombia's drug
lords, who along with Marxist guerrillas control vast areas in the
countryside. Meanwhile, Colombian President Andres Pastrana is
battling plummeting public support, a deep recession, icy relations
with the national congress, corruption charges and stalled peace
talks. (Williams, Cox News Service).

   With COLOMBIA-FARC-$ADV23 _ SAN VICENTE, Colombia _ Fueled by
tribute from coca-growers and drug lords, the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia or FARC has become one of the most potent

Switzerland-sized chunk of territory last year by Pastrana, the
FARC shows no signs of compromising in peace talks as they

   CHINA-DIVORCE-$ADV23 _ BEIJING _ The southern province of

a feudal practice the Communists eliminated 50 years ago:
concubines. Affairs and divorces have been on the upswing for years
in China, but men in Guangdong have taken marital
</P>
<P>
   infidelity to a new level _ they are known to take a mistress ?
or even two or three _ set them up in a house, even have children
with them. For wives who want a divorce, laws are so inadequate, it
could mean years of poverty for them. The problem has become so
serious, the province issued anew legal directive that

   BRUNSWICK _ BRUNSWICK, Ga. _ When Kendra McCrae stormed into the
Brunswick city manager's office recently and demanded an audience,
it was another sign of the continuing unrest in the coastal city
that has spawned violence, marches and calls for change. McCrae, a
28-year-old secretary, was upset over mistreatment she says she and
other blacks received at the hands of police during a July 4th
altercation. That holiday weekend confrontation, which eventually
turned violent, led to a subsequent protest march on Monday (July
17) with others planned. It has also revealed a wider set of
grievances. A loose coalition of residents and ministers is now
calling for sensitivity training for police, a community-wide forum
to discuss racial differences and better economic opportunities for
the city's black population. We examine the continuing evolution of
a city in transition. (Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

<P>
   BARTON-VICTIMS _ The lives that were changed by Mark Barton's
rampage; the woman who was robbed of her sight by Barton; the widow
who wakes up each day alone; the day traders who can't help but
shudder when they walk into their Buckhead office ... For this
story the reporters initially assigned to keep in touch with the
survivors and the families of the dead will go back and chronicle
how they have coped in the year since the shooting. (Judd, Atlanta

   GROWING PAINS FOR THE INTERNET

</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-HARDWARE _ WASHINGTON _ Even as the Internet is hailed
for expanding the horizons of millions of users and energizing the
world economy, there's concern it could become the victim of its
own success. Rapid growth of sites and users poses the very real
nightmare that this massive online structure,
</P>
<P>
   representing a $650 billion investment, could come crashing down
in gigantic cyber-traffic jams. (Glass, Cox News Service)

   INTERNET-SOFTWARE _ WASHINGTON _ WWW.any-site.com. To American
ears, this familiar pattern identifies a World Wide Web site on the
Internet. The system seems simple and settled, but a global battle
is being waged this summer over how addresses will be assigned to
keep pace with rapid Internet growth. The
</P>
<P>
   stakes are enormous. If plans to establish private control over
the Internet's address system founders on technical details and
political disputes, the global
</P>
<P>
   expansion of the online community could become gridlocked. But
if it succeeds, Americans will have to get used to having the
Internet governed by an international body that may be located in
Switzerland (Geewax, Cox News Service)

</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-TAKEN _ Pity the late-arriving entrepreneur who decides

   VOTERS-SUBURBMOMS _ DATELINE TK _ Four years ago, ``soccer
moms'' gained almost mythical stature as the coveted voting bloc
that would reelect President Clinton or give Republican Bob Dole a
fighting chance. In a close presidential race in 2000 between Al
Gore and George W. Bush, the women's vote is all-important, but
</P>
<P>
   more difficult to define and to attract. So far, polls are
showing that more men are strong supporters of their choice, where
women tend to be more flexible _undecideds or soft supporters of
Gore or Bush. In addition to the gender gap, there is a
particularly large ``marriage'' gap. Clinton led Dole among married
women 53% to 43% in 1996; Gore trails Bush 42 percent to 50
percent. (Holmes, Cox News Service)

   COXNET FOCUS 0722: CHINA CONNECTION _ Once a ``poor, backwards,
uneducated'' speck in the Henan province of China, in the words of
one local official, Sangpo is now a wired outpost. Its 4,800
residents boast private cars, cellular phones, about 100 personal
computers and a bustling Internet cafe. In 20 years, the village
has grown a sheepskin backyard business into a multi-million dollar
niche market. It now processes 5 million sheepskins a year, almost
half of China's total sheepskin imports. Technology has helped fuel
the growth. (Chao, Cox Washington Bureau). Art includes a 4-column

and businesses are moving toward paperless transactions. While the
need for envelopes won't be going away entirely, manufacturers say
they will have to adapt _ i.e., make the envolpes they produce more
technology inclusive as way of remaining competitive. Even the U.S.
Post Office is jumping on the Internet bandwagon, pushing its own

   DAYTRADING _ Day trading is still apparently pulling them in in
Atlanta. No stats on trading are available, but six firms are doing

   UPSAIR _ A subsidiary of UPS is testing a new technology that,
proponents say, can drastically reduce or even eliminate mid-air
and runway collisions. The experimental system known as ADS-B (for
Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast) also promises to
unclog aerial gridlock by allowing planes to safely fly closer
together and takeoff and land at shorter intervals. UPS will begin
equipping its own planes with ADS-B this year, and others including
FedEx, Airborne and DHL are likely to follow by the end of 2002
when all cargo planes will be required to carry collision avoidance
equipment. (Hirschman, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   SYDNEY _Sydney _ In going from Georgia to Australia, then, the
Olympics have gone from one British penal experiment to another.
This odd kinship of outcasts dawned on me as I was sitting at a
cafe beside Sydney Cove, the aquamarine inlet that sets off the
heart of the city like a jade pendant. Ferry boats were churning
through the whitecaps of crisscrossing wakes. On one side of the
cove, the Opera House roof loomed like the upturned prows of a
dozen giant rowboats. On the other side, blue Australian flags
streamed in the breeze atop the long steel arch of the Harbour
Bridge. It's hard to imagine now, but this postcard spot was where
the First Fleet landed in 1788 with a thousand convicts and
sailors. Ten thousand miles from home, they struggled and almost
starved yet somehow managed to transform their bitter exile into a
city and nation that will soon command the world's attention.

   FAT-SOUTHERNERS _We know that America overall has a weight
problem - by some measures, 50 percent of the population is at
least somewhat overweight. But what's the Southern piece of that
pie? According to a new AJC poll, Southerners are more likely than
people elsewhere in the US to admit to being ``moderately or
seriously'' overweight - even though they set the bar for what
constitutes ``overweight'' higher than residents of other states
do, and given even more latitude to men than they do to women. At
the same time, though, Southerners are more willing to blame their
own bad habits for their weight problems. Includes interviews with

Luxuries usually strewn about the family room are becoming popular
gadgets in cars and in roomy SUVs. Ever since Oldsmobile introduced

addition of video. And the automotive world is jumping the
bandwagon; every major manufacturer now offers video in the car.

LAW SAYS STEEL PLATE IN HAND WON'T SLOW HIM UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ His first contact with Bill Belichick was in 1996,
when he was a carefree kid just trying to get better as a football
player and make it to the Pro Bowl. Having accomplished that,
bigger things began happening to Patriots cornerback Ty Law.
</P>
<P>
   He became a megamillionaire last August when the Patriots opened
the vault and dumped a $14 million signing bonus and $50 million in
salary over seven years on his doorstep. He joined the ranks of
fatherhood this offseason, and proudly displays his little girl,
Tya, who waits for him after a grueling day of practice at training
camp.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other firsts, as well. For the first time in his
career, he suffered a serious injury last season. He broke his hand
Dec. 5 in a victory over the Dallas Cowboys, then played a week in
a cast before being placed on injured reserve, ending his season
for good on Dec. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Law revealed two things Tuesday: He played all of last season
with a fractured toe and he will play this season with screws and a
steel plate in his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have to play with a plate and screws all year,''
said Law. ``It's a case of feeling arthritic pain every now and
then, but it's nothing I can't handle. Basically fine. The
flexibility isn't all the way there because I have a plate and
screws in there. But I'm ready to roll in the Ty Law style of
football.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that he established himself as one of the top
cornerbacks in the game two years ago; thus, the huge contract. Law
remains bold, brash, and confident, and his experience will make up
for anything he might have lost as a result of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm 70-75 percent, I feel I'm better than a lot of people
at 100 percent, so I'm not going to go out there and complain about
an injury,'' he said. ``I don't make excuses about anything. It was
just getting out there and playing. It was a little injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of his injuries, Law said, he worked with legendary
track coach Bob Kersee in the offseason but curtailed some things
because he needed to rest his body.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, he's meeting up with Belichick again, but this
time Belichick is head coach, not an assistant. Law thought he knew
Belichick well, and even lobbied for him after Pete Carroll was
fired. But Belichick, like Law, has gone through some changes in
the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was going to be a little more simplified,'' said
Law. ``He sure put in a lot more stuff. It's coming along. I'm
working hard. It's going to take time.''
</P>
<P>
   Law is set at the left corner spot, but since his rookie season,
seven other cornerbacks have played on the opposite side. With
Steve Israel gone to New Orleans via free agency, Law will have an
eighth new man to get used to. Currently the top contender is
former Brown and 49er Antonio Langham, who has been working with
the first unit in practice. What Law does know is that Belichick
will throw everything and the kitchen sink at the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be a little bit of everything,'' said Law. ``He's basic
on first down, and on second and third down we'll have some fun. On
third down we're sending the house, but there'll be someone
blitzing all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Law said Belichick has brought Football 101 to training camp.
Some of the defensive assistants are coaching basic tackling
skills. Six years into his professional career, Law said, that has
been a big adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all professionals now,'' said Law. ``This is my sixth
season and you're showing me tackling drills? It's kind of hard.
You haven't paid that much attention to smaller things, but Coach
Belichick is the type to bring us back down to reality. We're going
out there right now in shoulder pads and we're out there running
and doing drills. He's got a bus for guys who don't make the
conditioning. It's something you desperately need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you want to tackle Coach Belichick once in a while.
He's changed a lot over the years. With four years gone, he's made
up new defenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Law said he never met anyone who spends more time on the finer
details of the game than Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll show some film, and when he sees a bad play, he'll play
it over and over 20 times until you know what you did wrong,'' said
Law. ``He always makes sure you know you're not too big for your
britches. He's amazing that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watch film, but there comes a time when you have to leave it
alone. It's like studying the playbook. You look at it over and
over and over. I swear he takes it to the toilet with him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots hope he takes it to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the changes, Law feels he has a handle on what Belichick
expects. Learning that will be the toughest thing for players who
aren't used to Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll have to figure it out in a hurry because they'll be on
the next plane home,'' said Law. ``It's all a matter of time. We're
getting better and better. He was upset at first because some guys
were out of shape, but we'll pay for it in the long run because
we'll be out there longer until we get it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Law didn't make the Pro Bowl last year, and he wants to return.
He wants to be part of the best secondary in football, the best
defense on earth, the best team in professional football. He'll
have to do it being a little older, with a little more to care for,
and perhaps in a little more pain.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``These should be the best years of my career
coming up. A lot of us have been together and gone through things
together. Now we'd like to see some good things. That's all we're
thinking about.''

 &HT;    Shareholders to consider Headhunter's acquisition of
CareerMosaic
 &HT;    By Kathy Brister
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Shareholders of Headhunter.net will decide today on a
deal likely to put the company at No. 2 in the national online job
market.
</P>
<P>
   The approval of Headhunter's purchase of Palo Alto, Calif.,
competitor CareerMosaic, would position the Norcross company behind
online job site, Monster.com, according to industry estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholder balloting comes a day after Headhunter.net Inc.
reported second-quarter revenues six times greater than the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the acquisition, announced in April, Headhunter
will pay $110 million in stock for CareerMosaic, owned by New
York-based advertising giant Omnicom. Headquarters of the merged
company will remain in Norcross.
</P>
<P>
   Headhunter's purchase of CareerMosaic would add more than
100,000 resumes to its bank of about 548,000. It also would add
CareerMosaic's Fortune 100 customer base to the 8,000 firms _
primarily mid- to small-size companies _ that now pay to post jobs
on Headhunter's site.
</P>
<P>
   And Headhunter would gain access to about $5 million in cash and
a $10 million line of credit now held by CareerMosaic. That's
important to the company, which last quarter added 27 sales people
in an effort to ramp up sales and marketing. It now employs about
300 nationwide, including about 150 in Atlanta, and will gain
another 50 workers through the CareerMosaic deal.
</P>
<P>
   But Headhunter's access to capital also is important to Wall
Street, said Robert Fontana, an analyst with Wachovia Securities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investment community is concerned about Internet companies
burning lots of cash,'' he said, noting by his estimates Headhunter
now has enough money to fuel its growth until third quarter 2001.
At that time, Fontana estimates, Headhunter should begin operating
in the black.
</P>
<P>
   In earnings released Tuesday, Headhunter reported a net loss of
$4.17 million on revenues of $9.8 million in the second quarter,
ended June 30. In second quarter 1999, the company reported a loss
of $2.6 million on revenues of $1.6 million. Per-share loss for the
second quarter of 2000 was 38 cents, compared to a loss of $1.17
per share in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Fontana said Headhunter's quarterly report beat all of
Wachovia's estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Headhunter Chief Executive Officer Bob Montgomery said merging
with CareerMosaic is likely to add to the bottom line because the
companies attracted different corporate clients and different
job-seekers. He estimates there is only a 10 to 12 percent overlap
in resumes posted on the two companies' sites.
</P>
<P>
   Headhunter's shareholder vote comes during a week marked by
consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Knight Ridder Inc. and Tribune Co. said they will buy
online job sites CareerBuilder Inc. and CareerPath.com Inc. The
purchase would link the Internet companies with 45 local daily and
national newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for online job sites is expected to grow from $1.2
billion to $8.2 billion in the next five years, according to
Forrester Research, a Cambridge, Mass., technology research firm.
</P>
<P>
   This week's online job site consolidations mirror what's
happening across the entire e-commerce marketplace, said Ellen
Julian, an analyst with Framington, Mass., technology-research firm
IDC.
</P>
<P>
   The mergers will cause a ``reshuffle in the leadership grid,''
leaving top players in good positions as both job-seekers and
companies narrow their online career site choices to those with the
highest numbers of job postings, resumes and site visits, she said.

&HT;     SENATE KILLS PATENT EXTENSION FOR COLUMBIA 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Tuesday killed a proposal that would
have extended a lucrative biotechnology patent for Columbia
University after critics complained that it was ``a
special-interest giveaway.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., who led the fight against the
patent extension, said it would have raised prescription drug
prices for people with debilitating diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Senate leaders stripped the measure from the pending must-pass
agriculture appropriations bill, according to Ed Amorosi, a
spokesman for Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., who had sponsored the patent
proposal. The leaders concluded that the controversial measure
would slow Senate consideration of the appropriations measure.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed patent extension could have enabled Columbia _
Gregg's alma mater _ to net $70 million to $150 million over the
next 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia's 17-year-long patent covering a key manufacturing
process for specific proteins in new drugs expires Aug. 15. The
process has been used to make 14 widely sold drugs and has netted
the university $280 million from biotech companies that manufacture
the drugs. The companies have paid a 1 percent royalty annually.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg said his amendment would grant Columbia and other
nonprofit research institutions the same right that drug companies
have to ask the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for patent
extensions to compensate for delays in initial approval by the Food
and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Under existing law, Columbia wasn't able to apply for an
extension because its patent was for a process, not an FDA-approved
drug. University officials argued the school was entitled to an
extension because Columbia received no royalties for five years
while drug companies licensed to use its patent awaited FDA
approval for specific drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg said it is only fair that the law allow inventors of
processes to apply for patent extensions just like inventors of
drugs. He also argued that Columbia's research would benefit
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a university that uses the money for research, does not
generate profits and which allows anybody to use the process,''
Gregg said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., has also fought for
Columbia's patent extension and said he doesn't want research to
dry up at a premier institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great research institution,'' Moynihan said. ``(The
patent) would be legitimately extended for just a little while and
all the money goes to research.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics including Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said it
would ``impose unacceptable increases in the price of prescription
drugs'' by delaying the sale of cheaper generic versions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unfair and unjust enrichment,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a special-interest giveaway.''
</P>
<P>
   Durbin has slammed Columbia's efforts to get a patent extension,
calling it the ``greening of the ivory tower.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are shedding crocodile tears about the high cost of
prescription drugs and they're turning around and trying to give a
windfall to Columbia University,'' Durbin said.
</P>
<P>
   Durbin said an extension for Columbia would raise prices for
people with serious diseases such as breast cancer, multiple
sclerosis, heart and stroke problems and hemophilia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't how we should fund universities,'' said Sen. Jim M.
Jeffords, R-Vt.
</P>
<P>
   Other congressional efforts to extend patents for pharmaceutical
companies also appear dead this year.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Chairman, was caught in a firestorm of criticism last month when
his staff floated legislation that would have allowed
Schering-Plough Corp. to seek a three-year extension of its patent
for Claritin through the Federal Court of Claims.
</P>
<P>
   The measure provoked outrage from consumer groups because it
would have automatically granted the patent extension while the
court considered it, which could take months or years.
</P>
<P>
   But Hatch now says he has ``no plans'' to slip the
Schering-Plough proposal through on a spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said all the major drug companies have come looking for
patent extensions to compensate for excessive time lost during
regulatory review at the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they can make a case for expanded patent life,'' Hatch
said. ``They deserve to make a case.''
</P>
<P>
   For four years Schering-Plough has sought legislation that would
allow it to seek a three-year extension of its patent. Supporters
have tried to add it to one of the must-pass spending bills, but
have backed off under criticism that it could cost consumers up to
$7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like Dracula,'' said Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt.
``Every time I think it's dead, someone trips over the coffin and
it pops up again. But I have a lot of stakes. I'll kill this. I
think we start a terrible precedent if we start doing patent
extensions on appropriations bills.''

GORE SAYS HE'LL FIGHT FOR VICTIMS BILL OF RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS _ Vice President Al Gore and Texas Governor George W.
Bush both agree on the need for a victims' bill of rights. A no
brainer, they both say.
</P>
<P>
   But mere consensus could not keep the issue from becoming
partisan fodder Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving in shirtsleeves for a forum with victims of violent
crimes and their relatives, Gore listened to the personal accounts
and then declared his intention to fight for the victims' bill of
rights if he is elected president in November.
</P>
<P>
   Kicking off several days of addresses and initatives on crime
prevention, Gore, appearing at Rhodes College, took credit for
helping to reduce crime nationally, and vowed to carry the
Clinton-Gore adminstration's successes further.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worth noting that for eight years now, we have seen a
decline in the number of crimes committed in the United States in
every category,'' Gore said. ``I want to continue that, but I think
it's high time, indeed long past time, to focus on the rights of
victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore proposes a constitutional amendment to give victims of
violent crimes and their families the right to attend sentencing
and parole hearings for those who committed the crimes, to be
notified when the criminal is up for parole or released from
prison, and to take time off from work to attend legal proceedings
without penalty from their employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a law enforcement president,'' he said. He
repeated the line that has become a mantra for him: ``I'm for the
people, not for the powerful.'' And victims of crime are
``sometimes the most powerless people.''
</P>
<P>
   After the forum, Gore hugged some of the people gathered with
him, who had told stories of crimes he called ``unbearable
horrors.''
</P>
<P>
   Jodie Gaines Johnson, who was kidnapped, held captive for five
days and raped repeatedly by three men said she feared her
attackers would be released and she wouldn't know about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be in the grocery store and run into them,''
she said. ``Cause I am not strong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``God bless you,'' Gore said after she had finished speaking.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's support for victims of violent crimes was featured in ads
launched by the Democratic National Committee 17 battleground
states a few days ago. Tuesday's proposals added specifics to that
30-second spot.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-two states have enacted victims' bills of rights. In
April, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, and
Republican Senator John Kyl, of Arizona, proposed a constitutional
amendment very much like the one Gore urged Tuesday, but without
the provision allowing victims time off from work. Their
constitutional amendment did not come to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl called Gore ``disingenuous'' in a conference call with
reporters Tuesday, arguing that the Clinton administration had been
responsible for the proposal's demise.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's getting a freebie here,'' Kyl said. ``He's for something
it's easy to say you're for. But his administration has not
supported the only version that could make it to the Senate for a
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyl said the administration balked at the amendment because it
did not sufficiently protect the rights of the accused. Gore
spokesman Chris Lehane said the amendment was derailed by
prosecutors who worried that some of its provisions would
prosecutions more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Kyl accused Gore of being ``AWOL on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Gore aides distributed a list of his statements and
votes in favor of victims' rights dating back to a 1977 vote to
compensate victims of violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that Senator Kyl is playing presidential
politics here,'' Lehane said. ``If he were really concerned about a
victims' rights amendment, he would welcome Al Gore's policy
proposal as opposed to trying to score cheap political points.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore arrived at the college after two other stops, one at a
local police station, where about 20 officers stood around him
awkwardly while he outlined some of his proposals, and another at a
day care program at the Evergreen Presbyterian Church near the
college, where his audience of four and five-year-olds rushed
toward him, asking, ``Is that the president?'' telling him their
mothers voted for him, and giving him high-fives.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave me high-fives on both my hands!'' shrieked one boy.
``We're not washin' em!''

STUDY BACKS EARLIER CHOLESTEROL TESTING IN MEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Men should begin taking aggressive steps as early as their 20s
to reduce high cholesterol levels and thereby lower their risk of
fatal heart disease, according to new information from studies of
81,000 young men who were followed for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, concern about elevated cholesterol has been focused
mainly on middle-aged people since increasing age raises their
heart disease risk. Only a few small studies previously linked high
cholesterol early in life to heart disease later on.
</P>
<P>
   But now, researchers at the Northwestern University School of
Medicine in Chicago, analyzing three large studies, report that
relatively young men with high cholesterol (240 milligrams per
deciliter or above) were 2 to 3 1/2 times more likely to die from
heart disease than those whose levels were below 200.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, cholesterol levels ``are an important risk factor
throughout life'' and should be reduced in people as young as 20,
said Dr. Jeremiah Stamler, a preventive medicine specialist at
Northwestern's medical school.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he said, abnormally high cholesterol in young men
actually increased their risk of heart disease more sharply than it
did in middle-aged men.
</P>
<P>
   The effect was so marked that, in the studies, men with
cholesterol levels below 200 lived 4 to 9 years longer than those
whose levels exceeded 240.
</P>
<P>
   The data showed that 2/3 of the heart deaths among those in the
study occurred in the 1/3 of the men who had high cholesterol when
they were young adults, said Stamler, lead author of the report in
the current issue of the Journal of the American Medical Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important paper because it provides strong evidence
for the value of early detection'' of high cholesterol, said Dr.
Sidney Smith, former president of the American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are understandable concerns about about the cost of
screening young individuals, and (questions about) the benefits of
treating a younger population,'' added Smith, chief of cardiology
at the University of North Carolina. The new report, he said,
``suggests the benefits will be there.''
</P>
<P>
   The report is based on analyzing three long-term studies in
which younger men were followed for as long as 34 years. One
included 11,017 men in 84 Chicago companies; the second involved
1,609 men employed by the Peoples Gas Company; the third comprised
69,025 men from the multicenter MRFIT (Multiple Risk Factor
Intervention Trial) study.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial accompanying the JAMA report, Dr. Scott Grundy
of the Univeristy fo Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas
noted that the new findings reinforce earlier suggestions that
cholesterol-lowering should begin earlier in life.
</P>
<P>
   It is, he said, ``a necessary first step in the effort to reduce
the risk of (coronary heart disease) in the one-third of young
adults who have total cholesterol levels higher than 200''
milliliters per deciliter.
</P>
<P>
   The American Heart Association already recommends that
cholesterol readings be made every five years beginning at age 20,
Nevertheless, Grundy said, the opportunity to get such early
screening is often missed because busy doctors can't take time to
counsel young, healthy patients about reducing their cholesterol,
which can be done through diet modification and also by taking
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In truth, financial incentives are few and, in general,
long-term prevention is not attractive to managed care,'' wrote
Grundy.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Libby, chief of cardiovascular medicine at Brigham and
Women's Hospital, said the study reinforces the potential value of
a ``more aggressive stance'' in attacking high cholesterol
relatively early in life.
</P>
<P>
   He echoed Grundy's concern about too little emphasis on
prevention in the health care system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prevention is under-rewarded,'' he said. ``HMO's have little
incentive to prevent illnesses that may occur in a 10 to 20 year
span, when the average length of time a member is with a health
care plan is under five years.''
</P>
<P>
   At Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Massachusetts' largest HMO,
cholesterol screening is done according to guidelines based on
recommendations by the Heart Association and other groups, said Dr.
Roberta Herman, medical director for clinical policy and programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our current recommendation is that screening begin at age 20
or the first appropriate opportunity,'' said Herman. As for
treatment, she said, HMO officials assume that ``the provider and
the member are going to work together to determine what makes
sense.''

CAROLINE KENNEDY SCHLOSSBERG TO ADDRESS DEMOCRATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLEN JOHNSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg will make a rare
speech at the Democratic National Convention next month to recall
her father's memory, while Senator Edward M. Kennedy will assume
his traditional role as party motivator.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy oratorical one-two punch will also mark a set of
family highs and lows: the 40th anniversary of John F. Kennedy's
winning the Democratic nomination in Los Angeles, and the first
anniversary of the death of John F. Kennedy Jr. in an airplane
crash off Martha's Vineyard. In 1988, the younger Kennedy addressed
Democrats at the Atlanta convention that nominated former
Massachusetts Governor Michael S. Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Kennedy Schlossberg has steadily emerged from
seclusion to assume a more prominent family role, handing out the
annual ``Profile in Courage Award'' at the Kennedy presidential
library in May and attending a Tall Ships party July Fourth in New
York aboard the aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy. She had
christened the ship when she was 7 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the speech is a rarity for Kennedy Schlossberg, an
attorney and mother of three who has written about and covets her
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Family intimates and an aide to Vice President Al Gore, this
year's nominee, said Tuesday that the Democrats' return to the city
where President Kennedy was nominated spurred the sole survivor of
his immediate family to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Aides are considering having Kennedy Schlossberg and her uncle
address the convention during TV prime time on Tuesday, Aug. 15,
although details are still under discussion. The senator always
plays a prominent role at the conventions, but this year's setting
and anniversary are expected to trigger a wave of nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what you're going to see is Caroline giving a shorter
address linking back to her father and the senator having a much
more fiery address to motivate the Democratic troops,'' said a
party source, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ``That's
certainly what the convention needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore enjoyed a bounce this year after the senator endorsed him
in Boston and then twice visited Iowa and New Hampshire on the vice
president's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Will Keyser, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Democrat, said:
``The Democratic Party is very interested in having Senator Kennedy
play a prominent role in Los Angeles. The details are still being
worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Mark Fabiani confirmed that Kennedy Schlossberg
would speak, but he would not discuss the details. Her role was
first reported Tuesday on NBC's ``Today.''
</P>
<P>
   The speaking roles for Kennedy Schlossberg and her uncle have
parallels with the appearance by her brother and Senator Kennedy in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   During the Atlanta convention, John F. Kennedy Jr. brought the
delegates to their feet with his introduction, a speech that
prompted speculation about his own political future.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he died as a 38-year-old magazine publisher on July 16,
1999, in an airplane crash that also killed his wife, Carolyn
Bessette Kennedy, and her sister Lauren Bessette.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over a quarter of century ago, my father stood before you to
accept the nomination for the presidency of the United States,''
John F. Kennedy Jr. said 12 years ago. ``So many of you came into
public service because of him and in a very real sense, it is
because of you he is with us today.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Kennedy went on to deliver his famous ``Where was
George?'' attack on then-Vice President George Bush _ the father of
this year's Republican candidate, Texas Governor George W. Bush.

   &QL;   &QL;  &UR; Bonior At the Ready If Gephardt Runs With Gore &QL;   &UR; By Laura J.
Winter &QL;  &QC;  C. 2000 States News Service &QL;  &QC;  WASHINGTON (July 18) -
Heading off party dissent, Minority Whip Rep. David Bonior, D-Mt.
Clemens, is making it clear that if the Democratic Minority Leader
seeks to run as the party's vice presidential nominee, he would be
prepared to take over his party's top House leadership role.
</P>
<P>
   Reports that Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., might be asked to run
alongside Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore, prompted Bonior
and his staff to start Friday laying claim to the House party helm.
While Gephardt said Tuesday he is not seeking the vice presidency,
he did not say he would turn down the job if asked.
</P>
<P>
   Bonior's press secretary Fred Clark said calls made over the
weekend to Sunday television talk show bookers and pundits was an
effort to send a message: The Democrats will have a leadership
structure in place well before November's general election no
matter who turns out to be Gore's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot a lot of speculation over the past few days.
As to whether Mr. Gephardt was being courted for V.P.,'' Clark
said. ``We don't know what he is going to do, but we have to
prepare for any contingency and plan for a seamless transition.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonior, however, was not available for comment. And his press
secretary steadfastly refuted any charge that the move was purely
an ambitious one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not want there to be a story out there that there would
be a leadership vacuum,'' Clark said. ``The goal is to make it
clear that we are all working together to take back the house. That
there is no tension between leaders and both of them are focussed
on taking back the house in November.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonior has been speaking with Democratic House leaders on how
best to fill leadership roles in case Gephardt had to take up other
duties, Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Once it became known that Gephardt and Gore held a secret
meeting earlier this month, speculation that the St. Louis
representative might accept a the vice presidential role began to
build. While Gephardt continued to say his focus remains on
retaking the house, there are those on Capitol Hill that say he
might just go for it, if asked.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to firmly state firmly that he would not be Gore's running
mate, Gephardt said, ``I am for Al Gore. You know that. I have
supported him from the beginning of his campaign almost, and I
think he would make a great president of this country and I hope he
wins,'' Gephardt said. ``As you know I have been very focussed on
one thing and that's winning back the majority in the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., has also been touted as a possible Gore
running mate. Gore is expected to announce his vice presidential
choice on August 3, the last day of the Republican National
Convention, in Philadelphia. The Democratic National Convention
will take place in Los Angeles starting August 14.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to Democrats who do not see eye-to-eye with
minority whip, said Bonior would be the most obvious choice to at
least temporarily succeed Gephardt if the need arose. The caucus,
in any event, will hold an election in January to choose its
leaders for the new Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Democrats, while adhering to the party platform, do
not have Bonior's affection for labor unions, many voting in favor
of Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China - a legislative
battle Bonior lost.

PROPOSALS FOR DEVELOPING THE WEST OF IRELAND INCLUDE A NEW CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  By DAN BARRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KILMOVEE, Ireland _ The exact downtown location of the new city
he is proposing for this country's isolated West must remain vague,
William Thomas said, for fear of speculators. To provide a rough
idea, though, he mounted a stone wall and swept his hand in the
general direction of a curious cow and the hoof-pocked pastures
beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Other details are more specific, at least on paper. The
metropolis that would rise from undesirable farmland in counties
Mayo and Roscommon would include an initial population of 100,000,
apartment complexes designed for ``maximum tranquillity,'' the
finest in hospitals and schools, and even an ice rink designed for
international competition. As for its name, Thomas said he prefers
``The City of the Sacred Heart,'' for the inspiration he receives
from his Roman Catholic faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be seen as an option right now, but it will become a
necessity,'' said Thomas of his proposal. He is a defense
consultant to the Irish and other governments, who added that he
also ``invents things.''
</P>
<P>
   For all its fantastic elements, Thomas' idea has spurred
national debate, and is being embraced by a bishop and other local
leaders. They say that poor roadways and the medieval makeup of
towns have largely prevented the western counties from enjoying the
economic boom that has Dublin, to the east, bursting in population
and prosperity. The region's only recourse, they say, may be to
start from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of a new city also taps into the West's long-held
belief that it is an Irish afterthought, a place whose greatest
export seems to be young adults forced to pursue careers elsewhere.
Every Friday night, buses return to the struggling town of
Ballaghaderreen, jammed with people who have spent the week working
in Dublin, more than three hours away.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, Thomas has impeccable timing. As he promotes
his emerald city, a team of government planners is toiling away in
the Custom House in Dublin, tinkering with maps of Ireland. Their
two-year assignment: to develop a ``national spatial strategy'' to
spread the country's resources and opportunities more evenly.
</P>
<P>
   That quest is part of Ireland's plan for its future, a plan that
focuses in large part on how to spend nearly $60 billion in
development funds, some of which comes from the European Union. The
objectives are to ensure economic stability, promote education and
to share the wealth enjoyed in the eastern and southern regions of
the country with the West, the Midlands, and the counties bordering
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The greater Dublin area now accounts for about 40 percent of
Ireland's population of 3.6 million. International investment and a
plethora of high-technology jobs have sent housing prices soaring,
clogged its narrow roads and drained other regions of their
educated young. Meanwhile, the agricultural industry that
traditionally sustained the west is on the wane.
</P>
<P>
   Finian Matthews, the director of the unit working on the spatial
strategy, said these were the reasons the ``the government is eager
to create more parity and economic opportunity regardless of where
people live.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, Matthews and his team are working to identify a
few ``gatewaycommunities'' that would become regional hubs through
the investment of billions of dollars. In theory, these centers
would ease Dublin's troubles and revitalize the country's aged
towns and villages. Country roads would become highway links
between hubs; a student in remote Connemara would have the same
opportunities as one in fashionable Ballsbridge, in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   News of the spatial strategy and the loads of money attached to
it have stoked territorial pride. Larger towns, like Sligo in
County Sligo and Athlone in County West Meath, are presenting
themselves as obvious gateways. But Matthews said no decisions had
been made; his team is still studying statistics, consulting
experts, and reconfiguring maps that he declined, for obvious
reasons, to share.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, Matthews has received a copy of Thomas' proposal, which
prominently describes itself as ``real and magnificent, and if
successful would change the way the Irish think about themselves,
forever.'' The planner recently thumbed through the proposal _ with
its drawings of wide boulevards and suggestions for a chapel in
every home _ with an expression that was somewhere between a
grimace and a grin.
</P>
<P>
   Early research suggests that the investments would best be spent
on existing towns, Matthews said diplomatically, although he added,
``We're not ruling in or out any option.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas' idea has prompted debate and reflection in the West,
where there is an average of about 20 people to each square
kilometer (0.62 mile), compared with 1,147 for each square
kilometer in Dublin. Scarred and emptied by the famine 150 years
ago, the West continues to lose its young people, and with them its
stories and its vibrancy. Only Galway, the region's one city, seems
on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Harkin, chairwoman of a nonprofit organization called the
Council for the West, said that ``using urban solutions for rural
problems is not the way to go.'' And Sheila Caulfield, a
spokeswoman for the Western Development Commission, a public agency
that aims to foster growth in the West, said that while the
commission emphasized the need to invest in small towns, the
concerns of Thomas were well-founded.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Flynn, the bishop for the Roman Catholic Diocese of
Achonry, which includes the proposed site, enthusiastically
supports the plan. Sitting in a spare and hushed office in
Ballaghaderreen, Flynn acknowledged that the idea ``does call for a
way of thinking that we haven't been accustomed to.'' But, he
added, ``I think it's salable.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, a stout man with an intense gaze, said that he chose the
30-square-mile site after considering several factors, including
the close proximity of Knock International Airport and the recent
discovery of gas fields off the coast of County Mayo. He said he
has no idea who owns the land, although he thinks the government
lays claim to a good chunk of it.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he had no intention of benefiting financially from
his idea. He is content, he said, to continue living in his small
farmhouse on the outskirts of Galway, where he writes books on
Catholicism and keeps a collection of exotic birds. ``I'm just
offering the idea to the nation,'' he said. ``More than that I
cannot do.''
</P>
<P>
   As he toured the site the other day, Thomas paused at the ruins
of Urlar Abbey, a national landmark that sits within the boundaries
of his would-be city. Studying its haunting beauty, he vowed to
keep it intact.

REBEL WITHOUT A FILM BIOGRAPHY ... UNTIL NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD, July 19 _ The death of James Dean in a car crash in
1955 turned that brooding 24-year-old movie star into a tragic
legend and symbol of alienation and hurt among teen-agers in the
1950s and 1960s. But while other icons of the era, like Elvis
Presley and Marilyn Monroe, have been grist for a steady stream of
novels, biographies and movies, Dean has, surprisingly, been
somewhat ignored, especially in films. It's not for a lack of
trying.
</P>
<P>
   For years filmmakers have toyed with projects about James Dean
but were locked in a Catch-22: studios would only finance the movie
with a star, or at least a name actor. But these actors shied away
from playing the 1950s icon.
</P>
<P>
   The playwright Israel Horovitz, who had worked on a James Dean
screenplay for years, recalled that the actor Ethan Hawke had told
him: ``If you do a James Dean imitation, they'll kill you. If you
don't do a James Dean imitation, they'll kill you. There's no way I
can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, however, being done, with Horovitz's script, for the TNT
network. The film, ``James Dean: An Invented Life,'' is now in
production in Los Angeles. It will be shown next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``His legend has not been treated with appropriate respect,''
said Mark Rydell, 70, the film's director, whose credits include
``The Rose'' and ``On Golden Pond'' and who was a friend of Dean's
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   To play Dean, Rydell and Bill Gerber, the movie's executive
producer, selected James Franco, a little-known, 22-year-old
television actor from Palo Alto, Calif. More than 500 actors
auditioned for the part, sent tapes or were interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Rydell said he had cast Franco almost as soon as he saw the
actor, who bears a resemblance to Dean, and spoke to him at length.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met Mark Rydell, and he was like an analyst,'' Franco said.
``We were talking a long time about personal stuff: my parents and
issues I had with them and the trouble I had gotten into as a
teen-ager and why I became an actor. I read very easily, and there
was no pressure to give a kind of final performance. Afterwards he
gave me a hug and told me I had it. I was amazed.''
</P>
<P>
   Franco, who has appeared in some television films and
independent features as well as the NBC series ``Freaks and
Geeks,'' said that during his teen-age years he was often told that
he looked like Dean. ``I don't have blond hair and blue eyes, like
he did,'' said Franco. ``But they took care of that. I got
contacts, and they dyed my hair.''
</P>
<P>
   To put himself in the role, Franco told his girlfriend he was
not going to see her while making the movie and informed his
parents he would not be speaking to them. ``I took up smoking, like
Dean, and cut off most of my friends,'' he said. ``I'm doing
everything I can to approximate his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean's life was tormented. Horovitz and Rydell said that Dean's
three films, ``Rebel Without a Cause,'' ``East of Eden'' and
``Giant,'' were stamped by his playing characters who were, like
him, anguished, angry and lonely. Horovitz said the screenplay was,
largely, a story about Dean's hunt for a father who abandoned him
when he was 8 his mother died. ``Dean's father was a dental
technician who worked at a VA hospital in Santa Monica,'' said
Horovitz, ``and when the boy's mother died of cancer, the father
shipped the body back on a train to Fairmount, Ind., with the boy
to live with his aunt and uncle. He chased his father's affection
through his young life.''
</P>
<P>
   Years later Dean turned to directors like Elia Kazan, George
Stevens and Nicholas Ray and even executives like Jack Warner as
father figures. Just before his death Dean signed what was then an
unprecedented $1-million deal with Warner for nine films. ``He
spent his life trying to prove to his father that he wasn't
worthless,'' Rydell said.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Dean's personality and the characters he played on
screen seemed to foreshadow some of the mood of the 1960s and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He appealed to the young because he understood that youth knew
some truths about the world that adults had looked away from: about
the unfriendly cities, the instinct for violence and forsaken
emotional sensibility,'' wrote David Thomson in A Biographical
Dictionary of Film (Knopf). ``Although he was vulnerable and
sensitive, he never suggested youthfulness or callowness. On the
contrary, he seemed older, sadder and more experienced than the
adults in his films.''
</P>
<P>
   Rydell put it another way: ``He was indeed the first rebel.''
Referring to ``Rebel Without a Cause,'' he declared, ``The film _
and Dean _ demonstrated that adolescents are loaded with anxiety
and torture and rage.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dean screenplay had been circulating at Warner Brothers for
nearly a decade under the aegis of Marvin Worth, producer of
``Lenny'' (1974) and ``The Rose'' (1979). Worth, who died in 1998,
came close to making the film in 1994 with Leonardo DiCaprio and
Michael Mann as director. But Mann, director of ``Heat'' and ``The
Insider,'' said that DiCaprio seemed too young at the time and
wanted to wait for a year or so.
</P>
<P>
   By that time they had each moved on to other projects. Other
directors like Des McAnuff and Marc Rocco, and actors like Stephen
Dorff got involved to one degree or another in the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing much happened,'' recalled Gerber, formerly a top
Warner executive. ``It just kind of hung around. It was just hard
to find bankable names that Warner Brothers would finance a $20
million movie with. And there were marketing problems. He died in a
highway accident in 1955. He isn't that well known by the
moviegoing public these days.''
</P>
<P>
   The project would probably have died with Worth, but Gerber
suggested it as a movie for cable television, where inclusion of a
big name star is not as important as it is for theatrical release.
TNT, owned by Time Warner Inc., is seen in about 77.5 million
homes. Julie Weitz, TNT's executive vice president of original
programming, said the story carried a certain resonance for
television viewers, especially those in their 30s and 40s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's as hip and relatable today as he was years ago,'' said
Weitz. ``At the core of this story is a movie about a child, and he
stays a child. And that's timeless.''
</P>
<P>
   Rydell said he was friendly with Dean in the '50s when they were
struggling theater and television actors. ``He was a remarkably
charming and quirky and unpredictable fellow,'' said Rydell. ``We
were walking down Madison Avenue one Sunday after doing `Omnibus'
on CBS. He was talking to me about bullfighting, which was a
passion of his. A bus was hurtling down Madison, passing many stops
because it was so quiet. And suddenly Jimmy leapt into the street,
whipped his jacket off and did a bullfighter's pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bus literally grazed his shirt. I was horrified. He
giggled. I thought this kid would never live because he was so
reckless. And what happened a few years later was tragic.''

RATING AN OPERA FESTIVAL, BY ITS CACHET AND ITS TRAVELS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN RIDING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France _ Europe's summer opera festivals are
often judged by the cachet of those they attract, not only the
artistic renown of the conductors, directors and performers but
also the social standing of the audiences. But there is another
less obvious gauge: which festivals stay alive during their long
off-seasons by taking their productions to other cities, perhaps
even to other festivals.
</P>
<P>
   By both measures, things have been going well for the
international opera festival of Aix-en-Provence since a management
shake-up in 1998. This year's festival, which runs through July 28,
includes four new productions and a repeat from 1999, all presented
by big-name conductors and directors, while its sold-out houses
visibly sparkle with European elites. At the same time, opera
lovers who cannot make it here are increasingly able to catch its
shows elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to make the festival known around the world,''
explained Stephane Lissner, who took over as director of the
festival three years ago with precisely that mandate. ``Many of our
productions are in demand even before they are created. What makes
Aix different, though, is that we concentrate on young singers, and
the tours give them the chance to be seen and heard by directors,
critics and audiences in other cities.''
</P>
<P>
   After Lissner's first season three productions _ Mozart's ``Don
Giovanni,'' Purcell's ``Dido and Aeneas'' and Britten's ``Curlew
River'' _ traveled widely around Western Europe. Last year it was
the turn of Mozart's ``Zauberfloete'' to tour European cities,
while Aix's version of Monteverdi's ``Coronazione di Poppea'' was
seen in Vienna (and returned here this year) and its production of
Offenbach's ``Belle Helene'' will be performed next month at the
Salzburg Festival.
</P>
<P>
   This year's productions will also carry the Aix brand name to
new arenas. Janacek's ``Makropulos Case'' is scheduled for the
Theatre de la Monnaie in Brussels this fall and may be seen in
Paris and Vienna, too. Monteverdi's ``Ritorno d'Ulisse in Patria''
and Rossini's ``Cenerentola'' will have long European tours, and
Mozart's ``Cosi Fan Tutte'' will travel to the Theatre des
Champs-Elysees in Paris in October and probably to the Lincoln
Center Festival next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Of course some features of the Aix festival remain very much
rooted in this medieval Provencal town. The European Music Academy,
created by Lissner in 1998, brings together 100 or so young singers
and instrumentalists for two months of workshops, concerts and new
opera productions (this year, ``La Cenerentola'').
</P>
<P>
   At the same time this summer's parallel program of concerts has
attracted star conductors like Pierre Boulez, Sir Simon Rattle and
William Christie as well as the rising British conductor Daniel
Harding.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is the opera program that generally stirs the most
interest, with particular attention given this year to the new
production of ``Cosi Fan Tutte,'' the first Western opera to be
tackled by Chen Shi-Zheng, the New York-based Chinese director who
took the epic Chinese opera ``The Peony Pavilion'' to last year's
Lincoln Center Festival. The production was accompanied by the
Concerto Koeln, conducted by the Belgian baroque specialist Rene
Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Cosi' is staged so often that my worry was, could I do
something different?'' Chen said after the premiere. ``I didn't
want to go through the psychoanalytical approach of Western
theater. I wanted to challenge what Western audiences think the
opera is about by playing it in a different environment. I didn't
want to make a moral statement about infidelity, but to entertain,
so it plays out like a children's game, a sort of teen-age opera.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen creates an Asian mood through Peter Pabst's set, with its
willow tree and lilies floating in pools of water, and the
kimonolike costumes for Fiordiligi (sung here by Alexandra
Deshorties) and Dorabella (Liliana Nikiteanu). Yet it is the
mischievous humor of the production that provides its appeal, with
Guglielmo (Stephan Genz) and Ferrando (Jeremy Ovenden) joking and
teasing as they test the flightiness of Fiordiligi and Dorabella
under the lighthearted guidance of Don Alfonso (Pietro Spagnoli).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Makropulos Case,'' on the other hand, is a far more somber
affair in Aix's new production by the talented young French
director Stephane Braunschweig, with Sir Simon Rattle conducting
the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. This opera, which tells
the story of a century-old dispute between two Czech families,
revolves around the mysteriously old Emilia Marty. And with the
veteran German soprano Anja Silja returning to the role that she
first sang in 1972, the high drama of the story was more than
assured.
</P>
<P>
   Le Monde's music critic, Alain Lompech, went out of his way to
praise Silja's majestic domination of the stage, which, he said,
more than compensated for occasional signs of age in her voice. But
he insisted that the entire cast as well as director, designer and
conductor were ``touched by grace'' in this production. ``One
emerges from this performance not just moved,'' he added, ``but
shaken by some unforgettable scenes in which it is impossible to
separate seeing from hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cosi Fan Tutte'' and ``The Makropulos Case'' were staged in
the courtyard of the old Archbishop's Palace in Aix, and ``La
Cenerentola'' was performed outdoors in the Domaine du Grand
St.-Jean, an 18th-century chateau six miles from here that was
added to the festival's venues last year. And ``Il Ritorno d'Ulisse
in Patria'' seemed like the perfect opera for the 485-seat Theatre
du Jeu-de-Paume, an 18th-century jewel that has just had a $5
million restoration.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Noble, who heads the Royal Shakespeare Company, directed
the opera with a simplicity that well suited the intimacy of the
theater, while the Orchestre Les Arts Florissants, using period
instruments, was conducted by its founder, Christie. ``Noble has
created a spectacle of unusual depth with almost nothing,'' Renaud
Machart, another Le Monde critic, noted of the minimalist decor. At
the same time the youthful energy of the singers, notably Kresimir
Spicer as Ulisse and Marijana Mijanovic as his loyal wife,
Penelope, brought lightness to what is, after all, a long opera.
</P>
<P>
   The festival has now presented Monteverdi's three surviving
operas in successive years. But with Mozart, around whom this
festival was founded in 1948, there is of course much more to do.
Next year ``The Marriage of Figaro'' will be directed by Sir
Richard Eyre, the former head of Britain's National Theater, with
the Mahler Chamber Orchestra conducted by Marc Minkowski.
</P>
<P>
   But the 20th century will not be overlooked. In a production
directed by Luc Bondy and conducted by Harding, Britten's ``Turn of
the Screw'' will be presented in the Jeu-de-Paume.

COVENT GARDEN CHIEF TO LEAD KENNEDY CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
   By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Michael Kaiser, the New York theater and ballet
manager who helped rescue Royal Opera House at Covent Garden in
London from a financial crisis, is about to be named president of
the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, a Kennedy Center
official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser, who announced last month that he was returning to the
United States, said then that he would leave Covent Garden at the
end of the 2000-01 season, but the Kennedy Center official said
Tuesday that Kaiser was scheduled to start his duties here on Feb.
1, well before the end of next season.
</P>
<P>
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the
appointment is to be announced formally on Wednesday after the
center's board formally votes its approval and that Kaiser would
not be available for comment until then.
</P>
<P>
   As chief executive at at Covent Garden, Kaiser virtually
eliminated the budget deficit and created a permanent endowment.
When he announced his resignation he said the decision to quit was
``the most profoundly difficult'' of his career, adding, ``But for
personal reasons it is time for me to return to my home.'' After
hearing of Kaiser's decision, Sir Colin Southgate, the Royal Opera
House's board chairman, said, ``We owe him a huge debt of
gratitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser will succeed Lawrence J. Wilker, who announced in April
that he would leave his post at the end of the year and, following
the path of many other executives these days, would join a new
Internet venture.
</P>
<P>
   Wilker's announcement came a week after Nathan Leventhal said he
would leave his job as president of Lincoln Center. That created
the unusual circumstance of the nation's two leading performing
arts centers recruiting chief operating officers at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser, the official said, told the search committee, ``I was
the world's worst board member because I was meddling all the time,
and that's when I realized it was what I wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   After he realized that he wanted to make arts administration his
career, Kaiser sold his business consulting firm and, the Kennedy
Center official said, ``started cold at the Kansas City Ballet and
worked his way up.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser was also executive director at the Alvin Ailey American
Dance Theater and American Ballet Theater, helping restore those
companies to financial health.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser, 47, told the search committee that he was a lover of the
performing arts who was raised in a performing arts family. His
grandfather was a violinist with the New York Philharmonic, and one
of his earliest memories is of spending every Saturday at the
orchestra's rehearsals.
</P>
<P>
   The presidency of the Kennedy Center is the No. 2 post, behind
the chairmanship, which puts Kaiser in day-to-day charge of the
center's operations and performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a demanding job, with 3,300 performances a year,'' said
James A. Johnson, chairman of the Kennedy Center, when Wilker's
resignation was announced. ``There are six or seven stages
operating in an evening when everything is full.''
</P>
<P>
   Leventhal's salary at Lincoln Center was $525,000 a year and
Wilker's at the Kennedy Center was $325,000. The Kennedy Center
official said that Kaiser's salary was still being discussed and
that it would be competitive with similar positions in the
performing arts.

BEAUJOLAIS, ALWAYS FRIENDLY AND READY TO PLEASE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC ASIMOV   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A good bottle of Beaujolais, fruity and undemanding, bypasses
the analytical portion of the brain and heads directly to the
pleasure center. This wine is versatile with food and
thirst-quenching _ gulpable, as they say.
</P>
<P>
   Though Beaujolais enjoys its moment in the spotlight every
November, when the newly bottled nouveaus are shipped, it is, in
fact, a perfect hot-weather red.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for that is that Beaujolais tastes great lightly
chilled, about half an hour in the refrigerator before serving. And
it goes with almost anything, from burgers to fried chicken to
Indian takeout food.
</P>
<P>
   But the best thing about Beaujolais is its easy, open nature. If
Burgundy is a mysterious, inscrutable cat of a wine and Bordeaux a
beautiful thoroughbred, Beaujolais is simply a good pooch, young,
frisky and eager to please.
</P>
<P>
   Of the many breeds of Beaujolais, Georges Duboeuf is the best
known and most popular. Most Duboeuf wines are light, fruity and
stylistically consistent, though I found his 1998 Julienas to have
more depth than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Jadot, a big name in Burgundy and Beaujolais, makes wines
more muted than Duboeuf's but no less pleasing.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller producers are more idiosyncratic, a little more
expensive, but can be more exciting, making handcrafted wines that
add texture and richness without compromising the basic Beaujolais
likability.
</P>
<P>
   Clos de la Roilette from Coudert, for example, is a wine that
you may not find on every corner but rewards the hunt. The Granger,
Bertolla and Michaud, too, are worth seeking out.
</P>
<P>
   Even though these wines have more dimensions to them, they are
still light in spirit, joyous rather than weighty. You wouldn't
retire to the library to drink Beaujolais. It's for the kitchen
table, and certainly for outdoors.

 &HT;    TIRED, TENSE MIDEAST NEGOTIATORS, CLINTON MAKING ONE FINAL PUSH
FOR PEACE
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ President Clinton pressed Mideast peace talks
deep into the night Tuesday in deadline diplomacy aimed at securing
an Israeli-Palestinian treaty before his scheduled departure for
Japan on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   With Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat still at odds over the core disputes dividing them,
White House officials were hopeful that threats to shut down the
talks by Wednesday morning would force the adversaries to make
their best efforts to strike an overnight deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``People know that they've got a lot of work to do,'' White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters gathered in this
Catoctin Mountain hamlet five miles from Camp David, the
presidential retreat where the talks have been held since July 11.
``There isn't time to push issues aside or not deal as directly as
they can in the negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Clinton sought to make the most of the looming deadline,
though, he was weighing whether to delay his departure another day
to buy more time for a shot at peace in one of the world's most
contentious regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a judgment that has to be made,'' Lockhart told
reporters, advising them to stay tuned for developments through the
night. ``I'm not sure I could describe the balancing act there.''
</P>
<P>
   In one sign that Clinton might put off his departure, the White
House delayed until Wednesday the press flight for reporters
covering the president's trip to Japan. The press charter had been
scheduled to leave the Washington area Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is due in Tokyo Thursday afternoon for a bilateral
meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials won't say the meeting is non-essential,
but it's no secret that the agenda is light.
</P>
<P>
   Logistically, Clinton could postpone the meeting with Mori,
leave Washington Thursday morning and still arrive in Okinawa _ the
southernmost island in the Japanese archipelago _ in time for the
main event of his trip: the annual summit of the leaders of the
so-called Group of Seven richest nations, plus Russia.
</P>
<P>
   That could get him 24 hours of overtime to try to wrest a peace
treaty out of the Camp David talks.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations are centered on the core issues in the
52-year-old Palestinian-Israeli dispute. Those include the question
of Palestinian statehood, the future of Jerusalem, territory and
security, and the fate of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   As negotiations intensified, Clinton met with Barak four times
between Monday night and 4:30 a.m. (ET) Tuesday. He caught a few
hours of sleep, then went into a one-hour meeting with Arafat
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton's mood has swung with the atmospherics
inside Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like all of them, you go through various emotions ranging from
moments where you see promise to moments where the only thing you
see is frustration,'' said Lockhart. In a word, though, he
described Clinton as ``determined,'' to broker a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between Arafat and Barak have run so high that U.S.
diplomats have kept them apart since Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In eight days of talks, Arafat and Barak have held just two
direct, one-on-one meetings, the last of which was Saturday. Since
then, they've encountered each other only informally, at a meal,
for example, with others present and seated between them.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart stressed, though, that the lack of direct talks between
Barak and Arafat doesn't mean the negotiations have stalled. Much
can be done to narrow the gaps between them, Lockhart said, by
using Clinton as an intermediary and a buffer to preserve what
diplomatic goodwill still exists between the Israeli and
Palestinian sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 52 years of debate behind them, so the atmosphere at
times has been tense,'' Lockhart said. ``But they are still working
at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lending the weight of his own schedule to the brinkmanship,
Lockhart told reporters late Tuesday ``this may be the last time''
for him to hold his twice-daily summit briefings.
</P>
<P>
   He stressed, though, that he had not yet packed his bags to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Washington, D.C.-based Arab American Institute
released the results of a nationwide poll Tuesday that showed a
majority of American voters support the Palestinians' right to an
independent state.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 890 likely voters, conducted by New York-based
Zogby International July 14-17, showed 66 percent favored a
Palestinian state as well as 63 percent agreeing with Clinton's
handling of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The poll had a margin of error of +/-3.4 percent.

GORE PROPOSES AMENDING CONSTITUTION TO GUARANTEE VICTIMS' RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. _ Jodie Gaines Johnson was kidnapped, held
captive for five days without water or food and raped repeatedly by
three men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know the criminal system, I was just thrown in
there,'' Johnson said of the process that led to her captors'
conviction. ``And my perpetrators are now starting to be paroled. I
want to know when they're paroled. I have four kids, and I don't
want to be in the grocery store and run into them. I'm not that
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was one of more than a dozen victims, relatives of
victims and law enforcement officers who told their stories Tuesday
to Vice President Al Gore as he sought to highlight a package on
crime prevention that he is proposing in his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   One key proposal is a constitutional amendment _ similar to one
that the Clinton administration opposed _ that would guarantee
victims like Johnson certain rights, among them the right to be
notified of a perpetrator's release and the right to have their own
safety considered in determining any conditional release.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gore's proposal would give victims the right to be
heard at sentencing, the right to be included in any public
proceedings related to the crime, the right to restitution from a
convicted offender and the right to a trial without unreasonable
delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The accused criminals have all kinds of rights, and we all
understand why that is important,'' Gore said. ``But here is the
point: When those rights are enshrined in the Constitution and the
rights of victims are not, whenever the two come into any kind of a
conflict, it is not even a close contest. The victims are put in
the back seat and sometimes even ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   The amendment is part of a victim's bill of rights that Gore
proposed Tuesday. It would allow victims to leave work to attend
legal proceedings, much the way jurors are excused from work. Gore
said his measure would cost $685 million over 10 years and would be
paid for with money from the projected budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed amendment is based on legislation that the
administration had worked to defeat, in part because officials were
concerned that excessive victims' rights might interfere with fair
trials.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., who, with Sen. Dianne Feinstein,
D-Calif., has sponsored such an amendment, said in a conference
call with reporters Tuesday that Gore had ``been AWOL from this
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   The briefing by Kyl, who said he was irked that Gore was trying
to get credit for something that the administration had blocked,
was arranged by the campaign of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The senator said the administration had insisted that the rights
of criminals would never be ``subservient'' to the rights of
victims. ``They basically said that, in the case of a tie, the
defendant always had to win,'' Kyl said. ``It bothers me now that
Al Gore is trying to use this politically and in a fraudulent way,
because he's never been helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Being tough on crime is a central piece of the New Democrat
approach to policy that Gore _ and President Clinton, for that
matter _ has long embraced. Both support the death penalty, for
example. ``I want to be a law-enforcement president,'' Gore said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee began running a television
commercial last week in 17 states that shows Gore promoting the
constitutional amendment and victims' rights. He says, among other
things, that victims should have the right to speak at the trial of
the accused.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl said that few supported this idea. He also said that his
proposed amendment, which is considered dead for the year, did not
guarantee the right of an employee to be excused from work to
attend a trial, but did guarantee that the victim could not be
excluded from a trial.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, 32 states have laws that give victims the right
to be heard, though usually at the time of sentencing and not when
a jury is considering guilt or innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kyl said he had 41 other sponsors for his proposed
constitutional amendment, altering the Constitution is difficult at
best.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of new constitutional amendments say that this method
of social correction is overused as a political remedy to complex
problems and that in this case, it could easily delay trials and
interfere with plea bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told the victims who were gathered by his campaign to
Rhodes College here on Tuesday that he has ``always been very
reluctant to support a constitutional amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   One constitutional amendment that he did support was the Equal
Rights Amendment, although he was not in Congress when it passed in
1972. After it failed to be ratified by the states, however, he did
vote in 1983 for the amendment to be revived.
</P>
<P>
   He also opposed one other constitutional amendment. In 1989,
when he was in the Senate, he voted for legislation to protect the

constitutional amendment to protect the flag.

   He told the victims, ``No one should have to go through what you
went through,'' referring not only to the initial crime but also to
``what you experienced in the aftermath of the crime, entering the
criminal justice system that sometimes treated you as an

justice system, deserving of protection, just as much as those who
are accused of having committed a crime against you.''

SENATE APPROVES TAX RELIEF 
FOR DUAL-INCOME COUPLES

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican-led Senate passed legislation
Tuesday to provide $248 billion in tax relief to dual-income
couples hit by the so-called ``marriage penalty,'' creating a
potential issue at the party conventions this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's action followed last week's House passage of
similar legislation that would provide $182 billion in relief. GOP
leaders in the Senate and House are expected to quickly hammer out
the differences.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate marriage-penalty bills would remove over
the next decade tax-code provisions that force 25 million
dual-income married couples to pay an average of $1,400 more in
federal income taxes than they would if they were single. The
difference between the two measures is that the Senate bill would
provide slightly more tax relief than would the House version for
couples in the 28 percent tax bracket.
</P>
<P>
   The unified legislation could reach President Clinton's desk in
advance of the GOP National Convention, which begins July 31 in
Philadelphia. Clinton, speaking through a spokesman Tuesday,
threatened to veto the measure unless it also contains the $250
billion in Medicare prescription drug coverage he seeks for seniors
during the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very clear that the Republicans in Congress have decided
to put aside their responsibilities and to play politics,'' said
presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart. ``They've made it very clear
that they want to get bills done timed to their convention so they
will have something to talk about at their convention. The
Democrats, on the other hand, I think have a stronger candidate so
we don't need to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's 61-38 vote to remove the marriage penalty followed
its 59-39 vote Friday to repeal the federal estate tax over the
next decade. Clinton has also vowed to veto that measure, now
headed to his desk, saying the repeal would largely benefit only
the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans who are assessed the tax.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the two repeal measures before the Democratic president
could make the proposed tax breaks major issues at the GOP's
convention July 31-Aug. 3 in Philadelphia. At the convention
Republicans are expected to formally nominate Texas Gov. George W.
Bush to be their party's presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, meanwhile, will hold their national convention Aug.
14-17 in Los Angeles, where they are expected to pick Vice
President Al Gore as their presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has praised the two measures, saying that removing estate
and marriage penalty taxes would bring fairness to the federal tax
code. ``The governor believes these are positive moves that will
benefit American families, farms and small businesses,'' said Bush
campaign spokesman Ray Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore has assailed the GOP's proposed repeals as helping
primarily the wealthy at the expense of providing ``targeted tax
relief for working families,'' his campaign said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-backed tax breaks come amid Congressional Budget
Office projections of a budget surplus of $2.17 trillion over the
next 10 years, including a $102 billion surplus next year. Citing
the surplus, Republican leaders have pressed for tax relief, while
Democrats have sought more money for health care and education.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas and the chief sponsor of the
marriage penalty repeal, said removing the tax will help working
parents in their efforts to pay doctors' bills and educate their
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is who controls the money you earn,''
Hutchison said after the vote. ``Should it be you, or should it be
the federal government? We believe it should be the hard-working
American family that keeps more of the money it earns, to spend for
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., challenged Clinton
to sign both the estate tax and marriage penalty repeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two bills, and especially this (marriage penalty) bill,
are a step in the right direction, allowing the people to keep a
little bit more of their hard-earned money and still leaving plenty
of (tax) money for education and defense and health research and
paying down the debt,'' Lott said at a news conference with
Hutchison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now this is going to be clear, very clear, Mr. President,''
Lott added. ``Sign it. It's the right thing to do for working
couples in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., however, accused the
Republicans of being more concerned with giving tax breaks to the
wealthy than helping the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans call their plans the death tax repeal and the love
tax repeal,'' Daschle said. ``What they are really doing is
offering a . . . tax break that disproportionately benefits the
wealthiest families at the expense of everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said the Republican proposal would not only reduce taxes
for the 25 million couples stung by the marriage penalty but give
an unfair benefit to nearly 20 million other married couples. These
couples are either unaffected by the penalty or pay less in taxes
because they file jointly and one spouse earns significantly more
than the other.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate votes to repeal estate tax and marriage penalty fell
short of the 67 affirmative votes that would be needed to override
presidential vetoes. On the marriage penalty, eight &UR;  &LR; Democrats
broke party ranks in voting for the repeal, while only
one &UR;  &LR; Republican _ George Voinovich of Ohio _ split from the GOP in
opposing the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation, the standard deduction for married
couples would be raised to twice the deduction allowed for singles.
For tax year 2000 that would mean raising the standard deduction
from $7,350 to $8,800, an increase of nearly 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To give a rough illustration of the marriage penalty, imagine an
unmarried police officer and a school teacher each making $30,000
per year in taxes. Individually, each would pay about $4,500 in
taxes based on a 15 percent tax bracket, leaving each with $25,500
after taxes for a combined total of $51,000.
</P>
<P>
   But, if they were married, their joint income of $60,000 would
be taxed at 28 percent, leaving them with $43,200 after taxes.
Their ``penalty'' for being married would be $7,800, the difference
between $51,000 and $43,200. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The GOP-dominated House passed its marriage penalty repeal
measure last week, 269-159, with 48 Democrats breaking party ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Tax historians are split on the origin of the marriage penalty.
Some attribute it to the unintended mathematical result of a
graduated income tax that increases with wealth. Others say it
arose from less enlightened, male-dominated Congresses that sought
to discourage wives from leaving the house by imposing an
additional tax on two-wage earner couples.

COUNTERSUIT FILED IN CANCER TREATMENT RESEARCH CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RAJA MISHRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In an escalation of a high-stakes scientific struggle,
prominent cancer researcher Dr. Judah Folkman and Children's
Hospital Tuesday countersued drug giant Abbott Laboratories Inc.
for fraud and defamation, accusing the Illinois company of
resorting to lies and threats in attempting to steal a potential
blockbuster cancer discovery.
</P>
<P>
   The scorching 47-page legal attack files in US District Court
Tuesday was a response to Abbott's May 30 lawsuit accusing
Folkman's lab of a ``conspiracy'' to falsely claim credit for
discovering a substance that could save lives by starving cancerous
tumors to death.
</P>
<P>
   The dueling lawsuits are a nasty byproduct of the
hyper-competitive world of cancer research, where a discovery of a
single molecule can be worth billions and a cure is perhaps the
most sought-after prize in all medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Tumor starving is seen as the most promising avenue of cancer
research and Folkman is its acknowledged father. He has become an
almost messianic figure among cancer patients, half a million of
whom die every year in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The ongoing trials of the cancer drugs stemming from his work
are among the most-watched in a generation. None of the current
trials are affected by the lawsuits. But Tuesday, Children's
alleged that Abbott's legal attack could slow future discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   The case ``has cast a cloud over Children's and the individual
scientists, jeopardizing their ability to obtain funding for their
research activities and forcing them to expend valuable time,
energy and resources to respond to the defamatory statements,''
stated Children's in its court filing.
</P>
<P>
   The heavily publicized Abbott lawsuit personally devastated
Folkman, said colleagues. His lawyers promised _ and delivered _ a
strongly worded response.
</P>
<P>
   The legal back-and-forth has been unusually personal for the
otherwise staid world of patent law. Tuesday's filing upped the
ante, adding a defamation of character charge to the already
complex scientific dispute, claiming Abbott devised a ``malicious
campaign to intimidate and harass'' the Children's researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abbott sees some very valuable technology. They tried to get
it fairly and legitimately and they couldn't,'' said Children's
lead lawyer William F. Lee. ``What they've done now is threaten
unfairly the thing that's most important to Dr. Folkman and
Children's _ their reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Abbott maintained Tuesday it was the sole discoverer of the
tumor-starving breakthrough in question and would continue to make
its case in court. It has 20 days to respond to Tuesday's
counter-suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since our proprietary intellectual property is at the heart of
our ability to fulfill our mission, we must vigorously defend our
rights to our discovery,'' said Abbott spokeswoman Ann
Fahey-Widman.
</P>
<P>
   After Abbott responds, the case will enter a phase where the
scientists can be questioned under oath and documents can be
subpoenaed, though the two sides have already exchanged significant
sheafs of information in the three years of failed negotiations
that preceded the legal clash.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy boils down to a scientific whodunit: who knew
what when?
</P>
<P>
   It centers on a protein called plasminogen found in blood.
Plasminogen is divided into five regions dubbed ``Kringles.''
</P>
<P>
   Undisputed is that Folkman's lab discovered the anti-tumor
potential of the first four Kringles, publishing its results in a
series of mid-1990s groundbreaking papers.
</P>
<P>
   Tumors thrive by creating their own blood vessels in a process
called angiogenesis, a discovery that is Folkman's signature
insight. His lab established that Kringles 1-4 could shut down the
process in mice, a finding that electrified the medical world.
</P>
<P>
   But Abbott, in its lawsuit, claims its own researcher, Dr.
Donald Davidson, is the discoverer of the anti-tumor potential of
Kringle 5. Davidson is an expert on plasminogen. According to court
documents, in early 1994 Folkman's lab requested supplies of
plasminogen from three sources: Notre Dame University,
Carnegie-Mellon University and Davidson's lab at Abbott. Abbott was
not engaged in any tumor-starving research at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott claims that, at this time, Davidson began his own Kringle
5 studies and found _ for the first time _ that properly treated
Kringle 5 had stronger anti-tumor properties than Kringles 1 to 4.
He told Folkman's lab about it and they ran off with the idea
straight to the patent office, claims Abbott.
</P>
<P>
   Children's Tuesday argued that Dr. Yihai Cao, then a researcher
in Folkman's lab, made the Kringle 5 discovery on his own. Cao was
able to draw on two decades worth of research in Folkman's lab,
noted Children's lawyers, while Davidson was a cancer research
neophyte.
</P>
<P>
   Cao published his findings in the Journal of Biological
Chemistry, sending a draft to Davidson. In a recent interview, Cao
maintained he made the discovery on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don Davidson never published his data. He never showed any of
it to me,'' said Cao. ``I know I created this idea in my brain. I
know what I was thinking, I know what I planned. I know what I
did.''
</P>
<P>
   During a recent interview at his suburban Chicago home, Davidson
said he could not elaborate on the lawsuit because Abbott placed
him under a gag order two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides sought patents on Kringle 5's cancer fighting
properties. The US Patent Office approved both. In fact, clashing
patents are not uncommon and usually settled in court. In that
regard, this case is typical. Abbott is asking that Children's
patent be rescinded; Children's is requesting the reverse.
</P>
<P>
   What is unusual is the angry rhetoric leveled by both sides,
with Abbott accusing Children's of being ``engaged in a scheme'' to
steal the discovery. Tuesday, Children's responded by alleging
Abbott's lawsuit was calculated to ``damage the good reputation''
of Children's and its scientists and ``intimidate them'' into
relinquishing credit for their work.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman's colleagues have said he is depressed by the case,
worried that a black mark will always appear next to his otherwise
brilliant resume. Cao, recently speaking from Stockholm where he is
researcher at the Karolinska Institute, said the Scandinavian
scientific community is abuzz with talk of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has upset me and my family, too. You try to help other
people and other people try to bite you back. It makes you wonder
why you do it,'' he said. ``I'm just starting my career at the age
of 40. I have a long way to go. I don't want to damage it.''
</P>
<P>
   The bitter legal fight may have years to go but the tests on the
tumor starving drugs pioneered by Folkman's lab _ called
angiogenesis inhibitors _ continue to plow ahead.
</P>
<P>
   One drug, Endostatin, is undergoing Phase 1 testing at the
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and two centers elsewhere,
to see if it is safe to take.
</P>
<P>
   Another drug Angiostatin, is further along, having recently
started initial human testing at Thomas Jefferson University in
Philadelphia. Although the entire cancer community is intensely
interested in the outcomes, no results have yet been released.

<P>
   BOSTON _ When a patient receives the diagnosis of cancer, a
first question that springs to mind is: Why me? For those with a
family history of the disease, like a woman whose mother had breast
cancer or a man whose father had prostate cancer, the physician
offers as a facile answer, ``heredity.'' The pernicious seeds of
the tumor were presumed to be present in the blueprint of the
person's DNA, drawn at conception and programmed to blossom decades
later. For those with cancer in the lung or throat who smoked, the
disease is readily ascribed to the carcinogens in cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Although a family history of a certain cancer or exposure to a
known environmental toxin like tobacco are certainly germane, they
still do not fully explain why that particular individual fell ill.
Moreover, for most people with the disease, there is no apparent
link to family history or lifestyle carcinogens. While we suspect
the answer is related to something in their genes or their
environment, we cannot offer them a cogent reply.
</P>
<P>
   Human biology has been daunting in its complexity, and out of
necessity, medical science is forced to simplify it in creating
concepts of illness. Sharp divisions are often drawn where they do
not actually exist. Disorders are routinely categorized as being
hereditary, dictated by genes, or environmental, due to ambient
toxins or microbes.
</P>
<P>
   The relative importance of nature vs. nurture in illness forms
the fabric of heated debate among scientists. The announcement of
the decoding of the human genome last month fueled the determinist
camp that contends that nature, meaning our inherited DNA, explains
most pathology. Starting from this premise, scientists and biotech
executives presented intoxicating scenarios depicting a direct path
from deciphering our genome to the demise of virtually all
diseases, particularly cancer. We were told we are on the brink of
a clinical utopia of almost mythic character where pathology and
decay are poised to be banished from our midst. As the public
spirits soared, so did the share prices of genome companies.
</P>
<P>
   Such heady pronouncements caused the proponents of environmental
factors to bristle. It comes as no surprise, then, that a study
published last week in the New England Journal of Medicine,
indicating a relatively small impact of heredity compared with
environment on the sporadic development of most common cancers, has
been used as fodder to deflate the genomists' claims, and to argue
that our attention and resources should be devoted to investigating
ambient toxins.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, nearly 45,000 pairs of identical twins in
Scandinavia were compared with fraternal twins. Since identical
twins have identical genes, while fraternal twins share an average
of 50 percent of their DNA, differences in the incidence of cancer
between the two types of twins can provide an indication of the
relative roles of genes vs. environment. The researchers concluded
that environmental factors play major roles and genes relatively
minor roles. The exceptions appeared to be prostate and colorectal
cancer, where the effects of heredity were more prominent.
</P>
<P>
   What was missing from the Scandinavian study was an analysis of
the dynamic and intimate interaction that occurs between our genes
and the world around us. Indeed, the statistical model applied by
the researchers assumes that no interactions occur between our DNA
blueprint and external toxins like tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Remote from sophisticated statistics, common sense strongly
argues that this dynamic interaction should be our focus. We all
know of people who have smoked three packs a day of unfiltered
cigarettes and lived well into their 90s without developing lung or
throat cancer, or those who made alcohol a primary part of their
diets and yet preserved healthy livers free of cirrhosis. We see
this variability in outcome as well among women who have a powerful
inherited susceptibility to breast cancer, carrying mutations in
their BRCA genes. Their chance of developing breast cancer ranges
from about 50 percent to 80 percent, not 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly our growing knowledge of the genome will help us make
sense of this individual variability. In the case of cigarettes, we
will learn which genes are important in metabolizing tobacco
carcinogens in our bodies. This will be one piece of the puzzle.
Another piece will be knowledge of which genes are damaged in the
airway cells by tobacco smoke, causing healthy ordered growth to
cease and unleashing the wild proliferation of cancer. The amount
and types of tobacco carcinogens the individual encounters will be
factored into the equation of his genes. We may then begin to
explain differences in who gets sick and who doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   The information gained from deciphering our genome will
radically alter our long-held and largely static paradigm of the
genesis of disease, particularly cancer. Over the decades, it will
become increasingly clear that the debate about heredity vs.
environment was miscast. Physicians will begin to craft more
intelligent and complete answers to the patient's poignant question
``Why me?'' and offer specific advice on not only how to treat the
disease but also how the environment may be altered for both the
patient and the patient's family.

COURT REJECTS BAY STATE CIGAR LABEL RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH RANALLI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A federal appeals court has struck down Massachusetts'
landmark warning label regulations for cigar packaging and
advertising, ruling that they are an unconstitutional restriction
of interstate commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The news wasn't as good, however, for cigarette manufacturers,
whose arguments against advertising regulations based on free
speech grounds were all rejected. The appeals court upheld all of
the tough state restrictions on cigarette advertising, including a
total ban on ads within 1,000 feet of a school.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit came
less than than three weeks after seven major cigar manufacturers,
accounting for 95 percent of the cigars sold in the United States,
struck a deal with the Federal Trade Commission for a
less-restrictive national warning label standard.
</P>
<P>
   The two recent developments in the battle between regulators and
the cigar industry had both sides sounding Tuesday as if they were
ready to light up a victory smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for what we did, there wouldn't be a consent
decree between the cigar industry and the FTC,'' said Greg
Connolly, head of the state Tobacco Control Program. ``We may have
lost, but overall I think the nation is better off for what
Massachusetts did.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul MacDonald, owner of the venerable David P. Ehrlich tobacco
shop in Boston, however, said the state had clearly ``overstepped''
its authority by requiring ``huge'' warning labels on both cigar
packaging and advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people in the industry do not object to warnings as long
as they are discreet and reasonable,'' MacDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   The state rules required stark, black and white warning labels
that covered 25 percent of the front surface area of a cigar packet
or box and 20 percent of a print advertisement. The agreement
between the cigar manufacturers and the federal government calls
for labels less than half that size.
</P>
<P>
   Still, anti-smoking advocates have hailed the June 26 agreement
as a breakthrough, since it is the first national warning label on
a tobacco product to warn about the effects of second-hand smoke.
</P>
<P>
   In a 58-page ruling made public Monday, the appeals court took
issue not with the size of the Massachusetts warning labels, but
the scope of the regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The justices held that the restrictions on advertising appeared
to apply to national publications like newspapers and magazines,
which would be forced to either print a special in-state edition
for Massachusetts or apply the restrictions nationally. Such a
dilemma posed an ``undue burden'' on interstate commerce, the
justices ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The court applied similar logic to the state requirement for
warning labels on cigar packaging. The way the state regulations
were written, the justices found, manufacturers would be liable for
penalties if any of their cigars were sold in Massachusetts without
the required packaging.
</P>
<P>
   That left cigar makers unconstitutionally liable for actions by
third parties, such as tobacco distributors and sellers, who might
bring unlabeled cigars in from out of state.
</P>
<P>
   The state cigar regulations never actually went into effect,
since the lower court had ordered them put on hold pending the
appeal. Most cigar packaging, however, already carries a California
warning label that has so far passed legal muster.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Connolly said the state will now push for tougher
warnings on cigarettes, and, later this week, announce the results
of a study comparing the effectiveness of American cigarette
warning labels vs. tougher Canadian ones.

 &HT;    TIRED, TENSE MIDEAST NEGOTIATORS, CLINTON MAKING ONE FINAL PUSH
FOR PEACE
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ President Clinton pressed Mideast peace talks
deep into the night Tuesday in deadline diplomacy aimed at securing
an Israeli-Palestinian treaty before his scheduled departure for
Japan on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   With Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat still at odds over the core disputes dividing them,
White House officials were hopeful that threats to shut down the
talks by Wednesday morning would force the adversaries to make
their best efforts to strike an overnight deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``People know that they've got a lot of work to do,'' White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters gathered in this
Catoctin Mountain hamlet five miles from Camp David, the
presidential retreat where the talks have been held since July 11.
``There isn't time to push issues aside or not deal as directly as
they can in the negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Clinton sought to make the most of the looming deadline,
though, he was weighing whether to delay his departure another day
to buy more time for a shot at peace in one of the world's most
contentious regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a judgment that has to be made,'' Lockhart told
reporters, advising them to stay tuned for developments through the
night. ``I'm not sure I could describe the balancing act there.''
</P>
<P>
   In one sign that Clinton might put off his departure, the White
House delayed until Wednesday the press flight for reporters
covering the president's trip to Japan. The press charter had been
scheduled to leave the Washington area Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is due in Tokyo Thursday afternoon for a bilateral
meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials won't say the meeting is non-essential,
but it's no secret that the agenda is light.
</P>
<P>
   Logistically, Clinton could postpone the meeting with Mori,
leave Washington Thursday morning and still arrive in Okinawa _ the
southernmost island in the Japanese archipelago _ in time for the
main event of his trip: the annual summit of the leaders of the
so-called Group of Seven richest nations, plus Russia.
</P>
<P>
   That could get him 24 hours of overtime to try to wrest a peace
treaty out of the Camp David talks.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations are centered on the core issues in the
52-year-old Palestinian-Israeli dispute. Those include the question
of Palestinian statehood, the future of Jerusalem, territory and
security, and the fate of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   As negotiations intensified, Clinton met with Barak four times
between Monday night and 4:30 a.m. (ET) Tuesday. He caught a few
hours of sleep, then went into a one-hour meeting with Arafat
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton's mood has swung with the atmospherics
inside Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like all of them, you go through various emotions ranging from
moments where you see promise to moments where the only thing you
see is frustration,'' said Lockhart. In a word, though, he
described Clinton as ``determined,'' to broker a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between Arafat and Barak have run so high that U.S.
diplomats have kept them apart since Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In eight days of talks, Arafat and Barak have held just two
direct, one-on-one meetings, the last of which was Saturday. Since
then, they've encountered each other only informally, at a meal,
for example, with others present and seated between them.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart stressed, though, that the lack of direct talks between
Barak and Arafat doesn't mean the negotiations have stalled. Much
can be done to narrow the gaps between them, Lockhart said, by
using Clinton as an intermediary and a buffer to preserve what
diplomatic goodwill still exists between the Israeli and
Palestinian sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 52 years of debate behind them, so the atmosphere at
times has been tense,'' Lockhart said. ``But they are still working
at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lending the weight of his own schedule to the brinkmanship,
Lockhart told reporters late Tuesday ``this may be the last time''
for him to hold his twice-daily summit briefings.
</P>
<P>
   He stressed, though, that he had not yet packed his bags to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Washington, D.C.-based Arab American Institute
released the results of a nationwide poll Tuesday that showed a
majority of American voters support the Palestinians' right to an
independent state.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 890 likely voters, conducted by New York-based
Zogby International July 14-17, showed 66 percent favored a
Palestinian state as well as 63 percent agreeing with Clinton's
handling of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The poll had a margin of error of +/-3.4 percent.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Chechen leaders appointed by Moscow are supposed to
help the Kremlin tighten its grip on the breakaway region. But
Tuesday they quarreled bitterly among themselves and even engaged
in a dangerous round of saber-rattling.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation, which occurred in Gudermes, the region's
administrative capital and second-largest city, underscores the
difficulties Russia has encountered in establishing a Chechen
government that has the support of the Chechen people.
</P>
<P>
   It was also an embarrassment to President Vladimir Putin. He met
with the Chechen leaders at an air base in Mozdok, a few miles
outside Chechnya, just two weeks ago and urged that pro-Moscow
Chechen forces play more of a role in bringing order to the region,
where Russian troops have been fighting Chechen rebels since
September.
</P>
<P>
   The episode began when Bislan Gantamirov, a pro-Moscow leader of
a Chechen paramilitary unit, sent 200 of his men into Gudermes,
ostensibly to search for rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Gantamirov, a former mayor of the Chechen capital, Grozny, was
imprisoned for embezzlement before the current military campaign in
Chechnya. But he was released so that he could fight on the Russian
side.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the Russians appointed him deputy administrator in
their new Chechen government and gave him responsibility for
security as part of Moscow's effort to contend with the rebels'
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   But Gantamirov is also been a bitter rival of Akhmad Kadyrov,
the Russian-appointed administrator of Chechnya, who is based in
Gudermes. And Gantamirov's operation in Gudermes on Tuesday was
widely seen as an attempt to intimidate Kadyrov.
</P>
<P>
   Kadyrov, a former Muslim religious leader, opposed the Russians
during the 1994-96 Chechen war, when Russian troops attempting to
break a drive for Chechen independence were driven out of the
Caucasus republic. But he has cooperated with Moscow since Russian
troops returned last fall, after raids on neighboring Dagestan and
apartment bombings that the Kremlin blames on Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Kadyrov has been the target of several assassination attacks and
has been struggling to establish his authority in Chechnya since
his appointment last month.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was Kadyrov's decision to dismiss several local
officials, including some apparently loyal to Gantamirov, that
prompted Gantamirov to send his men to Gudermes. ``We are the
people who fought our way from the border with Ingushetiya to
Grozny and we won't be bossed around by Kadyrov and his gang,''
Gantamirov said.
</P>
<P>
   As tensions grew, Kadyrov made it clear that he did not welcome
Gantamirov's s troops and had certainly never endorsed their
mission to sweep the city. ``Gantamirov did not clear this
announcement with me and received no approval to carry out such an
operation,'' Kadyrov said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military became concerned, too. Russia's armed
forces are tied down coping with the rebels' guerrilla tactics. The
last thing they needed was a clash among their own allies.
</P>
<P>
   So Lt. Gen. Ivan Babichev quickly moved to keep order. The
Russians said that Gantamirov and Kadyrov would meet to try to
resolve their differences.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid a firefight, Gantamirov's men were allowed to pass
through the checkpoints on the outskirts of Gudermes. But Babichev
later warned Gantamirov's militia to leave Gudermes and suggested
they would be fired on if they did not.
</P>
<P>
   Or as he put it, Gantamirov's militia, if it did not leave
Gudermes, ``will be regarded as a rebel formation with all the
ensuing consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the only time that the performance of the pro-Moscow
Chechen military has come under question. Russian soldiers say that
Gantamirov has vastly exaggerated the importance of his unit in the
capture of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   And Gantamirov and his men were discharged from their duties by
Russian authorities this spring after the Russians complained the
Chechen militia had failed to carry out its responsibilities and
had disappeared along with their weapons. Gantamirov, however, was
recently hired after the militants unleashed a wave of bombings and
stepped up their guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Gen. Gennady Troshev, the senior Russian commander in
Chechnya, has also pointed to problems Moscow has had with
pro-Moscow Chechens, though he did not blame the men under
Gantamirov's command.
</P>
<P>
   According to Troshev, a Chechen militia unit recently captured
Shirvani Basayev, the bother of Shamyl Basayev, the Chechen
warlord. Apparently fearful that the detention would subject then
to reprisals, the Chechens then let him go.

BUSH CONTINUES BRINGING CAMPAIGN TO THE INNER-CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Passing the boarded up businesses and shuttered
homes with sagging front porches, Texas Governor George W. Bush
came to this worn-out inner-city neighborhood Tuesday, much the way
he has visited other struggling areas and struggling people as he
campaigns for president and for recognition as a different kind of
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Day after day, Bush has been talking to minorities in places
where Republican presidential hopefuls rarely venture. His message
varies little from one place to the next as he stresses the
importance of loving families, of the sustenance of faith, and of
the need to give access to the American dream for ``every willing
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats eye these travels _ from Cleveland to Detroit to East
Los Angeles and points in-between _ with annoyance and skepticism.
Political analysts view Bush's outreach to African Americans and
Latinos as nothing more than an attempted bank shot for
independent, swing voters.
</P>
<P>
   But that sort of speculation doesn't bother Bush, who seems
genuinely moved as he listens to stories of drug-addicted dads, of
children abandoned at birth, and of welfare moms leaving the
government dole behind.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, at a program called ``Faith Works,'' the subject was
fatherhood and the small and intimate audience was African
American. The private group specializes in helping men who are drug
addicted or just out of prison to straighten out, find work and
return to their families as a bread-winner and role model.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Bush said, people need ``to remind Dads that one of
the most important responsibilities is to love your child with all
your heart and all your soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most important job any of us will have who are
blessed to be a Dad,'' he continued. ``The responsibility is
showing up and holding your daughters and holding your sons, and of
reminding them that if they aim high and make the right choices,
America is meant for them.''
</P>
<P>
   At at time when 25 million American children -- four out of ten
kids -- live in homes without fathers, Bush proposed a modest
initiative to try to reverse the trend. He would ask Congress for
$200 million over five years to give grants to faith-based and
community organizations that try to strengthen the role of fathers
in the lives of their families.
</P>
<P>
   The money could be used to help unemployed or low-income fathers
leave welfare by providing job training, subsidized employment and
education. It could be used to promote better parenting and
strengthen marriages through mentoring and classes. And the funds
would also go toward a national campaign marketing the virtues of
fatherhood.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's relatively low-key proposals and his geographical choices
for campaign stops don't always go over well in the community.
</P>
<P>
   State Representative Antonio Riley, a Milwaukee Democrat,
branded Bush's visit a photo opportunity rather than a substantive
attempt to alleviate the myriad problems of the inner city.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to Governor Bush, he likes to talk the talk, but
he doesn't like to walk the walk,'' said Riley, who is African
American. ``His concept of compassionate conservatism is one of
rhetoric, but not substance.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin Senator Gwendolynne Moore, the chairman of the Black
and Hispanic Caucus, is even harsher in her assessment of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a great deal of suffering,'' said Moore, of the
poor neighborhoods in this old industrial city. She calls Bush
``paternalistic,'' and says he is offering up ``platitudes,'' not
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very well-meaning people who can serve a handful of
folks with the crumbs from the master's table, while at the same
time the master is redistributing wealth away from poor children to
everybody else,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But others see Bush's efforts as smart politics, and a way to
sharply differentiate himself from the Republican Congress that is
viewed unfavorably in much of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many years, the right and left in the United States has
been defined at least in part by race,'' said David Bositis, senior
political analyst at the Joint Center for Political and Economic
Studies in Washington. ``Someone who appears to be reaching out to
minorities seems more left than right.''
</P>
<P>
   And that means that Bush would appear to be more moderate by
reaching out to minorities, and therefore more attractive to
middle-of-the-road swing voters, he said. ``It's not aimed at
African American voters,'' said Bositis, who noted that the vast
majority of blacks vote for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bush traced the recent pattern in his campaign to
his personal belief that while government has a role in
revitalizing downtrodden communities it is the people themselves _
people he likes to call the armies of compassion _ who can
transform souls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us in positions of responsiblity must not only uphold
the responsibility of the position, but must keep in mind how best
to change society,'' said Bush. ``And it's one heart at a time. And
that's why I'm here. This message goes beyond Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully,'' he continued, ``others are listening and will
rise up and say, `` `I can help, too.' ''

PROPOSED BRITISH LAW WOULD ENABLE GOVERNMENT TO MONITOR PRIVATE
E-MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   By SARAH LYALL  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ As the Clinton administration formally enters the
debate about law enforcement surveillance in cyberspace, the
British government is about to enact a law that would give the
authorities here broad powers to intercept and decode e-mail
messages and other communications between companies, organizations
and individual citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which goes further than the U.S. plan unveiled on
Monday in Washington, would make Britain the only Western democracy
where the government could require anyone using the Internet to
turn over the keys to decoding e-mails and other data encrypted for
secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   Such a measure would be an important tool for the government
because data is increasingly being encrypted for reasons of
security and privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a barrage of criticism from all sides, the bill is
likely to become law as it passes through its final stage in the
House of Lords and returns to the House of Commons next week,
because the Labor government, which offered the plan, holds a wide
majority in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials maintain that the measure is essential if
law enforcement agencies are to combat the sort of sophisticated
modern crime that is enhanced by access to the Internet, including
pedophilia, drug smuggling, money laundering, terrorism and
trafficking in refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The powers in the bill are necessary and proportionate to the
threat posed by 21st century criminals, no more, no less,'' said
Charles Clarke, the home office minister, last week.
</P>
<P>
   But the measure has had a rocky time in Parliament, where
lawmakers have vehemently objected to several provisions, including
one that would give the government new powers to require Internet
service providers to install ``black box'' surveillance systems
that would sort and send a range of data and e-mail to a monitoring
center controlled by Britain domestic security service, MI5.
</P>
<P>
   Such systems are also being used in the United States by the
FBI, where the technology is known as ``Carnivore'' because it is
able to extract the ``meat'' quickly from vast quantities of e-mail
messages and other communications between computers.
</P>
<P>
   But one major difference in the British measure is that the
authorities here would be able to require companies to install and
maintain the black boxes at their own expense and according to
technological specifications set out by the government.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, to justify such surveillance, the authorities would
not be obligated to take elaborate steps to persuade an independent
arbiter like a court that a crime had probably been committed. In
contrast to the United States, the British authorities have had a
tradition of unfettered and often uncontested intrusion into
citizens' privacy,
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the FBI must first obtain a search warrant
before using the Carnivore technology, which is then installed and
maintained by the bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to turn over a decryption key or to convert encrypted
data or messages into plain text could result in a two-year prison
sentence. Although many nations are considering similar bills to
deal with encrypted data, only Singapore and Malaysia have so far
enacted them.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would allow the British government to tap into
and monitor electronic communication for a host of broad reasons,
including to protect national security, to ``safeguard the
country's well-being,'' and to prevent and detect serious crime.
That last, far-reaching category might include, for instance, ``a
large number of persons in pursuit of a common purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure would not require traditional warrants, signed by
judges, in every instance. Instead, warrants for e-mail
surveillance could be issued by a swath of authorities throughout
every government agency, from the home secretary, who controls a
range of domestic and legal matters, to police officials
investigating criminal activity. In some cases, like the
surveillance of a user's Internet traffic pattern showing which Web
sites have been viewed and with whom e-mails have been exchanged,
no warrants would be required.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of this part of the bill ``can justifiably be
described as mass surveillance of Internet activities without
judicial warrant or adequate oversight,'' according to a report
prepared for the British Chambers of Commerce by a team of
professors at the London School of Economics and University College
London. ``The bill substantially increases the power of public
authorities without correspondingly increasing the scope for
oversight and accountability,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the measure in Britain represent an extraordinarily
diverse interests, ranging from trade unions and Amnesty
International to representatives of big business and newspapers
from across the political spectrum. Not only does the bill violate
basic civil liberties, they argue, but it would also impose onerous
costs on Internet service providers, subject them to
anti-competitive restraints, and drive business out of Britain
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Big Brother government realizing that unless they get
their act together, technology is going to make them impotent by
allowing individuals to bypass the regulations, and the spies, of
the state,'' said Ian Angell, professor of information systems at
the London School of Economics and a consultant on the recent
report.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a supporter of the police, and I believe they should be
given powers, but there has to be due process, and this bill
doesn't provide that,'' Angell said. ``They'll be allowed to go on
fishing expeditions.''

   It is not yet clear how how much the measure will cost. The
government has put aside 20 million pounds, or about $30 million,
to help businesses set up the new technology, but as it stands now,
Internet service providers themselves would bear the bulk of the
costs of the ``black boxes'' themselves. This provision is roughly
akin to asking ``manufacturers to pay for the police cars the Home
Office provides to the police,'' said William Roebuck, an executive
on the legal advisory group at the E-Center, a trade association
that studies standards and practices in e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The London School of Economics report estimated that the measure
would cost British business some 640 million pounds, or $960
million, over the next five years, a figure that could rise to 46
billion, or $69 billion, when opportunity costs and losses from the
economy are included. But Roebuck said it was impossible to tell
what the final figure would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Internet service providers are made to take on board the
costs, then the costs will be put through to the consumer,'' he
said. ``What's going to happen is that companies are going to
reroute everything away from the U.K. and take their business
abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies that have already said the measure would
make them reluctant to do business here is Poptel, one of Britain's
oldest Internet service providers. Poptel serves the noncommercial
sector _ charities, trade unions, lobbying organizations and the
like _ and many of its members have serious concerns about the
implications of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of our users who come into quite legitimate
conflict with the government,'' said Shaun Fensom, Poptel's
chairman, who said he might transfer some of the company's
operations offshore. ``They are concerned that the government could
classify some of their legitimate activity as being snoopable. My
feeling is that they will want access to at least some kind of
secure e-mail facility.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics are charging that the measure has been sloppily and
hastily drawn up for the purpose of giving the government as broad
latitude as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this does is contravene a large number of fundamental
rights in the European convention on human rights and other
international standards, which include not only the right to
privacy, the right to liberty, the right to freedom of expression
and the right to freedom of association,'' said Halya Gowan, a
researcher at Amnesty International in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a human rights organization, our work is based on the
confidentiality of statements we take from opponents of governments
around the world who are possibly victims of human rights
violations by these governments,'' she said. ``But under this bill,
we won't be able to guarantee confidentiality any more.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure, known as the Regulation of Investigatory Powers
Bill, or RIP, is an effort to extend a 1985 law setting out the
government's powers to intercept and monitor communications across
telephone lines to a host of modern technologies, including e-mail,
Web sites, pagers and cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, said Roebuck of the E-Center, the government has
already quietly been doing many of the things it will now be
legally allowed to do. ``They've already been doing covert
surveillance, covertly intercepting e-mail,'' he said. ``This gives
them a legal basis to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   And the government agrees, in effect, saying it is merely
setting out in law the parameters for what it has been doing
informally anyway. ``The bill is an important one which does not
substantially increase the powers available to the law enforcement
and security agencies but will make the U.K. a better and safer
place to live for all,'' Clarke told The Daily Telegraph.
</P>
<P>
   Some groups say that although they disagree with the nuts and
bolts of the bill, they are encouraged by the fact that the
government is, at last, trying to establish a legal framework for
its surveillance activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, people should welcome the bill because it provides
some kind of system of accountability for interferences with
privacy where there hasn't been in the past,'' said John Wadham,
the director of Liberty, a civil liberties group. ``At the moment,
the law related to employers listening in to your telephone is very
vague and not regulated. Now it will be unlawful to interfere with
privacy except in particular circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is not good enough, said Conor Gearty, a professor of
human rights law at King's College London, who takes a dim view of
such backdoor legislating. ``The British authorities have a history
of engaging in activities outside the law which inflict on people's
privacy or otherwise affect their liberties, and then suddenly
saying that the time has come to bring the law into line with
practice,'' he said.

COUNTERSUIT FILED IN CANCER TREATMENT RESEARCH CASE 
</HEADLINE>

 By RAJA MISHRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In an escalation of a high-stakes scientific struggle,
prominent cancer researcher Dr. Judah Folkman and Children's
Hospital Tuesday countersued drug giant Abbott Laboratories Inc.
for fraud and defamation, accusing the Illinois company of
resorting to lies and threats in attempting to steal a potential
blockbuster cancer discovery.
</P>
<P>
   The scorching 47-page legal attack files in US District Court
Tuesday was a response to Abbott's May 30 lawsuit accusing
Folkman's lab of a ``conspiracy'' to falsely claim credit for
discovering a substance that could save lives by starving cancerous
tumors to death.
</P>
<P>
   The dueling lawsuits are a nasty byproduct of the
hyper-competitive world of cancer research, where a discovery of a
single molecule can be worth billions and a cure is perhaps the
most sought-after prize in all medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Tumor starving is seen as the most promising avenue of cancer
research and Folkman is its acknowledged father. He has become an
almost messianic figure among cancer patients, half a million of
whom die every year in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The ongoing trials of the cancer drugs stemming from his work
are among the most-watched in a generation. None of the current
trials are affected by the lawsuits. But Tuesday, Children's
alleged that Abbott's legal attack could slow future discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   The case ``has cast a cloud over Children's and the individual
scientists, jeopardizing their ability to obtain funding for their
research activities and forcing them to expend valuable time,
energy and resources to respond to the defamatory statements,''
stated Children's in its court filing.
</P>
<P>
   The heavily publicized Abbott lawsuit personally devastated
Folkman, said colleagues. His lawyers promised _ and delivered _ a
strongly worded response.
</P>
<P>
   The legal back-and-forth has been unusually personal for the
otherwise staid world of patent law. Tuesday's filing upped the
ante, adding a defamation of character charge to the already
complex scientific dispute, claiming Abbott devised a ``malicious
campaign to intimidate and harass'' the Children's researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abbott sees some very valuable technology. They tried to get
it fairly and legitimately and they couldn't,'' said Children's
lead lawyer William F. Lee. ``What they've done now is threaten
unfairly the thing that's most important to Dr. Folkman and
Children's _ their reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Abbott maintained Tuesday it was the sole discoverer of the
tumor-starving breakthrough in question and would continue to make
its case in court. It has 20 days to respond to Tuesday's
counter-suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since our proprietary intellectual property is at the heart of
our ability to fulfill our mission, we must vigorously defend our
rights to our discovery,'' said Abbott spokeswoman Ann
Fahey-Widman.
</P>
<P>
   After Abbott responds, the case will enter a phase where the
scientists can be questioned under oath and documents can be
subpoenaed, though the two sides have already exchanged significant
sheafs of information in the three years of failed negotiations
that preceded the legal clash.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy boils down to a scientific whodunit: who knew
what when?
</P>
<P>
   It centers on a protein called plasminogen found in blood.
Plasminogen is divided into five regions dubbed ``Kringles.''
</P>
<P>
   Undisputed is that Folkman's lab discovered the anti-tumor
potential of the first four Kringles, publishing its results in a
series of mid-1990s groundbreaking papers.
</P>
<P>
   Tumors thrive by creating their own blood vessels in a process
called angiogenesis, a discovery that is Folkman's signature
insight. His lab established that Kringles 1-4 could shut down the
process in mice, a finding that electrified the medical world.
</P>
<P>
   But Abbott, in its lawsuit, claims its own researcher, Dr.
Donald Davidson, is the discoverer of the anti-tumor potential of
Kringle 5. Davidson is an expert on plasminogen. According to court
documents, in early 1994 Folkman's lab requested supplies of
plasminogen from three sources: Notre Dame University,
Carnegie-Mellon University and Davidson's lab at Abbott. Abbott was
not engaged in any tumor-starving research at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott claims that, at this time, Davidson began his own Kringle
5 studies and found _ for the first time _ that properly treated
Kringle 5 had stronger anti-tumor properties than Kringles 1 to 4.
He told Folkman's lab about it and they ran off with the idea
straight to the patent office, claims Abbott.
</P>
<P>
   Children's Tuesday argued that Dr. Yihai Cao, then a researcher
in Folkman's lab, made the Kringle 5 discovery on his own. Cao was
able to draw on two decades worth of research in Folkman's lab,
noted Children's lawyers, while Davidson was a cancer research
neophyte.
</P>
<P>
   Cao published his findings in the Journal of Biological
Chemistry, sending a draft to Davidson. In a recent interview, Cao
maintained he made the discovery on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don Davidson never published his data. He never showed any of
it to me,'' said Cao. ``I know I created this idea in my brain. I
know what I was thinking, I know what I planned. I know what I
did.''
</P>
<P>
   During a recent interview at his suburban Chicago home, Davidson
said he could not elaborate on the lawsuit because Abbott placed
him under a gag order two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides sought patents on Kringle 5's cancer fighting
properties. The US Patent Office approved both. In fact, clashing
patents are not uncommon and usually settled in court. In that
regard, this case is typical. Abbott is asking that Children's
patent be rescinded; Children's is requesting the reverse.
</P>
<P>
   What is unusual is the angry rhetoric leveled by both sides,
with Abbott accusing Children's of being ``engaged in a scheme'' to
steal the discovery. Tuesday, Children's responded by alleging
Abbott's lawsuit was calculated to ``damage the good reputation''
of Children's and its scientists and ``intimidate them'' into
relinquishing credit for their work.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman's colleagues have said he is depressed by the case,
worried that a black mark will always appear next to his otherwise
brilliant resume. Cao, recently speaking from Stockholm where he is
researcher at the Karolinska Institute, said the Scandinavian
scientific community is abuzz with talk of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has upset me and my family, too. You try to help other
people and other people try to bite you back. It makes you wonder
why you do it,'' he said. ``I'm just starting my career at the age
of 40. I have a long way to go. I don't want to damage it.''
</P>
<P>
   The bitter legal fight may have years to go but the tests on the
tumor starving drugs pioneered by Folkman's lab _ called
angiogenesis inhibitors _ continue to plow ahead.
</P>
<P>
   One drug, Endostatin, is undergoing Phase 1 testing at the
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and two centers elsewhere,
to see if it is safe to take.
</P>
<P>
   Another drug Angiostatin, is further along, having recently
started initial human testing at Thomas Jefferson University in
Philadelphia. Although the entire cancer community is intensely
interested in the outcomes, no results have yet been released.

INDICTED EX-PRESIDENT OF ECUADOR DEFENDS ACTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Deposed Ecuadorean President Jamil Mahuad, who faces
arrest warrants issued last week by his nation's top court,
defended Tuesday the decisions that sparked the charges against
him.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released by Harvard University, where he has been
teaching, Mahuad said that a three-member team of lawyers will
represent him in upcoming proceedings before Ecuador's Supreme
Court, but did not indicate whether he would return to face the
charges himself. He said would make no further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Mahuad said the decisions cited by the court were necessary to
stabilize a national banking and finance system that was rapidly
collapsing.
</P>
<P>
   Mahuad, who was ousted by Ecuador's military in January, became
a visiting fellow at Harvard University's Kennedy School of
Government in April and will remain at the school through the
summer working on projects that neither he nor the school has
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ecuador was facing its worst crisis in the last 70 years,'' he
said in the prepared statement. ``It had become the most indebted
country in Latin America in regard to its GDP (gross domestic
product). It had the worst inflation in South America. . . . The
financial system was broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a consequence of these problems, capital flight took $500
million out of the country in three months,'' he said, and for that
reason the government decided to freeze broad areas of the banking
sector ``to stop the bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics and the supreme court judge leading the investigation
allege that Mahuad exceeded his constitutional authority and
possibly engaged in corrupt behavior by helping banking-sector
leaders, but the former president said ``all our actions were in
good faith.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I affected the lives of many people with these
decisions,'' he said, ``but my main goal was to prevent the wealthy
people from taking money out of the country. Of course I made
mistakes, but it was very difficult to govern during such a
crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   The monetary crisis and his decision to freeze deposits were
subjects of a study group on Ecuador which he led at the Kennedy
School.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the fall of 1998, Christian Haye, a New York poet
and art critic, opened a gallery of contemporary art in Manhattan.
He called it the Project and presented an impressive lineup of
artists from the Americas, Europe, Africa and Asia, many of them
making local solo gallery debuts. Among them was Paul Pfeiffer, who
went on to become a star of this year's Whitney Biennial and the
recipient of that museum's first $100,000 Bucksbaum Award,
currently the world's largest award for a visual artist.
</P>
<P>
   In a city where competition for attention-grabbing talent is
keen, the Project seemed to be on a winning track. But it was also
bucking serious odds, New York has hundreds of art galleries; they
open and fold all the time. Start-up backing can ensure at least
short-term survival; Haye had none. And if prime location is
everything, his venture had a major handicap. It wasn't situated
within one of Manhattan's downtown art precincts. It was in a
former disco on West 126th Street in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Haye's solution was to turn being out of the way into a mark of
distinction. ``Everything about his gallery is a surprise,'' said
Thelma Golden, deputy director for exhibitions and programs at the
nearby Studio Museum in Harlem. ``On the block it blends into the
other buildings. Then you go inside and see the poured concrete
floors and white Sheetrock walls. He shows international artists
where you might expect to find only African-American artists. He
brings a contemporary art world sensibility, but he's also deeply
invested in the neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   What inspired Haye to open his gallery in Harlem? ``In a sense,
Chelsea,'' he said in a recent interview. He was referring to the
city's now-not-so-new commercial art center in the far West 20s, in
recent years a bleak stretch of storage buildings and garages until
its overnight transformation into what some people see as an
instant art mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be in a neighborhood with some history,'' Haye
said. ``SoHo was over. Williamsburg was already taken. Harlem was
the natural choice. The area is overly politicized and has always
been an economic battleground. But no place has more narrative than
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Art has always been part of that narrative. Legendary figures
like Aaron Douglas, Augusta Savage and Jacob Lawrence once lived in
Harlem. High-profile contemporary artists like Ghada Amer, David
Hammons and Nari Ward work in the area today. The Studio Museum,
established in 1968, has a worldwide reputation as a center for
African-American culture and is now expanding its physical plant
and its programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``My great-grandmother came from Barbados to live here many
years ago,'' said Haye, 30. ``I've done a lot of traveling, and
anywhere you go in the world people say: `You're from New York. Are
you from Harlem?' Everybody knows about it, though almost as if it
were a virtual space. They don't know what the reality of it is.''
</P>
<P>
   That reality is notably upbeat at the moment. A commercial
renovation is changing the face of 125th Street, bringing in
Starbucks and Disney and with them presumably more visitors,
including tourists. All of this may benefit the Project itself,
which in February moved to new quarters a few doors from its
original site after the ex-disco, on which Haye had a
month-to-month lease, was sold to a social services agency.
</P>
<P>
   The forced move was just one more learning experience for Haye,
with little cash and almost no experience in running a gallery.
Born in Queens County, raised on Long Island, he enrolled at New
York University when he was 16 to study comparative literature but
dropped out fast. ``I had problems with academia,'' he said.
``There's something about the power structure between students and
teachers that doesn't work for me.''
</P>
<P>
   He worked in publishing, then as a receptionist at The New York
Review of Books. ``Even when I was a teen-ager all I ever wanted to
do was sit down and read and write book reviews,'' he said. He
became briefly involved in the Nuyorican Poets Cafe in the East
Village after hearing Amiri Baraka read there, and got a job with
the Jack Tilton Gallery in SoHo, though that didn't last long. ``I
just don't play well with others,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While at Tilton, he was living in the East Village in an
apartment above the poet Steve Cannon, who had founded the literary
and art magazine Gathering of the Tribes. Haye edited two issues
and started writing about pop culture for other magazines like Bomb
and Frieze, a contemporary art journal published in London.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 exasperated by what he viewed as misguided critical
responses to black artists (and upset with the provocative ``Black
Male'' show at the Whitney, organized by Golden and which he
considered wrongheaded), he turned his attention to art criticism.
``I thought, `Well, I'm not an art critic, but I'm sick of reading
this stuff.' Then I found myself writing more and more about art,
which isn't what I set out to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He spent the next three years traveling, mostly in Europe,
networking intensively and looking at work in art fairs and
biennials as well as in institutional programs. ``I basically
opened a gallery to show artists I'd been wanting to write about,''
he said. So far, he added, no artist he has invited to show with
him has turned him down.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   After scouting around Harlem, he found the abandoned disco. With
the help of friends, he put up interior walls on the first floor
himself. He decided to use the basement as additional exhibition
space, leaving it more or less as he found it with tropical
landscapes picked out in glitter on black-painted walls.
</P>
<P>
   No one who visited the Project that year is likely to forget it.
There was no heat. And when a midwinter installation by the
Scandinavian artist team of Michael Elmgreen and Ingar Dragset
entailed knocking a hole through the wall of the building, the
inside temperature was biting.
</P>
<P>
   Usually two solo shows were on view at a time; the mix was
visually varied and conceptually unprogrammatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The early 1990s was an ideological time,'' he said. ``It was
the message, not the medium that mattered. Now the pendulum seems
to have swung the other way, and I guess I'm swinging with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Young artists like Bulent Sangar from Turkey and the Korean-born
Kim Sooja (much noticed at last year's Venice Biennale) appeared
along with maverick Americans rarely seen in New York, like the
performance artist William Pope L., who a few years ago tied
himself to the door of a midtown bank with a string of hot dogs and
handed out money, and the California-based Daniel J. Martinez,
known for the ``I can't imagine ever wanting to be white''
admission tags he designed for the 1993 Whitney Biennial.
</P>
<P>
   The final show in the space was work by Romuald Hazoume from
Benin, who arrived a month before the opening to collect local
materials for his sculptures. It was Hazoume's first visit to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The third day he was here,'' Haye recalled, ``he said to me:
`Christian, this is really strange. I've met so many people from
Benin here. And I don't have to speak English. I can just speak
French all day.' I said: `Well, this is Harlem. What do you
expect?'''
</P>
<P>
   After that show closed last July, the gallery was homeless for
several months until its reappearance at 427 West 126th Street, a
compact two-story former bar. Haye has also brought in a new
director and partner, Jenny Liu, whose background is almost as
varied as his. A Harvard Law School graduate with a background in
linguistics and psychology, she has a degree in art history from
the Institute of Fine Arts in New York and has worked as an
assistant director at 303 Gallery in Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition program continues to be lively. On view through
Aug. 27 are the sound-based installations by Nadine Robinson and
Stephen Vitiello, both of whom made strong impressions in the
``Greater New York'' exhibition at P.S. 1 this spring. (Through the
summer the gallery will officially be open only on Sundays, 12 to 6
p.m., though Haye and Liu are often on the premises and welcome
drop-in visits.)
</P>
<P>
   September will bring a show Haye describes as ``devoted mostly
to pornography,'' with work by Shu Lea Cheang and Matthias Vriens,
creative director of Gucci. Two young California artists, Art
Domantay and Kori Newkirk, will follow. Pfeiffer is being given
both floors of the gallery for a solo in November.
</P>
<P>
   The gallery has attracted some backing since it opened, but, Liu
said with a mild note of wonder, it largely supports itself through
sales, which have recently ranged from a $400 drawing to a $100,000
installation. Openings are well attended and foot traffic has
picked up.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning we got maybe two people a day,'' she said.
``Now we sometimes have 15 or 20, which is nothing at all for
Chelsea but a lot for here.''
</P>
<P>
   Liu and Haye have high hopes for the expansion of the
contemporary gallery scene in the neighborhood, which also includes
two spaces that predate the Project's arrival and share its broad
agenda: Gallery X at 23 West 129th Street and the nonprofit Gallery
M at 123 West 135th Street. ``We keep hearing rumors that other
galleries are moving up here,'' Golden said, ``and if they do it
will be because of what Christian has done. His energy is
infectious.''
</P>
<P>
   But Haye, who lives in an apartment near the Project, says he
wonders whether the mainstream downtown art world will really
follow his lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I run into people from the New York art world all the time in
Europe,'' he said. ``They can find their way to Berlin, but they
can't find their way to Harlem because it's too far away. It's not
really about the distance, though. It's about mental image. People
still ask me if it's safe here. It's so close to where a lot of
people are, but it's a different world.''

GEPHARDT TAKES HIMSELF OFF GORE'S SHORT LIST _ SORT OF 
</HEADLINE>
  By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt took himself
off the list of possibilities for Vice President Al Gore's running
mate on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Or did he?
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference called to discuss tax bills, Gephardt, of
Missouri, who has been courted by the Gore camp in recent weeks,
said his priority was to stay put as the Democratic leader _ and
lead his party to retake control of the House. (And, he hopes,
become the next speaker.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said I don't want to do that,'' Gephardt said of the No.
2 job. ``And I've said I hope and believe they'll find someone to
do that other than me.''
</P>
<P>
   But, even as his aides insisted he had no interest in a spot on
the ticket, Gephardt left the door slightly ajar _ a point that was
noticed by Gore aides.
</P>
<P>
   What if the vice president put the squeeze on him, telling him
that he had to do it for the good of the party? Would Gephardt
change his mind?
</P>
<P>
   The congressman refused to answer, saying only, ``I've been as
clear as clear can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed at another point to ``say more firmly'' that he would
not join the ticket, he said, ``Well, I'm for Al Gore. You know
that. I have supported him from the beginning of this campaign,
almost. And I think he'd make a great president of this country.
And I hope that he wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt _ who had considered taking Gore on in the primaries
this year _ emphasized that his heart is on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been very focused on one thing, and that's winning back a
majority in the House,'' he said. ``I've worked very, very hard at
it, and I continue to work at it every day. And so I'm
preoccupied.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``That's the only reason that I wouldn't have a
different thought on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt's words must be examined carefully because there is a
history of vice presidential contenders insisting they do not want
the job. Sometimes they say that to appear virtuous, knowing they
will not get picked anyway. Other times, they say they do not want
it, but do not really mean it. Sometimes, of course, they may
really mean it but can be pressed into running anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Even the two Republicans who many party members say have the
most sizzle _ Colin Powell and Sen. John McCain of Ariz. _ left a
bit of maneuvering room when they ruled themselves out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a candidate for vice president,'' Powell said
recently.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said: ``I asked that I not be considered for vice
president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, voters should be reminded of what Sen. Al Gore of
Tennessee told Larry King on CNN in February of 1992: ``I have no
interest in being vice president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Daley, Gore's campaign chairman, explained the feint:
``People who say, `I have a much more important job. I'm in the
United States Senate.' Give me a break!'' Daley said in an
interview before he was plucked from Clinton's Cabinet to run the
campaign. ``This is the second most important job in the nation.''

CELLULAR PHONES TO CARRY RADIATION-LEVEL LABEL
</HEADLINE>
  By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Moving to ease concern over possible health risks
from mobile phones, the largest manufacturers of cellular
telephones are planning to disclose on their packages the radiation
levels emitted from the devices they sell.
</P>
<P>
   Under a proposal submitted by the Cellular Telephone Industry
Association, which represents several hundred wireless carriers and
manufacturers, cell phone manufacturers will begin on Aug. 1 to
seek the trade group's certification.
</P>
<P>
   According to guidelines established in 1996, cell phone
manufacturers already disclose the information to the Federal
Communications Commission, but it is not easily available to
consumers when they purchase the devices.
</P>
<P>
   Concern over the radiation levels of cell phones has grown as
the devices have increased in popularity, with the number of
cellular subscribers in the United States nearly tripling over five
years. While no link has been established between cell phone use
and cancer, the move is seen as protecting manufacturers from the
type of legal action that has recently shaken the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a smart, proactive move on their part,'' said Mitchell
Lazarus, a lawyer at Fletcher, Heald &AMP; Hindreth, a law firm based
in Arlington, Va., that specializes in the telecommunications
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Nokia of Finland, Ericsson of Sweden and Motorola
of Schaumberg, Ill., the three largest cell phone manufacturers,
will disclose the information, which is expected to appear on new
devices during the next three to six months.

 &HT;    Coca-Cola Enterprises reports big second-quarter profit
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Coca-Cola Enterprises reported Tuesday a big boost in
second-quarter profit, which benefited from a comparison with last
summer's product recall in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based CCE, the world's largest soft-drink bottler,
earned $122 million, or 29 cents a share. That compared with $33
million, or 8 cents a share, last year.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding one-time charges, the company beat analysts' estimates
by 2 cents a share, helping to boost its stock 94 cents Tuesday to
$18.44.
</P>
<P>
   CCE earned 30 cents a share in the second quarter, after
excluding a $12 million charge for restructuring operations in
Great Britain. That compared with 24 cents last year, not counting
the product recall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think CCE's numbers were solid in the second quarter,'' said
Andrew Conway, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``This
was among the more challenging quarters for CCE in a long time,
because they faced pricing and margin pressure in Great Britain and
lower case sales in North America. However, the strong pricing in
North America was able to add significantly to operating
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Cash operating profit, a key measure of a bottler's performance
that excludes interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, rose
21 percent to $696 million. CCE buys syrup or concentrate from
Coca-Cola Co. It then adds carbonated water before packaging the
beverages and distributing them to retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Case sales dropped 0.5 percent in North America, while shooting
up 15.5 percent in Europe, largely because of the comparison with
last year's recall there. In total, case sales rose 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their mission, should they choose to accept it, is to make
sure case-sales growth in the United States begins to pick up in
the last half of the year and strengthens further next year,'' said
Manny Goldman, an analyst with ING Barings. ``That's what counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Revenue rose 6 percent to $4.03 billion.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, CCE is expected to earn about 50 cents a share,
compared with 29 cents last year, excluding one-time charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we have more work ahead of us, we are successfully
establishing a more profitable foundation from which to build for
the long-term value of our shareowners,'' Chairman and Chief
Executive Summerfield Johnston Jr. said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the company has a ``below average'' recommendation
among Wall Street analysts, according to a survey by First
Call/Thomson Financial. Four analysts rate it a ``strong buy,''
three designate it as a ``buy,'' and eight classify it as a
``hold.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Co., which owns about 40 percent of CCE, is slated to
report its earnings today. Excluding one-time charges, analysts
expect it to report second-quarter earnings of 41 cents a share,
compared with 38 cents last year.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Coke has an ``average'' recommendation among
analysts, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Eight analysts
rate the stock as a ``strong buy,'' two consider it a ``buy'' and
six designate it as a ``hold.''

 &HT;    Woods prohibitive favorite to win British Open
 &HT;    By Craig Dolch
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ Tiger Woods has won a U.S. Open by 15
shots and a Masters by 12. He has won more than half of his last 22
tournaments (12), including six in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for his latest _ and perhaps greatest _ piece of magic.
</P>
<P>
   This week he will try to become just the fifth player _ and the
youngest _ to win the career grand slam. At 24 years, 7 months,
Woods is heavily favored to win the British Open at the Old Course
and join golf's most exclusive club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I would love to have that happen,'' Woods said.
``And there's no better site for it to occur than the home of golf.
It's a very special place. Every person who has ever played the
game of golf has wanted to win an Open at St. Andrews because
that's where the game evolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Ben Hogan and Gene Sarazen are
golf's version of the Fab Four, linked by their ability to win the
game's four most significant tournaments _ the Masters, U.S. Open,
British Open and PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   How difficult is it? Many have tried, but only those four have
succeeded. And nobody has done so since 1966.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're playing in four completely different environments,''
Player said Tuesday after playing a practice round with the other
living member of the club (Nicklaus). ``To win one major in your
life you can be pretty proud of. The odds of winning all four are
stacked against you.''
</P>
<P>
   Just consider some of the players who didn't win all four
majors: Arnold Palmer, Tom Watson, Byron Nelson, Sam Snead, Lee
Trevino Ray Floyd. Now Woods has that opportunity in just his
fourth full season as a professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be remarkable,'' said Watson, who like Palmer never
won the PGA. ``But given the way he's playing, it's not
surprising.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also not surprising that Woods again finds himself on a
parallel course with his childhood idol. When Nicklaus was 24, he
came to St. Andrews in 1964 with an opportunity to complete the
slam. Nicklaus finished second, five shots behind winner Tomy Lema,
and waited two years before he became the youngest to win all four
majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to deal with all kinds of conditions and you have
to be able to do a lot of different things,'' Nicklaus said.
``Certainly he (Woods) will, whether it be this year. This course
is certainly right down his alley.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods is listed as the prohibitive 15-8 favorite to win here,
thanks in large part to his 15-shot victory last month at the U.S.
Open at Pebble Beach. The rest of the field shoudn't be happy to
hear Woods' swing coach, Butch Harmon, say Woods is hitting the
ball better than he did at Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Woods surprised some Tuesday when he said he probably wouldn't
rate the career Grand Slam as his top achievement. Even more
surprising was the revelation he thinks winning three consecutive
U.S. Juniors is his greatest success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would rank up there,'' Woods said of the career grand slam.
``At the top? That's hard to say because I've had a lot of
wonderful accomplishments in my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Harmon didn't buy that. ``It would mean a lot to Tiger, because
he's always rated his success by how he rates against the great
players,'' Harmon said.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of the current grand slam has evolved in the last 40
years. In 1930, for instance, many believed Bobby Jones won the
Grand Slam when he was victorious in the U.S. Open and British
Open, as well as the U.S. Amateur and the British Amateur.
</P>
<P>
   But after Palmer won the Masters and U.S. Open in 1960,
sportswriter Bob Drum first wrote about Palmer's chances of winning
the modern grand slam. The idea stuck and almost retroactively,
Sarazen and Hogan became members of the club they had earned
entrance to decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Others came so very close to joining them. Had Snead parred the
par-5 18th hole at Phildaelphia Country Club in the 1939 U.S. Open,
he would have won the career slam. Instead, he made triple-bogey
and missed the playoff by two shots. Snead also had four runner-up
finishes in the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something always seemed to happen,'' Snead said Monday. ``I
would step in a hole or someone would kick my ball.''
</P>
<P>
   His frustration was shared by Palmer and Watson. ``I freely
admit that I would have dearly loved to have won the PGA,''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer said. ``It would have been important for me to win it and
put the missing jewel in my crown. It bothers me that I didn't win
it, but it doesn't prey on my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Watson: ``I had several opportunities, but I also won some
majors I probably shouldn't have. I don't complain about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the active players, only Woods, Nick Price, Vijay Singh,
John Daly, Nick Faldo, Sandy Lyle and Mark O'Meara have won two
different majors, with Singh the most likely to make a run at the
career slam. Singh has the work ethic,
</P>
<P>
   but Player wonders if he was almost ordained to join the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is to win it, I don't think the man can take the
credit for it,'' he said. ``It's a special gift from upstairs.''

GORE PROMOTES CRIME-FIGHTING PACKAGE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTY REINERT 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. _ Vice President Al Gore passed out hugs and
listened to the stories of crime victims Tuesday as he kicked off a
three-day trip spotlighting his planned $685 million, 10-year
crime-fighting package.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one should have to go through what you've been through,''
Gore told victims gathered at Rhodes College.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic presidential candidate first announced his Crime
Victims Bill of Rights proposal last year. It would use money from
the federal budget surplus to increase compensation for crime
victims, provide temporary housing for women trying to escape
domestic violence and crack down on hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Central to the plan is a constitutional amendment that calls for
giving victims the right to be heard during the sentencing process,
to be notified when prisoners are released and to receive
restitution from their offenders. Several states already offer
those protections, but Gore said about 60 percent of victims of
violent crimes are not notified of their right to participate in
prosecution, sentencing or corrections decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defendants have constitutional rights to protect them, and
when those rights are enshrined in the Constitution and the rights
of victims are not, whenever the two come into conflict, victims
are put in the back seat and sometimes completely ignored,'' Gore
said. ``We need to change that by having balance in the system.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Gore expanded his plan to include legislation aimed
at protecting the jobs of crime victims who need time off work to
attend trials. Modeled after the federal Family and Medical Leave
Act, Gore's plan would allow crime victims to take unpaid leave
from work without putting their jobs or promotions in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan also calls for increasing the amount of funds that
can be paid out of the federal Crime Victims Fund, encouraging
Congress to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, and
restoring a provision that gave victims of gender-motivated
violence the power to sue their attackers for lost earnings,
medical expenses and other damages. Gore also would offer 4,000 new
temporary housing vouchers to help provide safe housing for women
and children escaping abusive homes.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Clinton-Gore administration, which has increased the
number of police officers on the street, imposed tougher penalties
for some crimes and funded more crime prevention programs, crime
has fallen nationwide to its lowest level in 25 years. Serious
crime has decreased for eight consecutive years, and the murder
rate is now at its lowest point since 1967, Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore was immediately criticized by Republican rival George
W. Bush and Republicans lawmakers who accused the vice president of
playing election-year politics by supporting a victims' rights
amendment after the White House opposed a bipartisan victims'
rights amendment just a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jon Kyl, an Arizona Republican and a chief sponsor of the
measure, charged that Gore had been AWOL (absent without leave)
from the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly one year ago, Al Gore said he would lead the fight for
victims' rights, and then we didn't hear from him,'' Kyl told The
Associated Press in a conference telephone call that the Bush
campaign helped arrange.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said the administration opposed
Kyl's legislation because of prosecutors' concerns that it would
interfere with defendants' rights to a speedy trial, giving
criminals another avenue to appeal their convictions. Lehane said
Gore's plan addresses technical problems with the previous
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   After a quick visit with Memphis police and with children
attending summer camp in Memphis, Gore spent the afternoon with
crime victims before flying to Kansas City, Mo., to greet
supporters there on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   For the second day in a row, Gore attacked Bush's Social
Security plan, warning that it would put the system into a deficit
for the first time in its 65-year history. He challenged Bush to
justify and explain the plan, which he believes will cost taxpayers
$3 trillion.

`MISSISSIPPI': A PENT-UP OLD MAN RIVER RUN AMOK 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Broadcast notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for

<P>
   There are those people who wake up to the weather report and
those who don't. The Weather Channel thrives because so many of us
do, and the History Channel has noticed. So beginning Wednesday
night, History begins its ``Wrath of God'' series, which features
natural disasters, many of them meteorological, and all historic of
course.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every other Wednesday night at 11, through the end of the
year, weather-disaster buffs can have a nightcap of typhoons,
hurricanes, avalanches and floods. The series begins with
``Mississippi: River Out of Control,'' about the flood of 1927 that
killed 500 to 1,000 people and left almost one million more
homeless. Children of the region would grow up hearing their
parents date everything ``before the flood'' and ``after the
flood.''
</P>
<P>
   Produced and written by Ginny Weissman, this sober and
informative program offers a no-nonsense account of nature's
response to human hubris. Southern plantation owners needed to be
near the river to transport cotton, the region's big cash crop. The
levees they built to control flooding also built pressure in the
contained water after a big rain. In April 1927, there were many
big rains _ 15 inches fell on New Orleans in one 18-hour period _
and the levees burst. It was like a balloon popping, says one of
the documentary's historian-commentators, and the water poured out
like escaping air.
</P>
<P>
   We learn that at its peak the river zoomed along at 3 million
cubic feet a second, double the volume of water that cascades over
Niagara Falls. The Bible and Shakespeare describe the futility of
man trying to circumvent nature more poetically, but the History
Channel delivers good pictures. The documentary shows families
paddling boats up a town's main street, eye to eye with chimneys.
One man fashioned what could be called Noah's barge, a kind of
floating pen for his farm animals. We see the refugee tent camps
constructed after the flood, eerily prescient of the Depression
tent camps.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert Hoover, secretary of commerce under President Calvin
Coolidge, emerges cleanly for his sensitive handling of the
post-flood trauma. But there was plenty of insensitivity, even
brutality. Local police officers rounded up convicts to stuff and
pile sandbags on the levees. The convicts were joined in this
dangerous work by black farm workers, who had been ordered to the
riverfront by their employers. These workers were the first to bear
the brunt of the flood when the banks overflowed _ many drowned _
and the last to leave the refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary explains the political maneuvering that saved
New Orleans, by washing out her smaller neighbors. As the flood
moved south from Greenville, Miss., New Orleans politicians and
businessmen persuaded Louisiana's governor to divert the flood to
neighboring parishes, which were much less populated. Their deal
included payments of $20 a person for the displaced country folks.
</P>
<P>
   Much like their ancestors who gathered on hills to watch Civil
War battles, many New Orleans residents went to watch the explosion
upriver that would destroy the levees and change the Mississippi's
course. The sacrificial towns were destroyed as planned, and their
people never received the promised reparations.
</P>
<P>
   A man who was a boy then recalls going back into his home after
the flood: ``Oh, mud was everywhere _ and stink.'' But the terrible
vision of the flood also contained ``an awful beauty,'' says one
commentator, that lingers for historians, archaeologists,
memoirists, filmmakers and disaster buffs.

GM CHANGES SALES DISCOUNTS AND ANNOUNCES PROFITS ARE SLIGHTLY UP 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ General Motors on Tuesday revamped its sales discounts
for the third quarter, while announcing that its profits had inched
up in the second quarter instead of falling slightly, as had been
expected.
</P>
<P>
   GM raised its rebates by $500 on a wide range of cars, minivans,
sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. But the company also
increased the lowest available interest rates on its discounted
auto loans, to 3.9 percent from 0.9 percent. Recent interest rate
increases by the Federal Reserve have made it prohibitively
expensive for automakers to continue subsidizing deeply discounted
loans.
</P>
<P>
   The Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler AG changed its incentives
last month to emphasize rebates at the expense of auto loans, while
Ford Motor Co. quietly did so earlier this month on a limited
basis. But neither program was as generous in rebates as the deals
GM made available to its dealers Tuesday, which took effect
immediately and will last through Oct. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Because less-affluent buyers tend to choose auto loans while
those with greater wealth tend to prefer rebates, the shift away
from auto loans is likely to drive some less-prosperous customers
out of the auto market, cooling overall sales and slowing the
economy slightly, auto executives said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are the Fed actions having an impact in terms of how we're
taking our vehicles to market? I would say yes,'' said Kevin E.
Costello, Ford Motor's finance director for North American
marketing and revenue analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Costly incentives in the second quarter had led many investors
and some Wall Street analysts to fear that GM would post weak
financial results Tuesday. But the company's net income from
continuing operations ended up rising 1 percent, to $1.75 billion
from $1.73 billion a year earlier. Its earnings per share jumped
10.2 percent, to $2.93 from $2.66. That is largely because nearly
two months ago GM reduced the number of its shares, by offering
shareholders in exchange some of its Class H shares, which track
the earnings of its Hughes Electronics subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Financial analysts had forecast that GM would earn $2.82 a
share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. The company
outperformed the estimates because its revenue from each vehicle
stayed flat despite increasing discounts, analysts said. This was
possible partly because customers ordered more optional equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people are buying leather seats, more people are buying
sun roofs,'' J. Michael Losh, GM's chief financial officer, said in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
   GM announced its earnings before the opening bell on the New
York Stock Exchange Tuesday, while word of its new incentives did
not dribble out until after the close of trading. GM stock climbed
44 cents, to close at $60.81.
</P>
<P>
   Scott F. Merlis, an investment banker specializing in auto
companies at Wasserstein Perella Securities Inc., said that
financial markets had been expecting more harm to second-quarter
earnings from the discounts. ``The higher incentives are not
leading to a devastation of the bottom line,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ward, an auto analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said that
the stock market's muted reaction to GM's results, its best second
quarter ever for continuing operations, showed that investors were
paying little attention to auto stocks. ``The stock market doesn't
seem to care, but five years ago if we'd told people GM would have
a quarter like this, they'd have looked at us in disbelief,'' Ward
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Zarrella, the president of GM's North American
operations, said in a telephone conference call this morning with
analysts and journalists that the automaker's average price for
each vehicle after incentives would be down by roughly half a
percentage point for the full year despite flat prices in the
second quarter. He blamed competitive pressures. The average net
price fell 0.7 percent in the first quarter. It was unchanged in
the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   GM's automotive earnings shrank in North America and Europe
during the second quarter, dipping to $1.46 billion from $1.55
billion as the weakness of the euro and Canadian dollar made
profits in Europe and Canada worth less when converted into
American currency. Sales of less-profitable cars grew, while sales
of more profitable sport utility vehicles were little changed.
</P>
<P>
   Losses widened in East Asia, where GM's 49 percent stake in
Isuzu cost it $100 million. But GM's Latin American business, long
a money-spinner that fell on hard times two years ago became
profitable again, while some of the automaker's less-known
businesses, like selling transmissions to truck and bus
manufacturers, also thrived.
</P>
<P>
   GM's sales rose to $48.74 billion in the second quarter from
$45.07 billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   GM spun off its giant Delphi auto parts subsidiary during the
second quarter of last year. Including the profits from that
discontinued operation in last year's second-quarter results would
mean that GM's earnings actually shrank 8.7 percent, from $1.92
billion a year ago. But financial analysts have tended to exclude
the Delphi figures, viewing the spinoff as a splitting of GM rather
than the closing of a subsidiary.

 &HT;    Despite flush economy, Texas has saved little for a financial
rainy day
 &HT;    By Gary Susswein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - After an unexpected recession forced Texas
lawmakers to raise taxes and cut spending in the late 1980s, former
Sen. John Leedom wondered why he and his colleagues had never saved
for rough economic times.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Republican started pushing for a rainy day fund to
help Texas survive the next recession without massive tax hikes or
spending cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Now, nearly 12 years after voters approved the idea, Texas has
just $84 million in that fund _ less than two-tenths of 1 percent
of its $49 billion yearly budget _ and critics say the state still
will be swamped by that next fiscal storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame,'' Leedom said Tuesday. ``With the size of the
state's budget, I'd say if they didn't have almost a couple hundred
million dollars in their sugar bowl, they should be ashamed of
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with mandatory deposits scheduled to go into the fund this
fall, Texas still will have just $130 million in savings _ enough
to run state government for one day.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when short-term budget overruns and Gov. George W.
Bush's presidential run are focusing national attention on the
state's budget, Texas has saved less for the future than about 40
other states in the country. And officials have rejected proposals
to build up the rainy-day savings in recent years, opting instead
to expand some programs and cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The appropriate time to fill it up is exactly now because the
economy is growing fast and revenues are coming in quickly,'' said
Dick Lavine of the Austin-based Center for Public Policy
Priorities. ``You can't foresee what sort of situation it would be
used for, but it would probably be for something like we had in the
late '80s,'' when an oil industry bust depleted state revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Lavine and others pointed to the paltry rainy-day fund last week
when state officials revealed $610 million in unexpected overruns
in the current budget, a figure which could be even higher
according to an internal Bush administration memo from May.
</P>
<P>
   The state can use up to $1.1 billion in unexpected surplus
revenues to cover those overruns. But if state surpluses dry up in
the future _ and they are already shrinking _ the Legislature could
be forced to cut spending to cover new overruns, the critics say.
</P>
<P>
   State officials dismiss those arguments as gloom-and-doom
predictions. They say conservative budgeting and the yearly
surpluses _ which may be shrinking but are still around _ will
prevent major fiscal crises.
</P>
<P>
   ``During Governor Bush's tenure, the state has had large
surpluses in the state treasury where the money is earning just as
much interest as it would in the contingency fund. Because of the
state's healthy fiscal status, the Legislature and Governor Bush
saw no need to transfer surplus funds,'' said Bush spokeswoman
Linda Edwards. ``Texas has this tradition of conservative revenue
estimates (which) helps in generating sizable surpluses.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not what happened in 1986 when oil prices plummeted,
state revenues shrank and the Legislature met in an emergency
session to cut spending and raise the sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   In the next statewide election in 1988, voters approved a
constitutional amendment that created the rainy-day fund to save
for the future and help Texas' bond ratings. The fund can legally
hold up to 10 percent of the state's yearly revenues and money can
only be withdrawn with at least a three-fifths vote of the
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   That account has grown from $8 million since Bush took office,
but still falls short of the original goals.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-five percent of oil and natural gas revenues in excess
of the state's revenues from 1987 are supposed to go into it. But
those tax revenues have not usually approached the level where they
were during the boom of the 1980s and have not generated much
money.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty percent of all unused revenue at the end of a budget cycle
also was supposed to be funneled into the fund. But the Legislature
usually spends unused dollars at the end of each two-year budget
cycle, Leedom said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, an array of state leaders _ including Comptroller
Carole Keeton Rylander, House Speaker Pete Laney and Senate
Economic Development chairman David Sibley _ proposed stashing
money from the state's record surplus in the fund. But lawmakers
rejected those ideas in favor of teacher pay raises, an expansion
of children's' health insurance and $1.7 billion in tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush supported transferring $471 million of the surplus into the
savings fund when officials said the state was legally required to
do so. But those officials were able to avoid that requirement by
allocating the money elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Rylander will put $48 million from natural gas taxes into the
rainy-day fund after the current fiscal year ends on Aug. 31 and
plans to propose another allocation next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas is a big extended family and like any good family we
need to spend wisely and invest wisely and save for a rainy day,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in most of the 45 other states with rainy-day funds
agree.
</P>
<P>
   Florida automatically allocated 1 percent of the prior year's
revenues to one of its two rainy-day funds until the state's
reserves reached 5 percent of the yearly budget. Massachusetts has
amassed $1.4 billion, also more than 5 percent of its budget, by
sending much of its yearly surplus into a fund.
</P>
<P>
   A 1999 study released by the the Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities in Washington found that Massachusetts and seven other
states have saved enough to survive a recession like the one that
hit a decade ago without raising taxes or cutting spending.
</P>
<P>
   Texas was at the opposite end of that study, one of 11 states
that would have less than 80 percent of the money needed to get
through a recession without tax hikes or spending cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is hoping for another recession,'' the study's authors
concluded, ``but it's only prudent to ask whether states have done
enough to prepare for the next one.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Each night, a Russian immigrant couple sets out with
their two young ones to stroll through the dusky streets of
Manhattan Beach in southern Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The parents, Roman and Inna Flikshtein, greet their neighbors up
and down Girard Street with friendly nods and waves. Their
13-year-old daughter, Michelle, lags behind, slurping a Popsicle
and shuffling her feet. Their youngest, Cookie, lopes along beside
them in her bright red miniskirt, gleefully nibbling a peanut
offered by a neighbor _ and occasionally dragging her knuckles on
the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what if Cookie is a monkey?'' Inna Flikshtein said with
tears in her eyes. ``She is part of this family. They want to take
the baby from the mother. But she will die without us, and we will
die if we give her up.''
</P>
<P>
   To the Flikshteins and an outraged army of their neighbors,
Cookie Flikshtein is a beloved _ albeit simian _ member of the
family. She may be a monkey, they say, but she has adjusted enough
to the human condition to spend most evenings eating rocky road ice
cream and watching the nightly news.
</P>
<P>
   While the state agrees that Cookie is no ordinary monkey, it is
not because of her adopted human ways. She is a Cercopithecus
diana, commonly known as a diana monkey, an endangered species in
need of special care. And after a protracted court battle, the
state has now won permission to take Cookie from the Flikshtein
home and place her into an animal rescue program at the Detroit
Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   The saga of Cookie Flikshtein has stirred tumultuous feelings on
both sides of the fight. Backed by several experts, adamant state
officials have said the monkey does not belong in human society and
must be returned to her own. The family's neighbors, on the other
hand, have quickly closed ranks. They have threatened to barricade
the Flikshtein home on quiet Girard Street and struggle against
Cookie's forced removal to the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole neighborhood will fight, and fight hard,'' said
Lubov Gruber, who lives down the block. ``We're going to sit here
and not let people come near. We will protest this for as long as
it takes. We're crying every day. It has already broken our
hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   As their friends and neighbors rally to their defense, the
Flikshteins spend what will probably be their last days with Cookie
reaching out to prominent animal rights lawyers, writing television
producers beseeching them to tell their story, and simply flipping
through the photo album, which contains memories: Cookie's arrival
at their home five years ago. Cookie's first birthday party. Cookie
sitting in the living room with Michelle and Mom and Dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agree with the law, but sometimes there must be
exceptions,'' Flikshtein said as Cookie perched jauntily on his
arm. ``We're not prepared for her to go. We're hoping for a
miracle. I just can't see myself without ...'' he tried to say. But
his voice broke and he had to turn away.
</P>
<P>
   The Flikshteins claim they acted within the law when they bought
Cookie on Feb. 18, 1995, from The Pet Den, an exotic pet store on
Long Island. Flikshtein, the owner of a Brooklyn dental laboratory,
still has the receipt for the $4,500 purchase. He has the paperwork
from Dennis Borghese, the owner, certifying that it was a legal
sale.
</P>
<P>
   Even Borghese himself originally thought the sale was good. ``I
acquired that monkey legally,'' he said the other day. ``I was
personally unaware that it was an endangered species, but that's
what the state has said. It's a real shame all around.''
</P>
<P>
   For nearly three years, the Flikshteins lived in ignorant bliss,
welcoming Cookie into their house like one of their own. They
toilet trained her. They built her an iron cage in the living room
beneath some Picasso prints. They even made plans to erect a
``summer home'' for Cookie on a grassy patch of their spacious
backyard.
</P>
<P>
   The problems began in 1998 when the family sought the advice of
a professional monkey handler, who Flikshtein claims wanted Cookie
for himself. The monkey handler filed a report with the city that
Cookie had bitten someone on the block. Flikshtein dismisses the
complaint as a self-serving lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man told us, `Cookie is beautiful _ I'd like to have
Cookie for my own,' '' Flikshtein said. ``He made that story up,
hoping to get our Cookie for himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the authorities got wind that a rare diana monkey was
living in Manhattan Beach, they sprung into action. In August 1998,
the State Department of Environmental Conservation informed the
Flikshteins that harboring Cookie was barred by state and federal
law, and the agency won a ruling in State Supreme Court in Queens
for permission to remove the monkey from the family's home. Earlier
this month, the State Appellate Division refused to hear the
family's arguments, effectively ending their case.
</P>
<P>
   While the authorities would prefer for the Flikshteins to turn
over Cookie voluntarily, the appellate ruling has cleared the way
for the monkey to be seized at any time. ``We would prefer not to
take the animal ourselves,'' said Gail Hintz, an assistant regional
attorney with the state attorney general's office. ``It just
depends on how cooperative the family is.''
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, the state acknowledges that the Flikshteins did
not realize Cookie was a member of an endangered species, but they
have argued that allowing the monkey to remain in Brooklyn ``would
merely induce illegal traffickers to sell to unaware buyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling the Flikshtein's attachment to Cookie ``an egocentric
view of a vastly different species,'' the state argued that ``this
`humanized' monkey may well be left to its own resources should the
family suffer an unexpected change in circumstances.'' They contend
in the papers that the monkey should be ``managed in a zoological
park or sanctuary by professional biologists both for its own
protection and that of the general public.''
</P>
<P>
   Several monkey experts have supported the state's position,
saying that Cookie is a beast of the wild who deserves to live as
nature intended, no matter how much attentive care she gets at
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``This couple may think they love the animal, but they're
misguided,'' said Shirley McGreal, chairwoman of the International
Primate Protection League in Sommerville, S.C. ``If I were that
monkey I'd really want to join the other monkeys in Detroit.''
</P>
<P>
   McGreal said even the most domesticated monkeys assimilate to
outdoor life, swinging in trees and playing with other monkeys a
matter of months. ``It's a very short readjustment time,'' she
said. ``Very rapidly they learn what they are. They know that
they're not people.''
</P>
<P>
   To fight the state, the Flikshteins invited another monkey
expert, Kathi Travers, to spend a week with Cookie in their home
and draw her own conclusions. Travers, who worked for 13 years for
the ASPCA in New York before becoming a full-time animal
consultant, decided to support their cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety percent of the time I'm not in favor of keeping monkeys
as pets,'' Travers said Tuesday from her office in British
Columbia. ``But this is a very unusual situation. You can't put
Cookie into a group of monkeys now.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   These squabbles among the experts mean little to Manhattan
Beach's Russian community, many of whom have promised to stand with
the Flikshteins should the authorities try wresting Cookie from
their home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminds me of the old Russia in the '30s when Stalin was
killing innocent people,'' said Michael Yumansky, Flikshtein's
business partner, who emigrated from the former Soviet Union 11
years ago. ``We came to America to live a better life and raise our
families as we wanted. I hope we were not wrong.''

BUSH PRAISED BY TEXAS DEMOCRAT, 
SCORNED BY OTHERS 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ George W. Bush continued to draw fire from Democrats
Tuesday for budgeting shortages in his home state, but Texas'
highest-ranking Democrat praised the GOP governor for his ability
to work with the state Legislature and make the most of his office.
</P>
<P>
   Texas House Speaker Pete Laney didn't endorse Bush's
presidential bid and didn't discuss the budgetary controversy. But
he told state lawmakers from around the country that Bush has
``certainly been successful at achieving his goals'' and in
overcoming the restraints of a structurally weak office.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had asked Laney to introduce him before his speech to the
National Conference of State Legislatures. Laney's comments stood
in stark contrast to the message from other Democrats Tuesday,
including Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Before addressing crime victims at Rhodes College in Memphis,
Tenn., Gore criticized Bush's planning abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just this morning, the Houston Chronicle reported a memorandum
within the Texas state government projecting a $600 million
shortfall in the state's health care program. This apparently will
worsen an already grave budget situation, the worst in Texas in a
long, long time,'' the vice president said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the same policies that put Texas' budget surplus at
risk would threaten the federal government surplus if Bush is
elected.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democratic legislators from Texas also blasted away at
Bush over the budgeting shortfalls, which are estimated at more
than $610 million in Medicaid and a handful of other state
programs. The shortfalls threaten to eat away most of the state's
budgetary surplus.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Garnet Coleman, D-Houston, in a Gore-sponsored
conference call, said he believes the shortfall may be closer to
$750 million than the $610 million announced by legislative leaders
last week and he believes the entire surplus could be gone by the
time lawmakers meet next January.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Gonzalo Barrientos, D-Austin, accused Bush of pushing
a ``trophy tax on the backs of children and seniors, basically
mortgaging the state and people of Texas, most likely because he
was running for president.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrientos' accusation was similar to earlier Democratic
complaints that the $1.7 billion in tax cuts that Bush convinced
lawmakers to enact last year was to blame for the shortfalls. Bush
and legislative budget writers have blamed rising drug costs in the
Medicaid program and other unforeseen factors.
</P>
<P>
   Laney told the legislative conference that the Texas governor's
job is ``made more difficult by the fact that the public perception
and public expectations far exceed the constitutional authority of
the office.''
</P>
<P>
   The speaker said that a successful Texas governor had to be able
to ``persuade, to inspire, to otherwise motivate the people to take
action.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Success is determined more by personality than by power.
Governor Bush has certainly been successful at achieving his
goals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Laney, who has no Republican re-election opposition in his West
Texas district but could lose the speakership if the GOP gains a
House majority, said that he and Bush have developed a ``close
working relationship, a relationship based on mutual respect and a
desire to serve the best interests of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And our relationship has been made much more enjoyable by the
governor's sense of humor and his ability to work with the
legislative process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who is campaigning hard to woo independent voters and
Democrats to his campaign, took up where Laney left off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of those who are used to the politics of personal
destruction may think it odd that I can stand before you and tell
you that I am a good personal friend with a Democrat speaker, and I
am,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he was ``proud of the accomplishments of our state,
accomplishments as a result of both Republicans and Democrats
coming together to put the people of our state above the interests
of party.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a Chicago news conference sponsored by the Illinois
Democratic Party, Barrientos and state Sen. Mario Gallegos,
D-Houston, said that Texas, under Bush, has fallen woefully short
of meeting the people's needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush brags about being a compassionate conservative,
but he never tells anyone about the colonias or the budget
shortfall or the $33 million that he could have spent, but didn't,
on summer nutrition programs for children,'' Gallegos said.
</P>
<P>
   Gallegos criticized Bush for not visiting the colonias, poverty
stricken communities along the Texas-Mexico border, to ``see tens
of thousands of Texas children who live without water or
electricity.``

 &HT;    Tech grad Adkins halts medicine intake in bid to make Olympics
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Derrick Adkins says he has no choice. It is
an Olympic year, the one in four that athletes have to be ready. It
is the summer to take risks, if it will help you get to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Adkins, the gold medalist in Atlanta, had been struggling to
regain his prowess in the 400 hurdles. So, two weeks ago, the
Georgia Tech graduate halted daily intake of the drug that helps
control his depression. He had been on Luvox since being diagnosed
with clinical depression in 1996. ``I figured this is the Olympic
trials, so I have to take a chance,'' Adkins said. ``I know the
medication is affecting me (in races), and I might as well tough it
out and see how I do without it.''
</P>
<P>
   Adkins suffered a series of ``depressive episodes'' when he went
off the drug without telling anyone in the summer of 1996. This
time, however, it's just for the Olympic trials, he says, and it's
with the blessing of his psychiatrist, Dr. Casandra Wanzo. He also
is taking a natural supplement that claims to help control
depression.
</P>
<P>
   The first two rounds in the 400 hurdles are Thursday and Friday,
with the finals Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Derrick has to feel right with it, and he thought it was the
only thing that would give him a chance,'' said his coach, Grover
Hinsdale. ``He's taking a risk of all of a sudden not being able to
sleep, which was a problem in '96, but so far he's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   His parents and older sister are here to monitor him. So far,
the only side effect has been minor headaches. In the past,
insomnia and depression were a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``When depression sets in there are warning signs,'' he said.
``I start to get irritable, like ridiculously irritated by little
things.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a risk he is willing to take. He has found that the
anti-depressant makes him feel lackadaisical, reduces his stamina
and inhibits performance in an event in which one hundredth of a
second can be the difference in making the Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   He began the season running well but was unable to break 50
seconds in his last two European races. Those times won't land him
in the finals, where a low 48-second clocking probably will earn
one of the three spots to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``My performances in Europe made my decision to stop taking (the
drug),'' Adkins said. ``Already, I've noticed a definite change in
my speed workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee my performances will be a lot better at the
trials,'' he said. ``Whether they'll be good enough to make the
Olympic team, I'm not sure. But I know I'll be close.''

HOUSE OK'S BILL IMPLEMENTING UNIFORM ADOPTION RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A landmark treaty on international adoptions appeared headed for
enactment by the United States, with House passage Tuesday of
legislation to implement the pact and an announcement that the
Senate's lone holdout now supports ratification.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty, called the Hague Convention on Intercountry
Adoptions, is considered by adoption professionals and politicians
active on the issue to be the most ambitious effort ever attempted
to reform adoption, streamline the process, and weed out corruption
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly believe the enactment of this treaty will, to a
large degree, eliminate the abuses that currently exist,'' said US
Rep. William D. Delahunt, a Massachusetts Democrat, who was
instrumental in winning passage of the House measure. ``The lack of
ratification was going to have disastrous consequences for all
Americans who are interested in international adoptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Among its major provisions, the treaty would: establish the
first global standards intended to protect children from being sold
and improve procedures for finding them homes; prevent coercion of
birth parents by unscrupulous practitioners who want their
children; and set guidelines to cut red tape and otherwise
steamline the process for adoptive parents.
</P>
<P>
   Sources on Capitol Hill and within the US adoption community
predicted enactment of the implementing legislation and of the
treaty itself could be completed before Congress adjourns for its
August recess.
</P>
<P>
   US ratification was delayed partly because the process is
lengthy, but also because some American politicians wanted to amend
the agreement in ways that were so controversial that they stalled
its consideration.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, as a carefully crafted compromise draft of the
implementing legislation appeared close to passage, one lawmaker in
the Senate and one in the House threatened to use parliamentary
maneuvers to prevent the treaty's ratification if their concerns
weren't addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Chris Smith, a Republican from New Jersey, had
wanted the implementing legislation to preclude adoptions by
homosexuals, unmarried Americans, and others with ``promiscuous
lifestyles.'' Senator Sam Brownback, a Republican from Kansas, said
he feared the proposed rules would increase costs for adoptive
parents and impose cumbersome standards that would drive small
practitioners out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Smith finally gave his okay to the House measure after it some
changes that appear to give him some of what he wanted. The
implementing language requires each ratifying country to establish
a ``central authority'' to deal with international adoptions. The
revision obtained by Smith dictates that the US central authority
will notify American practitioners of the criteria set by other
countries for prospective adoptive parents.
</P>
<P>
   Because China and some other nations are averse to adoption of
their children by gay and single adults, many would-be parents
could be excluded. But there's a loophole: The ``sending'' country
would have to formally notify the US central authority of any
restrictions _ which may not happen because it's in the interest of
those countries to find families for thousands of orphaned and
homeless children.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly subtle concessions appear to have been made to win
over Brownback. Asked during a telephone interview whether the
senator was now ready to support passage of the Hague Convention,
his spokesman, Erik Hotmire, replied: ``He now supports the
legislation. ... The deal is done.''
</P>
<P>
   One ``improvement'' cited by Hotmire is that individual states,
in addition to the federal government, will be able to establish
entities like central authorities that could set guidelines and
accredit adoption practitioners. Many if not most states, however,
would probably leave such undertakings to the State Department _
which currently has jurisdiction over international adoptions and
would be the home of America's central authority.
</P>
<P>
   The other revision obtained by Brownback, who with his wife
adopted a daughter from China last December, was to insert language
giving extra time for small and medium agencies to meet the
treaty's standards and gain accreditation. This was not a major
sticking point for any of the pact's negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   The final product, said William Pierce, the former president of
the National Council for Adoption and the organization's consultant
on the Hague Convention, ``clearly shows a lot of subtle, nuanced
negotiations between people like Mr. Smith and Mr. Delahunt.'' He
added: ``It is a win for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The most important immediate result, according to nearly
everyone interviewed, is that nations with concerns about American
adoption practices _ most pointedly Russia and Romania, which have
recently halted the adoption of their children _ will be reassured
about the US commitment to reform.
</P>
<P>
   The Hague Convention, named for the Netherlands capital where it
was drafted, was completed in May 1993. Since then, 40 nations have
enacted it.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is by far the largest ``receiving'' nation of
international adoptees. Last year, 16,396 adoptees came to this
country from abroad, more than double the number of just a decade
earlier.

PHILIP MORRIS PROFIT RISES 5 PERCENT ON FOOD AND CIGARETTE GAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reporting solid growth in its food and cigarette businesses,
Philip Morris said Tuesday that its second-quarter profit rose 5.5
percent, matching Wall Street expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Net income rose to $2.17 billion, or 95 cents a share, compared
with profit from operations of $2.06 billion, or 85 cents a share,
in the quarter a year earlier. Sales rose 5.2 percent, to $20.84
billion from $19.81 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The results were in line with analysts' forecasts, according to
First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks company earnings.
</P>
<P>
   In the quarter a year earlier, the company took a $45 million
pretax charge to cover the costs of laying off employees in its
domestic tobacco business. That made net income $2.03 billion, or
84 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of cigarettes continued to fall by 1 percent to 2 percent
for the industry over all, but Philip Morris' sales in the United
States increased 3.6 percent, and its market share rose to 51
percent of cigarettes sold at retail outlets from 50.2 percent in
the quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The domestic tobacco division's profits increased by 6.5
percent, the company said, because of higher prices a pack. Revenue
from domestic sales of brands like Marlboro and Merit increased
20.5 percent, to $5.7 billion from $4.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings announcement made no mention of the $145 billion
punitive-damages judgment against Philip Morris and other tobacco
makers by a Florida jury last week. Analysts expect the judgment to
be appealed for years to come and said there would be no material
effect on the companies for a long time, if ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a serious issue, but I think it's very manageable,''
said David Adelman, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
Another price increase on cigarettes is expected by Labor Day, with
analysts predicting 12 to 15 cents a pack.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris said sales increased in its international tobacco
and Kraft food divisions, as well. A disappointment was Miller
Brewing Co., where sales dropped by 2.9 percent but profits rose by
8.4 percent because of price increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shipments were weaker than expected, but Miller is such a
small part of their portfolio,'' said Bill Pecoriello, a tobacco
and beverage analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein. ``The profits were
in line, even though shipments were weak.''
</P>
<P>
   On the international tobacco front, Philip Morris said that its
revenue fell 1.8 percent compared with that in the period a year
earlier but that profits increased by 4.6 percent. About 62 percent
of the profits came from sales in Western Europe and Japan, where
volume rose as well. Volume slid in markets like Central and
Eastern Europe, the company said, and duty-free shipments were
lower because of the end of duty-free sales within the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Kraft Foods division, which will get much larger
when the acquisition of Nabisco Holdings is completed at the end of
this year, turned in an impressive performance. Sales grew 3.8
percent and profits rose 5.3 percent, generally better than the
industry average. The company credited products like Capri Sun and
Tang beverages, as well as Balance Bar, an energy snack bought
earlier this year. Lunchables and Kraft cheese also showed higher
sales, while Kraft Macaroni and Cheese and Post cereals declined.
</P>
<P>
   The international food business showed lower sales, but profits
rose 5.1 percent, the company said. ``That was the business that
did the best relative to expectations,'' Adelman said. ``If you
adjust for currency impact, the profits were up 12 percent. They
are starting to see the benefits from integrating their sales force
in Europe and showing stronger execution as well as new products.''
</P>
<P>
   The combining of the Nabisco business with Kraft should go
smoothly, Adelman said, although layoffs are expected.
</P>
<P>
   The Nabisco brands include Oreo cookies, Ritz crackers and Life
Savers candy. Philip Morris agreed last month to buy the company
for $14.9 billion, or about $55 a share. It plans to spin off about
20 percent of the combined food company in a public offering next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris also said it bought back 36 million shares of its
stock at a cost of $900 million. The stock has been lagging,
largely because of tobacco litigation. Shares of Philip Morris rose
43.75 cents, to $24.0625.

<P>
   ANIANE, France _ The United States is famous for its corporate
marketing. Think Coke and McDonald's. France is famous for its fine
wines. Think Chateau Lafite and Chateau Latour.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, then, an American juggernaut like Robert Mondavi Corp.
wandering into a French village like Aniane, which prides itself on
its centuries-old vineyards. Mondavi, the big wine company from
Napa Valley, Calif., announces its plans to rip down a swath of
publicly owned forest to create its own top-of-the-line vines,
thereby adding panache to its well-known brand name.
</P>
<P>
   In an area where distrust of pervasive American culture has been
on the boil of late, the intrusion was bound to light a fire among
some locals. In fact, it has brought on the most adventuresome
management hurdle yet in the career of David Pearson, Mondavi's top
executive in France.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson, 38, an oenologist from San Diego who is fluent in
French, spent a year in the mid-1980s working with traditional
winemakers in France. So, he could be forgiven for thinking his
task would be straightforward when he was dispatched from Mondavi's
California headquarters in early 1998 with the task of finding a
good location, acquiring it and starting a new vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   The search for the right spot took two years. That, as it turned
out, was the easy part.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Pearson announced to local reporters that Mondavi wanted
to lease a forested hillside above this village 15 miles northeast
of the Mediterranean city of Montpellier and create France's first
foreign-owned vin de terroire, the designation for a wine unique to
a French region.
</P>
<P>
   He expected Aniane's 2,120 inhabitants to cheer. After all,
Mondavi would be pumping $8 million into the local economy the next
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, some squawked _ loudly. They protested the destruction
of acres of their forest, where they have hunted wild boar for
hundreds of years. More than that, they feared that the arrival of
a multinational operation would lead to a lowering of standards.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson, the chief executive of Vichon SARL, Mondavi's French
unit, repeatedly assured the villagers that the company would
cherish the region's old growing methods. He noted that Mondavi
would be selling the wine it produced there in the United States,
not France. He inundated the town with documents and statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, after three months of negotiations with local
officials, he has yet to sign a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said to myself, this could turn out to be a kind of Elian
Gonzalez _ the bigger political issues around the project could
complicate a pretty simple matter,'' Pearson said. ``There are raw
nerves out there that our opponents have used.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One of the most outspoken of those foes is Aime Guibert, 75, the
owner of the Daumas Gassac vineyard that produces one of the finest
wines in Languedoc, the region in which Aniane sits. Guibert is not
one to hide his emotions. When the hugely popular farm leader Jose
Bove went on trial in June for attacking a half-built McDonald's
restaurant north of here, Guibert showed up to speak at a mass
rally in support of Bove. Unfortunately for Pearson, Guibert's
property abuts the forests Mondavi wants to buy, and he is in no
mood to welcome it as a new neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mondavi will never have a minute's rest and peace if he
destroys the forest,'' Guibert said, sweeping his arm in the
direction of the hills outside his old stone farmhouse. ``Robert
Mondavi comes from an industrial wine civilization, not a
traditional civilization. I wrote to him and said, `Robert, don't
be mad, don't do something against the village!'''
</P>
<P>
   Allied with Guibert is Marcel Pouget, a metal-factory owner, who
runs Aniane's hunting association and has spent his free time
tacking posters to the village street poles, reading: ``Non a
Mondavi.''
</P>
<P>
   Pouget, who hunts boar in the hills that Mondavi covets, formed
a committee in May to block the company's venture and vowed to take
the case to court if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mondavi wins, it will be the death of wines in Aniane,''
Pouget fumed over a morning glass of pastis in his garden in
Aniane. ``We have little chateaux here. Within a few years, Mondavi
will be buying up land in other parts.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondavi's critics also fear that the company will use the Aniane
vineyard to start a far bigger onslaught on the region's wine
industry. ``They are coming in saying they're making a high-class
wine,'' said Mark Lintott, a British book editor who lives in
Octon, near Aniane. He questions the $8 million Mondavi is prepared
to spend. ``The figure sounds like a big industrial winery,''
Lintott said. ``The figure is hiding something. It's out of all
proportion.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lintott is active in a local environmental group that has spoken
out against Mondavi and that is also fighting a bid by another U.S.
company, Panoz Auto Development Co. in Hoschton, Ga., to take over
a section of protected public land around a lake north of Aniane to
build a resort hotel complete with golf course and auto race track.
</P>
<P>
   France has long resisted economic and cultural incursions by
foreigners, particularly Americans. But in the global economy, the
quest for national purity is becoming an uphill battle. After all,
French interests own several vineyards in Northern California.
Tattinger has its own little piece of heaven smack in the middle of
Napa Valley.
</P>
<P>
   For many people here, though, Mondavi's plans seem to threaten a
precious tradition: the age-old cultivation of small-scale wines,
``one of the crown jewels of France,'' as Pearson calls them.
</P>
<P>
   Mondavi is not about to halt its plans to please the
traditionalists of Aniane, however. Having gone public in 1993, it
has grown into an international player with more than $370 million
in revenue last year. It has vineyards in Italy and Chile and sells
its wines in more than 80 countries. In June, with a black-tie
dinner in California for hundreds of clients and a charity auction
in Manhattan, it celebrated the 20th anniversary of Opus One, its
joint California operation with Baron Philippe de Rothschild, who
died in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Mondavi is arguably the most skillful global marketer
in the business. And what would an adroit global wine company be
without a vineyard in France?
</P>
<P>
   Pearson says the company was driven to start a vineyard in
Languedoc in part because the area's winemakers are moving away
from mass-produced, low-quality wine to classy labels created on
small farms. Unlike the fine old wine areas of Burgundy and
Bordeaux, the area seems almost up for grabs. ``The whole issue of
developing a region in France is a huge attraction of itself for
the Mondavi family,'' Pearson said. ``It's not based on short-term
returns. It's a passion for winemaking. It tends to be
contagious.''
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived in France two years ago, Pearson began
discreetly driving around Languedoc, scouting for land. His dream
was to start a classic domaine, a farm that would produce a small
quantity of top-end wine.
</P>
<P>
   Since Languedoc winemakers were producing their best wine in
many decades, however, no high-quality vineyards were for sale.
Then, in May 1999, Pearson turned off the national highway and
drove into the hills outside Aniane. ``I knew immediately this was
the spot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He still believes the project will pan out. The town council is
planning to vote on the project on July 25. Meanwhile, Pearson
brushes aside the main objection of opponents, that the project
will destroy 500 acres of woods, saying the Aniane authorities will
ultimately permit the creation of only about 125 acres of
vineyards. Pearson expects to produce about 240,000 bottles of wine
by 2010 to sell in American stores for about $60 a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   He drives his visitor up into the middle of the forest and
climbs atop a water tank to soak in the panoramic view. From this
perch, he sketches in the air the 10 ``islands'' of vines, each of
which will cover about 12 acres. The rest of the land, he insists,
will be left undisturbed. ``This place is wild country, that's its
magic,'' he declares. ``Why would we want to change it?''
</P>
<P>
   Pearson even hired local ecologists to do an environmental
impact study, which concluded that the company's vines might
improve the forest's biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Pearson says, his detractors are a bothersome
minority. Indeed, he has powerful backers, including Andre Ruiz,
the mayor of Aniane, who believes Mondavi's presence will bring the
village winemakers the kind of international recognition they could
sorely use.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know very well it will be easier to sell Aniane wines in
the global markets,'' Ruiz said. Since the forest is public land,
he points out, Mondavi will not actually own it but will take a
99-year lease on it.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Pearson can cut a deal with the town fathers, though,
his ordeal will not be over. Next, Mondavi will have to gain
``planting rights,'' a process akin to getting one's hands on a New
York City taxi medallion. Under European laws that restrict wine
production, planting new vines requires buying an equal number of
someone else's vines _ perhaps disused ones _ and ripping them out
of the ground, freeing up those planting rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, I didn't understand the complexities of what
was going on,'' Pearson said of all the hurdles he had faced. ``Now
I understand that this is all very, very complicated.''

CHILD'S DEATH DOESN'T CHANGE 
PRO-GUN ATTITUDE OF TEXAS TOWN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARVEY RICE 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIS, Texas _ The accidental death of a 3-year-old boy who
found a pistol under a mattress has done little to sway strongly
pro-gun sentiment in this Southeast Texas town of 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an old country boy and I'm a firm believer that
individuals should have the right to protect themselves,'' said
Richard Evans, 56, a machine shop owner.
</P>
<P>
   Evans' opinion was typical of Willis residents in an informal
survey following the death last week of Cory Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The boy had been playing in his mother's bedroom and found the 9
mm pistol hidden under the mattress. He was buried Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Firearms killed 84 children age 4 and younger nationwide in
1997, according to the most recently published figures from the
National Center for Health Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, unofficial figures for 1999 from the state Bureau of
Epidemiology show that firearms killed two children age 5 or
younger.
</P>
<P>
   If people age 19 and younger are included, the national figure
is 4,223 and the Texas figure is 21.
</P>
<P>
   Although saddened by Cory Smith's death, many residents of
Willis, about 50 miles north of Houston, said parents bear the
responsibility for keeping children away from guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many kids get killed with guns because of their parents or
grandparents,'' who fail to take safety precautions, Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he is a ``firm believer'' in the use of trigger
locks, and favors a law requiring them.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Stanley, 51, and his wife, Ellen, 41, disagreed, saying
they strongly oppose any sort of gun-control law, including trigger
locks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think they are trying to disarm us,'' said Stanley,
who runs an electronics shop with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hearts go out to that family,'' his wife said. ``I can't
even imagine losing a kid.'' Nevertheless, she said only parents
can prevent such accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is overwhelming antipathy in the community for
gun control, several Willis residents defied the trend. Jose Luis
Garcia, 44, a cook, said, ``I don't think guns should be kept in
the house.''
</P>
<P>
   He said gun-control measures could put an end to the market in
illegal guns.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates from both sides of the gun-control issue interpreted
Cory's death differently.
</P>
<P>
   The number of children killed each year by guns is low, said Don
Kates, criminologist and research fellow at the Pacific Research
Institute for Public Policy, a conservative think tank in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extremely rare phenomenon,'' Kates said.
``Basically, the number of children killed each year in gun
accidents is about the same number each year killed from eating
iron tablets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is wildly exaggerated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Brian Morton, spokesman for the Center to Prevent Handgun
Violence based in Washington, D.C., said, ``This isn't a question
of how many kids die from eating iron tablets. The question is,
`Are these deaths preventable?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, it happens a lot more than you would think,''
Morton said. ``People are leaving their guns loaded and unlocked
and kids are getting a hold of them.''

INDONESIAN OFFICIAL INVESTIGATING CORRUPTION BECOMES TARGET OF
VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ When Attorney General Marzuki Darusman
began investigating former President Suharto and his family on
charges of corruption last year, he expected strong resistance from
the elite, which benefited greatly under the strongman's rule.
</P>
<P>
   Marzuki, a reformist known for his human rights work, also
expected sharp criticism from leftist groups and student protesters
for not being more aggressive in prosecuting Suharto, who governed
Indonesia for 32 years, until he was forced to step down two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Marzuki said he never expected that his inquiry into whether
Suharto's vast fortune was amassed at public expense would make him
a target of violence, as it did on July 5, when a bomb exploded in
his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never thought that anyone would go this far, to such an
extreme,'' Marzuki said in an interview in his heavily guarded
office. ``But this shows that we are making progress toward our
goal.''
</P>
<P>
   That goal extends far beyond punishing Suharto and his cronies
for reported abuses. The attorney general said his objective was to
restore the rule of law and a sense of equality to Indonesia, where
corruption permeated nearly every aspect of society under Suharto's
government. That is a colossal task that could cost Marzuki, who
has expressed presidential ambitions, his political career, if not
his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attorney general is one of the few politicians who is
earnestly committed to implementing democracy and establishing the
supremacy of law at great personal risk to himself,'' said Umar
Juoro, director of the Center for Information and Development
Studies, a research group. ``The broader question is how long will
this attorney general last in office, and the answer depends on the
president and Darusman's political and social connections.''
</P>
<P>
   Marzuki, 55, has emerged as perhaps the most prominent minister
of the fledging government of President Abdurrahman Wahid, who took
power in October in Indonesia's first contested presidential
election. Wahid's government has undertaken an ambitious agenda to
rebuild Indonesia, which has the world's fourth-largest population,
into a modern democracy.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But Indonesia has been plagued with political infighting and
rising sectarian violence that has killed thousands of people and
displaced hundreds of thousands more. The government has attributed
much of the unrest to political and military forces that are loyal
to Suharto and seek to destabilize the country.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The police say they believe that Suharto's sympathizers were
behind the bombing of the attorney general's office, which occurred
shortly after one of Suharto's sons had been questioned in
connection with the corruption charges. The blast destroyed part of
a building where the attorney general is compiling records for the
case. The day after the attack, the police defused a second bomb in
the building. Forensic evidence suggests that the explosives were
from the army, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the attack, Marzuki pledged to press the case, which he
plans to hand over to a court for trial sometime before Aug. 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a strong element of apprehension in this office after
the bombing incident,'' he said. ``But we've come so far that we
can't really turn around now. Our investigators feel that the case
is solid and that there's not much the opposition can do to deter
us.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Indeed, it would be hard for Marzuki to back down. When he took
office last year, the attorney general pledged that as a first step
toward restoring confidence in the government he planned aggressive
prosecutions of cases that involved high officials. In addition to
Suharto's case, Marzuki is investigating a political financing
scandal in the banking system and human rights abuses by the
military in Aceh and East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``These three cases are crucial, because they will go a long way
in convincing the public that this government has the legitimacy to
clean up this very messy situation,'' Marzuki said. ``At no point
in this country's history has there been greater pressure from the
public to rectify things and correct past ills.''
</P>
<P>
   Marzuki was appointed attorney general last year after having
led the National Commission on Human Rights, where he investigated
complaints against the military over kidnappings, mass killings and
rapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw case after case in which army personnel were committing
grave crimes and being allowed to go scot-free,'' Marzuki said.
``When you see these things firsthand, you don't forget them, and
something inside drives you to want to change the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Marzuki made his mark in political circles as a respected
reformer in the Golkar Party, Suharto's longtime machine. He was
instrumental in rallying party support for Wahid's election.
</P>
<P>
   The eldest son of a former diplomat, Marzuki spent his formative
years living in Mexico, Russia, and Switzerland. He said that as a
youth growing up overseas he first recognized the inequities of
Indonesian society compared with the West.
</P>
<P>
   His critics maintain that although the attorney general has
pursued high-profile cases with fanfare, he has been slow to clean
his own house. Marzuki promised to replace dozens of assistant
attorney generals and senior prosecutors who were known to be
corrupt, but many of them have kept their posts.
</P>
<P>
   J.E. Sahetapy, chairman of the National Law Commission, which
Wahid set up to chart a course for legal reform, said he would
score Marzuki's performance in office a 6.5 out of 10 points.
Sahetapy said he was deeply concerned that the attorney general had
failed to go after Suharto's accomplices in the corruption inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's only pursued the case to a certain point, because many of
his colleagues from his own party are involved,'' Sahetapy said.
``Most of the people who are now in power are involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Marzuki acknowledged that much work was left to be done. ``The
successful prosecution of these cases will only restore minimal
confidence in the system,'' he said. ``Then comes the hard point of
real reform, which will take years if not decades.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Svetlana Lunkina and Maria Alexandrova have a
fawnlike delicacy that suggests they might break if touched. But as
the two young Bolshoi Ballet stars talked, in a backstage
conversation on Monday that was filled with laughter and wry
opinions about art and life, it quickly became apparent that
underneath that fragility lay strong wills and stronger senses of
self.
</P>
<P>
   Lunkina, 20, will dance the title role in ``Giselle'' on
Saturday and Sunday afternoons at the New York State Theater in
Manhattan in a new production by the Bolshoi Theater director
Vladimir Vasiliev, in an engagement presented by Lincoln Center
Festival 2000. She is the youngest Bolshoi ballerina ever to tackle
the demanding role.
</P>
<P>
   Alexandrova, 21, will dance Myrtha, the queen of the ghostly,
man-hating Wilis, on Sunday afternoon to Lunkina's Giselle. And
each will perform lead roles in George Balanchine's sumptuous
pure-dance ``Symphony in C'' on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
nights.
</P>
<P>
   The two are the darlings of ballet critics in Russia and
Britain. In a Bolshoi engagement this spring at the Kennedy Center
in Washington, Alexandrova was praised for the regal grandeur of
her dancing and for her astonishing jumps. ``I'm not satisfied with
it yet,'' she said of her jump, speaking in Russian translated by
Marina Panfilovich.
</P>
<P>
   Lunkina is new to New York, but she has been much talked about
not just for her impressive technique but also for the qualities
Vasiliev sought in his new Giselle. ``After a long gap a young girl
has now joined our company who, it seems to me, answers to the role
of Giselle,'' he told a Russian interviewer before the production's
premiere in 1997, the year Lunkina graduated from the Moscow
Academy of Dance, affiliated with the Bolshoi. ``She is beautiful,
light, graceful, sincere, feminine and what is more her technique
improves before our very eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Lunkina and Alexandrova began to dance at very young ages
in the kind of local amateur children's folk-dance clubs in which
Rudolf Nureyev got his start before going on to the academy. At age
9 Alexandrova, whose father is a state official, saw a television
documentary about the school of the Kirov Ballet, Russia's other
great international troupe, and knew that she must join the Bolshoi
school in Moscow, where she lived. ``My mother was a little
afraid,'' she recalled. ``She knew how hard and how complicated the
life of a ballerina is. But I said I would do it, and I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Alexandrova, Lunkina comes from a family that is not
involved in the arts except for her sister, Julia, who has just
graduated from the Bolshoi school. Her father prints scholarly
texts, and her mother is a former circus gymnast who understood her
older daughter's psychological makeup very well, Lunkina said,
laughing. ``I did not dream of being a ballerina,'' she said. Early
in life, she had answered a casual yes to her mother's even more
casual question, ``Would you like to dance?''
</P>
<P>
   At 12, she told her mother she wanted to leave the school. The
life of a ballerina was too hard. ``So leave,'' her mother told
her, wisely allowing her willful daughter to decide. ``Do as you
like.'' Lunkina laughed. ``My mother knew if she told me to stay, I
would never do it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about their dance heroes during training, both dancers
immediately mentioned their earliest teachers at the Bolshoi.
Alexandrova's began her training with Liudmila Kolenchenko.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all so afraid of her,'' Alexandrova said. ``And we all
adored her. She was very strict, but she loved us all.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexandrova knew that her parents adored her, too, she said.
``But here was a person who I understood, who did her best to
explain to me what I needed in order to do something in my life.
She taught us to have professional discipline. And we were small
children then, so everything was emotional for us. The graduates
seemed like gods. I think nowadays the attitude of small children
is different. But ballet was sacred for us.'' Alexandrova, who
finished her training with Sofia Golovkina, went on to win a gold
medal in the 1997 Moscow International Ballet Competition and to
create lead roles in Boris Eifman's ``Russian Hamlet'' and a
revival of Petipa's ``Pharaoh's Daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Lunkina's beloved first teacher was Natalia Savina. ``She must
have had a hard job,'' she said. ``I had a very nasty character.
But she soothed me. She told me I must and I did.'' Part of the
problem was that Lunkina loved swimming, painting and singing as
much as ballet and lost her voice for two years because of overuse.
</P>
<P>
   Another crucial person in her life was Marina Leonova, her
teacher and coach in her last years of training. Leonova brought
Lunkina to the attention of Bolshoi Ballet personnel, among them
Vasiliev and his wife, Ekaterina Maximova, the former leading
Bolshoi ballerina, who coached the awestruck teen-ager in the role
of the betrayed Giselle.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me those rehearsals with her were the most dear and most
sacred,'' Lunkina said. ``I tried to listen to every word and note
of her. ``I was so afraid I wouldn't cope. It was such a
responsibility, because I didn't think myself such a genius to
dance Giselle at 18. In any case my first Giselle was a Giselle of
my emotions exclusively. I gave every corner of myself at that
performance and only because of this was it a success. I was living
Giselle's life onstage.''
</P>
<P>
   The two ballerinas said they hoped New York audiences would see
the human beings inside their Giselle and Myrtha. And ``Symphony in
C,'' which demands such a different kind of dancing? ``They
shouldn't see how hard it is,'' Alexandrova said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh! `Symphony!''' Lunkina said with a sigh. ``I would like the
whole company, and especially myself, to show the beauty, strength
and emotions of this ballet.''

NEGOTIATORS SEEK CONCLUSION BEFORE DEADLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ Working in a state of heightened tension as an
early morning deadline loomed, Middle East negotiators Tuesday
night raced toward conclusion, struggling to reach some form of
agreement in the hours before President Clinton's scheduled
departure for Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very crucial moment,'' Israeli immigration minister
Yuli Tamir said in a telephone interview. ``We're going back and
forth, and the negotiations are in full swing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The pace has picked up,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart
said. ``There are intense discussions, and negotiations going on
right now between the two parties. I think they understand what we
are up against here.''
</P>
<P>
   One of three outcomes seemed likely: That negotiators would
reach a full-blown agreement, that they would settle for
incremental progress, or that they would go home with none of the
core issues resolved. But details were scarce, and it appeared any
deal would have to come well after midnight, as delegates from all
sides worked virtually around the clock within confines of the
presidential compound.
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday evening, only one thing was clear: That talks to
end the 52-year conflict were increasingly strenuous, with Clinton
and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak meeting until 4:30 a.m. on
Monday before taking a five-hour break and starting again Tuesday.
Despite rumors about the nature of the discussions _ in particular
that Israel was considering a deal that would recognize a
Palestinian state _ White House officials refused to give details
of what was being said.
</P>
<P>
   They did, however, sound firmly committed to wrapping up before
Clinton leaves for another summit in Japan. After eight days of
news briefings, Lockhart declared that Tuesday night's would be his
last. And he said that when Clinton leaves Wednesday at around 8
a.m., ``he will have done his business here.''
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with Barak on Sunday night, Clinton met with
Palestinian leader Yassir Arafat Tuesday for about an hour,
officials said. Arafat and Barak have met face-to-face only four
times since the summit started nine days ago, and have not done so
since last week.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are four key issues: the fate of Palestinian refugees;
territory and borders; Israeli security; and control over
Jerusalem. The debates are considered so difficult that leaders
have postponed negotiating them throughout the last seven years of
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton could still postpone his trip for up to a day. He would
miss scheduled talks with the Japanese leader, but still be on time
for the summit of leading industrialized nations that begins in
Okinawa on Friday. US officials, by restating their determination
to leave, seemed to be once again sending a message to negotiators
to make final concessions in time for Clinton's departure.
</P>
<P>
   As the talks intensified, teenage Israeli settlers gathered in
protest about five miles from Camp David at the Thurmont Senior
Center, across the street from the site where US officials have
been briefing reporters for the last week. A senior member of the
Israeli opposition, Likud party member Uzi Landau, also arrived at
the site, warning journalists that the reports being leaked out of
the talks were a ``reason for grave concern.'' In the background, a
group of American Jewish campgoers chanted and played the drums in
the name of peace.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of miles away, the speaker of the Israeli Parliament,
Avraham Burg, suggested Barak might agree to the recognition of a
Palestinian state. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has long said
he would declare an independent state on Sept. 13 if no other
compromise can be reached; Burg, who has been in frequent contact
with Barak throughout the talks, said formally recognizing a
Palestinian state could move the peace process forward, especially
since Israel may be faced with a self-self-declared state in less
than two months, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, let's not fool ourselves, OK?'' Burg said. ``If it
walks like a duck, if it talks like a duck, if it sounds like a
duck, it's a Palestinian state.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials strongly cautioned against taking such
outside musings as fact. Spokesman Lockhart, who has ridiculed
press accounts of the talks all week, said ``the batting average of
reports coming out of people who are not here has not improved.''
</P>
<P>
   Other rumors continued to surface, including one that the talks
had broken down completely, with Arafat threatening to abandon
negotiation. But veterans of past peace talks said that a tantrum
often precedes a breakthrough, and Lockhart said he had not heard
either side was planning to walk out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy it'd be a long walk. You gotta go all the way down the
mountain,'' Lockhart joked.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, in between two long meetings with Barak,
Clinton telephoned US House Speaker Dennis Hastert to give him an
update on the talks. Hastert denied Clinton talked specifically
about how much finacial assistance the United States would be
willing to contribute to a peace deal. But in interviews, Hastert,
an Illinois Republican, refused to offer a blank check.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reiterated again that if it is a large dollar number, if
there is an agreement, talk to us,'' Hastert said. ``We have to
appropriate that money. It is the job of Congress to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart responded to the remarks with caution. ``I think
everyone should just hold their fire on what they think it should
be, what they think it shouldn't be, until we've got something in
place and we can actually look at what the real needs are,'' he
said.

MICROSOFT SAYS PROFITS ROSE 20 PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Microsoft Corp. may have been battered in courts
and in the stock market this past year. But the software giant
remains a formidable money-making machine, Tuesday reporting a 20
percent increase in its annual profits.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, in an announcement after the market close, posted
profits of $9.42 billion on revenue of $22.96 billion for its
fiscal year ended June 30. Last year, the company earned $7.79
billion on $19.75 billion in revenue. For its fourth quarter, the
Redmond, Wash., company recorded profits of $2.41 billion, or 44
cents a share, on revenue of $5.8 billion, soundly beating
expectations of 42 cents a share by 27 Wall Street analysts
surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
</P>
<P>
   For Microsoft, the earnings report comes as a welcome break from
the drumbeat of setbacks the company has experienced in its
unsuccessful attempts to fend off a U.S. Department of Justice
antitrust lawsuit and the resulting slide in the company's once
high-flying stock.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's shares rallied 31.25 cents to close at $78.50 on the
Nasdaq. That's up from a 17-month low of $61.4375 on May 26, but
still far below the company's 52-week high attained on Dec. 30 of
$117.625. In after-hours trading, the Redmond, Wash. company's
shares gained another 37.5 cents to $78.875.
</P>
<P>
   That Microsoft's shares have fared so poorly in recent months
contrasts with what many analysts consider to be a company with a
solid balance sheet and robust profits. That has left money
managers in a quandary over whether to buy, sell, or hang on to
their shares in the company.
</P>
<P>
   For now, most stock pickers have been reluctant to relinquish
their considerable holdings in Microsoft, in part due to the
company's habit of turning in financial results that beat Wall
Street's expectations every quarter since 1994. As a result, one in
every three U.S. stock mutual funds continues to hold Microsoft
shares, despite the stock's rocky performance this year, according
to figures from Morningstar, a mutual fund research company in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft projected its growth will slow in the coming fiscal
year as a result of its increased investment in research on
technology not based on the company's traditional stronghold in
personal computers, where it has a 90 percent share in the market
for operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts, Microsoft's chief financial
officer, John Connors, said it will step up spending on research
and development by 15 percent this year to about $4.4 billion on
such areas as mobile devices, home entertainment products, and
Internet-related products.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft's most anticipated initiative, the so-called
Microsoft.net project announced earlier this year, will have no
effect on revenues this year and is not expected to contribute to
the company's bottom line until the year 2002, Connors said.
</P>
<P>
   In the company's characteristically conservative manner, Connors
downplayed his company's ability to continue its winning streak. He
projected that growth in revenues would slow to 15 percent for the
fiscal year 2001, slightly lower than the 16 percent the company
reported for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Connors said 3 million licenses have been sold for Microsoft's
current flagship operating system, Windows 2000, since the product
was introduced in Feb. 17. But he ascribed a ``sluggishness'' in
sales of Windows 2000 to the fact that the product is aimed at
companies, which tend to switch operating systems far more slowly
than consumers. The consumer version of Microsoft's newest
operating system for consumers, Windows ME, is not expected to ship
until September.
</P>
<P>
   Connors made no mention of an ongoing inquiry by the U.S.
Securities Exchange Commission into Microsoft's accounting
practices. Last year, Microsoft disclosed that the SEC had launched
a probe into allegations by a former Microsoft employee that the
company manipulates its substantial cash reserves to ``smooth
over'' quarterly fluctuations in profits and assure a stable
progression in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft spokewoman said the SEC investigation was ``still
pending.''

occasionally even English. No less than Parliament House with Big

 &HT;    Survey: Some GOP delegates support pro-choice VP
 &HT;    By Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ As Gov. George W. Bush moves toward a decision on a
running mate, a survey of GOP delegates shows that nearly half
would support him if he chose someone who supports abortion rights,
according to an Associate Press poll released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 1,767 out of 2,066 GOP delegates found that 49
percent said they would support Bush if he chose a running mate
such as Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge. Twenty-two percent said they
would not back an abortion-rights supporter and 15 percent said
they didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   Those surveyed listed Ridge as their first choice followed
closely by Elizabeth Dole with Rep. John Kasich, of Ohio, retired
Gen. Colin Powell and Arizona Sen. John McCain. About half the
delegates did not respond to the questionnaire.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge, a Catholic from a key swing state, supports Roe v. Wade.
He opposes government financing for abortions and the late-term
procedure dubbed ``partial birth'' by opponents. Like Bush, he
supports parental notification for minors seeking abortions. New
Jersey Gov. Christie Todd Whitman, who has also been mentioned as a
possible running mate, infuriated members of her party when she
vetoed a measure to outlaw so-called partial birth abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Scott McClellan would not say if the survey could
bolster their chances, adding that Bush ``has been considering a
diverse group.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As he has said, he'll make a decision based on three
criteria,'' McClellan said. ``Are they ready to be president? Do
they share his conservative views? And will they be loyal.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush wound up a two-day campaign trip in Chicago Tuesday by
announcing $200 million plan to promote responsible fatherhood.
Later, in a speech before the National Conference of State
Legislatures, Bush called states ``the laboratories of change,''
and traded quips with Democratic Texas House Speaker Pete Laney,
who joined him on stage at the Navy Pier Convention Center with
Republican Lt. Gov. Rick Perry.
</P>
<P>
   Bush returned to Austin Tuesday after an evening fundraiser in
Chicago expected to raise $2.25 million. He remains in Austin today
as the political world waits to hear who he will choose as his
running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by Perry and Laney at the National Conference of State
Legislatures, Bush continued portraying himself as a governor able
to reach across party lines.
</P>
<P>
   The speech, a promise to ``restore civility on the national
level,'' echoed the first address Bush made in Washington after
securing the Republican nomination during the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Bush told the audience that Washington can learn
from the Texas Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second biggest state in the union and we only meet four
months out of every two years,'' he said. ``I guess our motto is if
government doesn't meet it can't hurt you. And yet it may not be a
bad lesson for Washington, D.C. come to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In his introduction, Laney offered the audience a brief lesson
in Texas legislative history, making it clear that the governor
wields little real power, and ultimately chalking Bush's successes
up to his talent for playing well with others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being the chief executive of any state is a difficult job, but
in Texas it's made more difficult by the fact that public
perception and public expectations far exceed the constitutional
authority of the office of governor,'' Laney said. ``...Success is
determined more by personality than the exercise of power and Gov.
Bush has certainly been successful at achieving his goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush shot back with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to be on the stage with two distinguished Texans.
Well, two Texans,'' he said, going on to call Laney, ``a good man
and a good friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Laney _ a Democrat in a state where many in his party are
backing Bush _ has not said whether he will offer an endorsement.
And he wasn't eager to probe that question after his appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's appearance with Laney came on a day that another national
poll, by USA Today newspaper, shows support for Vice President Gore
creeping up while support for Bush slowly eroding.
</P>
<P>
   Of 1,063 adults surveyed, 48 percent said they would support
Bush and 46 percent said they would support Gore in a two-way race.
The poll, with a 3 percentage point margin of error, comes one week
after another USA Today Poll had Bush leading Gore 50 percent to 41
percent.

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Tuesday passed a tax cut for married
couples, taking a big step in the election-year push by Republicans
to highlight their differences with Democrats over what to do with
the federal budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 61-38, with eight Democrats joining Republicans to
approve the measure, which would reduce taxes for nearly all
married couples by $248 billion over the next 10 years. One
Republican voted against.
</P>
<P>
   A similar though somewhat smaller measure passed the House
earlier this year. Republican leaders said they would act quickly
to meld the two versions and send the legislation to President
Clinton, who said he would veto it as too costly and too tilted to
the wealthiest taxpayers at a time when the needs of lower- and
middle-income people are going unmet.
</P>
<P>
   But in an acknowledgment that tax reductions appear to be
gaining political appeal at a time of growing budget surpluses,
Clinton reiterated his willingness to negotiate a compromise under
which he would accept a tax cut for couples of the scale sought by
Republicans if Congress would accept his plan to add prescription
drug coverage to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans showed no inclination to take him up on the offer,
and said that a veto would help them make their case that Democrats
are standing in the way of popular tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed by the Senate was packaged by Republicans as a
reduction in the marriage penalty, the quirk in the tax code that
leaves many two-income couples paying a higher tax bill than they
would if they had remained single.
</P>
<P>
   But it would cut taxes for almost all married couples, whether
or not they pay a marriage penalty. The bill would not cut taxes
for single people.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said the bill was good economic and social policy
because it would help to eliminate what they see as an unfair levy
on marriage while advancing their agenda of returning as much of
the surplus as possible to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   They said their case was only helped on Tuesday by the release
of new surplus projections by the Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
   The budget office said it now expects the surplus outside of
Social Security to total nearly $2.2 trillion over the next 10
years, assuming that government spending grows in line with
inflation. The surplus projection is about $300 billion higher than
a similar estimate made last month by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill is the centerpiece of our efforts to reduce the tax
overpayment by American families,'' said Sen. William V. Roth Jr.,
R-Del., and chairman of the Finance Committee. ``I would ask those
who oppose this family tax relief: Just how big will America's
budget surplus have to get before America's families deserve to
receive some of their tax dollars back?''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, said the
new surplus projections might allow Congress to phase in some of
the provisions in the bill more quickly than planned. He said House
and Senate negotiators would consider that issue as they work to
reconcile their versions of the legislation this week.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the bill suffered from a truth-in-advertising
problem, since it did not completely eliminate the marriage penalty
and provided a tax cut even to couples, mostly those in which only
one spouse works, who benefit from a marriage bonus _ that is, they
pay a lower tax bill because they are married than they would if
they had remained single.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Democrats said, Republicans had shown once again
that their main goal is to provide tax breaks to upper-income
people, even if doing so required gambling with the country's
economic future on the dubious proposition that the surpluses will
materialize as projected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the surplus projections are the fiscal equivalent
of the dot-com stock market,'' said Sen. Tom Daschle of South
Dakota, the Democratic leader.
</P>
<P>
   Both the House and the Senate have now passed both the tax cut
for married couples and the other main Republican tax bill this
year, the repeal of the federal estate tax. Republicans are also
pressing ahead with other tax bills, including an expansion of
individual retirement accounts and 401(k) retirement plans and a
reduction in the tax levied on some Social Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Although polls have repeatedly found that voters do not see tax
cuts as a priority, Republicans remain wedded to them ideologically
and continue to put them at the heart of their political strategy.
They say that individuals can better decide how to spend the money
than government, and that leaving budget surpluses in Washington
will lead inevitably to an increase in the size and reach of the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to do all we can in terms of allowing the American
people to keep more of their money,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats acknowledged that specific tax cuts, including the
bill passed on Tuesday, have some political appeal, and they are
increasingly offering their own tax agenda that is focused on
providing tax breaks to low- and middle- income people. But they
said the Republicans are heading for political trouble by weighting
their tax cuts heavily toward the wealthy and ignoring middle--
class concerns like the costs of college tuition and child care.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``While I strongly support targeted marriage penalty relief, the
marriage penalty bill put forth by the majority in Congress is one
part of a fiscally irresponsible, poorly targeted and regressive
tax plan,'' Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation passed on Tuesday would increase the standard
deduction for married couples filing jointly, starting next year,
so that it is twice the standard deduction for single taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   The deduction is adjusted each year for inflation. For this
year, the standard deduction for couples filing jointly is $7,350,
or 1.67 times more than the deduction for single people, which is
$4,400. Excluding any change for inflation, the legislation would
increase the deduction for couples filing jointly next year to
$8,800.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also gradually change the income levels covered
by the two lowest income tax brackets, 15 percent and 28 percent,
so that the brackets for married couples filing jointly would grow
to cover twice as much income as for single people.
</P>
<P>
   The brackets change each year to adjust for inflation. For this
year, the 15 percent bracket covers the first $26,250 of income for
single people and 1.67 times more _ $43,850 _ for couples filing
jointly. The 28 percent brackets pick up where the 15 percent
brackets end, and under current law extend to $63,550 for single
people and to 1.67 times more, $105,950, for couples filing
jointly.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would increase the size of the brackets for
couples filing jointly in steps over the next six years until they
cover twice the income levels covered by the brackets for single
people.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also give a tax break to married couples who
claim the earned income tax credit, which is a rebate for
low-income working people. And it would keep certain other tax
credits for families, including the child and dependent care
credits, from being reduced by the alternative minimum tax.
</P>
<P>
   The eight Democrats who voted for the bill were Sens. Joseph
Biden of Delaware, Robert Byrd of West Virginia, Max Cleland of
Georgia, Dianne Feinstein of California, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska,
Herb Kohl of Wisconsin, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Robert
Torricelli of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican who voted against the bill was Sen. George
Voinovich of Ohio.

BLARING LOCOMOTIVE HORNS SPUR A BATTLE IN CONGRESS
</HEADLINE>
 By ERIC SCHMITT  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Never mind that House Speaker Dennis Hastert (R.,
Ill.) has been busy backing Republican election-year bills to cut
taxes and provide prescription drugs to the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, he took up the cudgels to deal with something that
really keeps his constituents up at night, tossing and turning.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare appearance as a star witness at a congressional
hearing, the speaker led a parade of critics who attacked a
proposed federal regulation that would require trains to blow their
horns at railroad crossings, a step to help avoid accidents with
cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impact of the rule on my constituents and the people of
Illinois'' cannot be overstated, Hastert told a House
Transportation and Infrastructure subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Many states have already adopted similar rules. But, in a clash
between public safety and quality of life, a squadron of
legislators and civic leaders complained on Tuesday that the
federal regulation, while well meaning, would unleash a cacophony
of klaxons in hundreds of cities, towns and hamlets along rail
lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crossings along many lines are located so closely together
that train engineers might as well tape the horn button down: there
will be simply no break in the noise,'' said Miguel d'Escoto,
deputy chief of staff to Chicago's mayor, Richard M. Daley. ``The
mental stress and strain on our residents will be unimaginable.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 400 people a year die in collisions at railroad
crossings. Half the fatalities occur at crossings already equipped
with gates and flashing lights, which drivers sometimes ignore.
</P>
<P>
   To address the hazard, Congress passed a law in 1994 mandating
that trains toot their horns as they approach rail crossings. But
it was only this January, after several delays, that the Federal
Railroad Administration published the proposed rule to carry out
the law. The proposal is now being subjected to a period of public
comment, and the railroad agency hopes to have the issue resolved
by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, 34 states and scores of local communities had
already approved their own whistle-blowing statutes, which
incorporated alternatives to the ear-splitting warnings.
</P>
<P>
   But the railroad agency questioned some of these options, citing
a 1995 study that showed crashes are 84 percent more likely to
occur at crossings where whistles are banned than at crossings
where horns routinely sound.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever there are passenger or freight trains, from Long Island
and New Jersey to San Diego, the issue of horns versus harmony has
roiled communities. But nowhere is the matter as contentious as it
is in and around Chicago, a hub of the nation's rail operations.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago transportation experts say that train whistles blaring
at 85 decibels or louder would rattle about 725,000 city residents,
with the brunt falling on poor neighborhoods near the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   And that is why Hastert, who represents Illinois' 14th
Congressional District, just west of Chicago, is involved. One of
out of every five railroad crossings in Illinois is in the
speaker's district.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert and other critics of the rule want the federal agency to
give local communities more flexibility in devising quieter means
to meet the safety standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must reserve a whistle-free option for our communities,''
Rep. Gil Gutknecht (R.-Minn.), said at the hearing on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, the railroad administration would accept as
substitutes for horn-blowing a range of safety measures, from
four-gate crossings and median barriers to photo enforcement and
closing rail crossings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many ways to skin this cat,'' said John V. Wells,
the agency's administrator. ``We are well aware that this is a
controversial issue.''
</P>
<P>
   But many of these options are costly and a drain on the coffers
of small towns. A flashing-signal system can cost $60,000, the
Transportation Department says, and a gate across one lane can cost
$15,000. An overpass can run $2 million to $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Even as states like Illinois move to replace simple
``crossbuck'' railroad crossing signs, funding to fix these most
dangerous rail-auto intersections may be siphoned away, critics
warned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposed rule could actually have the unintended
consequence of decreasing rail safety,'' Hastert said, because
states would spend so much money placating residents of populous
areas, smaller towns would not have enough financing to fix
problems at their dangerous rail crossings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public pressure to shield highly populated communities from
noise will undoubtedly overcome the need to upgrade the dangerous
crossings,'' Hastert said.

BACK TO THE FUTURE: DRIVE-IN MOVIES MAKING COMEBACK

<P>
   ABILENE, Texas _ The rebirth of the Town and Country Drive-In
made Henry Perez feel 20 years younger.
</P>
<P>
   As a brilliant evening sky of pinks and blues surrounded the
theater's 100-foot-screen on Saturday night, Perez extolled the
virtues of the drive-in and shared memories with his wife, Leslie.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not in a box with walls on either side,'' the
41-year-old Perez said. ``And you've got the West Texas sunset.''
</P>
<P>
   The reopening of the Town and Country 11 days ago is another
sign, enthusiasts say, of a drive-in resurgence after decades of
ever-declining numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time is right,'' said its owner, Ray Andress. ``Everybody
wants to return to the good old days, and this is as close as some
of us are going to get to that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Perezes are a perfect example. They were regulars at the
Town and Country before it closed in September 1981. This time,
they brought along two teen-age daughters and a couple of nieces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came all the time back then _ and we watched the movie,''
Perez said, gesturing in the direction of his daughters who already
knew the lore of drive-ins as notorious make-out spots.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, two other drive-ins have flickered back to
life. In August, the Tower Drive-In in Rule, 70 miles northwest of
Abilene, which is 150 miles west of Fort Worth, returned after the
community rallied to rebuild its tornado-ravaged screen.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in 1999, Amarillo's Tascosa Drive-In also opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fact that one opened in Abilene and another in
Amarillo is good,'' said Fort Worth native Don Sanders, who
co-authored ``Drive-In Movie Memories'' with his wife, Susan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1995, there have probably been 30 drive-ins reopen or
built from scratch across the country,'' said Sanders, who
maintains a drive-in Web site, www.americandrivein.com. ``I think
the tone has really changed, and we now know they're always going
to be around. There was a time when we couldn't have said that.''
</P>
<P>
   In North Texas, only two remain, Granbury's Brazos Drive-In
southwest of Fort Worth and the Graham Drive-In, northwest. Dallas'
Astro Drive-In never reopened after its concession stand burned
down in 1998. The Mansfield Drive-In in southeast Fort Worth,
Tarrant County's last outdoor theater, disappeared in the early
'90s.
</P>
<P>
   Abilene's Town and Country could easily have followed a similar
path. A fence fell down, a pond in the middle of the parking lot
became a sinkhole and one of its two screens was torn down.
</P>
<P>
   The only signs of life were the vagrants who used the concession
stand as their home and the pump jacks sucking oil from below the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a lot of work just getting open,'' said the
45-year-old Andress, who has sunk $200,000 into the Town and
Country, where he worked as a projectionist in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concession stand was condemned. We had to fight with the
oil company who owned the pump jacks'' and opposed the theater's
reopening, he said. ``But I never lost faith that we would open.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenda Thornton, his business partner and girlfriend, wasn't
always so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we did didn't make it look any better,'' Thornton
said. ``There were times I hated that place. I threw horrible
temper tantrums but finally it started looking better.''
</P>
<P>
   After the opening, Thornton's mood brightened as she greeted
customers at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   ``They show up and don't even know what's showing, and they
don't care,'' Thornton said. ``They just want to come in and take a
look.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple is promoting the theater as family entertainment in
conservative Abilene, home to three church-related universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that everybody know we're a family-type
business,'' Thornton said. ``We're in Abilene, Texas, and we got
more churches than anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   To attract a budget-conscious crowd, Andress has set concession
prices lower than his indoor competitors. At $2.25, a jumbo popcorn
costs about half what it does at an indoor theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting known as the `50-cent pickle man' for our cheap
pickles,'' Andress said. ``I want people to be able to come out and
have a hamburger or some nachos and not break the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   For those more interested in the movie, Andress is broadcasting
digital and Dolby sound into car radios. He is also thinking about
reviving recent hits like ``The Matrix'' during slower weeknights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm willing to try anything that will bring people out,'' said
Andress, former United Artists sound technician and projectionist,
warming to the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking of putting in a bandstand below the screen. I'm
thinking of putting in outdoor seats. I want to have a night for
the neighborhood who lives around the theater. I want to be known
as a promoter.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, the drive-in authority, suggested that a friendly
ambience will be as important as what's on the screen at the Town
and Country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been to the Brazos in Granbury seven or eight times and
never watched the movie,'' Sanders said. ``The last time I was
there I talked to two Elvis experts from Euless for two and a half
hours. Now I'll probably never talk to them again, but that was
fun. And that's what drive-ins are all about.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With rising oil and natural gas prices squeezing
nearly every household, the Consumer Price Index jumped by 0.6 of a
percent in June, the Labor Department reported Tuesday. But apart
from energy, inflation remained mild.
</P>
<P>
   Natural gas is the heating fuel for most homes and commercial
buildings, and gas prices shot up by 7.8 percent, the biggest one
month increase since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began tracking
them in 1952. With inventories depleted, the price jump reflected
fear of shortages this winter, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street focused on the narrower core rate of inflation _
which excludes energy and food, two areas where prices jump around
from month to month. This core rate was up only 0.2 percent in
June, matching the increase in four of the five previous months.
</P>
<P>
   Still, core inflation, which many view as providing a better
indicator of underlying inflationary pressures, has edged up
gradually since last year. For the 12 months ended in June, the
rise was 2.4 percent, compared with 1.9 percent in 1999. Some
economists argue that in a still robust economy, where demand is
sufficient to allow companies to raise prices on certain goods and
services, the oil price shock may speed up the increase in core
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risks are all toward a gradual acceleration of
inflation,'' said Jan Hatzius, an economist at Goldman, Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   Rising rents, for example, helped to push up housing costs by
0.5 percent last month, although natural gas accounted for most of
the increase. Airline fares rose by 1.5 percent, with higher fuel
costs cited as a justification. But demand played a role, analysts
said. Without so much ticket-buying, the higher fares might not
have stuck, and the rising cost of fuel would have come out of
profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to assess whether fuel prices are driving up
fares, or fully booked flights,'' said Patrick Jackman, a senior
economist at the Bureau's Consumer Price division.
</P>
<P>
   Stock market investors seemed to find in the June report on
consumer prices a reason for the Federal Reserve to increase
interest rates at its next policymaking meeting, on Aug. 22 _
although more data on the economy will be forthcoming in the next
five weeks, including the July consumer price report. Rate
increases fight inflation by slowing the economy, and fresh
expectations of higher rates tend to push down stock prices, at
least for a day or two.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell Tuesday by 64.35 points,
to 10,739.92, and the Nasdaq composite index dropped by 97.50
points, or 2.3 percent, to 4,177.17.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration focused on the core rate in June. In
a statement, Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said, ``Core consumer
prices remain moderate despite pressure from energy prices.'' The
administration has insisted that the booming economy is not
inflationary _ suggesting in effect that the Fed should go easy on
interest rates. Six Fed rate increases since June 1999 have already
helped to produce a mild slowing of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Energy prices are not easily held in check by interest rate
increases. Rate increases are intended to discourage borrowing and
spending, thus diluting demand, particularly among consumers. But
oil prices have risen because of OPEC's decision 16 months ago to
restrict production, a restriction just now being lifted. Consumer
demand played no role.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are hard pressed to see the energy prices passed along
yet, or workers able to demand wage increases to keep up with price
increases,'' said Dean Baker, an economist at the Center for
Economic and Policy Research in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Baker and others argue against further interest rate increases
on the ground that the worst of the energy price increases are
over. The 8.8 percent rise in gasoline in June, to $1.66 a gallon,
on average, is not likely to be repeated in July. Weekly reports
from the Department of Energy say that gasoline prices hit a peak
on June 19 and have since declined _ although natural gas prices
are likely to continue to rise until inventories are rebuilt,
Jackman said.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, see in the oil shock an important role for the
Fed. Their argument is that rising fuel prices must reverberate
through a strong economy _ for example, encouraging workers in a
period of low unemployment to demand higher wages to keep up with
their rising fuel bills. These would then be passed along in price
increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The labor market is tight as a drum, the economy is growing
like a bandit and this is not the time to be tolerant of oil price
shocks,'' said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter. He pointed to several surveys in which many business
executives said they planned to raise prices this year.
</P>
<P>
   A service sector index published by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics, one that excludes energy, rose at an annual rate of 3.7
percent over the first six months of this year, up from 2.7 percent
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Still, energy dominated the 0.6 percent June increase in the
consumer price index, the largest increase since a 0.7 percent rise
in March. Energy certainly contributed to the rising cost of
maintaining a home _ not only the increase in natural gas but also
an 0.8 percent rise in electricity bills. But outside housing and
transportation, the only major jump in prices came in medical care,
particularly hospital bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medical care costs have started to accelerate somewhat,''
Jackman noted. For the 12 months ending in June, they were up 4.1
percent, compared with 3.7 percent in 1999. ``Hospital charges are
the major story,'' Jackman said, ``not what people pay their
private physicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, apparel prices fell again, as they have most of this
year. Discounting accounted for much of the decline. Food prices
rose a mild 0.1 percent, mostly because of higher prices for beef
and fresh vegetables. Recreation costs rose 0.3 percent, with most
of the increase in the prices of movie and theater tickets, and
entry to sports events. New vehicle prices edged down 0.1 percent,
while used vehicles rose by 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco prices fell, the result of discounting. Education costs
jumped 0.8 percent, reflecting increases in tuition fees at private
secondary schools. But telephone services fell in price. So did
computers and computer equipment, and products that use oil as a
raw material _ plastics, for example, and other petrochemicals _
did not rise in price. Indeed, an index of commodity prices, less
food and energy, shows no change from last year, the Bureau of
Labor Statistics reported.
</P>
<P>
   Global competition, oversupply and a strong dollar, which dampen
import prices, all played a role. ``The indirect effect of
energy,'' Jackman said, ``has so far been muted.''

 &HT;    Cowboys open training camp workouts with a spiffy new offense
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas - By the end of a two-hour practice
Tuesday, Troy Aikman was dripping with sweat, fatigued from
throwing deep pass after deep pass to Joey Galloway and Rocket
Ismail.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we keep throwing into the wind like this, I'm not going to
have an arm left by the end of training camp,'' the Dallas Cowboys
quarterback said on the first day of summer workouts under the
unforgiving Texas sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman threw long and intermediate passes to a group of
receivers all trying to make a positive impression.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the same offense now-departed Coach Chan Gailey ran
the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Everything is different. Blocking patterns have changed. Pass
routes have changed. Aikman now throws timing passes that were so
successful during the Super Bowl glory days. There are very few of
the short routes that ruined Gailey's regime.
</P>
<P>
   The new architect: Jack Reilly, a former Cowboys assistant and
new Cowboys offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack Reilly is a riverboat gambler,'' head coach Dave Campo
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times, I thought we were conservative in the old days. We
got set in what we could do. Jack is more unpredictable in his
play-calling, which will be a plus for us. I want to be
unpredictable.''
</P>
<P>
   Those should be refreshing words for anyone who watched the
Cowboys finish 16th in the NFL in total offense last season. After
a good start, Gailey's offense died in November and December, and
he was released after the Cowboys made an early playoff exit.
</P>
<P>
   Team owner Jerry Jones vowed that would not happen again.
</P>
<P>
   Jones made some aggressive moves this year, hiring Campo and
Reilly and bringing back offensive guru Ernie Zampese as a
consultant. He lured Galloway from Seattle to add speed to the
offense, and signed veteran tight end Jackie Harris from Tennessee
as another possible weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 priority of training camp is to revitalize the
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The object is to score points, whatever it takes,'' Reilly
said. ``If that means running the ball, fine. But we want to be
aggressive and go after people with both the running game and the
passing game.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman has praised the offense, which allows him to run designed
plays rather than being forced to improvise.
</P>
<P>
   The timing-based offense the Cowboys have employed was designed
30 years ago by former San Diego Chargers coach Don Coryell. With
Hall of Famer Dan Fouts at quarterback, the offense was wildly
successful. Other teams, including Washington and Dallas,
eventually copied the schemes. St. Louis used a similar attack in
its Super Bowl victory over Tennessee this year.
</P>
<P>
   No player appeared more excited about the offense than Harris,
who signed with the Cowboys shortly after the Titans were beaten in
the Super Bowl. In Dallas, Harris sees an opportunity to work with
a quarterback whose passing accuracy has never been debated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played in some offenses where the quarterback doesn't see
you,'' Harris said after Tuesday's practice. ``I was running down
the sideline in mini-camp, and I know Troy didn't see me, and all
of a sudden the ball was right there. The guy sees the field so
well. If you get open, you'd better be prepared to catch the ball
because he's going to find you.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo set the tone in camp by demanding an up-tempo practice.
Galloway and Ismail ensure that Dallas will have one of the fastest
receiver tandems in the league. The coach wants everyone on both
sides of the football to keep their motors running at all times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm well aware that offenses bring people into the stands,''
Campo said. ``I understand what offenses mean in this league. There
is no question that when you look throughout the league, the team
with the most points wins. I'm excited about this.''
</P>
<P>
   So is his boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team, with young talent coupled with an effective Troy
Aikman, can get it all,'' Jones said. ``I say that without
reservation.''

ONE HURDLE LEFT BEFORE BUCHANAN ASSUMES CONTROL OF REFORM PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After months of aggressive efforts to place his loyalists in key
positions on the Reform Party's national committee and as state
delegates to the party's nominating convention next month, Pat
Buchanan is poised to take full control of a party he joined less
than a year ago after abandoning his Republican roots.
</P>
<P>
   His ultimate triumph depends on what happens at a special
session of the Reform national committee, planned for Aug. 8, the
day before the party's convention opens in Long Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   There, if the final pieces fall into place, as expected, the
party's governing board will ratify a Buchanan ally as head of the
convention's credentials committee, virtually assuring that most
disputes over the seating of delegates will be resolved in
Buchanan's favor.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly. the move will mark a major turning point in
the party's brief and turbulent history, effectively ending Ross
Perot's control, power and influence over a political organization
he founded eight years ago as an alternative to Republicans and
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   It would clear Buchanan's path to the Reform Party's
presidential nomination and the $12.5 million in federal campaign
funds that goes with it.
</P>
<P>
   And it would give Buchanan, for the first time, a home for his
own well-organized, deep-rooted, right-wing political machine to
promote socially conservative causes, like opposition to abortion
rights, that Perot's Reform Party left out of the platform as too
divisive.
</P>
<P>
   While critics of Buchanan say his vision of the Reform Party
would, in effect, pick up where the Christian Coalition left off,
his mission could receive substantial lifts in the months ahead.
His efforts would no doubt be aided if Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, the all-but-named Republican nominee, chooses a vice
presidential running mate who favors abortion rights, alienating
staunchly conservative Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   And if Buchanan collects at least 5 percent of the popular vote
in the general election, the Reform Party would qualify for federal
campaign funds in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the key for Buchanan is final recognition at the
party's special session of Frank Reed as chairman of the
convention's credentials committee, a 15-member panel that decides
who are seated as convention delegates.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the panel's job is especially critical. Reflecting
the polarizing effect Buchanan has had on the party, the committee
has received 40 challenges from 26 states, the resolution of which
could affect hundreds of the 596 delegates and dozens of the 164
members of the national committee, some of whom are also delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, the party chairman in Ohio and chairman of the convention
rules committee, is considered a Buchanan supporter. But it remains
unclear just who is recognized as the head of the credentials
committee. Gerald R. Moan, the party's acting chairman since last
winter, originally appointed two people _ Dot Drew, a party
official from North Carolina and a long-time Perot supporter, and
Kelly Abt of Texas, a staunch Buchanan supporter. Later, Moan
removed Abt, replacing him with Russell J. Verney, a close
associate of Perot. But then he removed Verney and appointed Reed
as sole chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the 11-member executive committee overruled Moan,
voting to remove Reed and naming Drew as the sole chairwoman. But
Moan has not recognized the executive committee's action, leaving
the matter to be resolved at the Aug. 8 meeting.
</P>
<P>
   For the Buchanan campaign, the naming of Reed as credentials
chairman would appear to be the last component to a strategy
intended to safeguard the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's efforts to tie up all loose ends follow months of
contention within the party, largely as a result of his power play.
While his efforts to gain control of state delegations have
fortified his chances of winning the nomination, they have also
offended many party members who cherished Perot's founding
principles that focused on government reform and trade issues and
ignored social policy.
</P>
<P>
   For some time, Perot did not rule out a third run for the
presidency himself. He even tried to have the primary ballot offer
voters a third choice, that of ``no endorsement,'' which was widely
perceived as a signal to his loyalists that nominating no one was
better than the choice at hand.
</P>
<P>
   After Perot's request was denied, Buchanan was left only to
overcome John Hagelin, a physicist and obscure political figure who
has twice run for president under the banner of the Natural Law
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Some Reform leaders who are skeptical of Buchanan's motives
contend that the real reason for the Aug. 8 meeting, which was
called by 50 national committee members loyal to him, is that the
Buchanan campaign intends to orchestrate the removal of Moan and
replace him with someone who it believes would project a stronger
and more stable ruling style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us think Gerry has been more than fair to the Buchanan
campaign,'' said a senior party official who asked not to be named.
``But they don't trust him. He has not been with Pat long enough,
so no matter what he does, they're going to dump him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bay Buchanan, who serves as chief strategist for her brother's
campaign, denied that driving Moan from office was part of the
campaign strategy. Moan, she insisted, proved his value when he
removed Verney as credentials chairman and named Reed.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the convention is run in a manner that is fair to
all delegations, I don't see any need for the national committee to
interfere with any officer,'' she said. ``And there is no need to
remove him.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she and Moan both acknowledged that a number of national
committee members who are ardent Buchanan backers would feel more
comfortable with a chairman who has demonstrated unambiguous
allegiance to Buchanan and the direction he would take the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``My perception is they don't have the votes, and the sentiment
to remove me is not there,'' Moan said of any opponents, though he
conceded that his days in office might be numbered. ``I think I've
been more than fair to both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Verney predicted that if Buchanan supporters vote to
replace Moan with a chairman more closely aligned with Buchanan,
the Hagelin campaign would file for an injunction in federal court
to hold up dispensation of the federal election funds to the
Buchanan campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every judge has been appointed by a Republican or Democrat,
and the Federal Election Commission is not rushing to send out any
money,'' Verney said. ``That process could take a long time to
resolve.''

MYANMAR'S CHILD REBEL LEADERS LANGUISH IN THAI JUNGLE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ The rains have come and spirits are a little
low for God's Army, the rag-tag Burmese insurgency that draws its
inspiration from twin 12-year-old soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Coughing, scratching themselves and seeming a little bewildered
by the world around them, the boys met in a jungle camp recently
with an American journalist and complained that they were short of
food and supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Swinging short machetes, the boys were helping to build bamboo
and thatch huts in a clearing when the journalist, Jason Bleibtreu,
having trekked through the mountains, arrived to photograph and
film them as he had done once before, in April.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their claims of supernatural powers, the boys, Johnny
and Luther Htoo, seemed as passive and childlike as ever, relying
on a sort of nanny named Rambo to help them answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   Bleibtreu: ``What are your plans now?''
</P>
<P>
   Rambo to Johnny: ``We still have our plans. Tell him.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny: ``Now? We still have our plans.''
</P>
<P>
   God's Army made headlines in January when 10 of its members
staged a suicidal raid on a hospital in the Thai border town of
Ratchaburi, holding hostage more than 800 patients and medical
workers before being shot dead by security forces.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, remnants of the group of no more than 200 fighters
have been on the run from both Thai troops and the forces of
Myanmar, the former Burma, where they are a splinter faction of an
ethnic Karen insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   But they told Bleibtreu that the little camp where he met them
in a remote stretch of mountains was in fact just inside the border
of Thailand. It seemed for the moment that even their pursuers had
lost interest in them.
</P>
<P>
   A number of the fighters apparently have drifted away to refugee
camps along the border that shelter Karen civilians fleeing the
conflict inside Myanmar. No more than 30 fighters _ half of them
teen-age boys _ accompanied the twins in their jungle camp.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in military-style fatigues but looking frail and
undernourished in Bleibtreu's videotape, the boys spent most of
their energy smoking fat cheroots. At one point, Johnny sucked
alternately on two of them, one in each hand.
</P>
<P>
   On his previous visit, Bleibtreu met only with Luther. This
time, with both boys present, he said he detected a hint of sibling
rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luther was moody and looked like he was a little bit upset
that Johnny was getting the attention this time,'' Bleibtreu said.
``Between the two of them, Johnny is a brighter bulb, more
talkative and outgoing. When I started paying attention to Johnny,
Luther got up and left and was in a bad mood.''
</P>
<P>
   More than once when he was filming Luther, Bleibtreu said, the
child raised a machete at him in what seemed to be a threatening
way.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny also seemed edgy about the attention his brother had
received.
</P>
<P>
   Bleibtreu: ``What kind of weapons do you like?''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny to Rambo: ``Did he ask these questions during his last
visit?''
</P>
<P>
   Rambo: ``He asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny: ``What was the answer?''
</P>
<P>
   As with most of Bleibtreu's questions _ on both visits _ there
never was a coherent answer. It was not clear that the boys had
much of an idea what the journalist was doing there or what an
interview was all about.
</P>
<P>
   The uneducated sons of a peasant farmer, they have been
venerated as the reincarnations of ancient Karen heroes since they
were small boys and their words are received as the wisdom of
oracles.
</P>
<P>
   They _ or their followers _ claim that the boys command 400,000
invisible soldiers, and that they can change shape, predict the
future and walk through minefields unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   It is a strange life for a small boy to be carried everywhere on
the shoulders of armed men and handed a lit cheroot whenever he
murmurs, ``I want a smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems a lonely life as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we would like to see our parents,'' Johnny said.
</P>
<P>
   And he looked on listlessly from his regal perch on Rambo's lap
as a group of armed boys raced through the campsite, as if at a
summer camp, playing a game of tag.
</P>
<P>
   Bleibtreu: ``What games do you like to play?''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny: ``I don't know how to play.''

<P>
   Extreme Championship Wrestling's latest pay-per-view was the
organization's best this year and should help in head man Paul
Heyman's search for a new television home for the weekly show.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which was filmed before a sellout crowd of 6,000 in
Los Angeles, went back to the foul-language, over-the-top sexuality
and bloody wrestling tactics that helped put ECW on the
professional wrestling map. Here are some of the highlights:
</P>
<P>
   Best match of the night was the war between Steve Corino and
Jerry Lynn. Corino continues to look like a young Barry Windham
(from his Florida Championship Wrestling days) pouring out his
blood and putting his opponents over. The highlight of the match
occurred when Lynn used Corino's blood to write ``DIE'' on his
chest. Lynn has always been a good wrestler, but has lacked the
microphone and personality skills to get over the top. His feud
with Corino might just do that.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum was the match between Balls
Mahoney and Big Sal. It was quick and lacked any heat. Another
reason for the poor match could be that Mahoney is getting ready to
leave ECW. Since his tour of Japan, Mahoney has seen his stock
plummet. He might make the jump for West Coast rival XFW soon.
</P>
<P>
   The best promo of the night had to be Rhino's attack on the
Sandman before their match. During the attack, Rhino grabbed
Sandman's injured wife and tried to stuff her head-first down the
toilet before security stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   Rhino also had a hand in the craziest move of the night. Still
recovering from knee surgery, Spike Dudley tried to help Sandman
during his match with Rhino. For sticking his nose into the match,
Dudley was piledriven by Rhino off the ring apron, through a table
and onto the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The return of the night was Dawn Marie. She has been missing
since her wrestler Lance Storm jumped to WCW last month. She
returned as part of the announcing crew.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise of the night was Francine losing her top.
</P>
<P>
   _ ECW's next CD of entrance themes is set for release in
September. It will be ``Extreme Music Volume II: ECW Anarchy
Rulz.'' Some of the songs included are: Spike Dudley's theme song,
``Highway to Hell'' by Jesse James Dupree; New Jack's theme song,
``Natural Born Killaz'' by F.M. Racket; Steve Corino's theme song,
``Welcome Burden'' by Disturbed; and Mikey Whipwreck's theme song,
``Head'' by Static-X.
</P>
<P>
   _ The World Wrestling Federation's online auction (on wwf.com)
has had some big money sales so far. Triple H's outfit (tights,
trunks and elbow pads) from ``Summerslam '98'' went for over
$2,000; as did Stone Cold Steve Austin's autographed knee brace.
All the proceeds, which could reach into six-figures, are going to
charity.
</P>
<P>
   _ WWF fans at the recent ``Raw'' show in Albany, N.Y. got an
extra treat. After Raw went off the air, Triple H and Chris Jericho
actually started a match. After Triple H ripped off Jericho's
bandages, Jericho reversed an abdominal strech and hit a
``Lionsalt'' for the win.
</P>
<P>
   _ She didn't marry a millionaire on television, but Chyna should
have Playboy magazines selling at a record pace when her pictorial
appears in the men's magazine's November issue.
</P>
<P>
   _ More bad news for WCW. Despite claims from the announcers that
attendance at the ``Bash at the Beach'' pay-per-view was over
16,000, the official number was 4,400.
</P>
<P>
   _ More word leaking out this week that the Vince Russo-Hulk
Hogan flap at ``the Beach'' was fake. Also, reports say Hogan must
make only seven more appearences for WCW.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ric Flair's recent neck surgery went well and he could return
in about three months.

ARMY EXONERATES OFFICERS IN DEATH OF GAY SOLDIER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky., Mo.)   By ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An Army investigation of events surrounding the
murder of a gay private by a fellow soldier at a base in Kentucky
has exonerated all officers of blame and concluded that no climate
of homophobia exists at the base, Pentagon officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, Pfc. Barry Winchell, 21, was bludgeoned to death with
a baseball bat as he slept in his barracks at Fort Campbell. A
19-year-old private, Calvin Glover, was later court-martialed and
sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder. Spc. Justin R.
Fisher, 26, Winchell's roommate, was sentenced to 12{ years as part
of a plea bargain that allowed him to avoid more serious charges of
being an accomplice to the murder and helping to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   The Army, stung by accusations that it was not punishing
harassment of gays, opened an investigation into the atmosphere at
Fort Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   The product that investigation, conducted by the Army's
inspector general, Lt. Gen. Michael Ackerman, is expected to be
released on Friday. , It states that some members of the unit in
which the killing occurred, a company within the 101st Airborne
division, held anti-gay attitudes. In particular, it singles out
Winchell's first sergeant, who has since been relieved of his
duties, of not putting an end to the harassment.
</P>
<P>
   But the report, whose conclusions were first reported by CBS
News, also concludes that the 101st Airborne does not suffer from
an unacceptable degree of homophobia, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it described a sort of upstairs-downstairs mentality at
the base in which instances of harassment were not brought to the
attention of those in command who might have stopped it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of times when the problem never surfaced up
the chain of command,'' said one Pentagon official. ``But when the
leadership discovered the problem action was taken.''
</P>
<P>
   Winchell's mother, Patricia Kutteles, a registered nurse from
Kansas City, Mo., was quick to accuse the Army of a cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just so disappointed, really, really disappointed,'' she
said Tuesday in a telephone interview. ``It's been so devastating.
To me it seems as if the Pentagon brass and the command is more
concerned about protecting themselves than the safety of our
soldiers. The Army should face up to what is going on instead of
covering up for the command climate.''
</P>
<P>
   In the background, Wally Kutteles, her husband and Winchell's
stepfather, who served in the Korean War, chimed in, ``They're
trying to sweep it under the rug.''
</P>
<P>
   They have filed a claim against the Army under the Military
Claims Act for wrongful death and are seeking $1.4 million in
damages based on Winchell's loss of earning potential. The
Washington-based law firm of Covington &AMP; Burling is handling the
case without compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle M. Benecke, co-director of the Servicemembers Legal
Defense Network, an organization that provides legal aid to gays in
the military, also criticized the pending report.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Army report denies anti-gay harassment is a problem at
Fort Campbell, then the report does not have a shred of
credibility,'' she said. ``There is more than ample evidence of
anti-gay harassment, despite a process that foreclosed the
participation of gay soldiers. Army leaders need to deal with this
problem head on, and stop the harassment.''
</P>
<P>
   Benecke said her group interviewed 20 soldiers at Fort Campbell,
and discovered that ``anti-gay harassment and threats are as common
as the uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   She characterized the murder as a hate crime rooted in
homophobia; the Pentagon treated it as a simple case of murder of a
soldier by a soldier.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials on Tuesday defended the integrity of their
pending report. ``I'm not saying that harassment hasn't occurred,''
a Pentagon official said. ``But it is an exaggeration to think that
every gay at the base is being harassed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army investigation coincides with a second report by a
Pentagon advisory group created by Defense Secretary William Cohen
after the Pentagon's inspector general stated last March that
harassment of servicemen perceived to be homosexuals was widespread
throughout the military. The report is supposed to serve as an
``action plan'' for each of the military services to address the
problem of harassment of gays in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Among its recommendations is the refinement of training for
service members of different ranks on how to properly carry out the
Clinton administration's policy of ``don't ask, don't tell'' which
allows gay men and lesbians to serve in the military provided they
keep their sexual orientation a secret and do not engage in
homosexual acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The training about ``don't ask, don't tell'' is a servicewide
problem,'' said one Pentagon official. ``One class doesn't fit
every rank.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army inspector general's investigation at Fort Campbell was
requested by Maj. Gen. Robert T. Clark, who was commander of the
101st Airborne at the time of the murder, and who was reassigned to
the Pentagon and made vice director of operations for the Joint
Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   The report concludes that Clark should be not be held
responsible for the murder. In fact, it reinforces his own
statements made on the day he left his command.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not, nor has there ever been during my times here, a
climate of homophobia on post,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Glover's trial in December, soldiers testified that Winchell
had been taunted for months with name-calling, rumor-mongering and
an inquiry into his private life that was supposed to be forbidden
under military policy.
</P>
<P>
   The trial also laid bare the flaws in the Clinton
administration's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy. Critics contend
that instead of making life easier for gays and lesbians in the
armed services, the policy leaves many to suffer in silence and
fear or leave the service.

 &HT;    Jordan checks out Open course, picks Webb as favorite
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GURNEE, Ill. - The Merit Club's most famous member played three
holes Tuesday with Nancy Lopez, Laura Davies and Michelle McGann,
then gave his assessment of the course for the 55th U.S. Women's
Open Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a good test for the women,'' Michael Jordan
said. ``I think it would be a good test for the men. If the wind
kicks up, it can be really, really tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan received tremendous ovations as he played in this
northern Chicago suburb, but said hitting a tee shot in front of
fans ``is a lot more intimidating than me making a free throw.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was humbled playing with three great players in a
short exhibition _ he lost a ball on the first hole _ Jordan said,
``I don't need much humbling. I know I'm a hack.''
</P>
<P>
   However, his best score here is a 69.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's three years ago when I didn't really have a job,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Now running the Washington Wizards, Jordan said he hasn't been
able to play as much golf as he'd like and is struggling with a
closed club on top that is causing a hook.
</P>
<P>
   He picked Karrie Webb as the favorite here, but ``would not rule
out Juli Inkster. This is a putter's course.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan also talked basketball, refusing to comment on the Bulls,
but praising North Carolina's decision to hire Matt Doherty as head
coach. Why not him?
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaching is not my bag,'' Jordan said. ``I don't think I have
the patience to sit down on the sidelines and yell and scream. I
like to do it at home in the confines of my own house.''
</P>
<P>
   Scheduling blues
</P>
<P>
   Inkster, the defending champion, said it was bad timing to hold
the Women's Open the same week as the British Open. ``I kind of
feel sorry for the PGA,'' she said, ``because we're going to take
their press. Maybe we'll throw them a few bones.'' All kidding
aside, Inkster said, ``I wish it wasn't up against the British
Open, but ... this is our biggest tournament of the year, and we're
just going to have to go out there and play some good golf and
bring the media to us.''
</P>
<P>
   More money is coming to them, thanks to an increase in the purse
from $1.75 million to $2.75 million, with the winner earning
$500,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a statement for women's golf and for the USGA that
they think we deserve to be playing for _ maybe not as much as the
men _ but the most we're playing for on tour,'' Inkster said.
</P>
<P>
   Practice, practice
</P>
<P>
   Davies admits that she's practicing more because of Webb (four
victories this year) and Annika Sorenstam (five victories).
</P>
<P>
   ``Because they are doing what they're doing, I'm not good enough
any more and I need to be better,'' said Davies, who added she's
been on the range more Tuesdays this year than in her career.
</P>
<P>
   But she's not practicing that much. ``Not ridiculously,'' Davies
said. ``I would never spend a day out there.'' She paused for
laughter. ``I've already become too professional.''

   ARCHITECTURE-VENICE-BIENNALE (Venice) _ The Venice Biennale's
Seventh International Architecture Exhibition features the latest
strain to emerge in architecture in recent years: ``blob'' design,
produced with the aid of animation software. Biomorphic and
invertebrate, blobs look like things you would expect to see rising
from an electronic version of the primordial ooze. But a small

   FILM-LECONTE (Paris) _ Patrice Leconte has averaged one feature

completed one feature _ the period piece ``The Widow of
Saint-Pierre,'' with Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil _ and is
filming ``Felix et Lola'' with Charlotte Gainsbourg and Philippe
Torreton. In his spare time, he makes commercials. ``The Girl on

   MUSIC-JARRE-FILM (Undated) _ Michael Beckerman says he is

Schubert. To create the main musical theme, Jarre has played the
first phrase of the Schubert Fantasy in F Minor without notes 6-15,
the added a new expansive phrase. The Schubert fantasy is a
particularly compelling choice for ``Sunshine'' because the opening
suggests a Hungarian Gypsy origin, appropriate for the film set
over three generations of one family in Hungary.

other parts of Europe, art was still reflecting the power of kings

   TV-COPS-RUSSIA (St. Petersburg, Russia) _ In the last two years,
St. Petersburg has become the hottest location for the hottest
trend on Russian television: gritty, tell-it-like-it-is cop shows.
The boom began in early 1998 with ``The Street of Broken
Streetlights,'' a St. Petersburg version of ``Hill Street Blues.''
Now, in its wake, half a dozen mini-series are being shot or are on

   TV-BURNETT-SURVIVOR (Undated) _ Mark Burnett may not be liked by
everybody, but he has survived the entertainment world. The
40-year-old British native landed in Los Angeles in 1982, moved
from au pair work to telemarketing, insurance and credit card sales
before being inspired by a Tony Robbins motivational seminar. He
has since developed two winning entertainment vehicles in
remarkably little time by Hollywood standards. Over the last five
years MTV, ESPN and the Discovery Channel have spent $100 million,
by his estimate, on his ``Eco-Challenge Expedition Race.'' Now he
is producing ``Survivor,'' the latest in what he promises will be a
stream of adventure-related businesses and programming combining a
blend of drama and reality he calls ``dramality.'' By Alica Ault.

   TRAVEL-JERUSALEM-HOTELS (Jerusalem) _ Jerusalem is not an
ordinary city and this is not an ordinary guide to hotels there.
William Orme Jr. makes discerning recommendations in a 3,000-word
piece full of details about decor, history, service and discounts.
The hotels visited included: the Olive Tree, a Holy Land theme inn;
the American Colony, an 84-room compound developed from a
19th-century pasha's manse; and the King David, which for true
self-indulgence, he concludes, is Jerusalem's best luxury hotel. He
even recommends the hotel's promotional film in which employees
recall everything from the 1946 bombing of its west wing to the
pyramid cake they baked for Anwar Sadat in 1977. With photo.

son, John, to Florianopolis, Brazil, for training sessions and
matches planned by his coach, Paulo Barreto. In between games, John
and his teammates had time for sandboarding and exchanging e-mail

enjoying lime drinks on the hotel veranda, ecological walks and
watching games played on sand as white as baby powder.

   TRAVEL-TEENS (Undated) _ Based on first-hand experience from
five trips, Jill Abramson has advice for parents traveling with
teen-agers. In London, avoid the British Museum and Parliament, but
visit the Tower of London and war rooms because teen-agers like
gory stuff and they have seen enough World War II movies to make
Whitehall interesting. In Paris, she reports that her daughter took
in the Louvre in less than two hours, but loved going to a movie
without a chaperone. Other advice: rent a ``sweet'' car, don't
share rooms with teen-agers because vacation for them means not
being neat and finally, don't insist on little adults, be a big kid
instead.

   PRACTICAL-TRAVELER (Undated) How young is too young for a child
to fly? It depends on whom you ask. Continental will not accept an

A DUTCH MOMENT OF GENIUS IN ITS FULL GLORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Japan, the Netherlands)   (For release Sunday, July 23)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM, the Netherlands _ A tiny country that over a short
period produces artists of the stature of Rembrandt, Vermeer, Frans
Hals, Jan Steen, Jacob van Ruisdael and Pieter de Hooch has good
reason to wax proud over its golden age of painting. Indeed, the
Netherlands is doing so yet again with ``The Glory of the Golden
Age,'' a ``best of'' exhibition of Dutch 17th-century art that is
being held at the Rijksmuseum here through Sept. 17 to celebrate
the museum's 200th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   The Rijksmuseum is itself, of course, a monument to the golden
age and, as such, has been able to provide around half of the items
in the show (with Rembrandt's ``Night Watch'' the pivotal work in
the exhibition, just as it is the iconic painting of the permanent
collection). For this occasion, to complement its own masterpieces,
it has also borrowed essential works from other Dutch museums as
well as from collections elsewhere in Europe and in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   In the main part of the exhibition, some 200 paintings,
sculptures and works of decorative art have been organized both
chronologically and around themes, some obvious (``Sky and Water,''
``Masters of Landscape,'' ``The Delft Light''), others more quirky
(``Whims and Drolleries,'' ``Extravagantly Decked Out,''
``Deceptively Realistic'').
</P>
<P>
   Until July 16, 96 drawings and prints were also presented in a
dimly lighted gallery on a lower floor, but their fragility
prevented their being displayed through September.
</P>
<P>
   The package is impressive: with such raw material, how could it
be otherwise? But the show's organizers have also done their bit.
By placing sculptures and decorative arts in the same area as
paintings, they underline how different art forms were flourishing
simultaneously. With the thematic hanging, they demonstrate how
many different schools of paintings were busy at the same time,
from portraiture to landscapes, from still life to genre painting.
</P>
<P>
   Yet perhaps most crucially, the show offers a salutary reminder
that, for all the renown of Rembrandt, Vermeer and their like
today, it was not artists who created the golden age. Rather, it
was a special moment in Dutch history, characterized by political
enlightenment and economic prosperity, that generated a veritable
boom in artistic creation.
</P>
<P>
   In other parts of Europe, art was still reflecting the power of
kings and popes. In the Netherlands, it mirrored the emergence of a
new kind of civil society, one largely run by and for its
Protestant mercantile burghers.
</P>
<P>
   Even more remarkably, for more than 30 years until the Treaty of
Westphalia in 1648, the Dutch Republic, as the United Provinces of
the north became known, was fighting to consolidate its
independence from Spain, which had inherited the Netherlands from
the Holy Roman Empire. Yet even during this time, its fleet was
establishing new colonies and opening new trading routes that
turned Amsterdam into an opulent port city: its population jumped
from 50,000 in 1600 to 200,000 in 1650. With prosperity came a
demand for fancier homes and art to put in them.
</P>
<P>
   Amsterdam, which drew Rembrandt from his native Leiden, was at
the center of artistic activity, but it was not alone. Haarlem,
Utrecht, Delft and Dordrecht, as well as Leiden, had important
guilds of artists, in many cases working independently of one
another. For example, in Utrecht, which remained largely Roman
Catholic, a tradition of religious paintings was kept alive by
painters who had studied Caravaggio in Rome. Elsewhere, paintings
were everywhere except churches _ in town halls, guild houses and
private homes.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, relieved of the need to paint royal portraits and biblical
scenes, many artists became unconscious chroniclers of the social
history of the era. Important burghers, with their black satin
suits and frilly lace collars, were natural subjects, but so also
were maritime battles and elegant cityscapes. Domestic interiors,
in which the nouveaux riches took special pride, were presented
with revolutionary realism, with the paintings on their walls duly
reproduced. Indeed, with still lifes decorating every
self-respecting home, it was an enviable time and place to be an
artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thousands of painters of varying talents were active during
this century, producing several million paintings altogether,'' Jan
Piet Filedt Kok writes in an introduction to this exhibition's
catalog. ``The production of decorative art _ ceramics, glass,
silver and furniture _ achieved new heights, too; only sculpture
lagged behind at first.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Glory of the Golden Age'' starts by introducing the ``New
Faces'' of Dutch portraiture through Thomas de Keyser's ``Syndics
of the Amsterdam Goldsmiths' Guild'' (on loan from the Toledo
Museum of Art in Ohio) and Hals' bucolic ``Marriage Portrait of
Isaac Massa and Beatrix van der Laen.'' This leads to the
``Extravagantly Decked Out'' section, where carefully painted
accessories, from leather gloves with gold thread, pearls and
sequins to delicate lace headwear, are both examples and symbols of
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deceptively Realistic'' is of course dedicated to still lifes,
with Ambrosius Bosschaert's ``Bouquet of Flowers in a Vase'' of
1618 reminiscent of the tulipomania that gripped the Netherlands in
the early 17th century (until the speculative bubble burst in
1637).
</P>
<P>
   But the fascination with still lifes went far beyond flower
arrangements: with just a handful of works, the exhibition
illustrates the virtuosity of painters who took special pride in
portraying, say, cheese or fish or feathers or oysters, in each
case as a realistically as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seemingly Everyday'' is particularly interesting since it
mirrors the ambivalence that the Protestant Dutch felt about their
own affluence (``The Embarrassment of Riches,'' as Simon Schama
entitled his acclaimed book on the Dutch golden age). Painters
evidently enjoyed showing people having a good time, but they
justified this by suggesting they were warning of the perils of
decadence. ``In Luxury Beware'' by Jan Steen, for instance, shows a
party in full swing, while the bare-breasted women and drunken men
in Nicolaus Knupfer's ``Brothel Scene'' could be portrayed in the
Calvinist Netherlands only as an admonition against immorality.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent sections _ there are 23 _ underscore how, at the same
time as they kept one eye on the market, Dutch painters of the
period were also interested in exploring new techniques. For
instance, chiaroscuro _ the strong use of light and shadow _ was
initially borrowed from Caravaggio, but the Delft painters took it
further, creating a more natural sense of drama. Vermeer's mastery
of this technique can be seen here in ``The Glass of Wine,'' on
loan from the Gemaldegalerie in Berlin, and in the Rijksmuseum's
own ``Kitchen Maid.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the array of treasures proffered by the golden age,
the exhibition cannot escape the dominating presence of Rembrandt
and Hals. Three Rembrandts on loan to the Rijksmuseum _ ``The
Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicholas Tulp'' from the Mauritshuis in The
Hague, ``Flora'' from the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg and
``The Wedding of Samson'' from the Gemaldegalerie in Dresden _ show
the broad range of his techniques. Similarly, in the section called
``Militia Companies,'' paintings of citizens' military units by
other artists point up the remarkable composition of Rembrandt's
``Night Watch.'' (MORE)  &QL;

AMSTERDAM, the Netherlands: ``Night Watch.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The section dedicated to Rembrandt and Hals includes numerous
portraits by both men, but their styles can best be contrasted in
two large oils that hang side by side: Rembrandt's 1662
``Syndics,'' owned by the Rijksmuseum, and Hals' 1664 ``Regents of
the Old Men's Almshouse in Haarlem,'' on loan from the Frans
Halsmuseum in Haarlem. While Rembrandt's painting of five burghers
and a servant from the drapers' guild offers six detailed and
well-lighted portraits, Hals' seven regents _ dressed in black
against a black background, with only their faces, hands and white
collars immediately visible _ reveal how he achieved his effect
with a few hurried brush strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered throughout the exhibition are stone and marble
sculptures (mainly busts of worthy burghers), embroidered chairs,
wooden cabinets, glass and silver goblets and a good selection of
Delft pottery.
</P>
<P>
   Most unusual, perhaps, is an 11-foot-tall copper candelabrum
made by Joost Gerritsz in 1640 and donated that same year by the
Dutch East India Co. to Japan's shogun as part of a successful
campaign to curry favor with the Japanese ruler: from 1641 until
early in the 19th century, the Dutch enjoyed a European monopoly of
trade with Japan. The candelabrum, now permanently on display in a
complex of tombs and temples at Nikko in Japan, returned to the
Netherlands for the first time for this show.

   BRITAIN: CHARLES DENIES WEDDING PLAN

   Prince Charles has formally denied that he intends to marry his
longtime mistress, Camilla Parker-Bowles. His office lodged a
complaint with the Press Complaints Commission over a Sunday Times
of London article that said the couple was exploring marrying in
Scotland, where the church is more open to remarriage of those who
have been divorced. ``By making this complaint, we hope it will
formally lay down, on St. James' Palace-headed notepaper, that
there is to be no wedding,'' a court official told the paper.

   Crime figures for England and Wales rose 3.8 percent, with
robberies up 26.1 percent and violent crimes rising by 12.6

alcohol was a key contributing factor in the higher number of

   Gordon Brown, the treasury head, announced a $65 billion
three-year spending package for schools, transportation, the police

di Savoia, 28, grandson of Italy's last king, has been lobbying to

AN ADVENTURER WHO OPERATES OUTSIDE THE BOUNDARIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 23)  
 By DAVE KEHR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Prolific and unpredictable, Patrice Leconte is an
anomalous figure in today's French cinema.
</P>
<P>
   His films _ including the deliriously romantic ``The
Hairdresser's Husband'' (1990), the droll historical drama
``Ridicule,'' which was nominated for an Oscar in 1997, and ``The
Girl on the Bridge,'' a poetic love story with Daniel Auteuil and
Vanessa Paradis that opens on Friday in New York _ belong neither
to the grossly commercial film industry nor to the French tradition
of ``auteur'' filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   Leconte has somehow managed to transcend those narrow
categories, creating movies that have both broad, popular appeal
and a distinctive personal signature, much like the great Hollywood
filmmakers of the studio era.
</P>
<P>
   Like those studio filmmakers, he seems to be in almost constant
motion. He has averaged one feature a year since his debut in 1975,
and in the time it has taken for ``The Girl on the Bridge'' to
reach the United States, he has completed one feature _ the period
piece ``The Widow of Saint-Pierre,'' with Juliette Binoche and
Daniel Auteuil _ and is well into the filming of another, ``Felix
et Lola,'' with Charlotte Gainsbourg and Philippe Torreton. In his
spare time, he makes television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``After `The Widow of Saint-Pierre,' I said to myself, I've
worked a lot, I've worked well, and I want to stop a little. I want
to breathe, to rest, to look at the clouds, to travel, I don't know
what. I want to take a year or two, just to dream. And all of my
friends and my family said, `He'll never stop.' I said, `You'll
see.' Then I realized that even when a film is exhausting, when it
weighs very heavily on your shoulders, you can still recover in a
week or two. And I realized above all that what I liked most in the
world was making movies. So I said, forget what I said. It's stupid
to stop doing what you love to do.''
</P>
<P>
   A small, wiry man with close-cropped hair and large eyes framed
by large, rose-tinted glasses, Leconte spoke on a recent Saturday
morning in his office, a sun-filled former painter's studio here on
the Boulevard du Montparnasse.
</P>
<P>
   ``My origins are very simple,'' he said. ``I'm not Parisian. I
lived in Provence. My father had nothing to do with the movies. He
was a doctor. But he was a cinephile. Without doing it on purpose,
he gave me his passion. I used his amateur camera to make little
things in eight-millimeter. One fine day I said to my parents, I
want to make movies. So in 1967 I went up to Paris and took film
courses at what was then the national film school,'' IDHEC.
</P>
<P>
   After making a number of short films, Leconte graduated to
features with the comic thriller ``The Toilets Were Locked From the
Inside,'' which found him in constant conflict with his more
seasoned star, Jean Rochefort. ``It wasn't a very good film,''
Leconte said, ``and it was a commercial failure. But the second
film, `Les Bronzes,' was a huge hit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Les Bronzes'' (``The Tanned Ones'') represented the film debut
of the members of the Splendid troupe, an improvisational cafe
theater that was then the rage of Paris. The group included Michel
Blanc, Thierry Lhermitte, Gerard Jugnot, Christian Clavier and
Josiane Balasko _ all of whom have gone on to become stars in
France.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their story is amazing,'' Leconte said. ``They had all been in
the same high school class, the same students in the same
classroom. You realize? Afterward, they stayed together, they did
the Splendid, and now they're all stars. In the same class, at 15
years old, there was Lhermitte, Clavier, Jugnot, Blanc _ it's
unimaginable. I'll bet their teachers remember.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Les Bronzes,'' based on a play the troupe had created,
satirized a collection of average Frenchmen on vacation in a Club
Med-style resort. Drawing on a sketch-style humor, it launched a
new trend in French comedy, much as ``Saturday Night Live'' had in
the United States, and generated a series of sequels (``Les Bronzes
Go Skiing,'' 1979) and follow-ups (``Come to My Place, I Live at my
Girlfriend's,'' 1980; ``Keep Moving, There's Nothing to See,''
1982) that established Leconte as the foremost director of comedy
in France.
</P>
<P>
   But he was restless. With ``The Specialists'' (1984), he tried a
caper film; with ``Tandem'' (1986), a more naturalistic,
sentimental comedy. But no one was prepared for ``Monsieur Hire''
when it had its premiere at the 1988 Cannes International Film
Festival. A moody, perverse, passionate film about a mousy tailor (
Blanc) who spies on his beautiful neighbor (Sandrine Bonnaire), the
film was just as surprising as if John Belushi had suddenly (and
successfully) taken up Dostoyevsky.
</P>
<P>
   ```Tandem' changed a lot of things for me,'' Leconte said. ``But
`Monsieur Hire' was, no doubt, the first real evident change in
register, in style. When I made it, people asked me constantly if
I'd changed _ what had changed in me to make something so
different. But actually nothing had changed. This is the best
comparison: you like the movies, you go often to the movies, but
when you go, sometimes you see comedies, sometimes you see dramas
or adventures _ you go to see everything, if you like the movies.
And so, if when you're a spectator, you like a lot of different
things, why can't you, as a director, make a lot of different
things? It's all cinema.''
</P>
<P>
   From ``Monsieur Hire'' on, Leconte developed an adventurous,
highly emotional style that broke many of the fundamental rules of
the commercial cinema while continuing to function within it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monsieur Hire'' and ``The Hairdresser's Husband'' both take
place in dreamlike worlds that seem to exist outside any particular
time or locale; ``Ridicule'' bends the rules of the period film by
introducing subtly disorienting, anachronistic touches; ``The Girl
on the Bridge'' combines old-fashioned, classically lighted
black-and-white images with a freedom of camera movement that
shatters any sense of nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the protagonists of ``Girl'' _ Auteuil plays a
professional knife thrower and Paradis is the girl he saves from
suicide to become his professional target _ can chat casually with
each other across time and space, so do Leconte's films push to
transcend specific epochs and physical settings. Like the American
master Frank Borzage (``Seventh Heaven,'' 1927), Leconte believes
in the power of emotion to rise above the petty limitations of
reality. For him, love knows no boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``What pleased me a lot about `The Girl on the Bridge' was that
it was a love story but that it was above all a story of desire,''
he said. ``The two characters feel that, above their heads,
something very strong is hovering, and a spark would be enough to
get them to fall in each other's arms. But this spark only comes at
the very end. The challenge is to build that desire for an hour and
a half, until at the end it finally happens.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All films are love stories,'' said Leconte, and it is true
that a powerful, almost swooning sense of romantic redemption runs
through his best films. But he remains capable of following a
romance like ``The Hairdresser's Husband'' with a black comedy like
``Tango'' (1992), or ``Ridicule'' with a big-star romp like ``One
Chance Out of Two'' (1998) starring Alain Delon and Jean-Paul
Belmondo (which was not released in the United States).
</P>
<P>
   For Leconte, changing registers is ``the only solution for me to
stay alive, not to go to sleep, to frighten myself, to put myself
in question, to never take the same road twice.'' He continued: ``I
want to astonish myself. I want to do things that I don't know how
to do. If you make the same film all your life, if you take the
same route movie after movie, you're more likely to go around in
circles. Me, when I go in one direction, then in another, then in
another, I tell myself, well, I have less risk of repeating myself.
The only cure for facileness is to be completely new each time. It
works for me. (MORE)  &QL; 
 &QL; 
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something in France that has done a lot of harm to the
cinema, the notion of the `cinema d'auteur.' You in the U.S. have a
great advantage over us, because there the notion of auteur cinema
doesn't really exist. There are writers and there are directors,
and they aren't necessarily the same person. In France, if you make
a film you haven't written, you don't get much respect. But I've
always thought there aren't just directors who can write great
stories _ there are screenwriters for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Writers aren't paid very well in France, and that's a problem.
When I made `Ridicule,' it was a script that was proposed to me. I
loved it, and I said, `We'll shoot this, we won't change a comma,
it's magnificent.' But before they offered it to me, the producers
had offered it to four other directors, big people, and they all
said, `No thanks, I only shoot what I write.' And they said no to a
very good script. It's idiotic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The author is also the director, of course. If you give a good
script to three different directors, you'll have three different
films. It's the director plus the writer plus the actor plus the
producer _ it takes the whole thing, you have to be many, you have
to be surrounded by people with lots of talent and you have to have
a little bit yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``For `The Girl on the Bridge,' I didn't write the script. The
scenarist, Serge Frydman, is a young guy in his '40s who likes
writing scripts. He doesn't want to be a director; he's a
screenwriter. The two of us together, drinking a lot of coffee,
invented the story of `The Girl,' but I never picked up a pen to
write anything. Afterward, I said, `OK, we've talked enough about
it, go write it.' And he wrote it by himself. When you shoot a film
you haven't written, you have a much more objective point of view.
You want to make a movie worthy of the screenplay, and I find that
very motivating.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't aspire to be good at everything,'' Leconte concluded.
``But I do aspire to stay awake.'' &QL;

AETNA SAYS HEALTH CARE COSTS WILL CAUSE IT TO MISS EARNINGS
FORECASTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MILT FREUDENHEIM     
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aetna Inc., the nation's biggest health insurance company, said
Tuesday that it would not meet second-quarter earnings forecasts
because its health care costs were rising faster than expected.
Surprised investors drove down Aetna's stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said the announcement raised questions about
Aetna's plans to reorganize and sell its nonhealth units to the ING
Group of the Netherlands. Final agreement on the sale of Aetna's
international and financial services units still has not been
reached, people close to the deal said.
</P>
<P>
   Although ING was not directly concerned with the results in
Aetna's main health business, some analysts said the earnings
announcement could give ING a psychological advantage in the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna said its second-quarter earnings would be 85 to 95 cents a
share, well below analysts' estimates of $1.20 a share, according
to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks company earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The company said medical costs in its core commercial health
maintenance organizations rose 10 percent to 12 percent in the
second quarter as members spent more time in hospitals, emergency
rooms, outpatient surgery centers and doctors' offices. It promised
to provide more information on the problems when it reports
quarterly earnings on Aug. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Aetna dropped $9.25, or 13.7 percent, to $57.375
before rebounding to close at $59.6875, down $6.9375. The stock had
declined $4.0625 on Monday after speculation that a sale to ING
would be completed failed to materialize over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ING and Aetna have not commented except to confirm that talks
are under way.
</P>
<P>
   Most health insurance stocks also dropped on the Big Board
Tuesday. Cigna declined $3.4365 to $98.0625. UnitedHealth Group
lost $3.6875 to $83.25. But Wellpoint Health Networks Inc. gained
$2.1875, to $85.0625.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the problems faced by Aetna, based in Hartford,
were unique as it struggles to integrate acquired companies, soften
its aggressive culture and replace several departing senior health
insurance executives.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna has said that it is searching for a new chief executive to
run its health plan business, which it intends to spin off as a
separate company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's really minding the store,'' said Roberta Goodman, a
health care analyst at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   William S. McKeever, an analyst at PaineWebber Securities, said
Aetna faced ``more challenges than anyone else in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Costs were also rising in its money-losing Prudential Health
Care unit and Medicare HMO's. Aetna said recently that it would
close unprofitable Medicare HMO's with 355,000 members in 11 states
next year.
</P>
<P>
   William H. Donaldson, who took over as chief executive in
February, said Aetna was ``very disappointed with this increase''
in costs. He said operations would be tightened to increase
efficiency and fix or exit markets and products that do not meet
financial and strategic goals.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna plans to start raising health care premiums for a minority
of customers whose contracts open for change in the fourth quarter.
Contracts for most big employers started on Jan. 1 and for many
municipalities on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   James A. Lane, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said the
announcement had damaged the confidence that investors had placed
in Donaldson, a former Wall Street banker.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Donaldson had said earlier that annual earnings
would exceed $4.80 a share this year, Lane said his ``credibility
is now defunct, at least for the short term.'' Lane lowered his own
2000 earnings estimate to $3.75 a share from $4.95.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert A. Denton, an investment manager who is president of
Providence Capital Inc., said the earnings report was ``a huge pie
in the face to investors.'' He said that ``in retrospect, Aetna
might have been well advised to conclude a deal in June, ahead of
the earnings report.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives ING and other would-be acquirers of Aetna's financial
services a psychological edge,'' Denton said.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman at Merrill Lynch said Aetna had reported in a Securities
and Exchange Commission filing that it had underestimated its costs
in the second half of 1999, which may have led to misjudgments
about this year's costs. HMO's typically project costs and set
their rates for the year during the preceding summer. But the
companies do not begin to learn their actual costs until the next
June or July.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the costs might have swelled after Donaldson made
clear he wanted to improve relations with doctors, hospitals,
patients and consumers, who want flexibility to decide on their
care. Like other health insurers, Aetna faces a host of lawsuits
filed by plaintiff's lawyers who hope to bring class actions on
behalf of patients and doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna had angered doctors by forcing them to choose between
accepting low-paying, tightly controlled HMO patients or giving up
all Aetna patients.
</P>
<P>
   But Joyce Oberdorf, a spokeswoman for Aetna, said that the
operating changes intended to placate doctors that Donaldson had
announced in Texas, Connecticut and Virginia were not reflected in
the second-quarter earnings. They did not begin until this month.
</P>
<P>
   She added that the company's intention was to eliminate policies
that ``may be perceived as obstacles or may create hassles'' with
providers of health care ``and do not add to Aetna's ability to
monitor quality of care and control costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Lane at Salomon said the problems with earnings could complicate
negotiations to sell the financial and international units. ``The
company could have a hard time obtaining lender and creditor
approval for debt restructuring necessary to consummate significant
divestitures in light of the operational trends in its largest
health business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the ING-Aetna negotiations have said that Aetna
is seeking to transfer $2.75 billion of long-term debt to ING as
part of a $7.75 billion deal for the nonhealth units.

MIKAILA AIMS TO BREAK THE BLOND TEEN POP-STAR MOLD 
 (ACCOMPANIES POPMUSIC-FERMAN-COLUMN)
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
 By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jeff Fenster knows talent _ or at least a dollar sign _ when he
sees it.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based talent scout and executive vice president of
A&AMP;R (artist and repertoire) for the Island/Def Jam label is the man
responsible for signing teen-pop unstoppables Backstreet Boys and
Britney Spears to Jive Records, where he used to work.
</P>
<P>
   Since he joined Island/Def Jam a year ago, he has signed only
one artist, but he insists she's going to be a big one: Mikaila
Enriquez, a 13-year-old singer from North Richland Hills, Texas, a
Fort Worth suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Island/Def Jam is poising Mikaila _ who, trendily, goes by her
first name only (it's pronounced Mah-KAY-la) _ for major success by
giving her the opening slot on Spears' current tour (which rolls
into Smirnoff Music Centre in Dallas on Wednesday night), sending
her across the country to pop radio stations for interviews and
spending a ton of time, energy and money on her self-titled debut,
which is set to come out January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   It's something she's been preparing for all of her young life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been singing since I was 3, since I could talk,'' Mikaila
said, calling from a hotel room in New York, where she's been
rehearsing for her tour with Britney. ``Wherever, family reunions,
school, church.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, with Britney, stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're gonna do the same thing that we did with Britney,''
Fenster said. ``We're gonna put her out there and keep her out
there. This isn't something you do with every artist, but when it's
someone this special, you kind of want to let the world know that
you're coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Mikaila is the latest in a long line of attractive, post-Britney
teen female singers to be groomed for the pop-music spotlight _ and
the third from Texas, right behind Jessica Simpson from Plano and
Angela Via from San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   What makes her different is her age. At 13, Mikaila is the
youngest pop singer to get a major label deal. But in spite of the
music industry's current Lolita-like love affair with blond teen
girls _ as well as the arrival of Billy Gilman, the much-touted,
12-year-old male country singer _ Fenster surely must fear that
Mikaila's age will handicap her in an industry known for its
cutthroat competition, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the answer is `no,' '' Fenster says. ``It's an old
cliche, but from our standpoint, age ain't nothing but a number.
Besides, she's a teen artist and her initial audience will be
teens. She is a member of who her audience is. That's where they
start, with their peers. If they're the real deal, they grow and
appeal to an even broader audience.''
</P>
<P>
   To Mikaila's credit, she hardly seems like a 13-year-old.
Makeup, platform shoes and sexy clothing at least superficially
bump up her maturity a few years, but it's not just her looks that
belie her age. She is quick-witted and sagacious far beyond her
years.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if she feels like the label is looking to cash in on
the cute-girl trend rather than her talent, she answers astutely.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're always going to be looking at the money side,'' she
says, ``But they haven't forced me to do anything I haven't wanted
to do. That's why I went with them. A lot of new artists get pushed
in directions they don't want to go, or get lost among other
artists on that label. It's sad.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of Edmond, Okla., Mikaila moved to North Texas with her
family when she was 9. There, she attended Spring Garden Elementary
School in Bedford; she had already been singing for six years.
</P>
<P>
   Mikaila's family eventually took her musical aspirations
seriously and helped her build a career, enrolling her in vocal and
dance classes. Singing in churches led to singing at sporting
events. Sporting events led to lawyers' offices. Finally, the
family hired entertainment attorney Larry Rudolph, who just so
happened to be Britney Spears' manager.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Mikaila says, the phone would not stop ringing.
``We went to New York and, in one day, visited five different
record labels,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   After signing with Island/Def Jam, Mikaila began work on her
self-titled debut.
</P>
<P>
   And it will be this album, Mikaila says, that will make her
stand apart from all the other teen singers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My music is a lot different than everyone else's,'' she says.
``It has more of an R&AMP;B flavor to it. It's not the usual thing you
hear on the radio. Plus, I know I'm gonna stand out 'cause I have
brown hair.''

HOT NEW GAMES FOR YOUR PC
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
 By MALCOLM MAYHEW
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the Next Generation video-game war raging among Sega
Dreamcast, Nintendo 64 and Sony PlayStation, the PC often gets
overlooked as an outlet for equally great vid-games. Here's a look
at four of the best new PC titles:
</P>
<P>
   Chicken Run Fun Pack (Activision, all ages): Two games, a screen
saver, a clock, a CD player and clips from the movie _ this thing's
packed with cool stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The first game, ``Run Chicken Run,'' is a direct lift from the
movie: Players must help the chicks escape from the barn before
they wind up Kentucky Fried. Problem is, the farmyard is scattered
with holes in which the chicks can get trapped. Players must find
boards, cover the holes and lead as many winged ones as possible to
safety before time runs out.
</P>
<P>
   The second game, ``Spring Chicken,'' picks up where the first
one left off. Now that the chicks have escaped from the barn,
players must launch them _ via a trampoline _ over a fence to
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Dark Reign 2 (Activision, ages 13 and up): Yes, it's another
run-and-shoot futuristic action game, but it's a good one.
</P>
<P>
   This one's a cut above the rest because players have so many
options: They can play as one of two teams (the rich guys or the
ragtag outfit) or corral a bunch of friends for the dizzying
multiplayer mode.
</P>
<P>
   There doesn't seem to be much of an object here, just blow up
your opponents and capture their areas. It's pleasingly simple in
other ways, too, from the easy-to-learn controls to the
understandable, and exquisitely detailed, playing fields. The
characters look pretty cool, kind of a cross between the guys in
Dune and Blade Runner.
</P>
<P>
   Parents beware: There's a lot of blood and violence, hence the
13 and up rating.
</P>
<P>
   The Settlers III: Ultimate Collection (Blue Byte, all ages): To
hype its upcoming The Settlers IV, Blue Byte has repackaged the
third game in its empire-building/defending/destroying series with
bonus games. The object remains the same, though: Choose an empire,
from Egyptian, Roman and Asian, build it up from scratch, then wipe
out the empires. The bonus CDs include new maps, warriors,
buildings and missions.
</P>
<P>
   Pajama Sam's One-Stop Fun Shop (Humongous Entertainment, ages
3-8): Man, Pajama Sam's got more games than Mario. The latest title
hosted by the green critter is designed to get young ones
interested in art. Using virtual art tools, kids can create and
color their own pictures and storybooks. Best of all, there's no
mess to clean up.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ In Soviet days, filmmakers came to this
graceful city looking for a backdrop for historical dramas with men
in top hats and ladies smothered in furs dashing along snowy
streets in horse-drawn sleighs.
</P>
<P>
   Not any more. In the last two years, St. Petersburg has become
the hottest location for the hottest trend on Russian television:
gritty, tell-it-like-it-is cop shows and their many spinoffs,
coming to Russian screens this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Forget palaces and carriages, balls and picnics. Now the stories
are set in the city's dank courtyards and dingy stairwells,
featuring bloodied corpses, distraught prostitutes and cynical hit
men _ familiar stuff for Russian television viewers who for the
last 10 years have been treated to a steady stream of of contract
killings, war and violence on their nightly news shows.
</P>
<P>
   The boom began in early 1998 with ``The Street of Broken
Streetlights,'' a St. Petersburg version of ``Hill Street Blues,''
starring a group of four likable, slightly goofy cops, earnest
versions of the old ``wild and crazy guys'' on ``Saturday Night
Live.'' Nicknamed ``Menty,'' the Russian slang word for cops, the
show is now about to enter its third season, and its 58th episode.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they are kicking down doors to communal apartments or
careening down the embankments by the city's famous canals in their
boxy little Lada cars, toasting witnesses with a shot of vodka or
joshing with informers on Nevsky Prospekt, the foursome have
bumbled their way to stardom. Fans stop them on the streets in
Siberia and Odessa, and buy videos of the show in Brighton Beach
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in their wake, half a dozen mini-series are being shot or
are on the drawing boards in St. Petersburg, starring
counter-intelligence agents, mafia dons, tough female investigators
and other heroes and villains in Russia's newly recast obsession
with the struggle between good and evil.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big mistake for these past years to think that people
don't heed heroes, when heroes are a natural part of the human
story,'' said Ada Staviskaya, whose Panaroma studio is producing
two new heroines for television. In ``Secrets of the
Investigation,'' the star is a deputy prosecutor and a ``seeker of
truth,'' to quote the press release for the season's new shows,
while ``Hunt for Cinderella'' stars a mysterious and ultimately
beautiful woman who undergoes plastic surgery, suffers from amnesia
and emerges as a Russian version of ``La Femme Nikita.''
</P>
<P>
   Also coming up is a second season of ``Agent of National
Security,'' offering ``a no-nonsense street-smart guy'' and ``a
seeker of justice in an unjust world.'' With two more series in the
development stages (including ``Baron,'' portraying a prodigy
Jewish violinist who later presents himself as a local Gypsy king),
Media-MOST, Russia's largest private media company, which owns both
the TNT network and NTV, a national channel, has taken the lead in
the Petersburg mini-series boom, although ORT, its arch-rival,
weighed in last winter with its own Petersburg action series,
``Killing Power.''
</P>
<P>
   One exception to the contemporary motif is ``Empire,'' a 12-part
series due to be broadcast in October on ORT, which takes a step
back in time and re-enacts _ again in St. Petersburg _ a string of
history-making ``hits'' or terrorist attacks that took place during
the final decades of the Romanov empire.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of St. Petersburg as a venue has an echo in real
life. In recent years, the city has become known as Russia's crime
capital, made infamous by a string of contract killings, including
the shooting death, in the winter of 1998, of Galina Starovoitova,
a leading reform democrat, and two murders, in broad daylight on
Nevsky Prospekt, of top-ranking city officials, one by a sniper's
bullet and the other by a bomb neatly placed on a car roof.
</P>
<P>
   Local police and politicians hotly dispute this reputation,
noting _ accurately _ that Moscow and its surrounding region are at
the top of national crime charts. But perceptions linger, and the
spate of TV shows have only further enhanced the cloud over the
city's image.
</P>
<P>
   For Mikhail Piotrovsky, the director of the Hermitage State
Museum, the last straw was a show earlier this year with the
unnuanced title of ``Bandit Petersburg,'' which even featured
skulduggery at Russia's most venerable museum. ``Of course, when
every day the words `Bandit Petersburg' are flashed on the screen,
it is not going to please anyone in Petersburg,'' he said during a
TV interview. ``And when they drag in the Hermitage, then they are
really going too far.''
</P>
<P>
   The interviewer, after thanking Piotrovsky for appearing on her
prime-time show, couldn't help but note that ``Bandit Petersburg''
was coming up next.
</P>
<P>
   Like many trend-setting programs, ``Broken Streetlights'' _ the
brainchild of Sergei Skvartsov, now general director of the TV
division of Media-MOST _ took a long time reaching the screen. Its
success, when it finally went on the air, was its appeal to a
market that, after years of splurging on imported goods, had
developed a craving for local, down-home fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``When American films burst onto Russian screens in the early
1990's, Russian viewers soon found that the American way of life
was something very, very far away from their own,'' said Aleksandr
Kapitsa, the veteran producer of ``Broken Streetlights.'' ``But our
guys are familiar, they are the guy next door, your neighbor on the
trolley bus, your brother, your son. They are charming and they are
recognizable, with no pretensions, just trying to do their jobs in
bad conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The conditions are familiar. Shot entirely on location, the
series uses the back building of a police station on Vasily Island
as its own ``headquarters,'' where it can shoot only on weekends,
when the real cops in the Lost and Stolen Documents Division have
their days off. The authenticity is unmistakable, from the broken
windowpanes to the dusty piles of documents, the naked lightbulbs
and the chipped concrete.
</P>
<P>
   This shabbiness is part of the charm people associate with
``Peter,'' the Russian nickname for the former imperial capital,
which, in contrast to the flash and bustle of Moscow, has preserved
not only its czarist-era beauty but also the slow pace and
grunginess of its recent Soviet past.
</P>
<P>
   ``One man called from Israel,'' said Aleksei Nilov, a
36-year-old actor who plays one of the four main roles. ``He was
all emotional and said he watches the show with great nostalgia
because, he said, it captures the Petersburg where he was born and
brought up.''
</P>
<P>
   Where there are heroes, there are also myths. For all the
realism of ``Menty,'' there is also an element of make-believe in
the slightly rosy, good-humored picture of the life and times of a
big-city Russian police station.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cinema is the creator of myths,'' said Dmitri Svetozarov,
director of the ``Agent'' series. ``There were myths about the
Soviet policeman. And now there are these myths about the
contemporary policemen, showing them drinking vodka, dozing on the
job, all of which helps the viewers see themselves in these
characters. These myths may not be true either, but at least it is
a new myth.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, most Russian police officers are apt to be a bit more
bribable, and less successful at tracking down their prey, than
their TV counterparts. ``This is the police our viewers wish they
had but don't,'' admitted Kapitsa. ``And the police like it because
it makes them look good.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Petersburg's quiet streets and picturesque backdrops are one
reason this city is becoming, as some here now call it, Hollywood
on the Neva. ``The city itself is made for filming,'' explained
Nikolai Suslov, producer of ``Empire'' and before that the
technical producer of ``Killing Power.''
</P>
<P>
   But another motive is more prosaic. Although St. Petersburg is
Russia's second-largest city, it is significantly cheaper than
Moscow. According to Suslov, expenses here are, on the average, 20
to 40 percent less than in the capital and actors' wages _ which,
on average, equal $200 a day _ are literally half the going Moscow
rate.
</P>
<P>
   For St. Petersburg's hard-pressed theater world, the arrival of
the mini-series has proved to be a lifeline at a time when Russian
cinema is still languishing. ``I keep saying that these series play
a humanitarian role in St. Petersburg,'' said Svetozarov. ``We are
returning to viewers those actors who had disappeared from the big
screen. We are restoring those old contacts.''  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The birth of the series has also restored some life to the vast
inner-city studios at Lenfilm, once one of the powerhouses of
Soviet cinema and now a mournful shell of dilapidated buildings and
junked-up courtyards.
</P>
<P>
   But the industry here has a way to go before it reaches
Hollywood standards. Lacking equipment for synchronized sounds,
actors have to return to the studio to dub in their voices, and
scriptwriters are in a constant scramble to keep up with the pace
of production.
</P>
<P>
   All this is a particular strain for producers and directors
brought up in the Soviet school, when filmmaking was a leisurely,
labor-intensive process. Now filming that used to take months is
packed into a single week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still don't have the kind of industry they have in
America,'' Kapitsa said. ``But for the money that any American
director would think of as low budget, we can shoot something that
is very decent.'' &QL;

 &HT;    With stock plunging, Office Depot replaces chief executive
officer
 &HT;    By Paul Owers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DELRAY BEACH, Fla. - With its stock price plummeting and
shareholder dissension soaring, Office Depot on Tuesday replaced
Chief Executive David Fuente with Bruce Nelson, the company's
international president.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson conceded the investment community has lost confidence in
the Delray Beach-based office supply giant and promised to take a
new look at all aspects of the business. Fuente will stay on as a
non-executive chairman of the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a candid guy, and the candid truth is that we've made some
mistakes,'' Nelson said. ``We have to fix them.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson questioned the company's recent decisions to enter
markets already dominated by competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the rest of the U.S. (stores) were doing as well as South
Florida, the company would be doing a lot better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Office Depot operates 855 stores in the United States and
Canada. It employs about 2,600 people at its Delray Beach
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson's appointment did nothing to hurt the company's stock
price. Office Depot shares (NYSE: ODP) closed Tuesday at $6.63, up
25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, 55, came to Office Depot when the company bought Viking
Office Products in 1998. The Utah native also was president and CEO
of Chicago-based BT Office Products USA and had more than 20 years
of senior management experience at Boise Cascade Office Products in
Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bruce brings a combination of strong leadership skills, solid
operating know-how, financial acumen and expertise in international
operations _ one of our key growth engines going forward,'' James
L. Heskett, chairman of Office Depot's Governance Committee, said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Fuente, 54, turned Office Depot into the largest U.S. retailer
of office supplies in his 13 years as CEO. Before that, the Chicago
native was president of the $1 billion-a-year Sherwin-Williams
Paint Stores.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, rival Staples announced plans to buy Office Depot in a
$3.4 billion stock deal before the Federal Trade Commission called
it off a year later. In July 1997, Fuente led a raucous party in
which relieved Office Depot employees threw away anything related
to the collapsed Staples deal.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's recent performance wasn't worthy of a
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Office Depot's sales have lagged, and the company announced last
week that its second-quarter profit fell by 20 percent.
Additionally, it said earnings for the year ending Dec. 31 could be
as much as 13 cents below analyst expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Office Depot shares have traded recently near its 52-week low of
$6 since trading in the mid-$20s early last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company today faces new challenges, and we agreed with
David that it was appropriate for him to take a more advisory
role,'' Heskett said.
</P>
<P>
   Fuente was not available for comment Tuesday. A source said
Fuente thought he would have been given more time to turn around
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson earned $630,000 in base salary last year as chief
executive of Office Depot's Viking unit. Fuente's salary was $1
million, and he ranked fourth this year on a Bloomberg News list of
most overpaid and underperforming CEOs.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the company's move to change leadership looks
promising.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a good start,'' said Dan Binder, an analyst
with Buckingham Research Group in New York. ``In terms of a
restructuring the company, you have to start at the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Binder said Office Depot's slide is mostly attributable to
slumping sales in its retail stores. He expects the company to grow
more slowly and possibly close even more stores than the 27
announced last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nelson is an industry veteran and well-respected, and he'll be
extremely focused on fixing the problems,'' Binder said. ``I think
he'll be deliberate and analytical in his approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said Office Depot has enjoyed impressive growth in its
Internet and international businesses and intends to revitalize its
retail stores with a better product mix, customer service and
marketing. The company will continue to expand internationally
while cutting costs to lure back customers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson also expects to hire several senior-level managers,
including a marketing director. He did not rule out the possibility
of layoffs, but indicated that eliminating a large number of
positions was unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to take a look at everything we do and see if
there is a better, more efficient way to do it,'' Nelson said.

THE OLD COURSE AT ST. ANDREWS ALWAYS PRESENTS A NEW CHALLENGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ They call it the Old Course, yet every
round offers something new.
</P>
<P>
   Few golf courses in the world change from day to day, or even
hour to hour, like the Old Course at St. Andrews. When the weather
is calm, birdies beckon. When the weather is blustery, it becomes a
beast.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what happens in this year's British Open, which begins
Thursday, will be determined by the unpredictable weather,
especially the wind. If the weather is benign, the winning score
could be lower than Nick Faldo's 270 (18 under par) in 1990, the
lowest Open score at St. Andrews. But if the wind whips for three
or four days, expect a winning score around 282 (six under par),
the score John Daly won with in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The layout of St. Andrews is unique, featuring many distinctive
characteristics _ deep pot bunkers, enormous double greens, wide
and fast fairways and blind tee shots. With so many variables,
nobody is sure what to expect. That is part of what makes St.
Andrews intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I play it, I learn something new about the golf
course,'' said Tiger Woods after Tuesday's practice round. ``That
is one of the great things about this course _ so many things to
learn, different wind conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even for a British Open, this is different. It's so much
faster. It's weird to have the fairways faster than the greens.
It's different to what we're used to in the States, different than
we're used to seeing in British Opens. It's going to be a wonderful
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   It will take shot-making and sound strategy to win, but long
hitters like Woods enter the tournament with a huge advantage, at
least on paper. In calm conditions, long hitters can fly the ball
over many of the notorious, deep-faced bunkers that are part of St.
Andrews' character. Anyone who spends significant time in the sand
this week will not win. Spending time in a deep bunker at St.
Andrews can be like spending time in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you hit it firm into the bunkers, you will be in there
forever if you're not careful,'' Vijay Singh said. ``If you hit in
the wrong place, it is impossible to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Expect to see some players hit sideways out of some bunkers, or
even backward away from the hole, if that is the easiest way to get
out. Nobody wants to duplicate Tommy Nakajima in 1978, who needed
five shots to escape the Road Hole bunker at No. 17, one of the
most difficult holes in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding the bunkers is not easy, because many of them cannot be
seen from the tee boxes. Meanwhile, with the fairways so fast this
year, coupled with the slopes in the fairways, a good shot can
quickly become a bad shot if it lands on grass and rolls into sand.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this place, you have a premium on driving the golf ball,''
David Duval said. ``The penalty is not knee-high rough. It's pot
bunkers. You really need to be conscious of the line you choose off
tees, because you can't see those bunkers.''
</P>
<P>
   Putting is important at any major, but the greens at St. Andrews
are large and undulating. When some of the pins are tucked into
dangerous positions, players will be forced to hit safe approach
shots, leaving them 50 to 60 feet away from the cup.
</P>
<P>
   Lag putting will be very important this week. Those who can
consistently two-putt from long range will save themselves strokes.
Because the conditions are so fast, many players will putt from
well off the green, rather than risk a chip shot that could roll
far beyond the pin.
</P>
<P>
   But the wind will dictate much of the strategy. The wind at St.
Andrews can change strength and direction without warning, making
club selection extremely difficult. With a strong wind, a player
with Woods' power can drive the ball 400 yards.
</P>
<P>
   St. Andrews has been lengthened almost 200 yards to 7,115 yards
since it last played host to the Open in 1995. But seven of the par
4 holes measure less than 400 yards, and if the wind is at their
backs, expect many players to go for the greens off the tee.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the par 5 holes, No. 5 (568 yards) and No. 14 (581
yards) are reachable in two shots, and the final hole, the 357-yard
No. 18, can be reached with a drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit a couple of drives 360, 380 yards,'' Faldo said. ``So
Tiger will be hitting them 450. He can drive six of the greens, and
he reaches the fifth hole with a driver and a wedge. He's the man
to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   But many top players are performing well heading into the
tournament, like Ernie Els, who won in Loch Lomond, Scotland, on
Saturday, and Lee Westwood, who has won three of his last six
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Not every player likes St. Andrews, but every player respects
its history. This weekend, one player will become a part of that
history, winning the 2000 British Open on a course that should
present a different challenge every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never played particularly well here, so that's probably
why I haven't enjoyed it much,'' Westwood said. ``But it's growing
on me. It's a good test of golf. I am going to learn to like it
this week.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than three months, Kevin Meeker, owner of Philadelphia
Fish and Co., a restaurant and bar, put up with a cook whose
obsession with the stock market often took his mind away from the
soup. The 22-year-old employee checked his Motorola shares every
half-hour on his pager and periodically slipped out to the dining
room to get the bartender to turn on CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, Meeker says, he would have warned the cook to
knock it off and fired him if he did not comply. But not in this
job market. Instead, he turned a blind eye to the goofing off and
says he would probably still have the man on the payroll if he had
not quit on Mother's Day after being asked to work beyond his
eight-hour shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the attitude among workers right now is, `I could
always go and get another job,''' Meeker said. ``Now, that cook's
working for another restaurant around the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Checking on stock prices is the least of it. Increasingly,
employees are testing the boundaries of the American work ethic as
employers, hammered by the cost of recruiting and training and
fearful that they will be unable to fill job openings, make
allowances for just about every form of misconduct. Offenses like
frequent tardiness or absenteeism, apathy and even insubordination
that would have merited a pink slip a few years ago are now being
shrugged off as inconveniences.
</P>
<P>
   The new management rule, it seems, is that a warm body is better
than no body.
</P>
<P>
   Take Suzan Windnagel, director of human resources for a credit
union in San Jose, Calif. A woman who worked for her was frequently
late, gave customers incorrect information and just did not feel
like learning new computer skills.
</P>
<P>
   If not for the tight labor market, Windnagel says, she would
have dismissed the woman within four months. Instead, she spent a
year and a half counseling her, lecturing her and trying to train
her. Nothing worked, and, finally, she had to let her go.
</P>
<P>
   But she says she is neither surprised nor particularly upset
about the sloppy work habits she sees around her these days.
``Workers, not bosses, have the upper hand,'' said Windnagel, who
has been a human resources manager for 22 years. ``Managers today
know how hard it is to recruit people, so they put up with more. I
don't blame workers at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people still put in an honest day's work, of course. It is
just that the lazy, the rude and the nonproductive have an an
easier time of it.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Peterson, vice president for human resources at the Shape
Corp., an automotive supplier in Grand Haven, Mich., for example,
says most of the company's 1,000 workers are productive and
disciplined. Yet Peterson acknowledges that he harbors
under-performers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have we held on to people where in years past, we would have
fired them?'' Peterson said. ``The answer is yes.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the leniency is that at any given time, the
company has an average of 40 unfilled jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Because skilled-trade positions are so tough to fill, Peterson
said, he tolerated for nearly a year a hot-tempered electrician who
often threatened co-workers. The company tried to counsel him and
even signed him up for anger-management training, but finally
dismissed him. ``Five or six years ago, we would have not put up
with that,'' Peterson said. ``The person would have been gone
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   To combat worsening tardiness and absenteeism, he said, Shape
has chosen the carrot over the stick. Last year, it decided to give
workers 17 hours of personal time off a year on top of their
vacation days _ and to pay them $10 for each of those hours they do
not use. ``We're giving incentives for people to be at work,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Adaptec Inc., a maker of software and computer components in
Milpitas, Calif., illustrates the starkness of the change taking
place in the workplace. Six years ago, almost one-third of the
people who left the company had been fired, according to Rick
Olivieri, the director of compensation and benefits. Today, that
proportion is down to 2 percent. ``It's a real war for people out
there right now,'' Olivieri said.
</P>
<P>
   But leniency carries risks, warns DeAnne Rosenberg, author of
``Hiring the Best Person for Every Job'' (John Wiley &AMP; Sons, 2000).
Most notably, accommodating shirkers can hurt office morale, she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg cites the case of a home-health-care administrator in
Boston who yelled constantly at her co-workers, fobbed off work on
colleagues and treated clients disrespectfully. Over eight months,
10 co-workers complained to her supervisor, but he refused to
reprimand her, much less fire her. ``He kept saying: `It's a hard
labor market. At least the little she does, she does,''' Rosenberg
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the co-workers took matters into their own hands.
They came in on a weekend, packed up the administrator's belongings
and moved her desk and chair to another floor, she said. When the
administrator came to work on Monday, they pretended she was not
there and talked about her as if she had gone to another company.
</P>
<P>
   She quit that day.
</P>
<P>
   Obnoxious behavior is one thing. Illegal behavior is another.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Spring, a labor and employment lawyer in Sacramento,
Calif., says that executives at one of his client companies, a
national book and music chain, merely gave a written warning to a
manager who had ordered two subordinates to move a marijuana plant
from his office to his home during work hours, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, a bank slapped the wrist of an employee who had
been caught downloading pornography from the Internet, revoking his
Internet privileges for 30 days and sending him to a
sensitivity-training course.
</P>
<P>
   Both the book and music chain and the bank exposed themselves to
potential litigation by their inaction, Spring said.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the bank employee, he said, ``If this had happened
in the early '90s, he would have been fired because of the
recession and because at the time everyone was nervous over sexual
harassment.''
</P>
<P>
   Barring blatant wrongdoing, though, many companies are pursuing
the path of least resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a slacker comes in to work at 10 a.m. instead of 8 a.m.,
maybe the company needs to rethink that worker's schedule,'' said
Erisa Ojimba, compensation expert for Salary.com, a salary-resource
Web site based in Wellesley, Mass. ``Maybe they're not their most
productive before 10 a.m.''

U.S. TO OFFER $1 BILLION A YEAR IN LOANS TO FIGHT AIDS IN AFRICA 
</HEADLINE>
  (With: SAFRICA-AIDS-U.N.) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States plans to offer sub-Saharan
African nations $1 billion in loans annually to finance the
purchase of American AIDS drugs and medical services, a program
that greatly increases the money available to combat the disease in
a region that has become its epicenter.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which will be announced by the U.S. Export-Import
Bank on Wednesday, comes after five multinational drug companies
agreed in May to cut the prices they charged African nations for
drugs to combat AIDS and the HIV virus. The loans will help poor
nations to buy the drugs, which are expensive even at discounted
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Africa already has 50 million people infected with the AIDS
virus, and doing more to fight the disease there has become a
central goal of the Clinton administration and several European
countries. The problem is so acute, and the funding so inadequate,
that international health officials estimate that only 5 percent of
Africans who carry the AIDS virus are even aware of the fact.
</P>
<P>
   But wealthy nations have only just begun to make money available
to match their vocal pledges to address the problem. The United
Nations estimated recently that the amount of money devoted to
fight the disease in Africa needed to rise tenfold to $3 billion
annually if the nations hardest hit were to make significant
progress in education, prevention and care.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is at least a first step in showing the world that Africa
is important to the United States and that we can make a dent in
this terrible problem,'' said James A. Harmon, president of the
Export-Import Bank, which is an independent government agency
financed by Congress. ``We think that this is the most significant
funding commitment by any international institution to date.''
</P>
<P>
   Harmon said he expected that export promotion agencies in Europe
and Japan would match the U.S. initiative. He estimated that
together wealthy nations could make up to $3 billion available in
annual financing to African governments that wanted to buy
pharmaceuticals, equipment and services.
</P>
<P>
   The loans are not without complications. Several Clinton
administration officials said that the administration was split
about the wisdom of the Export-Import bank's action, with some
officials arguing that it does not make sense for the United States
to lend African countries billions of dollars in export credits as
Congress is being pressed to forgive past loans.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the U.S. loans would be provided at commercial interest
rates that now average about 7 percent, though a small percentage
might be offered at a lower concessional rate, bank officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Wealthy countries and international lending agencies are seeking
to forgive as much as $100 billion in past development loans to the
most indebted nations, including many in Africa hard-hit by AIDS.
Some Clinton administration officials had promoted debt relief to a
reluctant Republican-led Congress as the best way for the United
States to fight AIDS, because it would free up money that African
countries would otherwise have to devote to paying interest on
their debt.
</P>
<P>
   The loans are also likely to increase a raging debate in the
development community over the best way to tackle AIDS. Many
African nations and private charity groups have criticized
multinational pharmaceutical companies for being slow to provide
cut-rate drugs to the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what the United States is doing is laudable,'' said
Koby Koomson, Ghana's ambassador in Washington, referring to the
new loan program. ``But the pharmaceutical companies need to come
around and see that the only way to fight this pandemic is to
donate whatever is necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States loans could also help American pharmaceutical
companies prevent the spread of generic knock-offs of their
profitable AIDS drugs to Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has said that it is exploring the possibility
of helping African nations buy generic AIDS drugs from Brazil and
India for less money than even the discounted prices Western drug
companies might charge for the original product. The drug companies
consider generic alternatives a violation of their intellectual
property.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems unlikely that Brazil, India or other nations that
produce such drugs for home consumption would have the export
financing available to help African nations buy the goods. The U.S.
loans, along with a recent commitment by the World Bank to provide
at least $500 million to help African nations set up anti-AIDS
initiatives, give added incentive to African countries to treat
many of their AIDS- and HIV-infected citizens with Western
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Even at 90 percent discounts, a typical cocktail of
AIDS-suppressing drugs might cost $2,000 a year for a single
patient in Africa, more than four times the average per capita
income in many of the worst afflicted countries.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Gayle, a senior technical adviser for the U.N. AIDS
program, based in Geneva, called the Export-Import bank action ``a
major announcement'' that takes a big step toward providing the $3
billion in annual funding commitments that his agency said was
necessary to fight the disease in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But he stressed that the problem was much broader than a lack of
AIDS drugs. African nations need to set up education and prevention
efforts and develop the medical infrastructure to administer drugs
effectively before they can make good use of loans to purchase
medicine, he said. This is the first time the Export-Import bank
has offered money for drug purchases by any nation, Harmon said.
Moreover, the government bank plans to make the financing available
for five years to the 24 eligible sub-Saharan African nations, an
unusually long term for loans that are considered among the highest
risk that the bank makes.
</P>
<P>
   He called the loans a pilot program that could be expanded or
scaled back depending on how African nations and drug companies
responded.  &QL;

SECURITY COUNCIL URGES MORE AIDS EDUCATION FOR PEACEKEEPERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: no byline) 
(With: SAFRIDA-AIDS) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ At the urging of the United States, the
Security Council has adopted a resolution asking for more attention
to education about AIDS to be given to peacekeeping troops, who
have been carriers of the disease, especially in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has been advising peacekeepers on the dangers
of AIDS and promoting the use of condoms for several years, and
this resolution reinforces these efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The American delegation failed, however, in the vote on Monday
to win a stronger resolution. It would have asked for a data base
to be kept on peacekeepers to track national efforts to monitor the
infection of the AIDS virus and test troops sent on U.N. missions.
</P>
<P>
   Countries supplying troops objected strenuously to that proposal
as an infringement of their control over military policies,
including health policies.

<P>
   PIONEER, Calif. _ It has been a long, long time since water
cascading from the Sierra Nevada here flowed through its riverbed
in anything like the way that nature intended.
</P>
<P>
   Here, as across California, the route is determined by a network
of elaborate plumbing: an extraordinary system of tunnels, canals,
pipes, dams and reservoirs, all built decades ago by the Pacific
Gas &AMP; Electric Co. in order to transform billions of gallons of
water into staggering amounts of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in one of the most ambitious plans ever under electrical
deregulation, every piece of California's system of 174 dams, 99
reservoirs, 68 power plants, 380 miles of artificial waterways and
hundreds of thousands of acres of land could be auctioned off by
sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
   The transfer would be the biggest of its kind, and, while
details are still being worked out by state regulators, has raised
concerns about how the need for providing electrical power would be
balanced against the need to protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
   California is one of a handful of states that has taken the lead
in deregulating utilities, as state lawmakers have moved to
separate the generation of power from its distribution. But
California, with its wealth of hydropower, must confront another
issue: how to keep a hand in the fate of the largest hydroelectric
system in the world after it has been broken into pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the worst thing that could happen would be the kind of
fragmentation that could result if these assets were sold off to
new owners,'' said Doug Wheeler, who was, until last year,
California's secretary of natural resources, and whose comments
reflected a sense of apprehension about the potential environmental
consequences of the planned transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, California's electric utilities have fallen under the
scrutiny of a state watchdog whose muscle to press for good conduct
is backed up a carrot: the authority to impose or withhold rate
increases.
</P>
<P>
   But under the deregulation plan _ intended to drive down
electricity rates, and approved by the California Legislature in a
unanimous vote _ all power generated in the state is supposed to be
opened to competition by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   That will relegate existing utilities to the role of mere
providers, while allowing the new owners of power generation to set
prices freely, without the oversight that has for long been built
into the system.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Gas and the state's other utilities have already sold
most of their conventional generating plants, to companies like
Duke Power and Enron Corp. But what is being debated now is
whether, when it comes to hydropower, the free market is really the
right recipe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Californians have been given a chance to decide how this
system will be managed and, in turn, how our rivers will be cared
for,'' said Thomas J. Graff, the Western regional director of
Environmental Defense, a private advocacy group, and a leader in
campaign by environmentalists and outdoorsmen to subject any
transfer to strict environmental conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this chance will evaporate like a pool of water in the hot
summer sun if we let it,'' Graff said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, about 40 percent of the nation's 96,000
megawatts of hydropower capacity is in private hands. Most of that
still falls under state regulation, but as other hydropower-rich
states like Oregon have begun to follow California toward the free
market, corporate executives and government officials have been
watching to see which way California turns at what could be a
critical juncture.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Indeed, a plan submitted on Tuesday by two U.S. senators would
seek to accelerate the deregulation process. A bill by the
senators, Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Phil Gramm, R- Texas, would
require all states to deregulate their electric power monopolies by
2002.
</P>
<P>
   By federal law, the conditions under which dams operate are
supposed to be set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,
whose 30-year licenses spell out such details as how much of a
river's water must remain in its natural bed.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, though, the federal relicensing process has been
slow and so often delayed that it has kindled considerable
mistrust.
</P>
<P>
   In the most extreme example, the license for the dams on the
Mokelumne, which fuel the Pacific Gas hydropower plants near
Pioneer, expired in 1975, and has been renewed on a one-year basis
ever since, without modification, even as environmental concerns
have grown more intense.
</P>
<P>
   To fly over the remote, rugged canyons of the Sierras of
Northern and Central California is to see the extent to which the
appetite for the power delivered by Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric has
transformed the waterways.
</P>
<P>
   From Bakersfield in the south to near the Oregon border, the
hydropower system stretches for more than 300 miles. All along the
way, beneath soaring peaks and snowy meadows, streams and rivers
can be seen empty or diminished across long sections in which their
flow has been diverted into canals, tunnels and turbines.
</P>
<P>
   Among those blocked or drained, some of which date from the
early part of the 20th century, include portions of the Feather,
Yuba, American, Kern, Stanislaus, San Joaquin and the Eel, as well
as the Mokelumne, where in the summer as is typical _ as many as 19
gallons in 20 is channeled away from the riverbed.
</P>
<P>
   What is at stake, according to a 1996 report by a team of
scientists convened by the U.S. Forest Service, are rivers and
streamside areas ``the most altered and impaired habitats of the
Sierra.'' The report said that dams were principally at fault.
</P>
<P>
   Among the major casualties have been populations of migratory
fish like the salmon and steelhead, prevented by dams from
returning to their river spawning grounds, and resident varieties
like the trout, no longer able to thrive in rivers like the
Mokelumne and the Feather, because of dams and inadequate water
flows.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the river's natural course, the waters travel along
what amount to giant staircases, channeled almost horizontally
under mountains, through Ponderosa pine forests and along steep
granite cliffs before being sent plunging downward in a rush, in
order to turn the turbines that generate power.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, the Pacific Gas system generates some 3,800
megawatts of power per hour, or enough to light 4 million homes,
and estimates of its value have soared as high as $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In maneuvering leading up to the potential transfer, the
utility's parent corporation, PG&AMP;E Corp., has said that it would be
willing to spend as much as $175 million to improve the hydropower
system's environmental performance, in large part by reducing power
generation and increasing the flow of water through streambeds.
</P>
<P>
   But that offer was contingent on a deal that would allow PG&AMP;E
Corp. to buy the assets itself, bypassing the kind of public
bidding seen as most likely to bring ratepayers the highest return.
So far, PG&AMP;E has been unable to win approval for such a guarantee,
and it has said that unless it can do so, it sees no alternative
but to proceed with the auction, which it says might leave the
state, with limited legal powers, unable to force any kind of
environmental repair.
</P>
<P>
   No conditions have been set as to who might be deemed an
acceptable bidder. But if there were a selloff of dams, the
transfer would have to be approved by federal regulators, whose
main task would be to determine if the new buyer possessed the
resources necessary to operate the acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Any decision on how to proceed with a sale is now in the hands
of the state's Public Utilities Commission, which has spent the
last several months conducting hearings. The commission has ordered
a report, due in September, to examine the potential environmental
impact of any handover.
</P>
<P>
   In the Legislature, one leading Democrat, Fred Keeley, has
introduced a bill that would postpone the process, by authorizing
the state to purchase the utility's land and other assets and
retain them for up to six years while deciding whether to transfer
individual parcels to public agencies or to sell them to private
bidders.
</P>
<P>
   As one potential model for the kind of agreement that might be
built into any sale, some advocates point to an accord struck last
summer between the PG&AMP;E Corp. and state and federal agencies to
share the $50 million cost of removing five small hydropower dams
on Battle Creek, a tributary of the Trinity River.
</P>
<P>
   Those dams had been widely recognized as an impediment to salmon
and steelhead populations, and the announcement of the deal was
made jointly by the utility, Gov. Gray Davis of California, and
U.S. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt.
</P>
<P>
   Even if no other dams are to be razed, groups like Environmental
Defense have said that any transfer of ownership should be prefaced
at least by a deal that would restore water flows by a factor of 10
or 20 in rivers like the Mokelumne, in order to help restore fish
habitats.
</P>
<P>
   A report issued by the organization in California this week
estimated that such a move would result in only a 10 percent to 20
percent decrease in hydropower generation.
</P>
<P>
   Graff, the regional director, said the price tag for an
acceptable package of environmental repair would be about $400
million.
</P>
<P>
   At their San Francisco headquarters, PG&AMP;E Corp. officials said
they were preparing a proposal that they said would balance the
need for power generation and environmental protection on
condition, again, that the dams and other assets remain in the
hands of the parent company.
</P>
<P>
   They also warned that it would be foolhardy to move too
drastically to reign in hydropower, particularly now, at a time
when surging demand has been tasting California's capacity to
generate electricity, and when alternative means of  &QC; power
generation carry environmental consequences of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all comes down to the fact that the state needs electric
power, and this is a clean way to provide it,'' said Jon Tremayne,
a Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric spokesman.

 &HT;    EDS. RUNS WITH COVERDELL-MAIN, COVERDELL-MEDIA
 &HT;    `He was a great, great man'
 &HT;    By Alan Judd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Once, when he was chairman of the state Republican
Party, Paul Coverdell spent a hot Saturday at a county fair in
North Georgia. As always, he was spreading the Republican word. And
as usual, despite the casual setting, he was dressed in coat and
tie.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Raudonis, a longtime aide, recalls that when he asked why,
Coverdell responded: ``Well, I've noticed that if there's ever any
kind of emergency and people are trying to figure out what to do,
they always go to the guy with the tie on.''
</P>
<P>
   For three decades, as a Georgia lawmaker, state party leader,
Peace Corps director and U.S. senator, Paul Coverdell was the man
people went to.
</P>
<P>
   As word of his death spread Tuesday, many of those who counted
on Coverdell said they couldn't fathom a world in which they
couldn't turn to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable,'' said state Rep. Bob Irvin of Atlanta, the
Georgia House minority leader, who helped Coverdell build the state
Republican Party's credibility and viability. ``He was my oldest
and best friend in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We shall miss him as we would miss our own son,'' former
President Bush, one of Coverdell's closest friends, said in a
statement. ``We loved him dearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell's death at age 61 came as he reached the pinnacle of a
life in politics. Although less than two years into his second
six-year term, he was the fourth-highest Republican in the Senate's
power structure. And he was the Senate liaison for the presumptive
Republican presidential nominee, Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   It was a heady time for Paul Douglas Coverdell, an insurance
agent turned politician who moved to Atlanta as a teenager in the
early 1950s from his native Des Moines, Iowa. After graduating from
Northside High School, he attended the University of Missouri,
where he received a bachelor's degree in journalism. He spent two
years in the Army before returning to Atlanta to take over his
family's insurance business. Soon, his interests turned to
politics.
</P>
<P>
   In his first political contest, in 1970, he was elected to the
state Senate from a north Atlanta district. At the time, Republican
legislators were rare, so Coverdell _ then considered a moderate _
formed alliances with like-minded Democrats. By the late 1970s,
then-Lt. Gov. Zell Miller had appointed Coverdell to chair the
Senate Retirement Committee _ a first, said a former Senate
colleague, Pierre Howard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the hardest-working, most disciplined, most
incisive public servants I've ever known,'' said Howard, who later
became lieutenant governor. ``There was nobody who surpassed his
work ethic and his ethics and his devotion to what he was doing.
You might not agree with him on an issue here or there, but you
always knew that he was sincere and that he was well-informed and
that he was going to work hard to achieve the objective that he
had.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of meanness in politics,'' Howard said, ``but he
wasn't one of the mean people. He was one of the nice people.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, Coverdell formed a close friendship with
another politician, a relationship that would help propel him to a
higher political level.
</P>
<P>
   He met George Bush, then the U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations, at an Atlanta dinner party. When Bush ran for president in
1980, Coverdell was one of his earliest supporters, serving as his
finance chairman in Georgia. He was a frequent visitor to Bush's
home in Kennebunkport, Maine. Last month Coverdell and his wife,
Nancy, attended Barbara Bush's 75th birthday party there, said Jean
Becker, a spokeswoman for the former president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush lost the Republican nomination to Ronald Reagan in 1980,
but as vice president, he remained close to Coverdell. And when
Bush became president in 1989 _ inaugurated on Coverdell's 50th
birthday _ one of his first acts was to appoint Coverdell director
of the Peace Corps.
</P>
<P>
   In that job, Coverdell was such a workaholic, Raudonis said,
that when once asked to list his hobbies, all he could come up with
was ``dining out.''
</P>
<P>
   After an Asian tour, Raudonis said, Coverdell proudly pointed
out that he had never checked into a hotel. Instead, if he slept at
all, it was on planes between destinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul was the type who's constantly on the go,'' said Raudonis,
who worked for Coverdell for 10 years in Georgia and Washington.
``The idea of having to take 12 hours off to go to a hotel, he
couldn't figure out why anybody would do that.''
</P>
<P>
   After three years, Coverdell left the Peace Corps in 1992 to
seek what friends say he had long wanted: a U.S. Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   In a close race, he unseated Democrat Wyche Fowler. He was
re-elected in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Although he ascended to a leadership position in the Senate and
maintained a remarkably full schedule, Coverdell had found time in
recent years to relax a bit, friends say. He developed a passion
for gardening, and his recent Christmas cards included a picture of
his flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My greatest regret for him is that he didn't have the time
that he deserved to enjoy himself more,'' Howard said. ``I feel a
real sense of loss. He was a great, great man.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ The White House described the scene inside Camp
David on Tuesday as one of little sleep and unwavering intensity,
with President Clinton negotiating until dawn with Prime Minister
Ehud Barak of Israel and then, after just a few hours' sleep,
meeting with the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Informally, officials were suggesting that Clinton's artificial
deadline of Wednesday morning, when he is scheduled to leave for
Japan, could be stretched as much as 21 hours, an element of
information that added to a steadily building drama.
</P>
<P>
   At times on Tuesday, it seemed the impossible might be possible:
an agreement on all the issues, including Jerusalem. At other
times, the temperature receded back to the more sober expectation
of a rather modest agreement and a second summit meeting before
Arafat's Sept. 13 deadline for declaring a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   These polar extremes were fed by the pitch of diplomacy that
dribbled through the phone wires of the mountain retreat. Members
of the Israeli delegation have called home in the last 24 hours,
leaking news that the question of Jerusalem had been under
discussion since Monday and hinting at progress on this most
intractable issue.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Arafat was reported to have called his headquarters
in Gaza and told his aides to spread the word that he was
considering packing his bags and leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides were playing to their constituents, and preparing
public opinion for posssible outcomes. Arafat, presumably, was
showing that he was not going to give up on his long-held stance
that East Jerusalem must be the capital of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the same script, Barak was demonstrating that he was
a man of reason, and was prepared as Israel television reported
Tuesday night to make ``unprecedented steps'' toward the
Palestinian position on Jerusalem. If an agreement were not reached
on the future status of Jerusalem, Barak would be able to say that
he had tried his best and that the Palestinians were unmovable.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that Jerusalem was on the table was itself progress
over the seven-year time line of negotiations between the
Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was astonished by the degree of progress in the last few
hours,'' said an Israeli who was in contact with the delegation by
telephone and who was expressing the line of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Only several months ago, Jerusalem was a virtually taboo subject
in back-channel talks in Stockholm, where the top negotiators of
Arafat and Barak met and made progress on a variety of issues.
These included what might constitute the territorial boundaries of
a Palestinian state and what would be the fate of the three million
Palestinian refugees scattered across the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   But on Jerusalem, there was only generalized talk in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   According to reports attributed to Israeli officials, the
Israeli delegation at Camp David was presenting a plan that would
incorporate the Israeli bedroom communities that are now a de facto
part of the capital into the legal entity of Jerusalem. Among the
West Bank settlements near Jerusalem being mentioned are Maale
Advmim and Givat Zeev.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also calls for areas populated by Palestinians, such as
Beit Hanina and the Shuafat refugee camp, to be placed under
Palestinian control. The moves together would provide more
demographic balance in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   But this version of a solution for Jerusalem leaves unanswered
the top concerns of Arafat, who has insisted all along that East
Jerusalem, annexed by the Israelis in the 1967 war, should be the
capital of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   From the Palestinian point of view, the Israeli plan does not
deal with the heart of the matter: it leaves under Israeli
sovereignty the old city of Jerusalem, home of the main religious
sites of Judaism, Islam and Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some suggestions from outside the Camp David
negotiations in the last few days that the future of the Old City
could be set aside for future generations to decide. But there have
also been reports that Arafat has stood firm on Jerusalem,
insisting that no agreement can come out of these negotiations
without Palestinian control over the Al Aqsa Mosque and the Church
of the Holy Sepulcher.
</P>
<P>
   And from the Israeli side, Yitzhak Herzog, the Israeli cabinet
secretary, said in a speech before the Israeli Policy Forum in
Washington on Tuesday, that Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem was
one of the sacrosanct ``red lines'' of the Barak government.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's spokesman, Joe Lockhart, stood studiously above the
fray on the issue of Jerusalem. He did not utter the word Jerusalem
or mention any of the other substantive matters, such as
Palestinian refugees or the boundaries of a new Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, through the release of bits of minutae on who was
meeting with whom or who was not meeting with whom, he depicted
Clinton as a president waiting to do some down-to-the-wire
persuasion with Barak and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has confidently held to its belief that the
Palestinian and Israeli leaders see the value in forging an
agreement under the auspices of Clinton, recognizing that he is
steeped in the issues.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing Arafat for about an hour on Tuesday morning,
Clinton ``stands ready to talk to either leaders separately,
together, the negotiators, whatever we think is peaceful and
constructive,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   In their eighth day, the negotiations have produced a
roller-coaster of emotions, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go through various emotions, ranging from moments where
you see promise, to moments where the only thing you see is
frustration,'' Lockhart said. ``Not only the president, the leaders
and all the delegations, have run the entire range over the last
eight days.''

six-year term, he was the fourth-highest Republican in the Senate's
power structure. And he was the Senate liaison for the presumptive
Republican presidential nominee, Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   It was a heady time for Paul Douglas Coverdell, an insurance
agent turned politician who moved to Atlanta as a teenager in the
early 1950s from his native Des Moines, Iowa. After graduating from
Northside High School, he attended the University of Missouri,
where he received a bachelor's degree in journalism. He spent two
years in the Army before returning to Atlanta to take over his
family's insurance business. Soon, his interests turned to
politics.
</P>
<P>
   In his first political contest, in 1970, he was elected to the
state Senate from a north Atlanta district. At the time, Republican
legislators were rare, so Coverdell _ then considered a moderate _
formed alliances with like-minded Democrats. By the late 1970s,
then-Lt. Gov. Zell Miller had appointed Coverdell to chair the
Senate Retirement Committee _ a first, said a former Senate
colleague, Pierre Howard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the hardest-working, most disciplined, most
incisive public servants I've ever known,'' said Howard, who later
became lieutenant governor. ``There was nobody who surpassed his
work ethic and his ethics and his devotion to what he was doing.
You might not agree with him on an issue here or there, but you
always knew that he was sincere and that he was well-informed and
that he was going to work hard to achieve the objective that he
had.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of meanness in politics,'' Howard said, ``but he
wasn't one of the mean people. He was one of the nice people.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, Coverdell formed a close friendship with
another politician, a relationship that would help propel him to a
higher political level.
</P>
<P>
   He met George Bush, then the U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations, at an Atlanta dinner party. When Bush ran for president in
1980, Coverdell was one of his earliest supporters, serving as his
finance chairman in Georgia. He was a frequent visitor to Bush's
home in Kennebunkport, Maine. Last month Coverdell and his wife,
Nancy, attended Barbara Bush's 75th birthday party there, said Jean
Becker, a spokeswoman for the former president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush lost the Republican nomination to Ronald Reagan in 1980,
but as vice president, he remained close to Coverdell. And when
Bush became president in 1989 _ inaugurated on Coverdell's 50th
birthday _ one of his first acts was to appoint Coverdell director
of the Peace Corps.
</P>
<P>
   In that job, Coverdell was such a workaholic, Raudonis said,
that when once asked to list his hobbies, all he could come up with
was ``dining out.''
</P>
<P>
   After an Asian tour, Raudonis said, Coverdell proudly pointed
out that he had never checked into a hotel. Instead, if he slept at
all, it was on planes between destinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul was the type who's constantly on the go,'' said Raudonis,
who worked for Coverdell for 10 years in Georgia and Washington.
``The idea of having to take 12 hours off to go to a hotel, he
couldn't figure out why anybody would do that.''
</P>
<P>
   After three years, Coverdell left the Peace Corps in 1992 to
seek what friends say he had long wanted: a U.S. Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   In a close race, he unseated Democrat Wyche Fowler. He was
re-elected in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Although he ascended to a leadership position in the Senate and
maintained a remarkably full schedule, Coverdell had found time in
recent years to relax a bit, friends say. He developed a passion
for gardening, and his recent Christmas cards included a picture of
his flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My greatest regret for him is that he didn't have the time
that he deserved to enjoy himself more,'' Howard said. ``I feel a
real sense of loss. He was a great, great man.''

SPORTS COLUMN: THE WAY OLD TOM MORRIS DID IT _ 8 TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ Stadiums and arenas come and go every
few decades. Yankee Stadium, Fenway Park and Wrigley Field have
endured longer than most. Lambeau Field is a relative youngster.
Madison Square Garden's address has never been the same for too
long. But golf's spiritual stage, the Old Course at St. Andrews, is
not that much different than when God designed it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1574 a University of St. Andrews student, James Melville,
wrote in his diary that his father had provided him with ``clubs
and balls for golf but nothing for hand tennis or drinking in the
pub.'' His father knew best.
</P>
<P>
   This auld gray toon is known as the ``Home of Golf,'' and at 8
The Links, in an 18th century stone-and-mortar building across from
the British Open throngs huddled behind the out-of-bounds stakes
near the 18th green, is golf's most enduring pro shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom Morris Golf Shop (established 1848),'' reads the sign
above the window display of shirts and sweaters where the original
club-making workbench was. ``Open Champion
1861-62-64-67-68-69-70-72.''
</P>
<P>
   Next to the blue door with the small white-on-black sign ``Tom
Morris Ltd. registered office'' is a life-size wood cutout of Old
Tom himself: tweed cap, bushy beard, green suit, holding a baffy.
Every so often, a visitor stops and poses next to that cutout for a
snapshot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some customers know who Old Tom was, some don't,'' the shop
owner, Bryan Anderson, said. ``During the '90 Open, some
chock-a-block middle-aged woman from the other side of the pond was
in here and said, `Who is Tom Morris anyway?' and there was this
sudden deathly hush.''
</P>
<P>
   For anyone else who didn't know, Tiger Woods put Old Tom in
perspective last month at the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach when his
15-shot victory set a record for a major tournament. The previous
record was Old Tom's 13-shot victory in the 1862 British Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no reaction in town,'' Bryan Anderson said. ``It was
time that record was broken. Maybe if Tiger had done it in the
Open, there would have been a reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Over here there is only one ``Open.'' It starts Thursday on the
same first tee where Old Tom drove off and ends Sunday on the same
18th green across from Old Tom's shop where he made golf clubs
that, compared to today's high-tech shapes and styles, resembled
hoes and rakes. But you could shoot a score with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old Tom died upstairs,'' Bryan Anderson said. ``So did Young
Tom.''
</P>
<P>
   The sign on the shop boasts of the eight Morris victories in the
Open: Old Tom's four, Young Tom's four, all at Prestwick. Three
years after Young Tom's last victory, both his wife and first baby
didn't survive childbirth, then he died suddenly at age 24. Of a
broken heart, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Old Tom's great-great granddaughter, Sheila Mould, his only
surviving relative, still lives upstairs from the shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather,'' Bryan Anderson said, ``came into partnership
with Old Tom's great-granddaughter, Bunty Mould. That's how I got
to be in the shop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And when we looked behind that wall over there,'' said Bryan's
brother Michael, ``I found an old gutta-percha ball and an old
hickory shaft.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1960 Open, Arnold Palmer walked into the shop with
Gary Player's golf clubs. Bryan Anderson's father, Morris,
regripped them.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the 1964 Open we were still making clubs here,'' Anderson
said. ``When my father brought some Open hats into the shop, my
grandfather told him: `Take them back. This is a golf shop.' My
father said, `I can't, I've already sold some.' When the remaining
hats sold out quickly, my grandfather didn't object to my father
bringing in other merchandise.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Morris shop still sells some clubs, during the Open
it's strictly shirts, sweaters, hats and Old Course souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever visitors walked out the door with a purchase during the
practice rounds this week, golfers were coming up to the 18th
green, as Tiger Woods himself was early Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, he's putting,'' someone said.
</P>
<P>
   From beyond the deep swale known as the Valley of Sin in front
of the 18th green, the champion of the Open across the pond was not
chipping or pitching his ball. Using a putter, he knocked it across
the dip in the smooth fairway and watched it roll up onto the
green.
</P>
<P>
   Just the way Old Tom Morris did.

 &HT;    EDS. RUNS WITH COVERDELL-MAIN, COVERDELL-MEDIA
 &HT;    `He was a great, great man'
 &HT;    By Alan Judd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Once, when he was chairman of the state Republican
Party, Paul Coverdell spent a hot Saturday at a county fair in
North Georgia. As always, he was spreading the Republican word. And
as usual, despite the casual setting, he was dressed in coat and
tie.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Raudonis, a longtime aide, recalls that when he asked why,
Coverdell responded: ``Well, I've noticed that if there's ever any
kind of emergency and people are trying to figure out what to do,
they always go to the guy with the tie on.''
</P>
<P>
   For three decades, as a Georgia lawmaker, state party leader,
Peace Corps director and U.S. senator, Paul Coverdell was the man
people went to.
</P>
<P>
   As word of his death spread Tuesday, many of those who counted
on Coverdell said they couldn't fathom a world in which they
couldn't turn to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable,'' said state Rep. Bob Irvin of Atlanta, the
Georgia House minority leader, who helped Coverdell build the state
Republican Party's credibility and viability. ``He was my oldest
and best friend in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We shall miss him as we would miss our own son,'' former
President Bush, one of Coverdell's closest friends, said in a
statement. ``We loved him dearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell's death at age 61 came as he reached the pinnacle of a
life in politics. Although less than two years into his second
six-year term, he was the fourth-highest Republican in the Senate's

MATTHAEUS IN TROUBLE WITH METROSTARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED ROBLEDO  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If German legend Lothar Matthaeus thought he embarrassed himself
in the European Championships, think of the humorous reaction
overseas if the New York/New Jersey MetroStars cancel his contract
today.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of reporting to the MetroStars after Germany's
disastrous first-round exit in the Euro championships, Matthaeus
was pictured in a German magazine tanning on the beach in St.
Tropez in the south of France. This was after he told MetroStars
officials he was undergoing treatment for a back injury he suffered
during the championships.
</P>
<P>
   It's a slap in the face to his New York teammates, whom he
publicly criticized for not working hard enough. Matthaeus, 39, was
signed in the offseason to lure fans and improve the MetroStars,
who had the league's worst combined record the first four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But when Matthaeus left to join Germany's national team, the
MetroStars were 3-6-1 with him in the lineup. The team went 9-1-1
in his absence to tie Kansas City for the most points in the MLS
with 38, grabbing a big lead in the Eastern Division standings as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good,'' midfielder Peter Villegas told the Newark Star- Ledger
when asked about the possibility of Matthaeus' release. ``Now maybe
we can get somebody who can help us.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears Matthaeus doesn't plan to return anyway. He told
Kicker Magazine he is expecting to be released. New York has said
it will make an announcement today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly looks as though we are heading for an amicable
separation,'' said Matthaeus. ``The club doesn't need me and I
don't need them. It's a shame it has not worked out, but I can live
without football.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's his prerogative,'' New York coach Octavio Zambrano
said. ``A player like him could take a lot of jobs. The ball is
really in his court, but if he returns we need to see a change in
Lothar's attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   New York/New Jersey general manager Nick Sakiewicz said he is
considering putting Matthaeus on the 15-day disabled list, but many
of the MetroStars players would rather remember the old Matthaeus,
not this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched him when I was younger and remember him from the
World Cup as an incredible player,'' said midfielder Mark Chung.
``I was looking forward to playing with him, but it has been
completely the opposite. It didn't match the hope.''
</P>
<P>
   The only reason Matthaeus may not be released is MLS has told
the MetroStars they will not receive another marquee foreigner as a
replacement. With depth an issue in the playoffs, Matthaeus'
experience could come in handy.
</P>
<P>
   Zambrano said he would welcome Matthaeus' return, but he's
concerned about his attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``The million dollar question is whether he's committed to this
team,'' Zambrano said. ``Lothar committed would be a great asset.
Anything else would be a disturbance.''
</P>
<P>
   Zambrano said the suggestion that New York only improved because
of Matthaeus' absence is not fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was coincidental,'' Zambrano said. ``When he left, we got
Steve Jolley, Daniel Hernandez, Roy Myers, Clint Mathis, and then
Tab Ramos was healthy again. That's the reason we've had this
recent success. Again, Lother com &QL;
</P>
<P>
   mitted would add to that success.''
</P>
<P>
   What an unfortunate ending for the U.S. men's national soccer
team in last weekend's opening game of Group E World Cup
qualification.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes away from a 1-0 victory over Guatemala in the heat
and humidity of Mazatenango, Carlos Ruiz tied the match with an
88th-minute goal and forced the U.S. to settle for a 1-1 draw.
</P>
<P>
   It was U.S. coach Bruce Arena's first Cup qualifying match. He
said a point on the road and wins at home are the keys to
advancing, but three points on the road would have helped
tremendously.
</P>
<P>
   Arena also could have made better substitutions. With a 1-0 lead
and 20 minutes to play, he still had three substitutions left.
Instead of bringing in defenders and removing forwards to fight off
a constant Guatemala attack, he sent in offensive-minded
midfielders Frankie Hejduk and Tab Ramos for forward Cobi Jones and
midfielder Earnie Stewart. He then traded defenders (Greg Vanney
for Eddie Pope).
</P>
<P>
   Why not leave in Pope, take out forward Ante Razov of Whittier
and bring in Vanney as a fifth defender? Oh well, it's easy to
second guess now. It's also easy to second guess the Mexican
official in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz, who scored the tying goal, never should have been in the
match anyway. Ruiz, who received a yellow card in the 80th minute,
ran over American keeper Kasey Keller before his goal. The Mexican
referee amazingly did not even whistle a foul.
</P>
<P>
   Even referees need to get home safely. How do you think his
three-hour drive back to Guatemala City for a flight home would
have been if he had tossed Ruiz?

TAKING OVER THE CREATIVE CONTROLS AT DIOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By CATHY HORYN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ To look at Hedi Slimane _ the Nouvelle Vague suits, the
crest of hair foaming down his angular head like two colliding
rogue waves _ is to imagine someone too cool for anyone over 40 to
identify with. Yet Slimane, who Monday was to begin his new job as
the men's wear designer at Christian Dior, turns out to be
something of a square. He often talks about character and
self-respect, two of the more negotiable virtues in the fashion
business, and has an affinity for the cultivated worlds of Yves
Saint Laurent and Karl Lagerfeld, whose long careers practically
make them geezers.
</P>
<P>
   Over breakfast one morning last week in Paris, Slimane, 32,
acknowledged that many fashion insiders were surprised by his
decision to go to Dior, which gets a lot of attention from John
Galliano's women's clothes but hardly causes a stir in men's wear.
Slimane made his name at Saint Laurent, where his sexually charged
men's clothes also found converts among women. Last spring he was
being courted by Gucci, which wanted to finance a Slimane label,
and by Patrizio Bertelli, the Prada chief executive, who wanted him
to design Jil Sander. If one knows Slimane, and the very French way
he thinks, his choice was not surprising. As he said of the move
from Saint Laurent to Dior, from one venerable French house to
another, ``It's just a walk across the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Saint Laurent, one may recall, began his career at Dior. So in a
sense, the look and culture that became Saint Laurent, and which
Slimane carefully grafted onto his men's style _ the sleek
``smoking'' pantsuits, the razor-sharp shoulders _ had its roots at
Dior. Slimane pointed out that although Saint Laurent made men's
wear fabrics popular in women's fashion, Dior was using fabrics
like glen plaid years before.
</P>
<P>
   Like Lagerfeld at Chanel, Slimane may be more at home working
with established references than inventing his own. So he wouldn't
have been automatically tempted by Gucci's offer to bankroll him.
There were also issues of creative control, which surfaced soon
after Gucci acquired Saint Laurent and Tom Ford assumed the title
of creative director for both houses. As hot as Slimane was at
Saint Laurent, Gucci made it clear that it wanted total control
over its acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   But as Slimane said, ``the No. 1 point for me was not the
control; it was the culture.'' Gucci, by contrast, has a very
quick, mobile culture _ one could almost call it a cellular phone
culture _ with decisions made by executives who may be in London,
Paris or Milan. That is not Slimane's style.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it should be said that Slimane will bring fresh buzz
to Dior, and that is something that Bernard Arnault, the chairman
of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, which owns the house,
understands well.

NASDAQ TUMBLES AMID PROFIT-TAKING; DOW AND S&AMP;P ALSO OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   By KENNETH N. GILPIN

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Nasdaq composite index fell sharply Tuesday as
investors chose to take profits after pushing the technology-laden
index higher in each of the previous four sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq fell 97.50 points, or 2.3 percent, to 4,177.17. While
the decline in Nasdaq stocks was most pronounced, other major
market gauges also moved lower.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 64.35 points, or 0.6
percent, to 10,739.92, led lower by Intel, which fell 3 5/16, to
143. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 16.75 points, or
1.1 percent, to 1,493.74. General Electric, Pfizer and Lucent
Technologies were among the big losers. And the Russell 2000 index
of small company stocks fell 8.90, or 1.6 percent, to 536.28.
</P>
<P>
   Traders and analysts said the decline in prices, which came on
moderate volume, was warranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market has had a very nice move up over the last month or
so, especially technology stocks, and the averages and individual
stocks are very overbought,'' said Kenneth M. Sheinberg, head of
listed trading at SG Cowen. ``It is time to consolidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Contributing to the slide in Nasdaq were Qualcomm, JDS Uniphase
and Cisco Systems, which all fell by more than 2 points. In the
previous four sessions, the Nasdaq had gained 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although Intel fell during the day, it reported second-quarter
results that were better than expected after the market closed and
rallied as high as 147 after hours. It was not the only big company
to issue an earnings report after the close of trading.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and Apple Computer, two other technology heavyweights,
also reported results that were better than expected.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings numbers led some analysts to suggest that Tuesday's
sell-off may be short lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is there will be a bounce on Wednesday,'' said Arthur
Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies &AMP; Co. in Boston. ``The
market has moved a lot in the last week, and there was room to take
profits. But when we start focusing on these great earnings
numbers, I think we will see buying again.''
</P>
<P>
   Three stocks fell for every two that rose on the New York Stock
Exchange on Tuesday. About 910 million shares changed hands on the
Big Board.
</P>
<P>
   Some stocks, which had advanced smartly in advance of earnings
reports that were expected to be good, retreated once the news was
announced.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch, which rose 10 percent last week, was hit hard
Tuesday even though it reported earnings that exceeded Wall Street
estimates. Merrill fell 3}, to 128\.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna was another big loser. The nation's biggest health insurer
fell 6 15/16, to 59 11/16, after it reported results that fell
short of estimates.

WORCESTER OFFICIALS WEIGH LIABILITY IN WAREHOUSE FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANNA WEISS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. _ Walking through the Worcester Cold Storage
and Warehouse Co. building last October, Police K-9 Officer Daniel
Sullivan saw disturbing signs of life inside: mountains of trash,
piles of human waste, a stench so overwhelming that he feared for
the health of his dog.
</P>
<P>
   But while Sullivan apparently recorded his visit in a police
report, there is no sign that he reported the conditions to city
building inspectors, public health workers, or the warehouse owner.
A homeless couple, Tom Levesque and Julie Barnes, continued to
squat in the building for more than a month, until a candle that
fell over in their makeshift home last December sparked the fire
that killed six firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   Now, city officials are questioning whether Sullivan had a legal
obligation to report signs of the couple's presence to city
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something I'm looking into,'' Worcester Solicitor David
Moore said. City officials have become concerned about liability,
he said, since two fire-related lawsuits were filed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This type of incident has a way of ending up in a number of
lawsuits, so we're watching carefully,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Three firefighters' widows sued Kwan and his wife in April,
saying they failed to keep the building secure from trespassers.
And last week, the owner of a diner next to the warehouse sued the
city, Kwan, and a demolition company, saying their negligence led
to the loss of his business.
</P>
<P>
   It was a complaint from a friend of Barnes and Levesque that
directed Sullivan to their cluttered corner of the massive
warehouse on Oct. 27, 1999. In his report, Sullivan described the
squalid conditions he found.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't take a step,'' he wrote, ``without walking on
rotting garbage and feces.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan's report was read to a Worcester grand jury in
February, before the panel voted to charge the homeless pair with
involuntary manslaughter. The grand jury minutes became public this
month, when the couple's attorneys filed them in Barnes' and
Levesque's defense.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's failure to report the warehouse fire underlies the
criminal charges they face. But the city solicitor said he's not
sure whether Sullivan or anyone else had a legal obligation to
report the couple's presence in the vacant building.
</P>
<P>
   If notified, the city would have sent an inspector to the
building, said Doug Scott, principal building inspector in
Worcester's Department of Public Health and Code Enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he had an obligation, but it would have been a
good thing to notify code enforcement,'' Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   Months earlier, city officials had ordered the building's owner,
Framingham developer Ding On ``Tony'' Kwan, to improve security at
the warehouse. Kwan complied with the order in July, and did not
know about Sullivan's October visit, said Richard Rafferty, Kwan's
attorney. In November Kwan inspected the site from the outside,
Rafferty said, and saw no signs that people could get inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it inconceivable that a police officer would see what
this police officer supposedly saw, and not notify the property
authorities or the building owner. He had a duty,'' Rafferty said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Worcester Police Department nor District Attorney
John Conte's Office would comment on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a Worcester Superior Court judge earlier this week
denied Levesque's request to reduce his bail from $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Judge Thomas Hillman reduced Barnes' bail from
$75,000 to $25,000, and allowed her to be released into the custody
of a Maine couple that adopted Barnes' younger sister. But Hillman
said that Levesque does not have the safety net that the Kings are
providing for Barnes.

 &HT;    Loss of Coverdell is hard hit
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As a final judgment on the effectiveness of Paul
Coverdell's public career, consider the several vacancies that have
to be filled due to his untimely demise.
</P>
<P>
   Of primary importance is Coverdell's seat in the U.S. Senate,
which will demand two important decisions for Georgia: the first
from Gov. Roy Barnes, who has the power to appoint someone to fill
the immediate vacancy, and the second from the voters, who will
have their say in November.
</P>
<P>
   With a Democratic governor and eight Republican congressmen, the
mind trips over all the possibilities for political drama in the
wake of this man, who went about politics in the most undramatic
way. But leave that speculation aside a moment.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of Coverdell also means Gov. George W. Bush will
have to find another Republican member of Congress he can trust as
much. That may not be easy. Coverdell's loyalty to Bush and his
father, who appointed him Peace Corps director, was unquestioned,
and he was well-known for keeping his mouth shut.
</P>
<P>
   The loss comes just a couple of weeks before the Republican
National Convention, which could be unfortunate timing. The
backroom wrangles and grudge matches with long genealogies that
cause problems at political conventions, were Coverdell's metier.
</P>
<P>
   We can be brief about his skills as a campaigner in his own
behalf. But anyone who was in that steaming hot hotel banquet room
at the 1984 New Orleans convention, when Coverdell pulled Pat
Swindall out of his hat like a rabbit, transforming the disgraced
congressmen into a compromise choice for chair of the bitterly
divided delegation, knows what a politician he was.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is going to have to find someone to act more like a
grownup. Not that there aren't those who do, but few would deny
that with the passage of Coverdell, the overall maturity level of
that body will decline considerably.
</P>
<P>
   This shy, sometimes awkward Iowa native served the state of
Georgia with a genuine respect for the institution, and never did
this shine through more clearly than in the impeachment trial of
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   An intense man with an active agenda, Coverdell might have
wished to be remembered for more active service. But it was the
essence of the man that when others were running to the
microphones, he conducted himself with the sobriety and decorum of
a judge.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate seemed to bring out something in him that was not so
obvious before his election in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   To have been deeply involved in Georgia Republican politics over
the past three decades, one almost inevitably has to have made a
lot of people mad at you. Coverdell was more deeply involved than
most. But many of those who have had their differences with him are
likely to feel the absence of one who took the interests of the
party so seriously.
</P>
<P>
   He was a power in the party before Newt Gingrich, and after. The
state's Republican establishment has now suffered two deep blows.
Whoever emerges as the GOP Senate candidate this fall will likely
also be running for the symbolic post of standard-bearer for the
state party.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia has never been unimportant to either of the presidential
campaigns, and a Senate election _ which could have a crucial
impact on the margin in the Senate a few years down the road - will
put the state at center stage for both national parties. It is the
sort of twist Paul Coverdell might have relished.

 &HT;    RUNS WITH COVERDELL-MAIN, COVERDELL-MEDIA
 &HT;    `He was a great, great man'
 &HT;    By Alan Judd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Once, when he was chairman of the state Republican
Party, Paul Coverdell spent a hot Saturday at a county fair in
North Georgia. As always, he was spreading the Republican word. And
as usual, despite the casual setting, he was dressed in coat and
tie.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Raudonis, a longtime aide, recalls that when he asked why,
Coverdell responded: ``Well, I've noticed that if there's ever any
kind of emergency and people are trying to figure out what to do,
they always go to the guy with the tie on.''
</P>
<P>
   For three decades, as a Georgia lawmaker, state party leader,
Peace Corps director and U.S. senator, Paul Coverdell was the man
people went to.
</P>
<P>
   As word of his death spread Tuesday, many of those who counted
on Coverdell said they couldn't fathom a world in which they
couldn't turn to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable,'' said state Rep. Bob Irvin of Atlanta, the
Georgia House minority leader, who helped Coverdell build the state
Republican Party's credibility and viability. ``He was my oldest
and best friend in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We shall miss him as we would miss our own son,'' former
President Bush, one of Coverdell's closest friends, said in a
statement. ``We loved him dearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell's death at age 61 came as he reached the pinnacle of a
life in politics. Although less than two years into his second
six-year term, he was the fourth-highest Republican in the Senate's
power structure. And he was the Senate liaison for the presumptive
Republican presidential nominee, Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   It was a heady time for Paul Douglas Coverdell, an insurance
agent turned politician who moved to Atlanta as a teenager in the
early 1950s from his native Des Moines, Iowa. After graduating from
Northside High School, he attended the University of Missouri,
where he received a bachelor's degree in journalism. He spent two
years in the Army before returning to Atlanta to take over his
family's insurance business. Soon, his interests turned to
politics.
</P>
<P>
   In his first political contest, in 1970, he was elected to the
state Senate from a north Atlanta district. At the time, Republican
legislators were rare, so Coverdell _ then considered a moderate _
formed alliances with like-minded Democrats. By the late 1970s,
then-Lt. Gov. Zell Miller had appointed Coverdell to chair the
Senate Retirement Committee _ a first, said a former Senate
colleague, Pierre Howard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the hardest-working, most disciplined, most
incisive public servants I've ever known,'' said Howard, who later
became lieutenant governor. ``There was nobody who surpassed his
work ethic and his ethics and his devotion to what he was doing.
You might not agree with him on an issue here or there, but you
always knew that he was sincere and that he was well-informed and
that he was going to work hard to achieve the objective that he
had.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of meanness in politics,'' Howard said, ``but he
wasn't one of the mean people. He was one of the nice people.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Coverdell formed a close friendship with another
politician, a relationship that would help propel him to a higher
political level.
</P>
<P>
   He met George Bush, then the U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations, at an Atlanta dinner party. When Bush ran for president in
1980, Coverdell was one of his earliest supporters, serving as his
finance chairman in Georgia. He was a frequent visitor to Bush's
home in Kennebunkport, Maine. Last month Coverdell and his wife,
Nancy, attended Barbara Bush's 75th birthday party there, said Jean
Becker, a spokeswoman for the former president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush lost the Republican nomination to Ronald Reagan in 1980,
but as vice president, he remained close to Coverdell. And when
Bush became president in 1989 _ inaugurated on Coverdell's 50th
birthday _ one of his first acts was to appoint Coverdell director
of the Peace Corps.
</P>
<P>
   In that job, Coverdell was such a workaholic, Raudonis said,
that when once asked to list his hobbies, all he could come up with
was ``dining out.''
</P>
<P>
   After an Asian tour, Raudonis said, Coverdell proudly pointed
out that he had never checked into a hotel. Instead, if he slept at
all, it was on planes between destinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul was the type who's constantly on the go,'' said Raudonis,
who worked for Coverdell for 10 years in Georgia and Washington.
``The idea of having to take 12 hours off to go to a hotel, he
couldn't figure out why anybody would do that.''
</P>
<P>
   After three years, Coverdell left the Peace Corps in 1992 to
seek what friends say he had long wanted: a U.S. Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   In a close race, he unseated Democrat Wyche Fowler. He was
re-elected in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Although he ascended to a leadership position in the Senate and
maintained a remarkably full schedule, Coverdell had found time in
recent years to relax a bit, friends say. He developed a passion
for gardening, and his recent Christmas cards included a picture of
his flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My greatest regret for him is that he didn't have the time
that he deserved to enjoy himself more,'' Howard said. ``I feel a
real sense of loss. He was a great, great man.''

   After an Asian tour, Raudonis said, Coverdell proudly pointed
out that he had never checked into a hotel. Instead, if he slept at
all, it was on planes between destinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul was the type who's constantly on the go,'' said Raudonis,
who worked for Coverdell for 10 years in Georgia and Washington.
``The idea of having to take 12 hours off to go to a hotel, he
couldn't figure out why anybody would do that.''
</P>
<P>
   After three years, Coverdell left the Peace Corps in 1992 to
seek what friends say he had long wanted: a U.S. Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   In a close race, he unseated Democrat Wyche Fowler. He was
re-elected in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Although he ascended to a leadership position in the Senate and
maintained a remarkably full schedule, Coverdell had found time in
recent years to relax a bit, friends say. He developed a passion
for gardening, and his recent Christmas cards included a picture of
his flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My greatest regret for him is that he didn't have the time
that he deserved to enjoy himself more,'' Howard said. ``I feel a
real sense of loss. He was a great, great man.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hardly anyone in Congress is interested in who owns
the gas and electric lines on military bases.
</P>
<P>
   But one influential politician is paying close attention to the
question. He is Rep. Joel Hefley, R-Colo., and this is important
for two reasons.
</P>
<P>
   First, the city-owned utility in his hometown, Colorado Springs,
wants to overturn a new Pentagon policy that requires the armed
forces to seek competitive bids from private operators to run the
electricity, gas, water and sewer services on their bases.
</P>
<P>
   Second, because he is chairman of the House Armed Services
Subcommittee on Military Installations and Facilities, Hefley was
able to insert a tiny provision in a mammoth Defense Department
bill, passed by the House in May, that the Pentagon believes would
have the effect of thwarting its policy.
</P>
<P>
   If the measure becomes law, said Randall Yim, deputy
undersecretary of defense for installations, it will force the
military over the next few years to spend large amounts of money to
bring its utilities up to standard, money that he said could be
better spent on pressing national defense needs.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed its version of the defense bill on Thursday
without the Hefley provision, so the matter will have to be
resolved by a House-Senate conference committee.
</P>
<P>
   The word in Congress is that Hefley will have a distinct
advantage in the negotiations. This is what in legislative jargon
is called a member's issue, a senior staff member explained. In
other words, Hefley cares a great deal about the matter. No one
with similar authority in the Senate has the same degree of
interest. So there is an excellent chance Hefley will prevail.
</P>
<P>
   The issue arose because at bases across the country, the water
pipes are crumbling, the electrical wiring does not meet safety
codes, gas lines are prone to leaks, and the sewers tend to back
up. The cost of upgrading these systems, which are owned by the
armed forces, is far beyond what the Pentagon has ever had the
nerve to request or Congress has been willing to provide.
</P>
<P>
   So three years ago, the Defense Department proposed and Congress
quickly adopted a new policy under which the utilities on military
bases would be turned over to private contractors.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was that companies would bid against one another for
contracts to improve the pipes and poles and pumps and wiring. In
return, the government would pay the companies an annual fee to
provide utility services under a long-term arrangement. This seemed
to be an especially appealing prospect to a Republican Congress
committed to competitive private business and smaller government.
</P>
<P>
   Some large companies, notably Enron Corp., based in Houston,
quickly began to seek the business of running utilities on military
bases. More than 100 bases have put their utilities out for bid,
and about a dozen contracts have been awarded.
</P>
<P>
   Enron won a $26 million contract to serve Fort Hamilton, the
Brooklyn, N.Y., Army base, for the next 10 years. In return, Enron
agreed to spend $11 million over the next year upgrading the base's
electric, gas, water and drainage systems.
</P>
<P>
   But soon after the new policy was enacted, many local utility
companies, which are heavily regulated by the states, began to
complain that the Pentagon policy treated them unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   Some argued that state laws gave them the sole right to run the
utilities in their area of jurisdiction once the military
relinquished ownership. Others maintained that state regulations
limited their services _ preventing, for example, the electric
company from providing gas _ and said this put them at a
disadvantage in bidding against an unregulated company like Enron.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado Springs Utilities, a city-owned, state-regulated
company, holds that it has the sole authority under state law to
provide gas, water and electricity at Fort Carson, Peterson Air
Force Base and the U.S. Air Force Academy.
</P>
<P>
   When Fort Carson, a large Army base, sought bids on its utility
services last year, Colorado Springs Utilities filed a lawsuit
maintaining that state law gave it a monopoly in the area. The
government responded that federal law was dominant on federal
property. The suit is pending in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The section Hefley inserted into the defense bill would require
all utility contracts to comply with state laws and regulations, a
requirement that critics said would stifle competition. The overall
bill is so large, authorizing more than $300 billion in Pentagon
programs, that little notice was taken of Hefley's provision.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to see how a compromise can be reached that will
satisfy the Pentagon, regulated utility companies like the one in
Colorado Springs and private competitors like Enron.
</P>
<P>
   Hefley said in an interview that he would work in the conference
committee to find language acceptable to all sides. ``I've always
believed in privatization and open bidding,'' Hefley said. ``It was
certainly not my intention to gut that.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Colorado Springs Utilities, Hefley said he was not out to
protect his local company from competition. But he added, ``It
would seem to me they are in the best position of all to make the
best bid.''

<P>
   TYRE, Lebanon _ Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim guerrillas who
forced Israel from the slice of southern Lebanon it had occupied
for 22 years, grew from a small band of amateurish gunmen to a
highly sophisticated tactical operation savvy enough to exploit a
new weapon of modern warfare _ television.
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of media as a weapon had an effect parallel to a
battle,'' the top Hezbollah commander in southern Lebanon, Sheik
Nabil Quok, said in a rare interview with a Western journalist in
which he discussed not only how Hezbollah learned to improve its
effectiveness, strategy and weaponry, but also to videotape its
successes for distribution to the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the use of these films, we were able to control from a long
distance the morale of a lot of Israelis,'' he said, underscoring
how demoralization as much as defeat helped to drive the Israelis
from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   From once relying on teenage suicide bombers to crash cars into
Israeli installations in the mid-1980s, Hezbollah tactics _
primarily ambushes, assassinations and roadside bombs _ became
increasingly well planned and executed, military observers in the
region say.
</P>
<P>
   A turning point came three years ago this month with the ambush
of a raid by elite Israeli naval commandos in which a dozen were
killed. The Israelis halted such raids for more than a year, trying
to find out what went wrong, and then Hezbollah put out word that
it had penetrated Israeli intelligence, the sheik and Western
military observers said, further halting Israeli counterinsurgency
operations. The effect was to drive the Israelis into bunkers,
conceding land and initiative to Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of these strikes was amplified by the fact that they
were videotaped by hidden Hezbollah cameramen, and that the footage
quickly found its way onto Israeli television, sometimes even as
the Israeli Defense Forces spokesman denied the incident had taken
place.
</P>
<P>
   The effect was what the military calls a ``force multiplier,''
greatly undermining Israeli will.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventy-five percent of Hezbollah's war was the videotapes,''
said an experienced official with the U.N. peacekeeping troops in
the area.
</P>
<P>
   After first being screened on Hezbollah's own television
station, the videotapes were rushed to Beirut, where copies were
delivered to Lebanese Television and Western wire services like The
Associated Press and Reuters, which made them widely available.
</P>
<P>
   The videos were often shown on the nightly television news in
Israel, helping bring home the cost of the occupation. They were a
stark contrast to the standard fare served up by Israeli military
reporters, whose coverage was severely restricted and censored by
the army. Blurred and grainy as they sometimes were, the Hezbollah
videos contributed to the rising public pressure in Israel to bring
the troops home.
</P>
<P>
   But the tape would not have been taken at all without the
improved intelligence gathering and combat skills Hezbollah
developed over the years. ``When they first started, they thought
they could do it with a bunch of people on a hill yelling `Allahu
akbar,' a U.N. official in the area said of the Hezbollah fighters.
``They would loose 40 in an operation. Now they are very
sophisticated, very disciplined.''
</P>
<P>
   Quok said the guerrillas were able to improve their
effectiveness by studying each operation, learning from their
mistakes, and developing new uses for weaponry. He also outlined
the guerrillas' reliance on sometimes stunningly low-tech methods
to thwart Israel's more numerous and more sophisticated forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resistance always focused on the weak points of the
enemy,'' he said as he outlined a classic theory and practice of
guerrilla warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Military experts say that at any one time Hezbollah maintained
only about 500 full-time fighters, although it could mobilize many
more supporters. The Israeli troops in southern Lebanon usually
numbered about 1,500, backed up by some 2,500 more troops in their
proxy militia, which collapsed and fled when the Israelis abruptly
pulled out of Southern Lebanon on May 24.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah officials say they lost some 1,200 fighters over the
years, and yellow roadside markers are being put up at the spots
where they fell. Hundreds of Israeli soldiers were killed.
</P>
<P>
   There were two kinds of wars, Quok said, guerrilla war and
conventional war. By alternating tactics between the two, he went
on, Hezbollah was able to maintain the initiative and, after a
clash, melt away into a largely sympathetic populace.
</P>
<P>
   ``By limiting the firing, we were able to keep the cards in our
hands,'' the sheik said. ``We were able to do small, little battles
where we had the advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the rockets the resistance used had to be used
intelligently,'' he added. ``We would do an action only in the time
and place where it had an impact.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The sheik and other military experts cited a number of Hezbollah
innovations. These ranged from roadside bombs made of fake plastic
rocks, which could be bought in Beirut garden stores for $15, to
running farm animals across areas monitored by Israeli motion
sensors. At the same time, Hezbollah had the ability to jam Israeli
radar and closed-circuit television monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was never driven and did not show up on Israeli heat
sensors, an old Soviet T-55 tank hidden in a cave and firing
sporadically took the Israelis months to find, the sheik said.
Hezbollah fighters discovered that remote-controlled anti-tank
rockets, which can, in effect, be steered in flight, could be
directed into small openings in concrete bunkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the man who invented these rockets did not know this,''
Quok bragged.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, he said, he and his fighters, ``were always ready for
martyrdom,'' but the Israeli soldier ``probably wasn't ready to die
for this.
</P>
<P>
   ``More important than everything,'' he said, ``is that the
Israeli soldier didn't believe in the war.''
</P>
<P>
   He also stressed the importance of a good intelligence network.
The effectiveness of that network was demonstrated with the
assassination on Feb. 28 last year of Brig. Gen. Eretz Gerstien,
the top Israeli army liaison officer to the South Lebanese Army, by
a roadside bomb as his car passed in a military convoy. He was the
highest ranking Israeli officer killed during the occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, on Jan. 30, the second-ranking commander of the South
Lebanese Army, Col. Akl Hashem, was killed by a bomb at his house
in Marjyoun, a mainly Christian center. His death was the first in
a series of attacks early this year that left seven Israeli
soldiers dead and helped set the Israelis on a course for an early
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the incidents on Feb. 6, an Israeli medic was killed
as he tended wounded comrades. That particularly gory videotape was
shown over and over the next day on Israeli television.

QUESTIONS RAISED BY HOUSE PANEL ABOUT GORE REMARK AT FUND-RAISER 
</HEADLINE>
   By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Dan Burton urged Justice Department lawyers on
Tuesday to question Vice President Al Gore about a remark that he
makes on a videotape of a White House coffee in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The videotape is sensitive because it features both President
Clinton and Gore and contains two references to James Riady, an
Indonesian businessman who did not attend the coffee but whose
large contributions to the Democratic Party are the subject of a
federal investigation of campaign finance abuses.
</P>
<P>
   On the tape of the event, which took place on Dec. 15, 1995, in
the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Gore addresses Arief
Wiriadinata, an Indonesian gardener who illegally contributed
$455,000 to the Democratic Party earlier that year. The vice
president apparently mentions Riady.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is heard telling Wiriadinata that political issue
television advertisements, paid for by large contributors to the
Democratic Party, should be shown to Riady, Burton's investigators
said. Riady had not contributed any money to the Democrats in
either 1995 or 1996.
</P>
<P>
   On the tape, according to Burton, the vice president is heard
saying, ``We ought to, we ought to, we ought to show Riady the
tapes, some of the ad tapes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is not seen on the tape saying those words, but Burton and
committee staff lawyers have concluded that it is the vice
president's voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the vice president's apparent location in the room, and
the apparent location of Wiriadinata, it is a reasonable assumption
that Vice President Gore was making this suggestion to
Wiriadinata,'' Burton wrote in a five-page letter to Attorney
General Janet Reno on Tuesday. ``It would indeed be extraordinary
for the vice president to suggest showing political issue
advertisements to an Indonesian billionaire who lives in Jakarta,
Indonesia.''
</P>
<P>
   During the same coffee, Wiriadinata tells President Clinton,
``James Riady sent me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kennedy, a spokesman for Gore, said, ``Wait until Dan Burton
finds out that when you play the tape backwards it says, `Paul is
dead.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Burton, R-Ind., is the chairman of the House Committee on
Government Reform, which has investigated campaign finance abuses
since 1997 and has had the videotape since late that year. It was
unclear why the committee is pursuing the issue of Gore's comment
now, but Burton intends to ask several witnesses about the matter
at a hearing scheduled for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the committee's investigators subpoenaed the original
coffee videotape from the White House and reviewed it on Monday at
the FBI laboratory in Quantico, Va., to ensure the accuracy of
Gore's words. Committee investigators say the vice president's
remark raises a question about what he may have known about any
relationship between Wiriadinata and Riady.
</P>
<P>
   The committee referred the videotape to the Justice Department
last December, but Gore was not asked about it during his interview
with federal investigators last April 19 or in four previous
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Burton said on Tuesday that this raised further questions about
the aggressiveness of the department's campaign finance inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a minimum, it is deeply disturbing that the Justice
Department has failed to take this piece of potential evidence
seriously,'' Burton wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Tuesday, James C. Wilson, the committee's
chief counsel, said: ``It would have been easy for the Justice
Department to have followed up on this information last year. I
don't understand why the attorney general failed to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiriadinata's contributions to the Democratic Party, totaling
$455,000, made headlines in late 1996 after it was reported that he
had little income working as a gardener in northern Virginia. His
father-in-law was a partner of Riady at the Lippo Group, the Riady
family conglomerate. The Democratic National Committee returned
Wiriadinata's contributions in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Wiriadinata is believed to be living in Indonesia, and has not
responded to the Burton committee's efforts to interview him.
</P>
<P>
   A White House official said that, after listening to the tape,
aides to Gore were not convinced that Riady's name was used by the
vice president. ``People say the V.P. is using a two-syllable name,
like Dotty or Godfrey, and not a five-syllable phrase like Riady,''
the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the official suggested more definitively that Gore had
used the name ``Godfrey'' during the remark. A Houston lawyer, Lee
Godfrey, had attended the same coffee.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Gore told investigators that he had seen Riady only
``twice in my life.'' The first time was during a trip to Malaysia,
and the second time was ``when he was in Betty Currie's office
preparing to go in to see the president with a couple of other
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton wrote in his letter, ``The vice president does not
describe the type of relationship with Riady that would lead him to
suggest a private screening of political advertisements in Jakarta,
Indonesia.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggests seven questions for Reno's investigators to ask Gore
about the incident. One of them is: ``If the vice president made a
suggestion about showing tapes to Riady, what did he know about
Riady that would lead him to make this suggestion in the presence
of Wiriadinata?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are interested,'' Burton writes in the conclusion of
his letter to Reno, ``the Committee on Government Reform has the
original Beta tape, and I would be willing to make arrangements to
furnish this evidence to you.''

MARKET PLACE: SEC TO STUDY PAYMENT FOR ORDER FLOW IN STOCK
OPTIONS

<P>
   Competition has come to the market for traded stock options, and
the customers may not be the winners.
</P>
<P>
   The four exchanges that trade stock options in this country
became more aggressive last fall in seeking to trade options that
had formerly been dominated by one exchange.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of that move, Arthur Levitt, the chairman of
the Securities and Exchange Commission, exulted that competition
was narrowing the spread between bid and asked prices for listed
options.
</P>
<P>
   ``In four of the five actively traded options we examined,
effective spreads have fallen between 22 and 44 percent since these
options went from single exchange trading to multiple listings,''
Levitt said in a speech last September.
</P>
<P>
   But those declines were temporary. Since then, competition for
options business has grown ever more steep _ but the competition
has taken the form of paying brokers for order flow. Spreads appear
to have widened, albeit not back to the previous levels. Wednesday
the SEC will announce a new study aimed at determining whether
payment for order flow is causing problems.
</P>
<P>
   For several months, the SEC has sat by as the payment for order
flow has intensified, to the irritation of many in the industry.
Some who are paying for order flow are furious that the SEC is not
stopping others from doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are all saying, `We abhor this practice, and we wouldn't
do it if the SEC would just stop us,''' said one SEC staffer in
exasperation.
</P>
<P>
   Payment for order flow, long a practice in the stock market,
provides a way for brokerage firms to profit from sending their
orders to a particular place to be executed. Most of the electronic
brokerage firms now collect such payments in the options markets,
and other brokerage firms are beginning to look at getting such
payments.
</P>
<P>
   There were no such payments in the options market until last
fall in large part because there was little real competition in
that market. Even when options were listed on more than one
exchange, virtually all the business tended to be on one market.
Orders went where there was liquidity, which was where the orders
already were.
</P>
<P>
   That began to change last fall. The International Stock
Exchange, a new exchange, announced plans to begin trading many
options. (It did so in May, but so far has not had a very large
impact.) In addition, the Justice Department antitrust division
began showing interest in the options market. In short order, the
existing exchanges began to show more interest in competition.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom then was that the Chicago Board Options
Exchange, the leading market, would destroy the competition. In
fact, it has lost market share, in large part because a number of
specialist firms, which have operations on a number of exchanges,
began to offer to pay for order flow.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, the first to pay for order flow appears to have
been Susquehanna Partners, which had taken responsibility for
Microsoft options at the Chicago exchange. Microsoft options had
been dominated by the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange. Those payments
began last fall, and enabled Chicago to gain substantial market
share in those options.
</P>
<P>
   When Susquehanna began paying for order flow, it captured the
attention of other exchanges. Soon other exchanges began offering
major market makers, like Spear, Leeds &AMP; Kellogg and Knight, as
well as Susquehanna, the right to be the specialist on their
exchanges in options that had not previously been traded on those
exchanges. Some of those market makers were paying for order flow,
and they brought in business. At exchanges, the specialists are the
major players in any given option, but other local market makers
also participate in the trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``People thought multiple listing of options would be the death
knell for us,'' said Meyer Frucher, the chairman of the
Philadelphia Stock Exchange, on Tuesday. ``But it has proved to be
the salvation.'' Frucher said he came to realize that in the
changing options market it would be the specialist that would
become the brand name, not the options exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Brokerage firms that do business with Susquehanna route orders
to it to be traded at whichever market Susquehanna is the
specialist. It is a specialist in about 600 stocks, doing business
at all four markets. Susquehanna officials declined to speak on the
record about their business.
</P>
<P>
   As Chicago saw its market share begin to wither, it looked for
ways to get some of it back. On July 6, it stunned competitors with
its own plan. All market makers on the Chicago floor, whether the
specialists or those in the crowd, will pay a fee of 40 cents per
options contract, or 0.4 cents a share of stock covered by an
option contract. That fee will go to the exchange, which will give
it to specialists to use for marketing purposes, whether paying for
order flow or putting out glossy brochures.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to that, the CBOE had been among the harshest critics of
payment for order flow. But, said Edward J. Joyce, the exchange's
president, it had no choice. ``If payment for order flow is going
to be a factor, then we are going to compete on that front as
well,'' he said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago exchange was at a competitive disadvantage because
many of its specialists are local firms that handle relatively few
stocks and thus are less able to make deals with brokerage firms
that do not want to make dozens of deals to route order flow in
various stocks.
</P>
<P>
   To the amazement of other exchanges, the SEC allowed that
proposal to go into effect immediately, rather than suspending it
while seeking comment for 60 days. To the SEC, it appears to have
been a case of letting Chicago join the competition. To the other
exchanges, it amounted to a new and dangerous type of competition _
one that involves the exchange itself collecting the marketing fees
and that gets payments not just from the specialist but from all
market makers operating in a stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Purchase of order flow by an exchange is an untested concept
with uncertain ramifications,'' wrote Lanny A. Schwartz, the
Philadelphia exchange's general counsel, in a letter to the SEC.
``The commission should carefully consider all aspects of the
proposal before permitting its implementation.''
</P>
<P>
   Untested concept or not, Philadelphia announced last week that
it would mimic the Chicago plan, but would pay $1 a contract, or
two and a half times as much.

INDICTED EX-PRESIDENT OF ECUADOR DEFENDS ACTS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Deposed Ecuadorean President Jamil Mahuad, who faces
arrest warrants issued last week by his nation's top court,
defended Tuesday the decisions that sparked the charges against
him.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released by Harvard University, where he has been
teaching, Mahuad said that a three-member team of lawyers will
represent him in upcoming proceedings before Ecuador's Supreme
Court, but did not indicate whether he would return to face the
charges himself. He said would make no further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Mahuad said the decisions cited by the court were necessary to
stabilize a national banking and finance system that was rapidly
collapsing.
</P>
<P>
   Mahuad, who was ousted by Ecuador's military in January, became
a visiting fellow at Harvard University's Kennedy School of
Government in April and will remain at the school through the
summer working on projects that neither he nor the school has
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ecuador was facing its worst crisis in the last 70 years,'' he
said in the prepared statement. ``It had become the most indebted
country in Latin America in regard to its GDP (gross domestic
product). It had the worst inflation in South America. . . . The
financial system was broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a consequence of these problems, capital flight took $500
million out of the country in three months,'' he said, and for that
reason the government decided to freeze broad areas of the banking
sector ``to stop the bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics and the supreme court judge leading the investigation
allege that Mahuad exceeded his constitutional authority and
possibly engaged in corrupt behavior by helping banking-sector
leaders, but the former president said ``all our actions were in
good faith.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I affected the lives of many people with these
decisions,'' he said, ``but my main goal was to prevent the wealthy
people from taking money out of the country. Of course I made
mistakes, but it was very difficult to govern during such a
crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   The monetary crisis and his decision to freeze deposits were
subjects of a study group on Ecuador which he led at the Kennedy
School.

<P>
   PIONEER, Calif. _ It has been a long, long time since water
cascading from the Sierra Nevada here flowed through its riverbed
in anything like the way that nature intended.
</P>
<P>
   Here, as across California, the route is determined by a network
of elaborate plumbing: an extraordinary system of tunnels, canals,
pipes, dams and reservoirs, all built decades ago by the Pacific
Gas &AMP; Electric Co. in order to transform billions of gallons of
water into staggering amounts of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in one of the most ambitious plans ever under electrical
deregulation, every piece of California's system of 174 dams, 99
reservoirs, 68 power plants, 380 miles of artificial waterways and
hundreds of thousands of acres of land could be auctioned off by
sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
   The transfer would be the biggest of its kind, and, while
details are still being worked out by state regulators, has raised
concerns about how the need for providing electrical power would be
balanced against the need to protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
   California is one of a handful of states that has taken the lead
in deregulating utilities, as state lawmakers have moved to
separate the generation of power from its distribution. But
California, with its wealth of hydropower, must confront another
issue: how to keep a hand in the fate of the largest hydroelectric
system in the world after it has been broken into pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the worst thing that could happen would be the kind of
fragmentation that could result if these assets were sold off to
new owners,'' said Doug Wheeler, who was, until last year,
California's secretary of natural resources, and whose comments
reflected a sense of apprehension about the potential environmental
consequences of the planned transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, California's electric utilities have fallen under the
scrutiny of a state watchdog whose muscle to press for good conduct
is backed up a carrot: the authority to impose or withhold rate
increases.
</P>
<P>
   But under the deregulation plan _ intended to drive down
electricity rates, and approved by the California Legislature in a
unanimous vote _ all power generated in the state is supposed to be
opened to competition by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   That will relegate existing utilities to the role of mere
providers, while allowing the new owners of power generation to set
prices freely, without the oversight that has for long been built
into the system.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Gas and the state's other utilities have already sold
most of their conventional generating plants, to companies like
Duke Power and Enron Corp. But what is being debated now is
whether, when it comes to hydropower, the free market is really the
right recipe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Californians have been given a chance to decide how this
system will be managed and, in turn, how our rivers will be cared
for,'' said Thomas J. Graff, the Western regional director of
Environmental Defense, a private advocacy group, and a leader in
campaign by environmentalists and outdoorsmen to subject any
transfer to strict environmental conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this chance will evaporate like a pool of water in the hot
summer sun if we let it,'' Graff said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, about 40 percent of the nation's 96,000
megawatts of hydropower capacity is in private hands. Most of that
still falls under state regulation, but as other hydropower-rich
states like Oregon have begun to follow California toward the free
market, corporate executives and government officials have been
watching to see which way California turns at what could be a
critical juncture.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Indeed, a plan submitted on Tuesday by two U.S. senators would
seek to accelerate the deregulation process. A bill by the
senators, Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Phil Gramm, R- Texas, would
require all states to deregulate their electric power monopolies by
2002.
</P>
<P>
   By federal law, the conditions under which dams operate are
supposed to be set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,
whose 30-year licenses spell out such details as how much of a
river's water must remain in its natural bed.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, though, the federal relicensing process has been
slow and so often delayed that it has kindled considerable
mistrust.
</P>
<P>
   In the most extreme example, the license for the dams on the
Mokelumne, which fuel the Pacific Gas hydropower plants near
Pioneer, expired in 1975, and has been renewed on a one-year basis
ever since, without modification, even as environmental concerns
have grown more intense.
</P>
<P>
   To fly over the remote, rugged canyons of the Sierra of Northern
and Central California is to see the extent to which the appetite
for the power delivered by Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric has transformed
the waterways.
</P>
<P>
   From Bakersfield in the south to near the Oregon border, the
hydropower system stretches for more than 300 miles. All along the
way, beneath soaring peaks and snowy meadows, streams and rivers
can be seen empty or diminished across long sections in which their
flow has been diverted into canals, tunnels and turbines.
</P>
<P>
   Among those blocked or drained, some of which date from the
early part of the 20th century, include portions of the Feather,
Yuba, American, Kern, Stanislaus, San Joaquin and the Eel, as well
as the Mokelumne, where in the summer as is typical _ as many as 19
gallons in 20 is channeled away from the riverbed.
</P>
<P>
   What is at stake, according to a 1996 report by a team of
scientists convened by the U.S. Forest Service, are rivers and
streamside areas ``the most altered and impaired habitats of the
Sierra.'' The report said that dams were principally at fault.
</P>
<P>
   Among the major casualties have been populations of migratory
fish like the salmon and steelhead, prevented by dams from
returning to their river spawning grounds, and resident varieties
like the trout, no longer able to thrive in rivers like the
Mokelumne and the Feather, because of dams and inadequate water
flows.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the river's natural course, the waters travel along
what amount to giant staircases, channeled almost horizontally
under mountains, through Ponderosa pine forests and along steep
granite cliffs before being sent plunging downward in a rush, in
order to turn the turbines that generate power.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, the Pacific Gas system generates some 3,800
megawatts of power per hour, or enough to light 4 million homes,
and estimates of its value have soared as high as $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In maneuvering leading up to the potential transfer, the
utility's parent corporation, PG&AMP;E Corp., has said that it would be
willing to spend as much as $175 million to improve the hydropower
system's environmental performance, in large part by reducing power
generation and increasing the flow of water through streambeds.
</P>
<P>
   But that offer was contingent on a deal that would allow PG&AMP;E
Corp. to buy the assets itself, bypassing the kind of public
bidding seen as most likely to bring ratepayers the highest return.
So far, PG&AMP;E has been unable to win approval for such a guarantee,
and it has said that unless it can do so, it sees no alternative
but to proceed with the auction, which it says might leave the
state, with limited legal powers, unable to force any kind of
environmental repair.
</P>
<P>
   No conditions have been set as to who might be deemed an
acceptable bidder. But if there were a selloff of dams, the
transfer would have to be approved by federal regulators, whose
main task would be to determine if the new buyer possessed the
resources necessary to operate the acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Any decision on how to proceed with a sale is now in the hands
of the state's Public Utilities Commission, which has spent the
last several months conducting hearings. The commission has ordered
a report, due in September, to examine the potential environmental
impact of any handover.
</P>
<P>
   In the Legislature, one leading Democrat, Fred Keeley, has
introduced a bill that would postpone the process, by authorizing
the state to purchase the utility's land and other assets and
retain them for up to six years while deciding whether to transfer
individual parcels to public agencies or to sell them to private
bidders.
</P>
<P>
   As one potential model for the kind of agreement that might be
built into any sale, some advocates point to an accord struck last
summer between the PG&AMP;E Corp. and state and federal agencies to
share the $50 million cost of removing five small hydropower dams
on Battle Creek, a tributary of the Trinity River.
</P>
<P>
   Those dams had been widely recognized as an impediment to salmon
and steelhead populations, and the announcement of the deal was
made jointly by the utility, Gov. Gray Davis of California, and
U.S. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt.
</P>
<P>
   Even if no other dams are to be razed, groups like Environmental
Defense have said that any transfer of ownership should be prefaced
at least by a deal that would restore water flows by a factor of 10
or 20 in rivers like the Mokelumne, in order to help restore fish
habitats.
</P>
<P>
   A report issued by the organization in California this week
estimated that such a move would result in only a 10 percent to 20
percent decrease in hydropower generation.
</P>
<P>
   Graff, the regional director, said the price tag for an
acceptable package of environmental repair would be about $400
million.
</P>
<P>
   At their San Francisco headquarters, PG&AMP;E Corp. officials said
they were preparing a proposal that they said would balance the
need for power generation and environmental protection on
condition, again, that the dams and other assets remain in the
hands of the parent company.
</P>
<P>
   They also warned that it would be foolhardy to move too
drastically to reign in hydropower, particularly now, at a time
when surging demand has been testing California's capacity to
generate electricity, and when alternative means of power
generation carry environmental consequences of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all comes down to the fact that the state needs electric
power, and this is a clean way to provide it,'' said Jon Tremayne,
a Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric spokesman.

MICROSOFT EARNINGS EXCEED EXPECTATIONS, DRIVEN BY 10 PERCENT RISE
IN PROFIT 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE LOHR      
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. slightly beat Wall Street's expectations Tuesday
as its quarterly profits rose 10 percent, even though revenues were
flat.
</P>
<P>
   The leading software company got its biggest lift in the quarter
from a surge in the income from its swelling portfolio of cash and
equity investments. Microsoft executives cautioned that investment
income should drop in the current quarter. But they then delivered
an optimistic outlook for the current fiscal year, which begins
this month, saying the company expects revenues to rise 15 percent
over the next year with earnings rising roughly 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel very, very good entering the next fiscal year,'' said
John Connors, the chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterly results, according to analysts, suggest that
Microsoft seems to be skillfully handling the uncertainties it
faces in its business and on the legal front. It is in the midst of
a transition in its product markets as its new Windows 2000
operating system is adopted gradually by corporate customers, at a
time when the business market for computers has been sluggish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a slow but steady transitionary quarter from Microsoft
sprinkled with some optimism for the future,'' said Richard
Sherlund, an analyst at Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has also just begun a longer-term shift in strategy as
more and more of its business will come from selling software as
Internet services _ an initiative the company announced last month,
called Microsoft.Net. That effort, analysts note, will require
significant investments by the company, though it will not yield
substantial revenues for at least another year.
</P>
<P>
   During a conference call with analysts Tuesday, Connors referred
only obliquely to the federal court ruling in April that Microsoft
was a monopolist that had repeatedly violated the nation's
antitrust laws. In listing the challenges the company had tackled
during the quarter, he mentioned the ``unprecedented level of news
on the legal front.''
</P>
<P>
   All sanctions against Microsoft _ including an order to split
the company in two _ have been stayed pending appeals, which could
take a year or more.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of the uncertainties raised by the antitrust
case, Microsoft stock fell by nearly 50 percent in the first five
months of this year, from a 52-week high of $119.09375 on Dec. 30
to $60.375 on May 26. Tuesday it closed at $78.50, up 31.25 cents.
The earnings announcement came after the market had closed.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter, Microsoft earnings rose nearly 10 percent to
$2.4 billion, or 44 cents a share. The consensus per-share estimate
among 24 analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial, was 42
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   In the comparable quarter a year earlier, Microsoft reported
earnings of $2.2 billion, or 40 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's revenues for the most recent quarter were in line
with analysts' expectations at $5.80 billion, though up a mere $40
million from the year-earlier quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft continues to garner an increasing share of its
quarterly profits from gains on its sizable investment portfolio
rather than from current operations. In the June quarter, the
company reported investment income of more than $1.1 billion, or 31
percent of its pretax profits. In the year-ago quarter, Microsoft's
investment income added $485 million to its pretax income,
representing 14 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Microsoft pretax income from operations actually
declined in the most recent quarter to $2.5 billion, compared with
$2.9 billion in the quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Connors said that the company's investment income will be
somewhat cyclical and that its contribution in the next quarter
will likely be ``significantly lower'' than in the June quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he told analysts, ``you should expect investment income
from Microsoft'' in the future generally.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the explanation is that Microsoft's business is a money
machine that piles up cash far faster than the company spends it.
And the added money in the company coffers earns dividends. At the
end of June, cash and marketable securities reached $23.8 billion,
up from $17.2 billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Microsoft has a $17.8 billion portfolio of equity
investments in technology companies, which are typically business
partners of Microsoft. In fiscal 2000 alone, Microsoft made 100
such investments totaling $5.4 billion. If those companies are
acquired, for example, Microsoft must sell its stake and report the
gain as portfolio income.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have been closely following the quarterly results for
signs of how Windows 2000, the new operating system introduced
earlier this year, is selling. Windows 2000 refers both to a new
version of Microsoft's desktop operating system for corporations
and new server software for running corporate networks and Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Connors declined to give much detail on Windows 2000 sales,
beyond saying the company is ``quite satisfied'' with early
deployments in big companies including General Motors, Royal
Dutch/Shell, Xerox and Motorola. Last month, the Defense Department
announced that Windows 2000 would be the technology platform for
its ``integrated warfare system'' on the Navy's next generation of
aircraft carriers, the CVN-77, known as the ``smart carrier.''
</P>
<P>
   The consumer market is carrying the personal computer market,
Connors noted, with year-to-year growth of roughly 15 percent.
Business demand is still sluggish in part because of the falloff in
spending following the widely anticipated Year 2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts expect the September quarter, a traditionally slow
one for business purchases, to not be particularly significant as a
sign of whether corporate demand is picking up or how well Windows
2000 is doing. ``It looks like we'll have to wait until the
December quarter to get a really solid reading on where things
stand,'' said Sherlund of Goldman Sachs.

SENATE BILL ON CHINA TRADE FACES DELAY, LOTT PREDICTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate is unlikely to vote on a bill to grant
permanent normal trade relations to China before Congress adjourns
next week, meaning the vote would be delayed at least until
September, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very hard to get a final vote on PNTR before the
recess, if all of the options available to those that oppose the
bill exercised them, because there are several points where delay
could occur, filibusters could occur,'' Lott said, using the
shorthand for the trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   But Lott said senators still might begin debating the measure as
early as next Wednesday and wrap up when the Senate returned after
Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   Lott downplayed warnings by critics who say that delaying a
final vote is risky and insisted that the Senate would eventually
approve the trade measure by an overwhelming margin. The House
passed the measure, 237 to 197, on May 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe delay is dangerous, and certainly not fatal,''
Lott told reporters. ``The overwhelming majority of the Senate is
for China PNTR. The headline is going to read, sometime here in the
next month: `Senate Passes China Trade Bill.' And I don't think
there's going to be any significant change or any way to stop
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders, who are traditional Republican allies, have
been critical of Lott for putting one of their top legislative
priorities in jeopardy. They fear that postponing the final vote on
the measure could expose it to unforeseen impediments.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, though, the top priority for Senate Republicans has
been to pass two tax-cutting measures and as many of the 13 annual
spending bills to finance the government as possible before the
Republican National Convention, which begins at the end of this
month.
</P>
<P>
   With at least 70 senators prepared to vote for the trade
measure, associates of Lott say that he feels he has the luxury of
using the timing of the vote as leverage to win concessions from
Senate Democrats and the White House on the spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the delay has been that supporters are trying
to pass a clean version of the House bill. If any amendments are
tacked on in the Senate, the whole measure would have to return to
the House for a second and potentially volatile vote.
</P>
<P>
   Senate and administration aides have worked fruitlessly over the
last week to work out a compromise on a measure offered sponsored
by Senators Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.) and Robert G. Torricelli
(D-N.J.).
</P>
<P>
   Their measure would require the administration to monitor
China's record on the spread of nuclear weapons. It would impose
automatic sanctions on China if there is ``credible evidence'' of
exports of certain types of prohibited weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would have discretion to waive some penalties, but
others would be automatic. The administration and business leaders
have opposed the measure as unnecessary, even after Thompson agreed
to water down several provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Other senators, including Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.) and Jesse
Helms (R-N.C.) have said they want to offer amendments dealing with
China's record on human rights, labor standards and national
security.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Helms opened the first of two days of hearings by the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which he heads, to examine the
trade bill's impact. Helms opposes the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most disturbing are those who want to prevent Congress from
even addressing these national security questions during the PNTR
debate,'' Helms said, ``for fear that it will complicate what
amounts to a single-minded, dollar-driven crusade to make certain
this trade deal is approved in the Senate.''

ADVERTISING AS FARCE ALONGSIDE THE TOUR DE FRANCE 
</HEADLINE>
 (EDS: See also TOUR-DE-FRANCE, moved in ``s'' sports category.) 
 By SAMUEL ABT  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COURCHEVEL, France _ Christophe Benoit is spending three weeks
in July traveling around France on a four-wheel motorcycle inside a
huge pot of a pork-flavored pate. Mohamet, who declines to give any
last name, is making the same journey inside a can of butane gas.
Philippe Chapuis is going sometimes on roller skates, sometimes in
the back of a car in the white doughboy garb of Bibendum, the
Michelin man.
</P>
<P>
   The three, and 600 co-workers, are part of an enormous
advertising convoy that precedes the Tour de France, as the world's
greatest bicycle race takes three weeks to circumnavigate more than
2,200 miles of France and slices of Switzerland and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   All along the way, 40 European companies will spend millions of
dollars for the opportunity to acquaint a huge audience with their
products or, as detractors put it, litter the roads with junk.
There are lots of products: Each of 200 vehicles distributes at
least 5,000 objects a day or 20 million by the end of the race in
Paris on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies distribute many more gifts. ``We give away 20,000
bags a day, or 400,000 by the end of the race,'' said Daniel Isaac,
director of communications for Credit Lyonnais, the big French
bank. ``We've been a partner of the Tour for 20 years,'' he added.
``It's very important for our image.''
</P>
<P>
   The gifts are as varied as the givers. An off-track betting
system, the Pari Mutuel Urbain, distributes oversized green
cardboard hands. One of the country's trade union confederations,
Force Ouvriere, offers a yo-yo.
</P>
<P>
   Michelin and France Telecom give caps to many of the 15 million
spectators watching the race along the roads.
</P>
<P>
   The Champion supermarket chain is pleased to give a guide to
many sports, not including bicycle racing. Cochonou, a sausage
company, offers the obvious, as does Coeur de Lion, a cheese
company, and Haribo, a candy maker. La Redoute, a mail-order
department store chain, supplies shade screens for car windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can give just a piece of paper,'' said Jean-Pierre
Lachaud, who has directed the publicity caravan's operations since
1989. ``But an object of some value with a piece of paper, that's
OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Lachaud works with 10 assistants to run the caravan's
operations, using a radio-equipped plane to make sure the vehicles
are spaced correctly. ``Since 1989, we've made the caravan roll in
staggered formation so that journalists' cars can get through,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   For safety, all objects are supposed to be handed to spectators,
not just dropped on the road. Nevertheless, many samples are flung
at the crowd and wind up in traffic, where young and old often dart
heedlessly to retrieve them. A 12-year-old boy died on Sunday, a
few days after he was hit by a vehicle as the caravan passed; it
was the first such death reported in a dozen years.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicles of the 40 advertisers, up from 36 last year, do not
include 35 more cars and trucks that sell magazines, newspapers and
T-shirts. Few salesmen follow the bicycle race itself, because most
spectators go home once the riders have passed.
</P>
<P>
   The caravan dates to 1930, when the Tour switched from teams
sponsored by companies, mainly bicycle manufacturers, to national
teams. While the teams that were commercially supported paid a fee
to enter, the national teams did not, and Tour de France officials
decided that income had to be increased. When commercially
supported teams were reintroduced in the 1960's, the caravan was
such a big part of the event that it was retained.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the caravan helps entertain and enliven the crowd
when it passes an hour before the riders.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the gifts are very important, just little souvenirs,
but fun,'' said Isabelle Colombeau, a teacher, as she waited for
the caravan recently with her mother, father and brother. Nearby, a
small child cried, having been beaten by an adult to a leaflet from
Cofidis, a telephone credit service.
</P>
<P>
   The Colombeau family was especially pleased with its haul of key
rings from TotalFina Elf, the merged French oil company, and small
pots of rillettes, or pork pate from Bordeau Chesnel, the employer
of Benoit in his oversized mock pot.
</P>
<P>
   Each advertiser is charged a total of 130,000 French francs _
more than $18,000 _ for the first three vehicles and 30,000 francs
for each additional one, according to Florence Maire of the Tour's
marketing department. While most advertisers have three or four
vehicles, the insurer AGF reinforces its cars with a squadron of
young women on motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies employ young women to sit in the backs of open
cars all day, no matter what the weather, and wave to the fans or
swing their arms to the disco beat pulsing from an adjoining
loudspeaker as a young man pitches objects from the front seat.
That amounts to a lot of waving and swinging, since the average
daily stage of the race is 105 miles in four or five hours.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the workers appear to enjoy their jobs. Although their
pay by the advertisers is minimal, they say, they get free room and
board plus a chance to see the country and do a bit of partying
once the caravan is parked for the night.
</P>
<P>
   And, if they stay at it long enough, as Chapuis, the Michelin
man, has done, there is the ultimate honor: A week ago he was
awarded the medal of the Tour de France for 20 years' service and
devotion to the race. The millions at the sides of the many roads
simply thought he was waving at them.

HOUSE APPROVES ANTI-SPAMMING MEASURE 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ E-mail users tired of wading through unsolicited
online advertisements would be able to compel companies to stop
sending the junk mail under legislation the House passed 427-1
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which now goes to the Senate, would permit computer
users to tell the Federal Trade Commission that they do not want to
receive the unwelcome e-mail ads, or ``spam'' in online lingo.
Direct marketers and other advertisers making wide use of the
Internet would be barred from e-mailing ads to any computer user
who has listed his online address with the agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-mail can be a useful advertising tool for business if used
properly and with the consumer's consent,'' said Rep. Gene Green,
D-Texas, the bill's chief sponsor. ``However, Internet users should
be given the opportunity to move out of the fast lane of the
information superhighway to better control the bulk e-mails
streaming across their computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, was the only lawmaker to oppose the
legislation. He objected to the bill's provision that would have
federal law supplant state efforts to control unwanted e-mail
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed Unsolicited Electronic Mail Act seeks to discourage
companies from sending unwanted ads by requiring them to include
their return e-mail address. Inclusion of the return address would
make it easier for recipients to reply and tell the companies to
stop sending ads, Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that fail to comply with the computer user's wishes
would be subject to a trade commission order to stop sending
advertisements. Defiance of the agency could leave the advertisers
subject to a court order that they stop.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that then fail to obey the order could be held in
contempt and fined, at the court's discretion.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney who represents direct marketers criticized what he
called ill-advised legislation that could hamper the ``free and
fair exchange'' of ideas on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would add another layer of complexity for an evolving
industry and hamper the ability of companies to get their messages
to consumers,`` said Andrew Lustigman of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Green, however, said the bill would not unduly interfere with
the right of companies to advertise.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the right to speak,'' he said, but they ``don't have
the right to make people listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the measure, the trade commission would be permitted to
charge computer users an as-yet-determined fee to defray the
agency's cost of compiling and maintaining the list and making it
available to companies.
</P>
<P>
   Internet providers would be able to sue for up to $25,000 those
online advertisers that fail to comply with a customer's request
not to receive their e-mail. Courts could increase the amount of
damages if they conclude that the companies ``willfully or
knowingly'' defied the request.

 &HT;    Judge: Museum can keep Mickey Mouse art, for now
 &HT;    By Bill Douthat
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH _Mickey Mouse will be hanging around Boca
Raton's International Museum of Cartoon Art for awhile longer.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit Judge Walter Colbath ruled Tuesday that, while a bank
can take possession of the earliest-known drawings of the famous
rodent in a mortgage foreclosure, there is no need for a
lickety-split seizure. With the extra time, the museum may be able
to keep one of its most-prized possessions.
</P>
<P>
   Colbath set a Aug. 1 hearing to allow the museum and SunTrust
Bank to recommend how the fragile, pencil drawings would be removed
from the museum in Mizner Park. Sometime after the hearing, the
judge will decide how the move would take place.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's exactly what we were hoping,'' said Nancy Colman, an
attorney for the museum, who asked for a three- to four-week delay
in the seizure of the drawings in a hearing last week. Colman said
the museum should be given enough time to refinance the mortgage,
allowing them to keep the drawings.
</P>
<P>
   SunTrust Bank wants the drawings because the museum is $170,000
in arrears on payments. The museum owes $1.1 million on a $3
million mortgage it took out in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The 36 drawings, valued by the museum at $3.2 to $3.7 million,
were pledged as collateral for the loan. The drawings were created
in 1927 for the animated film ``Plane Crazy,'' the first film
featuring Mickey Mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Beetle Bailey cartoonist Mort Walker, the museum's founder and
chairman, has called the drawings the museum's ``Mona Lisa.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker's wife, Catherine, said Tuesday that the judge's order
gives the museum some breathing room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand that (the judge) ruled for the bank, but
truthfully, we are very pleased that they are not going to be taken
out of the museum right now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At last week's hearing, museum curator Stephen Charla said the
drawings are historic artifacts and should not be moved without
great care.
</P>
<P>
   Museum employees suggested it could take three to four weeks to
plan and carry out a move of the framed drawings.
</P>
<P>
   That could give Mickey even more time for th museum to save his
home.

 &HT;    Georgia-Pacific to spin off timber-growing division
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - Georgia-Pacific Corp. shored up its pledge to move
away from its commodity roots Tuesday, saying it will no longer own
the trees that feed its pulp, paper and building products business.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific said it plans to spin off its timber-growing
arm, the Timber Co., and merge it with Plum Creek Timber Co.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed $4 billion deal, Plum Creek would become the
second-largest private timberland owner in the country and retain
headquarters in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The Timber Co. manages 5 million acres, primarily in the
Southeast. After the merger, Plum Creek would own 8 million acres
concentrated in the South, the Northeast and the Rocky Mountain
regions.
</P>
<P>
   The $4 billion deal includes $1 billion in Timber Co. debt.
Timber shareholders will get 1.37 shares of Plum Creek for each
share of Timber held.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is the second strategic move by Georgia-Pacific in as
many days. On Monday, the Atlanta-based company announced plans to
buy rival Fort James for $11 billion to become the largest maker of
tissue products.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific also plans to sell mills that don't fit its new
consumer-oriented focus.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific Chairman and Chief Executive Pete Correll told
analysts in New York on Tuesday that the Timber Co. spinoff and
merger mark a departure from traditional philosophies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manufacturers don't have to own timberlands to be
competitive,'' Correll said.
</P>
<P>
   The companies said that Plum Creek would keep the Timber Co.'s
office and employees in Atlanta. Plum Creek's president and chief
executive, Rick Holley, will retain his position in the merged
company. Timber Co. President and Chief Executive Don Glass would
become chief operating officer and a director.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction must get approval from the companies'
shareholders. They also need a ruling from the Internal Revenue
Service allowing the transaction to be tax-free to Georgia-Pacific
and Plum Creek, and the shareholders of Timber Co.

</P>
<P>
   The deal is the second strategic move by Georgia-Pacific in as
many days. On Monday, the Atlanta-based company announced plans to
buy rival Fort James for $11 billion to become the largest maker of
tissue products.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific also plans to sell mills that don't fit its new
consumer-oriented focus.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific Chairman and Chief Executive Pete Correll told
analysts in New York on Tuesday that the Timber Co. spinoff and
merger mark a departure from traditional philosophies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manufacturers don't have to own timberlands to be
competitive,'' Correll said.
</P>
<P>
   The companies said that Plum Creek would keep the Timber Co.'s
office and employees in Atlanta. Plum Creek's president and chief
executive, Rick Holley, will retain his position in the merged
company. Timber Co. President and Chief Executive Don Glass would
become chief operating officer and a director.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction must get approval from the companies'
shareholders. They also need a ruling from the Internal Revenue
Service allowing the transaction to be tax-free to Georgia-Pacific
and Plum Creek, and the shareholders of Timber Co.

BLACKS ALONE IN INCREASING VOTER TURNOUT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients)

 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ It's no surprise to Ealy Boyd that
African-American voter participation in Texas and across the nation
increased from 1994 to 1998, even though it was a non-presidential
election year.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Boyd was working out of a cramped office in Town
Center Mall, helping run the Tarrant County Democratic Party's
get-out-the-vote effort.
</P>
<P>
   He handed out candidates' literature, worked the phones and
urged people in the mall to stop by the voter registration table.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good message, but the issues brought people to the
polls,'' said Boyd, 65, a retired suburban Fort Worth resident who
remains active with the Democratic party.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the things that we fought dearly for in the 60's and
70's had eroded away with the Republican Congress,'' Boyd said.
``People were just tired of that. They showed it by voting.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, African-Americans were the only ethnic group to
increase voter participation in Congressional elections from 1994
to 1998 _ improving from 37 percent to 40 percent _ an 8 percent
increase _ according to U.S. Census figures released on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, the black vote mirrored national figures. The
African-American vote in Texas increased from 33.1 percent in 1994
to 36.7 percent in 1998, said Census researcher Avalaura Gaither
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Anglo vote in Texas increased from 39.4 percent in
1994 to 42.4 percent in 1998, the nationwide number of white voters
decreased from 50 percent to 47 percent during that period, the
figures show.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic turnout in the Lone Star State decreased to 15.3
percent in 1998 from 18.9 percent in 1994. Nationally, the Hispanic
vote remained at 20 percent, Gaither said.
</P>
<P>
   The increase by black voters is a sign of things to come, said
Gary Bledsoe, president of the Texas State Conference of NAACP
Branches.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an even more serious push this year to increase the
African-American vote,'' Bledsoe said yesterday from his office in
Austin. ``We're working to see to it that those figures increase
further.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, African-Americans were frustrated with former House
Speaker Newt Gingrich's controversial Contract with America, as
well as the conservative leadership in Congress, said Roy Brooks,
precinct administrator for Tarrant County Commissioner Dionne
Bagsby.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lack of ability to get our issues addressed in
Congress,'' he said. ``We tend to vote most when our issues are
threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   African-Americans were also angered by President Clinton's
treatment during the height of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the local level, voters were concerned about county politics,
said Brooks, president of the National Association of Black County
Officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``People often perceive that the African-American voting block
is unsophisticated, but nothing could be further from the truth,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, overall turnout was down three percentage points,
from 45 percent in 1994 to 42 percent in 1998, a decline of about 3
million voters, the census data showed.
</P>
<P>
   While other ethnic groups stayed home in large numbers during
the off-year election, the NAACP and religious leaders mounted a
grassroots effort to get African-Americans to the polls, Bledsoe
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we couldn't slack off because Newt Gingrich was
speaker and there were escalated attacks on affirmative action,''
he said. ``People who thought that their vote did not make a
difference came to realize that Congress was much more important
than they had previously thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Black leaders made a concerted effort to mobilize black voters,
said J. Matthew Wilson, a professor of political science at
Southern Methodist University.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were the only major demographic group to do that,'' he
said. ``They wanted to help Democratic candidates in congressional
elections, and it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks said he's delighted to know that the recent surge in
black voting has been documented.
</P>
<P>
   ``It lends credence to the fact that the black vote is still
vital and should be sought out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ealy, the Democratic Party worker, predicts that
African-Americans will increase the numbers further this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a critical election ahead of us,'' he said. ``I'll
certainly be out there trying to get people registered and to the
polls.''

ADVERTISING: TACO BELL DROPS THE CREATOR OF ITS WISECRACKING
CHIHUAHUA 
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Taco Bell, the fast-food chain specializing in Mexican-style
meals, is suddenly saying adios to TBWA/Chiat/Day, the agency that
created the company's popular talking Chihuahua character.
</P>
<P>
   Taco Bell, based in Irvine, Calif., said Tuesday that it would
dismiss TBWA/Chiat/Day after three years of producing national
advertising campaigns and consolidate its account, for now, at FCB
Worldwide, an agency that has handled other duties. The billings
for the entire account were estimated at more than $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   The dismissal of the Playa del Rey, Calif., office of
TBWA/Chiat/Day came with the abrupt simultaneous departure of Peter
Waller, who as Taco Bell's president headed its marketing efforts.
The changes reflect the intensifying competition in the fast-food
industry as marketers jostle one another for what they call share
of stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's increasingly difficult for the `quick service' players to
show the kinds of gains they enjoyed in the past,'' said Ron Paul,
president of Technomic in Chicago, a restaurant consulting company,
``and somebody has to be blamed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not shoot the messenger,'' he added, ``it's shoot the
agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite widespread acclaim for the canine character, which
talked thanks to computer-generated effects, Taco Bell's sales had
stagnated recently. The dog's role was played down in current
commercials that played up the quality of the chain's food instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not what we wanted to do,'' said Tom Carroll, president
and chief executive at the TBWA/Chiat/Day office, adding that the
dog, which uttered expressions like ``Yo quiero (I want) Taco
Bell,'' has been ``one of the best advertising icons in recent
memory, which helped Taco Bell with the younger consumers who eat
fast food most.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When we did the advertising we felt we should do and had the
product, we sold product,'' Carroll said. ``The business isn't
doing well and we're one of the victims.''
</P>
<P>
   The dismissal of TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit
of the Omnicom Group, was not entirely unexpected. The trade
publications Advertising Age and Adweek reported this week that
Taco Bell had awarded an undisclosed national assignment to the FCB
unit known as FCB Southern California, based in Costa Mesa, which
handles assignments like media buying and field marketing.
</P>
<P>
   FCB Southern California had created national campaigns for Taco
Bell, carrying themes like ``Run for the border,'' until 1994, when
it lost that assignment to Bozell Worldwide in Costa Mesa and
Richards Group in Dallas. TBWA/Chiat/Day succeeded them in March
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``FCB is a creative powerhouse'' that ``understands our
business,'' said David Novak, chief executive at Tricon Global
Restaurants in Louisville, Ky., which owns Taco Bell along with KFC
and Pizza Hut.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Novak praised FCB, which created Taco Bell ads
during the chain's largest sustained sales gains in the 1980s and
early '90s, as ``committed to driving our same-store sales growth
with compelling advertising.'' He also outlined the ``immediate
challenge'' that faces FCB: to ``give us a fresh creative approach
to help improve sales trends.''
</P>
<P>
   FCB will handle all aspects of the Taco Bell account, Novak
said, until Waller's successor, Emil Brolick, determines whether
the agency will keep the creative duties or whether they will be
placed in review. Brolick is joining Taco Bell, with the title
president and chief concept officer, from Wendy's International in
Dublin, Ohio, where he had most recently been senior vice president
for new product marketing, research and strategic planning.
</P>
<P>
   Novak said in his statement that he and Waller had ``mutually
agreed it is an appropriate time at Taco Bell to bring in a new,
outside perspective, both in terms of new management leadership and
advertising support.''
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Ryan, chief executive in New York at FCB, part of True
North Communications, said he would disagree with an assessment
that FCB has a lock on the national creative assignment, as Brolick
considers his next moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great opportunity for us,'' Ryan said, ``but new
clients or old clients, if you don't come through and drive sales,
you're going to be in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to come through,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of the Taco Bell assignment is a blow to
TBWA/Chiat/Day, which is known for creating characters that
entertain consumers as they peddle products.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the agency, creations like the Taco Bell
Chihuahua and Mr. K, the smiling mascot for Nissan cars and trucks,
have been deemed more effective at generating smiles than at
selling burritos or sedans.
</P>
<P>
   But Carroll disagreed, saying: ``It's an old rap that just
doesn't hold water. It's product and promotion that drive frequency
and loyalty in fast food. It's advertising's job to create a
window, and we created a pretty big window.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when brands are struggling,'' he added, referring to
the recent period when the Chihuahua was de-emphasized in the
campaign, ``good things are dismantled.''
</P>
<P>
   The dog that talked with a sassy attitude and a Mexican accent
was introduced by TBWA/Chiat/Day in 1997 as an incidental character
in a single commercial. But the idea captured the public's fancy
and the the dog began appearing in more spots, then soon became a
popular culture phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   The dog appeared on the annual ``It List'' of hot trends
published by Entertainment Weekly magazine as well as on
merchandise like T-shirts and hats. Giveaways of talking Chihuahua
dolls were among the most successful Taco Bell promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what plans FCB might have for the dog, Ryan said, ``I
don't want to go into that.''

CALDER`S 39-FOOT `EAGLE' HEADING FOR SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By REGINA HACKETT  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A bright red colossus is headed for Seattle: Alexander Calder's
39-foot sculpture ``Eagle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Art Museum announced Tuesday it had acquired the
1971 sculpture as the centerpiece of its planned Olympic Sculpture
Park with funds provided by former Microsoft president Jon Shirley
and his wife, Mary.
</P>
<P>
   Although the museum declined to say how much the sculpture cost,
dealers in the field estimated its value at roughly $7 million or
more. That's high for Calders but justified because of its size and
the fact that unique, monumental Calders rarely come on the market.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 10 years, the Shirleys have become two of the most
important art collectors and patrons in the region. Their interest
is modern and contemporary art, and they tend to buy in depth from
artists they admire, including New York painter Chuck Close. Once
they commit to an artist, they stay committed. For Close, they
helped fund his retrospective exhibit at New York's Museum of
Modern Art that appeared last year at the Seattle Art Museum,
thanks to the Shirleys' intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of art circles, Jon Shirley is best known as the third
president of Microsoft. In the 1980s, the long-time Tandy Corp.
executive brought business discipline to Bill Gates' young company
and steered it through the birth of the Windows operating system,
the move to the Redmond campus and the initial public stock
offering. He retired in 1990. Late last year, Forbes magazine
estimated his net worth at $653 million.
</P>
<P>
   Slated to open in 2003, the Sculpture Park has already been the
recipient of the Shirleys' generosity. They've given $10 million to
the creation of the park, the single largest donation and a hefty
portion of its $32 million overall cost: $17 million to purchase
the land, $15 for site development and $5 million for an endowment
fund to run it.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the museum had raised $29.3 million of the total,
leaving $7.7 million to go. Since then, the figure has grown only
by another $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the entire $32 million hits the museum's coffers,
there will be nothing left over for the purchase of art. Some
people have been wondering nervously if the seven and one-half acre
sculpture garden adjoining Myrtle Edwards Park on the Seattle
waterfront will turn out to be an empty shell, great for water and
mountain views and not so hot for artwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eagle'' proves such fears are groundless. The first piece
specifically earmarked for the park, ``Eagle'' will be its
keystone, creating what SAM director Mimi Gates called a ``lasting
legacy for generations to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates said acquiring the Calder was completely the Shirleys'
idea. ``They're committed to the park and to the power of outdoor
sculpture,'' she said. ``I love this piece, the fact that it's an
eagle, that there's tension between representation and abstraction.
It bursts upward with such graceful arches. I think it's the
perfect symbol for the city and for the museum.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there are a number of Calders in private collections in
the Northwest, this will be the only Calder sculpture in a public
collection in Seattle and the most important Calder in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The artist was still at the peak of his powers in 1971, the year
he was awarded the Gold Medal for Sculpture by the American Academy
of Arts and Letters and five years before his death at age 78.
</P>
<P>
   He was that rarity in modern art, a major figure who took
himself lightly. His made his substantial contribution by
celebrating the value of toys, circuses, free movement, abstract
form and lumpy, dumpy grace. He invented the idea of sculptural
mobiles, those masses of painted steel that hang in space and turn
freely, but even his stationary sculptures, such as ``Eagle,''
suggest movement in their motionless masses.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Philadelphia, the son of artist parents, Calder earned a
degree in mechanical engineering before turning his attention to
art in 1923, attending classes at the Art Students League in New
York and supporting himself with commercial illustrations.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris in 1926, he was first attracted to the
organically-shaped sculptures of Jean Arp and Joan Miro, as well as
the drawings of Paul Klee. Just as Klee said he wanted to take a
``line for a walk'' in his drawings,'' Calder decided he wanted to
take a line for a walk in his sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   He began making toys and circus figures out of wood, fabric and
metal, moving quickly to purely metal figures: drawings in space.
In 1930, he paid a decisive visit to Piet Mondrian's studio, where
the young sculptor was struck by the force of purely abstract art.
He told Mondrian he wanted to make the painter's sort of
abstractions move in space, which failed to create joy in the heart
of the older and more dogmatic artist.
</P>
<P>
   Calder wanted to sculpt volume without heavy mass, to entertain
space without filling it, to suggest instead of dictate. He thought
often of the music of the spheres and liked to think the universe
could hum. He wanted his sculptures to reflect that universal
tunefulness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eagle'' rests lightly on two feet with two abstracted wings in
the air, one bent informally forward, the bent wing breaking the
symmetry of the whole and giving a scruffy, devil-may-care grace.
</P>
<P>
   The sculpture will arrive early in the fall from its present
home in front of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, where it has been
on loan for nearly a year. The Seattle Art Museum has yet to
announce where ``Eagle'' will be placed until the Olympic Sculpture
Park opens.

 &HT;    Senate proclaims its `profound sorrow'
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Paul Coverdell, a former director of the Peace Corps
and Georgia's senior U.S. senator, died Tuesday of complications
resulting from a massive stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, 61, was pronounced dead at Piedmont Hospital at 6:10
p.m., 29 hours after undergoing emergency surgery to stop bleeding
in his brain.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell's wife, Nancy, other family members and Senate
Chaplain Lloyd Ogilvie were at his side. His death was quiet,
according to a brief statement issued by his Senate office in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.), a close friend,
announced Coverdell's death to the Senate at 7:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart is breaking,'' Lott said from the Senate floor. As
Lott stared at the podium, his voice cracked as he struggled to
compose his thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul has been a close friend and confidant, an outstanding
member of this Senate, and we will miss him greatly,'' Lott said.
``I just want to say to Nancy Coverdell and to the family that we
extend our sympathy and our love.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott then offered a resolution of the Senate:
</P>
<P>
   ``Whereas the Honorable Paul Coverdell served Georgia and the
United States Senate with devotion and distinction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whereas the Honorable Paul Coverdell served all the people in
the United States as director of the Peace Corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whereas his efforts on behalf of Georgians and all Americans
earned him the esteem and high regard of all his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``And whereas his untimely death has deprived his state and the
nation of an outstanding lawmaker and public servant, now therefore
be it resolved that the Senate has heard with profound sorrow and
deep regret the announcement of the death of the Honorable Paul
Coverdell, a senator for the state of Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for the Democrats, Sen. Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.)
called Coverdell ``a man of peace who did so much in his life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've known him so well, and miss him so much, and can only
share the thought that he rest in peace,'' Moynihan said.
</P>
<P>
   Said President Clinton: ``Paul Coverdell spent a lifetime
serving the people of Georgia and our country. He was a tireless
advocate who worked to ensure that all children have access to
quality education.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all in a state of shock,'' said Sen. Peter Fitzgerald
(R-Ill.). ``He was with us last week. .. And then today, they
discovered he had no brain activity. So I guess the best way to
describe the state of the Senate is a state of shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell's funeral arrangements had not been made public
Tuesday. Lott said the Senate will set aside time this week for
other senators to express appreciation for their colleague.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, Gov. Roy Barnes has the legal authority to name
a successor pending a special election Nov. 7, but he is not
required to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, who held the No. 5 position in the Republican
leadership and served on the Senate Finance Committee, was known
for his intense work ethic and self-effacing demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Elected in 1992, Coverdell was a blur of motion in the Senate,
moving from important committee deliberations to the Senate floor
for votes and back to his office for appointments.
</P>
<P>
   He became a leader in fashioning an education policy for
congressional Republicans, creating what he called ``A Plus''
accounts that permitted parents to set aside earnings in tax-free
education accounts.
</P>
<P>
   As director of the Peace Corps under President Bush and as an
Army veteran in the Far East, Coverdell developed a keen interest
in foreign affairs and became an expert on Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   He cast his last Senate vote Friday, to repeal estate taxes, an
issue at the top of his domestic legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell was highly regarded by Republicans and Democrats
alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul has not one enemy,'' said Sen. Larry Craig (R-Idaho).
</P>
<P>
   Tributes and expressions of sorrow poured in from around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, a friend of Coverdell's for more
than 20 years, called Coverdell's death a ``huge loss for his
family, his friends, his constituents in Georgia and our country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul's soft-spoken, hard-working ways will be sorely missed by
all of us who knew him and loved him,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson called
Coverdell a common-sense conservative who ``will be remembered as
an ardent defender of freedom.''

   Earlier in the day, Nicholson joined Senate Republicans in a

chairman of the RNC three years ago, Coverdell was the first person
to ``put his arms around me and say, 'We're going to get some

<P>
   Coverdell had been complaining of headaches off and on for
several weeks before being rushed to the hospital Saturday night
with severe pain.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors operated for two hours Monday after his condition
worsened and he experienced a massive hemorrhage inside his brain.
</P>
<P>
   The hemorrhage resulted in uncontrollable swelling, according to
the hospital, causing pressure on areas of the brain regulating
consciousness, breathing, pulse and blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell is survived by his mother and wife. The couple had no
children.

 &HT;    Senate proclaims its `profound sorrow'

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Paul Coverdell, a former director of the Peace Corps
and Georgia's senior U.S. senator, died Tuesday of complications
resulting from a massive stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, 61, was pronounced dead at Piedmont Hospital at 6:10
p.m., 29 hours after undergoing emergency surgery to stop bleeding
in his brain.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell's wife, Nancy, other family members and Senate
Chaplain Lloyd Ogilvie were at his side. His death was quiet,
according to a brief statement issued by his Senate office in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.), a close friend,
announced Coverdell's death to the Senate at 7:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart is breaking,'' Lott said from the Senate floor. As
Lott stared at the podium, his voice cracked as he struggled to
compose his thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul has been a close friend and confidant, an outstanding
member of this Senate, and we will miss him greatly,'' Lott said.
``I just want to say to Nancy Coverdell and to the family that we
extend our sympathy and our love.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott then offered a resolution of the Senate:
</P>
<P>
   ``Whereas the Honorable Paul Coverdell served Georgia and the
United States Senate with devotion and distinction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whereas the Honorable Paul Coverdell served all the people in
the United States as director of the Peace Corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whereas his efforts on behalf of Georgians and all Americans
earned him the esteem and high regard of all his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``And whereas his untimely death has deprived his state and the
nation of an outstanding lawmaker and public servant, now therefore
be it resolved that the Senate has heard with profound sorrow and
deep regret the announcement of the death of the Honorable Paul
Coverdell, a senator for the state of Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for the Democrats, Sen. Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.)
called Coverdell ``a man of peace who did so much in his life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've known him so well, and miss him so much, and can only
share the thought that he rest in peace,'' Moynihan said.
</P>
<P>
   Said President Clinton: ``Paul Coverdell spent a lifetime
serving the people of Georgia and our country. He was a tireless
advocate who worked to ensure that all children have access to
quality education.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all in a state of shock,'' said Sen. Peter Fitzgerald
(R-Ill.). ``He was with us last week. .. And then today, they
discovered he had no brain activity. So I guess the best way to
describe the state of the Senate is a state of shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell's funeral arrangements had not been made public
Tuesday. Lott said the Senate will set aside time this week for
other senators to express appreciation for their colleague.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, Gov. Roy Barnes has the legal authority to name
a successor pending a special election Nov. 7, but he is not
required to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, who held the No. 5 position in the Republican
leadership and served on the Senate Finance Committee, was known
for his intense work ethic and self-effacing demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Elected in 1992, Coverdell was a blur of motion in the Senate,
moving from important committee deliberations to the Senate floor
for votes and back to his office for appointments.
</P>
<P>
   He became a leader in fashioning an education policy for
congressional Republicans, creating what he called ``A Plus''
accounts that permitted parents to set aside earnings in tax-free
education accounts.
</P>
<P>
   As director of the Peace Corps under President Bush and as an
Army veteran in the Far East, Coverdell developed a keen interest
in foreign affairs and became an expert on Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   He cast his last Senate vote Friday, to repeal estate taxes, an
issue at the top of his domestic legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell was highly regarded by Republicans and Democrats
alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul has not one enemy,'' said Sen. Larry Craig (R-Idaho).
</P>
<P>
   Tributes and expressions of sorrow poured in from around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, a friend of Coverdell's for more
than 20 years, called Coverdell's death a ``huge loss for his
family, his friends, his constituents in Georgia and our country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul's soft-spoken, hard-working ways will be sorely missed by
all of us who knew him and loved him,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson called
Coverdell a common-sense conservative who ``will be remembered as
an ardent defender of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Nicholson joined Senate Republicans in a
prayer for their colleague. Nicholson recalled how when he became
chairman of the RNC three years ago, Coverdell was the first person
to ``put his arms around me and say, 'We're going to get some
things done.'''

and that we better value every day that we have an opportunity to
be at full speed,'' said Craig. ``But we tend not to think about
that until one of these circumstances happens.''

AIR-TRAFFIC SYSTEM APPROACHED GRIDLOCK, WITH DELAYS OF UP TO 8
HOURS 
</HEADLINE>
  (duplication notice: also sent with `t' code) 
 By JOE SHARKEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Business travelers who go online for information might consider
bookmarking the new Federal Aviation Administration Web site that
gives real-time information on flight delays. It is
www.fly.faa.gov. The ``fly'' in the Web address is amusingly
optimistic. ``No fly'' would be more accurate these days.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, for example, delays began piling up on Friday,
when many flights from the Midwest to the East Coast were running
eight hours late. The national airspace became snarled again on
Sunday. On the FAA site, you could click on links to 40 major
airports and observe, from Denver to the Atlantic, a system
approaching gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you could also go to the airport, wade through the
crowd of long faces and find one that did not look ready to
explode. At Newark International Airport around 9:30 p.m. on
Friday, one of those calmer visages belonged to Derrick Canady, a
computer network executive from Denver who was having a long day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left home at 6:30 this morning for a business trip to Fort
Lauderdale,'' Canady said as fellow-travelers milled around, some
anxiously pressing cell phones to their ears and muttering darkly
when they could not get a line because the demand was overloading
the circuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wouldn't tell us what was going on, which really annoyed
me,'' Canady said. He was flying on Continental Airlines, but his
complaint about not being able to get adequate information was
echoed by other travelers on other carriers. Most scoffed when
asked if their airlines had kept them informed.
</P>
<P>
   Providing credible, timely information on delays is a major
component of a vaunted voluntary passengers-rights code that the
airlines drafted last year to head off the threat of federal
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we asked what was going on, the airline's people looked
at us like we were crazy,'' Canady said. ``We were like, `Hey,
we're just trying to find out when we're going to be where you're
supposed to take us.'''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Some people were getting in shouting matches with
the flight attendants, but what good does that do? You might as
well make the best of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Making the best of it is good advice for business travelers this
summer, as a three-year crisis of delayed domestic flights
threatens to grow in the heaviest travel months of July and August.
According to the FAA, June was the worst month ever for delays.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, last Friday afternoon, as serial delays were
once again staggering the traveling public, the FAA and the airline
industry were trying to spin some good news. The FAA said that an
agreement had been reached with airline pilots' groups in a recent
dispute involving a decades-old landing procedure that some pilots
believe can create potentially unsafe conditions as runway traffic
increases. New rules to address the pilots' concerns are expected
to be issued in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   In the procedure, called ``land and hold short,'' the tower asks
a pilot to land normally and then pause at an intersecting runway
to allow another plane to take off before continuing on to the
terminal. Pilots balking at these maneuvers were responsible for
about 10 percent of the recent delays at O'Hare International
Airport in Chicago and about a quarter of the delays at Logan
International Airport in Boston, according to industry estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But those numbers do not begin to account for the 49,000 flight
delays the airlines racked up in June or the ones piling up this
month. Pilots aren't causing this crisis. The great majority of
delays are attributed to bad weather; huge, growing volume; and the
inability of the air-traffic control system and the airlines to
keep pace.
</P>
<P>
   The number of domestic airline passengers has doubled since
1980. The airlines are putting more planes in the air each year _ a
trend that is aggravated by growing use of smaller-capacity,
fuel-efficient regional jets. More planes in the air means more
planes that can be affected by weather.
</P>
<P>
   Short of requiring people to stay on the ground, there are no
easy answers. As delays grow, FAA critics denounce the agency for
bureaucratic ineptitude, and some are even calling for
privatization of the air-traffic control system. But opponents of
this proposal question of the wisdom of effectively ceding control
of the nation's air space to the airline industry, which they say
already has a propensity for discouraging competition and
consolidating routes and airport gate slots into regional quasi
monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   At Newark last Friday night, though, all of this was somewhat
academic. There, and in airports all over the country, the concerns
were more narrowly focused on the simple challenge of reaching a
destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I have to pay for a hotel,'' Canady said, finally
acknowledging defeat as the tote boards blinked one cancellation
after another. ``And all the flights I checked for Fort Lauderdale
tomorrow are overbooked already. So tomorrow, I might just get a
plane get back home to Denver instead. I'll start out again after
the weekend. I ought to be able to get there eventually, right?''

CLINTON GOING TO VIETNAM AFTER THE ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton is planning to visit Vietnam this
autumn, capping a five-year period in which he normalized relations
and then negotiated a trade agreement with a nation whose very name
is a shorthand for geopolitical and emotional issues still
unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   A White House official confirmed Tuesday that Clinton hopes to
make the trip in mid-November, a week after Election Day. The trip
would be the first visit of a US president to Vietnam since 1969,
when Richard M. Nixon visited Saigon, then the capital of South
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The journey of an American president to Vietnam, which now is
ruled by the Communist Party that two generations of French and US
military personnel tried but failed to defeat, would be an
unusually poignant event under any circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   But a trip undertaken by Clinton, the first president to come of
age in the Vietnam era, could provoke especially raw reactions. As
a college student in the Vietnam years, Clinton opposed US
involvement in the conflict and maneuvered to avoid the draft.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has not yet announced the president's intention
to visit Vietnam, but some preliminary arrangements have been made
and visas for the crew of Air Force One have been granted,
according to those familiar with planning the trip.
</P>
<P>
   The ostensible purpose for the visit is to mark a broad trade
agreement the United States and Vietnam reached last week. But
Vietnam occupies a special place in the American psyche, especially
for veterans and the baby-boom generation, and so the very footfall
of a president on Vietnamese soil automatically would be
transformed into an event of great significance.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials clearly hope the president's trip would be
a symbol of reconciliation with Vietnam and a signal of the good
faith of the United States after more than a quarter-century of
anxiety and ambiguity toward the Southeast Asian nation. But they
know the visit would also be a flashpoint for Clinton critics, who
almost certainly would contrast the president's eagerness to visit
Vietnam as a middle-aged man with his determination to avoid
service there as a young man.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton's trip would evoke a combination of reflection,
remembrance, bitterness, and anger in proportions difficult to
foresee, the significance of the visit goes far beyond any such
reactions.
</P>
<P>
   Important business and development issues would be involved.
Vietnam's gross domestic product, a conventional measure of a
nation's economic well-being, ranks 150th in the world. But already
many American and international businesses, including Caterpillar
and Nike, have made investments in Vietnam. And more companies are
expected to do so, taking advantage of a low-cost labor force eager
for work and of lower US tariffs growing out of the trade pact.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the political dynamics of Asia are changing swiftly,
and US officials are determined to take advantage of an opening in
the complex calculus of power politics.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatically, the Clinton trip would be designed to offer
Hanoi some maneuvering room in Asia. Vietnam's closest ties are
with the communists in China. But Hanoi, which has painful memories
of its dependence upon the former Soviet Union in the waning days
of the Vietnam conflict, is eager to lessen its reliance on a
single ally. For that reason, Vietnam has developed an important
new relationship with China and is exploring a broader relationship
with France.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Defense Secretary William S. Cohen visited
Vietnam, arguing that while Washington and Hanoi were unlikely to
become allies, there was room for a warmer relationship between the
two nations. The visit of Cohen, a former Republican senator from
Maine, was an important precursor to the Clinton trip.
</P>
<P>
   Although more than half of Vietnam's 77 million people were born
after the hostilities ended in 1975, the war remains a great burden
there. The government of Vietnam says it lost 3 million people in
the conflict, with another 800,000 left wounded, and 300,000 still
missing. The government complains that millions of gallons of
American defoliant chemicals used during the war continue to affect
the nation's soil and hundreds of thousands of its people.
</P>
<P>
   The war also left scars in the United States, which lost 58,000
people in the war along with its sense of invulnerability and
invincibility. The war, along with the civil-rights movement,
triggered youth rebellion and an era of protest. One of those
caught up in the protests was Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's opposition to the war was passionate _ and, it turned
out, permanently recorded.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter he wrote to Colonel Eugene J. Holmes, the director
of the ROTC program at the University of Arkansas, Clinton spoke of
``working every day against a war I opposed and despised.'' Though
Clinton was not in the front ranks of antiwar activists, he worked
in the national headquarters of the Vietnam Moratorium and, as a
student at Oxford, promoted antiwar demonstrations in Great
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, which became public during Clinton's 1992
presidential campaign, speaks of Clinton's ``opposition to the
draft and the war,'' with Clinton saying, ``I am in great sympathy
with those who are not willing to fight, kill, and maybe die for
their country (i.e. the particular policy of a particular
government) right or wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the president, with the aid of Vietnam veterans such as
Senators John McCain, the Arizona Republican, and John F. Kerry,
the Massachusetts Democrat, pressed forward with establishing
normal diplomatic relations with Vietnam in 1995. The two nations
reached their trade agreement early this month, though Congress
still must approve the pact.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have full diplomatic relations with Vietnam,'' said

AIR-TRAFFIC SYSTEM APPROACHED GRIDLOCK, WITH DELAYS OF UP TO 8
HOURS 
</HEADLINE>
  (duplication notice: also sent with `f' code) 
 By JOE SHARKEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Business travelers who go online for information might consider
bookmarking the new Federal Aviation Administration Web site that
gives real-time information on flight delays. It is
www.fly.faa.gov. The ``fly'' in the Web address is amusingly
optimistic. ``No fly'' would be more accurate these days.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, for example, delays began piling up on Friday,
when many flights from the Midwest to the East Coast were running
eight hours late. The national airspace became snarled again on
Sunday. On the FAA site, you could click on links to 40 major
airports and observe, from Denver to the Atlantic, a system
approaching gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you could also go to the airport, wade through the
crowd of long faces and find one that did not look ready to
explode. At Newark International Airport around 9:30 p.m. on
Friday, one of those calmer visages belonged to Derrick Canady, a
computer network executive from Denver who was having a long day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left home at 6:30 this morning for a business trip to Fort
Lauderdale,'' Canady said as fellow-travelers milled around, some
anxiously pressing cell phones to their ears and muttering darkly
when they could not get a line because the demand was overloading
the circuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wouldn't tell us what was going on, which really annoyed
me,'' Canady said. He was flying on Continental Airlines, but his
complaint about not being able to get adequate information was
echoed by other travelers on other carriers. Most scoffed when
asked if their airlines had kept them informed.
</P>
<P>
   Providing credible, timely information on delays is a major
component of a vaunted voluntary passengers-rights code that the
airlines drafted last year to head off the threat of federal
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we asked what was going on, the airline's people looked
at us like we were crazy,'' Canady said. ``We were like, `Hey,
we're just trying to find out when we're going to be where you're
supposed to take us.'''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Some people were getting in shouting matches with
the flight attendants, but what good does that do? You might as
well make the best of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Making the best of it is good advice for business travelers this
summer, as a three-year crisis of delayed domestic flights
threatens to grow in the heaviest travel months of July and August.
According to the FAA, June was the worst month ever for delays.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, last Friday afternoon, as serial delays were
once again staggering the traveling public, the FAA and the airline
industry were trying to spin some good news. The FAA said that an
agreement had been reached with airline pilots' groups in a recent
dispute involving a decades-old landing procedure that some pilots
believe can create potentially unsafe conditions as runway traffic
increases. New rules to address the pilots' concerns are expected
to be issued in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   In the procedure, called ``land and hold short,'' the tower asks
a pilot to land normally and then pause at an intersecting runway
to allow another plane to take off before continuing on to the
terminal. Pilots balking at these maneuvers were responsible for
about 10 percent of the recent delays at O'Hare International
Airport in Chicago and about a quarter of the delays at Logan
International Airport in Boston, according to industry estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But those numbers do not begin to account for the 49,000 flight
delays the airlines racked up in June or the ones piling up this
month. Pilots aren't causing this crisis. The great majority of
delays are attributed to bad weather; huge, growing volume; and the
inability of the air-traffic control system and the airlines to
keep pace.
</P>
<P>
   The number of domestic airline passengers has doubled since
1980. The airlines are putting more planes in the air each year _ a
trend that is aggravated by growing use of smaller-capacity,
fuel-efficient regional jets. More planes in the air means more
planes that can be affected by weather.
</P>
<P>
   Short of requiring people to stay on the ground, there are no
easy answers. As delays grow, FAA critics denounce the agency for
bureaucratic ineptitude, and some are even calling for
privatization of the air-traffic control system. But opponents of
this proposal question of the wisdom of effectively ceding control
of the nation's air space to the airline industry, which they say
already has a propensity for discouraging competition and
consolidating routes and airport gate slots into regional quasi
monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   At Newark last Friday night, though, all of this was somewhat
academic. There, and in airports all over the country, the concerns
were more narrowly focused on the simple challenge of reaching a
destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I have to pay for a hotel,'' Canady said, finally
acknowledging defeat as the tote boards blinked one cancellation
after another. ``And all the flights I checked for Fort Lauderdale
tomorrow are overbooked already. So tomorrow, I might just get a
plane get back home to Denver instead. I'll start out again after
the weekend. I ought to be able to get there eventually, right?''

INVESTMENTS HELP MICROSOFT PROFITS DURING QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RICHMAN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Microsoft Tuesday reported profits up 10 percent for
the just-completed quarter, but left some analysts worried that the
software maker's good results say more about investment strategy
than performance.
</P>
<P>
   The software giant posted net income of $2.41 billion, or 44
cents a share, for its fiscal fourth quarter ended June 30. That
compares to $2.2 billion, or 40 cents a share, in the same quarter
the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft was expected to earn 42 cents a share, according to
analysts' estimates compiled by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Despite concerns about the rising share of profit derived from
investment, analysts also said the quarterly results suggest that
Microsoft seems to be skillfully handling the uncertainties it
faces in its business and on the legal front. It is in the midst of
a transition in its product markets as its new Windows 2000
operating system is adopted gradually by corporate customers, at a
time when the business market for computers has been sluggish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a slow but steady transitionary quarter from Microsoft
sprinkled with some optimism for the future,'' said Richard
Sherlund, an analyst at Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues met expectations at $5.8 billion, compared to $5.76
billion a year earlier. Most analysts had trimmed their revenue
forecasts after the company warned last quarter that business
demand for personal computers looked weak.
</P>
<P>
   For the fiscal year, the company announced net income of $9.42
billion, or $1.70 per share, a 20 percent increase over fiscal
1999. Revenue for the year totalled $22.96 billion, a 16 percent
increase over last year.
</P>
<P>
   But the company has been criticized for beating estimates
through high investment income rather than profits from its own
products. And that criticism continued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think they'd have that much investment income,'' said
Bill Epifanio, a financial analyst with J.P. Morgan. ``It was
expected that they'd take quite a bit from investments, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Fully $1.13 billion of the quarter's net income, or 47 percent,
came from investments, not from operating income, which includes
licensing fees, sales and other indicators of the company's own
health. Investment income has increased steadily at Microsoft over
at least the past five quarters.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of June, cash and marketable securities reached $23.8
billion, up from $17.2 billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Microsoft has a $17.8 billion portfolio of equity
investments in technology companies, which are typically business
partners of Microsoft. In fiscal 2000 alone, Microsoft made 100
such investments totaling $5.4 billion. If those companies are
acquired, for example, Microsoft must sell its stake and report the
gain as portfolio income.
</P>
<P>
   But operating income has actually been shrinking, dropping 14
percent since fourth-quarter 1999. Investment income made up only
22 percent of the company's net income that quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's chief financial officer John Connors acknowledged
how important investment income has become to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the single biggest factor (in the investment gains)
was just the average size of our portfolio,'' Connors said. ``This
quarter was probably a little higher than we had planned.''
</P>
<P>
   But he defended the quarter's investment income, noting that
Microsoft's investment strategies involve companies that will help
Microsoft grow the overall computer industry. He added that the
lower pre-tax operating profit was due to an unusually high
year-ago quarter that saw revenues and profits lifted by special
items.
</P>
<P>
   Connors said highlights of the quarter included strong revenue
growth in Microsoft's consumer business, particularly its MSN unit,
which runs an Internet access service and operates a network of
increasingly popular Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which competes in those markets against America
Online and Yahoo!, said MSN subscribers grew 20 percent to 3
million in the quarter, with traffic to the network's Web sites
expanding by 19 percent and average visit times rising 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As he did last quarter, Connors sounded a cautionary note on the
near-term growth of personal computer sales to businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw a mixed demand in the quarter for business PCs,''
Connors said, adding that the market was weak in May but seemed to
climb back somewhat in June. ``What we're really hoping to see is
really three months of sustained growth in the business PC
segment.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in line with guidance he gave last quarter, Connors told
analysts and reporters on a conference call he expects profits for
the current quarter to come in at 41 cents a share, up nearly 8
percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Connors said enthusiasm for Windows 2000, Microsoft's operating
system for corporate computers, was strong. But he gave no sales
figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel really good about the progress we're making in the
server business,'' Connors said without elaborating. ``We're on
track with Windows 2000 on the business side.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Microsoft.NET, the sweeping strategy Microsoft launched
in June, won't contribute to revenues until at least fiscal 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The results were announced after the market closed. Shares
climbed 38 cents in after-hours trading. The stock had gained 31
cents, to $78.50, before the market closed.

GOVERNOR'S MANSION IS A TRIPLE-WIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ Janet Huckabee would like it understood that
the first family of Arkansas is not moving into a trailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a trailer,'' she explained Tuesday, standing near
her husband, Gov. Mike Huckabee, in their backyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trailers are pulled behind a pickup truck,'' Huckabee said.
``We are not having a trailer on the mansion grounds.'' Nor is it,
she explained, a mobile home, since the Huckabees are not going
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it a double-wide?'' she continued. ``The answer is no. It's
a triple-wide. So get it right, OK?''
</P>
<P>
   Very well _ to be precise, the Huckabees will be living for the
next year in what the industry calls ``manufactured housing,'' the
kind that is built in a factory and then trucked to a site in two
or three pieces. It will be in the backyard at the Governor's
Mansion, about to undergo a long-overdue renovation.
</P>
<P>
   This is, of course, a move fraught with risk for any governor,
let alone for one whose state already lacks a reputation as the
nation's most urbane. When J.D. Harper, the executive director of
the state's Manufactured Housing Association, praised the Huckabees
Tuesday for their ``courage,'' he was not referring to their
willingness to attract tornadoes, since the mansion has had no
trouble attracting them on its own. (The grounds were heavily
damaged by a twister last year.)
</P>
<P>
   No, Huckabee knew exactly what he was talking about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know _ of all the states in the world, for Arkansas to be
the one with a governor living in manufactured housing _ well, you
can just hear the jokes already,'' she said in an interview. In
fact, the jokes have already begun. Last week, Jay Leno warned that
the move would not go over well with Arkansas voters, who might
think living in a double-wide would constitute putting on airs.
</P>
<P>
   But the Huckabees are determined to go through with this, and
not just because at least 12 percent of the state's population
lives in manufactured housing, according to the 1990 Census. The
fact is that the temporary home, when it arrives factory-fresh next
month, will be larger at 2,131 square feet than the residential
space in the mansion, where the Huckabees and their three
college-age children have had to live in about 1,200 square feet,
about the size of a modest New York apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The mansion, a brick Georgian built without much foresight in
1950, is small by gubernatorial standards, mostly formal parlors
that are heavily visited by tourists who want to see the home once
occupied by Bill and Hillary Clinton. (The Clintons tinkered with
the design but made no major structural changes.) Large receptions
are held in an outdoor tent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You open the door to your bedroom, and there's someone taking
a tour,'' said Huckabee, a Republican who has lived in the house
for four years. ``There's no privacy. We have to go in one of the
kids' bedrooms to watch TV.'' And, his wife added, the circuit
breakers trip if two people use hair dryers.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the temporary home, a high-end Eagle Point model
built by Champion Homes, will have a family room, a dining room, a
great room, a kitchen, a fireplace and three bedrooms, with
easy-to-clean vinyl siding, a washer and dryer, and amenities
considered the state of the art in manufactured housing.
</P>
<P>
   According to the company's brochure, the model is ``specifically
designed to appeal to the nation's largest and hottest new home
market segment _ the aging baby boomer.'' Huckabee is 44, his wife
just turned 45.
</P>
<P>
   When the industry heard that the family was planning to move out
of the mansion so that it could be expanded and renovated, several
manufacturers competed for the honor of donating the home, which is
worth about $110,000. After rejecting the security complications of
living in an apartment, the Huckabees accepted the offer as a
cost-saving measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of any other governors who have lived in our
products,'' Harper said. ``There is a certain stigma attached, and
we know all the jokes. But in fact this is a way for many people to
afford their own homes. So an opportunity like this gives us the
forum we need to show what our potential is.''
</P>
<P>
   The mansion is inside a fenced seven-acre compound in the Quapaw
section, a historic district near downtown filled with Queen Annes,
Greek revivals, and nothing that appeared to have arrived by truck.
Zoning rules do not even allow such dwellings. But the neighbors
don't seem to mind, as long as no one else tries to bring one in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad they're not leaving the neighborhood,'' said
Wendy Quaid, who was gardening this morning in front of her 1881
Colonial, a few doors down from the mansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a governor here kind of helps the stability of the
neighborhood,'' Quaid said. ``Even if he's living in a trailer.''

APPLE REPORTS EARNINGS GAIN, BUT DISAPPOINTING SALES
</HEADLINE>
 By MATT RICHTEL  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ On the eve of its semiannual MacWorld trade
show, Apple Computer delivered mixed quarterly returns on Tuesday,
with earnings exceeding analyst expectations but sales falling
short of projections in light of disappointing sales of the iMac,
the company's staple consumer computer.
</P>
<P>
   But Apple executives promised to introduce new products on
Wednesday at MacWorld in New York that they suggested should spur
sales.
</P>
<P>
   For its third quarter, which ended July 1, Apple reported
earnings of $163 million, or 45 cents a share, a penny more a share
than analysts estimated. That figure compares with $114 million, or
35 cents a share, in the same quarter a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The figure does not include $37 million in capital gains the
company reported from the sale of some of its shares of ARM
Holdings during the quarter. Taking those returns into account, the
company reported earnings of $200 million, or 55 cents a share,
though analysts said the capital gain was a one-time return that
should not be included in an analysis of Apple's operating fiscal
health.
</P>
<P>
   But the good news on earnings was tempered by
lower-than-expected sales of $1.83 billion. That is 17 percent
higher than the $1.56 billion a year ago, but lower than the $1.9
billion many analysts had expected for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mixed quarter _ the revenue line was a tad
disappointing,'' said Charlie Wolf, executive director of UBS
Warburg, a New York-based investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   One reason revenues were below expectations was that sales of
the company's colorful iMac computers fell short of both company
and analyst projections. Fred Anderson, Apple's chief financial
officer, said 450,000 iMac's were sold in the quarter, not the
500,000 Apple had initially projected.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said he believed sales had fallen short because some
potential customers were waiting for a new version of the iMac.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that anticipation of a refresh of our product
family was the primary factor'' for the lower sales, Anderson said
during a conference call, though he declined to be specific about
the product announcements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been about nine months since we've made any major product
introductions, but we're going to change that tomorrow and we think
you will be impressed,'' Anderson said, apparently referring not
just to iMac but to other Apple products.
</P>
<P>
   Apple has long used the MacWorld stage as a forum for
introducing new products, typically keeping the announcements a
secret until the day of the show. Industry analysts speculated on
Tuesday that Apple would probably update the iMac but also announce
new products, including, perhaps, a low-cost device to connect to
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said that the announcements might obscure any clear
stock market response to the earnings report, since the products
will be introduced during the keynote address of Steven P. Jobs,
Apple's chief executive, shortly after the market opens. ``There is
not going to be any pure play on the earnings,'' Wolf said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the stock fell $1.0625, to $57.25, on the Nasdaq. It
fell as low as $53 in after-hours trading. The stock has more than
doubled in the last 12 months but is down about one quarter from
its high in March.
</P>
<P>
   The reason that earnings rose despite disappointing sales may be
explained by an increase in the company's gross margins, a measure
of how much the company's sales exceeded the cost of producing its
goods. In the quarter, the company reported gross margins of 29.8
percent, Anderson said, compared with 28.2 percent last quarter.
</P>
<P>
   David C. Bailey, a research analyst with Gerard Klauer Mattison
&AMP; Co., said the gross margin increase had exceeded his estimate of
28.7 percent for the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson attributed the increase in gross margins to three
factors: lower costs for components; growth in Internet sales,
which have higher margins; and a higher mix of sales being from its
professional line of products, the Power Book and Power Mac.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Anderson cautioned that the gross margin would
likely fall again in the coming months because of expected
increases in the costs of components, notably in memory and optical
devices. He said the company hoped to keep margins around 27
percent.

PAUL COVERDELL, 61, DIES; INFLUENTIAL SENATOR FROM GEORGIA 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC SCHMITT and LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen &UR; . &LR;  Paul Coverdell of Georgia, a soft-spoken but
influential Republican leader, died Tuesday night in Atlanta, his
hometown, from a massive cerebral hemorrhage he suffered over the
weekend. He was 61.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell had undergone surgery on Monday after being
hospitalized for severe headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Rising rapidly, if almost invisibly, in the inner circles of
Senate power, Coverdell emerged as a close confidant of Majority
Leader Trent Lott, of Mississippi. Lott often turned to Coverdell,
a self-effacing former insurance executive, to handle some of the
most difficult and politically unrewarding jobs.
</P>
<P>
   An ally and longtime friend of former President George Bush,
Coverdell was the chief liaison in the Senate to the presidential
campaign of Bush's son, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul's death is a huge loss to his family, his friends, his
constituents in Georgia and our country,'' the governor said in a
statement released through his campaign office. ``Paul's
soft-spoken, hard-working ways will be sorely missed by all of us
who knew him and loved him.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Senate floor Tuesday night, Lott choked back tears in
praising his former colleague. ``Paul has been a close friend and
confidant, and an outstanding member of this body,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Tuesday night, President Clinton praised
Coverdell's contributions to the Senate and the country. ``He was a
tireless advocate who worked to ensure that all children have
access to quality education,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell's death, which follows the death last year of another
sitting Republican senator, John Chafee of Rhode Island, opens a
Republican seat at time when the party holds a 55-to-45 margin.
</P>
<P>
   Under Georgia law, the state's Democratic governor, Roy Barnes,
will appoint an interim replacement until a special election can be
held.
</P>
<P>
   The state's other senator, Max Cleland, a Democrat, said the two
possible candidates for the interim position would be Michael
Coles, the Democratic cookie magnate who lost to Coverdell in the
1998 election, and a former Democratic representative, Buddy
Darden. Barnes seemed unlikely to offer himself for the Senate
since he was elected only two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Cleland, who was sworn into the Georgia state Senate on the same
day as Coverdell 30 years ago, expressed his respect for his former
colleague. ``He never showed a trace of personal ego or
animosity,'' Cleland said Tuesday. ``He loved public service, he
loved politics and he loved to contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell was elected to the Senate in 1992, squeaking out a
victory over the liberal Democratic incumbent, Wyche Fowler Jr.,
and signaling a shift in Georgia politics. He was re-elected in
1998, despite concerns about his political vulnerability, much of
it fueled by his low-key, behind-the-scenes style of getting things
done.
</P>
<P>
   As the fourth-ranking Republican in the Senate, Coverdell held
the title of secretary of the conference. But he was expected to
move up the ladder to conference chairman with the retirement this
fall of Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   As secretary, Coverdell essentially ran the marketing department
for Senate Republicans, putting his organizational prowess to work
in shaping the party's message in five areas: education, taxes,
Social Security, defense and drug prevention.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Coverdell's interests and expertise ranged
broadly. He championed education savings accounts, a signature
Republican issue. He was a chief backer of a $1.3 billion aid
package to help Colombia combat drug traffickers protected by rebel
insurgents.
</P>
<P>
   And in a chamber defined by Washington Monument-sized egos,
Coverdell relished his image as a quiet insider. ``He was a humble
man who brought to the public discourse good ideas and common-sense
solutions,'' House Speaker Dennis Hastert said in a statement. ``He
didn't care who received the credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott affectionately called Coverdell ``Mikey,'' for the boy in
the Life cereal commercial who would ``eat anything.'' Coverdell,
Lott has said, would do anything that was asked of him, and do it
with enthusiasm. In fact, outside of work, he had few other
interests or hobbies.
</P>
<P>
   On the Senate floor, Coverdell was not a particularly eloquent
speaker and reporters sometimes struggled to find a single
straight-forward quote of his that they could use.
</P>
<P>
   But his timid demeanor belied his commitment to Republican
politics and his partisan drive. A conservative on most issues,
Coverdell did not hesitate to fight for tax cuts and a smaller
federal government, two favorite Republican themes.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell served in the Georgia state Senate from 1970 to 1989,
and was minority leader for 14 years. Coverdell often joked that he
knew too well what it was like being an underdog since, as minority
leader in the Senate, he represented all of five Republicans, as
opposed to 51 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   It was during this time that he first met President Bush, who
was then U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, and the encounter
led to a lifelong friendship. Coverdell was a frequent visitor to
Bush's vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine, despite his professed
incompetence on the golf course and aboard a fishing boat. ``I'm
not a golfer,'' he said during a recent interview. ``And I tangled
up his fishing reel.''
</P>
<P>
   He served as state chairman for the Georgia Republican Party
from 1985 to 1987. In 1989, Coverdell was named director of the
Peace Corps, a position which cemented his interest in foreign
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, his loyalty to the Bush family led to his selection
as Senate liaison to Governor Bush's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Des Moines on Jan. 29, 1939, Coverdell spent a large
part of his childhood in the Midwest. He earned a bachelor's degree
in journalism from the University of Missouri in 1961, and then
joined the Army in 1962, serving in Okinawa, among other places.
After leaving the Army, he helped his parents start the family's
Atlanta insurance and financial services business, Coverdell &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by wife, Nancy, a former flight attendant. They
had no children.

COMMENTARY: DELUSIONS OF GENEROSITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL KRUGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Mr. Clinton,'' declared the full-page ad in Tuesday's New York
Times, ``the American people would rather spend $40 billion to
rescue Social Security than to rescue your legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad denounced the possibility that an agreement at Camp David
might include substantial promises of aid to the Palestinians. Then
it referred interested readers to the Web site of Americans for
Responsible Foreign Spending, which _ like the ad itself _ gives
absolutely no hint about who these ``Americans'' might be. There
are no names of officers, no endorsements of the group by named
individuals. Nothing in the ad or on the Web site refutes the
hypothesis that the group is actually a front for Islamic
militants, out to sabotage the negotiations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But I doubt it. After all, the supposed conflict between foreign
aid and Social Security has been the subject of a steady stream of
press releases from House Republican leaders. For example, last
year the office of Tom DeLay, the majority whip, declared that
``the president's requests for foreign aid would directly raid the
Social Security trust fund.'' ( &UR; Directly? &LR;  Let's just say that
DeLay's definition of ``direct'' is even further from common usage
than Clinton's definition of ``sex''). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's a pretty safe guess, then, that this is just hardball
domestic politics _ though the peculiarly self-effacing behavior of
Americans for Responsible Foreign Spending suggests that they fear
that even today's hardened voters might look askance at politicians
willing to undermine sensitive peace negotiations for the sake of
partisan advantage. But even aside from the shamelessness of this
particular ploy, the House Republican campaign against foreign aid
reveals a startling lack of scruples _ a willingness not only to
mislead the American public, but to do so on an issue that for
millions of people is literally a matter of life and death.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some background facts: The foreign aid budget for next year,
which Congress finally approved last week after much brinkmanship,
provided a total of $13.3 billion. That is only a bit more than
half of 1 percent of federal spending _ or to put it differently,
we spend somewhat less on foreign aid in a year than we spend on
Social Security and Medicare every week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But even this gives an exaggerated impression of how much
America ``gives away'' in foreign aid. Only about half of our
foreign aid budget is for ``humanitarian and development''
purposes; the other half is justified by ``national security'' _
that is, it consists either of military aid or of financial
assistance to governments that play some role in our defense
strategy. In particular, out of that $13.3 billion aid budget, no
less than $4.8 billion will go to Israel and Egypt. The whole of
sub-Saharan Africa, by contrast, will get not much more than $1
billion. Harvard's Jeffrey Sachs puts it this way: Each year the
average American is asked to pay a grand total of $4 in taxes
toward helping the world's poorest 600 million people. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because we give so little, these days debates about foreign aid
are not about whether corrupt Third World governments should have
more money to play with; they are about how many million people are
going to die of malaria, or AIDS, or simple starvation _ millions
who would not die if another few dollars per American were
available to support public health programs and agricultural
research. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Why are Americans so hard-hearted? The answer is that they
probably aren't _ they are just misinformed. Opinion polls suggest
that the average voter thinks that foreign aid is a budget item as
big as or bigger than defense or Social Security, maybe 15 percent
of the total _ and that he wants to cut it to something like 5
percent, unaware that that would be 10 times what we actually
spend. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Republicans aren't in fact suggesting that we should
forgo the chance of peace in the Middle East because it might force
George W. Bush to cut taxes by only $1.26 trillion instead of $1.3
trillion. But they are, quite deliberately, encouraging American
voters in the delusion that we are being excessively generous to
the world. And in so doing they are indeed making a trade-off _ not
the pretended trade-off of foreign aid for Social Security, but a
very real trade-off of foreign lives for American votes.  &QL;

COMMENTARY: DECODING MALE DNA: WHASSUP? 
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Desperate to catch up to the summer reality
phenomenon, NBC-TV executives are close to a deal for a show called
``Chains of Love,'' in which a young woman selects four men from a
pool of 100 prospects. The four men are then chained to the woman's
wrists and ankles, two on each side, for a week, while she
eliminates them one by one, until she gets to Mr. Right. Or perhaps
Mr. Left. (No ball and chain jokes.)
</P>
<P>
   Questioned at the press tour here Tuesday about the cheesiness
of this program, which was a hit in the Netherlands, NBC's
president of entertainment, Garth Ancier, protested ``It's a
relationship show.'' Once the laughter among the audience of TV
writers died down, a chagrined Ancier added, ``That wasn't supposed
to be funny.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a truth universally acknowledged that romance and reality
are mutually exclusive, but TV executives are obsessed with those
two topics at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   When they are not negotiating for reality programs that create
creepy Darwinian showdowns on a double-decker bus, in a prison, in
a boot camp, in a hair salon, in an apartment of five girls and one
houseboy who want to be celebrities, programmers are trying to come
up with the male version of ``Sex and the City.''
</P>
<P>
   One network executive said that this season every network had
three shows in development that aspired to be the male ``Sex and
the City,'' pulling back the curtain on how men really talk about
women, the same way the HBO hit lets men be privy to all that
female post-game analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The men I know think you cannot reverse the formula. ``Men don't
have any secrets,'' says one. ``And if they did, they wouldn't sit
around talking about them in groups at brunch over cosmopolitans.
It would not get much past `Wow! Look at her.' And `Whassup?'''
</P>
<P>
   Just try to switch genders for this week's episode of ``Sex and
the City,'' which is about the girls worrying about having too many
sex partners. No man has ever been consumed with fear about being a
slut.
</P>
<P>
   One attempt that will air this fall on ABC is ``Madigan Men,''
reteaming Broadway's ``Moon for the Misbegotten'' actors Gabriel
Byrne and Roy Dotrice as a father and son in New York. Byrne plays
a sensitive architect, the father of a teen-age son, whose wife has
left him for their nutritionist.
</P>
<P>
   The show's ridiculous premise is that Gabriel Byrne would find
it hard to make his way in the New York dating scene, and that
Irish men would talk to each other _ even for half an hour once a
week over Guinness _ about their emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Byrne, who came to NBC with the idea, said he had been inspired
by the covers of women's magazines and by ``Sex and the City.''
``What `Sex and the City' does so wonderfully is it opened that
secret world of women for examination by men,'' he says. ``It was
incredibly fascinating to men because it looked like a secret door
into a world that we knew nothing about.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Byrne, the only door likely to be opened by
this show is the one marked ``exit,'' since it focuses more on
father-son angst and Irish proverbs (``A windy day is not the day
for thatching'') than giving women tips on the male psyche and how
to tame it.
</P>
<P>
   Fox may have better luck since it went straight to the source,
Darren Star, the creator of ``Sex and the City,'' to design its new
series about single men and their tempestuous dating behavior.
``The Street'' is about carnivorous, libidinous young stockbrokers
working in a Wall Street firm, and their adventures with gorgeous
bankers, Russian strippers/day traders, hermaphrodites and
receptionists looking to climb by reading The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   The secrets about men start spilling in the first show, when the
firm successfully launches an IPO for a company selling Ivy league
sperm. ``Yale sperm is worth more than Penn sperm,'' says one
partner, ``and anyone can tell you that.''
</P>
<P>
   Here at least we can learn some profound truths about men, what
they talk about when they get together for a beer, what kind of
women really appeal to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Xena?'' one guy asks another. ``Or Buffy?''

AMERICAN LEGION SEEKS TO OPEN DOORS TO COLD WAR VETERANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MIKE BARBER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For decades, nearly seven million veterans who kept
vigil during the uneasy peace of the Cold War have gotten the cold
shoulder from the nation's largest veterans lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Even after they braved atomic bomb tests, stood watch in missile
silos, flew bombers on patrol and risked a silent death under the
sea, they remain ineligible to join the 2.8 million-member ranks of
the congressionally chartered American Legion.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: Their hitches in the Army, Navy, Air Force or
Marines were during a time of official peace. Congress never
declared a Cold War with the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday Harbor, Wash., though, the Legion's nearly 500-member
Hackett-Larson Post No. 163 voted unanimously last January to
change all that.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, its outgoing commander, former Marine Peter
DeLorenzi, will lead the charge at the Legion's state convention in
Yakima, Wash., introducing a resolution to allow Cold War vets to
join the Legion nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a beachstormer from way back,'' DeLorenzi said of his
mission in Yakima.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the preamble to the Legion constitution is to make
right the master of might, and this situation with Cold War
veterans is a great injustice,'' he said. ``This is the first
attempt at the state level to recognize them and have it presented
nationally.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale Davis, who commands Washington state's 37,000 Legionnaires,
said if the measure is approved by the membership Saturday, it will
be taken to the national convention in Milwaukee in December.
</P>
<P>
   State leaders won't take a stance until the membership decides
on what he described as ``a well thought out resolution,'' he said.
``We're a grass roots organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he's unsure how many of the state's estimated 300,000
veterans might be affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like it would be a small number who are not eligible
because the U.S. government has managed to become involved in
conflicts almost constantly since World War II,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Legion is also looking out for its own interests. With World
War II vets nationwide dying at a rate of 1,000 per day, the
powerful lobby must keep up its strength.
</P>
<P>
   Post 163's resolution follows the action of Congress, which last
year officially acknowledged Sept. 2, 1945 to Dec. 26, 1991 as
``The Cold War,'' and authorized a certificate of recognition for
those who served, though not a campaign medal or ribbon.
</P>
<P>
   Congress pegged the start of the Cold War as the day Japan
surrendered at the end of World War II through the day the Soviet
Union officially dissolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that they are recognized as war veterans by Congress, we
hope it will be the final push to eligibility,'' DeLorenzi said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, some Legionnaires grumble, it's not like peacetime vets
can't out-flank the convoluted rules to join up. For example, a
male peacetime veteran can participate as a guest of his wife, even
if she has no military experience but joins the Legion's Women's
Auxiliary, which is open any woman whose father, uncle, stepfather
or a mother _ is or was in the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our prime motivating factors,'' DeLorenzi said, ``is
that we have a man who comes into the Legion with his wife, an
auxiliary member, and they have two children on active duty in the
military. But because he served in 1956-57, he is not eligible for
post membership.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution urges the Legion to pressure its national
committeemen and members of Congress to change the charter. There's
some concern that Congress might not want to make vet's lobby even
stronger, DeLorenzi and other commanders say.
</P>
<P>
   The national leadership has taken no position on the issue
raised by Post 163, said Joe March, spokesman for the Legion's
national adjutant, Bob Spanogle, in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The number of veterans who served since W.W. II is about 26
million, March said. Of them, 19 million may join the Legion.
</P>
<P>
   The goal now is to sign up more of those 19 million, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things many people don't understand is that our
membership eligibility is set in stone by Congress,'' March said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Veterans of Foreign Wars is also charted by Congress,
it accepts only veterans who served served overseas in wartime.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, while peacetime veterans can't join, members of a
male component called Sons of the American Legion can participate
if they have a father who is an active Legion member, or a father,
grandfather or other direct family relative who served during
wartime.
</P>
<P>
   Women veterans can join the Legion, but DeLorenzi acknowledges
that the organization needs to straighten out its gender-based
components to reflect the modern military. But that's further down
the line.
</P>
<P>
   Around Puget Sound, some other commanders support Post 163's
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be great to include the peacetime veterans,''
said Walt DeLong, a 24-year Navy veteran and commander of West
Seattle's American Legion Post 160. ``They served their time. Why
should they be cut out because their service was for three or four
years between wars?''

CLIMB TO PGR TOUR IS STEEP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Golfer Kyle Kovacs can fill you in on all the details of his
dream in just about 15 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You start out on Monday qualifying for the Buy.com Tour,''
said Kovacs, 24, a 1993 graduate of Notre Dame High. ``You've got
two or three hundred guys going for 14 spots, but you get in, do
well in the tournament and get some experience at that level.
</P>
<P>
   ``You keep playing well there and eventually you get a win. Then
you get another, and another, and then you're in the top 15 on the
money list and you've got an automatic spot on the PGA Tour. That's
how quickly you can make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kovacs relays all this information without even as much as a
snicker. He's serious, because he has to be.
</P>
<P>
   For Kovacs, and thousands of other golfers who have yet to reach
the PGA Tour or are struggling to get back, they must believe in
themselves and their improbable dreams, even if few others do.
</P>
<P>
   They exist on the fringes of professional golf, some barely
getting by on their meager earnings from minitour events across the
country but all holding on to the dream that their path to fame and
fortune might soon be cleared.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of good players not on PGA out there, all over
the country and all over the world,'' said Brad Gallagher, 35, a
Saugus High graduate who now serves as an assistant pro at Robinson
Ranch in Santa Clarita after a decade on various minitours and
international circuits and 10 unsuccessful trips to PGA qualifying
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of guys out there with a lot of hope.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as Gallagher concedes, hope will only take a golfer so far.
Once the money runs out, the dream is over, and life in the minors
is never easy on the bank balance.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Zambri, a graduate of Westlake High and USC, along with
Alemany High alum David Berganio, now play on the Buy.com Tour
(formerly the Nike Tour), which is one significant cut below the
PGA Tour and an even more significant cut above the minitours that
Gallagher inhabited for several years.
</P>
<P>
   In an average week, Zambri will spend $110 to register for the
tournament, $300-$500 for a caddy and $250-$500 for a hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that doesn't include one meal,'' Zambri said.
</P>
<P>
   If a player misses a cut, there is no paycheck. In last
weekend's Buy.com tour event in Lakeland, Fla., former PGA Tour
player Bob Lohr made the cut, finished last, won $1,060 and likely
lost money on the week.
</P>
<P>
   Zambri earned some breathing room last weekend when he tied for
seventh place and earned a check for $12,050, by far his biggest of
the year, but that only lifted him to 52nd on the tour's money
list.
</P>
<P>
   Zambri regularly drives his minivan to tour stops, saving on
travel expenses, but he spends the majority of his time away from
his wife, Kim, and their 2-year-old son in Westlake Village.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been driving the whole tour,'' Zambri said. ``It's nice
to have your car out on tour, because if you don't play well, you
want to get the heck out of town. . . . If I miss a cut, then you
have to change your flight and that costs money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hard part is not seeing my family. If I didn't have a tie
with home, I wouldn't mind it. Being away from California doesn't
bug me. Being away from my family bugs me.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider also that Buy.com Tour events pay considerably more
than minitours, which means that for many players, golf is not a
sport as much as it is a mechanism for survival. Gallagher
estimated that only the top 10 percent of minitour players make
money during any given week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Buy.com Tour is one of the few places where you can play
full-time and still be comfortable financially,'' Kovacs said.
``I've built myself a decent cushion on the minitours, but not many
players in California can say that. It's not a lot of money, but
it's enough to get by.''
</P>
<P>
   It's enough for some, maybe, but not for all. Gallagher stopped
playing the minitours and accepted the job at Robinson Ranch, which
opened earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher once had eight birdies in one round during a Canadian
Tour event and also played in Asia and on several California tours,
including the Golden Bear and the Teardrop. But he decided that he
would be better off with the stability a full-time job.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher said he would like to get involved in the business end
of the PGA Tour and continue to play local sectional events when
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty tough out on the minitours,'' Gallagher said.
``You can play every week, but only if it doesn't eat up all your
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money used to be pretty good, because the fields were at
about 120 people every week. Now you might get 60 or 70, and where
there is less guys, there is less money.''
</P>
<P>
   The dream is still alive for some.
</P>
<P>
   Kovacs recently signed a sponsorship deal and will attempt to
qualify for Buy.com Tour events later this year, which is why he
daydreams about a quick path to the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   It appears he has the youth, ambition and talent to realize his
goal, but he understands that the opportunities are fleeting for
golfers in his situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago, you could start out on the PGA Tour and
learn while you were there,'' Kovacs said. ``Now, there is so much
competition that it's a fight just to get up to the tour.
</P>

CONTEMPT TRIAL CONCLUDES FOR STARR'S EX-SPOKESMAN
</HEADLINE>
  By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge said on Tuesday that she would
issue a verdict sometime next month in the criminal contempt case
against Charles G. Bakaly III, the former spokesman for the office
of independent counsel who is charged with lying to her about his
role as a source for an article in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   As the government and Bakaly's defense team made their final
arguments on Tuesday, Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, the chief judge
of the U.S. District Court here, asked both sides to provide
written summations by Aug. 11 that could serve as a foundation for
her verdict. She said she would probably deliver the verdict the
next week.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Bakaly could face up to six months in prison for
what government lawyers said was a series of lies about how much he
contributed to the article, which discussed whether President
Clinton could be indicted while in office.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Gershel, a Justice Department prosecutor, said in his
closing argument that Bakaly had misled Judge Johnson and
colleagues in his own office by trying to conceal some of the
information he had provided to the reporter who wrote the article,
Don Van Natta Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Gershel said that a sworn declaration Bakaly filed with Judge
Johnson in February 1999 was false in its assertion that he had
never disclosed any ``nonpublic material'' to the reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He allowed his falsehoods and lies to be built into his
declaration,'' Gershel said. ``These were lies upon lies, and like
a house of cards they eventually came tumbling down.''
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly's defense lawyer, Michele A. Roberts, tried to narrow the
focus of the case in her closing argument. She said the prosecutors
had raised issues that had nothing to do with the case, like
Bakaly's appearance on the ABC television show ``Good Morning
America'' the day after the article was published. Prosecutors had
shown a videotape of that show in which Bakaly denied that the
office of independent counsel was the source of the information in
the article.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said it was irrelevant to the criminal case if Bakaly's
statements to the interviewer on the show were misleading or
accurate. The only thing that mattered, she said, was the signed
declaration, which she argued was not deceptive.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said that Bakaly had tried to modify the declaration,
which was drafted by lawyers in the independent counsel's office.
But she said that while some of his suggested changes were
included, several were not.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not attempt to suggest that he provided no information
to Van Natta,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly is charged not with leaking secret material but with
making false and misleading statements to the judge about his role
as a source for the article. By doing so, the government has
charged, he caused the court and investigators to waste their time,
which amounts to an obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The Times article, published on Jan. 31, 1999, cited unnamed
associates of Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel, as saying
that he had concluded that he had the constitutional authority to
indict Clinton while he was in office. It also said that some
lawyers in Starr's office were in favor of indicting Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers complained to Judge Johnson that the story was
leaked by people in Starr's office to influence the impeachment
trial that was under way in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In response to that complaint, Starr's office filed a brief and
a declaration from Bakaly that asserted he had not provided any
nonpublic information to the reporter.
</P>
<P>
   After the declaration was filed, Bakaly gradually disclosed to
investigators from the Federal Bureau of Investigation that he had
provided the newspaper with some documents in connection with the
article. He also told investigators that he may have inadvertently
confirmed some information the reporter had told him he had learned
from sources outside the counsel's office.
</P>
<P>
   When the counsel's office learned of these later disclosures by
Bakaly about his dealings with the reporter, it informed Judge
Johnson that the original declaration was inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   At the trial, the FBI agents testified that Bakaly had told them
he wanted to send a message via the news article that the
investigation by the independent counsel would continue, despite
the impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The agents and Bakaly depicted a situation in which Bakaly
became more forthcoming about his role in contributing to the
article and only gradually began to realize that his comments were
making him a target of the agents' investigation.

   THE SENATE: CANDIDATE RESTORED TO BALLOT
</P>
<P>
   Jack E. Robinson III, the Republican U.S. Senate candidate who
had been bounced from the Massachusetts ballot in his challenge to
Edward M. Kennedy, has suddenly stopped looking quite so
beleaguered. The state's highest court ruled Tuesday that Robinson
could appear on the November ballot because he did in fact have the
10,000 signatures he needed to qualify. The court said a few dozen
signature forms that were printed upside-down should still be
counted. Robinson said that the decision would let him finally get
his campaign into full gear. He plans to push ahead with
fund-raising and organization-building, and to seek a
reconciliation with state Republican leaders who had disavowed him
earlier in the campaign as he was parrying accusations about his
past. His chances against the most prominent member of one of
America's best known political families in an overwhelmingly
Democratic state are still seen as slim.

   THE STATES: GORE TRAILS BUSH IN ARKANSAS
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton and Al Gore carried Clinton's home state of
Arkansas by comfortable margins in 1992 and 1996. But a new
Mason-Dixon poll conducted for The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette raises
some doubts whether Gore can continue the streak. It has Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas ahead 46 percent to 40 percent, with 11
percent undecided. ``A very disconcerting poll for Democrats,''
crowed Bush's Arkansas chairman, Sen. Tim Hutchinson. Gore's
chairman, state Attorney General Mark Pryor, countered: ``It's
encouraging for Gore because most of the undecided voters will back
him.'' The poll, conducted July 13 through 15, covered 622 likely
voters and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four
percentage points. &QL;

the Kennedys, has agreed to speak at the Democratic National
Convention in Los Angeles next month, 40 years after the party
nominated her father there. Her late brother, John F. Kennedy Jr.,
addressed the Democratic convention in 1988, and her uncle, Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, who will appear with her, is a

NONCANDIDATE MCCAIN IS STILL RUNNING HARD 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES BENNET   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain seems to be working harder at not
running for president than some guys _ we won't mention names _ do
in actually campaigning for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Since abandoning the race for the Republican nomination in
March, he has campaigned in so many states, for so many
congressional candidates and raised so much money, that his aides
have lost track of all three.
</P>
<P>
   And now, with a we're-puttin'-the-band-back-together mix of
nostalgia and anticipation, he is starting up his Straight Talk
Express to take himself, his old campaign team and about 60
journalists to the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia.
There, he plans to lead a town-hall meeting, hold a joint news
conference with MTV V-Js, make appearances on Comedy Central and
CBS News' ``Face the Nation,'' throw a party for 600 friends and so
on. To record the doings for ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' his
wife, Cindy, plans to carry the ``Cindy-cam.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying very hard not in any way to offend any of the Bush
people or overshadow what is clearly Governor Bush's event,''
McCain said in an interview Monday at his Senate office, where he
arrived illuminated by a CNN camera light.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to Gov. George W. Bush profess not to be offended in
the slightest. They say that McCain's star power can now only
benefit them, by drawing the attention of independent voters.
</P>
<P>
   If there is to be any dissent at the convention, which begins on
July 31, it is not likely to come from the scrappy Arizonan who
used to say of Bush that ``if he's a reformer, I'm an astronaut.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said that even when he appeared in Philadelphia on July
30 at a planned ``shadow convention,'' which will also feature
antagonists of the right like the comedian Al Franken, he will
promote Bush as devoted to ``reform of education, of the military,
of our strategic posture nuclear-weapons-wise, health care, etc.''
</P>
<P>
   Though they have spoken a few times by telephone, Bush and
McCain have not appeared together since May 9, when McCain endorsed
his former opponent in Pittsburgh. But McCain said in the interview
that he intends to campaign alongside Bush after the convention and
again in September and October.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCain seemed at times less than thrilled with his
bridesmaid's role. He looked down and spoke softly when asked to
describe his level of enthusiasm for Bush's candidacy. ``My
enthusiasm is very high,'' he said. In the interview, he became
animated only when discussing the high points of his campaign,
which he recalled with ``nostalgia and pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   At the staff level, resentment, if not contempt, lingers on both
sides, but the two camps are learning to work together. Sniping
that used to take place in the open, then anonymously, is now done
strictly in secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the true backbiting now is limited to completely
off-the-record, which is progress,'' said John Weaver, a wry
adviser to McCain. But, he said, ``You'll never see the two staffs
go on vacation together.''
</P>
<P>
   In his subdued tones, McCain praised Bush as running ``an
increasingly centrist campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   From Bush's perspective, the benefits of comity are obvious.
According to public polls, McCain remains more popular than Bush or
Vice President Al Gore, as the senator's aides are quick to point
out. He is particularly beloved by the swing groups of independent
and undecided voters needed by both candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Thomas M. Davis III of Virginia, who is leading the
Republican drive to retain the House, said that even party regulars
clamor for McCain. ``Now that he's no longer a threat, they've kind
of embraced him,'' he said. ``He's everywhere from Florida to
Mississippi to New Hampshire. He's the man.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said that he wants comity because he is a loyal
Republican. ``I was very concerned about, and should be concerned
about, giving the appearance of being a bad loser,'' McCain said.
``I don't think that's helpful to me, to Governor Bush, or to the
party. And frankly, I didn't want to  &UR; be  &LR; a bad loser.''
</P>
<P>
   After dropping out of the race, McCain formed a political action
committee, Straight Talk America, to promote his agenda. He is
creating a Center for Conservative Reform to add some intellectual
heft to it. His aides acknowledge that the PAC could serve as the
basis for a future presidential bid, should Bush stumble. But while
McCain said, after a long pause, that he did not know if he would
ever run for president again, he called the prospect unlikely. He
said he did not want to be picked as vice president and did not
expect to be.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's aides studied how failed Republican nominees, including
Ronald Reagan in 1976, approached the party's conventions. But they
took more cues from the supportive role that Gen. Colin L. Powell
played in 1996. After first receiving the go-ahead from the Bush
camp, Andrew Card, the co-chairman of the convention, invited
McCain to speak at the convention during a meeting on June 20. He
said he told McCain that he was seeking ``political celebrities,''
not politicians.
</P>
<P>
   McCain does not plan to deliver anything like the jeremiad Pat
Buchanan delivered at the 1992 convention, when he rallied the
party to religious and cultural ``war'' and helped sink the
re-election bid of Bush's father. McCain's speech, scheduled for
10:30 on the convention's second night, will be devoted to Bush's
chosen theme, ``Strength and Security With a Purpose,'' and will
probably not even mention the senator's signature issue, campaign
finance reform, aides said. No one asked McCain to show his speech
to the convention organizers ahead of time, according to all
parties, but he plans to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Card said that, while McCain's bus trip was not part of the plan
for the convention, there was ``no danger'' of Bush being upstaged.
McCain will not even be in the audience when Bush accepts the
nomination. He plans to leave on the convention's third day,
Wednesday morning _ a sign not of pique, organizers and supporters
insist, but of self-abnegation.

MERRILL LYNCH TO CUT ABOUT 1,800 JOBS IN BROKERAGE BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grappling with slowing growth in its brokerage business, Merrill
Lynch &AMP; Co. officials said Tuesday that the firm would eliminate
about 1,800 jobs, mostly at its operations in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   An internal announcement of the cuts, most of which are expected
in the next few weeks, came after Merrill announced that its
second-quarter earnings rose 34 percent, despite a slim increase in
revenue from commissions and slower growth in the amount of money
customers invested at the firm. Merrill took in just $11 billion in
new money from customers in the United States, less than half the
$26 billion in net new assets reported by the rival brokerage firm
Charles Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   All told, Schwab took in $37 billion in assets last quarter, but
about $11 billion of that came through U.S. Trust Corp., a New
York-based money management firm that Schwab bought this year.
Excluding charges related to acquisitions, Schwab's operating
income rose 17 percent, to $198.8 million, or 14 cents a diluted
share, from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Like Schwab, Merrill recorded its second-biggest quarterly
profit, after an extraordinary first quarter. But Merrill's
earnings gain was driven by increases in stock trading and
underwriting and fees from advising on mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill earned $902 million, or $2.01 a diluted share, up from
$673 million, or $1.57 a share, in the second quarter of 1999.
Though down 15 percent from the first quarter of 2000, Merrill's
earnings easily exceeded analysts' expectation of $1.70 a share,
according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill also said that it would split its shares 2-for-1 next
month and the firm raised its quarterly dividend 7 percent, to 32
cents a share. Shares of Merrill Lynch, which have risen 53.9
percent this year, fell $3.75 on Tuesday, to $128.25.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Moszkowski, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said
Merrill's performance showed that ``the downturn has been more
shallow in the trading and investment banking business than you
might expect.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the brokerage business, he said, ``Schwab's inflows were
extremely strong compared to Merrill's.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the employees of Merrill's brokerage operations
Tuesday afternoon, E. Stanley O'Neal, who runs that unit, said
changes had to be made because brokerage expenses were rising 25
percent this year, while revenue was increasing at a 15-percent
clip.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal told the employees that 900 full-time jobs in the
brokerage unit would be eliminated beginning this week. Another 400
people who work for the firm as consultants and independent
contractors will also lose their jobs and about 500 jobs will be
eliminated through attrition. The job cuts amount to about 5
percent of the unit's 37,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   He said the cuts would affect all segments of the brokerage
operation, which is based in Plainsboro, N.J., but would have
little effect in the branch offices. None of Merrill's 15,200
brokers will be laid off.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill's chief financial officer, Thomas Patrick, said Merrill
hoped to reduce its costs by more than $150 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   While Merrill's employees were dealing with the firm's second
round of layoffs in less than two years, workers at Schwab were
cheering their firm's proven ability to attract assets even when
the stock market is in turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the sharp sell-off in technology stocks in April, Schwab
attracted 400,000 accounts and lost about 200,000. Its customers'
trading activity declined sharply, to 288,000 trades a day, from
386,600 trades a day in the first quarter. And the average
commission it received on each of those trades continued to slide,
to $36.65 from $46.44.
</P>
<P>
   Including the operations of U.S. Trust and Cybercorp, an online
trading unit it acquired this year, Schwab had total revenue of
$1.4 billion, up 26 percent from $1.12 billion a year ago. But its
net income dropped 20 percent to $137 million, or 9 cents a diluted
share, from $170 million, or 12 cents a share, a year ago.

COURT STRIKES FEDERAL RULES FOR PHONE COMPANY PRICES  
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH SCHIESEL    
 c. 2000 N.Y. Times News Service     
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal appeals court Tuesday struck down Federal
Communications Commission pricing rules for telephone companies
intended to foster competition in local communications markets.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC could ask the Supreme Court to review the decision. But
if the ruling stands, it may mean long-distance giants and newer
companies will have to pay millions of dollars in additional
network-connection costs because it could increase the fees that
companies pay for connecting to the networks of local carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a nutshell, I think this means these rates will go up,''
William P. Barr, the former attorney general who is Verizon's
general counsel, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the government required
incumbent local phone companies _ not only the Bells but also
carriers like GTE and Southern New England Telecommunications _ to
open their networks to outside competitors. The FCC came up with a
system to determine what the incumbents could charge competitors
for using the necessary elements of their networks to provide local
service that requires the incumbents to charge as if they used the
most efficient, technically advanced communications equipment on
the market.
</P>
<P>
   But the incumbent phone giants protested that the rate system
was unfair and that the prices they were allowed to charge were in
some cases below their actual costs. The incumbents argued that
they should be able to charge fees based on their actual costs, not
the costs of a hypothetical network.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a three-judge panel for the 8th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals Appeals, in St. Louis, agreed with the local carriers,
saying that the FCC rules violated the communications act itself.
The decision would not take effect for 45 days. An FCC official
said a decision on whether to ask for a stay and whether to appeal
the ruling could come within weeks.

BUSH SAYS GOVERNMENT SHOULD HELP FATHERS BE RESPONSIBLE

 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Gov. George W. Bush extolled the importance of
fatherhood Tuesday, lamenting the prevalence of children growing up
without the guidance of both parents and saying that he would
direct the federal government to spend more money to coax fathers
toward responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The amount he was talking about, $40 million a year, was small,
and the goal he was articulating was anything but controversial.
</P>
<P>
   But part of Bush's prescription, allowing the money to go to
groups that use religion in their efforts to unite fathers with
their families, illustrated a philosophy that has raised questions
about the separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   Bush talked about this approach during a panel discussion at a
private agency in Milwaukee, Faith Works, that incorporates
religion into its efforts to rehabilitate fathers with drug and
alcohol problems and guide them into schools and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faith does work,'' Bush said in Milwaukee Tuesday morning,
before he headed here for several campaign events. ``It's a
powerful concept. It's not a government concept, by the way. It
recognizes that there are powers greater than mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said that while the federal government should do its
part to help finance such efforts, it should recognize ``programs
that exist in spite of government, that help people who may be
coming out of prison, to help them find work, but also remind folks
of the importance of being a dad.''
</P>
<P>
   A description of Bush's proposed policy distributed by his
campaign aides said that most of the money would be directed by the
federal Department of Health and Human Services toward groups,
including those affiliated with churches, that help low-income
fathers find work and promote being responsible parents.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's proposal and the setting in which he unveiled it, an
inner-city agency that serves many African-Americans, were intended
to bolster his portrayal of himself as a ``different kind of
Republican'' with special concern for underprivileged people.
</P>
<P>
   The event also underscored the occasional exhortations by Bush,
who considers himself a devout Christian, for Americans to
rediscover the benefits of more traditional mores. So did the words
of one of the other panelists.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Joyce, who helps raise private money for faith-based
programs, said that Tuesday morning's event would have been
unimaginable a decade ago, when ``Murphy Brown,'' a television
comedy, ``taught elites that they could raise children without
having a dad in the house.'' The comment alluded to former Vice
President Dan Quayle's complaint at the time that the show exalted
single motherhood.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce hailed the progress that he said had been made since then,
and said that it certainly could not be attributed to ``the
example, say, of the leader of the free world, in terms of parental
virtue.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore has also advocated a role for religious
organizations in providing social services, with certain caveats.
But he has not pushed this approach as aggressively as Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush left Milwaukee and arrived here around midday to address
the National Conference of State Legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   He was introduced, at his campaign's request, by the Democratic
speaker of the Texas House, Pete Laney, an arrangement the Texas
governor said was an indication of the bipartisan spirit he had
brought to government in his state.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Bush attended a dinner here that was expected to raise
about $3 million for the Republican Party.

INTEL LOGS 80% RISE IN NET AND BIG REVENUE GROWTH  
</HEADLINE>
   By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Intel Corp., the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer,
reported record second-quarter earnings Tuesday, largely because of
gains on investments. But to Wall Street's relief, the company also
reported revenue growth that was stronger than expected and it
narrowly beat expectations for earnings from its products and
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a blowout like some of the other tech stocks have
had, but it's not bad,'' said Joseph Osha, who follows the sector
for Merrill Lynch Global Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Intel said it earned $3.14 billion, or 45 cents a diluted share,
in the quarter ended June 30, up almost 80 percent from $1.75
billion, or 25 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. But
after using the technology sector's increasingly common convention
of adjusting for accounting provisions connected to various
acquisitions, earnings were 50 cents a share for the quarter, a
penny more than the consensus of analysts, according to First
Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue jumped 23 percent, to $8.30 billion, from just under
$6.75 billion in the second quarter of 1999. The figures were
especially impressively, analysts said, because the second quarter
is normally slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw strong demand in all business groups,'' said Craig R.
Barrett, president and chief executive of Intel, which is based in
Santa Clara, Calif. ``Looking forward, we expect to see strong
demand continue into the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts, Intel officials projected
that sales would be ``up'' and then, in case anyone missed the
optimism, noted that in the past they had often qualified such
projections with adjectives like ``slightly.''
</P>
<P>
   The results for the quarter and previous periods were restated
to reflect Intel's previously announced 2-for-1 stock split,
effective on July 30. The earnings were announced after the close
of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, in which Intel shares
fell $3.3125, to $143. In after-hours trading, the shares rose as
high as $147.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel seems to be on a solid track going forward,'' said
Jonathan Joseph, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's performance this year has been hampered by its inability
to produce as much as customers want to buy. Those constraints are
expected to ease in the second half as new capacity comes on line
and Intel introduces its Pentium 4 chip, which has been developed
under the code name Willamette. But Intel said inventories were
still lower than it wanted and declined to assure analysts that
supplies would come into balance with demand before the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   The increased profits in the second quarter included $2.1
billion from Intel's sale of investments in Micron Technology and
other companies. Intel has contended that such gains should be
included in its regular earnings, since the practice of making
strategic investments in smaller companies has become just as
routine a feature of Intel's business as making microchips.
</P>
<P>
   Many other technology companies and a number of banks are also
deriving substantial contributions to earnings from their
investment activities. Intel said Tuesday that its Intel Capital
unit held stakes worth $7.5 billion in 450 companies at the end of
the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts are concerned, though, that investment earnings
can swing widely from quarter to quarter depending on when a
company sells investment shares and how the market is performing.
In fact, the earnings reported Tuesday were close to Wall Street's
projections only because analysts scrambled last month to adjust
their estimates after the company warned them that the investment
gains would be more than triple the $725 million it had previously
offered as guidance. Intel projected that such income would drop
back to about $800 million in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The second-quarter results were negatively affected by a
one-time charge of $200 million, or 2 cents a share, for the costs
of a program that began in the first quarter to replace defective
Pentium III circuit boards.

-- Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim  guerrillas who forced Israel from
the slice of southern Lebanon it had occupied for 22 years, grew from
a small band of amateurish gunmen to a highly sophisticated tactical
operation savvy enough to exploit a new weapon of modern warfare --
television. "The use of media as a weapon had an effect parallel to a
battle," says the top Hezbollah commander in southern Lebanon, Sheik
Nabil Quok. Quok, in a rare interview with a Western journalist
discussed not only how Hezbollah learned to improve its

"Big Pussy" who came to a briny end this season, sent to sleep with
the fishes by his best friend, Tony, on the HBO cult hit "The
Sopranos." Regarding the Mafia, it's hedge time: he doesn't recommend
the lifestyle, but since it's an indirect provider of his lifestyle,
don't ask him to take potshots. Besides, he's kind of connected, and
says he can't go anyplace -- not even backstage at Springsteen --
without bumping into somebody from the five families. "They, uh,
always want to meet you if you've played somebody they know," says
Pastore outside the Westbank Cafe on 42nd Street in Manhattan.

allowances for just about every form of misconduct. The new

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ The White House described the scene inside Camp
David on Tuesday as one of little sleep and unwavering intensity,
with President Clinton negotiating until dawn with Prime Minister
Ehud Barak of Israel and then, after just a few hours' sleep,
meeting with the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Informally, officials were suggesting that Clinton's artificial
deadline of Wednesday morning, when he is scheduled to leave for
Japan, could be stretched as much as 21 hours, an element of
information that added to a steadily building drama.
</P>
<P>
   At times on Tuesday, it seemed the impossible might be possible:
an agreement on all the issues, including Jerusalem. At other
times, the temperature receded back to the more sober expectation
of a rather modest agreement and a second summit meeting before
Arafat's Sept. 13 deadline for declaring a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Haaretz newspaper in Israel reported in its Wednesday paper that
negotiations were focused on what the paper described as a package
of American-mediated proposals on the ``core issues of borders,
refugees and Jerusalem.'' The paper said Arafat had yet to approve
the proposals, implying that Israel had.
</P>
<P>
   The article said that under these proposals Jerusalem would
remain united under Israeli sovereignty, that major settlements on
the West Bank would be annexed by Israel and that Palestinian
refugees could return to Israel only for family reunifications and
without Israel accepting any responsibility for their original
expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the account said, Israel would agree to ``broad
autonomy'' for Palestinians in East Jerusalem, and to accept some
one hundred thousand Palestinian refugees into Israel. According to
this report, Israel could end the summit meeting with a ``partial
accord,'' which would include its recognition of a Palestinian
state.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment on the report from negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   But members of the Israeli delegation have called home in the
last 24 hours, leaking news that the question of Jerusalem had been
under discussion since Monday and hinting at progress on this most
intractable issue.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Arafat was reported to have called his headquarters
in Gaza and told his aides to spread the word that he was
considering packing his bags and leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides were playing to their constituents, and preparing
public opinion for posssible outcomes. Arafat, presumably, was
showing that he was not going to give up on his long-held stance
that East Jerusalem must be the capital of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the same script, Barak was demonstrating that he was
a man of reason, and was prepared as Israel television reported
Tuesday night to make ``unprecedented steps'' toward the
Palestinian position on Jerusalem. If an agreement were not reached
on the future status of Jerusalem, Barak would be able to say that
he had tried his best and that the Palestinians were unmovable.
</P>
<P>
   But that Jerusalem was on the table was itself progress over the
seven-year time line of negotiations between the Palestinians and
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was astonished by the degree of progress in the last few
hours,'' said an Israeli who was in contact with the delegation by
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Only several months ago, Jerusalem was a virtually taboo subject
in back-channel talks in Stockholm, where the top negotiators of
Arafat and Barak met and made progress on a variety of issues.
These included what might constitute the territorial boundaries of
a Palestinian state and what would be the fate of the 3 million
Palestinian refugees scattered across the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   But on Jerusalem, there was only generalized talk in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   According to reports attributed to Israeli officials, the
Israeli delegation at Camp David was presenting a plan that would
incorporate the Israeli bedroom communities that are now a de facto
part of the capital into the legal entity of Jerusalem. Among the
West Bank settlements near Jerusalem being mentioned are Maale
Advmim and Givat Zeev.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also calls for areas populated by Palestinians, such as
Beit Hanina and the Shuafat refugee camp, to be placed under
Palestinian control. The moves together would provide more
demographic balance in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   But this version of a solution for Jerusalem leaves unanswered
the top concerns of Arafat, who has insisted all along that East
Jerusalem, annexed by the Israelis in the 1967 war, should be the
capital of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   From the Palestinian point of view, the Israeli plan does not
deal with the heart of the matter: it leaves under Israeli
sovereignty the Old City of Jerusalem, home of the main religious
sites of Judaism, Islam and Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   There have also been reports that Arafat has stood firm on
Jerusalem, insisting that no agreement can come out of these
negotiations without Palestinian control over the Al Aqsa Mosque
and the Church of the Holy Sepulcher.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's spokesman, Joe Lockhart, stood studiously above the
fray on the issue of Jerusalem. He did not utter the word Jerusalem
or mention any of the other substantive matters, such as
Palestinian refugees or the boundaries of a new Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, through the release of bits of minutae on who was
meeting with whom or who was not meeting with whom, he depicted
Clinton as a president waiting to do some down-to-the-line
persuasion.
</P>
<P>
   Now into the eighth day, the negotiations have produced a
roller-coaster of emotions, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go through various emotions, ranging from moments where
you see promise, to moments where the only thing you see is
frustration,'' Lockhart said. ``Not only the president, the leaders
and all the delegations, have run the entire range over the last
eight days.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that the technique of ostentatiously threatening to walk
out has been used in the past _ Anwar el Sadat of Egypt packed his
bags at Camp David 22 years ago, and Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel
did the same at Wye, Md., three years ago _ Lockhart was asked if a
similar approach had been made this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that I know of,'' Lockhart said. ``It would be a long
walk. You've got to go all the way down the mountain.''

LAZIO BUYS $1.6 MILLION IN TV ADS IN RACE'S FIRST 6 WEEKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the first six weeks after he abruptly entered the
Senate race, Rep. Rick Lazio spent $1.58 million on television
advertising, and sought to bolster his candidacy by hiring several
political consultants who had worked on Sen. John McCain's failed
presidential bid, according to campaign records released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The records, which the Lazio campaign filed with the Federal
Election Commission and released to reporters, show that Lazio
collected $4.99 million in donations from April 1 through June 30,
nearly all of it after becoming a candidate after Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani withdrew in mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio spent a total of $2.32 million, and his campaign now has
$6.19 million in the bank, including money left over from his House
races.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign of Lazio's Democratic opponent, Hillary Rodham
Clinton, did not release her records Tuesday, saying it would do so
later in the week. This month, the Clinton campaign said it had
raised $5.1 million from April 1 through June 30, and spent $5.49
million, leaving her with $6.4 million on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Before April 1, Clinton had already spent $6.12 million, meaning
that so far in this campaign, she has raised $17.9 million and
spent $11.61 million. Even with the departure of Giuliani, who had
set a fund-raising record, the campaign is likely to be one of the
most expensive in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   In stepping in for Giuliani, who dropped out to focus on his
treatment for prostate cancer, Lazio did not adopt much of the
Giuliani campaign apparatus, the records suggest. The Lazio
campaign did spend $4,000 buying computer equipment and mailing
lists from the Giuliani campaign, but established its own office in
midtown Manhattan _ Giuliani's had been downtown _ paying $12,198
for rent and another $15,372 for furniture.
</P>
<P>
   And instead of keeping the Giuliani staff, Lazio turned to
veterans of the McCain campaign, the records indicate. Lazio spent
several thousand dollars hiring Campaign Services Group, a firm
headed by John Weaver, one of McCain's former strategists, as well
as two other McCain consultants, Amy Griffith and Keith Nahigian.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio also brought on another former McCain strategist, Michael
Murphy, and some of Murphy's associates. A Lazio campaign
spokesman, Dan McLagan, is another former McCain campaign aide.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the advertising expenditures, Lazio focused heavily on
direct mail fund-raising solicitations, hoping to emulate
Giuliani's extraordinary success in collecting donations from
people around the country who dislike Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio hired a prominent Republican fund-raising company, SCM
Associates of New Hampshire, spending $183,412, according to the
documents. The campaign also paid $20,156 to Econtributor.com,
which handles online fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   The filings also show that the Lazio campaign returned a $2,000
contribution from Christopher Quick, a former executive of Quick &AMP;
Reilly, the brokerage company. The Securities and Exchange
Commission is investigating whether Lazio had inside information
before he bought options in Quick &AMP; Reilly stock in 1997, which
yielded him roughly $13,500, a nearly 600 percent profit, in less
than seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Quick &AMP; Reilly, which is now a division of
FleetBoston Financial, have been among Lazio's biggest supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Quick donated $2,000 to the Lazio campaign on June 15, just as
he was being questioned by reporters about Lazio's option's trade.
(Quick said he had not discussed the company's stock with Lazio.)
</P>
<P>
   On June 30, the Lazio campaign returned the $2,000 because it
was over the limit. Quick had already donated $2,000, the maximum,
on June 28, 1999.

 NEW YORK'S LABOR LEADERS BACK McCALL FOR GOVERNOR  
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In what labor leaders are calling a powerful
signal that they intend to support state Comptroller H. Carl McCall
for governor in 2002, nearly all of New York's top union officials
will hold a fund-raiser for him Thursday in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said it was far too soon for them or their unions to
make formal endorsements. But several of them, asking that their
names not be used, added that they expected, even intended,
Thursday's event to be taken as an early sign of e their
sympathies. ``We'd elect him tomorrow,'' one prominent union leader
said.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials said that it was highly unusual to hold an event
with so many big labor names so far from the election, adding that
they could not imagine doing so for the man who might be McCall's
top opponent in a Democratic primary, Andrew Cuomo, the federal
housing secretary.
</P>
<P>
   McCall has said he will not make a formal announcement of his
plans until after the November elections, but he has made an
unusually early start at laying the groundwork for a run for
governor and lining up the support of a large number of elected
officials, and his aides say he is clearly running.
</P>
<P>
   He could have a bruising primary against Cuomo and, should he
win, the comptroller could face a daunting challenge in taking on
Gov. George Pataki, a popular Republican incumbent with an
impressive political and fund-raising operation. The governor has
said he expects to seek a third term.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether Thursday's event marks the
beginning of a wholesale shift for the state's labor unions, which
have taken pains not to clash with Pataki. Most remained neutral in
the 1998 race, when it was clear throughout that Pataki would
easily win re-election, depriving the Democratic nominee, Peter F.
Vallone, of what is usually his party's most potent ally.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo's and Pataki's offices did not return calls Tuesday
seeking comment. Cuomo has said he might run for governor, though
there has been talk of his taking another high-level Washington job
if Vice President Al Gore wins the presidency. Cuomo has said that
plenty of time remains for him to decide about 2002 and that he is
perplexed by McCall's early start.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the lineup of sponsors for Thursday's even means that
he would have strong labor support in a run for governor, McCall
said, ``Somebody could certainly infer that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would send a signal to anybody that as far as labor
is concerned, that I seem to have a good head start in terms of
lining up labor support,'' he said. ``That means that support would
probably not be there for someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Suzy Ballantyne, political director of the state AFL-CIO, said,
``It's a little early for us to be making endorsements, but what I
think what you can read into it is Carl McCall has a great deal of
support in the labor movement for his current plans and future
plans.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall has long been a favorite of unions for his handling of
the state pension funds, including protecting them from attempted
raids by lawmakers. His stature within organized labor rose
significantly this year after the Legislature passed and Pataki
signed into law a bill giving automatic cost-of-living increases,
or COLAs, to retired state and local government workers for the
first time, a caus the comptroller championed for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The COLA has really solidified what was already very strong
labor appreciation for Carl McCall, and I don't think that Andrew
has a similar issue that is as transcendent that he can point to,''
said Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of
Teachers and one of the sponsors of the fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   The amount organizers expect to raise from Thursday's reception
at the carpenters' union hall, something over $100,000, is
relatively modest, as is the price of admission, $1,000. An
individual can contribute more than $30,000 to a gubernatorial
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Invitations to the event list 48 co-chairman, including top
officials of the state AFL-CIO; District Council 37, the New York
City employees' umbrella group; New York State United Teachers; the
Transport Workers Union; the Civil Service Employees Association;
the International Brotherhood of Teamsters; the Communications
Workers of America; and UNITE, the garment workers' union.
</P>
<P>
   The only notable absence from the list is that of Dennis Rivera,
president of 1199, the hospital workers' union, who is probably the
state's most politically potent labor official. Rivera is known for
hedging his bets politically and has worked hard at building good
relations with state Republicans. Last year, he played a central
role in negotiating with the governor on a new health care program
for the working poor.

EDITORIAL: LEAVING ENVIRONMENTAL LAW ALONE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: W. Va.)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, July 19:
</P>
<P>
   Today is the final day for public comment on a proposed rule
change in the Clean Water Act that would allow the environmentally
destructive practice called mountaintop-removal mining, common in
the coal-bearing regions of the Southeast, to continue unimpeded.
In mountaintop-removal mining, the soil and rock above a coal seam
are dumped into hollows and streambeds.
</P>
<P>
   Last October a federal judge in West Virginia ruled that the
practice violated the Clean Water Act, which says that mining and
other wastes cannot be used as ``fill material'' in waterways.
Instead of defending the law, the Environmental Protection Agency
proposed to change the definition of ``fill material'' to eliminate
that part of the rule barring the use of waste. This in effect
gives the Army Corps of Engineers, which issues fill permits under
the Clean Water Act, the authority to bury streams and estuaries
with waste.
</P>
<P>
   The change is opposed by environmentalists and moderate
Republicans, including Rick Lazio, who are furious at the
administration for weakening its generally reliable support of the
Clean Water Act. Through an aide, Hillary Clinton, Lazio's opponent
in the New York Senate race, has said that she too opposes the
change in environmental rules. She and Lazio contest the change not
because they need to take a stand on mountaintop mining in West
Virginia, but because it would expose waters all across the United
States to the dumping of waste. The EPA argues that by altering the
definition of ``fill'' to include waste it is merely legalizing
current practice in the coal mining industry. But the better way to
make coal mining conform with the law is to leave the law alone and
end mountaintop removal, which has destroyed 1,000 miles of streams
in West Virginia alone.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's stand can be understood only in the
narrowest political sense. Mining that dumps waste into hollows and
valleys has expanded considerably during the past 10 years, and one
of the states in which it is most prevalent _ West Virginia _ is
represented by the powerful and agelessly influential Democratic
senator Robert Byrd. But by pursuing this rule change _ by
authorizing the dumping of waste into living waters _ the
administration has involved itself in a fatal contradiction,
claiming to support the Clean Water Act while also undercutting it.
What the act needs is not revision. It is enforcement. &QL;

 REGION BRACES FOR SPRAYING TO BATTLE THE WEST NILE VIRUS By SARAH c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As residents of Staten Island braced themselves on
Tuesday for spraying with the pesticide Anvil in response to signs
of West Nile virus, Westchester County officials announced that
they would also begin spraying the chemical on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very difficult decision personally for me to
make,'' Andrew J. Spano, the Westchester County executive, said at
a news conference on Tuesday after a pool of mosquitoes had tested
positive for the disease. ``We want to reduce the use of pesticides
in the county, and I have said over and over again it was our goal
to avoid having to use them.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement in Westchester, a suburban county north of New
York City, came a day after city officials announced that they
would begin spraying Staten Island starting Wednesday night because
two dead crows had tested positive for the virus, which the
authorities said sickened 62 people in the New York region last
year, killing 7.
</P>
<P>
   In the city, where the outbreak began last year in Queens, no
mosquitoes have tested positive for the virus, and there have been
no reports of illness in humans anywhere this summer.
</P>
<P>
   In Suffolk County on Long Island, where infected birds and
mosquitoes were found, spraying of Anvil and another pesticide,
Scourge, began Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City and in Westchester, officials will use trucks
to spray Anvil, part of a class of pesticides known as synthetic
pyrethroids, which mimic the natural pesticide produced by
chrysanthemum flowers. Scourge, a pesticide from the same family,
may also be used if more spraying is needed in other parts of the
city, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   For the residents of Staten Island, news that their
neighborhoods would be sprayed was greeted with a mixture of relief
and worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spray could hurt people, but it could also help people,''
said Angela Amari, 36. ``The virus is something a perfectly healthy
person could become extremely sick with. It's a double-edged
sword.''
</P>
<P>
   Several environmental experts said the pesticides being used
tended to have fewer health effects on humans than Malathion, the
pesticide that was used during an aerial spraying campaign last
year that drew vociferous opposition from environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   In April, city officials said they would no longer use
Malathion, which affects the central nervous system in mosquitoes
and, in large enough doses, in humans.
</P>
<P>
   The synthetic pyrethroids ``are generally not as potent or toxic
chemicals to humans,'' said Steven Johnson, the Environmental
Protection Agency's deputy administrator for the office of
prevention, pesticides and toxic substances.
</P>
<P>
   Still, health and environmental officials said the pesticides
could aggravate respiratory problems like asthma in people and
could also cause minor skin, throat and eye irritations.
</P>
<P>
   Officials encouraged residents to stay indoors and keep their
pets inside during the spraying hours, keep windows closed and
air-conditioners, which could allow the pesticide to enter their
homes, turned off. Residents are also urged to wash any toys or
equipment left outside before use.
</P>
<P>
   In Westchester, spraying of every road across half the county,
covering New Rochelle, Eastchester, Tuckahow, Bronxville,
Mamaroneck, Scarsdale, North Castle, Mount Pleasant, New Castle,
Pleasantville, Mount Kisco, Pound Ridge, Lewisboro and Bedford, was
scheduled for 11:30 p.m. Thursday to 4:30 a.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On Staten Island, spraying is scheduled for 10 p.m. Wednesday to
5 a.m. Thursday in a two-mile radius of where the dead crows were
found, encompassing the Rossville and Westerleigh sections of the
borough.

EDITORIAL: A PRO-CHOICE CHANCE FOR BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, July 19:
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom that the Republican ticket can never
include a pro-choice vice-presidential candidate seems to be
eroding. That is a good sign for the party's long-ignored moderate
wing and for those who would like to see the Northeast play a
stronger role in the GOP. The party's expected nominee, Gov. George
W. Bush, ought to look closely at this chance to show that he has
the spine to stand up to the intimidators from the religious right,
a faction that exerted an outsized influence during his father's
administration. By selecting a pro-choice running mate, Bush would
also be pulling the party more into alignment with suburban
moderates who in numerical terms are more important to the GOP than
the anti-abortion movement.
</P>
<P>
   As Richard Berke reported in The New York Times, most lists of
pro-choice running mates include Govs. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania
and George Pataki of New York. The presidential nominee's brother,
Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, said he was dreaming of a ticket with
Gen. Colin Powell, who is pro-choice. Such is Powell's popularity
that his selection would silence all but the most militant
pro-lifers.
</P>
<P>
   But former President Gerald Ford suggested that it should not
take a dream ticket to embolden his party to stand up to its
militant wing. Ford singled out Ridge as the kind of ``responsible
pro-choice candidate'' who could strengthen the ticket. Ridge and
Pataki have in common the fact that they come from states with big
electoral votes. Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey has probably
been dropped from the list of pro-choice alternatives because of
her ill-considered frisking of a black man being held by state
police.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Bush will hear warnings that anti-abortion forces could
desert the party and even disrupt the convention if he defies them.
Bolder advisers might argue that in his recent appearances,
including his visit to the NAACP convention, Bush has attempted to
reach beyond normal Republican territory. His political statements
on education and Social Security also show Bush attempting to label
himself as a more flexible and independent-minded kind of
Republican. A pro-choice running mate would reassure swing voters
who worry that Bush is a pleasant man with a secret hard-line
agenda. Such voters would surely be impressed if Bush could get Pat
Robertson and others in the Christian right to hold still for a
running mate with some pro-choice credentials.
</P>
<P>
   That would still leave the GOP with a presidential nominee and a
platform opposed to abortion. It would also mean that after years
of talking about the ``big tent,'' the GOP is ready to respect the
views as well as use the votes of Republicans who do not march in
lockstep with the religious right and the anti-abortion movement. &QL;

EDITORIAL: CELL PHONES AND SAFETY 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, July 19:
</P>
<P>
   There was a lot of debate about the safety implications of car
radios when they were developed over 70 years ago. A similar debate
is under way now about the use of hand-held cell phones in cars. On
the face of it, cell phones are a much bigger potential distraction
than radios. They require more concentration by the driver and tie
up one hand that ought to be on the steering wheel.
</P>
<P>
   A few small American municipalities, most recently Marlboro,
N.J., have banned the use of hand-held cell phones by drivers.
While the matter may require more research, our instinct is that
Marlboro and the other communities are on the right track. We would
go so far as to recommend state legislation to guarantee
uniformity.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began public
hearings yesterday on cell phone use in cars. There are 91 million
mobile phone subscribers, and 85 percent of them say they
occasionally talk on their phones while driving. The potential for
distraction, even disaster, is obvious. A 1997 Canadian study
published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the
risk of an accident increases fourfold if the driver is on a cell
phone. But it cautioned that the findings suggest an association,
not a causal relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Few state or local governments tabulate statistics on cell phone
use as a factor in traffic accidents. They should start doing so. A
statistical analysis persuaded Japanese government officials that
cell phones were in fact responsible for traffic violations and
accidents and ultimately led to a ban. Congress could usefully
underwrite similar studies in this country.
</P>
<P>
   One technological answer could be hands-free or voice-activated
cell phones, which are growing in popularity. But the Canadian
study suggested that these phones do not confer a safety advantage
over hand-held units.
</P>
<P>
   So far 13 countries, including Britain, Italy and Australia,
have banned cell phone use while driving. That is not reason enough
to ban them here. But common sense suggests that the matter
deserves, at the very least, serious and comprehensive study, aimed
not at delaying action but promoting a sensible response.

EARNINGS AT COKE BOTTLER NARROWLY BEAT EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In results that narrowly beat analysts' expectations, Coca-Cola
Enterprises said Tuesday that its second-quarter profit rose 26
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Profit from operations at the company, Coca-Cola's largest
bottler, increased to $131 million, or 31 cents a share, compared
with $104 million, or 24 cents a share, in the quarter a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent period, a one-time charge of $12 million for
layoffs in Britain, where Coca-Cola Enterprises is struggling with
lower-priced Coke products in what has been one of its more
lucrative businesses, made net income $123 million, or 29 cents a
share. Results in the period a year earlier included a $103 million
charge for recalling products from France and Belgium, making net
income $34 million, or 8 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected the company to earn 28 cents a share,
according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue rose 8 percent, to $4.03 billion from $3.8 billion,
though sales volume declined in North America, its largest market,
and in Britain, another major market.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were slightly ahead because of higher pricing in North
America and higher sales costs, but it was nothing to write home
about,'' said Bill Pecoriello, a beverage analyst for Sanford C.
Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   Volume in North America, which accounts for most of the
bottler's sales, continues to be uncertain. While revenue per case
increased 5 percent, consumers seemed to be balking at higher
prices charged in supermarkets, where until recently Coke and Pepsi
were locked in a price war that kept the cost of six-packs and
two-liter bottles low.
</P>
<P>
   Coke and its archrival are betting that higher prices will
eventually be accepted by consumers, but so far consumers seem
reluctant. Sales of store-brand soda, which is cheaper, have
increased at double-digit rates this year, according to data
compiled by Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. The soft-drink category
is up 2.5 percent for the year, while store-brand soda has grown
9.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Volume growth is essential to Coca-Cola's earnings growth. The
company's chairman has said he expects volume to increase 5 percent
to 6 percent worldwide this year, and rise 7 percent to 8 percent
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to expect full-year volume in North America to be
flat to up 1 percent versus the prior year,'' said John R. Alm,
Coca-Cola Enterprises' president and chief operating officer.
Coca-Cola Enterprises, which is 40 percent owned by Coca-Cola,
accounts for 74 percent of Coke's North American sales in bottles
and cans.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts in May, Alm warned that
domestic volume would increase just 1 percent to 2 percent this
year, while estimates had been 2 percent to 3 percent. After he
made that announcement, his company's share price plummeted
$6.9375, to $15.625, a 52-week low. Shares of Coca-Cola were
dragged lower as well, losing $3, to $48.9375.
</P>
<P>
   The newly lowered volume estimates did not take a toll on the
stock Tuesday. Shares of Coca-Cola Enterprises rose Tuesday by just
less than $1, to close at $18.4375. Coca-Cola is holding a
conference call today to discuss its own second-quarter results,
which are being announced this morning.
</P>
<P>
   The bottler's sales were up 5 percent in the more lucrative
vending area, the company said. In Europe, sales rose 15.5 percent
in the quarter, although the second quarter of last year was a
particularly bleak one, in which Coke products were pulled from
store shelves and production halted in Belgium and France because
of contamination fears. &QL;

HIGH NOON FOR JOHNSON AND GREENE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Two months ago, Michael Johnson told a
small group of reporters that he would never borrow again from
professional wrestling to hype a race. He had learned his lesson
three years ago, he said, when he traded verbal half-nelsons with
Donovan Bailey of Canada to promote a manufactured 150-meter race.
Johnson ended up grabbing his leg in injury while Bailey grabbed
the title of world's fastest man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did the WWF thing,'' Johnson said, referring to the match
race in Toronto between the Olympic 100- and 200-meter champions.
``I'm not doing it anymore. I did it for the sake of the sport, and
it all worked well until the gun went off and I got injured. That's
not me. That's not what I'm about.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, facing an expected showdown at 200 meters on Sunday with
Maurice Greene, the current world record-holder at 100 meters, the
normally taciturn Johnson has again decided to hurl a few verbal
body slams. His words, both spoken and written, have provided a
riveting if uncharacteristic subtext to the most eagerly awaited
event of the Olympic track and field trials. And they reflect the
fact that, despite his gold medals and world records at 200 meters
(19.32 seconds) and 400 meters (43.18 seconds), Johnson has found
it necessary to repeatedly defend his stunning accomplishments
against what he considers disrespectful remarks about his speed,
character and integrity. ``I feel I need to defend myself,''
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I do dislike a lot of things Maurice Greene has said
about me and his attempt to elevate himself using my name.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, the 1996 Olympic champion at 100 meters, charged that
Johnson faked the injury to his left thigh once he realized he was
going to lose their 1997 match race. Greene's camp has accused
Johnson of ducking him on the international circuit. Greene has
also suggested that Johnson's world record at 200 meters was set in
Atlanta mainly because the track was built at the limit of
allowable hardness. Johnson bristles at these slights, which nag at
him like a pulled hamstring muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donovan was a young guy who came into the sport and did not
show any consistency,'' Johnson said in a recent interview. ``He
won a gold medal that they were going to give to someone anyway. I
did something in Atlanta that no one had ever done. I put more
pressure on myself than anyone. Now all of a sudden I'm supposed to
be faking it? And I'm supposed to be afraid of Maurice, a guy who
has never run faster than 19.8? That's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, Johnson has called Greene immature. Last Friday, in
a column written for USA Today, Johnson said that Greene was not
smart for scheduling a flurry of races in Europe during late June
and early July. He also criticized Greene's Los Angeles-based
training group, known as Hudson Smith International, saying the
members were unfocused and resting on past accomplishments. His
assessment of HSI was inaccurate _ the group's athletes have swept
all three Olympic spots in the men's 100 meters, taken a silver
medal in the women's 100 meters and won first place in the men's
pole vault and long jump _ but Johnson has hardly retracted his
words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people aren't used to being criticized,'' Johnson said.
``You either handle it or you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene has said he viewed the trials 200 as a semifinal match,
with the Olympics being the final, but he has also said, ``I'm
going to get Michael.'' Johnson said he would not settle for second
place at the trials because ``I'm better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think winning the race is going to silence any
critics,'' Johnson said. ``Once I beat him, Maurice will say, `My
goal is to win the Olympic Games.' Which is what he's supposed to
say. I'm not going to win to silence him, but because I can win and
I'm supposed to.''
</P>
<P>
   Trash-talking is an age-old custom in the sprints, where
athletes look for the slightest edge in races decided by hundredths
of a second. Johnson said he believed that Greene's bravado came
from insecurity not confidence. Greene said he laughed at Johnson's
public comments and just wants to put on a show. ``I like the
WWF,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But why the criticism of Johnson, who possesses a combination of
speed and endurance unmatched in the history of sprinting? ``I
think that's just the nature of the sport,'' said Ato Boldon of
Trinidad, who finished third to Johnson in the 200 at the Atlanta
Olympics and who trains daily with Greene in Los Angeles. ``Michael
Johnson could have 15 gold medals. He'd still be attacked by guys
like me and Maurice who want what he has. There is no respect in
this sport. You are only as good as your last race, and even then
you are going to be disrespected.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprinters are reluctant to speak respectfully of each other,
Johnson said, for fear of showing vulnerability. The quarter-milers
who have faced him, however, have been forced into deferential
submission by his dominance. Johnson has lost only 3 of 78 races
over 400 meters in the past 11 years. He won the Olympic trials on
Sunday by nearly a second.
</P>
<P>
   At the 200, injury has made Johnson more vulnerable in recent
years. He has run 16 200-meter races since breaking the world
record in Atlanta, but only four times has he dipped under 20
seconds. He owns the fastest time in the world this year, 19.71
seconds, but that was a race at altitude in South Africa. His
fastest time at sea level since Atlanta is 19.91 seconds, slower
than Greene's personal best of 19.86. The two sprinters have met
twice at 200 meters, and each has won once. Greene won the 200
meters at the 1999 world championships in Seville, Spain, while
Johnson did not enter the event, concentrating on the 400 meters.
</P>
<P>
   In Boldon's estimation, the first person off the curve on Sunday
will be the winner at the Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael knows he's not going to come off the turn behind
Maurice and run him down,'' Boldon said. ``Not now. Not unless he's
in 19.32 shape, which I don't think he is. If he is in 19.32 shape,
it doesn't matter what Maurice does. If Maurice comes off the turn
with a significant lead, that's it. Michael will not only not
challenge, Michael will appreciate the fact that every time he's
run a really fast 200, he's been hurt. He will settle for second
and bear the brunt of criticism to come and prepare for the
Olympics. On the other hand, if Maurice comes off even or behind,
he's going to floor it. He's going to try to get Michael. I don't
know if Michael can be run down.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In running his startling world record at Atlanta, Johnson
injured his left hamstring muscle. Against Bailey in 1997, he
injured the thigh muscle in his left leg. It was later determined
that the sacroiliac joint in his pelvis was slightly rotated, which
threw out of alignment the muscles in his left leg, making them
less efficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a cup of coffee in a saucer that's not quite sitting
in the groove, or a car with a front end that's out of alignment,''
said Dale Smith, who is Johnson's physical therapist. ``A tire that
gets 60,000 miles now will only get 15 or 20,000.''
</P>
<P>
   The greatest race of Johnson's career may not have been his
world records, but the 400-meter final at the 1997 world
championship in Athens, when he came from fifth in the final curve
to first at the finish on guts and experience. Tests later revealed
that his left leg had become slightly shorter, was still carrying
significant amounts of fluid from the injury against Bailey and was
30 percent weaker than his right leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the circumstances, that might have been his finest
race,'' said Clyde Hart, who coaches Johnson in Waco, Tex.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Smith travels to each race with Johnson, often
immersing him in ice baths and massaging him or helping him stretch
late into the evening after running rounds. Greene asserted that
Johnson would shut down if he was behind out of the curve Sunday,
saying Johnson ``doesn't want to put his body through that kind of
stress because every time something happens to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Johnson camp fumes at this, pointing out that he chased down
the 400 field in Athens on pure determination. There is nothing to
show that a sprinter is more susceptible to injury running from
behind than in front, Hart said. ``Besides that,'' he added, ``we
don't tend to be behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said: ``That's the difference between Maurice and me.
Maurice depends on me being afraid and shutting down or breaking
down to win races. I depend on Michael running great to win races.
It's obvious now that he feels the only way he can win this race is
to make me break down.''
</P>
<P>
   The brash but patient Greene, who holds the world record of 9.79
seconds at 100 meters, believes the two runners will come off the
curve together, or within one and a half steps of each other, and
that he will pull victory out at the end. ``My foot speed is
greater than his,'' Greene said. ``I believe I am a lot stronger
sprinter than he is.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I can't afford to let him come off the curve three
or four steps ahead. If he's that far ahead, I'll press too hard to
catch him and run out of gas.''
</P>
<P>
   Boldon, the 1997 world champion at 200 meters, said he would
give the nod to Johnson because of experience. ``It doesn't mean I
don't think Maurice can win,'' he said of his training partner.
``But I don't think Maurice understands that this is a race where
there are 10 ways to win it and 20 to lose it. Michael has probably
eliminated 19 ways to lose.''

MRS. CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN EXPANDS ON A CURRENT LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillary Rodham Clinton presented her plan Tuesday to
extend health insurance to millions of Americans, including 1.1
million New Yorkers. Her plan, which hews closely to the one
proposed by Vice President Al Gore, could not be further in details
and scope from the ill-fated program she helped to mastermind in
the early 1990's.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton outlined her initiative in a news conference at
Columbia-Presbyterian Center in Manhattan. Among other things, it
would, expand an existing government program to insure children.
``We will never be the kind of New York or America we should and
can be if we do not figure out a way to provide quality affordable
health care to every one of us,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, more than 19 percent of people under 65, or 3.1
million people, lack health insurance. A large number of them are
the working poor who make too much money to qualify for Medicaid
but do not receive benefits from their employer or cannot afford to
buy them. And despite a federal program that covers children, about
700,000 children in New York still lack insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of insurance and health care to all Americans was
Clinton's goal in the early 90's. Her plan for universal coverage
was flattened by Congress in 1994 after determined lobbying by
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   That plan put much of the burden of covering the uninsured on
employers. But the plan presented Tuesday by Clinton, who is
running for the Senate, returns much of the burden to the
government and steers clear from visions of insuring the entire
nation in one blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may remember that seven years ago, I had a few ideas about
this topic,'' said Clinton, who has taken to joking about her
earlier failed effort and stressing that she has learned to take
small steps toward change in one of the most complex policy issues
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Her opponent in the Senate race, Representative Rick A. Lazio,
immediately criticized the plan, asserting that she did not reveal
where the money to pay for such expansions would come from. His
camp added that the federal government has shortchanged New York by
not providing a fair share of federal funds for existing programs,
and asserted that Clinton should have influenced her husband in
this area.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton suggested that federal budget surpluses could be used to
pay for her plan.
</P>
<P>
   The core of her proposal relied heavily on the Children's Health
Insurance Program, a 1997 federal-state effort. In this program,
the federal government gives states 65 percent of their costs to
insure children from families whose income is no more than about
$31,000 a year, for a family of four, or about 200 percent of the
federal poverty line.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposes expanding that program to children in families
living at an income level from 250 to 300 percent of the poverty
line, or about $51,000 for a family of four. That would cost an
additional $10 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   She would also like to see the program extended to parents of
children living within this income bracket. The New York State
Legislature recently passed a similar plan, known as Family Health
Plus.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said she also would make sure that all states use their
money under the federal program, or face losing the federal
matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she proposes giving a 25 percent refundable tax
credit to people who are not insured through their jobs and need to
buy insurance as individuals, and giving families whose incomes are
above 300 percent of the poverty line a chance to buy Children's
Health Insurance Program insurance at a rate cheaper than the
market rates for individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has made similar proposals. His and Clinton's plans differ
mostly in their generosity. Her proposals for establishing
eligibility are a bit more lenient.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan is far removed from her notions of universal
coverage in the early 1990's, which included a requirement that
employers pick up 80 percent of the cost of any health care plan
their workers chose.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has not yet released any specific proposal to deal with
those who do not have health insurance. Clinton's proposal came
after Lazio's wife, Patricia, a nurse, began appearing in a
television advertisement last week defending his record on health
care issues in Congress. ``He has not exactly been silent on these
issues,'' said a campaign spokesman, Michael Marr.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's advisers insisted that President Clinton has yet to make
sure that New York gets its fair share of federal money. New York
is indeed in danger of spending large amounts of state money on the
Children's Health Insurance Program next year. Under the law, New
York is to have 65 percent of the costs for its health insurance
program reimbursed by the federal government, up to $256 million.
The law sets a timetable, in the fall, for states either to use
their allocations or to relinquish what they haven't used to other
states.
</P>
<P>
   Because New York has by far the largest such program in the
country _ 522,000 New York children are enrolled _ it is well on
its way to surpassing its cap. That means that New York might have
to pick up the costs of additional enrollments.
</P>
<P>
   But many members of Congress would like to see states that have
failed to spend their money get another two years to work out their
programs before losing any funds. Health care experts say it is
unlikely that the Clinton administration could find a way to
release more money to New York for this program until these issues
are resolved.

THEA DISPEKER, 97, MUSIC AGENT WHO NURTURED OPERATIC TALENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By RALPH BLUMENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thea Dispeker, a molder of operatic talent from
Lauritz Melchior to Richard Leech and boss of her own classical
music artists agency for more than 50 years, died July 17 at her
home in Manhattan. She was 97.
</P>
<P>
   Laurence Wasserman, her successor at the New York-based
management agency that still bears her name, said that she had
relinquished control (she called retirement a dirty word) only
reluctantly in late 1998, shortly after her 96th birthday. Until
then, Dispeker, erudite, opinionated, acerbic, often presided at
auditions in her penthouse apartment on East 79th Street after full
days at the offices of Thea Dispeker Inc., (pronounced TAY-uh
DIS-peck-uh) at 59 E. 54th St.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was much more interested in developing talent than taking
over the great names,'' said Wasserman, who had contracted with
Dispeker in 1977, when she was almost 75, to succeed her as the
company's president.
</P>
<P>
   Yet her career was bound up with some of the 20th century's
greatest musical names: Richard Tucker, Martina Arroyo, Judith
Blegen, Roberta Peters, Jan Peerce, Hermann Prey, Pablo Casals and
Wieland Wagner among many others. Indeed, as some associates saw
it, Dispeker was the century.
</P>
<P>
   Born Dorothea Schlesinger in Munich in 1902, she studied piano
and was tutored by her father, a lawyer, author and violinist who
had married the daughter of a wealthy banker. At 12, she briefly
ran off with a passing circus before going on to study musicology
at the University of Munich. After a visit to Tutankhamen's tomb in
Egypt in 1924 she contracted polio. But she recovered and worked in
Munich with the renowned musicologist Alfred Einstein, marrying and
soon divorcing a man named Dispeker and finally fleeing Nazi
Germany for the United States in 1938. Still she remained an ardent
Germanophile all her life.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, she gave piano lessons. She started a classical
music section of the W. Colston Leigh speakers bureau, where she
represented Melchior and other opera stars. When she went into
business for herself in 1947, she won Tucker as a client, and later
James King, Arlene Saunders, Maria Stader, Benita Valente, and
other singers and instrumentalists.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947 she helped found the Little Orchestra Society for
children's concerts. In 1950, she organized the first Pablo Casals
festival in the tiny village of Prades, France, where Casals was
living in exile from Spain.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, she married a fellow refugee from Germany, Lawrence
Grieg, known as Lolo. He died in 1986. They had no children.
</P>
<P>
   Oblivious to advancing age, Dispeker sought out young singers
and musicians to promote; she emerged with a portfolio of rising
stars, including Leech, the tenor, and the Swedish baritone, Hakan
Hagegard. ``She had a nose for talent,'' said Wasserman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thea has always been open to hearing anybody who calls the
office for an audition,'' said Leech, who signed with the agency
during his first season with the New York City Opera in 1984.
``She's been a beacon for opportunity for young singers.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 the International Society for the Performing Arts
Foundation gave her an award of merit timed to the 50th anniversary
of her agency.
</P>
<P>
   But she was almost as famous for her prickly interpersonal
relations with staff and other associates, and her sparring with
Wasserman was an open secret in the music management business.
Although she continued until several years ago to drive, employees
came to dread her friendly invitations for a lift home, finding the
rides often terrifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always a very secure person,'' Dispeker told an
interviewer three years ago, when she was 94. ``I always
instinctively knew what was right and wrong and what was good and
what was bad. That's mainly what people miss today.''

 Gore launches spirited Missouri campaign in KC  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY _ On a steam-bath of an afternoon in Kansas City, Al
Gore launched his Missouri comeback bid with a rousing call to arms
for the Democratic cause and a scathing attack on his rival
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing presumptive GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush by
11 points in a recent statewide poll, an energetic Gore tore into
the Texas governor, saying his tax-cut plan caters to special
interests and would send the national debt soaring again.
</P>
<P>
   ``You add up what they promise, and it's way bigger than the
surplus,'' Gore said at a rally at the Barney Allis Plaza, 12th and
Central streets downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Showing no ill effects from the sauna-like conditions, Gore
seemed in his element with a high-energy stump speech that at times
resembled a rapid-fire rebel yell.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I'm running for president _ to fight for you,''
Gore shouted at one point in his 25-minute address. ``To fight for
Kansas City. To fight for Missouri. To fight for working families.
To fight for those who don't have another champion. I want to fight
for your family and your future.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats estimated the crowd at 3,000 to 4,000, but Kansas City
Police later released a far more modest total. ``One thousand
tops,'' said Sgt. Randy Sims.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's downtown stump speech was the first of several events
during a rare, overnight visit by a presidential candidate to
Kansas City. Later Tuesday, he raised about $100,000 from 28
partisans at a sedate Democratic National Committee fund-raiser at
the Kansas City Club, 1228 Baltimore Ave.
</P>
<P>
   At a lobster dinner, Gore mocked the policies of the Republicans
as ``stale.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Their whole agenda is 20 years old,'' Gore said. ``We've been
there, done that, still paying the bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he left for the Park Place Hotel at Interstate 435
and Front Street in the East Bottoms. Visiting dignitaries usually
stay downtown or on the Country Club Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really random,'' Gore aide Alex Zaroulis said about the
hotel choice. ``They had enough rooms for the staff and the folks
traveling with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Gore is to begin his day with stops at one or two
locations around Kansas City. On Tuesday the campaign would not
disclose the locations.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a visit to Raytown, he is expected to unveil new
elements of his crime-fighting agenda. At a meeting with law
enforcement officials at Raytown City Hall, he is set to release a
plan calling for 10,000 more local prosecutors across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also is expected to renew his call for 50,000 new police
officers _ a plan styled after President Clinton's former call for
100,000 new officers.
</P>
<P>
   Crime also was the focus of the first part of Gore's day
Tuesday. In Memphis, Tenn., Gore proposed his own crime victims'
constitutional amendment. Under his plan, which is the focus of
television ads now airing in Kansas City, victims would be notified
when their attackers were released. And victims would have the
right to be heard at sentencing and be eligible for restitution
from a convict.
</P>
<P>
   ``The accused criminals have all kinds of rights, and we all
understand why it's part of our system,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But here's the point: When those rights are enshrined in the
Constitution and the rights of victims are not, whenever the two
are in conflict, it's not even a close contest. The victims are put
in the back seat and sometimes completely ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, though, Republicans charged that the
Clinton-Gore administration had a chance to pass a bipartisan
amendment this year, but opted to kill the measure for political
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton-Gore withdrew their support for the victims-rights
bill in April of this year in order to preserve it as a campaign
issue this November,'' said Cass County Prosecutor Chris Koster. He
and other law enforcement officials and police held a press
conference in Kansas City before Gore arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's visit comes at a time of mixed signals about his standing
in the national race. Although a poll last week in /{The Kansas
City Star/} showed Gore trailing in Missouri, a national bellwether
state, by 48-37 percent, two new national polls out Tuesday showed
the race nearly dead even.
</P>
<P>
   Those standing in the crowd Tuesday night had more good news for
the vice president. Many were impressed with his vitality and a
sense that Gore was anything but the stiff, wooden caricature so
often joked about on late-night TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's gotten this image that's not correct,'' said
Angie Reuter of Kansas City. ``He was more dynamic than Clinton
was.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen him this fired up,'' said Ed Drake, a retired
local labor leader. ``He's getting into the swing of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanging from beams in the Barney Allis Plaza were a series of
posters proclaiming support from Kansas and Missouri labor
organizations: Pipefitters Local 533, Teamsters Local 541 and
Plumbers Local 8, among others. Gore's standing with labor has
suffered in recent months because of his support for free-trade
policies that many national labor groups oppose.
</P>
<P>
   Gore began his Kansas City appearance on a somber note by
calling for a moment of silence to honor the life of Republican
Sen. Paul Coverdell of Georgia, who death was announced shortly
before Gore took the stage. Coverdell had surgery Monday to relieve
pressure from a cerebral hemorrhage, but died from swelling in the
brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a partisan gathering, but we are all Americans,'' Gore
said. ``And when something like this happens, we join together in
thinking of the family...and honoring the service of an individual
who helped make our Constitution work.''
</P>
<P>
   Dressed casually in a polo and khakis, Gore covered a litany of
issues, from a patients' bill of rights to the need to raise the
minimum wage and teacher pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to treat teachers like the professionals they are,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he would balance the budget every year and work toward
paying off the national debt by 2012.
</P>
<P>
   On Social Security, Gore charged that Bush's plan to allow
individuals to invest a part of their retirement savings in the
stock market would be disastrous. Under the plan, money would have
to be borrowed to keep the system solvent, Gore said, because there
would not be enough money flowing into the program to meet ongoing
obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans ``are proposing a plan that will cause it to run
dry,'' Gore said of Bush's plan. The system, he added, ``should not
be tampered with.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said individuals who lost money through the stock-market
option would be expected to be bailed out in the same way the
federal government aided savings and loan institutions that failed
in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, though, has said that allowing individuals to invest in
the stock market will increase their Social Security checks and
extend the program's life.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore said his plan would offer the best future for the
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will keep Social Security and Medicare in an iron-clad lock
box with a sign _ Politicians: Hands Off!'' Gore said.

POISED TO RUN FOR GOVERNOR, TORRICELLI SPLITS THE DEMOCRATS
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Sen. Robert Torricelli has all but officially
declared his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for governor,
setting off a pitched battle with Mayor James E. McGreevey of
Woodbridge, the party's nominee in 1997, for the support of
officials across New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The showdown between two longtime allies has thrown the state's
Democratic Party into turmoil, just when it seemed to have been
recovering from a divisive Senate primary, and is raising concerns
that the distraction could hobble the party's performance in the
November elections.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday Jon Corzine, the Democratic nominee for Senate,
rescinded his endorsement of McGreevey, saying in an internal
campaign memo that he would remain neutral and acknowledging that
his campaign aides and advisers were caught in the middle of the
gubernatorial fight.
</P>
<P>
   In a replay of the jockeying for support that went on during the
Senate race between Corzine and Jim Florio, Torricelli and
McGreevey are carving up New Jersey county by county, racing to
lock up commitments from countless Democratic chairmen and
financiers, freeholders and mayors, union leaders and influential
ministers.
</P>
<P>
   It is still unclear who has the upper hand. Advisers to
Torricelli and McGreevey are both claiming broad-based support.
</P>
<P>
   But one side must be grossly exaggerating its support, or party
officials are telling each man what he wants to hear. For example,
in Essex County, a key battleground that has the state's most
enrolled Democrats, Torricelli and McGreevey are both claiming the
support of Mayor Sharpe James of Newark, State Sen. Richard Codey
and Thomas Giblin, the county and state Democratic chairman.
</P>
<P>
   James, who met with Torricelli on Monday, did not respond to
phone messages. Neither Codey nor Giblin would reveal whom he was
supporting. But two McGreevey supporters said Codey had told them
on Tuesday that he had reiterated his support for McGreevey in a
conversation with Torricelli that afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, Torricelli's camp is telling wavering Democrats that
he has the support of roughly two-thirds of the counties in the
state, including five of the seven counties in South Jersey. But
supporters of McGreevey say that in the south, only Camden and
Burlington Counties are backing Torricelli.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the state's Democratic leaders would clearly take sides
on Tuesday, or even speak for the record. But many were talking
plenty all the same.
</P>
<P>
   Those who favor Torricelli say he is simply the best-known, most
powerful and most electable Democrat in New Jersey. Next to
McGreevey, one senior party official said, ``it's like Mark McGwire
versus the home run king of the Pee Wee League.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brad Lawrence, a consultant to McGreevey whose firm is also
working for Corzine, said Torricelli, whose 1996 campaign
fund-raising operation has drawn the scrutiny of federal
prosecutors, would be more vulnerable to attack. ``We know the
microscopic scrutiny that Jim went under in 1997, and we know he
survived it rather well,'' Lawrence said. ``There are no dark
secrets out there. I think we can withstand the scrutiny of this
process better than the senator can.''

SALLY KOVALCHICK, 61, EDITOR IN CHIEF OF WORKMAN PUBLISHING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sally Kovalchick, editor in chief of Workman Publishing Co., who
supervised the publication of some notable best-selling books, died
July 15 at her home in Southampton, N.Y. She was 61.
</P>
<P>
   The cause apparently was a heart attack, a company statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kovalchick spent 26 years at Workman, was a senior editor and
then became editor in chief several years ago. She oversaw the
publication of about 15 books that became best sellers by the
company's count, including ``The Official Preppy Handbook.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She quietly gave birth to enormous best sellers that achieved
cult status,'' said Peter Workman, the company's chief executive.
``She had a great publishing gut'' _ an instinct for what books
would be successful, he said. ``Her particular talent was to make
books better, to get the most out of authors and their subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   Kovalchick specialized in humorous books. In a 1990 interview
she said: ``Parodies are always good. We look for a subject, and
for the joke. Our authors usually submit complete manuscripts. Once
in a while we have a funny idea but can't figure out what to do
with it. The hard part is that everyone copies us.''
</P>
<P>
   Workman said it was Kovalchick who nurtured ``The Official
Preppy Handbook,'' a 224-page work of humor, into being. Published
in 1980, the book was the joint handiwork of four preppies in their
mid-20s who were all Ivy League college graduates: Jonathan
Roberts, Lisa Birnbach, Carol McD. Wallace and Mason Wiley. A
tongue-in-cheek guidebook to ``living the elite and proper life of
Prep,'' the book was true enough and funny enough to reach the top
of what was then called The New York Times' trade paperback
best-seller list of Jan. 4, 1981, for the second successive week
and remain on the list for 65 weeks all told.
</P>
<P>
   Kovalchick also oversaw the publication of ``Cat'' (1975), a
best-selling collection of cartoons of cats by B. Kliban. One
``Cat'' cartoon pictured a guitar-playing feline singing: ``Love to
eat them mousies. Mousies what I love to eat. Bite they little
heads off . . . nibble on they tiny feet.'' Within a few years, the
Kliban cats began appearing on calendars, greeting cards and other
products, becoming a $50 million industry in the mid-1980s. Workman
published most of the 10 Kliban books.
</P>
<P>
   Another best-selling book ushered into print by Kovalchick was
``The Dieter's Guide to Weight Loss During Sex'' (1978), by Richard
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The publishing projects she supervised in her later years
included ``1001 Ways to Reward Employees'' (1994) by Bob Nelson.
Workman says more than a million copies of it have been sold.
</P>
<P>
   Another later project of hers was the Brain Quest series of
question-and-answer games in card deck form for children through
seventh grade.
</P>
<P>
   Kovalchick was born in Indiana, Pa., and graduated from Wheaton
College in Norton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by two sisters, Becky Rankin of Monroeville, Pa.
and Millie Glinsky of Indiana, Pa.; and a brother, Joseph, also of
Indiana.

 &HT;    Media outlets retract early reports of Coverdell's death
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    and John Druckenmiller
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Several local TV and radio newsrooms were caught in
the embarrassing position of retracting initial stories of Sen.
Paul Coverdell's death Tuesday night, minutes after a hospital
spokeswoman denied those reports.
</P>
<P>
   TV stations WXIA and WSB, along with WSB and WGST radio,
reported shortly before 6:20 p.m. that sources confirmed the
senator had died. Within minutes, Nina Montanaro, Piedmont Hospital
public affairs director, called the reports ``false'' and added,
``He is in serious condition and he remains in ICU. I'm refuting
that report.''
</P>
<P>
   At 6:55 p.m., the hospital issued a statement acknowledging his
death. The time of death was put at 6:10 p.m. _ apparently
confirming the accuracy of the initial reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact we were accurate in our report means nothing when you
look at the magnitude of the loss,'' said Dave Roberts, news
director at WXIA, which was first with the report of the senator's
death. ``From a journalistic standpoint, the bottom line is who
cares if you're first? You had better be correct. When someone has
a loved one on life support, who cares if the media gets its story?
We need to be more sensitive to that.''
</P>
<P>
   WSB-TV Managing Editor Mike Dreaden says he was confident of his
station's sources, but felt an apology was required when the
hospital officially denied the senator's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``As sure as you may be, when someone calls your story into
question, the reaction is 'Let's go double, triple and quadruple
confirm that,''' Dreaden says. ``It was not the kind of thing you
want to get in a battle over on the air. It seemed inappropriate to
get into a debate with the hospital, so we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither WAGA nor WGCL reported Coverdell's death until the
hospital's official announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Budd McEntee, WAGA news director, said it was difficult watching
two competing stations report the senator's death but that he felt
a greater responsibility to wait until an official announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``My greatest fear was that the family had not signed off or all
been notified, and that we would be jumping the gun with
information prior to their acceptance of his official death,''
McEntee said. ``I wanted to make sure everyone in the senator's
family had been walked through that process. There was no clear
advantage to reporting him deceased before he officially was.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds WGCL News Director Mike Cavender, ``What this points to is
that when news organizations are trying desperately to confirm a
big story, sometimes circumstances are such that information gets
confused second by second. I applaud (WSB) for retracting (their
story) when they thought they'd reported it erroneously. It shows
how complex this kind of story can become when you try to run down
information in a matter of minutes or seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Charles, WGST's director of programming and news, says his
news team ``absolutely had to report the story'' as it broke from
the floor of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``(South Dakota Sen. Tom) Daschle did it on the floor of the
Senate at 6:15 p.m.,'' Charles says, and ``we had it on the air at
6:17 p.m.'' The station took caution, he said, to ensure it was
sourced to Daschle.
</P>
<P>
   Evening anchor Lisa Nichoals immediately went back on the air to
relay the Piedmont announcement, he says, and broke in again just
before 7 with confirmation of Coverdell's death.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Camp, news director of WSB radio, says ``sources in
Washington told us Senator Coverdell had died.'' Those sources were
credible, he says. ``We had no reason not to think they weren't on
the up and up.
</P>
<P>
   So when WSB first announced Coverdell's death, ``We didn't name
anybody... We were just quoting sources,'' Camp says.
</P>
<P>
   The Piedmont announcement denying the reports came minutes
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, you're sort of weighing both sides,'' Camp
says. ``We felt we had an obligation to go on and retract the
original statement. We went with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Would WSB handle it differently?
</P>
<P>
   ``l'll be talking about this tomorrow morning. We have to let
the dust settle on this'' Camp said.
</P>
<P>
   Piedmont officials weren't available for comment. The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution's website - www.ajc.com - didn't post news of
Coverdell's death until it was confirmed by the hospital just
before 7 p.m., said Susan Hardin, ajc.com managing editor.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcasters' websites offered mixed updates on Coverdell as
of Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Both WSB radio and TV, as of 9:20 p.m., featured local stories
telling only of Coverdell's earlier surgery and, under national
headlines, a link to a story about his death. Neither WAGA's
www.fox5atlanta.com nor www. wgst.com had news of his passing.
</P>
<P>
   WXIA's www.11alive.com had a story on his death as did
www.cbsatlanta.com, WGCL's website.
</P>
<P>
   Political reporter Bill Shipp's website, www.billshipp.com,
contained a solemn update box with this message: GEORGIA SENIOR
SENATOR PAUL COVERDELL IS DEAD AT 61.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's own website, www.senate.gov/(tilde)coverdell/, had
not been changed to reflect his passing.
</P>
<P>
   The initial flip-flop on Coverdell's death might have sounded
familiar to some.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1988, U.S. Rep. Bob Stump (R-Ariz.) told colleagues:
``Mr. Speaker, I have the sad responsibility to tell you this
afternoon that Bob Hope passed away. We will all miss him very
much.'' The story was picked up briefly before being retracted.
Hope, 97, recently returned home after an extended hospital stay.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball great Joe DiMaggio also was proclaimed dead in January
1999, three months before he passed away. NBC ran a ``crawl''
across the bottom of a program announcing DiMaggio was dead. In
fact, he was watching the program with his friend and lawyer,
Morris Engelberg, who later said he told the baseball legend,
``'Joe, we must be in heaven together.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC ran another crawl about 20 minutes later, saying its
previous report was inaccurate. The network later said a technician
in the New York control room inadvertently sent the item and
subsequently apologized to DiMaggio.

NEAGLE MAKES A WINNING FIRST IMPRESSION AS YANKS TOP PHILS, 3-1 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Denny Neagle warmed up in the bullpen in left-center
field at Yankee Stadium on Tuesday night, several paces from
Monument Park. A day earlier, he had become excited when he talked
about his debut with the Yankees and said that he merely had to
peer at the monuments to understand how special his first start
would be. Tuesday night, Neagle made sure it was special for more
than just the historic baseball setting.
</P>
<P>
   Tugging at his uniform pants or jersey, oddly blowing into his
left hand on a muggy night and working quickly, Neagle tamed the
Philadelphia Phillies and helped the Yankees roll to a 3-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The newest Yankee earned standing ovations after closing the
seventh and eighth innings with strikeouts, and he heard chants of
``Den-ny! Den-ny!'' His sturdy eight-inning performance allowed Joe
Torre to exhale and even smile on his 60th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   With Orlando Hernandez going on the 15-day disabled list Tuesday
because of a sprained right elbow and with David Cone going 12
starts without a victory, the Yankees were relieved to see Neagle
dominate Philadelphia. Torre repeatedly discusses how the Yankees
win because of solid starting pitching, and the acquisition of the
left-hander from the Cincinnati Reds last Wednesday should continue
to boost a sagging and inconsistent rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle allowed one run and five hits while striking out three
and walking two before turning the mound over to Mariano Rivera,
who retired the Phillies in order in the ninth for his 22nd save.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's Curt Schilling, an ace whose name pops up in
trade rumors several times a month, was superior to Neagle for a
good portion of the night. The Yankees did not collect a hit off
Schilling until there were two out in the fourth inning, but they
supplied the most important hits of the game in the fifth and
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   David Justice led off the fifth by lining a homer into the front
row of seats in right field. It was Justice's 24th home run of the
season, his third as a Yankee and his fourth homer in 27 career
at-bats against Schilling.
</P>
<P>
   After Chuck Knoblauch walked and Derek Jeter singled with one
out in the sixth, Bernie Williams rapped a triple to left-center to
drive in both and put the Yankees ahead, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   That gave Williams 87 runs batted in and helped the Yankees
finish interleague play with an 11-6 record this season.
</P>
<P>
   But this game was about pitching, not offense, and this game was
about the witty and talented Neagle. He has already endeared
himself to his teammates with his unusual imitations and his
eccentric personality, but his behavior would not be so funny if he
were a so-so pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees traded four prospects to get Neagle, and general
manager Brian Cashman is eager to begin negotiations with Neagle's
agent on a multiyear contract extension. Maybe he is a little more
eager after Tuesday night's stupendous effort.
</P>
<P>
   When Torre was asked what he liked about Neagle, he said: ``The
successes he has had in places and pitching in the postseason.
Obviously, he knows what he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, the Yankees were obviously happy that they had
snared Neagle. The left-hander was tested early when Doug Glanville
smacked a single under his glove to open the game. Glanville moved
to second on a wild pitch and took third on a groundout. But Neagle
retired Scott Rolen on a popout to strand Glanville.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle walked Pat Burrell to begin the second and allowed Alex
Arias' one-out single, but he came back to strike out Mickey
Morandini and retire Tom Prince on a fly ball.

Houston NFL team sets preseason foes
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
If everything goes according to plan and construction is completed
on time, Houston's NFL expansion team will play for the first time
in the new 69,000-seat, retractable-roof stadium against the Miami
Dolphins in the fourth preseason game of the 2002 season.
</P>
<P>
   Bob McNair's expansion team, which will begin play in a newly
realigned NFL in 2002, does not have an official nickname, a head
coach or a division to join, but it does have an inaugural
five-game preseason schedule.
</P>
<P>
   After making its debut in the nationally televised Pro Football
Hall of Fame Game at Canton, Ohio, against an opponent to be
determined _ Kansas City is McNair's first choice _ Houston visits
Denver and Dallas and hosts Miami and Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob and I sat down and came up with a plan for that first
preseason, and we think we've got a good schedule,'' general
manager Charley Casserly said. ``We wanted to schedule good
franchises that produce the kind of teams that'll be attractive to
our fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows for sure how good teams are going to be in 2002
because of the system (free agency and the salary cap), but we've
scheduled solid organizations that should continue to have good
teams and be top draws.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair and Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones plan to play an
annual preseason game on a home-and-home basis. Houston has
four-year preseason deals with Denver and Tampa Bay. Miami is
scheduled for the first two years and will be replaced by Kansas
City in 2004 and 2005.
</P>
<P>
   McNair also has a close relationship with Broncos owner Pat
Bowlen, who is chairman of the expansion committee. Houston and
Denver will play in new stadiums in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   As the 32nd franchise, Houston will be part of a realigned NFL
that will have eight divisions of four teams each.
</P>
<P>
   The owners are a long way from determining the new divisions,
but Casserly had to take the possibilities into consideration when
setting the preseason schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what division we're going to be in, but we've
been told we'll be in the AFC,'' Casserly said. ``One proposal has
us playing in the AFC Central with Pittsburgh, Cleveland and
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another has us in a new division with Jacksonville,
Indianapolis and Tennessee. The first thing was to take all of them
off the preseason list.''
</P>
<P>
   The dates and times haven't been determined for games in that
first preseason, but the order is set. Because the stadium is
supposed to be ready in August 2002, Denver and Dallas had to be
scheduled on the road.
</P>
<P>
   When McNair's team, which is expected to be named the Texans,
travels to Canton for its debut in late July, the Pro Football Hall
of Fame Game should be in its fourth year of being played on Monday
Night Football.
</P>
<P>
   In its second game, Houston visits the Broncos, who will be
playing their second season in the new 75,000-seat stadium that is
under construction next to Mile High Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   On the third weekend of preseason, Houston and Dallas will play
for the first time. McNair and Jones have forged the kind of
enterprising relationship that should be exciting for NFL fans in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams will have training camp in Texas. McNair and Jones
would like to see them practice against each other and perhaps
scrimmage early in camp before they play the game.
</P>
<P>
   After the Cowboys game, Houston's new stadium, which is being
built next to the Astrodome, should be ready for Miami.
</P>
<P>
   McNair has said he plans to have a special section underneath
his suite reserved for former Oilers players and coaches. Perhaps
Bum Phillips and Don Shula could be brought back as honorary
captains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Houston and Miami had a good rivalry for a long time,''
Casserly said. ``We thought bringing in the Dolphins for that first
game would be exciting for the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   The last preseason game is against Tampa Bay.

METS DOWN TORONTO BLUE JAYS, 11-7

<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Lenny Harris, the New York Mets' utility man, scored
two runs and added a run-scoring single on Tuesday night as the
Mets downed the Toronto Blue Jays, 11-7.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two games Harris has gotten a chance to play third
base and bat first, and he sparked the Mets again Tuesday night
with a leadoff home run. Harris, who is in his third stint as a
teammate of Mike Piazza's, said the trouble comes when the Mets
rely too heavily on their All-Star catcher. In the last two games,
Harris seems to have taken it upon himself to prove the point.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza had the game's most memorable hit, a grand slam in the
fifth inning that broke a 3-3 tie and made Bobby J. Jones the
winner despite an unsteady outing.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Harris who kept things lively Tuesday night, just as
he did on Monday, when his three hits and two stolen bases led to
an extra-inning victory. Derek Bell, who bats second, was Harris'
crony, going 3 for 4 with a homer and four runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   Harris drew a leadoff walk in the fifth, then stole second off
Chris Carpenter. Carpenter's pitches had movement, but they strayed
far from the strike zone, and he walked six Mets. He walked two in
the fourth inning, leading to a run, then walked two more after
Harris to load the bases in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   That would be fatal, because Piazza came up next. The Mets'
Robin Ventura gets considerable attention for his success with the
bases loaded (he has a .356 career average with 14 grand slams),
but Piazza may be even more dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   He went down in the strike zone and ripped a fastball into the
second deck in left center, 426 feet away. It gave the Mets a 7-3
lead and was Piazza's third grand slam of the season, tying a Mets
record. In his career, Piazza is batting .386 with the bases
loaded, and he has 12 slams.
</P>
<P>
   Harris has a chance to see significant playing time at third
base, with Ventura on the disabled list because of his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Franco was the first option at third base, but Harris
started there for the second game in a row Tuesday night, and
batted leadoff again. He had three hits and two stolen bases _
running on his own both times _ in a victory over the Jays on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he plays like that, you definitely want to see him
play,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Until Monday, Harris had only 2 hits in 21 at-bats since the
Mets acquired him from Arizona in early June. But Harris, who
batted .310 last year, was sure he would start producing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew sooner or later I'd get a chance to play a little
bit,'' Harris said. ``Stats are not important. People might look at
it and say he's struggling, his average is a buck-fifty or
something like that, but I'm a part-time player. It's not like I
can play everyday and come out of a slump. I'm a good hitter; I've
always been a good hitter. I wasn't worried about that.''

For '95 British Open champ, life remains a Daly struggle
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ The ugliest rumor of all _ and doesn't that
cover more real estate than even his biggest corkscrew drive? _ was
that John Daly didn't have enough scratch to make the trip back to
the scene of the greatest moment in his life.
</P>
<P>
   What with his owing $20,000 a month in alimony and his being
another $1 million or so in debt, nobody was assuming anything
about the burning fuse with blond hair. Until somebody actually saw
Daly on the grounds of St. Andrews' Old Course, it was fair to
guess he might not show at all.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the sad state of affairs has come to regarding the
last man to walk out of St. Andrews with the Claret Jug.
</P>
<P>
   The line between rumor and fact has been blurred by so many
years of self-torment. And it's gotten so bad that Daly has used up
the sympathetic shoulders that once were there for him to lean
upon.
</P>
<P>
   There no longer is a pat on the back from observers and peers.
While many considered him a cult hero of sorts when he won the
British Open in 1995, the burly, chain-smoking, hard-living man has
now dug such a deep abyss for himself that even a return to St.
Andrews probably won't be enough to rejuvenate him.
</P>
<P>
   His bottle no longer is half-full. It now is just a matter of
waiting to see if he wants to return to what his fellow golfers
know is a terrific way to live _ as a productive member of the PGA
Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``John is his own worst enemy,'' says Jack Nicklaus. ``He's not
going to get better until he gets rid of those demons in his
head.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows how many holes Daly has left on this golf course of
life. Whatever the number, the demons have him dormie.
</P>
<P>
   The only hope, perhaps, is that a return to St. Andrews _ his
own personal Last Chance Saloon _ will roust Daly into better form
and a better attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like coming home,'' Daly says. ``I'd have walked over
broken glass to be here. Nothing was going to stop me.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are places in life you just want to be. This is one of
them for me.''
</P>
<P>
   It also might be characterized as the biggest gamble of all for
Daly. A huge loss here, and he might never recover. To see Daly go
off the handle and score a 12 on the Road Hole or spend an hour
trying to hack out of Hell Bunker would surprise nobody this week.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he has an exemption to play on the PGA Tour until
2005 because of his win here, Daly seems to know he now has nobody
who will pick him up except himself. And he's not sure he's
capable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be awesome if it was me and Tiger (Woods) coming down
the stretch on Sunday,'' Daly says. ``He's going to be there. And I
guess it's possible I could be on a flight home by then, though not
if I can help it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Daly hasn't been able to help two busted marriages. He
hasn't been able to help tossing away millions of dollars to
gambling. He hasn't been able to help the brain cells lost to binge
drinking for all those years.
</P>
<P>
   However, there are signs that all is not lost. Daly has lost a
few pounds (30, he claims), and his father, Jim, is certain his son
has his life ``back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has always drawn strength from what happened here the last
time,'' Jim Daly says. ``I can tell you I haven't seen John so
happy and at peace with himself for a long time. All he wants now
is a couple of good performances on the golf course, and things
will be perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt the Old Course fits Daly just as well, and
maybe better, than it does Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can miss it left here all day,'' Daly says. ``You have the
whole of Scotland out there. And if me or Tiger mishit it, that's
usually where we end up (left).''
</P>
<P>
   Banking on Daly to make a turnaround this week is risky business
to be sure. In 2000, he's earned only $93,402. When you consider
his financial situation, it's barely enough to keep him in
Marlboros and greaseburgers.
</P>
<P>
   This is different, however. This is St. Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I walk out on that course, I feel like it was made for
me,'' Daly says. ``Winning the Open at St. Andrews was a total
blast. I love everything about it, even the wind and the rain.
(There has been none of either this week.) I have so much
confidence here. It could be my comeback. It's what I do from here
on that matters, not the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Except nobody believes Daly can avoid the flippant tantrum. It
seems every tournament includes something new for him, and without
exception, it has been bad.
</P>
<P>
   It's been as consistent as the seasons since his win here in
'95, when he survived the sensational chip-in from Costantino Rocca
and won in a playoff. The routine since then has included a time of
sobriety, a couple of more trips to sobriety clinics, and finally,
an admission to himself and the public last year that he was
drinking again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made three trips (total) to rehab, and they cost me $30,000
a visit,'' he says. ``They were only in it to make money. The AA
(meetings) were much better. But I don't think I need them anymore.
Besides, I am not an alcoholic. I don't drink every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have four, maybe five beers if I go out to dinner, although
it's a 12-pack when I'm at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Specialists might argue the point of what constitutes
alcoholism. Regardless, Daly says he's feeling better than he has
in years, and his golf game is coming around as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching a replay of the '95 Open, when I putted
beautifully, and I noticed my left foot was a lot further back than
it is now,'' Daly says. ``I have been trying that again for the
last three days and have been holing everything. So I feel pretty
good about my chances.''
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be Daly's motto. He's not unlike a jump shooter in
basketball. The next shot is always going in, even if he's missed
every one up to that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still standing,'' he says. ``My heart is still pumping.
All I want to do now is play golf and leave the rest to others.''
</P>
<P>
   And maybe make his stop at Scotland's Last Chance Saloon a
fruitful one.
