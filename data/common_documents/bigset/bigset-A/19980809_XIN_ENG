<HEADLINE> 11 Americans Confirmed Dead in Nairobi Bomb Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Eleven Americans are confirmed
dead while another 15 are hospitalized by Friday's bomb blast
rocking the Kenyan capital Nairobi, U.S. embassy spokesman Chris
Scharf told Xinhua Saturday Afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said 14 Kenyans working in the U.S. embassy also
died in the explosion.
</P>
<P>
The injured Americans were expected to be sent to South Africa
and Germany for further treatment, Scharf told Xinhua by phone.
</P>
<P>
"About 40 to 50 FBI (the U.S. Federal Bureau Investigation)
people are expected to arrive in Nairobi tomorrow (Sunday)
morning from Washington" to probe into the blast which according
to the lastest figure, killed more than 100 Kenyans and injured
about 4,200.
</P>
<P>
A few of U.S. FBI experts flew into Nairobi Saturday from
South Africa, according to Scharf.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the state-run Kenya Broadcast Corporation (KBC) said
that a group, self-declared the Islamic Army for the Liberation
of Muslim Holysites, had claimed to be responsible for the bomb
attack.
</P>
<P>
A wounded Eye-witness told Xinhua that just minutes before the
bomb blasted, she saw three persons, with a vehicle, tried to
enter the parking place between the U.S. embassy and the totally
destroyed building.
</P>
<P>
However, Scharf said the U.S. embassy has not received any
information like that.
</P>
<P>
Moments earlier, U.S. Ambassador to Kenya Prudence Bushnell
said the total death toll from the bombing should rise from 108,
the figure given previously by the Kenyan government, to more
than 130 if including the killed Americans and Kenyan employees
in the U.S. embassy.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Foreign Minister Bonaya Godana told foreign envoys in
Nairobi Saturday afternoon that 108 people were killed and 4,149
others injured in Friday's car bombing.
</P>
<P>
"Among our American employees, we have 10 confirmed dead and
five missing... Among our Kenyan employees, we have 14 dead and
109 missing," said Bushnell.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan police said they are probing the bomb blast which
is believed to be a terrorism attack aimed at the Americans.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Condemns Bomb Attacks in Kenya, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has expressed shock, horror and grief at the August 7
bomb attacks aimed at U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania which
claimed more than 130 lives and injured thousands of others.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued Saturday evening by the President's
Office said that Museveni described the terrorist attacks as
</P>
<P>
"senseless, inhuman and cowardly acts" in a telephone
conversation from Zimbabwe where he is attending a regional
summit.
</P>
<P>
The people of Uganda are horrified by these terrorist attacks
and join their brothers and sisters in Kenya and Tanzania as they
mourn their loved ones, the president said.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the Ugandan government and people, he expressed
his deepest sympathies and condolences to the families of the
deceased and injured, and assured the presidents of Kenya,
Tanzania and the United States of Uganda's solidarity and full
cooperation and assistance in tracking down those behind the bomb
attacks.
</P>
<P>
These attacks underline the importance and urgency of forging
a close-knit cooperation between the three sister east African
countries so that they form an invincible block against such
renegade and barbarous forces, Museveni added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that all right-thinking people of Africa and even
around the globe should work together to ensure that such
atrocities are eliminated from the earth and the perpetrators be
brought to book.

HANOI, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's Foreign Ministry has

<HEADLINE> More UK Companies Go Bust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Over 250 companies are going bust
each week in England and Wales of Britain, according to official
government figures.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Trade and Industry said that 3,346 companies
became insolvent in the UK in the second quarter of 1998, an
increase of 4.7 percent from the first quarter of this year or 6.4
percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The number of insolvencies is growing sharply against the
backdrop of a slowing-down of the UK economy. This indicates a
growing recession that is hitting the UK manufacturing sector,
some economists say.
</P>
<P>
Activity in the UK manufacturing sector fell to its lowest rate
for six years in July. According to the Chartered Institute of
Purchasing and Supply, the industry has contracted for the fourth
consecutive month, a factor which has prompted firms to cut
production.
</P>
<P>
Also, the government estimated that around 1.2 percent of
actively trading companies became insolvent in the 12 months to
July 1998. Individual insolvencies rose to 6,214, an increase of
2.2 percent from the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
However, not all companies that call in the receiver are closed
down. Some can be rescued and sold as a going business, according
to local media reports.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Controls Key Positions in  Mazar-i-Sharif </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia,
which marched into Mazar-i-Sharif Saturday, have secured key
positions in the city including the airport, government buildings
and road junctions.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban militia are now trying to flush out remaining
opposition troops in the city in a bid to take full control of the
stronghold of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban launched a major attack against Mazar-i-Sharif
Saturday morning and stormed into the city after breaking through
the opposition defenses.
</P>
<P>
Taliban sources from Mazar-i-Sharif said that a total of 5, 000
Taliban troops took part in Saturday's fighting which started from
Daulatabad area, about 40 kilometers north of the city. The
Taliban entered the city after midday following hours of intense
fighting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to media reports reaching here from
Mazar-i-Sharif Saturday afternoon the bulk of opposition forces
were fleeing south to the mountainous central massif of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Iranian News Agency (IRNA) said that
Mazar-i-Sharif, the only major Afghan city which was beyond the
Taliban's control, has been totally over-run by the Taliban
militia.
</P>
<P>
"The city fell moments ago and repeated explosions are being
heard in the city," IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
"There are only pockets of resistance, alliance officials have
left the town and people too are fleeing," it said, adding that
"parts of Mazar-i-Sharif are now burning and many homes have been
destroyed."
</P>
<P>
Taliban sources said that they used jet planes, conducting air
raids against the military targets of the Northern Alliance.
</P>
<P>
Relief agencies have already withdrawn from the city in fear of
the fighting after the Taliban captured Shiberghan, capital of
Jawzjan province last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It is the second time the Taliban have entered Mazar-i-Sharif.
The Taliban seized control of the city in May 1997 after joining
ranks with Abdul Malik, a former ally of opposition warlord Abdul
Rashid Dostam, who allowed them to enter the stronghold.
</P>
<P>
However, when a deal over power sharing broke down, Malik
returned to the fold of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance to
inflict brutal killings on at least 2,500 Taliban soldiers trapped
in the north.

<HEADLINE> 7 African Leaders Call for End to Congo War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Seven African Leaders including
President Laurent Kabila of Democratic Congo (DRC) Saturday
called for an end to the war in DRC and set up a panel to probe
charges that Rwanda and Uganda are backing the rebels there.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the end of a six-hour meeting in the Victoria
Falls, a resort town on Zimbabwe's northern border, host
President Robert Mugabe told a news conference that all the
delegates have agreed the on-going war in DRC must end and urged
those involved to lay down their arms.
</P>
<P>
"We want the fighting to stop and the situation to go back to
normalcy," Zambia News Agency ZANA quoted Mugabe as saying.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released after the meeting, the seven
presidents said they have established a four-nation committee,
comprising Zambia, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Tanzania, to probe all
the allegations, including that Rwanda and Uganda are involved in
the week-long military rebellion in the former Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"We will investigate all the allegations. But for us the
important thing is that the fighting is to put to an end," Mugabe
said.
</P>
<P>
The regional summit hosted by Mugabe attracted DRC's Kabila,
Zambia's Frederick Chiluba, Rwanda's Pasteur Bizimingu, Uganda's
Yoweri Museveni, Tanzania's Benjamin Mkapa and Namibia's Sam
Nujoma.
</P>
<P>
The DRC authorities have been accusing Rwanda and Uganda of
backing the week-long rebellion by the country's ethic Tutsi
Banyamulenge community aiming at toppling Kabila's new
government, which are denied by the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Energy Shortage in India May Worsen: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 8 (Xinhua) -- An Indian official said
Saturday that power supply situation in the country might further
worsen following anticipated slippage in the planned capacity
addition.
</P>
<P>
Union Power Secretary V. K. Pandit said in Bhubaneswar, capital
of the east coastal state of Orissa, that India was now facing an
energy shortage of 11.5 percent and peak time shortage of 18
percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the Press Trust of India, Pandit said that while
the Planning Commission had proposed a capacity addition of 30,358
MW for the eighth plan (1992-1997), the new capacity added during
the period was only 16,423 MW.
</P>
<P>
There was very little investment in transmission and
distribution sector resulting in poor grid supply conditions
leading to increased grid failures, Pandit said in a conference on
"Electricity regulation -- Role, Issues and Perspectives".
</P>
<P>
The fundamental problems besetting the power sector, he said,
were the existence of an irrational retail tariff structure, high
level of cross-subsidies, poor planning and operation, inadequate
capacity, neglect of the consumer, limited involvement of private
sector resources and expertise and absence of an independent
mechanism for regulating monopolistic tendencies.
</P>
<P>
Pandit said one of the reasons for power shortage was the poor
financial health of state power utilities and its further
deterioration during the eighth plan.

BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Millions of local residents along
the raging Yangtze River today continued to be busy protecting
their homes from devastating floods.
</P>
<P>
In the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, the water level at
the Jingjiang section, in central China's Hubei province, has kept
above the previous record set in 1954 and local officials have
made preparations for a possible diversion by blowing up the dykes
in the Gong'an county.
</P>
<P>
More than 300,000 residents have been working all day to tackle
emergency cases along the Jingjiang dykes, while in the downstream
city of Wuhan, seven million residents are preparing for a new
flood crest that has been formed because of torrential rains in
recent days.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the fourth flood crest on the Yangtze
River passed through the city of Yichang, also in Hubei, early
this morning. Fortunately, the city's 267 km of embankments stood
to the trial and remained intact.
</P>
<P>
Water levels at Yichang went down slowly today, and by 5:00
p.m. today, they were down to 53.21 m., down 0.7 m. from the
highest level, and the flow rate was down to 56,600 cu.m. per
second, down 4,900 cu.m. from the highest rate.
</P>
<P>
However, in the downstream provinces of Hunan and Jiangxi,
situation became even tougher. In Hunan's Dongting Lake, water
level rose to 35.54 metres at the Chenglingji Measuring Point,
0.23 metres higher than the historical record.

At present, nearly two million residents and 15,000 soldiers
have been stationed in the Dongting Lake area to safeguard the
weakened dykes and deal with emergency cases.
</P>
<P>
To date, the Jiangxi province has been confronted with the
severest challenge, as the levee in the industrial city of
Jiujiang partially collapsed Friday afternoon, with water gushing
in nearly one-seventh of the city area.
</P>
<P>
By 24:00 tonight, the breach has not been plugged yet although
painstaking efforts have been made. Flood-control experts and a
special contingent of the army have used some of the most advanced
anti-flood methods and expected to bring the situation under
control tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
According to Shu Shengyou, Governor of Jiangxi province, no
casualties have so far been reported in Jiujiang and life has
been by and large normal in urban Jiujiang.
</P>
<P>
So far, supplies of water, electricity and daily necessities
have been adequate as usual in the city.
</P>
<P>
In the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the provinces of
Anhui and Jiangsu have both been in the state of flood emergency
and about two million people and soldiers have been mobilized to
safeguard the dykes.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, more than 2,000 people have died
in the floods for the past two months and the death toll is still
on the rise. About 240 million people, a fifth of the total
population, have been affected by the floods.

NAIROBI, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Eleven people were killed
Saturday in a pre-dawn attack by armed Hutu rebels known as
Interahamwe militia in Kanama commune, north Rwanda.

"Eleven people were killed, while seven others were wounded,"
a senior army officer told RNA. The attack was carried out at
2:00 a.m (12:00 a.m) Saturday morning, the officer indicated.
</P>
<P>
The victims were hacked to death with clubs, machetes, and
other traditional weapons, the RNA said, in a dispatch to Xinhua

<HEADLINE> Jordanian FM Visits Iran on Jerusalem Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Foreign Minister Jawad
Anani said Muslim countries should, if necessary, consider even a
military option to prevent Israel's Judaizing Jerusalem, the
official Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark upon arrival in Tehran Saturday afternoon to
begin a three-day visit to discuss with Iranian officials regional
and international issues, particularly Israel's Jerusalem
expansion plan.
</P>
<P>
It sounds a little bit unusual for a Jordanian official to
highlight such an option. Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Anani said that Jerusalem concerns every Muslim state, and the
Islamic world should show appropriate reaction to the Israeli
conspiracy to Judaize the holy city.
</P>
<P>
As members of the Jerusalem Committee of the Organization of
the Islamic Countries (OIC), Iran and Jordan, which have discussed
the issue at the meeting of OIC foreign ministers in Morocco on
July 30, need further discussion, he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel, in the midst of an impasse of the Mideast peace
process, approved a plan on June 21 to extend Jerusalem's
authority to eight Jewish settlements in the West Bank, setting
off a storm of criticism inside and outside Israel.
</P>
<P>
Anani said that his talks with Iranian officials will also
cover other issues pertaining to the Islamic world, the Mideast
peace process, and ways to enhance bilateral cooperation in
economy, tourism and culture.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, who greeted
Anani at the Mehrabad International Airport, said the visit will
serve to further develop bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Iran broke off diplomatic ties during the 1980-88
Iran-Iraq war because of Jordan's siding with Iraq, but resumed
relations after the conflict ended.
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere has grown warmer since Mohammad Khatami became
Iran's president in May 1997, who tried to mend fences between
Iran and Arab states, including Jordan.
</P>
<P>
However, the two still disagree on the Mideast peace process.
Jordan is eager to play a constructive role in the process while
Iran firmly opposes to any peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Anani is scheduled to hold talks with Khatami
and Majlis Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy Says Angolan Visit Fruitful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- United Nations envoy Lakhdar
Brahimi said here Saturday that his eight-day visit to Angola has
achieved positive results.
</P>
<P>
The impact of the visit will be felt when talks between the
Angolan government and the opposition National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) are resumed in the next few days,
and the crisis to the peace process recedes, he told a press
conference here before concluding his visit.
</P>
<P>
During his visit in Angola, Brahimi has forwarded Annan's
letters to Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos and UNITA
chairman Jonas Savimbi. He also met with the troika missions of
United States, Russia and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Isaias Samakuva, head of UNITA delegation to the
joint committee of the Angola peace process, who left two months
ago, has returned to Luanda.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, United Nations Secretary-General Kofo Annan has
appointed Issa Diallo as U.N. special representative to Angola
after his predecessor Blondin Beye died in a plane crash on June
26.
</P>
<P>
However, Brahimi believed the situation in Angola is still
worrying. He called on the international community to continue
with its utmost efforts to bring the peace process back on its
course.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi arrived here on July 31 to start his visit aimed at
restoring the mutual trust between the Angolan government and
UNITA so as to ensure the unaccomplished tasks of the 1994 Lusaka
peace accord are completed.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy will also visit Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe
and Zambia to persuade leaders of the four countries to lend
their further support to the peace process in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The current crisis facing Angola is the worst since 1994 when
the two warring sides signed a peace agreement in Lusaka, Zambia,
ending the 19-year civil war, due to UNITA's failure to hand over
the four central cities under its control and its snatching over
of more cities which had already been under the government
control.

<HEADLINE> Tehran Stock Exchange Index Falls Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The general price index at Tehran
Stock exchange dropped by 17.00 points Saturday to close at
1518.94 points.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,712,245 shares changed hands in 605 deals and the
turnover was 4.59 billion rials (about 820,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
There were 17 gaining issues and eight decliners.
</P>
<P>
The slump came after a central bank official announced that the
country would face a foreign exchange deficit of about 3.5 billion
dollars in the current Iranian year (ended in March 21, 1999) due
to a fall in oil revenues.
</P>
<P>
The black money market also reacted quickly. Informed sources
said the greenback climbed to about 5,600 rials Saturday from
5,570 a week ago.
</P>
<P>
It was only on Sunday that President Mohammad Khatami announced
the government would keep the official rate of 3,000 rials against
a dollar through this Iranian year.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Rejects Duma's Move on Transfer of Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
Saturday resolutely denied a draft law submitted by the State
Duma, the lower house of parliament, on transferring the
president's powers to the prime minister in case it needs.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, in his message to Duma
speaker Gennady Seleznyov the president said that the draft law,
"on ensuring the continuity of presidential powers in cases when
Russian president is unable to carry out his duties," is
"conceptually unconstitutional and is not subject to further
consideration."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin noted that the draft law contains a mechanism of
temporary removal of the president from office, which is
prohibited by the constitution.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Article 92 of the Constitution allows the
prime minister to temporarily assume the functions of the head of
state only in exceptional cases when the president objectively
cannot carry out his duties.
</P>
<P>
Neither medical treatment in sanitariums or on resorts, nor a
vacation of the president fits this description, Yeltsin was
quoted by the presidential press service as saying.
</P>
<P>
He believed a long illness or treatment in hospital cannot be
considered as a sufficient argument compelling the head of state
to temporarily transfer his powers to the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
In Yeltsin's opinion, the provisions of the draft law run
counter to the Constitution. He thought an adoption of these
amendments would considerably tip the scales in favor of the
legislative branch, thus jeopardizing the constitutional system in
Russia.

<HEADLINE> PLC Postpones Vote on New Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Legislative
Council (PLC) decided Saturday to postpone its vote on the new
cabinet till Sunday, said a senior Palestinian official in
Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
The legislature decided to give more time to its members to
study the lineup of the new cabinet presented by Chairman Yasser
Arafat of the Palestinian National Authority, the official added.
</P>
<P>
Arafat sent the list of the reshuffled cabinet to the PLC for
approval Wednesday. The former cabinet resigned after being
charged of corruption and mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
However, the reshuffle was a far cry from an expected
overhaul. Not only did Arafat keep almost all the old faces, he
also introduced three more ministries and 10 new ministers,
bringing the total number of ministers, ministers of state and
ministers with or without portfolios to 30.
</P>
<P>
The new ministries are Environment, Parliamentary Affairs and
Prisoners Affairs.
</P>
<P>
However, former Higher Education Minister Hanan Ashrawi
rejected the new post and quited the cabinet on Thursday. She
criticized that the shakeup failed to send a strong message
against corruption and the new cabinet was incapable of dealing
with political pressures imposed on Palestinians by the current
Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Ashrawai also said that the new cabinet is unprofessional and
disunited.
</P>
<P>
Adbul Jawad Saleh, the former agriculture minister and a
minister without portfolio in the new lineup, also resigned on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has urged all lawmakers, particularly those from the his
Fatah faction, to vote in favor of the new cabinet, the official
said.

<HEADLINE> Congo Govt Troops Hit Back in West: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 8 (Xinhua) -- President Laurent Kabila have
sent troops to counter-attack rebels in the western ports near
the Atlantic Ocean, a report reaching here quoted an Interior
Ministry official as saying in Kinshasa Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Reinforcements had been sent to the oil town of Muanda by air
and road, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have begun a counter-attack at Muanda, contrary to what is
being said. The town has not fallen. What I know is that we are
continuing to send reinforcements on the ground," the official
who refused to be named, said.
</P>
<P>
"Planes carrying our troops are landing on the airfield at
Muanda so how can anyone say that at the same time the town is in
the hands of the aggressors?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
Kabila admitted Thursday that the eastern towns of Goma and
Bukavu were in rebel hands.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers from Democratic Congo's ethnic Tutsi Banyamulenge
community, whose 1996 revolt against late dictator Mobutu Sese
Seko grew into the bush war that brought Kabila to power,
launched the latest rebellion on August 2 in the eastern town of
Goma.
</P>
<P>
The rebels claimed Friday that their forces were advancing on
several fronts, including the port of Matadi, on the western
corridor cut through to the Atlantic by the Congo river, and the
southern town of Kalemie, gateway to copper-rich Shaba province.
</P>
<P>
Kabila accuses Rwanda, whose Tutsi-dominated army helped send
him to power, and Uganda of fomenting the revolt and of sending
troops to fight in Congo (K). Both countries denied involving in
the rebellion inside the central African nation.
</P>
<P>
Six African heads of state were meeting in crisis talks in
Zimbabwe to find ways of ending the conflict in Congo.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon, Iraq to Move toward Better Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 8 (Xinhua) -- In a significant move toward
improving relations, Lebanon and Iraq agreed that each will send a
civil servant to the other's capital, a Foreign Ministry source
said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This is seen as an important step since their diplomatic
relations were severed following the assassination of an Iraqi
opposition figure, Taleb Suhail al-Tamimi, in Beirut in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi diplomats were then convicted of murdering Tamimi and
expelled.
</P>
<P>
The source said the decision to exchange civil servant was made
after consultations between Lebanese Foreign Minister Fares Boueiz
and his Iraqi counterpart Mohammed Said al-Sahhaf.
</P>
<P>
The Voice of the People radio reported the Lebanese civil
servant will have no diplomatic status and his appointment was
believed desirable by Lebanese economic organizations that have
signed contracts with Iraq under the U.N. oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
The civil servant at the Lebanese embassy in Baghdad will be
charged of facilitating customs formalities in trade between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The source said the move does not constitute a step towards a
restoration of diplomatic ties with Baghdad, though Iraq has
repeatedly made such a demand.

<HEADLINE> 132 Dead, 4,257 Injured in Nairobi Bomb Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The latest figure for the bomb
blast in downtown Nairobi, capital of Kenya, is 132 people dead,
including 11 Americans, and 4,257 injured, a government spokesman
said Saturday evening here at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
At least 11 corpses have been found from the rubble of the
bomb blast since Saturday afternoon, in addition to two retrieved
alive, rescuers told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The rescue workers have managed to continuously communicate by
a microphone with the two trapped people -- one is in a lift,
another one behind a thick concrete wall, Avi Regev, the
spokesman for the Israeli rescue team, said at 8:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
As many as 180 soldiers from the Israeli Defense Force flew
into Nairobi from Israel at 2:00 p.m. local time and had started
to work in the rubble by 4:00 p.m., Regev said, adding that they
will work in shifts all night.
</P>
<P>
Now the rescuers planned to prop up some pillars to sustain
the wall while trying to provide oxygen to the trapped with the
aid of some special equipment, Regev said.
</P>
<P>
The workers will then send special-trained dogs, loaded with
foods for survival, inside the rubble to reach people, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, the outsiders will keep talking with the
trapped for psychological support.
</P>
<P>
"The work goes slow, because we have to work very patient and
very careful," he stressed, noting that even small negligence may
cause the falling of stones, resulting in the death of not only
the trapped but also the rescuers.
</P>
<P>
"We are still searching for more people," he said, adding that
he believed more people are still inside the debris.

<HEADLINE> Saudi, Egyptian FMs on Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Foreign Minister Prince
Saud Al-Faisal held talks Saturday with his Egyptian counterpart
Amr Moussa on the deadlocked Mideast peace process and the latest
Iraq-U.N. standoff.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, who paid a unscheduled visit to Saudi Arabia Saturday,
briefed the prince on the efforts made by Egypt and France to
revive the peace process, the Kuwait News Agency Kuna reported.
</P>
<P>
In May, Egypt and France put forward an initiative calling for
an international conference to reactivate the Mideast peace
process, which has been deadlocked due to Israel's intransigency.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed the Iraq-U.N. standoff after
Iraq decided Tuesday to suspend cooperation with the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) and International Atomic Energy Agency. The
two bodies are carrying out arms inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi decision came after talks between its Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz and UNSCOM Chairman Richard Butler broke down
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Both Moussa and Saud stressed the need for Iraq to comply with
all relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq after its invasion of
Kuwait, and began search for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq
soon after the 1991 Gulf War brought Iraq to its defeat.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions will not be lifted until the UNSCOM certifies
that Iraq has eliminated all banned weapons.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Beefs up Security Following Bomb Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government said in a
statement Saturday night that it has taken up measures to boost
security in all diplomatic areas, airports, ports and other
entrances of the country following Friday's bomb blast.
</P>
<P>
The explosion targeted at the U.S. embassy in downtown Nairobi
has so far claimed 132 lives with 4,257 people injured, including
11 Americans, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
As many as 53 buildings near the bombing area were damaged at
various degrees, said the statement which went on to warn people
to keep away from those unsafe areas.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers have dugged out 11 corpses in the rubble since
Saturday afternoon and another two are proved to be alive but
still trapped deeply inside.
</P>
<P>
The government has allocated 50 million Shillings (some
850,000 U.S. Dollars) as the emergency fund for the tragedy,
according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement condemned the bomb attack, saying it broke out
without any warnings in advance.
</P>
<P>
A c-130 aircraft carrying 44 U.S. personnel with medical
supplies, food and communications equipment landed early
Saturday, while a c-1241 touched down shortly after 9.00 a.m.
with more medical equipment, said U.S. Air Force Major Neal
Kringel.
</P>
<P>
A British assistance team will arrive here Sunday to help the
government deal with the blast, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Urges Stop of Foreign Support in Afghan War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkey on Saturday called for a
stop of foreign aid of weapons and personnel to any of the warring
fractions in Afghanistan to help end the devastating civil war.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Foreign Ministry made the call in a statement. It
said Turkey is gravely concerned that the worsening situation in
Afghanistan can cause further bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
Turkey hoped the conflicting sides will return to the
negotiating table and finally achieve a ceasefire soon, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that "Turkey believes that a lasting peace in
Afghanistan could only be provided with the establishment of a
government where all groups will be represented."
</P>
<P>
Ankara also expresses concerns over human rights violations in
Afghanistan against to women and children.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey believes that Taliban militia should provide facilities
to the continuation of the efforts of international aid
organizations to bring humanitarian aid to Afghanistan under
severe conditions," the statement stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban Saturday captured the last major city of
Mazar-e-Sharif, dealing a heavy blow to its rival Northern
Alliance, headed by ousted President Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, a student militia believed to be supported by
Pakistan, has won control over more than two thirds of country
after driving Rabbani's government out of the capital Kabul in
September 1996.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between Taliban and the Northern Alliance have been
deadlocked since May and fightings have since flared up again.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The death toll of the
bombing of the United States embassy in Tanzania has risen to
nine, sources at the Muhimbili Medical Center said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Professor Samuel Masele, the director general of the hospital,
said 15 others are still in the hospital, which has enough
supplies of medicine and medical instrument.
</P>
<P>
One more person succumbed to their injuries Saturday and more
than 70 people were also injured in the blast, it is learned.
</P>
<P>
Masele said the hospital received Saturday a consignment of
medicine worth 20 million Shillings (about 29,800 U.S. Dollars)
donated by various organizations.
</P>
<P>
For example, the Family Planning donated some 9,000 gloves for
the medical personnel, while the World Health Organization (WHO)
donated uniforms for theater staff.
</P>
<P>
Abbas Gulamali, the Kilombero member of parliament, has
donated 300,000 Shillings (about 477 U.S. Dollars) for buying
sutures.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Vice-President Omar Ali Juma inspected the wrecked
embassy Saturday, saying he was deeply shocked by the "inhuman"
incident that happened in a peaceful country like Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Juma said the government will give full support to the
investigation into the incident which was caused by a blast of an
oil tanker outside the embassy on Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
So far, traffic around the heavily-guarded embassy compound
has come back to normal as rescue work almost came to an end.

NICOSIA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen Cypriot firefighters
left Saturday for Greece to help battle raging forest fires there,
including a wall of flames that are closing in on the ancient site
of the Olympic games.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made during a Council of Ministers' meeting
Friday, Cypriot government sources said.
</P>
<P>
Greek Justice and Public Order Minister George Romeos has
thanked the Cypriot government for its practical help.
</P>
<P>
Hot weather and lack of rain have made easy the spread of
forest fire and rendered it very difficulty to put out the flames,
which threatened to turn part of the country into a furnace.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Turkish Cypriot-controlled
north and Greek Cypriot-dominated south since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took the north third of Cyprus in the wake
of abortive coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Greece has since been a strong supporter of the Greek
Cypriot-dominated Cypriot government and the two governments have
kept close ties.
</P>
<P>
So far, Italy and France have sent firefighting aircraft and
personnel to Greece.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda to Cooperate With 4-Nation Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimungu Saturday said Rwanda will cooperate with a four-nation
committee to probe the allegations that his country and Uganda
are backing the rebellion in Democratic Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Speaking to journalists at Lusaka International Airport here
after returning from Saturday's emergent summit held in
Zimbabwe's resort town of Victoria Falls, Bizimungu said Rwanda
will cooperate with the committee members to ensure a peaceful
solution to the problem in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The committee set up during the meeting comprises Zambia,
Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Namibia. It will probe the allegations
made by Kinshasa that the two eastern neighbors of DRC have got
involved in the one-week long rebellion to topple President
Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
However, both Rwanda and Uganda have denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
"We will create a conducive atmosphere for the committee to
carry out its investigations and also try to give a chance for
peace," said Bizimungu.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan president joined his wife here and flew back to
his country. He arrived in Zambia Wednesday for a three-day state
visit and left for Zimbabwe with Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba for the regional summit Friday.
</P>
<P>
Seven presidents from Zimbabwe, Zambia, Tanzania, Namibia,
Rwanda and Uganda as well as the DRC attended the summit and they
have agreed that the on-going war in DRC must end and urged those
involved to lay down their arms.
</P>
<P>
However, political analysts said in the Victoria Falls that
there is no sign of a breakthrough and that the confrontation
between Kabila and his former backers is likely to continue.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here Saturday said troops loyal to Kabila
have launched a counter-attack in the west on the strategic river
corridor linking the capital Kinshasa to the sea.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Says Not to Bow to Threats on Missile Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Defense Minister
Yiannakis Omirou said Saturday that his government will not give
in to pressures and threats over the planned purchase of Russian
missiles.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to new recruits to the National Guard at a Larnaca
army camp, Omirou said his government's position and that of
pro-government political parties are well known, and that is "We
will never operate under blackmail or pressure."
</P>
<P>
Omirou called on all countries concerned about security and
stability in the region to exercise pressure on Turkey instead of
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"We are a power of peace, stability, security and cooperation
in the region and those third parties who want to create the
impression that we are part of a game of tension will be proved
wrong," he said.
</P>
<P>
Omirou said the National Guard will safeguard peace, and "if we
are provoked we will defend the rights of Cypriot Hellenism until
the end."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus clinched a deal with Russia early last year to buy the
surface-to-air S-300 missile system, which is due to be delivered
and deployed later this year.
</P>
<P>
This is seen as a threat by Turkish Cypriots in northern Cyprus
and Turkey, which has threatened pre-emptive strike if the
missiles are deployed.
</P>
<P>
Some foreign governments, especially the U.S. and Britain,
have also voiced opposition to Cyprus' decision.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into Turkish Cypriot-controlled
north and Greek Cypriot-dominated south since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the north third of the island in
the wake of a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a breakaway
state in northern Cyprus, which is recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored peace talks toward a solution to the
long-running Cyprus issue broke down last summer after the Turkish
Cypriots walked out of the negotiations to protest against a
European Union decision to start membership talks with Cyprus, not
their supporter Turkey.

NAIROBI, August 8 (Xinhua) -- A Kenyan man trapped in the
rubble of Friday's bomb blast got out to safety Saturday night
after one and half days of tense work by rescuers.
</P>
<P>
A huge car bomb explosion brought down the whole building on
the rear of the U.S. embassy, crashing down around the man who is
identified as Gatili Nganga.
</P>
<P>
The man was said at his middle age and was injured quite
seriously. At least one more person was still alive in the
debris.
</P>
<P>
The latest government figure for the bomb blast is 132 people
dead, including 11 Americans, and 4,257 injured.
</P>
<P>
At least 11 corpses have been found from the rubble of the
bomb blast since 4:00 p.m. local time, rescuers told Xinhua.

<P>
The rescue workers had managed to communicate continuously by
a microphone with Nganga and the other trapped person, said Avi
Regev, the spokesman for the Israeli rescue team which flew in
earlier Saturday.
</P>
<P>
As many as 180 soldiers from the Israeli Defense Force flew

The rescuers first planned to prop up some pillars to sustain
the wall while trying to provide oxygen to the trapped with the
aid of some special equipment, Regev said.
</P>

"The work goes slow, because we have to work very patient and
very careful," he stressed, noting that even small negligence may
cause the falling of stones, resulting in the death of not only

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Turkey Not to Release More Water to Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has no intention to
increase Euphrates water supply to Syria to solve their
long-running water row, the Turkish Daily News reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The flow of more water to Syria is the natural result of the
accelerated electricity generation at Turkey's Ataturk Dam over
the Euphrates River, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
According to Turkey's State Water Affairs Institution, an
average of 989.4 cubic Euphrates water was released to Syria every
second in the first seven months in 1998, much higher than the 500
cubic meters per second limit Ankara lets flow to Syria from its
Ataturk Dam.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a unnamed expert from the institution as
saying that "in order to produce more electricity, more water is
required," and this does not mean Turkey has soften its stance on
its water dispute with Syria.
</P>
<P>
The water distribution of the Euphrates, which originates in
Turkey and flows toward Syria and Iraq, has been an entrenched
dispute among the three countries.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Syria signed a protocol in 1987, under which Turkey
got 500 cubic meters of Euphrates water a second and the two were
supposed to reach a new agreement on a new, higher Syrian share
once the Ataturk Dam was completed.
</P>
<P>
The dam was finished in 1991 but no new agreement has been
hammered out to date because their strained relations have prevent
a dialog.
</P>
<P>
Turkey accuses Syria of sheltering leader of its outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party and (PKK) Abdullah Ocalan, and of providing
support for the PKK, which has been fighting a 14-year war for
independence in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Syria and Iraq have been lobbying the Arab world to
pressure Turkey to release more water to them.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The government of Canada Saturday
called on the citizens of the Caribbean island of Nevis not to
vote to secede from their federation with Saint Kitts.
</P>
<P>
The Nevis Administration is preparing to hold a public
referendum on August 10, the ultimate result of which could be the
secession of Nevis from the two-island federation of Saint Kitts
and Nevis, if the threshold of at least two thirds of all valid
votes is met, as required by the constitution of Saint Kitts and
Nevis.
</P>
<P>
"As a friend of the Caribbean Community and Common Market,
Canada has been closely watching developments in the Caribbean
state of Saint Kitts and Nevis," said Foreign Affairs Minister
Lloyd Axworthy in a release published Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Canada firmly believes that in this age of global integration,
strength in all regions of the world is born of unity and closer
cooperation, not division and fragmentation," he added.
</P>
<P>
The government of Canada supports initiatives by the
populations and governments of Saint Kitts and Nevis to resolve
political differences through democratic processes based on the
rule of law, and strongly encourages ongoing efforts to find legal
alternatives to secession by Nevis, said the release.

<HEADLINE> Iranians Detained in Taliban-Captured Afghan City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranians in the Afghan city of
Mazar-e-Sharif captured by the Taliban militia Saturday have been
detained, the Iranian official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats in the Iranian consulate in the city and an IRNA
correspondent, have all been taken into custody, said the people,
who introduced themselves as Taliban militiamen in answering a
call to the consulate.
</P>
<P>
The IRNA report did not mention how many Iranians remained in
the consulate in the city when it captured by the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Early Saturday morning, the Taliban captured Mazar-e-Sharif,
the main stronghold of the Northern Alliance headed by ousted
Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani, dealing a severe blow to its
rival.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, a student militia believed to be support by
Pakistan, drove Rabbani's government out of the capital Kabul in
September 1996 and has won control over more than two thirds of
the country.
</P>
<P>
It has since imposed a strict form of Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
U.N.-sponsored peace talks between Taliban and the Northern
Alliance broke down in May and the Taliban resumed attack on area
under the alliance's control.
</P>
<P>
Iran, which supports the Northern Alliance, has withdrawn its
ambassador to Afghanistan early this week.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi has
said Tehran held Pakistan and the Taliban responsible for the
safety of Iranian diplomats in Mazar-e-Sharif.

<HEADLINE> No Military Solution to Afghan Crisis: Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi said here Saturday that the Afghan crisis has no military
solution and can only be settled through political means.
</P>
<P>
It was Iran's first reaction to the fall of Mazar-e-Sharif, the
main stronghold of the Northern Alliance headed by Afghan
President Burhanuddin Rabbani, to the hands of the Afghan Taliban
militia Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
Receiving Jordanian Foreign Minister Jawad al-Anani at the
airport, Kharrazi said the fact is that the Taliban have attained
successes in Afghanistan with support from certain foreign
governments.
</P>
<P>
Iran holds Pakistan and the Taliban responsible for the safety
of Iranian diplomats in Mazar-e-Sharif, the official news agency
IRNA quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, a student militia believed to have the support of
Pakistan, has won control over more than two thirds of Afghanistan
and since imposed a strict form of Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
Tehran has been supporting the Northern Alliance, which
suffered a heavy blow with Taliban's seizure of Mazar-e-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
However, Kharrazi said, in case of Taliban's control of entire
Afghanistan, the ethnic minorities should continue to survive and
are entitled to a share in the destiny of their country.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi has voiced Tehran's strong opposition to any foreign
military intervention in Afghanistan on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He called on all countries, including Afghanistan's neighbors,
to try to persuade the belligerent parties to engage in serious
negotiation.
</P>
<P>
He warned that Iran cannot allow security of this sensitive
region to be played with and become a tool of others for their
ambitions.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Urged to Increase Exports to Cut Deficit With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh should increase its
exports to India by further devaluing its currency, stopping
smuggling and seeking reductions in tariff and non-tariff
barriers, so as to narrow down its huge trade gap with its giant
neighbor, an expert said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
And more Indian investments in Bangladesh should be encouraged,
and SAPTA (South Asian Preferential Trading Arrangement) made more
operational and meaningful, Dr Kabir Hassan, an associate
professor of a U.S. university and a research fellow of American
Institute of Bangladesh Studies told a seminar here on
"Indo-Bangla Trade."
</P>
<P>
The seminar was organized by the Center for Development and
Research of Bangladesh and the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers
of Commerce and Industry (FBCCI).
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has run a huge deficit of at least 2 billion U.S.
dollars in terms of both formal and informal cross-border trade
with India, according to FBCCI President Yussuf Abdullah Harun.
</P>
<P>
Over 25 percent of Bangladesh's total imports came from India
which has only 0.5 percent of its imports from Bangladesh, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh exports mainly chemical and allied products to India
and imports textile and textile-related raw materials from that
country.
</P>
<P>
Joint-venture projects in such fields as agro-processing, light
industries, coal, telecommunications, power and tourism under
buy-back arrangements, suppliers credit from India under easy
terms, and joint development of infrastructure might contribute to
offsetting the current trade imbalance, the FBCCI chief said.
</P>
<P>
"The huge trade imbalance is a result of inappropriate
exchange-rate policy on behalf of Bangladesh," Dr Hassan observed.
The international inconvertibility of the currencies of SAARC
(South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) members
countries was hindering trade among them, he added.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Secretary Sayed Alamgir Farrouk Chowdhury urged
Bangladeshi businessmen to "shift their focus of attention from
the European and American countries to India and create market
through persuasion and improvement of standard of local products."
The U.S. is now the largest trading partner of Bangladesh,
followed by Germany.

With regard to prisoner releases, Mowlam repeated concerns that
"any releases should be kept under review, and any ceasefire has
to be complete and unequivocal," he said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the LVF, Three other groups, all Republicans
fighting for an end of British rule in the province, have also

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Inspects Yangtze River Embankment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINGZHOU, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji today
urged all provinces along the Yangtze River to remain highly
vigilant and go all out in fighting the floods to ensure the
safety of the main Yangtze River embankment.
</P>
<P>
Zhu spoke during an inspection tour of the embankment at
Jingzhou City in central China's Hubei Province as millions of
people, including soldiers, are fighting the rampaging floods,
China's most severe since 1954.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of President Jiang Zemin, the Central Committee of
the Communist Party of China and the State Council, Zhu extended
warm regards and sincere thanks to flood-fighters.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of tens of thousands of soldiers for their
remarkable role in fighting the floods. The soldiers have always
rushed to the rescue in places of danger, he said, adding that it
demonstrates once again that the People's Liberation Army is
the Chinese people's own army.
</P>
<P>
At present, Zhu said, the flood situation is very serious on
the Yangtze River. There is a high possibility of cave-ins and
crumbling along the main river dikes because of the long soaking
period. In addition, more rainfall and new flood crests are
expected to come from the upper reaches of the Yangtze, Zhu
said.
</P>
<P>
He urged people fighting the floods to surmount all
difficulties and persevere to the end.
</P>
<P>
Leadership at all levels should organize patrols along the
river dikes, put their emphasis on key river sections, and send
more troops, armed police and public security officers if
necessary, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu urged local governments to place people's lives above all,
telling them to move the people to safer places, take good care of
their daily lives and send more medical teams to flood-afflicted
areas.
</P>
<P>
In the past two days, Zhu toured the Jingjiang, Shishou and
Honghu sections, the most dangerous parts of the Yangtze, where he
listened to the reports of local government officials.

<HEADLINE> Angola Endeavors to Increase Oil Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Minister of Petroleum
Albina Assis has said the country will work hard to increase oil
production to use the revenue to develop agriculture and
industry.
</P>
<P>
The country cannot create a large number of jobs and produce
more national products without the development of agriculture and
industry, she said in a speech carried by Sunday's Angola Daily.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, she said, Angola's daily oil production is 735,000
barrels. The number will grow to a daily one million barrels in
the next century with the discovery of a serious of new oil
fields with rich reserves, she added.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Assis said, 53 percent of the country's oil
production comes from Cabinda Province, an enclave to the north
of Angola. The rest is mostly offshore oil from the Bay of Congo.
</P>
<P>
The minister predicted that the oil production will increase
remarkably between the year 1999 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Eld Petroleum Corporation of France discovered three big
oil fields near Luanda last year, with oil reserves being 735
million barrels, 660 million barrels and 700 million barrels
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Regarding problems now facing the oil industry, she said, the
country's relevant legislature is too rigid and simple, and
cannot fit the current situation. He called for the reform of
the government in order to attract more foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the minsiter noted, since the monthly government
expenditure on fuel subsidy is as much as two million U.S.
Dollars, the priority should be given to the reduction of the
subsidy so that more capital will be used on re-investment in the
state-owned petroleum company, the Sonangol, and the
rehabilitation of its infrastructure.

<P>
TEHRAN, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami Sunday called on the Islamic countries to close their
ranks to confront the Israeli expansionist policies, Tehran radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
Receiving visiting Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign
Minister Jawad Anani, Khatami termed Israel as the biggest enemy
of Islam and the mankind, saying unity among Islamic nations is
the only way to confront the Israeli expansion.
</P>
<P>
He expressed concern over the establishment of Israeli bases
in the region, saying that "national interests oblige us to
confront the Israeli expansion more seriously."
</P>
<P>
Terming the Islamic countries as the strongest and richest
nations from the points of cultural heritage, suitable geographic
positions and rich natural resources, Khatami said these
advantages should be explored for solidarity among the Islamic
countries.
</P>
<P>
He expressed regret over the current situation of Muslims in
the world, saying that massacres, killings and robberies are still
seen in Afghanistan and "what more concerns us is that all of
these things happened under the name of Islam."
</P>
<P>
Underlining the need of unity and solidarity among Muslim
nations, he said that the Islamic countries should cooperate with
each other in the path of development.
</P>
<P>
Anani, who arrived here Saturday and handed over a written
message from King Hussein to Khatami, voiced his country's
readiness to expand relations with Iran.
</P>

Jordan attaches importance to friendly, good and lasting
contacts with Iran, Anani said.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official: No New Meetings With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian side has
decided not to continue direct talks with Israel due to its
insincerity over redeployment issue, a senior Palestinian official
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat announced the decision
in an interview with the Voice of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said "we do not want to get the peace process into mere
talks and giving Israel additional miles or more chances since we
hope for reaching an implementation of agreements and not only to
talk about peace without adopting practical measures."
</P>
<P>
Direct talks between the Palestinians and Israel resumed July
19 after a lapse of 16 months.
</P>
<P>
But the talks have achieved little progress because of the big
gap between the two sides over the scope of Israeli troops
redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side insisted that Israel accept a
U.S. initiative over the redeployment, which calls on Israel to
hand over 13 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
But Israel wanted to make a change in the formula, proposing a
handback of 10 percent, with the other 3 percent turned into a
"nature reserve," in which the Palestinians are not allowed to
build new houses and even free access.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians rejected the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said "the Israeli ideas are outside the terms of
references for signed agreements or even for the U.S. initiative."
</P>
<P>
"On its part, the Palestinian leaership refused these ideas
since they are neither new nor serious," he said.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said Palestinian National Authority President Yasser
Arafat exchanged three letters with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright over the past three days to discuss the current
direct talks.
</P>
<P>
In his letters, Arafat briefed Albright on the outcome of the
lastest peace talks, saying Israel did not present any new ideas
on the redeployment and demanding the U.S. publicize its
initiative, Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
Washington has so far not publicized the initiative due to
Israel's insistence.
</P>
<P>
In the letters, Arafat also reiterated the commitment of the
Palestinian leadership to the U.S. initiative and to the sincere
and faithful implementation of signed agreements, he added.
</P>
<P>
In her replies, Erekat said, Albright still urged the two sides
to maintain direct talks, saying there is still hope.

<P>
MOSCOW, August 9 (Xinhua) -- No explosives were found on a
Russian TU-154 aircraft hijacked Sunday with 97 passengers on
board, the Interior Ministry department based in the local
Domodedovo airport said.
</P>
<P>
All the passengers who took the Irkutsk-Tyumen-Moscow flight
are now out of danger in the airport's VIP lounge, the Interfax
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
This contradicts an earlier report by the airport's security
chief, quoted by Interfax, that terrorists were still holding 70
people hostage on board the plane.
</P>
<P>
The FSB's special Alfa commando, and units from the Interior
Ministry, the Air Force and the Ministry for Emergency Situations
have left the airport, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Federal Security Service (FSB) servicemen, however, are
searching and questioning the passengers to identify the author of
hand-written note that threatened to blow up the aircraft unless
100,000 U.S. dollars was provided.
</P>
<P>
The handwriting of each passenger is being compared with the
note to trace down the terrorist who is obviously among the
passengers.
</P>
<P>
It was initially reported that only one man hijacked the plane,
but the FSB said later there might be two terrorists aboard.
</P>
<P>
Interfax quoted airport management as saying that the
situation is under control and the airport continues to operate as
usual.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Tu Guangshao, general manager of
the Shanghai Stock Exchange, said here today that China's stable
economic growth is of the greatest importance to the healthy
development of the country's stock market during the Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a ceremony at which the Shanghai Stock Exchange
signed contracts with 30 listed companies, Tu said China's two
stock exchanges, in Shanghai and Shenzhen, have gone up 10 percent
and 2 percent respectively, despite the downturn of markets in
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the healthy development of China's stock market
to high growth and low inflation, and said the securities
management departments have also promulgated a series of measures
to boost the stock market.
</P>
<P>
Since the latter half of last year, a number of large
state-owned enterprises playing an important role in the national
economy have been listed on the exchanges, said Tu, adding that
the 30 companies listed this year are expected to realize returns
of 30 percent more than the average.
</P>
<P>
Referring to those securities investment funds which were
successively listed this year, Tu said they have raised funds
totaling 10 billion yuan (about 1.2 billion U.S. dollars), which
not only improved the investment structure, but also offered
support to the stock market.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait expressed concern
Sunday over the latest crisis between Iraq and the United Nations
triggered by Iraq's suspension of cooperation with U.N. weapons
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
This was Kuwait's first official reaction to the new
development, which was made during a weekly cabinet session.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's Interior Minister and acting Minister of State for
Cabinet Affairs, Mohammad Khaled Al-Sabah said after the
session that the council of ministers regarded the Iraqi move as a
violation to the U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi move threatened the region's security and stability,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti government called on the international community to
press the Iraqi regime to bring about its compliance with the
U.N. resolutions, Al-Sabah said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced last Wednesday that it would suspend
cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on disarming
Iraq of the weapons of mass destruction and the International
Atomic Energy Agency unless the U.N. lifts the sanctions imposed
on Iraq after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Iraq adopted the move after the talks on weapons inspections
between Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz and UNSCOM chief
Richard Butler broke down last Tuesday.

TEHRAN, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Majlis (Parliament)
Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri Sunday strongly lashed out at the
Afghan Taliban militia for capturing 11 Iranian diplomats in
northern Afghanistan, Tehran radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Majlis open session, Nouri expressed regret on
the issue, saying "we consider such an action as a hostile stance
against the Islamic Republic of Iran."
</P>

The Iranian diplomats were captured by the Taliban forces in
Mazari Sharif Saturday after they took over the city, the main
stronghold of the Northern Alliance headed by President
Burhanuddin Rabbani.

The Iranian Foreign Ministry summoned Pakistani Ambassador to
Tehran Javid Husain, urging the Pakistani government and the
Taliban to ensure the safety of the Iranian diplomats and to
release them as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Nouri said that arresting diplomats is an "unjustifiable act
against the international laws," stressing that Iran hopes the
Taliban would put an end to such an act as quickly as possible.

<P>
He also urged the Iranian Foreign Ministry to take urgent
measures to free the Iranian diplomats.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Legislators Approve New PNA Cabinet  (by Tan Xinmu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Despite dissatisfaction of
some of its members, the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC)
voted Sunday to approve the new cabinet of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
In the West Bank city of Ramallah, the 88-seat PLC endorsed
with a vote of 55-28 the lineup of the PNA cabinet presented last
week by PNA President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The vote had been scheduled for Saturday, but was delayed at
the request of 30 PLC members who wanted to address the
legislature regarding the new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet reshuffle, that had been delayed for about one
year, sparked strong criticism from some PLC members who noted
that most of the ministers accused of corruption retained their
seats in the new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
It was the charges of corruption and mismanagement that led to
the demand by the PLC for the latest cabinet reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Arafat appointed 10 new ministers to the old 18-member cabinet,
most of whom come from the mainstream Fatah faction led by Arafat.
</P>
<P>
In a sign of rebuke to Arafat, Hanan Ashrawi, one of prominent
Palestinian political figures on the international stage,
announced resignation Thursday from the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Ashrawi rejected the offer of being transferred to another post
in the cabinet, charging Arafat for failing to tackle the
widely-reported corruption and mismanagement of the peace talks
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Another minister Abdul Jawad Salah also resigned the same day
to protest what he termed the Palestinian leader's failure to
deal with the internal problems of the PNA.
</P>
<P>
Ashrawi was transferred from the Higher Education Ministry to
the Tourism Ministry in the reshuffle, while Salah, who was
Agriculture Minister, was made a minister without portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, Arafat convened several meetings of the Fatah
bloc in the PLC to coordinate their positions on Sunday's vote.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Fatah legislators to vote for the new cabinet so
that the Palestinians could proceed with what he described as
their most important challenge - the establishment of an
independent Palestinian state next May.

SHASHI, August 9 (Xinhua) -- By 7:00 pm this evening, the water
level of the Yangtze River at Shashi City had dropped to 44.65
meters from this year's record level of 44.95 meters set at 4:00

The water velocity has slowed from 47,100 cubic meters per
second, recorded at 1:00 am today, to 45,900 cubic meters per second
at present.
</P>
<P>
The falling water level was attributed to the abandonment of some
secondary dikes, including one at Jianli County which was destroyed
at 12:00 am today, and the passing of the fourth flood crest, the
official said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Want Resident Participation in Urban Planning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Several young Chinese scientists
today advised city dwellers to participate in urban planning for
the next century as part of a strategy for sustainable development
long advocated by Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 urban planning specialists exchanged views on
urban sustainable development at a forum for young scientists here
today sponsored by the China Association of Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
Some of the participants pointed out that urban plans
should be made not only by government and experts, but also by
the city residents themselves.
</P>
<P>
"Residents' life demand should be taken into account when
making city plans. Residents have the biggest say whether a city
has vigor, and whether it is sustainable," said Wu Chengzhao of
the College of Architecture and Planning at Tongji University in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Wu said some cities are densely populated and constructed
monotonously with little greenery and space set aside for outdoor
activities, a potentially unhealthy situation.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than 50 percent of young Chinese
urbanites are dissatisfied their leisure time, and over 700,000
residents of Shanghai, China's largest commercial city, suffered
from depression in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"Planning a sustainable city needs the views of people from all
walks of life, including experts, and scientific and rational
design, as well perceptive suggestions from the residents," said
Doctor Gong Jianhua of the Department of Geography at the Chinese
University of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Gong is trying to design a future Hong Kong, using computer
virtual reality technology, in order to help Hong Kong residents
make suggestions about the city's future construction plans.
</P>
<P>
He said that residents will be able to enter into the virtual
Hong Kong through the Internet. In the virtual Hong Kong,
scientific concepts of ecology and sustainability have been
translated into models. Residents may judge whether a plot of
grass, a building, or a street is acceptable. Then experts and
policy-makers will receive the suggestions via computer.
</P>
<P>
Gong said he once was surprised by a slogan about sustainable
development in a remote Chinese village. "No matter how much the
villagers understand about sustainable development, the concept
has been widely spread in China."
</P>
<P>
Gong said he has great confidence that Chinese residents will
help engage in urban planning in the next century.

<HEADLINE> More South Korean Firms Trying to Avoid Layoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 9 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of South
Korean companies are trying to avoid laying off its workers by
reducing working hours, stopping production temporarily and
retraining redundant workers, a survey released by the Labor
Ministry Sunday said.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, such measures helped some
242,000 workers keep their jobs.
</P>
<P>
The number of companies now trying to avoid layoffs marked a
four-fold rise last month from the average number in the first six
months of the year, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a monthly average of 257 companies received
government assistance for taking measures to avoided layoffs.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government provides financial assistance to
ailing companies which promised not to lay off workers in a bid to
reduce unemployment since the nation started suffering a financial
crisis triggered by corporate bankruptcies and bad loans of
financial institutions late last year.
</P>
<P>
The number of firms receiving financial assistance from the
government to avoid layoffs hit 1,045 last month.
</P>
<P>
Companies which do not fire workers are given enough funds to
train them for six months.
</P>
<P>
For small and medium-sized companies, the amount of financial
aid is equivalent to two thirds of wages paid to an employee
during the employment maintenance period. For large companies,
the aid amount is one half of the wage.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, some 82 percent of managers and
workers have agreed to take pay cuts or wage freezes for this year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of July this year, a total of 3,337 companies
concluded their annual wage negotiations with labor unions,
according to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Among them, 2,738 firms reached deals with labor unions,
agreeing to pay reductions or wage freezes, while only 18 percent
of the total decided to raise wages.
</P>
<P>
Layoffs are new to South Korean workers, who are used to a
guarantee of life-long employment after layoffs were legalized in
February this year.
</P>
<P>
The nation's unemployment rate shot up to 7 percent last month
with more than 1.5 million people jobless.

<HEADLINE> 49,000 Held in Nigerian Prisons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- A total of 49,000 inmates, made up
of convicts and those awaiting trials are being held in prisons
across Nigeria, Nigeria's prison authority said.
</P>
<P>
According to Alhaji Ibrahim Mohammed Jarma, the Comptroller-General
of Prisons, the capacity of the prisons in Nigeria is for 28,000
prisons.
</P>
<P>
Besides congestions, he said, the prisons also lacked
workshops for training inmates with a view to reforming them for
a gainful livelihood at the end of their terms of imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, ex-convicts were rejected by the society
and they always went back to crime and eventually into prison.
</P>
<P>
Jarma further disclosed that few training workshops have been
converted into prison cells to create space for the ever growing
number of inmates, the official New Nigerian reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to expand the present capacity of the
prisons.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the newspaper said a training workshop
on human rights and prison systems in Nigeria will be held from
August 11 to 13 in Kaduna State, in north Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The workshop will be jointly organized by the National Human
Rights Commission, the International Committee of Red Cross and
the Nigerian Prison Services, the report said.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Exports Expected to Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The economic research institutes of
South Korean family-owned conglomerates, or chaebols, predicted
that the nation's exports will fall roughly 10 percent in the
second half of this year from last year.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, they said the current account surplus will
drop from 22.4 billion U.S. dollars in the first half of this year
to some 20 billion U.S. dollars in the second half.
</P>
<P>
They attributed the gloomy exports prospects to rising value of
the won against the greenback, the weakening Japanese yen, growing
worries over the U.S. economy, and economic setbacks in most
Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
In exports, South Korea registered a drop of three percent in
May, 5.6 percent in June, and 13.9 percent in July this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports saw persistent decreases of 35.9 percent in
March, 37.6 percent in May, 36.6 percent in June and 43.7 percent
in July.
</P>
<P>
Alarmed by the plunges both in exports and imports, the
economic research institutes have readjusted or are redressing
their forecasts for the Korean economy in the latter half.
</P>
<P>
The Daewoo Economic Research Institute has made a downward
adjustment of its original forecasts for exports in the second
half from the original 71.1 billion U.S. dollars to 62.9 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Korea is expected to see both exports and imports decline
significantly in the second half because of serious credit crunch
stemming from financial and corporate restructuring, said the
Daewoo institute.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai Research Institute, which earlier predicted that
exports would reach 67.8 billion U.S. dollars for the second six
months of this year, changed the figure to 66.5 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
LG Economic Research Institute forecast that Korea will see a
trade surplus of 17.9 billion U.S. dollar in the latter half of
1998 with exports of 70.6 billion U.S. dollars against imports of
52.7 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
As the U.S. economy retracts by 1.4 percent in the second half
and the overall world economy is likely to continue suffering from
a slump, it would be very difficult for Korea to regain its
targeted exports in the latter half, said the LG institute.
</P>
<P>
Samsung is considering making a downward adjustment of the
exports and imports figures in the second half after taking into
consideration the weakening yen.
</P>
<P>
The Korea International Trade Association (KITA) predicted that
South Korea will register a trade surplus of 20 billion U.S.
dollars in the second half of this year with exports of 68.4
billion U.S. against imports of 48.4 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Iran Launches Extensive Efforts to Rescue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran is launching extensive
efforts to rescue 11 Iranian diplomats captured by the Afghan
Taliban militia in northern Afghanistan, a senior Iranian Foreign
Ministry official announced Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Tehran radio, Iran's special envoy on
Afghan affairs Alaeddin Boroujerdi said that Iran had contacted
the Pakistani government, the United Nations as well as the
Taliban militia soon after the diplomats were captured Saturday
after Taliban forces took over Mazari Sharif in northern
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Boroujerdi said that the Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan had met
with top Pakistani officials, urging Islamabad to help secure the
release of the Iranian diplomats.
</P>
<P>
In Tehran, the Foreign Ministry summoned Pakistani Ambassador
to Iran Javid Husain Saturday night to demand the Pakistani
government assume responsibility for the safety of the Iranian
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials have contacted with some officials of the
Taliban forces over the issue, Boroujerdi said.
</P>
<P>
He added that efforts had also been made to seek help from the
International Committee of Red Cross and the U.N. Secretary
General's special envoy on Afghan affairs.
</P>
<P>
The 11 Iranian diplomats were captured by the Taliban forces
Saturday after they conquered Mazari Sharif, the main stronghold
of the Northern Alliance headed by Afghan President Burhanuddin
Rabbani, who was ousted by the Taliban in September 1996.
</P>
<P>
Boroujerdi refuted the claim by some Taliban officials in media
interviews that there were no Iranian diplomats when the Taliban
forces took over the Iranian consulate in Mazari Sharif.
</P>
<P>
"Undoubtedly, this claim was a mere lie," the Iranian
special envoy said.
</P>
<P>
He accused the Taliban militia of breaching the international
laws by breaking into the Iranian consulate and detaining the
Iranian diplomats, who were later transferred to an unknown
place.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Condemns Bomb Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi, looking sad and shaken, toured the bomb rubble in downtown
Nairobi Sunday, mourning for thousands of victims and condemning
the cool-blooded bombers.
</P>
<P>
Latest official figure put the death toll at 155 with
another 4,824 injured in Friday's car bomb raid aimed to the U.S.
embassy located in a very busy commercial area in the Kenyan
capital.
</P>
<P>
The bombing was "astonishing and very terrible," said Moi,
adding that he does not believe the raid would help anyone's cause.
</P>
<P>
"How can they expect Kenyans to support their cause? How can
they expect us to support their cause if they use such methods?"
he asked in a sad mood.
</P>
<P>
"Even if they wanted the U.S. embassy, they should not have
targeted Kenya. Kenyans are peaceful people. Human lives are
precious, it is terrible to use methods that destroy human
beings, innocent human beings," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He urged the public to "be calm and help those in need."
</P>
<P>
"We are pursuing several clues," said Moi, withholding
details.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, the Kenyan government said in a statement
that it has taken measures to boost security in all diplomatic
areas, airports, ports and other entrances of the east African
country.
</P>
<P>
The government has also allocated 50 million Shillings (some
850,000 U.S. Dollars) as an emergency fund for the tragedy.

<HEADLINE> Airport Official: 70 Still Held Hostage on Board Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Terrorists held 79 people hostage
on board a passenger plane in the local Domodedovo airport, the
Interfax news agency quoted the airport's security chief as saying
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
This contradicted earlier reports that all 94 passengers aboard
the TU-154 plane have been released after negotiations between a
representative of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) and
the hijackers. They demanded 100,000 U.S. dollars in ransom and
sought to refuel the plane and fly to an unspecified foreign
country.
</P>
<P>
In a hand-written note, an unidentified man threatened to blow
up the plane if his demands were not met, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
The plane, which arrived from the Siberian city of Ust-Ilimsk,
was placed on the most remote section of the tarmac of the local
Domodedovo airport.
</P>
<P>
It was initially reported that only one man hijacked the plane,
but the FSB said later there might be two terrorists aboard.
</P>
<P>
The FSB's special Alfa commando, and units from the Interior
Ministry, the Air Force and the Ministry for Emergency Situations
were dispatched to the airport.
</P>
<P>
Interfax quoted airport management as saying that the
situation is under control and the airport continues to operate as
usual.

<HEADLINE> 10 Found Dead in US Embassy Bombing in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Ten have been confirmed
dead in the bombing of the United States embassy in Tanzania,
hospital sources said.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources at the Muhimbili Medical Center (MMC), where
most of the patients were admitted, told Xinhua on Sunday that
all of the dead were Tanzanians, including nine men and one
woman.
</P>
<P>
The sources said most of the dead were the embassy's security
guards, belonging to the Ultimate Security Group.
</P>
<P>
The hospital has reported 63 cases of casualties related to
the bombing, including the dead. Most of the injured admitted to
the hospital have been treated and discharged. Some patients have
been transferred to other hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar President Salmin Amour inspected the MMC on Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Other people injured in the incident have been sent to the
U.N. Dispensary, Mikocheni, Aga Khan and other hospitals, which
have not reported any deaths related to the bombing happened on
Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzania Red Cross Society information officer, Ubwa
Suleiman, said it is difficult to count the total number of
injured in the incident, because the hospitals did not deliver
any reports to the society. In addition, he said, some of the
wounded people went home after treatment.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye is expected to visit
the MMC later on Sunday.

<P>
MANILA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Sunday ordered the Department of Public Works and Highways
and local government units to intensify their flood control drive
in preparation for the rainy days.
</P>
<P>
According to a press statement issued by the presidential
office, Estrada said flood control measures such as declogging of
drainage canals must be completed soon in view of the threats of
severe flooding as a result of the so-called La Nina weather
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
Citing the severe floods that have hit China, Australia and
South Korea in the past few days, Estrada urged the full
cooperation of local government officials in the flood control
program.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> b d e 2494 China-Hong Kong-Peg Roundup: Determined Hong Kong Able to Defend Peg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong stands firm in its
determination and ability to maintain the linked exchange rate
between its currency and the U.S. dollar after witnessing a week
of continuous economic woes.
</P>
<P>
The volatile week started with a poor mid-year report of the
leading blue-chip Hongkong Bank Group, which announced on Monday a
41-percent slump in profits and an eight-fold rise in provisions
for bad debts.
</P>
<P>
The stock market plunged by about 900 points, or 11 percent on
a string of worse-than-expected interim reports by heavyweight
companies, including Hang Seng Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, Hong
Kong's flagship airline Cathay Pacific and the conglomerate Swire
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Speculators were reported to have made a comeback on Wednesday,
selling off Hong Kong dollars in an attempt to break the peg that
links the Hong Kong dollar to the greenback at 7.8 to one.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), Hong Kong's de facto
central bank, took quick action by buying in undisclosed amounts
of Hong Kong dollars in the currency market, thus aborting the
speculators' attempt. The move, said the authority, was to
purchase Hong Kong dollars for the government treasury which was
short of funds in this period of the year.
</P>
<P>
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said the Special
Administrative Region (SAR), backed by solid economic
fundamentals, ample reserves and strong support from the Central
People's Government, is capable of defeating speculators' attacks
on the Hong Kong dollar.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa meanwhile reaffirmed the SAR
government's determination to maintain the linked exchange rate
and China's central banker Dai Xianglong reiterated that Beijing
would not devalue the Renminbi.
</P>
<P>
Concerns over the crippling Japanese yen and rumors about a
Renminbi yuan devaluation resurfaced in the week and cast a shadow
over the economic recovery in the region.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, interbank interest rates rose amid the new wave
of speculative raids on the peg, but not as sharply as in the
previous rounds of currency attacks.
</P>
<P>
Financial Secretary Tsang expected the speculative attacks to
continue for as long as the Asian economic crisis remains. He
pointed out that the recovery of Hong Kong partly relies on the
improvement of the situation in the surrounding areas,
particularly in Japan.

<P>
The Interfax news agency reported that the hijackers demanded
100,000 U.S. dollars in ransom and sought to refuel the plane and

BEIDAIHE, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Since Japan is one of the major
developed countries in the world, China is willing to see Japanese
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's new cabinet make progress in
restoring its economy and mitigating economic difficulties in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin made the remarks today in a
meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the East Asian financial crisis, which occurred
last year, has affected both China and Japan. He noted that China,
proceeding from stablizing the regional economy, has kept stable
the Chinese currency and has consequently paid price.
</P>
<P>
Komura briefed Jiang on the measures the new Japanese cabinet
has taken to stablize the Japanese economy. He said that Japan
will work hard to restore its economic development, and it will
make contributions to easing the Asian economic difficulty.

Jiang said that China and Japan, as important countries in the
world, shoulder a major responsibility to maintain peace and
promote development.
</P>
<P>
In this way, the two sides should work together to bring a
peaceful, prosperous and stable world to the new century, Jiang
added.
</P>
<P>
"We are at an important historical point as the 21st century
approaches," said Jiang, noting that while looking back to the
20th century, the world is full of turmoils and changes, and that
the Sino-Japanese relationship has also undergone ups and downs.
</P>
<P>
He said that the invasion of China by the Japanese militarism
in the 1930s and 1940s had brought not only catastrophes to the
Chinese people, but also great sufferings to the Japanese people.
</P>
<P>
Jiang quoted an old Chinese proverb as saying that "history can
be served as a mirror, in which the rise and fall can be seen."
</P>
<P>
"The deepest enlightenment we have obtained is that as long as
we treat history in a right way, we can open up a better future,"
the Chinese president said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that it is imperative to summerize both the
positive and negative experiences of Sino-Japanese ties, and that
on this basis, the two countries will push forward the bilateral
relationship.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that this year is the 20th anniversary of the
signing of the Sino-Japanese Peace and Friendly Treaty, which has
defined all the principles set out in the Sino-Japan Joint
Statement and thus laid a solid political foundation for the
comprehensive development of bilateral relations and embodied the
common aspiration of both the Chinese and Japanese people to
enhance friendship for coming generations.
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to a state visit to Japan this fall," Jiang
said. "And I am willing to engage in a wide range of contacts with
all walks of life in Japan, including the government and the
public, to discuss and set forth the direction of development for
the bilateral relationship in the long run."

<HEADLINE> Foreign Media's Death Reports on Dyke Burst at Jiujiang Untrue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JIUJIANG, August 9 (Xinhua) -- "How come? No one was killed in
the burst so far," said Ma Yongwei, an army officer, ridiculing
reports by a certain foreign media that tens of thousands were
missing and many bodies seen in a burst on the embankment of
the Yangtze River at Jiujiang, in east China's Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
"It is a sheer lie," said an outraged Xinhua reporter who has
been boating around the dyke in the past two days to cover the
rescue operation and kept in touch with the Xinhua Head Office
via a mobile phone. "We are trying our best to make a full
coverage on what is happening here," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese media, including newspapers and televisions, have
been reporting on the wide-spread floods, the worst since 1954, in
the country in an unexpected frank way over the past weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Jiujiang burst is one of the latest incidents that have
been and will be closely monitored and covered by local media.
</P>
<P>
According to witnesses, a retiree, whose surname is Yu, is the
first to discover the beginning of the incident at around 13:10
on Friday, when water began to flow in through three water-sodden
bursting points on the dyke, each with a diameter of less than 30
cm.
</P>
<P>
The city flood control headquarters received the report about
the burst at 13:35 and experts were sent to detect the holes on
the inner side of the dyke.
</P>
<P>
Ma and his regiment rushed to the scene at 13:38, when the
size of the holes had grown to some 50 cm each.
</P>
<P>
"The people had enough time to flee, if they wanted," said
Ma. However, they were not scared away and fled. They began trying
to plug up the holes in an organized way.
</P>
<P>
The troops and local civilians made first attempts by throwing
100 cotton-stuffed quilts into the holes, but the effort failed
and the holes turned into a 6 m-wide major breach within two hours.
</P>
<P>
Then, the people dumped a truck at 16:30 trying to fill up the
breach, but it failed again. And, the breach went on to reach
35 m wide on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
In the following two days, an 80-m-long barge, loaded with
1,800 tons of coal, seven small boats and thousands of tons of
rock, paddy, soybeans and whatever at hand were put into the
breach. Heavy trucks have been shipping rocks to Jiujiang
from other parts of the province.
</P>
<P>
"It is very difficult to plug up the burst, due to the
torrential water and a lack of experience, technology and
materials," said the army officer, who has been combating the
burst over the past 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
A local expert told Xinhua that even if the 35 m-breach took
shape in a twinkle, it could not cause deaths. "This is because
the water level of the river stands merely two meters taller than
the ground and the water flow is some 100 cubic meters per
second. In the first hours, the water would be no more than an
ankle's height in the nearby area," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Upon receiving the burst report, the local government began to
ask residents living close to the dyke to move to safe areas
through radio broadcasts and loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
The burst has been attributed to the sustained high water level
in the river as rampant floods, the worst since 1954, has kept
surging in the Yangtze River Basin.
</P>
<P>
"There have been no reported casualties so far in the breach,"
confirmed Governor Shu Shengyou on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In latest developments, a team of army experts have been
summoned in from Hebei Province, north China, to help Jiujiang
plug up the breach.
</P>
<P>
The army experts have decided to hammer in dozens of steel
pipes in three rows on the basement of the breached dyke, while a
90 m-cofferdam has been built next to the breach to slow the flow
of the raging floodwater.
</P>
<P>
"The previous dumping of boats and other materials has slowed
down the water flow by one third and laid a good foundation for
our operation," said an army experts.
</P>
<P>
People have built a second cofferdam to prevent a four
sq. km. flooded urban area in the western part of the
city from further expanding. Currently, a third cofferdam, 3,000
m long, is being built to protect the eastern part of the city.
</P>
<P>
In the past two days, thousands of local residents have been
resettled and the city government has asked those living on floor
to move to higher floors.
</P>
<P>
So far, supplies of running water, electricity and daily
necessities as well as telecommunication services have been
adequate as usual in the city.
</P>
<P>
The city proper of Jiujiang, an industrial center and tourist
attraction in the middle reaches of the Yangtze with an
urban population of about 500,000, has an area of about 30 sq km.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Lifts Flour Imports Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Under the pressure from the World
bank, the Zambian government will lift on Sunday its embargo on
flour importation imposed two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Minister of Commerce, Trade and Industry, Enoch
Kavindele, said Saturday that the lifting of the ban, which he
described as "a painful decision", comes into effect from Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the speech in Ndola, 330 kilometers north of
Lusaka, to a large group of farmers drawn from all over Zambia.
He said that the Zambian government is in a difficult situation
since the move has been forced on it by the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the lifting of flour imports ban is another
condition made by the western donors.
</P>
<P>
"The government is in a difficult situation of whether to lift
the ban on finished flour imports from abroad and risk cash from
donors or to go ahead and be able to receive cash support from
the Paris Club, " said Kavindele.
</P>
<P>
To resist the lifting of the ban urged by western donors could
protect local wheat farmers but it will be catastrophic to both
individual businessmen and local manufacturing industries since
Zambia depends on donor cash flow, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He further explained that the World Bank has kept pressure on
Zambia since the ban was effected and now it said that apart from
the sale of the mines, Zambia should allow businessmen to bring
the commodity into Zambia.

MANILA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Some 17 million students of both
public and private schools in the Philippines will be vaccinated
for free against measles under a 10-year government program, the
education department said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a report to President Joseph Estrada, Education Secretary

children in the Philippines miss their measles vaccination in

HARARE, August 9 (Xinhua) -- President of the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) Laurent Kabila Saturday expressed
optimism that a four-member committee of southern African nations
will come up with a solution to the rising tension between his
country and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Mail newspaper, Kabila said relations
with the Kigali government were deteriorating and an urgent
solution had to be sought for a "serious crisis" in the Great
Lakes region to be avoided, Sunday Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
The four-member committee was constituted at the summit which
was held in Victoria Falls Town of Zimbabwe and attended by seven
leaders from southern African nations to seek a solution to the
DRC crisis.
</P>
<P>
President Kabila came to the summit with some demands, one of
them being the immediate withdrawal of Rwandan troops alleged to
have invaded DRC.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda has denied that it has troops fighting alongside rebels
in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
His other demand was for the meeting to issue a statement
condemning without reservation the invasion of the DRC by Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The seven leaders could not deliver such a statement given
that Rwandese President Pasteur Bizimungu denied the alleged
invasion. the committee will investigate the allegations.
</P>
<P>
"I hope they (the committee) will decide soon what to do with
our demands. The situation is really tense. There is an
aggression with Kigali. Relations are not good at all, but I am
sure we can ameliorate our relations," Kabila said.
</P>
<P>
He said his country has scheduled elections for next year and
a constitutional assembly is expected to be in place in the next
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
"Our people are with us and we have the capacity to mobilize
them to defend their sovereignty," he added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Brazil Cracks Down On Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Brazil is stepping up its
fight against rampant smuggling that has drained the state coffers
and posed a threat to the normal market operation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian government, in tightening control over the
seaports, international airports and land borders, has cracked
some 1,000 smuggling cases since late last year, seizing thousands
of tons of smuggled goods.
</P>
<P>
Smugglers, taking advantage of the country's 7,400
kilometer-long coastline and easy access to neighboring countries
across its lengthy border, have made Brazil a heaven for smuggling
in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics showed that in 1997, foreign goods worth 15
billion U.S. dollars were smuggled into Brazil, depriving the
country of 4 billion U.S. Dollars in tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
Smuggled computers, electrical home appliances, mobile
telephones, cigarettes, clothes, sports shoes, automobile tyres
and other exotic goods could easily be found in major cities like
Sao Paulo and Rio De Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
On the other side, Brazil's timber, gold, gems and wild animals
were taken out of the country by traffickers.
</P>
<P>
To curb the increasingly rampant smuggling, the tax and police
authorities cracked 700 smuggling cases and intercepted 4,500 tons
of smuggled goods in an operation in Santos, Brazil's import and
export hub.
</P>
<P>
At the international airports of Sao Paulo and Brasilia,
customs officers seized telecommunication products worth tens of
millions of U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In Sao Paulo, the authorities unearthed 45 warehouses where
hundreds of tons of smuggled goods such as electrical products,
information products and sports shoes were seized.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, tax authorities, police and security forces
took joint action in a southern city bordering Paraguay, and
seized 60 tons of smuggled goods.
</P>
<P>
The police intercepted about 40 tons of goods, including
electrical home appliances, cigarettes, foreign-made wine and
information products, after sudden inspections over the trucks on
the highways leading into Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian government is also enforcing discipline on the
country's tax and customs officers, punishing those breaking
regulations and taking bribes. For example, the state authorities
of Sao Paulo fired seven customs employees in one year last year.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the police formed a special unit in charge of
fighting international smuggling.
</P>
<P>
A high-ranking tax official said that tightening controls over
the customs and combating smuggling are to safeguard the country's
sovereignty and dignity, and Brazil will show no mercy to
smugglers.

<HEADLINE> County Destroys Dykes to Save Major City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Jianli County, in Hubei Province of
central China, destroyed some secondary dykes at 12:00 today to
divert floodwater to save Wuhan, capital of Hubei.
</P>
<P>
Jianli stands some 150 km upstream from Wuhan. Some 50,000
local residents living in the 180-sq.-km. diversion area have been
resettled.
</P>
<P>
The diversion area could hold 800 million cubic meters of
floodwater. The diversion in Jianli is expected to lower Yangtze
water levels by 10-25 cm on the Yangtze section between the Three
Gorges and Wuhan.
</P>
<P>
County leaders of Jianli offered to give up some of local
dykes on Saturday. But the diversion had not been materialized
immediately until today, because some local villagers were
reluctant to remove. It took local officials some time to persuade
them.
</P>
<P>
The central government has attached top priority to the lives
of the people and ordered that no diversion program could be carried
out without relocating all the affected residents.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government is still pondering on a major
diversion scheme to be carried out by blasting part of the main
dyke of the Yangtze in the Jingjiang Diversion Zone in Gong'an
County, 50 km upstream from Jianli. All the local residents that
would be affected by the proposed diversion have been resettled in
safe places.
</P>
<P>
The flood situation in Hubei has not gotten much better,
though the water level at Shashi has continued to fall, standing
at 44.70 at 12:00 today.
</P>
<P>
The major diversion program would be carried out in the
Jingjiang diversion zone, when the water level at Shashi reaches
45 m. and is still going up. It would mean that a part of
Yangtze's embankments in Gong'an would be dynamited and the North
Flood Gate would be opened to discharge floodwater.

<HEADLINE> Iran Summons Pakistani Envoy over Captured Iranian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The summon came after reports said that the Taliban forces
took over the Iranian consulate and captured its staff in Mazari
Sharif on Saturday following their conquer of the city, the main
stronghold of the Northern Alliance headed by the ousted President
Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Iran's special envoy on Afghan affairs Alaeddin Boroujerdi
told Husain that the Pakistani government and the Taliban
officials should be responsible for the safety and security of the
Iranian diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Iran calls on Islamabad to take serious measures to release
Iranian diplomats as soon as possible, Boroujerdi said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi
also called on the Pakistani government to help ensure the
safety of Iranian diplomats and their immediate release through
Islamabad's contacts with the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban regime formed in 1996 after defeating the
government troops is recognized and backed by Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi also condemned the continued bloodshed in Afghanistan
and killing of innocent people in northern parts of the war-torn
country.
</P>
<P>
Iran has announced time and again that military force is no
solution to the Afghan crisis and the region is in dire need of
calm and tranquillity, Mohammadi said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that due to considerable foreign interference, the
Afghan crisis has entered a new phase which brings about
further massacre of innocent people and rendering homeless
thousands of people of Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Pierce Beats Hingis in Toshiba Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Martina Hingis of
Switzerland was beaten in straight sets by Mary Pierce of France
in the semifinal of the 450,000 US dollars Toshiba Tennis Classic
in San Diego, the United States on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Second seed Lindsay Davenport of the United States advanced to
her second straight WTA Tour final by beating fourth seed
compatroit Monica Seles 6-4, 2-6, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, who was looking to reach her first singles final in
three months, lost to Pierce 7-6 (9-7), 6-2. It was a sweet
revenge for Pierce who was beaten by the world number one in last
year's Australian Open final.
</P>
<P>
Hingis lost in the semifinals at both the French Open and
Wimbledon. Two weeks ago, she posted two victories in her home
country, helping Switzerland advance to the Fed Cup final.
</P>
<P>
Davenport will face Pierce in the final on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
After an exchange of breaks in the third set, Davenport broke
Seles in the 11th game on a backhand crosscourt winner. Seles
saved one match point in the next game, but lost the next to give
Davenport her first victory in three tries against the former
top-ranked player.
</P>
<P>
Seles, a two-time finalist, has been troubled by back spasms
throughout the week. The 22-year-old Davenport, ranked second in
the world, won her second singles title of the year at last week's
Bank of the West Classic in Stanford, California. Her other title
came in February at the Pan Pacific Open in Tokey, where she beat
Hingis in the final.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka's Foreign Exchange Reserve Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's foreign exchange
reserve declined by 7.52 percent to 1.618 billion U.S. dollars by
the end of July from 1.74 billion dollars a month earlier despite
government effort to improve the position of foreign exchange
holdings.
</P>
<P>
The nation's foreign exchange reserve was short of the
appropriate level as recommended by the International Monetary
Fund, which calls on a country to retain foreign currencies
equivalent to three months' import bills, a Finance Ministry
official was quoted Sunday by the national New Nation daily as
saying.
</P>
<P>
For Bangladesh, a reserve of at least 1.95 billion dollars is
considered appropriate as the country's monthly imports usually
amount to 650 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The official predicated a continued depletion of the country's
foreign exchange reserve in the coming months because of growing
import demand and a fall in remittances by Bangladeshi wage
earners abroad.
</P>
<P>
The government's decision on Thursday to import 500,000 tons of
food grain, including 300,000 tons of rice and 200,000 tons of
wheat on an emergency basis to expand the country's stock, put
serious pressure on the foreign exchange reserve level.
</P>
<P>
A high official of the International Division of the Bangladesh
Bank, the country's central bank, attributed the depletion of
foreign exchange reserve to the huge payments for the import of
food grain, industrial raw materials, capital machinery and luxury
goods during the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Reduced export receipts were also responsible for the dip in
the reserve, he said.

currencies, which has created pressure on the krona.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Americans Protest Anti-Chinese Violence in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 1,000 people from the
Chinese community in metropolitan Washington areas rallied
Saturday at the Indonesian Embassy here to protest against the
anti-Chinese violence in Indonesia in May.
</P>
<P>
"Punish raptists!" "Punish murderers!" the protesters shouted
in front of the embassy. "We want justice, we want it now!"
</P>
<P>
During the riots caused by an economic crisis in May, 470 of
the 1,200 people who were killed were Chinese Indonesians, reports
said. At least 168 women and children of Chinese descent were
gang-raped in public.
</P>
<P>
"For the overseas Chinese all over the world, it is extremely
painful to learn about the crimes committed against Chinese
Indonesian women and children," said a protest letter signed by
hundreds of people.
</P>
<P>
The letter said that Indonesia's history shows a clear pattern
of violence against its Chinese minority.
</P>
<P>
"Whenever things got tough ... whenever there was social or
economic turmoil, the floodgate of violence would be opened up and
torrents of hate crimes driven by blatant racism would be directed
against Chinese Indonesians," noted the letter.
</P>
<P>
It demanded the Indonesian government "immediately stop the
on-going violence against the Chinese communities," "bring the
guilty to justice and conduct a thorough and unbiased
investigation."
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government should also apologize to the Chinese
communities and compensate families of the victims, the letter
said.
</P>
<P>
The protesters urged Indonesian authorities to enact new laws
to protect the rights of all minorities in Indonesia and to
prevent the recurrence of such horrible events.
</P>
<P>
The rally, one of a series of protests against the anti-Chinese
violence in Indonesia, was organized by the Indonesia Chinese
Human Rights Defense League, which was set up two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
"Our demonstration today illustrates that Chinese in America,
united, will not stand by in silence until Jakarta redresses these
wrongs and eliminates its apartheid toward the ethnic Chinese,"
said Samuel Mok, a leading member of the League.
</P>
<P>
He said that the tragedy should also serve as a lesson for the
Chinese people around the world.
</P>
<P>
"We Chinese Americans should not limit ourselves to our own
communities. Failure to engage in the mainstream political and
social activities in America can be costly," he said.
</P>
<P>
The rally was also joined by some Americans. Don Stallone, an
American who works with Chinese colleagues, said, "I think what is
happening to the Chinese population in Indonesia is pretty much
equivalent to what Hitler did to the German Jews ... It's
genocide."
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Chinese represent about 3 to 4 percent of Indonesia's
population of 200 million. They have few political rights and
their language and cultural tradition are forbidden in Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Ease Key Car Leasing Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 9 (Xinhua) -- People in Thailand may be able to
pay less money in a longer installment period when they lease cars
if the Finance Ministry convinces the central bank to soften the
key regulations for the industry.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Post Sunday quoted Deputy Finance Minister Pisit
Lee-artham as saying his ministry will ask the Bank of Thailand,
which governs the leasing industry in the country, to relax two
key regulations for car leasing.
</P>
<P>
The first regulation deals with minimum down payments on
leasing and auto hire-purchase. The ministry wants regulators to
reduce minimum down payment from 25 percent to 10 percent of the
purchase price.
</P>
<P>
The second change is to extend the maximum installment period
from 48 months to 60 months.
</P>
<P>
Both changes are hoped to spur demand in the hard-hit
automobile industry and increase consumer purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
Pisit said auto sales in the first half of this year had fallen
80 percent from the same period last year. Both the auto and
consumer electronics industries have been hard hit by the
recession, as public spending has fallen sharply because of the
economic uncertainty and decline in consumer confidence.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Rupert Murdoch's News Corp is
likely to be the model for emerging Chinese newspaper groups,
which are becoming increasingly market-oriented as competition in
the mass media hots up, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
China's first newspaper group, the Guangzhou Daily Group, was
founded in 1996. A further four groups -- the Nanfang Daily, the
Yangcheng Evening News, the Economic Daily and the Guangming
Daily -- were formed in May and June this year.
</P>
<P>
"Formation of newspaper groups will enable the mass media to
adapt better to the market-driven economy. Our goal is to expand
the influence of 'Party' newspaper, and enhance their financial
strength," said Xu Guangchun, deputy chief of the Publicity
Deparment of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China, at the opening ceremony for the Economic Daily and the
Guangming Daily groups.
</P>
<P>
The five newspaper groups have all been registered as companies
by the State Industry and Commerce Administration, meaning they
have independent rights to invest in or manage enterprises.
</P>
<P>
China now has 2,160 newspapers and 7,900 periodicals. The total
annual circulation of newspapers in China is estimated at 26
billion copies a year.
</P>
<P>
Information from the State Press and Publications
Administration said China will have eight to 10 newspaper groups
by 2000.

<HEADLINE> German Clubs Oppose European Super League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Most German soccer clubs are opposed
to the gossiped European Super League reportedly to be held in
2000, a leading club official said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Gerhard Mayer-Vorfelder, president of the Stuttgart club, said
the Super League will pose damages and crises to the national
leagues in Europe, and will result in conflicts between football
associations and investors.
</P>
<P>
"We have set up a committee of professional soccer within the
UEFA and the committee will hold its first session on August 25 to
tackle the issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the private investors are eager to sign contracts in
September with the clubs committed to compete in the Super League,
which will make two German clubs permanent members, namely Munich
and Dortmund.
</P>
<P>
Such a format with 16 permanent members and another 16 seats to
be vied throughout Europe, will enlarge the gap between those
competiting clubs and those outsiders in their respective national
leagues, the german soccer official said.
</P>
<P>
UEFA, the European soccer's governbing body, has reportedly
loosed its stance for a possible compromise settlement with major
European soccer clubs, which will see the eventual kick-off of the
Super League under the auspices of UEFA with large share of
incomes going to competiting clubs.

<HEADLINE> Jiujiang's Efforts to Plug Up Breach of Yangtze Dyke Slow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JIUJIANG, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Local people including soliders
are working strenuously in Jiujiang City, east China's Jiangxi
Province, to plug up a 60 m-breach on the city embankment of the
Yangtze River, but the effort has been slow due to technical
problems.
</P>
<P>
A section of the city dyke burst at 13:10 on Friday as rampant
floods, the worst since 1954, kept surging in the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
However, there had been no reported casualties so far in the
breach, according to Governor Shu Shengyou.
</P>
<P>
By now, people have sunk eight boats and dumped truckloads of
rock, paddy, soybeans and whatever at hand into the breach, in
case of a severe shortage of filling materials.
</P>
<P>
The effort has also been hampered due to a lack of experience
and equipment. A team of army experts have been summoned in from
Hebei Province, north China, to help Jiujiang plug up the
breach, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
The army experts have decided to hammer in dozens of steel pipes
in three rows into the breached dyke, while a 90 m-cofferdam has
been built next to the breach to slow the flow of the raging
floodwater.
</P>
<P>
The whole operation may take another 24 hours, according to
army experts. "The previous dumping of boats and other materials
has slowed down the water flow by one third and laid a good
foundation for our operation," said an expert.
</P>
<P>
People have built a second cofferdam to prevent a four
sq. km. flooded urban area in the western part of the
city from further expanding. Currently, a third coffer dam, 3,000
m long, is being built to protect the eastern part of the city.
</P>
<P>
Since the burst occurred, thousands of residents have been
resettled and the city government has asked those living on floor
to move to higher floors.
</P>
<P>
So far, supplies of running water, electricity and daily
necessities have been adequate as usual in the city.
</P>
<P>
The city proper of Jiujiang, an industrial center and tourist
attraction in the middle reaches of the Yangtze with an
urban population of about 500,000, has an area of about 30 sq km.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Disburses More Loans to Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yangon, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government disbursed a
total of 1.75 billion U.S. dollars in agricultural loans to
farmers in the 1997-98 fiscal year which ended in March,
increasing by 100 million dollars over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Of the total loans, most were used in cultivation of paddy, one
of the four major crops of Myanmar, amounting to 1.34 billion
dollars or 76.8 percent, according to the government's latest
annual report on agriculture.
</P>
<P>
In the fiscal year, the government also disbursed 146 million
dollars in advance payments to farmers who were in financial
difficulties to grow industrial crops such as jute, sugarcane and
tobacco. The move was to enable farmers to grow in time the
seasonal industrial crops which the government needs, thus
benefiting both the state and the farmers.
</P>
<P>
Increased disbursement of loans to farmers is one of the
Myanmar government's main measures for the promotion of
agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the proper measures taken, the country achieved a
growth of 2.9 percent in its gross domestic product in the 1997-98
fiscal year, producing 17.3 million tons of rice in the year.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has set an output target of 18.6 million tons of rice
for the current 1998-99 fiscal year beginning April, which is also
the third fiscal year of the present five-year plan (1996-97 to
2000-2001).

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Exports Up 10 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai exported 9.43 billion
U.S. dollars worth of goods in the first seven months of this
year, up 10 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In view of the mounting challenge posed by the Asian financial
crisis, the results are better than expected, according to Zhu
Xiaoming, director of the municipal committee for economic
cooperation and foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has set an export volume of 16.3 billion U.S. dollars
this year, an increase of 10.7 percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications equipment, electrical appliances, and
machinery all showed rapid growth, while exports of
labor-intensive products like garments, textiles, and iron and
steel were down.
</P>
<P>
Exports to the United States were up 26 percent, to the
European Union, 36 percent; and to Oceania, 19 percent. However,
exports to the Republic of Korea plunged 50 percent, followed by a

<HEADLINE> Swedish Currency Weakens in Wake of Asian Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The value of the Swedish
currency krona has fallen by more than 5 percent against the
German mark in the last three months, sparking belief that the
seemingly far-away Asian financial turmoil is affecting the Nordic
country.
</P>
<P>
With the Stockholm Stock Exchange's downturn this summer, some
analysts suspect that foreign investors, who have sold off large
holdings of Swedish equities, turned their profits into foreign
currencies, which has created pressure on the krona.
</P>
<P>
The latest weakening of the krona started after Swedish
telecommunication giant Ericsson's interim report was made public,
while pharmaceutical company Astra's report intensified the slide.
</P>
<P>
An economist of the Swedish Handelsbanken Markets said the
country's currency may also have been adversely affected by the
Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"When there is turbulence in Asia, some investors lump together
Sweden with commodity-sensitive economies like Canada and
Australia. They then sell off Swedish krona together with Canadian
and Australian dollars," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Has 11,695 km of Electrified Railways in Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The electrification of
Beijing-Zhengzhou section of the north-south Beijing-Guangzhou trunk
railway line was completed and put into operation Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
It brings China's mileage of electrified railway lines in
operation to 11,695 km, said today's "People's Daily".
</P>
<P>
The electrification of the 695-km Beijing-Zhengzhou Railway
started in 1992 and cost 3.49 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Advanced technologies and equipment were used in haulage power
transmission, contact network, telecommunications and signals for
electrification of the Beijing-Zhengzhou Railway, which was
undertaken by the Electrification Engineering Bureau under the
Ministry of Railways.
</P>
<P>
Facilities constructed during the electrification included
building of power transmission infrastructure, 16 haulage power
transmission stations, eight power stations, 500 km of power
transmission lines.
</P>
<P>
Before this, the 536 km section from Zhengzhou to Wuhan of the
2,300-km Beijing-Guangzhou Railway was electrified and put
into traffic in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Construction workers have now been busy electrifying the

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Basket of Crudes Price Drops Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan basket of crudes
and refined products closed the week with an average price of
10.15 dollars per barrel, which means a new drop of 26 dollar
cents, compared to last week's 10.41 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Energy and Mines Ministry figures show that the average
price of the Venezuelan oil basket was 11.23 dollars per barrel
during the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The average for the first seven months of this year is 11.10
dollars, which is 5.22 dollars lower than the average 16.32
dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The average price of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) seven crude basket was 12.01 dollars per barrel
at the close of this week, which means a drop of 49 cents from the
previous week.
</P>
<P>
All these show that oil prices keep a dropping trend despite
the efforts made to cut production since July 1 by the OPEC member
and non-member countries, which by now produce more than 3.125
million barrels a day.

WASHINGTON, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Second seed Lindsay Davenport
of the United States advanced to her second straight WTA Tour
final Saturday by beating fourth seed compatroit Monica Seles 6-4,
2-6, 7-5 at the 450,000 US dollars Toshiba tennis classic in San Diego of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Davenport will face the winner of tonight's match between top
seed Martina Hingis of Switzerland and unseeded Mary Pierce of
France on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
After an exchange of breaks in the third set, Davenport broke
Seles in the 11th game on a backhand crosscourt winner. Seles
saved one match point in the next game, but lost the next to give
Davenport her first victory in three tries against the former
top-ranked player.
</P>
<P>
Seles, a two-time finalist, has been troubled by back spasms
throughout the week.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Davenport, ranked second in the world, won her
second singles title of the year at last week's Bank of the West
Classic in Stanford, California. Her other title came in February

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Fall of Opposition Stronghold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 9 (Xinhua) -- In another formidable attempt
to take over the whole Afghanistan, the Taliban Saturday overran
Mazar-e-Sharif, the last stronghold of their rival northern
alliance, further dimming the hope of a negotiated settlement to
the Afghan conflict.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, the puritanical Taliban
stormed Mazar-e-Sharif, about 300 kilometers north of the Afghan
capital of Kabul, in an early morning attack and grabbed key
positions in the city Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But analysts here were quick to note that the fall of the
opposition stronghold does not mark the end to the protracted war
in Afghanistan. Instead, the upsurge in fighting may further
undermine the chance for a peaceful solution to the Afghan
imbroglio.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban's latest victory came a week after they took
Shiberghan, just 120 kilometers west of Mazar-e-Sharif and the
native stronghold of opposition warlord Rashid Dostum, who is
allied with former Afghan military chief Ahmad Masood and Shiite
Hezb-e-Wadhat.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time in the past year or more that the
turbaned militia have entered the headquarters of the northern
alliance, which has been dogged by frequent bouts of bitter
internecine fighting. The Sunni Taliban forces briefly controlled
Mazar-e-Sharif in May last year with the help of Abdul Malik,
Dostum's former right-hand man. When a deal over power-sharing
fell through, however, Malik staged an about-face and returned to
the opposition ranks, resulting in the militia's disastrous
retreat from the north.
</P>
<P>
With the fall of Mazar-e-Sharif, the Taliban, who now control
more than two-thirds of Afghanistan, have seriously impaired the
morale of the fragile opposition alliance and seem to be in a
better position to complete their four-year campaign to put the
whole country under their strict Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
However, it would be unrealistic to believe that the latest
victory of the hard-line Taliban would help herald some sort of
peace in Afghanistan as the fighting between the warring factions
always follows a see-saw pattern, analysts warned. They noted that
the main forces loyal to Tajik warlord Masood and the Shiite
Hezb-e-Wadhat are actually kept unhurt.
</P>
<P>
It is therefore safe to say at present that it is not the
northern alliance but the international community's peace efforts
that were hit hard by the Taliban's new round of aggressive
assaults as the crucial joint endeavor by Pakistan and Iran for
the restoration of peace in Afghanistan was immediately shelved.
</P>
<P>
Ayaz Wazir, who is in charge of Afghan affairs in the Pakistani
 Foreign Office, and Mohiuddin Najafi, former Iranian ambassador
to Afghanistan, were scheduled to visit Afghanistan for talks with
the leadership of the Taliban and northern alliance.
</P>
<P>
The trip, a follow-up to last month's visits by Pakistani envoy
on Afghanistan Ift Ikhar Murshid to the Taliban's southern
stronghold of Kandahar and by his Iranian counterpart Alaedin
Boroujerdi to the northern alliance's Mazar-e-Sharif, now seems
impossible to materialize.
</P>
<P>
The recent joint initiatives by Pakistan and Iran, both of
which exert strong influence on Afghanistan, were considered of
great significance as the two countries decided to join hands in
finding a solution to the Afghan conflict despite their
differences on Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Pak-Iranian peace initiatives took place at a time when the
Afghan peace process was actually stalemated after the last talks
between the Taliban and the northern alliance collapsed in early
May.
</P>
<P>
The week-long parleys sponsored by the United Nations and the
Organization of the Islamic Conference broke down here on May 3 as
the two sides failed to compromise on the formation of a proposed
Ulema (Islamic scholars) Commission which, if formed, would decide
the future political setup in the war-shattered country.
</P>
<P>
Now the situation has gone from bad to worse as the Afghan
warring factions have apparently abandoned the idea of peaceful
negotiations, leaving little room for maneuver for the
international peace brokers, analysts noted.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban's offensive in the north at this time may also
undermine the newly-established mutual trust between Pakistan and
Iran, which respectively recognize the regime of the Taliban and
the opposition alliance, they said.
</P>
<P>
"The Afghan crisis can be settled only by peaceful means,
through direct negotiations between the Afghan warring factions
under the United Nations auspices," the U.N. Security Council said
in statement on Friday, demanding "an urgent and unconditional
cease-fire leading to a final end to the hostilities."
</P>
<P>
It is self-evident that Afghanistan, a country composed of
multi-ethnic groups, cannot function smoothly under the complete
domination of one particular group even though it might be
militarily the strongest, analysts pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Given the deep division among the Afghan people on the
political, ethnic and tribal lines, lasting peace, which has
eluded the war-torn country for more than two decades, is not
likely to return soon even if all the provinces fall under the
sway of the Taliban militia in the immediate future, they added.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMSTERDAM, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Australian Richard Fromberg
toppled top-seed Slavak Karol Kucera on Saturday to reach the
final of the Grolsch Open ATP clay-court tennis tournament.
</P>
<P>
Fromberg rallied back from 3-1 down in the final set to beat
Kucera 6-1, 6-7 (7-4), 6-4, facing Sweden's Magnus Norman in the
500,000 US dollars final.
</P>
<P>
Norman won his final berth by defeating Argentinian Mariano
Zabaleta 7-5, 6-4 after receiving treatment at courtside because
of heat exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
Sixth-seeded Fromberg enjoyed his quick and comfortable win in
the first set, but Kucera, who ranked 14th, fought back in the
second by taking the tiebreaker 7-4.
</P>
<P>
In the third set, Fromberg first trailed 1-3 but eventually
recovered to win a crucial break point to even the score at 3-3.
</P>
<P>
From then on, Fromberg kept up the pressure to break Kucera
again and ran out a 6-4 winner.
</P>
<P>
In the Norman-Zabaleta match, the score was tied at 5-5 in the
first set and Norman squandered several chances to take the lead
before breaking for 6-5.
</P>
<P>
A lengthy game was stopped when Norman had problems triggered
by the heat, and a doctor came on court to measure his blood
pressure before his return to the court.
</P>
<P>
Norman served out to win the first set 7-5, and then finished
off the match with a 6-4 win in the second set.

YANGON, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar authorities has
deported a westerner, who holds dual British and Australian
citizenship, after he was released on Thursday in mitigation of
his punishment, the official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
James Mawdsley, who entered Myanmar illegally twice in 1997 and
April 1998 respectively and allegedly engaged in anti-government
acts, was sentenced by a Myanmar special court to five years'
imprisonment on May 15 under the country's Immigration Law.
</P>
<P>
James' father, who came over to Yangon on August 5, submitted
an appeal to the Myanmar head of State on behalf of his son and
later on August 6 James got released and deported after the rest
of his punishment was commuted, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Myanmar has been increasingly accusing the Western
bloc of threatening the country through its mass media, saying it
is trying to disturb stability, disrupt economy and unity and
incite unrest in countries which do not accept their influence.
</P>
<P>
The government also called on its people to beware of
subversive acts of foreign countries which interfere in Myanmar's
internal affairs.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Francesco Casagrande of Italy
savored the biggest victory of his six-year cycling career, by
winning the San Sebastian Classic on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old rider sprinted ahead from Belgium's Axel Merckx
and fellow Italian Leonardo Piepoli after the trio first broke
away 35 kilometers from home.
</P>
<P>
Along the seafront of the Basque city, Casagrande covered the
distance of 232 kilometers in five hours 43 minutes 45 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Merckx, riding for the Polti team, also enjoyed his best ever
result for a secon place finish with Saeco rider Piepoli third.
</P>
<P>
"It all went perfectly to plan. Normally I would have said that
Axel was the better sprinter but in the final kilometers he looked
tired and I knew I had my chance," said Casagrande.
</P>
<P>
The World Cup triumph is his third in the last week following
two victories in his native Italy.
</P>
<P>
Gan-Credit Agricole rider Cedric Vasseur led for much of the
early part of the race and at one stage had more than 11 minutes'
advantage over the main group.
</P>
<P>
A six-man group gradually caught him up by 160 kilometers but
Stephane Petilleau, Fabio Roscioli and Laurent Desbiens all made
short-lived attacks before reaching the final climb.
</P>
<P>
The final 32 kilometers split the field and allowed the leading
trio to escape.
</P>
<P>
Michele Bartoli of Italy finished in the main group but
retained his World Cup lead with six rounds gone.
</P>
<P>
Casagrande moved up 17 places after his victory and now lies
second in the rankings, with four races to go.
</P>
<P>
Tour de France winner Marco Pantani of Italy and second-placed
Jan Ullrich of Germany both made late decisions not to race.

<HEADLINE> China's Exports to Africa Soar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese exports to African
countries soared in the first half of this year and the momentum
is expected to be maintained for the next six months, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese Customs statistics, exports to Africa from
January to June hit 1.99 billion U.S. dollars, soaring 44.1
percent from the the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In the same period, China's total exports rose 7.6 percent
from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The impressive export growth mainly stemmed from China's market
diversification efforts, said Fu Zhengluo, a researcher with the
Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China's market diversification strategy was implemented in
1990. It aims to expand trade with Africa and Latin America, which
have been comparatively unexplored markets for Chinese traders.
</P>
<P>
The country's traditional export markets are the Asian,
European and North American countries.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to expand Chinese traders' share in the African and
Latin American markets have paid off, Fu said.

<HEADLINE> Power Grids to Be Upgraded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- China plans to invest around 100
billion yuan to upgrade its urban power grids over the next three
years, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Improving urban grids will expand power supply capacity and
enhance the quality of life of residents, said Wei Guangyao,
director of the Safety Operation Department under the State Power
Corp of China (SP).
</P>
<P>
The program is expected to play an active role in promoting the
domestic machinery and electronic industry, because almost all the
equipment needed in the upgrading project will be purchased from at
home.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it is destined to create huge demand for
air-conditioners, electric water heaters and other home
electrical appliances, Wei said.
</P>
<P>
The ambitious plan will also create numerous jobs, which are
vital in view of the growing number of laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
After careful research, the SP has produced a blueprint to upgrade
the power grids in 280 large and medium-sized cities by 2000. The
project gets under way in the first 62 cities this year.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that about 30 billion yuan will be put in the
project every year in the 1998-2000 period.

<P>
SHANGHAI, August 9 (Xinhua) -- While the provinces in the
middle reaches of the Yangtze are fighting a serious battle
against the worst flooding since 1954, the city of Shanghai, which
lies at the river's mouth, has increased spending on local flood
control facilities.
</P>
<P>
So far, 244 million yuan has been spent dredging river channels
and building or rebuilding embankments, flood gates and pumping
stations.
</P>
<P>
People from local flood control departments have been taking a
close look at all the major facilities in the city and some
anti-flood exercises have been carried out in the Pudong
New Area and on Chongming Island.
</P>
<P>
Though three flood crests have passed the city without
incident this summer, local officials worry that flooding, as well
as typhoons or tides, could still damage the city.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, calamities like these caused 524 breaches in local

<HEADLINE> Davenport Beats Seles for Toshiba Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Lindsay Davenport sent Monica
Seles to pack up her luggage after the semifinal of the Toshiba
Tennis Classic in Carlsbad, California on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Davenport used a late service break en route to winning the
final three games to eliminate Seles 6-4, 2-6, 7-5 in the
semifinals of the 450,000 US dollars Toshiba Tennis Classic.
</P>
<P>
The second-seeded Davenport was down 5-4 in the decisive third
set before she held serve and hit a cross-court backhand winner to
break Seles' serve and go ahead 6-5.
</P>
<P>
After Seles saved one match point, she hit a backhand wide to
end the 96-minute match.
</P>
<P>
Davenport was to face the winner of Saturday night's Martina
Hingis-Mary Pierce match in Sunday's championship match.
</P>
<P>
Davenport, a two-time titlist this year, will try to make it
two in a row after winning last week at the Bank of the West
Classic.
</P>
<P>
Seles, the No. 4 seed, called the loss "frustrating" because
she let an overturned line call in the third set affect her.
</P>
<P>
At 3-2, Seles appeared to get a break point when a shot by
Davenport was called out by the linesman. But chair umpire Anne
Lasserre-Ullrich of France overruled the call.
</P>
<P>
Seles protested and Davenport won the replayed point to
eventually level the score at 3-3.

<HEADLINE> Rice Planting Rushed In Flooded Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Hunan Province in central China
has planted over 1.3 million hectares of late rice so far in spite
of a serious flooding.
</P>
<P>
More than 600,000 hectares of farmland have been destroyed by
flood in Hunan since June. In the city of Changde, which was hit
heavily, people have been trying to make up for the losses by
speeding up the planting of late rice on 82,500 hectares, when the
flood waters began to recede a bit.
</P>
<P>
In Zhangjiajie city, farmers are on alert for possible plant
diseases caused by the flood.
</P>
<P>
Xiangxiang and Liling cities, two major rice producers that
were not affected, are making a greater effort to increase rice
output, using new planting methods.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, farmers in drought-stricken southern part of the
province have intensified efforts to improve the irrigation system
to get the rice in on time.

<HEADLINE> Export Grows in Southwest China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan Province
exported 530 million U.S. dollars worth of goods from January to
June, up 10.9 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The Southeast Asian financial crisis seems to have had little
adverse effect on Yunnan, which borders Viet Nam, Laos, and
Myanmar for more than 4,000 km.
</P>
<P>
Local officials attributed the export growth to the province's
multi-polar market strategy, which has led to a marked increase in
exports to North America and countries other than those in
Southeast Asia, and to the state's preferential policies, such as
a tariff rebate.
</P>
<P>
The province had 840 million U.S. dollars worth of foreign
trade in the first six months, a 3.3 percent increase over the
same period last year.

<HEADLINE> Russia Beats US to Face Yugoslavia in Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Russian cagers outwitted their
American peers 66-64 in a fierce semifinal, clinching their spot
in the final at the World Basketball Championship here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Russia thus will vie for the gold medal against Yugoslavia who
outscored the host Greece 78-73 in overtime in other semifinal.
</P>
<P>
Russia staged a late rally, coming back from 10 points down to
win the battle as Sergey Panov scored the winning layup with 4
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
American Wendell Alexis desperately threw in a 30-foot shot but
only after the final buzzer.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which went scoreless for the final 3:08,
will play Greece for third place Sunday. A loss would mean the
first worlds without a medal for the Americans in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Dejan Bodiroga had 31 points and Zeljko Rebraca added 20 points
and 13 rebounds for Yugoslavia, who overcame a 12-point deficit in
the second half.
</P>
<P>
The European champion, silver medalist at the 1996 Olympics, is aiming for a
record fourth title.
</P>
<P>
Backed by a capacity crowd of 18,000 at Olympic arena, Greece
opened up its biggest lead at 48-36 with 11:00 remaining.
</P>
<P>
But Yugoslavia clawed back thanks to some poor foul shooting by
Greece, which finished 11-for-22 from the line.
</P>
<P>
A layup by Aleksandar Djordjevic put Yugoslavia ahead 57-56
with 1:40 left in regulation. Greece's Nikos Economou who scored
team-high 25 points, hit one of two free throws 23 seconds later
to tie the game and send it to overtime.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia opened the extra period with a 9-2 run, capped by a
Bodiroga jumper, and held on for its 16th straight victory over
the Greeks, dating to 1987.
</P>
<P>
Russia's Sergey Babkov had a game-high 30 points in just 24
minutes, including back-to-back 3-pointers that tied the game,
64-64, with 1:23 remaining. Vassily Karassev added 10 points.
</P>
<P>
The loss to Russia means the United States will have to go
through qualifying for a spot in the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Only
the world champion and host Australia earn automatic berths.
</P>
<P>
In the games to determine fifth through eighth places, Italy
defeated Lithuania 76-71, while Spain beat Argentina 77-64.
</P>
<P>
Australia edged Brazil 79-75 to take ninth place and Puerto
Rico beat Canada 92-81 for 11th.

OTTAWA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Third-seeded Patrick Rafter of
Australia advanced to the final of the Du Maurier Open tennis by
defeating Briton Tim Henman 6-2, 6-4 in Toronto on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He will face either Andre Agassi of the United States or
Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands for the championship on Sunday
as the latters will play their semifinal later Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Rafter, the world's fifth-ranked player has advanced through
the tournament with straight-set wins over fellow Aussie
14th-seeded Mark Philippoussis, fifth-seeded Jonas Bjorkman of
Sweden and seventh-seeded Henman.
</P>
<P>
"He played a great match, he never let me get into it," Henman
said, "It's more him playing a very good match than me doing
anything wrong."
</P>
<P>
Rafter took just over an hour to beat Henman with near flawless
tennis. Henman had 23 unforced errors while Rafter finished with
12.
</P>
<P>
Rafter, 25, has steadily improved his game in the last two
years. He finished the 1996 season ranked 62nd, but a year later
jumped to the second spot in the world behind Pete Sampras after
winning the 1997 U.S. Open.

<P>
In other events, Wilson Kipketer opened his season with a

MOSCOW -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin Saturday resolutely
denied a draft law submitted by the State Duma, the lower house of
parliament, on transferring the president's powers to the prime
minister in case it needs.

According to the Interfax news agency, in his message to Duma
speaker Gennady Seleznyov, the president said that the draft law,
"on ensuring the continuity of presidential powers in cases when

<HEADLINE> Atkinson: Top Players Use Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Former manager Ron Atkinson has
claimed that the Premiership was full of players on cocaine and
cannabis.
</P>
<P>
"I know from my time at Villa that drugs are used by
footballers at the highest level," Atkinson says in his book e
ntitled "A Different Ball Game" serialised by the Mail on Sunday
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Atkinson, in charge at Villa in the early 1990s, said he
subjected the players to blood tests without telling them what
they were for.
</P>
<P>
"When the analysis was completed we discovered that at least
two of Villa's stars of that era had taken an illegal substance."
</P>
<P>
He alleged that drug-taking posed the biggest threat to English
football's future and the biggest drugs dealer in the game was
reputed to be a well-known England international, with a long
Premiership career behind him, who could get "what-ever substance"
players wanted. Premiership players are turning out "with
cocaine, certainly cannabis and all sorts of funy tablets buzzing
around their system".
</P>
<P>
Atkinson, one of the game's most respected figures, said he
first became aware of football's infiltration by drugs at the
start of the decade. And he blames the game's increasing shift
towards a pop star culture.
</P>
<P>
"The really big money was just starting to come into the game
and young lads, no age at all, were having money thrown at them,"
he said. "If they are treated like pop stars, sooner or later they
must start behaving like them."
</P>
<P>
His fears were backed by the FA's medical chief Alan Hodson,
who said: "It will ruin the game if we're not careful."
</P>
<P>
Atkinson added that football's response to its drugs crisis
must be to introduce fortnightly testing for every professional
footballer.
</P>
<P>
Atkinson, sacked last season as manager of Coventry, also said
that in his later management years he considered there to be
"probably a dozen players playing with some sort of illegal
substance in their bodies".

<HEADLINE> IOC Chief Calls to Reduce Drug List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 8 (Xinhua) -- International Olympic Committee
(IOC) president Juan Antonio Samaranch repeated his call on
Saturday to reduce the drug list.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the Catalan regional television station TV3 in
Spain, Samaranch said that he was looking to cut down the number
of banned substances because "it is not a list, it is a book."
</P>
<P>
Samaranch suggested eliminating various medicines which have
ingredients presently banned by the IOC and only retaining on the
proscribed list "those drugs which are really prejudicial to the
health of sports people and which produce artificial results."
</P>
<P>
The IOC president said he hoped that when the IOC executive
committee meets on August 20 it would be able make significant
steps towards convening an IOC-led conference on doping next
January.
</P>
<P>
"We have to define doping in only one way. We must have a
definition that is clear and exact," Samaranch said.
</P>
<P>
However the latest statements are believed to bring about
renewed criticism.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch was widely attacked for what was seen as a soft
stance on doping when he recently expressed similar views in the
Spanish newspaper El Mundo.

<HEADLINE> Round the World Balloon Trip Starts in Argentina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The aerostatic balloon
piloted by U.S. citizen Steve Fossett left last night from the
city of Mendoza, in the west of Argentina, with the aim of
navigating around the world.
</P>
<P>
As reported today by the local press, the trip will end 18 days
from now with the purpose of breaking all the records in this
matter.
</P>
<P>
Fossett, a U.S. businessman, plans to fly over the Atlantic
Ocean, South Africa, the Indian Ocean, Australia, and the Pacific
and return to South American territory.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. businessman said before leaving that the most
dangerous part of his trip is that he will have to fly over the
oceans of the south of the planet 80 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
The balloon Fossett is flying in is 45.5 meters high, 24.4
meters in diameter, and has inside 2.744 cubic meters of helium
and 2,832 cubic meters of air.
</P>
<P>
The cruising altitude will be 7,300 meters, with a temperature
between 30 and 50 degrees Celsius below zero and an average speed
of 80 kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
It was announced that Fossett, who invested 350,000 dollars in
this trip, will receive one million dollars if he completes the
round the world trip in the established time.
</P>
<P>
Fossett has promised that if he gets the million dollars
promised by a brewing firm, he will donate half of it to
Washington University in the city of Saint Louis, where Fossett is
a member of its trust fund board.
</P>
<P>
Fossett, a sportsman, has made several balloon trips. In 1994
he traveled from Canada to Germany, across the Atlantic, and in
1995 flew over the Pacific Ocean. He broke the world record in
1997 when he traveled 9,335 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The first trip in a balloon was made on August 8, 1706, exactly
292 years ago.
