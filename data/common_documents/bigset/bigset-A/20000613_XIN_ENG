<HEADLINE> Rusedski Back to Winning Ways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Greg Rusedski got back to his
winning ways with a convincing first round Stella Artois men's
tennis tournament victory over former champion Wayne Ferreira on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The British number two looked a lot more confident at Queen's
Club, back on his favored grass surface, and beat the tough
opponent 7-5, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Rusedski had started brightly but it was Ferreira who broke in
the first set.
</P>
<P>
Ferreira, a winner in 1992 and runner-up the following year,
broke in the seventh game to lead 4-3 and served for the set at 5-
4.
</P>
<P>
However he put a poor backhand into the net and a return winner
from Rusedski leveled the scores.
</P>
<P>
Rusedski, the ninth seed, then held serve before breaking
Ferreira again as his opponent missed a straightforward forehand,
slamming his racket into the turf in anger.
</P>
<P>
Rusedski then won his third game in a row to take the first set.
</P>
<P>
It was going with serve in the second set with Rusedski's big
serve coming more and more into play.
</P>
<P>
Serving at 4-5 down the South African saved one set point
before an excellent return from Rusedski to his opponent's feet
sealed the win 7-5, 6-4 in 67 minutes.
</P>
<P>
American Vince Spadea's miserable run continued. He let a one
set lead over compatriot Justin Gimelstob slip to lose his 20th
consecutive match by 2-6, 6-4, 6-1 to equal an Open era record.
</P>
<P>
The last player defeated in 20 successive matches was Canadian
Gary Donnelly during 1986-87.
</P>
<P>
Spadea has not won a match for nine months. His last victory
was in October 1999 in Lyon, France.

<HEADLINE> Portugal Surged Back to Beat England 3-2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Nuno Gomes' first international
goal on Monday gave his Portuguese team a 3-2 remarkable win over
England who had led 2-0 after 18 minutes of their Group A match in
the 2000 European Championship in Eindhoven of the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Goals from Paul Scholes and Steve McManaman lifted England to a
2-0 lead but a stunning 30 meter drive by Luis Figo and a flying
header by Joao Pinto made it 2-2 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
Nuno Gomes then latched onto a perfect Rui Costa pass in the
59th minute to complete Portugal's superb fightback. The win put
Portugal on top of the group after the earlier 1-1 draw between
Germany and Romania.
</P>
<P>
"We have been working for this for two years." said Portuguese
coach Humberto Coelho after the thrilling comeback.
</P>
<P>
"I'm satisfied because we managed to turn things around. This
is a team that is mentally and physically fit and is prepared to
win each game." Coelho added.
</P>
<P>
England holded a 2-0 lead in the 18th minute when Beckham
clipped in another cross from the right and McManaman expertly
shot home on the half-volley.
</P>
<P>
Luis Figo reduced the deficit six minutes later with a
thunderous shot from 25 meters that flew through the legs of
defender Tony Adams.
</P>
<P>
Rui Costa was running unmolested through the England midfield
and another fine cross from the right gave Joao Pinto the chance
to fling himself in front of Sol Campbell and connect with a
flying header to make it 2-2 in the 37th minute.

<P>
BRUSSELS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Title holders Germany were
shocked by an early goal but still rallied for a 1-1 draw with
Romania in their opening match of Group A at the 2000 European
Championship in liege of Belgium on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Romania surged to a 1-0 lead less than five minutes into the
action when the German defence were caught napping by Adrian Ilie
who broke down the left and squared across the face of the goal
for Viorel Moldovan to score.
</P>
<P>
The Romanians dominated the early stages but the current
champions finally broke their grip when Mehmet Scholl scored with
a superb, curling left foot drive from the edge of the box in the
28th minute.
</P>
<P>
The match, in which Thomas Haessler earned his 100th cap for
Germany and Lothar Matthaeus extended his world record to 148
appearances, faded in the second half though both teams wasted
good scoring chances, notably Moldovan who blasted wide before an
open goal in the 68th minute.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader Advocates Multipolar World, Raps NATO for Airstrikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 12 (Xinhua) -- China's top lawmaker Li Peng, in
an address to Yugoslavia's Federal Assembly on Monday, advocated
the establishment of a multipolar world and lashed out at the U.S.-
led NATO for the 87-day airstrikes against Yugoslavia last year.
</P>
<P>
In the address, Li, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress of China, said that today's world is in
a transition toward a structure of multipolarity.
</P>
<P>
"We advocate multipolarity, because multipolarity is better
than unipolarity, and multipolarity can embody the common
aspiration and interests of a majority of the nations and peoples
in the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, multipolarity also conforms to the intrinsic law of
the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that as international affairs are very complicated, it
is both harmful and impossible for only one country or a few
countries to dominate the world.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, the eventual formation of a structure of
multipolarity will be a long historical course, all countries in
the world should, through equal exchanges and dialogues among them,
enhance mutual understanding, diminish differences, expand
consensus, and seek for ways of peaceful co-existence, of seeking
common points while reserving differences and of mutually
beneficial development," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a megatrend of civilization and progress of the world,
" he stressed.
</P>
<P>
On the U.S.-led NATO's 87-day airstrikes against Yugoslavia
last year, the Chinese leader said, "On the eve of mankind's entry
into the 21st century, the U.S.-led NATO brazenly launched
airstrikes against the sovereignty country of Yugoslavia, staging
a gross violation of the internal affairs of Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
This act was in violation of the purpose of the United Nations
Charter and universally recognized norms governing international
relations, and seriously affected European stability and world
peace, he charged.
</P>
<P>
Regrettably, although that war is over, the issue of Kosovo has
not yet been solved, ethnic contradictions have not been eased,
the issue of refugees remains striking, and peace and stability in
the Balkans are far from realization, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"This is enough to indicate that bombs can never make peace,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
In that war, the United States used missiles to attack the
Chinese embassy in Belgrade, causing heavy casualties of personnel
and serious damage or destruction to the embassy buildings, Li
recalled.
</P>
<P>
"That was a rare and serious international illegal act in the
history of diplomacy of the world, which grossly violated the
sovereignty of China and greatly hurt the feelings of the Chinese
people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed gratitude to Yugoslavia for its assistance after
the embassy attack.
</P>
<P>
Li also reaffirmed that China always sticks to its independent
foreign policy of peace, upholds principles and justice in
handling international affairs, and is always a firm force for
safeguarding world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Also Monday, Li met here with Srdja Bozovic, Chairman of the
Chamber of Republics of the Federal Assembly, and Milomir Minic,
Chairman of Citizens of the Federal Assembly, to discuss bilateral
relations and exchange views on further strengthening the exchange
and cooperation between the National People's Congress of China
and the Federal Assembly of Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> GCC Chief Applauds Saudi-Yemeni Border Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) Jameel Al-Hujailan on Tuesday welcomed
the just-signed Saudi-Yemeni border agreement which laid down
arrangements to solve the chronic border dispute between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, where the
GCC headquarters are based, Hujailan described as "a historic
event" the signing of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
He said this achievement reflected the faithful political will
of the two countries to solve the most complicated problems between
them.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and Yemen signed the border accord in the western
Saudi city of Jeddah on Monday during a two-day visit to Saudi
Arabia by Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh.
</P>
<P>
The joint communique issued at the end of Saleh's visit said the
agreement outlined border coordinations between the two countries
for territory covered by the 1934 Taif Agreement and annexes, which
granted three provinces in the border areas to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yemeni officials accompanying Saleh said the pact
laid down arrangements for the demarcation of 1,500 kilometers
inland and maritime borders.
</P>
<P>
Riyadh and Sanaa have been locked in border deputes since the
1930s and witnessed occasional border clashes of their security
forces. They have to re-locate about 300 border signs which had
disappeared due to denudation and aging factors.
</P>
<P>
The two Arab neighbors also need to negotiate a solution to
their maritime border dispute in the Red Sea, where their border
guards exchanged fires in July, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni president said the joint committees headed by the
interior ministers of both countries will supervise the
implementation of the border pact and a company will be selected to
demarcate the borders.
</P>
<P>
"The forces of the two countries will withdraw about 20
kilometers on both sides," Saleh added.

<HEADLINE> Russian Envoy Visits Cyprus in View of Upcoming Talks on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian Special Representative for
Cyprus Vladimir Prygin here Tuesday expressed the hope for progress
in the upcoming third round of Cyprus peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Prygin arrived here Monday for a three-day visit in view of the
third round of U.N.-sponsored indirect talks on Cyprus, scheduled
to begin on July 5 in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Prygin had separate meetings Tuesday with Cyprus President
Glafcos Clerides and President of the House of Representatives
(parliament) Spyros Kyprianou.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the meetings, Prygin stressed his
country's steady and continuous support for efforts toward a Cyprus
settlement in accordance with international law.
</P>
<P>
He said negotiation is the only way to reach a viable and
lasting solution to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the next round of talks will be constructive and some
progress and steps forward will at last be achieved," Prygin said,
adding, however, that "negotiations cannot go on for ever, their
purpose is to produce results."
</P>
<P>
According to Cyprus News Agency, Prygin will meet with Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash in the Turkish Cypriot-populated
northern area of the island on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Prygin is also expected to be in Geneva at least for the first
few days of the third round of indirect talks.
</P>
<P>
This is Prygin's first visit to the island since his appointment
last month. He had served in Cyprus in the past at the embassy of
the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island after a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the two sides have had two rounds of indirect, or "
proximity," talks sponsored by the United Nations, the first round
in December 1999 in New York and the second in February 2000 in
Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The proximity talks were aimed at preparing the ground for
substantive negotiations leading to a comprehensive settlement.

<HEADLINE> OPEC To Study in Vienna Increase Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) said Tuesday it'll decide at its
forthcoming June 21 meeting in Vienna if it'll increase the offer
for a price reduction.
</P>
<P>
OPEC hasn't "favored or opposed production increase," the bloc'
s president, Venezuelan Energy and Mines Minister Ali Rodriguez,
told the press.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez attributed the price increase to internal "joint
situations" in the United States having repercussion on
international prices, like the entry into force of environmental
measures in the country.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said that the Vienna meeting will be preceded by
other encounters in face of the market's nervousness, as crude
will reach this Monday in New York 31.74 dollars a barrel, the
highest price in the last three months.
</P>
<P>
At this time of the year there's always a fall in demand with
its subsequent rebound upon prices, he added.
</P>
<P>
OPEC cannot rush into decisions it takes on June 21 facing the
market's situation, Rodriguerz added.
</P>
<P>
Caracas will be the seat of the 2nd OPEC Summit in September.
</P>
<P>
OPEC decided last March in Vienna on a system to reduce the
offer if in 29 continuous days international prices go down to 22
dollars and will put it up if they're over 28 dollars.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges Security Council to Demand Peace in DRC EDS-Updated with more quotes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Tuesday asked the Security Council to demand a halt to
fighting between Ugandan and Rwandan troops in Kisangani, a
diamond trade center in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC),
and their prompt withdrawal from the central African country.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief also called on the 15-nation body to demand the
early withdrawal of all other foreign forces from the country, the
former Zaire, as foreseen in an accord signed in Lusaka, capital
of Zambia, which is intended to end the many-sided conflict in the
country.
</P>
<P>
In both cases, Annan said, the Council should act under the
mandatory provisions of Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter, which
provides for possible sanctions or other punitive measures in the
event of noncompliance.
</P>
<P>
Annan also urged the Council to invoke Chapter VII of the U.N.
Charter "to demand the subsequent early withdrawal of all other
foreign forces" in the DRC, as foreseen in the Lusaka accord.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council Tuesday, Annan said the
situation in the DRC and prospects for further progress in the
peace process "have become particular uncertain."
</P>
<P>
Referring to fighting between Rwandan and Ugandan troops last
week in Kisangani, Annan said, "I invite the Security Council,
acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, to
demand that the governments of Rwanda and Uganda order their
respective armed forces to desist forthwith from further fighting
and withdraw from Kisangani immediately and from the territory of
the Democratic Republic of the Congo promptly thereafter."
</P>
<P>
The two forces "should be held accountable for the loss of
life and the property damage" they had inflicted on the civilian
population of Kisangani, he said. The report said an estimated 150
civilians had been killed and more than 1,000 wounded, despite
repeated efforts by Annan and others to secure a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the continued fighting, Annan cited the
government's decision not to take part in preparatory meeting for
an inter-Congolese dialogue, its attempts to block participation
of the unarmed opposition, and "the chronic shortage and delays"
in providing resources for the facilitator of the national
dialogue appointed by the Organization of African Unity (OAU),
former Botswana President Ketumile Masire.
</P>
<P>
"These difficulties have been compounded by the government's
announcement, on June 9, of its withdrawal of confidence in Mr.
Masire," and its request to the OAU to nominate a new neutral
facilitator, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Organization mission in the DRC (MONUC), in its
current phase, comprises only about 228 military observers and
military liaison officers in and around the DRC, including 200 in
that country itself.
</P>
<P>
The fighting in the DRC pits the government of President
Laurent Kabila, backed by Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, against
rebel groups supported by Rwanda and Uganda.

<HEADLINE> UK Inflation Rises Higher In May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Britain's inflation rate rose to 3.
1 percent, compared to 3.0 percent in April, which was slightly
higher than expected, and the highest since September 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics said the main reason for the
rises in the headline rate was the increased cost of mortgages,
while the price of household goods continued to fall.
</P>
<P>
Other areas where prices are rising, putting pressure on
inflation, include motoring costs, leisure spending ,and personal
services, according to the figures released by the ONS.
</P>
<P>
The figures also show that the prices of goods leaving the
factory gates rose by just 0.1 percent in May, despite a 3.6
percent in input costs, the highest monthly rise since the series
began in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
"The recent rebound in the oil price was the culprit behind
today's surge in input price inflation," said James Carrick of ANG-
AMRO.
</P>
<P>
"However, even if the oil price remains at its current levels,
producer input price inflation should ease as last year's sharp
monthly increase in the oil price drop out of the comparison," he
added.

<HEADLINE> EU Probing Credit Card Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Union said Tuesday
that it was probing the credit card industry practices including
fee payments between banks and card handlers.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
bloc, said that the commission is looking into various aspects
concerning Visa and credit cards in general.
</P>
<P>
"One of the questions the commission is looking into is the
fees that the banks must pay each other for carrying those credit
card payments and there we expect a decision before the end of the
year," said commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres.
</P>
<P>
The probe also includes the relationship between the card
companies and retailers, the spokeswoman added.
</P>
<P>
Torres said that the rule that bank members of Visa and
MasterCard could not issue competing cards did not exist in Europe.
"We actually prohibited the attempt by Visa to impose a similar
rule in Europe."
</P>
<P>
The commission warned Visa back in 1996 against exporting the
rule to the EU after American Express filed a complaint.
</P>
<P>
A United States Justice Department lawyer told a New York
federal court Monday that Visa and Mastercard, that combine to
control 75 percent of the U.S. credit card sales, do not truly
compete with each other. They also thwart rivals by barring them
from working with their member banks, the lawyer added.

UNITED NATIONS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable rights of the

policies designed to promote the living conditions of the
Palestinian people, as well as economic cooperation and
development.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the current state of
the Palestinian economy, the factors that affect it and its future
prospect, DPI said.
</P>
<P>
It is also aimed to mobilize greater support from governments,
intergovernmental and civil society organizations for the
attainment of the legitimate economic rights of the Palestinian
people, thus, contributing to the broader peace-building efforts,
DPI added.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela's President Puts Doubt on Crude Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, June 13 (Xinhua)-- Venezuela's President, Hugo Chavez,
cast doubt Tuesday whether present oil price is high.
</P>
<P>
A 30 dollar barrel of crude nowadays is equivalent to about 15
dollars 20 years ago, said Chavez at his inaugurating talk in
international seminar "New World Tendencies and the Future of
Petroleum and Energy", that will end Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The leader asked if it's true oil is priced at very high or if
that's how "they want to make producers seem and generate guilty
feelings upon us".
</P>
<P>
Crude reached this Monday in New York 31.74 dollars a barrel,
its highest price in the last three months. Analysts attributed
the price rise to the speculation that any Organization of
Petroleum exporting countries (OPEC) output increase will be
delayed until the end of this month at the end of the earliest,
leaving U.S. inventories low.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela is the largest oil exporter in the Western
Hemisphere and Caracas will be in September the next seat of OPEC'

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan parliament on Tuesday
started debating the petition which seeks an explanation from the
government on the repeated clashes between Ugandan and Rwandan
troops in Kisangani, a northeast city of the Democratic Republic
of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The mover of the petition Winnie Byanyima, a member of
parliament (MP), blamed the government for deploying troops in the
DRC without mandate from the parliament, Radio Uganda reported
Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Most MPs expressed disappointment over the clashes between the
two former allies, which had claimed many lives, the Radio said.
</P>
<P>
In the latest clash, at least 150 Congolese civilians were
killed and another 1,000 injured during a six-day shelling by
Ugandan and Rwandan forces which erupted on June 5 as they both
began to withdraw from Kisangani under an agreement to
demilitarize the city.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda have sent troops to support rival rebel
groups fighting against DRC President Laurent Kabila since the
conflict began in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
The parliament is expected to pass resolutions to be presented
to the government for consideration at the end of the debate, the
report said.

</P>
<P>
The ultra-orthodox Shas, which holds 17 seats in the 120-member
Knesset (parliament), announced Tuesday that it would quit the
coalition government of Barak because Barak failed to allocate
millions of dollars of additional funds for the party's religious
educational network.
</P>
<P>
The pulling-out of Shas will make the Barak administration,
currently having a 68-52 majority in the Knesset, shrink to a 51-
seat minority.
</P>
<P>
Barak is convening ministers of his One Israel bloc to discuss
the latest development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Israel's Channel Two television, Itzik, however,
said the establishment of a national unity government with the 19-
seat Likud, the second biggest party in the Knesset only after One
Israel, is "a real possibility".
</P>
<P>
Responding to Likud Chairman Ariel Sharon's remarks that he will
never bring the Likud into a government led by Barak, Itzik, one of
Barak's closet aides, asserted bluntly: "Don't believe what you
hear from Sharon."
</P>
<P>
She confirmed that Sharon was maintaining contacts with the
ruling One Israel bloc "one way or another".
</P>
<P>
The minister added that Sharon is an experienced politician and
is aware of the polls, which is the reason why he would prefer
national unity to early elections.
</P>
<P>
A Gallup poll published on Tuesday showed that the majority of
Israelis (57.6 percent) prefer a national unity government with
Likud over a coalition with the religious parties.
</P>
<P>
Another reason is Sharon's age, Itzik stated. "For personal
reasons and his understanding of the political situation, Sharon
prefers to enter a national unity arrangement," she said.
</P>
<P>
Sharon, 72, was elected party chairman last year with a promise
to hold party primaries before the next election. It is widely
believed that in such primaries, Sharon will be easily defeated by
former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu or other younger leaders.
</P>
<P>
The environment minister was obviously launching a counter-
threat to the Shas party, saying that the government has been too
patient with Shas.
</P>
<P>
Itzik said the government had not received the last word from
Shas about the resignation, a sign that there is still room for
maneuvering a coalition agreement to prevent the breakup.
</P>
<P>
The resignation was announced by Shas leader Eli Yishai in a
televised interview Tuesday afternoon after an urgent meeting of
Shas' policy-making Council of Torah Sages.
</P>
<P>
Shas' ministers and deputy ministers will submit their
resignation letters in the forthcoming cabinet meeting, according
to Rafael Pinhasi, secretary of the panel.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet is scheduled to convene on Sunday, but there are
reports that the resignation will take effect in 48 hours. It is
not clear whether the party will back down at the last minute as it
had done several times before.
</P>
<P>
Tommy Lapid, leader of the secular Shinui Party, had suggested
that Shas' announcement of resignation was merely a political trick
to raise the price it will cost Barak to keep Shas on board.
</P>
<P>
There are no immediate reactions from Yisrael Ba'aliya and
National Religious Party (NRP), Shas' two right-wing fellows in the
coalition.
</P>
<P>
If they follow Shas' steps to quit the coalition, Barak's
control in the Knesset will be further reduced to 42 seats, which
means the de facto death of Barak's 11-month-old coalition.
</P>
<P>
The crisis will surely hamper Barak's efforts for reaching peace
deals with the Palestinians and Syrians, as such agreements must be
approved by parliament.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators, which
resumed Tuesday in the United States, are intended to reach a
framework agreement and a final accord by September on final-status
issues, such as the fate of Jerusalem, the return of Palestinian
refugees, Jewish settlements, border, security and water.
</P>
<P>
Israel also hopes to reopen the talks with Syria, which broke
off early January due to Syria's insistence that Israel pledge to
the return of the Golan Heights it seized from Syria in the 1967
Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
All the three parties, which Barak included in his coalition
last July to broaden the support base for peace talks with Arab
countries, voted along the oppositions last Wednesday in a
preliminary reading in favor of a bill calling for early elections.
</P>
<P>
The major contention point between Shas and Barak is Shas'
demands for millions of additional dollars to save its corrupt and
almost-bankrupt educational network, which is believed by many
analysts as the real drive behind the party's rebellious acts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yisrael Ba'aliya and NRP are against making
concessions to the Palestinians in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
If Barak failed to induce Likud into a national unity coalition,
he will be left with the option to form a narrow minority
government with the six-seat secular Shinui party, the two-seat
Democratic List and the two-seat Am Ehad (One Nation).
</P>
<P>
Such a government will be a 52-seat minority, whose survival
depends on the support from 10 Knesset members of Israeli Arab
parties outside the coalition.
</P>
<P>
It would place Barak in a more precarious situation regarding
land handover to the Palestinians, which will be resting on a
majority of Arab and non-Jewish parties.
</P>
<P>
Barak could also call for early elections in a hope to resolve
the government weakness once and for all. However, local analysts
believe that Barak dislikes the idea, as it will bring too many
uncertainties.

NICOSIA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and Israel have agreed on
technical matters relating to flights by Israeli war planes over
Nicosia and its surrounding areas, government spokesman Michalis
Papapetrou announced here Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Secretariat Asked to Be "Careful" on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides Tuesday criticized the United Nations for its "clumsy"
handling of the addendum to the resolution for renewal of the U.N.
Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP).
</P>
<P>
Speaking before leaving for Luxembourg, Kasoulides warned the U.
N. Secretariat to be "very careful" in its treatment of the Cyprus
issue, Cyprus News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Monday night, the U.N. Security Council postponed a planned
meeting to approve a routine renewal of the UNFICYP mandate, which
will end on June 15.
</P>
<P>
At issue is whether the wording of the addendum suggests that
only the concurrence of the Cyprus government is necessary for
UNFICYP's renewal or whether the consent of the Turkish Cypriot
regime is also required.
</P>
<P>
"Our position will be not to give our consent for the renewal of
UNFICYP if we are not satisfied with the wording of the addendum,"
Kasoulides said.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides explained that the reason for the Cyprus government
to attach great importance to the resolution is that last time the
positions of the Turkish Cypriot side were noted down, in complete
ignorance of the Greek Cypriot side.
</P>
<P>
The addendum in December, in addition to saying the Cyprus
government had concurred in UNFICYP's renewal, spelled out the view
of the Turkish Cypriots that "UNFICYP can operate on both sides of
the island only on the basis of the consent of both parties" and
that the Turkish Cypriot authorities will accordingly request
UNFICYP to work with them to develop modalities for the force's
operation in the north.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides criticized the way in which the U.N. Secretariat
handled the addendum in December because it opened "Pandora's box"
for all these discussions to take place.
</P>
<P>
"It proves that those handlings were clumsy" and the government
is making efforts not to allow the other side to have a political
advantage beyond what is prescribed by U.N. resolutions, he added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when Turkey
invaded and occupied the northern third of the island following a
short-lived coup, engineered by the then Greek Junta.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the UNFICYP troops have been patrolling along the
dividing line separating the Turkish troops and the Greek Cypriot
national guards.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said Tuesday that the European Central Bank is delivering "low
inflation and higher growth across Europe."
</P>
<P>
In an article in the Financial Times written with his Spanish
counterpart, Jose Maria Aznar, Blair called for further economic
reform to build on the "success" of the single currency's launch.
</P>
<P>
Blair and Aznar said: "This is clearly in the interests of
those countries already in the euro. But it is also in Britain's
interests."
</P>
<P>
Blair has promised that he favors joining after the next
general election subject to the right economic conditions and
public approval in a referendum.
</P>
<P>
"The EU is Britain's largest trading partner by a considerable
margin. British exporters, inward investors, and the people they
employ all know how damaging exchange rate instability can be,"
the two leaders said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the article, observers said it reflects Blair's
view that economic reform in Europe will strengthen the single
currency and, subject to convergence between the British and
continental economies, make it easier for sterling to join.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders give a clear signal they do not want to see the
drive towards economic liberalization watered down, either at the
Feira summit or during the French presidency that begins next
month, they added.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Government Wants to Sell Majority Shares in Telecom Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss federal government has
expressed the hope that it will be able to sell its majority stake
in the telecom group, Swisscom, according to Swiss Radio
International Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, Swiss law currently does not allow the government to
reduce its stake below 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government also said that it wants to create a Postbank as
a means for the postal service to finance mail and deliveries.
</P>
<P>
The federal ministry for the environment, traffic and
telecommunications said in a statement that the cabinet would
submit legislation before the autumn on Swisscom and the postal
service.
</P>
<P>
"The government should be allowed to sell its majority stake in
Swisscom, even though it could be necessary to create control
mechanisms for a minority stake for a determined period," the
ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The government currently controls 65.5 percent of Swisscom and
the company has been lobbying for a possible further privatization,
allowing it to strike alliances when needed.
</P>
<P>
The ministry added that the postal services "should be able to
finance its basic services by the creation of a Postbank, which
would operate under the same market conditions as other banking
institutions."
</P>
<P>
Under the changes, the sale of shares in Swisscom would allow
for the recapitalization of the postal service and the creation of
a Postbank.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the planned creation of a Postbank would
require 1 billion Swiss francs (about 0.61 billion U.S. dollars),
with a further 5 billion Swiss francs (about 3 billion dollars)
needed for the recapitalization of the postal services' pension
funds.

<HEADLINE> WHO Issues Principles to Protect Human Health from Antimicrobial Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
has released global principles aimed at mitigating the risks
related to the use of antimicrobials in food animals.
</P>
<P>
The new recommendations, agreed upon at a WHO experts' meeting
in Geneva, come amid growing concern over the misuse and overuse
of these drugs, WHO said in a press release here Tuesday.
antimicrobials are also used to kill bacteria in animals for human
food.
</P>
<P>
The WHO recommendations are designed for sue by governments,
veterinary and other professional societies, industry and academia.
Major points include:
</P>
<P>
-- Obligatory prescriptions for all antimicrobials used for
disease control in food animals;
</P>
<P>
-- Termination or rapid phasing-out of the use of
antimicrobials for growth promotion if they are also used for
treatment of humans in the absence of a public health safety
evaluation;
</P>
<P>
-- Creation of national systems to monitor antimicrobial usage
in food animals;
</P>
<P>
-- Pre-licensing safety evaluation of antimicrobials with
consideration of potential resistance to human drugs;
</P>
<P>
-- Monitoring of resistance to identify emerging health
problems and timely corrective actions to protect human health;
</P>
<P>
-- Guidelines for veterinarians to reduce overuse and misuse of
antimicrobials in food animals.
</P>
<P>
According to WHO, overuse and misuse of antimicrobials in food
animals contribute to the emergence of resistant forms of disease-
causing bacteria. Such resistant bacteria can be transmitted from
food animals to humans, primarily via food. Infections can result
that are difficult to cure because the resistant bacteria do not
respond to treatment with antimicrobials.

<HEADLINE> Shortage of 10 Million Tons Seen in Russian Grain Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Russia will face a grain shortage
of 6 million to 10 million tons in the new farm year that ends
June 30, 2001, the president of the country's Grain Union said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
As Russia "will not manage without imports," Alexander Yukish
called for "immediate steps to stimulate grain imports throughout
the year," the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Yukish was addressing a round-table discussion on grain
supplies at the Chamber of Trade and Industry.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russia's Agriculture Minister Alexei Gordeyev said
Tuesday that the country could harvest 65 million tons of grain
this year in accordance with a "moderate to optimistic scenario,"
Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
The forecast was toned down from the ministry's earlier
projection of 70 million-75 million tons because the sector
witnessed cold weather at the beginning of May, when most grains
had already been sown, said Gordeyev, who also serves as a deputy
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia would face a shortfall of at least 2 million
tons of fodder grain until the new harvest starts to come in.
Prices for fodder grain have already doubled since January, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The government is consulting with major Russian and foreign
grain traders on ways to ease the situation with grain imports,
Gordeyev said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is considering an end to the 5 percent
duty on grain imports and a three-month grace period for VAT
payment.
</P>
<P>
Russia produced 54.7 million tons of grain in 1999, compared
with 47.8 million tons in 1998. The country needs 70 million tons
a year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Experts, Scientists Oppose Anti-Missile Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- A group of U.S. foreign policy
experts and scientists have lashed out at the proposed National
Missile Defense (NMD) program, dismissing it as a diplomatic and
technical liability that would endanger America's national
security.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to President Bill Clinton Monday, 33 experts on
Russia said that starting the setup of a nation-wide anti-missile
system would sour ties with Moscow, a strong NMD opponent, and
eventually undermine U.S. security.
</P>
<P>
"More time is needed to assess (NMD's) impact on international
relations, develop cooperative approaches to curbing missile
proliferation, and avoid re-igniting a new nuclear arms race," the
letter said.
</P>
<P>
It said that Russia was likely to put arms control on hold for
fear that its strategic forces would be undermined by a U.S. anti-
missile shield.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 35 scientists and engineers from 13 states went to
the Capitol Hill Monday to persuade Congressmen into rejecting the
missile defense program.
</P>
<P>
They said in a news release that the anti-missile system,
estimated to cost as much as 60 billion dollars, could be defeated
easily by relatively simple countermeasures, such as covering a
nuclear warhead with a shroud cooled to very low temperatures, or
hiding it in a mylar balloon with an empty balloon along side.
</P>
<P>
"Any country that can deploy a long-range missile with a
nuclear or biological weapon can deploy these countermeasures,"
said Joseph Lach, a physicist at Fermi National Accelerator
laboratory in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
Kurt Gottfried, a physics professor at Cornell University and
chairman of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said at a press
conference that the Pentagon's plan for the missile shield "may
never be ready. This is basically a flawed process."
</P>
<P>
Roy Danchick, a retired missile expert who worked for defense
contractor TRW, dismissed the hurry-up schedule as "a fatal rush
to deployment with a system that can't work."
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon successfully carried out an interception test last
October, but failed during the second test hit in January. The
next test is scheduled for early July, and more than a dozen
others are under plan.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton is to make final decision on whether the
national missile defense should be deployed this fall in
accordance with a report from the Pentagon based on the next
interception test in early July.

<HEADLINE> Drastic Climate in 21st Century Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Global warming in the 21st
century will likely cause drastic changes in the climate of the
United States, including potentially severe droughts, increased
risk of flood, mass migrations of species, and widespread erosion
of coastal zones, a new federal report released this week says.
</P>
<P>
The report, Climate Change Impacts on the United States: The
Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change, provides
the most detailed look ever at the possible impacts of global
warming on the United States over the next 100 years.
</P>
<P>
Among its key findings, the report indicates that continued
growth in worldwide emissions is likely to increase average
temperatures across the United States by 5-10 degrees Fahrenheit
by 2100.
</P>
<P>
Impacts such as heavier precipitation and increased drought
will vary widely from region to region, and some natural
ecosystems, such as alpine meadows, coral reefs, coastal wetlands
and Alaskan permafrost, are likely to deteriorate further and some
may disappear entirely, says the report.
</P>
<P>
Changes in rain and snowfall patterns could affect the
availability of fresh water, and crop productivity is likely to
rise nationally due to the fertilizing effect of more carbon
dioxide in the air, although regional cropping patterns may change
significantly.
</P>
<P>
Yet "for the nation as a whole, direct economic impacts are
likely to be modest," concludes the report, which is based on
computer models and historical data, and "American society would
likely be able to adapt to most of the impacts."
</P>
<P>
The program was authorized by Congress in 1990 and carried out
by nine federal agencies. The analysis was based largely on two
computer simulations of future climate that often produce very
different or even antithetical results.

<HEADLINE> Simitis: Greece Will Clamp Down on Terrorist Activity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis warned Tuesday that Greece would do its best to wipe out
terrorist activity, which has tarnished the country's image.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting with Greek President Costis
Stephanopoulos, Simitis said that the entire Greek society
condemned all acts of terrorism, and the most recent assassination
of Britain's defense attache in Greece, Stephen Saunders, who was
shot dead by two gunmen of the country's terrorist group, the
November 17, last Thursday as he was driving alone to work.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Greek government decided to increase a reward
of 500 million drachmas (about 1.42 million U.S. dollars) to 1
billion drachmas (about 2.84 million U.S. dollars) for anyone
providing information leading to the prosecution of November 17
members.
</P>
<P>
Authorities also announced that they found a stolen motorbike
used by the two attackers near the scene of last Thursday's
shooting incident.
</P>
<P>
With more pressures from the U.S. and Britain, Greece is now
considering restructuring its counter-terrorism and other police
forces, and the possibility of changes in the legal framework that
applies to the prosecution of suspected terrorists, including
proposals to abolish the jury system in such trials and to
institute a witness protection program.

in Washington Tuesday in an effort to resolve differences blocking
a final peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
"Discussions with the parties have begun," a State Department
official said.
</P>
<P>
Miller, deputy to U.S. Middle East peace talk coordinator

U.S. President Bill Clinton and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat will meet at the White House Thursday to discuss the issues
related to the peace process.

The U.S. side, as mediator, reportedly hopes the talks will
make enough progress for President Clinton to call a three-way
summit with Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak within
weeks.
</P>
<P>
The current negotiations, held despite uncertainty over the
peace process triggered by Syrian President Hafez Assad's sudden
death from a heart attack last weekend, are between delegations
led by Israeli Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami and
Palestinian Legislative Council Speaker Ahmed Korei.

UNITED NATIONS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Tuesday denied

<HEADLINE> Italian Police Seize Weapons Before OECD Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Local police of the Italian central
city of Bologna have seized a hefty haul of missiles and weapons
from radicals planning mayhem on the main day of the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) meeting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Police took the names of 14 young people, some of them from a
local squat and the others from an associated one in the northern
city of Turin.
</P>
<P>
They were charged with illegally carrying weapons.
</P>
<P>
Some of the weapons -- including steel cubes, nuts and bolts,
rocks, a crowbar, baseball bats and steel-clad batons -- came from
the local squat and others from a van that led an attempted dress
rehearsal for the protest Saturday, police said.
</P>
<P>
It was also announced that two "left-wing extremists" from
Parma were arrested Saturday night for damaging a patrol car with
a chain.
</P>
<P>
Police said they had also charged 75 young people from squats
all over Italy in connection with an anti-right demonstration on
May 13 in which a well-known central bar had its windows smashed.
</P>
<P>
Since that disturbance, police said they had seized canisters
full of petrol and pieces of tires used as forearm protection in
clashes with police.
</P>
<P>
Some 10,000 demonstrators are expected in Bologna Wednesday,
the majority of them pacifists but with a hard core that will try
to fight its way to the conference center.
</P>
<P>
Italy's multi-faceted protest against globalization took its
cue from the anti-WTO demonstration in Seattle in November and
against the International Monetary Fund/World Bank last month,
where many of the Italian protesters were present.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges Security Council to Demand Peace in DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Tuesday asked the Security Council to demand a halt to
fighting between Ugandan and Rwandan troops in Kisangani, a
diamond trade center in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC),
and their prompt withdrawal from the central African country.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief also called on the 15-nation body to demand the
early withdrawal of all other foreign forces from the country, the
former Zaire, as foreseen in an accord signed in Lusaka, capital
of Zambia, which is intended to end the many-sided conflict in the
country.
</P>
<P>
In both cases, Annan said, the Council should act under the
mandatory provisions of Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter, which
provides for possible sanctions or other punitive measures in the
event of noncompliance.
</P>
<P>
Annan also urged the Council to invoke Chapter VII of the U.N.
Charter "to demand the subsequent early withdrawal of all other
foreign forces" in the DRC, as foreseen in the Lusaka accord.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council Tuesday, Annan said the
situation in the DRC and prospects for further progress in the
peace process "have become particular uncertain."
</P>
<P>
In addition to the continued fighting, Annan cited the
government's decision not to take part in the preparatory meeting
for an inter-Congolese dialogue, its attempts to block
participation of the unarmed opposition, and "the chronic shortage
and delays" in providing resources for the facilitator of the
national dialogue appointed by the Organization of African Unity (
OAU), former Botswana President Ketumile Masire.
</P>
<P>
"These difficulties have been compounded by the government's
announcement, on June 9, of its withdrawal of confidence in Mr.
Masire," and its request to the OAU to nominate a new neutral
facilitator, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Organization mission in the DRC (MONUC), in its
current phase, comprises only about 228 military observers and
military liaison officers in and around the DRC, including 200 in
that country itself.
</P>
<P>
The fighting in the DRC pits the government of President
Laurent Kabila, backed by Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, against
rebel groups supported by Rwanda and Uganda.

<HEADLINE> Six Escaped Lions Shot Dead in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Six of eight lions that
escaped from the Mthethomusha game reserve near Nelspruit in
northeastern South Africa were shot dead Monday night.
</P>
<P>
African Eye News Service Tuesday quoted Mpumalanga Parks Board
spokesman Gary Sutter as saying that the animals were found in
bushes near Matsulu township, east of Nelspruit.
</P>
<P>
"Four of the lions were darted and euthanized, while the other
two had to be shot due to the treacherous nature of the terrain,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the two remaining lions, one of which was survived hit
by a car on the highway in the Crocodile Gorge on Saturday night,
were believed to be in a wooded area near the Lomshiyo Game/Cattle
Project -- a tribal- owned conservation area.
</P>
<P>
The lions have already hunted two head of cattle and rangers
are tracking their movements, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Sutter, this was not the first time this pride of
lions had escaped from Mthethomusha game reserve.
</P>
<P>
"Last time when the lions escaped, they killed six head of
cattle belonging to neighboring villagers," he said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that it was decided to kill the lions because they
had become "habitual problem animals".
</P>
<P>
"Once a lion begins hunting cattle there is little chance of
it being rehabilitated," he added.

<HEADLINE> HIV/AIDS Crisis worsened in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's national human resource
development goals and prospects for sustainable development will
continue to remain a distant dream unless the country holds back
the spread of HIV/AIDS, Zambian Finance and Economic Deputy
Minister Godfrey Simasiku said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to journalists in the capital, he said the HIV/AIDS
crisis in the country had been worsening over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Admitting Zambia being one of the worst HIV/AIDS epidemics in
the world, Simasiku estimated that nearly 20 per cent of the
adults aged between 15 to 49 years old were currently HIV
positive.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the HIV/AIDS crisis was also worsening the
effect of malaria-related morbidity and mortality among children
and pregnant women, with over 40,000 young people dying annually.
</P>
<P>
He said if not halted, the pandemic would have a tremendous
impact on the fight against malaria.
</P>
<P>
However, Simasiku noted that his government was doing
everything possible to ensure that HIV/AIDS prevention and
mitigation was built into the various sector investment plans.
</P>
<P>
He announced that Zambia would host a National Consultation
Conference on Orphans and Vulnerable Children in Lusaka at the end
of this year.
</P>
<P>
The government was proposing a multilateral and bilateral
debt-for- development arrangement to generate resources for use by
the private and public sectors to implement HIV/AIDS prevention
and mitigation programs, he added.
</P>
<P>
Simasiku called on all the cooperating partners and other
donors to assist the country fight the deadly disease to reduce
poverty and promote social and economic development.

<HEADLINE> 061335 Election Observers Free to Visit Any Part of Zimbabwe: Mugabe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Tuesday told the Commonwealth election observer mission led by
former Nigerian President Abdulsalami Abubakar that election
observers will be free to visit all areas in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"You will be free to move to any corner of the country. You
will be able to go to the farms, mines and the rural areas," he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Mugabe, Zimbabwe invited international observers
to the parliamentary election scheduled for June 24 and 25 because
there were some people who were already discrediting the election.
</P>
<P>
"We said to our people let's open up for others to see how we
do it. It is in that spirit that we exposed our own act for
everybody who wants to observe," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that free and fair elections were not a new
issue to Zimbabwe because the country had held all the past four
elections in a free and fair manner.
</P>
<P>
On his side, Abubakar distanced the observer group from
comments by Commonwealth Secretary-General Don Mckinnon that the
election would not be free and fair, saying that the Commonwealth
observer mission is not going to be influenced by reports in the
media.
</P>
<P>
Mckinnon told the British news agency, Reuters, on Sunday that
a free election would be difficult in Zimbabwe because of
intimidation and violence.
</P>
<P>
At least 26 people have died in Zimbabwe because of political
violence mainly between supporters of the ruling Zimbabwe African
National Union- Patriotic Front and the opposition Movement for
Democratic Change.

<HEADLINE> Collective Approach Against Crime in S. Africa Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 13 (Xinhua) -- South African Vice President
Jacob Zuma Tuesday attributed the recent success in police
anti-crime operations to a collective approach coupled with
improved efficiencies.
</P>
<P>
Without closer cooperation of various departments, the ongoing
Operation Crackdown would not have succeeded, he said, when
speaking during debate on President Thabo Mbeki's budget vote in
the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
According to the vice president, a total of 106,594 suspected
criminals were arrested in April and May this year compared to
58,413 in July and August last year.
</P>
<P>
The operation had also resulted in the recovery of 3,722 stolen
vehicles and 3,242 illegal firearms in the same period, he said.
</P>
<P>
"These improvements can be ascribed to better utilization of
intelligence, better interdepartmental cooperation, and a
significant improvement in the morale of members participating in
these operations," he added.
</P>
<P>
He observed that "crime prevention has been high on our agenda,
and as such we have continuously introduced measures to address
the issue."
</P>
<P>
The government, however, remains aware of the correlation
between crime and other social factors, including poverty, he
said.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 800 Eritrean troops
have fled to Sudan to escape fighting with Ethiopia and handed in
their arms to the Sudanese authorities, said a report reaching
here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
About 790 Eritrean soldiers and some 4,000 civilians crossed
the Eritrean-Sudanese border on Sunday after an Ethiopian

reported Al-Anbaa, an official newspaper in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean soldiers were given refugee status after being
disarmed and were admitted to Gerghef Camp, separate from the
civilian refugees, to join about 200 other soldiers who arrived
earlier, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Kassala State Governor Ibrahim Mohamoud Hamid
as saying that more Eritrean refugees are likely to come as a
result of the on- going fighting between Ethiopia and Eritrea.

<HEADLINE> 061318 Angola Builds More Classrooms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Construction of school buildings in
Angola has registered an 8 percent growth since 1999 as over 800
new classrooms were built across the country, the Ministry of
Education and Culture said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a document that despite the war, Angola's
school system has spread out with the building of new classrooms,
mainly along the coastal provinces.
</P>
<P>
As many as 855 new classrooms were constructed and refurbished
to cater for an estimated number of 79,880 students, the document
said.
</P>
<P>
However, the document noted that the educational situation in
general worsened in 1999 with the closing of many schools
especially at primary level due to increased fighting almost all
over the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, the problem of education in Angola
still remains far from being resolved, taking into consideration
the demographic structure which shows that 45 percent of the
country's population are youths and 55 percent of them under the
age of 20.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Armed Robberies Drastically Reduced in Harare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Cases of armed robbery have
drastically dropped in Zimbabwe's capital Harare since the
launching of "operation time- up" at the beginning of this month.
</P>
<P>
Police Inspector Tendai Nembire told the Zimbabwe News Agency
on Tuesday that before the launching of the operation the city
recorded an average of 15 armed robberies a week but now only four
a week.
</P>
<P>
"In May we recorded a total of 63 armed robberies but during
the first two weeks of June we have recorded only eight," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Under "operation time-up", police were mounting road blocks
along the city's major roads in search of wanted criminals and
stolen property.
</P>
<P>
According to Nembire, the operation was launched to curb the
rise in armed robbery and house breaking which had resulted in
cash and property worth about 500,000 U.S. dollars being lost to
robbers in May alone.

<HEADLINE> SADC Youth Meet in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The first youth conference of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) opened here on
Tuesday under the theme of "Health, Education and Participation".
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano
said "it was not easy to define these areas as priorities, because
the problems facing young people are many, complex and all call
for an urgent solution".
</P>
<P>
According to the president, although the speedy circulation of
people and goods within the region, encouraged by improved
transport, leads to rapid development, it also helps spread
diseases, particularly HIV, the virus that causes the lethal
disease AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"It was because it took into account that AIDS is no longer
just a health problem but a social one, which affects development,
that the August SADC summit decided to set up an intersectoral
team to draft regional strategies to fight against it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of education strategies, Chissano expressed hope that
this conference will throw up proposals that will help governments
find solutions to the question of access of youth to training that
will allow them to become usefully self-employed.
</P>
<P>
This will necessarily imply "partnerships between the state,
the private sector and civil society", he said.
</P>
<P>
On "participation", the president stressed the need for young
people to become involved in all facets of social activity.
</P>
<P>
He commented that youth is often described as "leaders of
tomorrow", but, actually, they are "the leaders of today".
</P>
<P>
The real leaders will be those who dedicate themselves and
participate in all activities "unselfishly", not thinking of
leadership, but of helping to solve the problems at hand, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged today's youth to be firmly determined in the fight
against AIDS and other endemic diseases as AIDS, poverty and
ignorance go hand in hand, and there is no way one can fight any
one of these phenomena while neglecting the others.
</P>
<P>
The president praised the capacity of the SADC youth
organizations to set up a regional executive secretariat for youth
affairs as a major step toward the integration of this social
group at regional level.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Carlos Simango, chairperson of the conference
executive committee, said during the opening ceremony that some of
the objectives of the meeting are to discuss how young people can
help in working out the political and economic agendas of their
respective countries, and the role they can play in facilitating
their implementation.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, due to end on Friday, brings together
representatives from all SADC member countries except the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, and also from various United
Nations agencies, which are providing technical support.

<HEADLINE> Angola Supports Efforts to Protect African Diamond </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government expressed
here on Tuesday its support for the joint works at the level of
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) with an aim to
produce resolutions for protecting the African diamond.
</P>
<P>
This statement was made by the Angolan Vice Minister of Geology
and Mining Carlos Sumbula at the opening ceremony of the meeting
of the African technical group on diamond being held in Luanda.
</P>
<P>
According to Sumbula, Angola is now doing well in the diamond
sector, making high-level fiscal revenues for the state budget.
</P>
<P>
He said the Angolan government has adopted a new policy since
August 1999, in a bid to stabilize the diamond sector and avoid
illicit diamond both in the local and foreign markets, in line
with the 1187 U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
Another aim of the new policy, he said, is to increase the so
far insignificant fiscal yieldings to the state budget, and
re-invest the incomes from diamond to secure the country's
economic sustainability.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting, presided over by Sumbula, were attended by
 representatives from Angola, the United States, Britain, Belgium,
South Africa, Namibia, Botswana and some non-governmental
organizations.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Agency Continues to Feed Refugees in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations' World Food
Program (WFP) Tuesday announced a three-year extension of its
refugee-feeding program in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Under its recently approved operation, WFP requires 85 million
U.S. dollars from donors to feed 187,000 refugees in northern
Kenya from October 2000 through September 2003.
</P>
<P>
"Food aid is essential to the survival of these refugees who
live in camps in Kenya until a time that they can return home,"
said Holdbrook Arther, WFP's Regional Manager for the Horn of
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The plight of the Somali and Sudanese refugees, who make up the
majority of the refugee population in Kenya, show no signs of
abating. Both countries continue to be torn by conflicts, which
have suffocated economic rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
WFP has supported refugees living in Kenya since 1991. Between
1991 and September 2000, WFP will have supplied 440,000 tons of
basic food for the refugees at a total cost of some 245 million
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Cairo-Tehran Ties Constantly Improve: Egyptian Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian-Iranian relations are
improving constantly, a move which has a significant role in
confidence building and enhancing mutual understanding, a senior
Egyptian diplomat in Tehran said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Iran severed the diplomatic relations with Egypt in 1979 after
Egypt signed a peace agreement with Israel, which Iran does not
recognize and sees as its arch-enemy. But Cairo and Tehran have
been joining efforts to improve the ties in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Iran often coordinate stances on multilateral issues
within the United Nations, the Organization of Islamic Conference
and the Non-Alignment Movement, Mohamed Refahah, head of the
Egyptian Interest Section in Tehran, said in an interview with
Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Economic cooperation has also developed between the two
countries as several products exhibitions have been and will be
held both in Cairo and Tehran to activate bilateral trade ties,
Refahah said.
</P>
<P>
Iran held an exhibition in Cairo in November, 1999 and took part
in the Cairo International Trade Fair last March, both of which
were the first since 1979. Meanwhile, an Egyptian products
exhibition will be staged in Tehran on June 25 through July 1, also
to be the first over 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Despite of the absence of diplomatic relations, the two
countries are quite active in investment and trade cooperation.
Iran has so far invested in Egypt 190 million U.S. dollars,
accounting for 5 percent of the total foreign investments in Egypt.
Their trade volume stands at an annual 12 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Egyptian Information Minister Safwat el-Sharif has
invited Iranian Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance Ataollah
Mohajerani to visit Egypt, the first at the ministerial level, the
Egyptian diplomat disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have exchanged visits by officials in the
recent years only for multilateral and international events.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Convene Summit on Security of International Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The third Summit on the
Security and Independence of the International Civil Service will
be held here Thursday in a bid to address the increasing security
problems faced by the United Nations and associated personnel
around the world, U.N. officials said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The event is organized by the United Nations Staff Council
Standing Committee on the Security and Independence of the
International Civil Service, in cooperation with the Coordinating
Committee for International Staff Unions and Associations of the
United Nations System.
</P>
<P>
The summit will seek to mobilize action to ensure the safety
and security of staff worldwide which, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said at the second summit, "is a non-negotiable issue."
</P>
<P>
The summit will review the current security situation in the
field and follow up on the decisions taken by the U.N. Security
Council and the General Assembly on that issue.
</P>
<P>
Between 1992 and January 31, 2000, 184 civilian staff members
were killed and 28 taken hostage or kidnapped. In addition, there
were 292 reported violent incidents against United Nations staff
throughout the world, including violent robbery, physical assault
and rape.
</P>
<P>
The plenary session will be opened by Annan. Invited speakers
include General Assembly President Theo-Ben Gurirab, Security
Council President Jean-David Levitte, Economic and Social Council
President Makarim Wibisono, and United Nations Security
Coordinator Benon Sevan.
</P>
<P>
The panel discussion will cover the political, legal, physical
and psychological aspects of protection of United Nations staff
and locally recruited and associated personnel.
</P>
<P>
A special presentation will honor the countries that have
ratified, since the last summit, the 1994 United Nations
Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated
Personnel -- Bangladesh, Botswana, Croatia, Hungry, Poland,
Senegal and Uruguay. Thirty-two countries have ratified the
convention.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Retail Sales Drop for Second Month in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. retail sales dropped for
the second month in a row in May, a new evidence that stiffer
credit costs were sapping consumer spending, the Commerce
Department reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales nationwide fell 0.3 percent to a seasonally
adjusted rate of 266 billion U.S. dollars last month, the first
back-to-back decline since July and August of 1998. In April,
retail sales fell 0.6 percent, much weaker than the government
estimated one month ago.
</P>
<P>
Sales at hardware, building and garden supply stores posted the
biggest decline in May, falling 1.6 percent after a 3.8 percent
drop the month before. Many economists have predicted sales for
these type of products could slow as the red-hot housing market is
beginning to show signs of cooling.
</P>
<P>
Sales of new cars and trucks fell 1.3 percent in May after a 1.
2 percent decline in April.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile autos category, retail sales were
unchanged in May, weaker than many analysts were expecting. They
predicted that retail sales, excluding autos, would have gone up
by 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, many of the nation's biggest chain stores
reported lackluster sales in May. Economists mostly blamed cool
temperatures for the decline.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised short-term interest rates six
times since last June in an effort to slow the speeding economy
and its main engine, consumer spending, which accounts for two-
thirds of all economic activity.
</P>
<P>
Those rate increases are designed to make borrowing more
expensive and thus cool demand for big-ticket items such as cars
and homes, a move that would help keep inflation from escalating.
</P>
<P>
As recent economic reports suggest that the economy has begun
slowing, economists have offered conflicting opinions on whether
or not the Fed will need to boost rates again when it meets later
this month.

PYONGYANG -- Both DPRK senior leader Kim Yong Nam and visiting
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung have pinned high hopes on the
landmark inter-Korea summit that enters formal rounds Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hosting a dinner in honor of Kim Dae-jung at the People's
Palace of Culture, Kim Yong Nam, president of the Presidium of the
Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK), said the June 13-15 summit has attracted the whole
world's attention.
</P>
<P>
Extending his warm welcome to the South Korean president, Kim
Yong Nam expressed the hope that Kim Dae-jung's talks with DPRK
leader Kim Jong Il will be significantly helpful in realizing the
national reunification.
</P>
<P>
Kim said that it is the time for leaders of the North and the
South with sense of responsibility to seek to end the 55-year-long
division of the peninsula and realize national reunification, a
question facing the 70 million Koreans.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Kim Dae-jung expressed the hope that through his
visit, the "half century of distrust and confrontation will change
into reconciliation and cooperation" and "reunions of the
separated families will be realized."
</P>
<P>
He called for the unity between the North and South to survive
the fierce international competition.
</P>
<P>
He also called for opening railway, sea lanes and air routes
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
In an cordial and friendly atmosphere, both leaders proposed
toasts to the peaceful reunification of the nation. (DRPK-SKorea)

NEW DELHI -- Seventeen people, including a local ruling party
leader and 13 militants, were killed in Jammu and Kashmir since
Monday evening, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ghulam Mohammad Reshi, a block president of the ruling National
Conference, and his personal security officer were killed by
militants in Baramulla district in west Kashmir on Monday evening,
the PTI quoted an official spokesman in Srinagar, capital of Jammu
and Kashmir, as saying. The militants fired at the two while they
were returning from a nearby market, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
In a major encounter in the frontier district of Kupwara in
west Kashmir on Tuesday, four militants, including two "foreign
mercenaries," were killed by the Indian security force, the
spokesman told the PTI.
</P>
<P>
Militants and security forces also clashed at several places in
Kupwara on Monday, which left seven militants dead, the spokesman
added. (India-Kashmir-Clash)

JERUSALEM -- Israel's ultra-orthodox religious Shas party,
which holds 17 seats in the 120-member Knesset (parliament),
announced Tuesday it will quit the coalition government of Prime
Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
The party's policy-making Council of Torah Sages made the
decision after an urgent meeting Tuesday morning and the decision
was final, party leader Eli Yishai said in a televised interview.
</P>
<P>
Yishai, who holds the Labor and Social Affairs portfolio, also
announced the negotiations between Shas and Barak's One Israel
party aiming to resolve the coalition crisis had come to an end.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the sages panel's secretary Rafael Pinhasif said "The
Council of Torah Sages has told the Shas ministers and its
deputies to submit resignation letters in the upcoming cabinet
meeting and to quit the coalition."
</P>
<P>
The cabinet is scheduled to convene on Sunday, but there are
reports that the resignation will take affect in 48 hours. It is
not clear whether the party will back down at the last minute this
time as it had done several times before.
</P>
<P>
Tommy Lapid, leader of the secular Shinui Party, had already
predicted that Tuesday's announcement of a planned party
resignation by Shas is another political ploy to raise the price
it will cost Barak to keep Shas on board.
</P>
<P>
If carried out, the quitting will make the Barak administration,
currently having a 68-52 majority in Israel's 15th Knesset, shrink
to a 51-seat minority government.(Israel-Coalition Crisis)

<HEADLINE> China's Tibetological Research Enjoys Unprecedented Prosperity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- China's Tibetological research is
enjoying "unprecedented prosperity". This is a consensus reached
by the participants in the first national symposium on Tibetology
which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Tibetologists have published at least 6,000
Tibetological articles and more than 1,000 academic books.
</P>
<P>
China has over 50 Tibetology research institutes and over 2,000
Tibetologists. Before the founding of the People's Republic in
1949, there were no Tibet Research Institutes.
</P>
<P>
China has trained more than 200 post-graduates and a dozen Ph.D.
students in Tibetology in the past decades. Most are young or
middle-aged scholars who have not only mastered Chinese and
Tibetan, but also English or other foreign languages.
</P>
<P>
China's Tibetan scholars sponsored three international
symposiums on Tibetology in 1986, 1991 and 1997. During the third
symposium, there were more than 130 researchers from China. They
submitted over 100 papers.
</P>
<P>
Experts pointed out that Chinese Tibetologists are important in
promoting the research of Tibet and in paving the way for Tibet's
reform and progress.

in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) organized the two-
day symposium.
</P>
<P>

development suited to their respective countries, particularly at
the threshold of a new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Li, also member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) Central Committee, said that by combining the
universal truth of Marxism with practice, and with the efforts of
millions of people led by the communist party, socialism is sure
to prosper.

The CPC has led the Chinese people to achieve outstanding feats
in building socialism with Chinese characteristics over the past
50 years, the past two decades in particular, Li said.

<HEADLINE> China Plans to Allow Trading of State-Held Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese government plans to let
State shares of listed companies go into circulation as part of
its efforts to raise funds for security funds for retirees and the
jobless.
</P>
<P>
Xiang Huaicheng, minister of finance, announced the plan here
today at an "International Workshop on Mobilizing Additional
Resources Through SOE Reform for Establishing a Social Security
System".
</P>
<P>
"The circulation of State-own shares is only a matter of time,"
the official said. It is rational to cash some State assets to
raise funds for social security purposes, Xiang said.
</P>
<P>
Generally, the government holds more than 70 percent of shares
in a State-controled company, but up to now, the government has
not allowed any State shares to go into trading.
</P>
<P>
The capital market should give priority to "reform" and "re-
organization" in the current restructuring of State reforms, said
the official.
</P>
<P>
China is trying to build up a social security system that
raises funds from several channels, Xiang said, adding that the
setting up of a perfect social security system is directly linked
to the implementation of policies to help relieve State
enterprises from difficulties.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong to Improve Trade Ties with African Countries: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 13 (Xinhua) -- China's most export-oriented
province of Guangdong said today that Africa is one of its most
important trading partners and investment destinations.
</P>
<P>
Tang Hao, deputy director of the Development Planning
Commission of Guangdong Province, said Guangdong attaches great
importance to economic and trade cooperation with African
countries as the region is abundant in natural resources. The
market also has enormous potential.
</P>
<P>
He said Guangdong will set up processing plants in several
African countries.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong recorded a trade volume of 1.56 billion U.S. dollars
last year with African countries. There were 642 million U.S.
dollars of imports from Africa.
</P>
<P>
The province's trade with Africa has been increasing by 13
percent on average during the past five years, about 5.2 percent
higher than the province's foreign trade performance during the
same period, he said.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong has set up over 600 factories overseas. It will also
set up a motorcycle factory in Angola involving two million U.S.
dollars and another one in Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Confident in Syrian People's Rising Above Loss of Leader: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Egypt believes that the Syrian people
will overcome their grief over the death of President Hafez al-
Assad and rise above the loss of the leader, President Hosni
Mubarak's political advisor Osama al-Baz said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
To Syria, the smooth process of power transfer to Bashar al-
Assad, the late president's son, means continuity and further
stability, progress and success, al-Baz told Egypt's Middle East
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Al-Baz was in Syria's capital of Damascus, accompanying Mubarak
for al-Assad's funeral.
</P>
<P>
Assad died of a heart attack at the age of 69 on Saturday.
Shortly after the announcement of his passing, Bashar was nominated
for the Syrian presidency and promoted to commander-in-chief of the
armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Syria has played and will further play a pivotal role in the
Arab politics and regional affairs, al-Baz said.
</P>
<P>
Terming the Egyptian-Syrian relations as strategic, he said that
Syria has been Egypt's close partner in many issues and that
history has witnessed the solidarity between Cairo and Damascus,
which has contributed to a firm Arab stance in defending national
rights.
</P>
<P>
"President Mubarak was among the first to express solidarity
with the people, the leadership and army of Syria," he said, adding
that Damascus will never stand alone in dealing with regional and
international issues, especially the Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Shas Party Quits Coalition EDS-Updates with more details and backgrounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Israel's ultra-orthodox religious
Shas party, which holds 17 seats in the 120-member Knesset
(parliament), announced Tuesday it will quit the coalition
government of Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
The party's policy-making Council of Torah Sages made the
decision after an urgent meeting Tuesday morning and the decision
was final, party leader Eli Yishai said in a televised interview.
</P>
<P>
Yishai, who holds the Labor and Social Affairs portfolio, also
announced the negotiations between Shas and Barak's One Israel
party aiming to resolve the coalition crisis had come to an end.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the sages panel's secretary Rafael Pinhasif said "The
Council of Torah Sages has told the Shas ministers and its deputies
to submit resignation letters in the upcoming cabinet meeting and
to quit the coalition."
</P>
<P>
The cabinet is scheduled to convene on Sunday, but there are
reports that the resignation will take affect in 48 hours. It is
not clear whether the party will back down at the last minute this
time as it had done several times before.
</P>
<P>
Tommy Lapid, leader of the secular Shinui Party, had already
predicted that Tuesday's announcement of a planned party
resignation by Shas is another political ploy to raise the price it
will cost Barak to keep Shas on board.
</P>
<P>
If carried out, the quitting will make the Barak administration,
currently having a 68-52 majority in Israel's 15th Knesset, shrink
to a 51-seat minority government.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Yisrael Ba'aliya and National Religious Party (NRP),
Shas' two right-wing fellows in the coalition, may follow suit,
further reducing Barak's control in the Knesset to 42 seats and
declaring the de facto death of Barak's 11-month-old coalition.
</P>
<P>
The crisis will surely hamper Barak's peace efforts for reaching
peace deals with the Palestinians and Syrians, as all such
agreements should wait for parliamentary approval.
</P>
<P>
All the three parties, which Barak included in his coalition
last July to broaden the support base for peace talks with Arab
countries, voted along the oppositions last Wednesday in a
preliminary reading in favor of a bill calling for early elections.
</P>
<P>
The major contention point between Shas and Barak is Shas'
demands for millions of additional dollars to save its corrupt and
almost-bankrupt educational network, which is believed by many
analysts as the real drive behind the party's rebellious acts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yisrael Ba'aliya and NRP are against making
concessions to the Palestinians in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators, which
just resumed Tuesday in the United States, are intended to reach a
framework agreement and a final accord by September on final-status
issues, such as the fate of Jerusalem, the return of Palestinian
refugees, Jewish settlements, border, security and water.
</P>
<P>
Israel is also hoping to reopen the talks with Syria, which
broke off early January due to Syria's insistence that Israel
pledge to the return of the Golan Heights it seized from Syria in
the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
Barak is now left with two options to cope with the situation.
The first option is to form a new government without the religious
parties.
</P>
<P>
The six-seat secular Shinui party, the two-seat Democratic List
and the two-seat Am Ehad (One Nation) will be major candidates to
fill the government vacuum left by Shas. Such a government will be
a 52-seat minority, whose survival depends on the support from 10
Knesset members of Israeli Arab parties outside the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Barak can also try to persuade the major opposition Likud, who
holds 19 seats in the Knesset, to participate in a national unity
government.
</P>
<P>
A Gallup poll published on Tuesday showed that the majority of
Israelis (57.6 percent) prefer such a national unity government
with Likud over a coalition with the religious parties.
</P>
<P>
The poll has also revealed that 46.5 percent interviewees favor
a narrow coalition with Shinui, Democratic List and Am Ehad, while
39.5 percent want to see a broad-based coalition with Shas, Yisrael
Ba'aliya, and NRP.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Fiscal Deficit is Sustainable: WB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank Tuesday said that
Bangladesh's present level of fiscal deficit was sustainable
provided the quality of expenditure is good.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press briefing at the bank's office here, Roberto
Zagha, sector manager, South Asia Region of the World Bank said
that "fiscal deficit is not a problem but quality spending is a
must."
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi Finance Minister Shah AMS Kibria last Thursday
placed a national budget of 8.5 billion U.S. dollars for fiscal
2000-2001 in the parliament, showing an overall deficit of 3.7
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance called for a countrywide general strike
Monday against what they said government's "anti-people budget."
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question, Roberto Zagha pointed out that the
danger to the economy of Bangladesh is that expenditure quality in
the country is extremely poor. "We are concerned over a number of
projects in the Annual Development Program which are not viable
economically," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the regional official of the World Bank noted that
Bangladesh's success over the past 11 months was remarkable. The
growth rate was high at 5 to 5.5 percent, he said, adding that
Bangladesh's economy was the 8th fastest economy of the world.
</P>
<P>
According to Zagha, the growth of the agriculture sector and
export was remarkable. Some progresses have been made in poverty
alleviation.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank official, however, said that the budget document
lacked future directives of trade policy and structural reforms.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Extends Deadline for Tax Submission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The South African Revenue
Service (SARS) said on Tuesday that it had extended the deadline
for submission of this year's tax returns to August 31after some
employers asked for extension because they were experiencing
problems in issuing employees tax certificates.
</P>
<P>
"It must be emphasized that this does not represent a general
extension for all taxpayers but merely a concession to those
taxpayers who could not obtain their certificates timely," said
SARS spokesman Christo Henning in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He said employers were granted more time after it emerged that
the new format was complex to most companies. This resulted in the
process running slower than anticipated, Henning added.
</P>
<P>
Taxpayers who required an extension beyond August 31 would have
to apply to their local Receiver of Revenue to prevent a penalty
being imposed.

<HEADLINE> Austrian Sanction Not on EU Summit Agenda, Portuguese FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The lifting of sanctions against
Austria will not be on the agenda of the European Union (EU)
summit meeting next week, said Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime
Gama in Luxembourg on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
EU heads of state and government are not scheduled to discuss
lifting sanctions imposed on Austria after the far-right freedom
party joined the coalition government this February, said Gama at
a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese foreign minister made the remark after the EU
foreign ministers met in Luxembourg and discussed issues ranging
from the Balkans, Africa, EU enlargement, European defense and
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
No one was forbidden to raise other topics at the summit, said
Gama, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
Austria has been contacting EU member states in an attempt to
persuade them to lift sanctions before the Portuguese EU
presidency ends.
</P>
<P>
France will hold the EU presidency after Portugal, and France
and Belgium have been strong opponents against the far-right
Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
The EU member states decided to impose sanctions while the
European Union still conducts routine business with Austria.
</P>
<P>
Austria was not on the agenda of the EU summit because it was
not an EU issue, said Gama. When asked whether it was double-talk
to describe the issue of Austria as not an EU matter, Gama said
that it was only a different perspective but could be described as
a contribution toward the union, though a negative one.
</P>
<P>
The EU is due to hold a summit meeting June 19-20 at Santa
Maria da Feira, some 40 kilometers away from the Portuguese
northern city of Porto.

China's drive to reform its rural economy is the major reason
for grain acreage reduction, the Ministry says, adding that wheat
and corn acreage will be reduced while quality early paddy acreage
will increase by 3.53 million hectares.

<HEADLINE> China, GEF in Cooperation to Protect Wild Camels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- China will set up a large nature
reserve in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in
cooperation with the Global Environment Facility (GEF) to protect
China's wild camels from poaching, officials said here today.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yexu, an official with the State Environmental Protection
Administration of China, said the planned nature reserve will
cover 150,000 sq. km, one of the largest nature reserves in the
world.
</P>
<P>
A publicity campaign will soon be launched to improve public
awareness of wild camel protection. The campaign will receive GEF
funding as part of biodiversity protection in the Altun Mountains-
Lop Nur Nature Reserve.
</P>
<P>
John Hare, founder of the Wild Camel Protection Foundation
based in England, told reporters today that there are about 650
wild camels in Xinjiang and 350 in Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
Hare, who works for the United Nations Environment Program,
explained that wild camels in Mongolia have access to fresh water
while those in Xinjiang do not.
</P>
<P>
"DNA tests in Germany, the United States and Kenya show that
there is a three percent difference between the wild camels and
the domestic ones," Hare said. "The difference is significant as
the genetic difference between human beings and Chimpanzees is
only five percent."
</P>
<P>
The biggest threat of the wild camels in Xinjiang is poaching,
including traditional hunting by local residents and hunting by
illegal miners for food, he added.
</P>
<P>
A number of check points will be set up to control the entry of
potential poachers into the planned reserve with assistance from
GEF.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum of understanding on the protection of wild camels
is expected to be signed here next August by top Chinese and
Mongolian officials in charge of nature reserves.
</P>
<P>
Hare, who has been facilitating cooperation between China and
GEF, said international workshops will also be arranged in Beijing
to discuss DNA difference and management of nature reserves and
artificial breeding of the endangered species.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President Vows to Improve Ties With Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer
on Tuesday pledged to improve relations with neighboring Syria.
</P>
<P>
Sezer was speaking at the Esenborga Airport before leaving for
the Syrian capital of Damascus to attend the funeral of late Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad, who died a heart attack on Saturday at
the age of 69.
</P>
<P>
"I want to emphasize that we will maintain our good will to
improve our relations with Syria. We are ready to cooperate with
the new Syrian leader to this end," said Sezer.
</P>
<P>
Sezer, accompanied by Culture Minister Istemihan Talay, is
making his first trip abroad since assuming office on May 16.
</P>
<P>
President Sezer expressed hope to "fulfil neighborhood
responsibilities by conveying our condolences to the Syrian people
at the funeral."
</P>
<P>
"The demise of President Assad, who contributed to stability and
prosperity of Syria for years, is a grave loss for Syria," he said.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Turkey have been at odds mainly over security-related
issues for more than a decade. Syria was unhappy with the military
relations between Turkey and Israel, while Ankara accused Damascus
of supporting the separatist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) banned
by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The dispute almost deteriorated into military conflict early
last year when Turkey threatened to attack Syria for sheltering
Abdullah Ocalan, the PKK leader pursued by Turkey at that time.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors made great efforts later to improve political,
economic and military relations between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
It was widely believed that Sezer's participation in Assad's
funeral will herald the beginning of a new era in the bilateral
ties.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland Grants Aid to Iran for Anti-Drug Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss government has decided to
grant 140,000 U.S. dollars to Iran to help it carry out an anti-
drug campaign.
</P>
<P>
During negotiations held here between a Swiss police delegation
and the secretary-general of Iran's Anti-Drug Headquarters, a
memorandum of understanding was signed in this regard, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum also provides for discussion of areas of
cooperation, particularly in designating dirty money earned from
drug smuggling.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss delegation, which arrived here on June 7, observed the
activities of Iran's security forces stationed in its joint borders
with Afghanistan and Pakistan, the sources of drugs smuggled to
Iran. Iran has been used as a main route for smuggling drugs
from Pakistan and Afghanistan, the world's largest opium producer,
to Europe and oil-rich Gulf Arab states.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic republic started a strict anti-drug campaign in 1989
after the Majlis (parliament) passed an anti-drug law authorizing
capital punishment for drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1979 Islamic revolution, Iran has spent more than one
billion U.S. dollars in anti-drug campaigns and about 3,000 Iranian
anti-drug forces have been killed in clashes with drug traffickers.

<P>
DHAKA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The much-awaited Rooppur Nuclear
Power Plant project would start as soon as possible with the
availability of fund, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said in a reply
tabled in the parliament Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question, the prime minister said the proposed
nuclear power plant is estimated to produce 600-megawatt
electricity. Later a second plant with a capacity of 600 megawatts
will be set up at the same site, she added.
</P>
<P>
The director general of International Atomic Energy Agency has
given assurance of implementing the project, and assurance of
cooperation was also received for execution of different phases of
the project, Hasina said.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear power project, initiated in 1962 at Ishwardi in
Pabna, 160 kilometers west of Dhaka, was virtually stalled due to
lack of interest by the previous governments as well as a shortage
of fund and technological assistance.
</P>
<P>
The initial cost of the plant is likely to be 900 million to
one billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Opposition Party Founder Breaks With his Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maputo, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Relations between the current
leadership of the opposition Mozambique United Front (FUMO) and
the party's founder Domingos Arouca seemed to have completely
collapsed as Arouca rejecting the post of "honorary president"
offered to him by the FUMO congress held at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
"I have nothing to do with this FUMO, and this FUMO has nothing
to do with me," declared Arouca in an interview published on the
daily newspaper Noticias Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I don't recognize the post they've given me, because this FUMO
means nothing to me," said Arouca, who did not attend the
congress.
</P>
<P>
"I vehemently repudiate the title of honorary president. I
don't recognize it because I wasn't even consulted about it."
</P>
<P>
He said he would be unable to collaborate with the party he
created 24 years ago when he was in exile "as long as those people
are there."
</P>
<P>
According to the report, "those people" are the FUMO's new
president Jose Samo Gudo, who is also FUMO's only member of
parliament, Vice President Simeao Cuamba and Secretary-General
Pedro Loforte.
</P>
<P>
The rift began last year, when Arouca opposed going into
coalition with the former rebel movement RENAMO (Mozambique
National Resistance Movement). But the majority of the FUMO
leadership took the party into RENAMO's " electoral union", and
Arouca promptly resigned as FUMO president, though retaining his
party membership.
</P>
<P>
The hostility is mutual.  Samo Gudo said that, having rejected
the post of honorary president, Arouca "will be forgotten", adding
that he had lost the chance "to remain alive politically."
</P>
<P>
He said the congress complied with their duty of trying to
maintain this historically important figure within the party.
</P>
<P>
He deplored "the lack of respect to the party's bodies shown by
Arouca," and insisted that FUMO would not change its current
political line to accommodate its founder.

<HEADLINE> Six Killed, 20 Wounded by Unknown Gunmen in Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 13 (Xinhua) -- At least six people were killed
and nearly 20 others wounded when unidentified gunmen attacked the
Hararyalleh residential quarter in South Mogadishu, Somalia,
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses, the perpetrators of the attack
crossed from North Mogadishu, took the former presidential palace
road and turned on the Wadnaha street before opening an
indiscriminate fire on the unarmed civilians around the mini-khat
and fuel market of Hararyalleh.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen, about seven of them, driving a pickup mounted with
an anti- aircraft heavy machine gun, opened fire in every
direction before escaping unhurt into the darkness along the road
of Hirtah.
</P>
<P>
There had been no resistance or return of fire against the
attackers during the operation even though Hararyalleh area is one
of the pockets of land in Mogadishu controlled by the Islamic
courts.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the attack is not officially disclosed. However,
most of the local people pointed the finger of blame on Bashir
Rageh Shirar, a well- known Warsangeli sub-clan businessman living
in North Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
One of the eyewitnesses even said that he recognized the
vehicle and the driver of Shirar personally during the attack.
</P>
<P>
Shirar has reportedly carried out the attack in response to an
earlier assault against one of his vehicles in Hararyalleh area
two days ago in which one of his men was killed and two others
wounded.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen who attacked Shirar's vehicle have claimed that the
vehicle was looted from their clan during heavy clannish fighting
in Medina area five years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, when contacted last night, Shirar distanced himself
from being involved in the attack in Hararyalleh, stressing that
all his fighters were busy at the Issaley airport and a wedding
ceremony in his place Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The insecurity and banditry-related attacks have been on the
increase in the past 10 days. However, attacking crowds of
civilians on clan-related animosity has long been forgotten in
Mogadishu since the Cairo peace deal was signed three years ago
when all of the green lines that divided the capital were
abolished.
</P>
<P>
Following the massacre, more than one hundred people took to
the streets of the Hararyalleh residential quarter Tuesday
morning, shouting words against the Islamic court responsible for
the security in the area.
</P>
<P>
They demanded the Islamic court officials either to guarantee
their security fully or leave them alone to deal with the
situation by taking the law in their hands.

</P>
<P>
The conditions fall short of internationally-accepted standards,
the EU said.
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers said the international observers were
there with the consent of the Zimbabwean authorities and expected
the government of the African country would make good its
assurances about security and freedom of access for the observers.
</P>
<P>
The EU urged the Zimbabwean authorities to assist the
international observers in their work so as to increase confidence
in the electoral process.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers reiterated their serious concern over the
ongoing violence and intimidation in Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Russia Proposes "Political Umbrella" Against Missile Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev proposed Tuesday to his U.S. counterpart that the two
countries jointly set up a "political umbrella" to prevent missile
threats.
</P>
<P>
This umbrella would make the proposed U.S. national missile
defense system unnecessary, Sergeyev told reporters following his
meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
Washington is seeking revisions to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty (ABM) to pave the way for its planned national
missile defense program, but Sergeyev said that Russia believes
the treaty cannot be updated without violating it.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev, quoted by the Interfax news agency, said the "
umbrella" should be built on mutual understanding and commitments
that must be covered by a verification system.
</P>
<P>
It would be more efficient, less expensive and less dangerous
as far as infringement on the interests of others is concerned, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The umbrella "will serve the interests of numerous countries
and strategic stability and be in place for a long time," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Russia had earlier proposed a joint Russia-U.S. missile defense
system, but Washington is lukewarm to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Cohen also met with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday.
Putin emphasized the importance of continuing bilateral contacts,
especially between the defense agencies and in the area of
international security, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
"Such contacts are needed to build confidence and create a
favorable background for cooperation between Russia and the United
States in bilateral relations and on the international scene," the
Kremlin press service quoted Putin as saying.
</P>
<P>
Putin reiterated "the essential importance of preventing steps
that could undermine the 1972 ABM Treaty and the strategic
stability in the world," the press service said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, which was attended also by Sergeyev, the
two sides discussed Moscow's initiative on setting up a European
anti-missile defense system.

<HEADLINE> EU Reiterates Aid to East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Union reiterated
its intention to provide financial aid to East Timor Tuesday, with
10 million euros (9.4 million U.S. dollars) pledged this year via
the World Bank trust fund.
</P>
<P>
The pledge was reiterated after the foreign ministers of the 15-
nation bloc heard a briefing by Vieira de Mello, special
representative of the United Nations secretary-general and
transitory administrator in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Christopher Patten, the EU external relations commissioner,
said the European Union had already provided East Timor with 15
million euros (14.1 million dollars) as humanitarian aid. The new
aid, plus contributions from other donors, would boost the amount
to 19 million euros, and would be used to rebuild houses and
repair roads, said the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with the European Union foreign ministers, De
Mello discussed the remoteness of East Timor, where outside aid
seldom reaches and the infrastructure has been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The East Timorese have expressed their frustration in recent
weeks about the progress of reconstruction and rehabilitation,
according to the U.N. official.
</P>
<P>
De Mello said that he was to brief the United Nations Security
Council within 10 days about a proposal which he described as "far-
reaching." The proposal by the United Nations offered senior East
Timorese with administrative posts in the transitory
administration in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The East Timorese expressed their willingness to cooperate with
the U.N. transitory administration politically, financially and
militarily.
</P>
<P>
The international presence in East Timor will last until it
becomes fully independent, said de Mello. East Timor last year
voted for outright independence from Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Photographer Back to France After 9 Months of Captivity in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- A French freelance photographer
taken hostage for nearly nine months by separatists in Russia's
Chechnya Republic, returned home Tuesday from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Arriving at the military airport of Villacoublay outside Paris
on a plane sent by the French government, 32-year-old Brice
Fleutiaux was greeted by his daughter, wife and mother as well as
the Delegate Minister of Cooperation Charles Josselin and a
representative of President Jacques.
</P>
<P>
He is due to give a press conference Tuesday afternoon on the
story of his captivity, which dates from October 1, 1999, the day
he arrived illegally at Grozny from Georgia without a visa from
the Russian embassy in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The French Foreign Ministry denied that France paid the
kidnappers a ransom to obtain his release.
</P>
<P>
"Contrary to rumors, the release of Brice Fleutiaux did not
take place with the payment of a ransom and no intermediary played
any useful role (in his release)," said a Foreign Ministry
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also refused to comment on a report that
Fleutiaux was swapped for "an important figure of Chechnya"
captured by the Russian authorities.
</P>
<P>
When announcing his release on Monday, the Russian Interior
Ministry said that no deal was made with the Chechens.
</P>
<P>
Fleutiaux was given a half-an-hour reception by Russian
President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin on Monday.

WASHINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Microbes that cause diseases ranging from sore throats and
pneumonia to malaria and AIDS are mutating at an alarming rate
around the globe into much more dangerous infections that fail to
respond to drugs, the World Health Organization warned.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The leaders of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and
South Korea met Tuesday in Pyongyang for a first-ever series of
talks for the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
-- Projections of the federal budget surplus are likely to be
revised upward by as much as one trillion U.S. dollars in coming
weeks, leading Vice President Albert Gore and Governor George W.
Bush to prepare differing claims to the windfall.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. government told a federal judge that resolving the
Microsoft Corp. antitrust case is so urgent to the nation's
economy that it should go straight to the Supreme Court, but
Microsoft is seeking to delay the move.
</P>
<P>
-- The price for unleaded regular gasoline surged to a record 1.
63 dollars a gallon last week, the U.S. government reported, as

<P>
PARIS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
demonstrated France's support to Syria's strategic choice for
peace when he attended the state funeral of President Hafez Assad
in the Syrian capital of Damascus Tuesday, said a spokesman of the
French Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Chirac was the only Western head of state present at the
funeral.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that what is important is to support Syria's
strategic choice for peace, which Damascus made at the Madrid
Conference on the Middle East in 1991.
</P>
<P>
"The presence of President Chirac, accompanied by Foreign
Minister Hubert Vedrine, at the funeral of President Assad is
intended to express the commitment of France to support the peace
process at a crucial moment for the region and in the wake of the
Israeli pullout from southern Lebanon," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"We want a comprehensive peace that includes all wings of the
peace process and cannot be accomplished without Syria, a key
element for this peace," he added.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Ruling Has No Immediate Effects on China Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft's ruling will not
produce any impact on its Chinese business in the near future,
said an high ranking official from Microsoft China.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled on Wednesday
that Microsoft violated U.S. antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
The news has not cause much concern in China but it was still a
top story in many newspapers in China. Microsoft's Windows is as
widely used in China as it is used in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Fengming Liu, Deputy General Manager of the Microsoft China
said that he is confident that Microsoft will win the case in the
end.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that Microsoft has filed an appeal to reverse the
District Court's decision.
</P>
<P>
There is a chance the government's case against Microsoft may
bypass the district's court and go straight to the Supreme Court.
But Liu said it is very unlikely that the Supreme Court will
directly deal with the case.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft China will continue its efforts to curb piracy in
China, saying that the company will take Yadu Science and
Technology Group to court again this year. The Yadu Group was
accused of using computer software developed and owned by
Microsoft and copying them from pirated discs. Microsoft, however,
lost the case last December.
</P>
<P>
"We are preparing for more legal actions," said Liu.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Host Asia's Largest Film, TV Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's film production is
expected to rise by 30 to 50 percent over last year as local
producers have more money to increase their output, according to
Raymond Wong, chairman of the Movie Producers and Distributors
Association of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference on the Hong Kong International
Film and TV Market (Filmart 2000) Tuesday, Wong attributed the
resurgence of Hong Kong's film industry to the efforts of the Hong
Kong SAR government on curbing piracy and the promotion of local
films on websites.
</P>
<P>
Crucindo Hung, chairman of the Hong Kong, Kowloon and New
Territories Motion Picture Industry Association, said new
investment from U.S. companies will also help to improve local
films.
</P>
<P>
"Their cooperation with Hong Kong film directors and famous
movie stars is a growing trend, creating more job opportunities
for local film companies," he added.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Hong Kong's film exports, Hung said the markets in
southeast Asia are recovering while audience in the United States
and Europe are becoming more interested in Hong Kong's big-budget
movies, which will be very popular in international markets.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the press conference, William Chui, deputy
senior manager of services promotion of the Trade Development
Council of Hong Kong, said the revival of Hong Kong's film
industry has been fueled by the gradual economic recovery in major
Hong Kong markets in southeast Asia and the injection of
investments from Internet companies in film promotion.
</P>
<P>
"The strong participation of Hong Kong companies in the
upcoming Filmart 2000 is a clear indication of such a revival. The
number of Hong Kong exhibitors joining the event increases by 62
percent to 39 over last year," he said, announcing that Filmart
2000 will be held from June 28 to 30 in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Launched in 1997, Filmart has developed into Asia's premier
film and TV market. It aims at promoting exports of films and TV
programs, which in turn strengthens Hong Kong's lead as an
international film and TV distribution hub.

<P>
JERUSALEM, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Israel's ultraorthodox religious
Shas party, which holds 17 seats in the 120-member parliament,
announced Tuesday afternoon that it would quit the coalition
government of Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
The party's policy-making Council of Torah Sages made the
decision after an urgent meeting in the morning, party leader Eli
Yishai said in a televised interview a short while ago.
</P>
<P>
Yishai, who is also the labor and social affairs minister, said
the Council's decision was final. "There will be no further
negotiations" with Barak over the coalition crisis, he added.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether the party will back down at the last
minute as it did several times before. Four Shas ministers will
submit their resignation on Sunday, but there are reports saying
the resignation will take effect in 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
Shas has been demanding millions of shekels to save its school
system from bankruptcy due to poor management over the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
Barak and Yishai met late Monday night for nearly two hours.
Barak reportedly asked the Shas leader to order his party to vote
against the early-election bill in further readings before meeting
Shas' demands. But Yishai said that he will not agree to Barak's
proposals if they do not secure a satisfactory deal first.
</P>
<P>
Shas' departure will upset Barak government's 68-52 majority in
the Knesset (parliament) to a 51-69 minority.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the other two rebellious Yisrael Ba'aliya and National
Religious Party, may follow Shas' suit steps to quit the coalition,
sealing the fate of the first-phase of Barak government.
</P>
<P>
All the three parties voted along with the oppositions last
Wednesday for a preliminary-reading bill calling for early
elections, setting off the coalition crisis.
</P>
<P>
Shas' uncompromising stance dashed Barak's hope to patch
together a similar mix to the current coalition. The prime minister
will therefore have to form a narrow coalition, which may need the
support of Arab parties for survival.
</P>
<P>
The coalition crisis is a blow to Barak, who is in dire need of
support for his peace-making with the Palestinians and Syria, as
the negotiations are at a delicate and critical stage.

The flexibilities are effected through amendments to the
relevant provisions in the SC's Policies and Guidelines on Issue/
Offer of Securities and Guidelines for Public Offerings of
Securities of Infrastructure Project Companies as well as Mesdaq's
Listing Rules.
</P>
<P>
The commission decided to allow the flexibilities in view of
improved economic conditions, it said, adding that in allowing the
flexibilities, the SC has taken into consideration factors such as
that investor protection and market integrity would not be
compromised as a result of the flexibilities, while the commission
itself is progressing towards a disclosure-based regulatory
framework.
</P>
<P>
Following the announcement, the SC introduced three principles:
</P>
<P>
First that a subsidiary/associated company of a holding company
listed on the KLSE or Mesdaq is not allowed to seek listing in
either one of the stock exchanges unless the listed holding
company has a separate autonomous business of its own, either
directly or through its other unlisted subsidiary/associated
companies, and is able to sustain its listing in the future.
</P>
<P>
Another is that a subsidiary/associated company of a holding
company listed on KLSE or Mesdaq is not allowed to seek listing on
either one of the exchanges if it was injected previously into the
listed holding company through a reverse take-over or back-door
listing. The same restriction applies to a business which had
previously obtained a direct listing.
</P>
<P>
The third is that a subsidiary/associated company of a holding
company listed on KLSE is not allowed to seek listing on KLSE if
it is a company which is required to fulfill the historical profit
track record requirement as stipulated under the Issues Guidelines
unless the listed parent company is able, on its own, to meet the
aggregate after-tax profit record test (but not necessarily the
uninterrupted profit record test and minimum profit level for the
most recent financial year) of the listing requirements as
stipulated under the Issues Guidelines.

<HEADLINE> Manila Working for Lasting Not Fleeting Peace: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Tuesday that peace remains its top priority for Mindanao, but
stressed that the peace it is pursuing should be just and enduring.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said in a radio speech that
the government will not tolerate a fleeting "peace" that gives
armed groups, such as the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) the
chance to regroup and mount offensives against the government.
</P>
<P>
"We have always been for peace. In fact, if possible we want
the hostilities to end," Zamora said. "Here we are the ones that
are being attacked ... We have to defend ourselves and the
communities we are duty bound to protect."
</P>
<P>
In a separate radio interview, presidential spokesman Ricardo
Puno added that it is better to work now for a lasting peace, than
to lull the people into a false sense of security.
</P>
<P>
He noted that past experiences with the MILF has shown that it
has taken advantages of the ceasefire to consolidate its forces
and fight the government.
</P>
<P>
"Our direction is towards truth and enduring peace. This peace
must be lasting, and not so short as to allow the MILF to regroup
and challenge the government anew," Puno said.
</P>
<P>
No sign is in sight for the end of the clashes between the
government troops and the MILF, that have lasted for more than a
month, though the two sides resumed peace talks at the beginning
of this month.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, military reports said heavy fighting broke out
again between government forces and some Muslim rebels in South
Cotabato, Mindanao in the morning.
</P>
<P>
The crossfire between the government troops and the MILF
members has wounded at least two people and displaced some 80
families living near the fighting site.

BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese universities and colleges
plan to enroll a total of 1.8 million students this year, up 12.5
percent over last year, according to the State Development
Planning Commission (SDPC).
</P>
<P>
The enlarged enrollment is expected to help stimulate consumer
enthusiasm and ease employment pressure, sector insiders said,
hoping that it can also promote the country's reform in the higher
education sector.
</P>
<P>
In order to delegate more decision-making power to universities,
the State Council, China's cabinet, has decided to allow
provincial governments to set their own annual enrollment plans
according to local situation and needs.
</P>
<P>
The SDPC has allocated the proceedings of four billion yuan of
treasury bonds for the enrollment program over the past two years.
</P>

Sources also predict that the actual number of college

<HEADLINE> Survey on China's Forest Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- China's forest acreage exceeded
159 million hectares and its forest storage 11.27 cubic meters,
ranking 5th and 7th in the world, respectively, according to
figures released today by the China State Forest Administration (
SFA).
</P>
<P>
The 5th national survey on China's forest resources also shows
that the country's forest coverage increased by 1.43 percentage
points over the 4th survey to 16.55 percent, with the forest
acreage growing more than 13 million hectares and forest storage
600 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The 5th survey covers the period from 1994 to 1998, and the 4th
was conducted between 1989 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
Despite the rise of forest resources in general, China's forest
work still has a lot of problems, including excess logging, rising
timber demands and illegally using forests for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that between 1994 to 1998, 2.81 million
hectares of forest was turned into non-forest land and more than
80 million cubic meters of forests were chopped against state
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
SFA Director Wang Zhibao said at a press conference here today
that China will adopt a series of measures to improve the
protection of forests, including establishing special institutions
to protect forests and the formulation of special state regulation
to punish officials involving in illegal logging.
</P>
<P>
China will also place more emphasis on developing forest for
commercial purposes while planting more trees.
</P>
<P>
China began national surveys on forest resources in the early
1970s. The 5th survey was based on investigations on 270,000
sample places in 30 provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities across the country.

<HEADLINE> China Will Not Rely On Imports To Meet Timber Demand: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- China has the capacity to produce
enough timber to meet domestic demand and will not rely on imports,
a senior Chinese forest official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhibao, director of State Forestry Administration, said at
a press conference that China has more than 260 million hectares
of forest. If ten percent is used to develop fast-growing trees
for commercial purposes, there will be no problem to meet the
demand for timber at home.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that China's timber demand is about 150 million
cubic meters a year. Supply on the international market, however,
is only around 120 million cubic meters. China must therefore
place special emphasis on developing fast-growing trees for
commercial use, he said, adding that if these trees can meet
domestic, illegal logging will be greatly reduced.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has mapped out strategies for developing its
forests by focusing on planting trees in China's western region
and improve commercial forest bases in the eastern region.

<HEADLINE> TB:Feature: People's Deputies at Grassroots Level(1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YIBIN, Sichuan Province, June 13 (Xinhua) -- 32-year-old Zhang
Pin serves as village Party chief and is busy running a brick and
tile mill.
</P>
<P>
But from this year on, he has to find two or three days a month
to visit his constituents in capacity of a deputy to his township
people's congress elected two years ago.
</P>
<P>
He is following the directive of people's congress of Gaoxian
County of Southwestern Sichuan Province to bring the role of
people's deputies to full play and exercise their constitutional
rights in full for the interests of the public.
</P>
<P>
As it happens, Gaoxian country is where chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress or top
legislator Li Peng's ancestral home lies and where he lived in his
tender age.
</P>
<P>
"People used to eye me as an official because I'm a village
Party chief," he said, noting that "when I approach them as a
people's deputy they elected, they take it for granted that I
should serve them, and we become rather close."
</P>
<P>
People's congresses in China have contributed enormously to the
rule of law movement, but the role of people's deputies to be
played when legislative session ends remain weak.
</P>
<P>
The people's deputies' visits to households to solicit opinions
have been a major creation of mountainous Gaoxian country to
counter the problem.
</P>
<P>
"I used to feel like a people's deputy when the annual
congressional session began," Zhang said, adding that "until
today, I always reminds myself I'm a people's deputy."

<HEADLINE> Feature: People's Deputies at Grassroots Level(2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In March and April, more than 1,000 people's deputies at
township levels, both directly elected, summarized 72 issues and
put forward to county government.
</P>
<P>
By May 25, all issues were resolved, and results and answers
were publicized for all to see.
</P>
<P>
According to a village billboard, one land management official
used to demand an extra fee of 30 yuan for each application for a
piece land for building a farm house. After people's deputies
filed the complaint, the county land management bureau ordered the
official to hand the money back, and to write a written apology
for his illegal conduct.
</P>
<P>
Another people's deputy told the government that a village
school was too poor and unsafe for children and had never been
paid attention to even if one of the deputy county heads and the
education bureau had been repeatedly warned. By now, the county
education bureau has agreed to allocate 7,000 yuan for the repair
of the school.
</P>
<P>
"The only ways for us to have our problems solved were seeking
help from officials or resorting to our personal connections, even
sometime illegal," said Yan Weigang, a villager of Qingfu town in
Gaoxian county.
</P>
<P>
"But today, people's deputies are also helpful," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 43-year-old farmer once confided with a people's deputy who
visited him that his farm and feedlot could not make his ends meet
because his two children in school cost too much. With the help
of the deputy, he got bank loans to expand his feedlot last year.
And today, his two-story building was newly equipped with a big-
sized color TV.

Liu Yongjiang, director of the county environment protection
bureau, said that people's deputies have proved to be a great help
to government work, in addition to being a watchdog.
</P>
<P>
"It is easier today for us to punish polluters, because they
know that people's deputies have also advocated us to do so," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The practices of grassroots people's congresses have become an
impetus for the development and improvement of China's fundamental
political system -- the people's congress system.
</P>
<P>
Assessing the work of government officials, judges and
prosecutors by people's deputies, and looking into judicial cases
for supervision have been creations of local people's congresses,
and have been affirmed as effective by top lawmaker Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
In a nearby Gongxian county, people's deputies created a new
practice that they deliver annual report to their constituents for
review.
</P>
<P>
"Because of this, no people's deputy has been found to have
breached the law or discipline in recent years," said Wang
Yuansheng, chairman of presidium of Xunchang township people's
congress of Gongxian.
</P>
<P>
"The creative practices of local people's congress is
propelling the wheel of China's legal construction and democratic
progress," said Shen Qingwu, vice-chairman of the Yibin Municipal
People's Congress Standing Committee, in an interview.

<HEADLINE> Sino-British HIV/AIDS Project Launched in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- China and Britain will jointly
implement an AIDS program in two Chinese provinces with an aim to
create a model of disease prevention, treatment and care for
people vulnerable to HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases (
STD).
</P>
<P>
Although the China-UK HIV/AIDS Prevention and Care Project will
mainly focus on the five-year try-out work in Yunnan and Sichuan,
two AIDS-stricken provinces in southwest China, the goal is to
create an effective national response to HIV/AIDS and to develop
the national policy framework, according to Wang Longde, Vice-
Minister of Health.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics of confirmed HIV infections in China were
18,143 at the end of March this year. But experts projected that
HIV/AIDS, emerging as a serious epidemic in China, the world's
most populous country, has affected at least 500,000 Chinese so
far.
</P>
<P>
Wang said at today's launching ceremony that the STD, a key
risky factor of the AIDS epidemic, also has became rampant.
</P>
<P>
"Real figure of STD cases may five or even ten times the
confirmed 836,600 cases in 1999," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to a Sino-British protocol signed on March, Britain's
Department for International Development will provide 15.3 million
pounds (22.95 million U.S. dollars) grant to China, making it the
biggest donation to China's anti-AIDS efforts.
</P>
<P>
"Given the fact that most carriers do not know they are
infected and so unintentionally may inject others, effective
interventions are needed now to stem this. We hope that the
project will make a significant contribution," Nigel Cox, the
Minister of the British Embassy in Beijing, said at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the project would be promoting condom use through
educational campaigns and innovative methods, and would help
relevant authorities track the disease more accurately by
improving surveillance systems.
</P>
<P>
"The project aims to reduce the public stigma attached to the
disease, and to make more people aware of the need for adequate
public spending on treatment and prophylaxis against opportunistic
infections commonly associated with AIDS," he added.

ZHENGZHOU, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Henan Province in Central China
plans to build 18 sewage treatment plants in some major cities in
the province.
</P>
<P>
With a total investment of 3.53 billion yuan (425.66 million U.
S. dollars), these plants are capable of treating 1.99 million
tons of waste water every day, a senior official from Henan
Provincial Planning Committee said today.
</P>
<P>
Today construction of 14 of the 18 plants is underway, while
that of the remaining four is expected to begin later this year.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that 10 plants, scattered in Zhengzhou, the
capital of the province, Luoyang, Xuchang and other six major
cities, are expected to be completed and operational by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River and the Huaihe River flow through the province,
but they have been badly polluted in recent years by waste water
from major cities in the province.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the province produced 1.1 billion tons of waste water.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's GNP Estimated to Increase in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's 1999 Gross National
Product (GNP) was estimated at 1,259.5 billion HK dollars (161.6
billion U.S. dollars) at current market prices, representing a
decline of 2.8 percent from 1998, according to the Census and
Statistics Department of Hong Kong Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But after netting out the effect of price change, Hong Kong's
GNP grew by 2.9 percent in real terms in 1999, in contrast to a 3.
7 percent decline in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The difference of 27.3 billion HK dollars (3.5 billion U.S.
dollars) from the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the same year,
which was estimated at 1,232.2 billion HK dollars (158.1 billion U.
S. dollars), represented a net factor income inflow equivalent to
2.2 percent of GDP in the year.
</P>
<P>
Total factor income inflow into Hong Kong, estimated at 366.9
billion HK dollars (47 billion U.S. dollars), reverted to a 1.2
percent increase in 1999, in stark contrast to a 22.7 percent
decline in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Total factor income outflow likewise recovered, rising by 1.7
percent over 1998 to 339.6 billion HK dollars (43.5 billion U.S.
dollars) in 1999. This also represented a distinct turnaround from
the 27.2 percent fall in 1998.
</P>
<P>
A government secretariat spokesman pointed out that the
turnaround of both external factor income inflow and outflow to
positive growth in 1999 was driven by improvement in both the
local and regional economic environment thereby yielding better
investment returns.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman further pointed out that, in tandem with the pick-
up in GDP, GNP also regained growth in real terms, signifying the
economic recovery in progress in 1999.

<HEADLINE> HK Public Shows Less Concern over Labor, Economy Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Public concerns over labor and
economy related problems have both decreased by six percent in the
latest bimonthly opinion survey conducted by the Home Affairs
Bureau (HAB) of Hong Kong, but these two remain the most often
mentioned problems by respondents.
</P>
<P>
Labor-related problems were mentioned by 39 percent of the
respondents. Among this group, 91 percent cited difficulty in
finding jobs, layoffs and underemployment as their main concerns.
</P>
<P>
Economy-related problems, mentioned by 34 percent of the
respondents, ranked the second. Of them, 56 percent were concerned
about the current employment situation or underemployment.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of respondents mentioning environmental
protection related-problems has increased from nine percent in
March to 26 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman with HAB said: "While Hong Kong's economy is
recovering well with a GDP growth of 14 percent in the first
quarter, there are certain sectors of the community who have not
yet benefited from the economic recovery such as those who are
unemployed and those with low income."
</P>
<P>
The government has been taking positive steps to help those who
are affected by economic restructuring, and is also determined to
tackle the environment-related problems, he added.
</P>
<P>
The survey, 88th in a series, was the result of 1,674
interviews successfully conducted over the telephone in May. The
interviewees, aged 15 to 64, were chosen by random through the
residential telephone directories.

<HEADLINE> (Recast) Survey on China's Forest Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- China's forest acreage exceeded
159 million hectares and its forest storage 11.27 billion cubic
meters, ranking 5th and 7th in the world, respectively, according
to figures released today by the China State Forest Administration
(SFA).
</P>
<P>
The 5th national survey on China's forest resources also shows
that the country's forest coverage increased by 1.43 percentage
points over the 4th survey to 16.55 percent, with the forest
acreage growing more than 13 million hectares and forest storage
600 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The 5th survey covers the period from 1994 to 1998, and the 4th
was conducted between 1989 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
Despite the rise of forest resources in general, China's forest
work still has a lot of problems, including excess logging, rising
timber demands and illegally using forests for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that between 1994 to 1998, 2.81 million
hectares of forest was turned into non-forest land and more than
80 million cubic meters of forests were chopped against state
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
SFA Director Wang Zhibao said at a press conference here today
that China will adopt a series of measures to improve the
protection of forests, including establishing special institutions
to protect forests and the formulation of special state regulation
to punish officials involving in illegal logging.
</P>
<P>
China will also place more emphasis on developing forest for
commercial purposes while planting more trees.
</P>
<P>
China began national surveys on forest resources in the early
1970s. The 5th survey was based on investigations on 270,000
sample places in 30 provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities across the country.

<HEADLINE> Cancer-Succumbed Thai Politician Warns Against Smoking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 13 (Xinhua) -- A veteran Thai politician, who
died of lung cancer Monday evening, warned the public not to smoke
in his last message to them, Thailand News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Montri Pongpanich was the leader of the Social Action Party for
almost a decade, and served as a cabinet member for 11 times.
</P>
<P>
Montri sent the message to the public after realizing that his
lung cancer was caused by his long-time smoking.
</P>
<P>
In the message, he said that Thai people should realize the
danger of smoking, and avoid or reduce and eventually stop smoking
before it was too late.
</P>
<P>
Montri underwent surgery in 1998 to remove part of his right
lung following the discovery that he had second-stage cancer.
</P>
<P>
Doctors began giving him radiation treatments in February last
year when they found that the cancer had returned.
</P>
<P>
Montri resigned his party leadership and industry minister post
in late 1998 because of poor health. His party, in disarray after
his departure, pulled out of the current coalition government last
year.

<HEADLINE> Communication Lines With Abu Sayyaf to Be Kept Open: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will keep
the lines of communication open with the extremist Abu Sayyaf,
which holds 21 hostages in Sulu, during the present "cooling off"
period, an official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora made this clear in a radio
speech Tuesday, belying the reports that the government has
suspended negotiations with the hostage takers.
</P>
<P>
According to Zamora, the "cooling off" period refers to the
next three-to-four-day break for the government to take to review
the progress of the negotiations for the captives' release and
study the new conditions set by the kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
"The cabinet Cluster E is just reviewing the Abu Sayyaf's
demands. The word 'suspension' should not even been used. We are
telling them that we need to review, we are taking a little time
out. This is only three to four days," Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet Cluster E, the body tasked to tackle political
affairs and national security concerns, decided that in view of
the Abu Sayyaf's changing conditions set for the negotiation, the
government should take time to analyze them and come up with a
clear stand before returning to the negotiating table, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zamora also said that no decision has been made to replace
Secretary Robert Aventajado, the presidential flagship projects
committee chairman, as chief of the government panel tasked to
secure the hostages' release.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf has reportedly sought Aventajado's replacement
as chief government negotiator.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Apologizes Over Fuel Price Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
has apologized for not consulting widely enough on the recent 50
percent increase in prices of petroleum products, local media
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Information Minister Jerry Gana was quoted as saying
in the capital Abuja on Monday that the president wishes to
apologize to the Nigeria Labor Congress for not consulting enough
before the price increase.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the president, Gana said the president
wanted to avoid further delay for the implementation of his
programs.
</P>
<P>
Gana said the government has made mistakes over the fuel price
issue. " Please accept our apologies," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government's decision to raise the prices of the petroleum
products by 50 percent from June 1 has led to a nationwide strike
by the Nigeria Labor Congress, which paralyzed the country for the
past five days.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the government and the labor have reached
an agreement over the fuel prices and the nationwide strike will
be ended on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Links Support for Nigeria's Debt Relief to IMF Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will secure a helping hand
from the United States in its drive for debt relief only if the
country adopts the stringent economic policies of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, visiting
U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said in Abuja Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper, Tuesday quoted
Summers as saying that the U.S. was committed to Nigeria's drive
for debt pardon, noting that his government only recently
initiated talks with the Paris Club to work out aid programs for
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
In response, Nigeria's Vice President Atiku Abubakar told him
that Nigeria was committed to pushing ahead with its economic
reform policies.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. had faith in the Obasanjo administration,
adding: "The commitment to eradicate corruption is very
encouraging ... that is why we say we will go along with you on
the issue of debt reschedulement provided there is significant
economic reform."
</P>
<P>
Summers had earlier conferred with President Olusegun Obasanjo,
Central Bank Governor (CBN) Chief Joseph Sanusi and Finance
Minister Alhaji Ciroma on issues of economic development strategy
for Nigeria, appropriate financial environment and the debt
burden.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has been campaigning for relief from its crippling
debt, reportedly worth some 30 billion U. S. dollar, with the
government warning that it could hamper its capacity to improve
the welfare of the people and to deliver the benefits of
democracy.
</P>
<P>
On President Bill Clinton's proposed visit to Nigeria, Summers
said an acceptable date was yet to be worked out but noted that
discussions had been stepped up in this regard, adding:"We are
still positive on the visit."
</P>
<P>
He, however, denied that the delay in the visit had anything to
do with recent socio-political upheavals in Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> Cargo Handling Up by 49 Percent at Luanda Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Luanda Commercial Port in
Angola handled about 500,000 tons of goods in the first three
months of the year, an increase of 49 percent over the same period
of last year.
</P>
<P>
The figure was released here Tuesday by the Angolan council of
ministers, which said that the Luanda port handled 85 percent of
the goods entering Angola in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
During the period, there were 11,790 containers discharged and
12,320 containers embarked in the port, the council said.
</P>
<P>
The Luanda Commercial Port, one of the most famous ports along
the western coastline of the African continent, covers an area of
620,000 square meters and has a 2,770-meter dock.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that the growth of the cargo volume in the
port is mainly due to the relatively stable political and military
situation in the war-torn country, where the government has gained
advantage in the battlefield at the turn of the year.

<HEADLINE> Wrap-Up: Chinese FM Spokesman's Remarks at Press Conference(1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- China welcomes and supports the
first ever inter-Korean summit in more than 50 years, Foreign
Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu told a press conference that China hopes the summit will
yield positive results so as to contribute to the further
improvement of relations between the two sides of the Korean
Peninsula as well as peace and stability there.
</P>
<P>
The summit is "a major event" in the development of the
situation in the peninsula, and should be considered as "a good
thing", he said, adding that China will continue to play a
constructive role in maintaining peace and stability in the
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
With regard to a report that the US government will send
Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater to attend the 24th joint
meeting of the US-Taiwan Business Council, and sell to Taiwan
electronic countermeasures and navigation equipment for F-16
fighters, Zhu said that China has urged the United States to
observe the one-China principle and put an end to arms sales to
Taiwan and any exchange or contact of an official nature with
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The erroneous acts of the US government have seriously violated
the three China-US joint communiques and infringed upon China's
sovereignty, he said, adding that the Chinese government has made
solemn representations with the US government to express its
strong displeasure and firm opposition.

When asked to comment on the situation in South Pacific, Zhu
said China is concerned about the situation in the Solomon Islands
and Fiji.
</P>
<P>
He said China hopes all parties concerned in the Solomon
Islands will work together to normalize and stabilize the
situation as soon as possible through dialog and consultations.
</P>
<P>
"We also hope that all parties concerned in Fiji will work
together to seek a proper solution, in order to normalize and
stabilize the situation as soon as possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government has tried to do everything to
ensure the safety of Chinese emigrants in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the Taiwan question is totally different from the
German or Korean issue and can only be resolved within the one-
China framework, adding that it is purely an internal affair of
China, and it is completely different, both in terms of root
causes and nature, from the German or the Korean question, so they
cannot be put on a par.
</P>
<P>
Although the two sides across the Taiwan Straits are yet to be
reunified, the territory and sovereignty remain undivided and they
are still one China, he said, pointing out that the Chinese
government has adhered to the one-China principle and opposed
applying the German or Korean approach to resolving the Taiwan
question.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also announced that Chinese Vice-Premier Wen
Jiabao will lead a Chinese government delegation to attend the
World Summit of Social Development and Beyond to be held in Geneva,
Switzerland, from June 26 to 30.
</P>
<P>
Wen will also pay a visit to Britain and Switzerland.

<HEADLINE> HK's GDP to Grow by 6.8 Pct in 2000, PECC Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is expected to have a
real GDP growth of 6.8 percent this year, marking the end of a
rare deflationary cycle in the region's history, an official of
Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC) said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a PECC report on Pacific economic outlook forecast
at a press conference Tuesday, George Leung, member of the Hong
Kong Committee for Pacific Economic Cooperation, said that the
forecast of PECC also showed a slower growth in 2001 with real GDP
growth of 4.7 percent due to the interest rate hikes in 2000 and
higher base for comparison.
</P>
<P>
PECC attributed Hong Kong's high growth rate in 2000 to picking
up of domestic demand, strong growth of external trade and the
revival of domestic consumption spurred by better employment
prospects.
</P>
<P>
Leung, also chief economist of the Hong Kong HSBC Corporation
Ltd., said broad-based recovery will be seen in 2000 as domestic
demand picks up and external trade maintains its strong growth
momentum.
</P>
<P>
Leung said that 2000 should mark the end of a rare deflationary
cycle in Hong Kong's economic history, with deflation forecast to
lessen to 2.2 percent due to reviving domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
"One development that could affect Hong Kong's economic
prospects for 2000-2001 is a more aggressive tightening of U.S.
monetary policy, as Hong Kong is forced to follow the U.S. actions
by the present fixed exchange rate arrangement," Leung cautioned.
</P>
<P>
And a significant slowdown in the U.S. economy would also have
an adverse impact on Hong Kong's export growth, he added.
</P>
<P>
From 2001 on, Leung concluded, the effects of the East Asian
crisis will finally dissipate and the economy will revert to its
normal growth cycle, with the effects of China's accession to the
WTO taking over as the prime factor in determining domestic growth.

<HEADLINE> PECC Foresees Faster Growth of Chinese Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Pacific Economic Cooperation
Council (PECC) expected the Chinese economy to grow by 7.3 percent
this year and by 7.6 percent in 2001, according to a report
released by the organization Tuesday in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
PECC predicted that consumption will lead the higher growth in
2000, with a 9 percent increase in total retail sales of consumer
goods and a 7.4 percent growth in total consumption.
</P>
<P>
Total investment in fixed assets, which was formerly a strong
engine driving china's economy, is expected to increase by 8.6
percent as the Chinese government will continue debt financing to
encourage investment in this area.
</P>
<P>
Foreign direct investment may increase even faster, reaching 12
percent growth, with resolution of the uncertainty about China's
entry into the World Trade Organization, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The improved world economy is expected to provide the momentum
for export growth of 12 percent in 2000, compared with 6.1 percent
in 1999 while imports are forecast to grow by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out the consumer price index of China has
finished its descent and will rise slightly in 2000 as sources of
demand continue to rise.
</P>
<P>
The PECC described the economic performance of China in 1999 as
"satisfactory."
</P>
<P>
With the recovery of the East Asian economy and concerted
government effort, China's economy continued to grow at a steady
speed in 1999, with gross domestic product increasing by 7.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
This marked the slowest growth since 1992, but given world and
regional growth, it was remarkable, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: PEO Economies Forecast to Further Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are 20 PEO economies, namely, Australia, Canada, Chile,
China, Colombia, Ecuador, China's Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan,
South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Philippines,
Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Slower growth in the United Sates, at 4.1 percent and 2.7
percent in 2000 and 2001, respectively, is salient among the
forecasts made in the report.
</P>
<P>
East Asia as a whole will have substantially stronger
performance in 2000 than over the past year, before easing a
little in 2001 as the exceptional opportunities of a recovery
period are exhausted.
</P>
<P>
PEO Latin America will be much stronger in 2000, before also
easing somewhat in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Japan is expected to have by far the slowest growth in the PEO
economies in both 2000 and 2001, at 1.2 percent and 2.1 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, these numbers are not particularly low for
contemporary Japan, because it is not reasonable to expect average
rates of growth above this range over the foreseeable futures, as
demographic factors limit the contribution of growth in labor
supply, said the report.
</P>
<P>
China is predicted to post the biggest growth in 2000 and 2001,
with 7.3 percent and 7.6 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The spectacular growth rates in recovery from recession in Hong
Kong and South Korea will ease to more sustainable levels in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Australia and Canada are expected to ease moderately, and less
than the United states.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's growth will accelerate in 2000 and remain strong in
2001, despite the easing in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The PECC forecasters expect strong growth throughout the PEO
economies to be associated with an acceleration of inflation in
each of 2000 and 2001 to weighted averages of 2.3 percent and 2.5
percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
These are still not high levels, even in the second year.
However, they will require a policy response to control continued
acceleration beyond the forecast period, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The deflation that has been experienced over the past couple of
years in China, Hong Kong and Japan will cease this year in China,
and be at a negligible level next year in Japan.
</P>
<P>
The PECC was founded in 1980 to serve as a forum to discuss
cooperation and policy coordination in areas that would promote
economic growth and development in the Pacific region.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Israel's Government Crisis Enters Critical Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Israel's government crisis
Tuesday enters the moment of truth as Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
the major rebellious ruling partner Shas are expected to make
critical decisions respectively.
</P>
<P>
The crisis began last Wednesday when six ministers in Barak's
cabinet, from Shas, Yisrael Ba'aliya and National Religious Party
(NRP), voted along the oppositions for a bill calling for
dissolving the 15th Knesset (Parliament) and holding early
elections.
</P>
<P>
According to Amendment 11 of Israel's Transition Law, the prime
minister has seven days to judge if such votes constituted a breach
of government's collective trust and a resignation announcement de
facto.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Barak should decide by Wednesday afternoon whether to make
good on his early threat to fire these ministers or to forget the
whole event and include the rebellious ruling partners in a
reshuffled coalition.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ultra-Orthodox religious Shas party, which holds
the pivotal 17 seats in the 120-member Knesset, will convene its
policy-making Council of Torah Sages on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The topic of discussions in the council meeting was not
disclosed, but Israel Radio reported Monday night that the sage's
panel will recommend the party to quit the government once and for
all.
</P>
<P>
In a televised interview last Wednesday, Barak suggested that he
will form a new coalition in a matter of days, excluding those
disloyal ministers. However, he backtracked later to prefer a
government similar to the current one over a narrow-majority
government without the three parties.
</P>
<P>
The weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday, at which Barak promised to
take decisive steps to form a new-style coalition, failed to make a
decision on the government crisis issue, partly because of the
sudden death of Syrian President Hafez al-Assad during the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Since then, officials from Barak's One Israel faction and Shas
continued negotiations to resolve their disputes over government
funding to Shas' religious educational network, which is the
behind-the-scene drive for the party's rebellious acts.
</P>
<P>
Shas has been demanding millions of shekels to save its school
system from bankruptcy due to poor management over the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
Barak and Shas leader Eli Yishai met late Monday night for
nearly two hours, but they failed to solve the problem and a
planned announcement of a new coalition agreement was aborted.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Barak reportedly asked the Shas leader to
order his party to vote against the early-election bill in further
readings before meeting Shas' demands. But Yishai said that he will
not agree to Barak's proposals if they do not secure a satisfactory
deal first.
</P>
<P>
The crisis with Shas deteriorated dramatically on Monday when
Health Minister Shlomo Benizri, another Shas leader, accused the
secular Meretz party of using the same tactics and the same hatred
toward Shas that the Nazis had used toward the Jews.
</P>
<P>
The left-wing Meretz is the archrival of Shas in the coalition
and its leader Yossi Sarid, who holds the education portfolio,
firmly opposed Barak's cave-in to Shas' financial demands for its
schools.
</P>
<P>
Although Barak issued a statement to condemn Benizri's remarks
and the bigmouth minister apologized in the Knesset later Monday
night, the incident shows Shas' frustration and impatience toward
the stagnant negotiations with the coalition, a dangerous signal to
Barak.
</P>
<P>
The clash with Shas is the major problem Barak faces, but
Yisrael Ba'aliya and NRP, the other two coalition rebels, also
expressed their intolerance toward the operation of the current
government.
</P>
<P>
Yisrael Ba'aliya leader and Interior Minister Natan Sharansky
blamed Barak for keeping secret his maneuver regarding the peace
talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"Instead of grouping ministers and working together for the
achievement of mutual aims, the current government consists of only
one person, the prime minister himself," Sharansky said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators resumed their talks on
Tuesday at an undisclosed location near Washington, aiming to reach
a framework agreement and a final peace accord by September.
</P>
<P>
The NRP had been openly against further concessions to the
Palestinians at this stage. The party had decided to leave Barak's
government once the transfer of three Arab villages near Jerusalem
to full Palestinian control is carried out.
</P>
<P>
Hence it seems that Barak's tactic to keep his current coalition
intact may be impractical. If the talks with Shas, Yisrael Ba'aliya
and NRP failed to produce positive results by Wednesday, Barak may
have to form a minority government with several other parties in
the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Another option is to form a national unity government with the
major opposition Likud party, which is favored by majority Israelis
in a Gallup poll published on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll, 57.6 percent interviewees prefer a
national unity government with Likud and without the religious
parties, while 34.9 percent were against it.
</P>
<P>
Among those supported Barak in last year's general elections,
67.5 percent responded in favor of the national unity option.
</P>
<P>
However, Likud leader Ariel Sharon had repeatedly clarified that
he will not associate his party with Barak's One Israel in a
government and will continue his efforts to advance early
elections. There is no sign that he will change his stands soon.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Economic Survey for
1999-2000 fiscal year ending on June 30, 2000, shows a GDP growth
rate of 4.5 percent against the target of 5 percent, a local
newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey to be released on June 15, the
achievement of 4.5 percent GDP growth was mainly thanks to the
better performance of the agricultural sector, which grew by 4.3
percent in 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
The country's economy was projected to grow by 5 percent in
1999-200, comprising 4.3 percent growth in agriculture, 5.5
percent in industry and 5.1 percent in other sectors, said the

<HEADLINE> International Fair on Low-Cost Housing to be Held in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- An international exhibition on the
material industry for low-cost housing in developing countries is
to be held in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, between June 30 and July 9
this year.
</P>
<P>
Jointly sponsored by the Common Market for Eastern and Southern
Africa (COMESA), the Indian government and the United Nations
Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO ), the exhibition will
be attended by policy makers, governments, private agencies and
professionals engaged in housing programs, according to a
statement from the COMESA center in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka-based newspaper The Post Tuesday quoted the
statement as saying that the proposed event will promote
international cooperation between COMESA member states and other
African countries for the transfer and sharing of manufacturing
technologies of composite materials appropriate for housing.
</P>
<P>
The event will also provide an opportunity for stakeholders
from the COMESA member states to exchange their experiences with
their counterparts.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the changing demographic and
migratory trends in developing countries are exerting pressure on
the domestic construction industry for improving efficiency,
productivity and delivery systems to meet housing needs for
citizens in the low-income strata.
</P>
<P>
It indicated that due to the severe shortage of building
materials, housing has become unaffordable to large segments of
the population in low income brackets.

<P>
LUSAKA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Political instability in Zimbabwe
and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) will weigh down
Zambia's economic recovery, according to a leading regional bank.
</P>
<P>
The weekly newspaper Financial Mail Tuesday quoted Standard
Chartered Bank as saying that Zambia's economy heavily depends on
copper exports and it may be unable to achieve its targeted GDP
growth rate this year because of the contagion effects of the
political troubles in its two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
"The main downside risks are external. There is a real risk of
contagion from the Zimbabwean situation and uneasy truce in the
DRC," the bank.
</P>
<P>
The bank cited the recent gradual downslide in the value of
Zambia's currency, Kwacha, against major world currencies as part
evidence of the negative impact placed on Zambia's economy.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia National Farmers Union (ZNFU) has sided with the
bank, saying that the political instability has a negative impact
on Zambia's economy.
</P>
<P>
ZNFU executive director Songowayo Zyambo said it is difficult
for Zambia to conduct business with the two neighboring countries
when the situation is so instable there.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Leader Hopes Future Talks Can Resolve Pending Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Kim Jong Il, leader of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), said Tuesday that
his first meeting with South Korean President Kim Dae-jung has set
up a good precedence which will serve as future references in
settling all unresolved issues between the North and South.
</P>
<P>
Kim Jong Il made the remarks during his first brief meeting,
which lasted for 27 minutes Tuesday afternoon, with visiting South
Korean President Kim Dae-jung at the Paekhwawon State Guest House
in Pyongyang, according to pool reports from the Korean Press
Corps.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK leader told Kim Dae-jung that the North side has made
careful preparations for the welcoming ceremony for President Kim,
adding that the people of Pyongyang are informed of the routes of
President Kim Dae-jung's motorcade.
</P>
<P>
Kim Jong Il went to the airport to greet President Kim upon his
arrival at the Sun'an Airport in Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
He said that the people of the North "whole-heartedly welcome
President Kim Dae-jung's visit." Describing Kim Dae-jung's visit
as a "brave act," Kim Jong Il said "we are of the same Chosun (
Korea) people." The people of the North "have no reason not to
welcome President Kim Dae-jung's visit."
</P>
<P>
An estimated 600,000 people lined the 10 kilometer-route from
Sun'an Airport to the State Guest House to greet President Kim Dae-
jung and his entourage.
</P>
<P>
"The day of June 13 will go down in history for ever," Kim
Jong Il said.
</P>
<P>
Kim Dae-jung said in reply, "From now on, let's make history
together."
</P>
<P>
The South Korean president said he felt strong emotions at the
warm welcome scenes earlier in the day and expressed his "whole-
hearted appreciation" to Kim Jong Il and his people. He also said
that Kim Jong Il's presence at the airport indeed gave him a touch
of "the North's sincerity."

<HEADLINE> Desalinating Sea Water to Ease Water Shortage: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 14 (Xinhua) -- China should step up
industrialization of sea water desalination efforts to ease water
shortage, an expert here suggest.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the 13 countries with most severe water
shortage in the world, with per capita water resources at only 2,
400 cubic meters or one fourth of the world average.
</P>
<P>
The water shortage is even more serious in its coastal areas,
with water resources in some industrial cities averaging only 500
cu m per person, said Ruan Guoling, a senior engineer at the
Research Institute for Sea Water Desalination and Comprehensive
Use under the State Oceanic Administration.
</P>
<P>
Ruan said that in those cities it is of great importance to
develop sea water desalination to meet increasing demand for water.
</P>
<P>
China started research in sea water desalination in the 1950s.
Coastal regions like Dalian, Shandong and Tianjin have been the
first to develop the technology.
</P>
<P>
The country's largest sea water desalination plant is in
Changhai County in Liaodong Peninsula, Liaoning Province in
northeast China. On Dachangshan Island where the county seat is
located, per capita freshwater resources amount to only 465 cubic
meters.
</P>
<P>
With a desalination capacity of 1,000 cubic meters per day, the
plant helped local residents pass the hardest period when a
drought hit the county last year, drying up all the reservoirs and
ponds there, said Wang Zhenmin, the county's water resources
official.
</P>
<P>
Water shortage appeared in some Chinese cities as early as the
1960s, and more than 300 cities were short of water in the early
1990s. Now, some 100 cities cannot even supply enough water for
daily use of their 40 million residents, said Ruan the senior
engineer.
</P>
<P>
Water shortage will be a big threat to China's sustainable
development in the long run. By 2030 China's population is
expected to reach 1.6 billion, and per capita freshwater resources
will reduce to around 1,700 cubic meters.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Issue Cannot Follow German or Korean Model, FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Taiwan question is totally
different from the German or Korean issue and can only be resolved
within the one-China framework, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman
Zhu Bangzao said here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a regular press conference, Zhu said: "The question
of Taiwan is purely an internal affair of China. It is completely
different, both in terms of root causes and nature, from the
German or the Korean question, so they cannot be put on a par."
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that the Taiwan question is one left over from China'
s civil war and to find a solution to the Taiwan question is China
's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that it is universally recognized by the
international community that there is only one China in the world
and Taiwan is an inseparable part of the Chinese territory. The
government of the People's Republic of China is the sole
legitimate government representing the whole of China, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is exactly on this basis that most of the countries in the
world have established diplomatic relations with the People's
Republic of China," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that although the two sides across the
Taiwan Straits are yet to be reunited, the territory and
sovereignty remain undivided and they are still one China.
</P>
<P>
It is totally different from the fact that the former East
Germany and West Germany were, and the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea are, all sovereign
states universally recognized by the international community, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Zhu stated that the question of Taiwan can only be resolved
with in the one-China framework. "The Chinese government has all
along adhered to the 'one China' principle and always opposed
applying the German or Korean approach to resolving the Taiwan
question," he said.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the Taiwan authorities in applying the German
model or the Korean model to handling cross-strait relations is to
resist reunification, he indicated.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the Taiwan authorities will have a clear
understanding of the situation, give up their separatist
standpoints, and accept the 'one China' principle in explicit
terms and as soon as possible," he said.

<HEADLINE> Khatami to Reshuffle Cabinet, Daily Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 13 (Xinhua) -- President Mohammad Khatami will make
a big reshuffle in his cabinet by changing at least eight ministers
and vice presidents, the pro-reformist newspaper Iran Daily
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The reported move comes in the wake of the formation of a
parliament dominated by the president's reformist allies.
</P>
<P>
Although there is no official confirmation of possible changes,
it is rumored that some cabinet members may not retain their
ministerial posts while some others will change their posts, the
daily said.
</P>
<P>
First Vice President Hassan Habibi, who functions as prime
minister, will be replaced by Mohammad Ali Najafi, vice president
and chairman of the Plan and Budget Organization (PBO), the daily
said. Habibi, who had served in his post for more than a decade,
reportedly intends to retire.
</P>
<P>
The post of PBO head will be taken by Mohammad Reza Aref,
current minister of post, telegraph and telephone while his deputy
Davoodi Shamsi will take his place, it said.
</P>
<P>
Mohsen Rezaie, current secretary of the powerful advisory State
Expediency Council headed by former President Hashemi Rafsanjani,
will be a possible replacement of Mohammad Hashemi, Rafsanjani's
brother, to be the vice president for executive affairs.
</P>
<P>
The reformists, victorious in the February parliamentary
elections, dislike Hashemi, who had slammed the reformists for
their opposition to Rafsanjani's participation in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani secured a seat in the new parliament, but later
quitted as his bid for parliament speakership appeared gloomy.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani will become interior minister to
succeed Abdolvahed Musavi Lari, who will go to the Ministry of
Culture and Islamic Guidance to take the place of Ataollah
Mohajerani, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani, an advocate for freedom of press and expression, has
come under fierce attack by the conservatives, who still control
most of the power state organs.
</P>
<P>
Iran Daily said the embattled Mohajerani will take the post of
education minister while Minister of Economic and Financial Affairs
Hossein Namazi will be replaced by Hossein Kazempour Ardebili,
currently deputy oil minister.
</P>
<P>
Since the February elections in which reformists upset
conservative dominance of the parliament, Khatami has been pushed
by his allies to make major changes in his cabinet to remove those
who were not fully committed to reforms.
</P>
<P>
The current cabinet, formed in August 1997, is a coalition of
the reformist party of Islamic Iran Participation Front (IIPF), the
pro-Rafsanjani centrist Party of Constructive Executives of Iran
(PCEI) and the leftist Assembly of Combatant Clergy (ACC) headed by
the new parliament Speaker Mehdi Karrubi.
</P>
<P>
But relations between the Khatami's reformists and Rafsanjani's
centrists soured before the February elections over whether
Rafsanjani should run for a parliament seat and ultimately the
speakership.

<HEADLINE> Pak, U.S. to Resume Dialogue on Nuclear, Security Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and the United States
will resume dialogue on nuclear and security issues on June 15
when Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar is due to meet Deputy Secretary
of State Strobe Talbott in Washington, said a statement issued
here Tuesday by the Foreign Office of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"The Government (of Pakistan) welcomes the resumption of
dialogue with the U.S., because it represents an important effort
for preventing a nuclear arms race and arms buildup in South Asia,
where the security climate continues to remain tense on account of
the unresolved Jammu and Kashmir dispute," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It said the resumed dialogue will enable the two sides to
review their positions on the five benchmarks, which are matters
of vital importance for peace, stability and security of the
region.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan pursues a policy of responsibility and restraint on
nuclear issues," it said, adding this has been emphasized by Chief
Executive General Pervez Musharraf publicly on several occasions.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the government has instituted
stringent measures to enhance custodial controls and safeguards.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has proposed to India a strategic restraint regime for
avoidance of arms race, nuclear or conventional, and confidence
building in the region. "We are willing to consider any restraint
arrangements on a reciprocal basis with India," the Foreign Office
said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing Pakistan does not permit export of nuclear technology
and materials, the statement noted that the government's stance on
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is a continuation of Pakistan's
established policy of support for a universal and non-
discriminatory veritable commitment to renunciation of nuclear
weapons test explosions.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Military (TNI)
insisted here Tuesday that Papua issue is an internal affair of
the Indonesian government and explicitly voiced its position of
not allowing any interventions of external forces in the issue.
</P>
<P>
"Our stance is clear that Irian Jaya province (Papua) is still
a part of the unitary state of Indonesia," TNI Chief Adm. Widodo
said in a hearing with the House of Representatives (DPR)
Commission I on defense, security and foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
"We have to solve the problem and should take necessary
measures to prevent (such a problem) from spreading. The Irian
Jaya problem has to be solved by our own nation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the declaration of independence of Papua issued
at the "Papua National Congress" last week could be considered as
a separatist movement.
</P>
<P>
"And based on national and international laws, such a move
could be dealt with by stern measures. But we give priority to
persuasive approaches," the TNI chief said.
</P>
<P>
"Our policy in dealing with separatist movements in Papua is
based on the government's policies," he added.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Chief of the National Police (Polri) Gen.
Rusdihardjo said that the police have been investigating against
those who are involved in "Papua National Congress."
</P>
<P>
"If we find evidences, we will take legal action against those
who are suspected to have been responsible for the declaration of
independence in Papua," Rusdihardjo said.
</P>
<P>
The one-week-long "Papua National Congress" which was attended
by about 3000 representatives from 14 districts in the province
declared on June 4 that the province would no longer be a part of
the unitary state of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
President Wahid has warned security forces in Papua not to
resort to violence in an effort to quash separatism in the
province.

<HEADLINE> Former Residence Rebuilt to Honor China's First Private Banker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Lei Lutai, an apprentice turned
businessman, established the first embryonic form of private bank
in China some 180 years ago. He earned a huge sum of money for his
boss and a lasting fame for himself.
</P>
<P>
His former residence in Pingyao County, north China's Shanxi
Province, has been recently renovated and opened to the public.
</P>
<P>
In 1823, Lei suggested that his boss, a big dealer in dyestuff,
turn his business into a specialized Piaohao, an exchange house
that handles remittances and bills.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1823, Rishengchang, meaning rising like the sun, was
the first specialized Piaohao in China, and Lei was its first
manager. Under Lei's careful operation, it soon had branches in
various parts of the country, and its business expanded to taking
deposits and making loans.
</P>
<P>
After Rishengchang, scores of other Piaohao appeared and boomed
in the following years, serving the needs of industrial and
commercial businesses. In the early 20th century the Piaohao was
replaced by modern banks and faded away.
</P>
<P>
According to specialists, Lei's former residence and the nearby
former site of Rishengchang Piaohao, both well preserved, are very
important in studying the history of banking and architecture in
China.

<P>
XI'AN, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Two nestlings dropping out of the
nest has led to the discovery of a habitat of black storks in the
northern part of this northwest China Province.
</P>
<P>
A farmer in Caihe Village, Yaoxian County, came across the baby
birds in a river side and reported to the local wild animal
protection department.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the provincial wild animal research institute

black storks, a wild animal in the state first-class protection
list.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time black storks are found in Shaanxi since
1956, said the experts, adding that black storks are migrant birds
which live in northeast and north China, the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region and Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
Local villagers said that black storks came to this northern
Shaanxi village only two years ago. There are about 20 coming
there this year.

will further promote its China business and support the
development of the country's own engines and automobiles.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Assad's State Funeral Underway in Damascus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- World dignitaries and tens of
thousands of ordinary Syrians Tuesday paid tribute to late Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad, who died of heart attack Saturday.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, this city of 4 million residents was shrouded in
black. Some Syrians spent the night along the cortege route, which
was closed to traffic. Others turned out early in the morning,
dressed in black, walking in groups, to mourn over the death of
their leader.
</P>
<P>
The daylong state funeral started at 8:00 a.m. (0500 GMT)
Tuesday as soldiers in battle dress and maroon berets carried on
their shoulders Assad's flag-wrapped coffin, from his home in the
Rawda residential neighborhood of Damascus to the main Ummayyad
Square.
</P>
<P>
Preceded by a military band and troops carrying wreaths and
followed by senior officials from the ruling Baath party, the
government and the military and Assad's family members, the
procession moved slowly through the wide palm-lined streets toward
the square.
</P>
<P>
At 10:45 a.m. (0745 GMT), Assad's casket arrived at the People's
Palace, where only foreign dignitaries and officials were allowed
to pay their last respects to Assad and offer condolences to
Bashar, Assad's second son and the heir apparent.
</P>
<P>
Pall bearing soldiers moved the coffin from the gun carriage
which has borne it from the presidential palace in a one-kilometer
cortege, to the main hall of the white-marble People's Palace.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami, Lebanese President Emile Lahoud, Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright were among
hundreds of foreign dignitaries coming to pay homage to Assad and
offer condolences to Bashar.
</P>
<P>
At 15:00 (1200 GMT) Assad's casket will be flown from Mazze
military air base outside Damascus to the northern coastal city of
Lattaqieh and on to Assad's hometown Qerdaha, where Assad is to be
buried in a family mausoleum beside his son Basil who died in a car
crash in 1994.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Several Philippine government
agencies teamed up Tuesday to lead an anti-human trafficking
campaign in the country to enforce the related program advocated
by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Among the leading group are National Police Commission (NPC),
the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) and the
Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), the government said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The government-led campaign is aimed at implementing "
Coalitions Against Trafficking in the Philippines", a United
Nations Global Program being piloted in the country, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, leaders of the leading government
agencies, together with leaders of Social Welfare Department,
Justice Department, Labor Department and other government units,
will sign a Memorandum of Undertaking on June 14, 2000 to enforce
the U.N. program against human trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The government said the pilot project was envisioned to
strengthen crime prevention strategies against trafficking,
improve effectiveness of law enforcement and criminal justice
responses as well as provide protection and assistance to victims.
</P>
<P>
Activities lined up for the program are assistance in setting
up of specialized computer databases, preparation of a compilation
of relevant legislation, bilateral and multilateral agreements,
conduct training for law enforcers, prosecutors, social workers
and front-line officers, and conduct of a comprehensive public
awareness campaign.
</P>
<P>
On March 28, 2000, the Philippine government signed an
agreement with the U.N. Center of International Crime Prevention
to implement the said pilot demonstration project.

<HEADLINE> International Fair on Low-Cost Housing to be Held in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- An international exhibition on the
material industry for low-cost housing in developing countries is
to be held here between June 30 and July 9 this year.
</P>
<P>
Jointly sponsored by the Common Market for Eastern and Southern
Africa (COMESA), the Indian government and the United Nations
Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO ), the exhibition will
be attended by policy makers, governments, private agencies and
professionals engaged in housing programs, according to a
statement from the COMESA center in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka-based newspaper The Post Tuesday quoted the
statement as saying that the proposed event will promote
international cooperation between COMESA member states and other
African countries for the transfer and sharing of manufacturing
technologies of composite materials appropriate for housing.
</P>
<P>
The event will also provide an opportunity for stakeholders
from the COMESA member states to exchange their experiences with
their counterparts.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the changing demographic and
migratory trends in developing countries are exerting pressure on
the domestic construction industry for improving efficiency,
productivity and delivery systems to meet housing needs for
citizens in the low-income strata.
</P>
<P>
It indicated that due to the severe shortage of building
materials, housing has become unaffordable to large segments of
the population in low income brackets.

NAIROBI, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has instructed provincial officials to make concerted efforts to
closely and effectively monitor the famine rampant in the east
African country.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation newspaper Tuesday quoted the president as
saying that effectively monitoring the famine will reduce the
suffering caused by the current protracted drought.
</P>
<P>
Moi emphasized that relief food must reach the targeted
recipients through the local community-based committees.
</P>
<P>
He urged those who coordinate food distribution not to forget
the urban poor.

Moi made an urgent appeal for foreign food aid last week and
has received the response from the Italian government, the World
Food Program and other governments and aid agencies.

LUSAKA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will sign a new African
Caribbean Pacific (APC) partnership agreement with the European
Union (EU) despite opposition from a civil society in the country.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia Tuesday quoted Zambian Commerce Minister
William Harrington as saying that his country has agreed in
principle with other ACP countries to sign the agreement next week
in Cotonou, the capital of Benin.
</P>
<P>
Days before Harrington made the remarks, the Economics
Association of Zambia (EAZ) warned the government against rushing
into the agreement.

what measures the EU is taking for the products which will enjoy
preferential treatment.
</P>
<P>
Harrington said the signing of the document is going ahead
while the EAZ is free to make its presentation officially to the
government.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, ACP countries will determine their
strategies and Least Developed Countries (LDCs), landlocked and
island countries will be given special treatment.
</P>
<P>
"We do not just want free but fair trade access to the EU
market and the transfer of technology to LDCs," Harrington said.

BELGRADE -- The two largest rival coalitions have won local

According to ballots counted overnight, the coalition "For a

Yugoslavia," which with the support of the Yugoslav Left and the
Serbian Radical Party is headed by Yugoslav Prime Minister Momir
Bulatovic, has emerged victoriously in Herzeg Novi. Montenegro's
pro-Western president Djukanovic stands for independence, but
Bulatovic's side wants this tiny mountainous republic to remain

<HEADLINE> UNDP Calls for Investment in Human Resources in Developing Western China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) official said that investment in human resources is
the "most important" first step China should take before seeking
capital funds for the development of the western region.
</P>
<P>
Kerstin Leitner, UNDP resident representative to China, made
the remark at an international symposium on development of the
western part of China, held in Chongqing, southwest China.
</P>
<P>
"China's western region has to be developed by the people
living in the area for the development to be sustainable and
equitable," Leitner said.
</P>
<P>
"Once people know how to articulate their needs, it is much
easier to mobilize resources," Leitner added.
</P>
<P>
If capital investment is made without the people having a clear
and agreed vision, strategy and capacity to implement, capital
funds can easily be squandered through higher costs, wastage, and
leakage of funds through corruption, the UNDP official noted.
</P>
<P>
Leitner said that the development of China's western region has
many challenges, but also many opportunities. There are lessons
learnt and best practices from international experiences.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Locate Origin of Sediments in Yellow River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese water control experts
have found that grit in the middle reaches of the Yellow River is
mainly to blame for the accumulation of sediments in this China's
second longest river.
</P>
<P>
Based on four years' field study and intensive analysis of data
collected, the water control experts concluded that most of the
sediments in the Yellow River come from the 78,600-sq-km gritty
area in the middle reaches of the river. The discovery would pave
the way for effective sediments-control in the future, they said.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River is known as the most sandy river in the world.
Of the river sediments, about 400 million tons of grit are too big
in size and heavy to be carried by the river water into the sea,
which accumulated and thereby resulted in the elevation of the
river banks in the lower reaches at an annual rate of ten
centimeters.
</P>
<P>
"As long as we find the major source of sediments in the river,
we can intensify efforts against soil erosion in the area which
will greatly reduce the piling-up of sediments in the lower
reaches," said a water control expert on the research panel.

<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- China is stepping up efforts to
boost energy efficiency nationwide to ensure sustainable
development of the energy sector and narrow the gap between energy
supply and demand, according to today's China Electric Power News.
</P>
<P>
China saved energy sources equivalent to 834 million tons of
standard coal between 1981 and 1998, with the annual average rate
of energy saving at 4.4 percent nationwide, the paper cited Bai
Rongchun, a senior official with the State Economic and Trade
Commission, as saying.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the country reduced carbon dioxide emission by 250
million cubic meters during the period.
</P>
<P>
The official said that enterprises may gain much better
economic efficiency by saving energy and raw materials, for energy
and raw materials account for about 75 percent of an enterprise's
production costs on average.
</P>
<P>
China will save 10 billion yuan if the national total of
production costs is lowered by one percentage point, he added.
</P>
<P>
The official urged all localities to work out relevant rules
and regulations governing energy saving endeavors, and pay high
attention to the development of energy-efficient technologies.

agreement on issues pertaining to the final status accord.
</P>
<P>
According to the hosts, holding the meetings at an isolated
site, away from the media, is an essential element of success. As a
result, there is a complete black out on the talks.
</P>
<P>
A senior government official said on Monday that there have been
major improvements in the relations between the Palestinian police
and Israeli security forces, following last month's bloody
incidents during which Palestinian police and IDF troops exchanged
fire.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Health Minister Shlomo Benizri apologized for
Holocaust survivors for comparing Education Minister Yossi Sarid's
methods to the Nazis' propaganda against the Jews, but he did not
make any apologies to Sarid himself.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak condemned Benizri's remarks, saying
that there is no place for such comparisons in the Israeli dialog,
and called for all parties to unite around common goals.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak met with Eli Yishai, chair
of the religous ultra-Orthodox Shas Party, at the prime minister's
official residence in Jerusalem Monday night for the first time
since Shas voted in favor of a bill supporting dissolving the
Knesset (parliament).
</P>
<P>
Barak asked Yishai to instruct his party to vote in favor of
throwing out the bill advocating early dissolution of the Knesset,
and promises to meet Shas' demands. Shas said they will not meet
Barak's demands if they do not secure a satisfied deal first.

<HEADLINE> MILF Not In Position to Mount Major Offensive: Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The rebel group of Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF), which is based in Mindanao, is believed
to be incapable to mount any major offensive at this time, the
government said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Press Secretary Ricardo Puno said in a radio interview that the
MILF does not have enough strength to recapture the camps overrun
by the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP).
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they are strong enough to retake their major
camps. It appears they have spread out into smaller units," said
Puno, who is also the presidential spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Citing reports from the AFP, Puno said the MILF engaged
government troops in skirmishes in some areas of Cotabato.
</P>
<P>
But, he stressed that the AFP is in control of the situation
and that AFP Chief of Staff Angelo Reyes continues to monitor the
developments.
</P>
<P>
The military maintain a defensive line around Camp Abubakar,
where MILF forces have assembled after the MILF's other camps fell
to the AFP, Puno said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the military said, one more MILF satellite camp was
overran by the military, bringing to 11 the major MILF camps
captured by government forces since March this year.
</P>
<P>
The military, however, has spared so far Camp Abubakar, the
main MILF camp in Maguindanao, Mindanao.

NAIROBI, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Fishery legislation in three east
African countries is to be harmonized before the end of this
year, according to a senior Kenyan official.
</P>
<P>
"Fishery and legal experts from Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania will

 pollution control and general environmental reservation in the
three countries," Ojiambo said.

<P>
Lake Victoria, the second largest fresh water lake in the
world, is currently plagued by some environmental problems, such

NAIROBI, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi

in curbing the growing trend of trafficking and consumption of
drugs which threatened to destroy the youth.

<HEADLINE> Stalks to Improve Environment in West China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Transportation of stalks-
processed fodder from central and east China to western provinces
will ease the desertification there, said experts from Ministry of
Agriculture and Ministry of Science and Technology today.
</P>
<P>
Experts emphasized excessive stock rasing in west China has
resulted in serious desertification, while limitation on stock
raising will be a bad solution, which will reduce the herdsmen's
income and living standards. Low-cost fodder will be a good resort.
</P>
<P>
Transport of stalk-made fodder from Tianjin, Hebei, and Beijing
to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will not cost much, but it
will realize a balance between the two areas in stalks supply and
demand.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local stalks can be used to fertilize the limited
farmland there, increasing the crops yield and realizing sustained
development of agriculture, they said.
</P>
<P>
According to their research work, 5,000 kg of stalks for per
hectare will increase the crops yield by at least 370 kg, and
three consecutive years of returning stalks to farmland will raise
the organic materials proportion in the soil by about six percent.
</P>
<P>
As the summer harvest approaches, China is reminding its
farmers to heed the ban on crop stalks burning.
</P>
<P>
Government officials said that burning of large amounts of crop
stalks not only pollutes the air, but also affects the normal
operation of trains, buses and planes.
</P>
<P>
Burning of crop stalks would be banned this year especially on
both sides of 13 expressways, including the Beijing-Shijiazhuang,
Shanghai-Hangzhou and Xi'an-Baoji expressways, and of some
sections of the Beijing-Guangzhou and Beijing-Shenyang railway
lines.
</P>
<P>
Of the 600 million tons of crop stalks China produces every
year, 100 million tons are turned into manure and returned to the
farmland, 170 million tons are processed into fodder, and the rest
are either burned or cast away.

<HEADLINE> Obese Guy Finds difficulty in Loosing Weight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Meng Qinggang, 20, is worried not
only about his obesity but also about how to find a traffic tool
to take him to a hospital to receive treatment.
</P>
<P>
Meng, weighing 265 kilograms, or 583.7 pounds, is as heavy as
four men of his age. His chest, waist, and hip measurements all
surpass two meters.
</P>
<P>
The 1.80-meter-tall young man has been stranded for seven years
at his home in Harbin, capital city of northeast China's
Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
No shoes and clothes can suit him well. As he suffers from
erysipelas, his legs can hardly support him.
</P>
<P>
Recently he sent a telegraph to Tianjin Aimin Hospital,
requesting whether the hospital can provide an appropriate traffic
tool so that he can travel to Tianjin, about 1,300 kilometers away
from Harbin. Earlier report says that Tianjin Aimin Hospital has
succeeded in helping a 19-year-old boy loose 50 kilograms of
weight to 157 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
A team of experts from the hospital immediately flied to Harbin.
Their initial diagnosis suggests that the boy is suffering from
simple obesity.
</P>
<P>
But the experts have not got any idea about how to bring Meng
to Tianjin from Harbin since the heavy man can not take a plane, a
train, nor a bus.
</P>
<P>
It would take at least a month before the guy gets to Tianjin
if riding on a horse-drawn carriage.

<HEADLINE> China County Trying New Election for Township Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Xincai County in central China's
Henan province took the lead in adopting a new election system to
choose township leaders, first ever in China.
</P>
<P>
"The result proved very satisfactory," said Xu Qingyun,
secretary of the county committee of the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
Local residents above 18 years old nominate three primary
candidates, one of whom will then be selected as the final
candidate by villager representatives. Finally, the township
people's congress will vote for the candidate strictly according
to law, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
In order to win voters' trust, the candidates must make public
speeches to elaborate on their administration plans and promise a
clean government. Then the villagers vote on the spot and the
result is announced immediately.
</P>
<P>
Tong Xiaoqian, who had been working for the county's family
planning for 10 years, was elected as township leader through the
abovementioned election procedures. He was chosen as a candidate
by villagers, winning 50.2 per cent of votes.
</P>
<P>
When talking about the election, Tong said, "I am elected by
the people, so I must do my best to serve the people. My words and
actions are all under public scrutiny, so I won't relax myself."
</P>
<P>
Different from before, the new election system fully reflects
people's will and highly respect voters' right, and more, it can
help avoid malpractice in selecting officials, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
According to China's common practice, township leader nominees
are selected by the superior organizations.

The Chinese government will encourage and support Chinese
enterprises with strong economic strength to engage in mutually-
beneficial cooperation with Botswanian counterparts in various
forms, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that President Mogae's entourage includes a number of

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Check Taliban-Linked Bank Accounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Bank Monday asked all
commercial banks to check whether any organization directly
supporting Afghanistan's Taliban government is operating bank
accounts in Bangladesh, The Daily Star reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh Bank took the action after the U.N.Security
Council sent a letter to the Foreign Ministry of Bangladesh saying
it has information that the Taliban are operating "in this region.
"
</P>
<P>
The council also named a few organizations in India which are
financially supporting the Taliban. It requested Bangladesh to
check if such organizations are also operating from the country.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry forwarded the letter to the Finance
Ministry which sent it to the Bangladesh Bank. But details were
not available.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban issue came to the limelight when U.S. President
Bill Clinton canceled a scheduled trip to a number of places in
the country, including the National Memorial, for security reasons
during his official visit to Bangladesh on March 20 this year.
</P>
<P>
Though full details were not given about the cancellation,
there were unconfirmed reports that the Taliban or their followers
were preparing to shoot down the helicopter carrying the U.S.
president.
</P>
<P>
Though it could not be officially confirmed that there was any
organization in Bangladesh having links with the Taliban, police
earlier raided the office of a monthly magazine suspecting that it
had links with the Taliban.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand's Manufacturing Industry Grows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand achieved a growth
in manufactured exports of over 12 percent for the year from April
1999 to March 2000, with their value topping the 10 billion NZ
dollar (about 4.7 billion U.S. dollar) mark for the first time.
</P>
<P>
"This is good news for the sector. It clearly identifies the
increasing importance of manufacturing to job growth and the
economy generally," President David Moloney of the New Zealand
Manufacturers Federation said in a media release here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"A major bright spark in the current climate is that value
added manufactured exports or ETMs (elaborately transformed
manufactures) now constitute over 30 percent of all exports. Over
the past 10 years ETM exports have grown by a robust 140 percent.
By comparison primary sector exports have grown by only 37 percent,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Moloney noted that the transition from an economy solely
dependent on agriculture for export earnings has been remarkable.
</P>
<P>
"In 1960 only 2 percent of exports came from the manufacturing
sector. That contribution has since grown to 44 percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moloney said that over the last 10 years the annual growth rate
of the manufacturing industry has averaged 7.3 percent, more than
double New Zealand's overall growth rate.

<P>
HARARE, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The number of people killed in
political- motivated violence in Zimbabwe has risen to 26 since
February this year following the death of two people over the
weekend, the daily Herald reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Police spokesman Superintendent Bvudzijena said the
pair's death was disappointing, adding that the police would
continue to educate people that elections are decided by the
ballot and not by beating up each other.
</P>
<P>
However, Bvudzijena insisted that despite the latest deaths,
the reported incidents of political violence were on the decline.
</P>
<P>
He called on political leaders to assist the police by
educating party supporters at grassroots level to shun violence.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that about 470 people have been arrested,
over 150 others injured and property worth several millions of
dollars destroyed in more than 300 politically motivated clashes
in the run-up to the fifth parliamentary elections scheduled for
June 24-25.

BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Environmental protection
administrative office in Beijing recently shut down 23 local
enterprises whose discharges failed to reach the set standard.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises involved industries of food processing, brewing
and chemistry. They were ordered to stop production since they
were not able to make positive changes within a set period.
Another 13 enterprises were fined.
</P>
<P>
Beijing government has been trying to improve its environmental
conditions. It has moved 53 eco-endangering enterprises out of the
downtown area and invested 4.4 billion yuan (about 528 million U.S.
dollars) in aiding 789 enterprises with purifying equipment
installation in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
Due to the efforts, the discharged sulfur dioxide, fume, and
dust by industrial enterprises last year decreased by 40,700 tons,
79,600 tons and 41,100 tons respectively compared with 1996.

<P>
ZHENGZHOU, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Experts with the consultant
group of World Bank said after a recent examination that
construction on the Xiaolangdi Water Control Project, a key
project to harness the sand silting of the Yellow River's bed, has
brought no damage to the surrounding environment since it started
six years ago.
</P>
<P>
Harvey F. Ludwig, chief expert of the group, said tests by the
experts of World Bank show that all the index of the project have
reached the world standard in terms of environmental protection.
It is clear that authority's awareness and measures to protect
environment have been well carried out during the construction
work, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ludwig, also a Ph.D. at Harvard University and famous
specialist in the circle, said the work on environmental
protection at Xiaolangdi is most likely to become a model for
other project constructions in China later.
</P>
<P>
The Xiaolangdi Water Control Project, constructed with World
Bank Loan, is one of China's key projects having the functions of
flood and ice floe control, silt reduction, irrigation and water
supply. Its construction site is located 40 km north of Zhengzhou,

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Ban Import of Low-Grade Coal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- As inferior-quality coal continues
to pollute the air and atmosphere, the Ministry of Environment and
Forest(MOEF) has urged the authorities concerned to take necessary
steps to ban the import of low-grade coal containing more than 1
percent sulfur.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Ministry of Commerce, the MOEF said coal of
a high sulfur content affects public health and the environment
badly and also causes acid rain, The Independent reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The letter noted that many countries have already banned the
use of coal containing more than 1 percent sulfur and Bangladesh
will have to follow suit to save its environment from further
degradation.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that Bangladesh imports about 200,000
tons of coal annually. However, a large quantity of coal is
entering the country through irregular way.
</P>
<P>
Most of the coal comes from India and it contains more than 4
percent sulfur. This low-grade coal is cheaper than bituminous
coal having less than 1 percent sulfur.
</P>
<P>
The inferior-quality coal is being used in bricking and other
industrial units in the country. With the burning of this coal,
sulfur spreads in the air with smoke and badly affects human
health.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Rice Export to Drop Slightly in Value </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Falling rice prices in the
international market caused the value of Thai rice exports to drop
slightly by 0.89 percent to 25.78 billion baht (661 million U.S.
dollars) in the first five months of this year, despite a 5.02-
percent increase in export volume, The Nation reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted the Thai Rice Exporter Association as
saying that from January to May, Thailand exported 2.42 million
tons of rice compared with 2.31 million tons in the same period of
last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the total export value of rice in the first five
months of this year declined to 25.78 billion baht from 26.02
billion baht (667 million dollars) a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The price of rice in the export market slid as output in major
producers -- Vietnam, India, Indonesia, Myanmar and Thailand --
rose significantly this year, causing an oversupply.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the world's rice trade is forecast to drop by 8
percent to 23 million tons, as predicted by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the problem, the Thai government is planning
intervention measures to shore up rice prices before the main
crops enter the market later this year.
</P>
<P>
However, Somboon Pathaichan, manager of the rice association,
was quoted as saying he is optimistic that Thailand will achieve
its export target of 6 million tons this year.
</P>
<P>
He explained that international rice trading will be active in
the latter half of the year when producers' main crops reach the
market.
</P>
<P>
To soften the effects of the fall in price in the long run, the
Thai government plans to set aside 8 billion baht (205 million
dollars) to build rice barns in main growing areas throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
The barns are designed to improve storage, which will help
delay rice from entering the market and enable the farmers to
monitor the prices of their crops.
</P>
<P>
The barns will also have drying, polishing and packaging
facilities, which will help improve the quality of rice.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Import More Sugar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The government has finally given
permission to the Bangladesh Sugar and Food Industries Corporation
for importing 25,000 tons more of sugar, The Financial Express
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
With this volume, the corporation's total sugar import will
stand at 100,000 tons for the current fiscal.
</P>
<P>
The country's total sugar imports will now amount to 200,000
tons for the current season as the government has also allowed the
Trade Corporation of Bangladesh to import 100,000 tons of sugar.
</P>
<P>
The country was forced to import a record quantity of sugar
this year because of a drastic fall in the production of the local
sugar industry.
</P>
<P>
A senior government official was quoted as saying the country's
sugar output sharply declined in the just-concluded crushing
session due to inadequate supply of sugarcane.
</P>
<P>
Some 1.612 million tons of sugarcane was available for crushing
in the 1999-21000 crushing session against a target fixed at 2.2
million tons. As a result, the country's sugar output sharply fell
short of target during the period.

<HEADLINE> Campaigning for Japan's General Election Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Campaigning for the June 25 general
election for Japan's House of Representatives officially got under
way on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,400 candidates are expected to vie for the 480 seats
in the lower chamber, 300 of which are in single-seat
constituencies and 180 will be distributed to parties by
proportional representation.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of political parties took to the streets in the morning
throughout Japan to kick off the 12-day official campaign period.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minster Yoshiro Mori made the pitch for the Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) at a station in Tokyo, calling on voters to
let the present three-party coalition stay in power.
</P>
<P>
While Yukio Hatoyama, leader of the largest opposition party,
the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), urged voters to cast their
ballots for "a new political framework led by the DPJ" in Izumo,
Shimane Prefecture, western Japan.
</P>
<P>
The election, which will be the first general election in
almost four years, is generally regarded as a test for Prime
Minister Yoshiro Mori and his ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
The coalition, which comprises the LDP, New Komeito and New
Conservative Party, is aiming to capture 254 seats in order to
keep an comfortable majority in the lower house.
</P>
<P>
The DPJ will be leading the opposition camp in a fresh
offensive against Mori, whose public support is in tatters after a
string of controversial remarks reviving memories of Japan's
militaristic past.
</P>
<P>
During the campaign period, candidates are expected to engage
in heated discussions on various political issues, including
measures to stimulate the Japanese economy, fiscal restructuring,
social security and education.
</P>
<P>
The number of seats in Japan's powerful lower chamber will be
cut to 480, following the February enactment of a legislation to
reduce the number of proportional representation seats by 20.
</P>
<P>
The election falls on what would have been the 63rd birthday of
the late Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, Mori's predecessor, who died
on May 14.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Indian Minister's Visit Obtains Limited Success  by Lian Guohui </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Indian External Affairs Minister
Jaswant Singh, who wound up his two-day visit to Sri Lanka Monday
evening, has accomplished limited success despite much fanfare
about the trip, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
Singh Monday reiterated India's support for the unity,
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka which has been
troubled by an upsurge in the long-running civil war.
</P>
<P>
Singh made clear India's stand during his formal discussions on
Monday with Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga and Foreign
Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar, said a Sri Lanka-India joint
statement released at the end of Singh's two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Singh expressed "the continued commitment of
the government of India to the unity, sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Sri Lanka."
</P>
<P>
He also conveyed the good wishes and support of the Indian
government for the restoration of a lasting peace through a
possible political process which would result in a settlement
satisfactory to all communities.
</P>
<P>
Singh brought a credit amounting to 100 million U.S. dollars in
a bid to fulfill India's promise to provide humanitarian
assistance to Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that apart from political and moral support
there is no substantial Indian help to bring an end to Sri Lanka's
civil war despite the humanitarian loan.
</P>
<P>
Singh is the first Indian leader to visit here since April when
the civil war in Sri Lanka flared up again between government
troops and Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels who are
fighting a 17-year war to carve out a separate homeland for
minority Tamils in the island's north and east.
</P>
<P>
Singh flew into Colombo on a special flight Sunday afternoon.
Immediately after his arrival, he had an unscheduled 45-minute
meeting with his Sri Lankan counterpart, Kadirgamar.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the situation in Jaffna took high priority
at the talks.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday evening, Singh held informal discussions with
President Kumaratunga over dinner.
</P>
<P>
During the formal talks on Monday President Kumaratunga
apprised Singh of the current war situation and political
developments, including the consultations between the government
and other political parties and the facilitation efforts of Norway.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga welcomed India's offer of assistance in the
humanitarian and economic spheres to ease the constraints that may
be currently faced by Sri Lanka, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Kadirgamar hosted a lunch for his Indian counterpart at his
residence on Monday. It is understood that bilateral discussions
had continued over lunch.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the opposition Ranil Wickremesinghe called on Singh
to express his party's stand. Several moderate Tamil parties'
leaders also met Singh later.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka had earlier sought India's help when several military
camps in the northern Jaffna peninsula fell into the hands of the
LTTE.
</P>
<P>
However, India is wary of direct military involvement because
of internal politics and its bitter experience in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
India's ruling coalition includes several Tamil parties, which
have often expressed support for a separate homeland for Sri Lanka
's Tamils.
</P>
<P>
In a recent statement, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi,
an influential Tamil leader, suggested that Sri Lanka be split
along ethnic lines as a solution to the 17-year-long ethnic
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Karunanidhi, who is head of the DMK regional party, a powerful
partner in India's coalition government, said earlier this month
that Sri Lanka could end its "unhappy marriage" between the
majority Sinhalese and minority Tamils with a partition similar to
that of the former Czechoslovakia.
</P>
<P>
The suggestion has been flatly rejected by Colombo, where Media
Minister Mangala Samaraweera said it would lead to the "
balkanization" of Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious that the hands of the BJP government are well
and truly tied by the pro-LTTE forces... and it cannot help Sri
Lanka," Sri Lanka's Island newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Historically, India had tried to broker an end to Sri Lanka's
civil war, but in vain.
</P>
<P>
Between 1987 to 1990, India lost 1,200 soldiers who were part
of a peacekeeping force in northern Sri Lanka. The Indian force
was hastily withdrawn in 1990 and New Delhi has since stayed on
the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, India last month ruled out military involvement
in the island nation's civil war.
</P>
<P>
However, India has been in close contact with the Sri Lankan
government and promised humanitarian assistance if asked.
</P>
<P>
Indian External Affairs Ministry Spokesman R. S. Jassal told
reporters in New Delhi Saturday that Singh's visit was "part of a
high-level political engagement" between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
However, local public opinion believed that the visit was much
designed to calm apprehensions in Colombo about the recent
statements made by Karunanidhi.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said there is much skepticism about what India can do
to help resolve the conflict.
</P>
<P>
"Sri Lanka cannot hope much from India in its hour of need,"
the Island newspaper said in its leader on Monday. "We have to be
pragmatic and look elsewhere for immediate assistance."
</P>
<P>
But recently, India has backed a negotiated settlement of the
conflict and has said it would mediate if invited by both sides.
</P>
<P>
Since Sri Lanka's conflicting sides have yet to ask for Indian
help, India seems to be at a loss what to do to help end the
island's ethnic war.

<HEADLINE> Thai Agriculture Must Meet WTO Requirements: Vice PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's agriculture sector
should take measures to meet the requirements of the World Trade
Organization(WTO), Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panichpakdi
was quoted by Tuesday's Business Day as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Thailand, as well as other member countries of the WTO, is
being required to fully adhere to the WTO frame of free trade
regulations within a certain period," noted Supachai, who is
scheduled to head the WTO in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
As a developing country, Thailand is required to reduce import
tax on 740 agricultural items from 49 percent to 24 percent by the
year 2004, according to Supachai.
</P>
<P>
In order not to violate the WTO trade rules, he said, Thailand
must also reduce its support subsidy for agricultural production
from 21.82 billion baht (560 million U.S. dollars) set in 1995 to
19 billion baht (487 million dollars) by the year 2004.
</P>
<P>
He said the country may need to resort to other methods which
are not against WTO regulations to protect its own agricultural
production in the domestic market and to promote it in foreign
markets.
</P>
<P>
To meet the WTO requirements on its agricultural products, he
also said, Thailand must develop and impose stricter controls over
its production methods and quantities, as well as marketing
strategies.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Busts International Children Smugglers Gang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 13 (Xinhua) -- A Pakistan agency, with close
cooperation of the government of the United Arab Emirates (UAE),
has busted an international gang involved in smuggling children to
the oil-rich Gulf region, the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency had been cautiously carrying out the surveillance of
the gang and was monitoring their nefarious activities closely. As
a result the agency managed to get hold of the culprits in Dubai
with close collaboration of the UAE government.
</P>
<P>
Agency officials disclosed that the gang comprises other
culprits also from Sindh, Pakistan. It has been learned that the
gang had its tentacles in the Gulf and other neighboring countries
as well. Authorities are investigating the case around the clock
to arrest the whole gang of smugglers, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The children are smuggled to the Gulf states for camel race
which is a popular sport in Gulf countries. Small kids are
fastened to the back of camels, which are made to run at the drum
beat. The changing rhythm of the drum beat acts as goad to run the
camel faster which makes the children shriek with fear and terror.
Sometimes the frightened children fall from the camel back and are
crushed underneath the camel's feet.
</P>
<P>
Over the years children smuggling has become a flourishing
business. The price of each smuggled child for this purpose in
Pakistan under the age of 8-10 years ranges from 1,200 to 1,400 U.
S. dollars.

<P>
KATHMANDU, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Nepali experts on avian health
Tuesday urged the government and people to do more to ensure safe
production and consumption of poultry.
</P>
<P>
At an avian health workshop, experts emphasized that with
better management and investigation, major poultry diseases such
as the Newcastle disease could be brought under control.
</P>
<P>

could be controlled by hatcheries and commercial farms preparing
vaccines through the research in the disease," said Dr. S. N.
Mahato.
</P>
<P>
Mahato pointed out that investigation has not yet materialized.
"It must be there at the basic level, at policy level and its
implementation must also be seen at the research level," he added.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, provisions for prevention against diseases is
essential and consumer awareness on their eating habits should
also be emphasized, Mahato said.
</P>
<P>
Poultry farming is popular in Nepal as poultry is one of the
main sources of meat for people.

<HEADLINE> National Sovereignty Inviolable, Says Chinese Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chairman of the Standing
Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress Li Peng said
here Monday that the sovereignty of a nation is inviolable.
</P>
<P>
Li, who arrived here Sunday for an official visit to Yugoslavia,
made the remarks when meeting Srdja Bozovic, Chairman of the
Chamber of the Federal Assembly of Yugoslavia and Milomir Minic,
Chairman of the Chamber of the Citizens of the Federal Assembly.
</P>
<P>
He condemned certain countries for putting "human rights above
sovereignty" as an excuse to invade a sovereign country.
</P>
<P>
China has held that all nations, big or small, rich or poor and
strong or weak, are equal, Li said, adding that each country has
its own characteristics.
</P>
<P>
It is the business of its people and government to choose the
way of development, the system and ideology and to settle its
internal problems, and any other foreign forces have no rights to
interfere with any excuses.
</P>
<P>
Li also exchanged views with the two chairmen on Sino-Yugoslav
relations and further expanding contacts and cooperation between
the parliaments of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that China and Yugoslavia have cherished their
traditional cooperative ties, which have weathered the ups and
downs at the international stage.
</P>
<P>
The long-time friendship dates back to World War II when the
two peoples supported each other and fought side by side against
fascism, he recalled.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that the joint declaration signed by Chinese President
Jiang Zemin and his Yugoslav counterpart Slobodan Milosevic in
1997 in Beijing laid a solid foundation for closer Yugoslavia-
China relations.
</P>
<P>
He praised the Yugoslav people for their marked achievements in
reconstructing their country, which endured 78 days of NATO
bombing last year.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that endowed with rich resources,
Yugoslavia could revive its economy through its people's
painstaking effort despite the present difficulties.
</P>
<P>
On inter-parliamentary cooperation, Li hoped his visit will
promote exchanges and cooperation between the parliaments of the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Bozovic lauded that Li's visit has turned a new
leaf in developing bilateral ties on the basis of equality and
mutual-benefit.
</P>
<P>
Bozovic described the inter-parliamentary cooperation as an
important component of bilateral ties, saying that Yugoslavia has
attached great importance to developing exchange and conducting
dialogue between the two parliaments.
</P>
<P>
He expressed admiration over the great achievements China has
made in reform and opening-up, saying that these attainments have
made China a heavyweight in international affairs and fortified
its position and influence in international organizations such as
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Bozovic appreciated the Chinese stance of combating hegemonism
and favoring a world multi-polarization, and spoke highly of the
position and policies adopted by the Chinese government in
handling the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
Li is also scheduled to meet Yugoslav President Milosevic and
Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia is the first leg of Li's six-nation tour, which also
covers Slovenia, Croatia, Slovakia, Azerbaijan and Ukraine.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Company Develops Technology For E-mails From Submarines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Benthos Inc. has
developed a new way to send e-mails longer distances under the
ocean than ever before, said a news release of the company.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Navy last month used the technology to send e-mails
from a submarine off the coast of California to a naval base in
San Diego and to other underwater modems, Benthos said.
</P>
<P>
While cruising at a depth of 400 feet, the USS Dolphin was able
to send e-mails up to a distance of three miles to a relayer buoy,
which transferred them to land, Benthos president and chief
executive officer John L. Coughlin said.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot overstate the importance of this advancement which
dramatically illustrates the viability of wireless underwater
communications," he claimed, adding that what excites him most is
that it is only the tip of the iceberg in the creation of a whole
new technology.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that a submarine, operating at submerged
depth and speed, has been able to communicate without giving away
its position by raising an antenna or surfacing, according to
Benthos news release which stressed the achievement represents a
dramatic step change in undersea technology.
</P>
<P>
The technology not only has military applications, but can be
used by the gas and oil drilling industry, for weather tracking
and for other underwater research, Coughlin said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Nuclear Weapons Secrets Once Again "Missing" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 12 (Xinhua) -- An investigation has been
launched into the disappearance of nuclear weapons secrets from
Los Alamos National Laboratory two months ago, officials and media
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"This is an extremely serious matter, and we are taking swift
actions to deal with it," laboratory director John Browne said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
Ed Curran, director of the Energy Department's office of
counterintelligence, said, "there is no evidence that suggests
espionage is involved in this incident."
</P>
<P>
NBC News reported the hard drives were first discovered to be
missing two months ago, before the Los Alamos wildfire that forced
the lab to shut down on May 8. The lab was closed for two weeks
with only a skeleton crew on hand.
</P>
<P>
CNN News reported that the classified information pertained to
a wide variety of, both U.S. and Russian, nuclear weapons, and
that the disappearance of the records was reported to Energy
Department headquarters on June 1.
</P>
<P>
The investigation is being conducted in conjunction with the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which was notified of the
problem on June 2, CNN said.
</P>
<P>
The University of California at Berkeley, which manages the
weapons laboratory for the Energy Department, has also launched a
separate inquiry.
</P>
<P>
The latest "missing" of nuclear weapons secrets from Los Alamos
National Laboratory comes after a so-called espionage involving
the lab and one of its employees, Dr. Wen Ho Lee, who was fired in
March 1999 after allegedly copying nuclear weapons secrets and
storing them on an unclassified computer network.
</P>
<P>
Lee has pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times, which broke both stories, this time said
the new security breach was not believed to be related to the Lee
case and was thought to have occurred long after his dismissal
from the lab.
</P>
<P>
The Times said the hard drives were missing when investigators
searched for them on June 1 after a wildfire scorched the facility,
sparing the lab's major buildings but destroying 39 trailers and
sheds.
</P>
<P>
Many of those outbuildings were used as offices for staff
members, and the blaze wiped out several years worth of scientific

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Agrees to Pay for Nixon Papers, Tapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Justice Department has
agreed to compensate late ex-President Nixon 18 million U.S.
dollars for his presidential papers, tapes and the like seized
when Nixon resigned in 1974.
</P>
<P>
The settlement came after a lengthy lawsuit in the U.S.
District Court in Washington over the value of the papers, 3,700
hours of tape recordings, photos and other items.
</P>
<P>
"This settlement brings to a close 10 years of litigation
surrounding President Nixon's papers," said David Ogden, acting
assistant attorney general, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress passed a law confiscating Nixon's papers and
tapes after he resigned over the Watergate affair in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Nixon sued for compensation six years after his materials were
seized. The estate took up the lawsuit after Nixon died on April
22, 1994 and asked for compensation of 200 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, a federal district court ruled that the papers and
materials were not Nixon's private property, but a federal appeals
court overturned the decision one year later and ruled that the
estate was entitled to be paid the fair value of the seized
materials.
</P>
<P>
Directors of the Nixon Foundation will decide how the funds
will be used.

<HEADLINE> 4,000-year-old City Relics Discovered in Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, June 13 (Xinhua) -- If it were not for the thorough
research of veteran archaeologists, the residents at Guchengzhai
village of Xinmi city, in the northern part of central China's
Henan province, would not realize the value of their living place.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists recently announced that the Guchengzhai
village was a well-preserved city relics constructed more than 4,
000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Experts found that three sides of square-shaped city walls and
the north and south city gates still remain. The 176,000-square-
meters city relics is believed to be the largest and best-
preserved one, which was built at the Longshan period about 4,000
years ago, among the ever found historic relics.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, the city was abandoned around one hundred
years after completion.
</P>
<P>
Li Boqian, chief scientist with the project of dividing China's
early history (about 2,000 years ago) into periods, said
scientists will search the even earlier origin of Chinese
civilization and the recent discovery in Guchengzhai village is of
great importance to the research work.
</P>
<P>
Cai Quanfa, researcher with the Henan Archaeology Institute,
who also head the discovery work, said the large project of
constructing a city like this is rare in China's prehistoric
period and offers precious materials for the research on origin
and development of China's city construction.
</P>
<P>
Analysis on the relics show that the city walls were
constructed with advanced technique and they were so firm that
most of them still stand well today.
</P>
<P>
In the city, scientists also discovered relics of foundation of
a large palace and some buildings with corridors, which possibly
presented the high position and honor of the owner of the city.
Some specialists predicted that it might be the old capital of the
Yellow Emperor, the reputed ancestor of the Chinese nation, but
further proof was still needed.
</P>
<P>
Scientists also unearthed lots of ancient stoves, wells, house
foundations, tombs, and other production tools and household
articles in the city.
</P>
<P>
The experts plan to fully understand the structure of the city
in the following six to seven years and the protection work is
also on the way.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists confirmed after
examination that stone walls recently discovered in Luoyang city,
in central China's Henan province, was the relics of ancient Luohe
River banks.
</P>
<P>
On the north bank of the current Luohe River, running in the
western part of the province, scientists cleaned out about 400
meters of wall, built with square or rectangle-shaped stones and 0.
4 to 1.6 meters in height.
</P>
<P>
On the south bank, the relic wall is about 200 meters long and
two meters high. Both sides of the banks were believed to be
constructed in the Tang Dynasty (618-917) and the south bank was
rebuilt in later dynasties.
</P>
<P>
The discovery is crucial to the study on ancient Luohe River,
including hydrography, flood prevention, water transportation, and
even the city layout of ancient Luo Yang city.
</P>
<P>
Fostered by the Luohe River, the Luo Yang city was prosperous
then, and it used to be a world famous metropolis and a hub for
land and river transportation during the Tang Dynasty. Wu Zetian,
the only empress in China's history, lived here for most of her
life.

<HEADLINE> China Closes Representative Offices of Overseas Insurers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The China Insurance Regulatory
Commission (CIRC) has ordered the cancellation of three overseas
insurers' Beijing representative offices for violating the country
's insurance law and regulations.
</P>
<P>
The three companies are the U.S.-based Travelers Insurance
Group Inc., the Ping An Insurance (USA) Company Ltd. and the Hong
Kong-based Guijiang Insurance Agency Ltd., according to media
reports here today.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted CIRC officials as saying that the three
representative offices either changed their addresses without
approval or failed to submit their annual reports and that of
their companies, hence violating the CIRC's regulatory rules on
representative offices of overseas insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
The officials noted that representative offices in China by
overseas insurers have functioned a bridge for exchanges and
communications between sino-overseas insurance sectors, but some
of them have been ignoring Chinese regulators in their work and
violated regulatory rules repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
They added that CIRC would further step up its supervision over
representative offices in accordance with Chinese laws and
regulations.
</P>
<P>
According to CIRC figures, by the end of 1999, 113 overseas
insurance institutions from 17 countries and regions had opened
nearly 200 representative offices in 14 Chinese cities.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Set Up National Accreditation Board </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 13 (Xinhua) -- A National Accreditation Board (
NAB) is to be established shortly in Sri Lanka to assess the
credibility of organizations and individuals in the country, The
Daily News reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the NAB is a prerequisite for the
implementation of the national quality policy which has already
been drafted by a team of experts on quality management in
collaboration with officials of several state institutions with a
view to gaining excellence in economic and other activities.
</P>
<P>
"This will promote the country's goods and services at
international level," a senior official of the Sri Lankan Standard
Institution was quoted by the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
In Sri Lanka, more than 100 organizations are engaged in the
issue of test reports, certification services and training
activities. There are also individuals who are engaged in some of
these activities.
</P>
<P>
However, there is no national system to assess the credibility
of these organizations and the proposed NAB will fulfill that long-
felt need, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Among the objectives of the NAB are equal access for all
applicants and upgrading of criteria for accreditation in line
with international standards, he added.

<HEADLINE> Serious Drought Hits Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Romania is suffering the worst
drought in the past 50 years, which has withered 40 percent of the
crops and brought about a direct economic loss of 1.99 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The temperature has stayed at between 34 and 38 Celsius degrees
in the country since June with land face temperature running at as
high as 60 degrees.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry said
Monday that about 1.64 million hectares of farmland lack water.
Most of the crops in the eastern and southeastern parts is
expected to yield no harvest.
</P>
<P>
The weather department has forecast that the temperature will
continue to remain high and dry throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Local experts said that the agricultural production is set to
fall drastically this year because the aging and disrepair of the
water conservancy facilities can hardly offer any help to relieve
the drought.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese expert recently found that

</P>
<P>
The find brought impact to the medical circle immediately.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Pharmaceutical Factory Wins Trademark Dispute Against A German Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing Peidu Pharmaceutical
Factory becomes the winner of a five-year-long trademark dispute
against a German multinational company -- Parke-Davis GmbH.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing Peidu Pharmaceutical Factory finally has the right to
register its trademark formed by two Chinese characters and two
English letters -- "pd" -- in a logo form.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by the trademark examination and commenting
committee under the State Administration for Industry and Commerce.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1994 and in November of 1996, Parke-Davis GmbH
entrusted the Shanghai Office for Patent Trademark Affairs demur
against the trademark of the Chongqing factory.
</P>
<P>
The German company said the trademark "PD" it uses has been
registered internationally including China, and the logo "pd" used
by the Chongqing factory in its trademark is almost the same as
that of the "PD" trademark except the fact that one is written in
small letters and the other is capitalized.
</P>
<P>
The German company said consumers can be confused by such
trademarks because both of them are used on the commodities of the
same category.
</P>
<P>
The German company petitioned that the Chongqing factory's
trademark be revoked.
</P>
<P>
The Chongqing factory said its trademark is unitary and no part
of the trademark can be taken away.
</P>
<P>
The trademark examination and commenting committee said the
trademark of the German company is composed by capitalized,
interlaced and overlapped "PD" with a circle around them, which is
quite different with the trademark of the Chongqing factory, and
consumers can distinguish between them.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing Peidu Pharmaceutical Factory produces more than 20
varieties of prepared Chinese medicines, some of the products are
exported to Hong Kong, Taiwan and southeast Asian countries.

<HEADLINE> Australia Not to Intervene Militarily in Solomon Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer said Tuesday that he remains convinced non-
intervention is the correct way to handle the situation in the
Solomon Islands, the Australian Associated Press reported (AAP).
</P>
<P>
He believed that sending the military into the troubled
Solomons capital of Honiara would not help the situation. "I don't
think if we had intervened some months or weeks ago by sending in
police that would have resolved the situation at all," he said in
an interview with Australia's Channel Nine TV.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out, "I think this, first and foremost, has to be a
settlement negotiated by the parties within the Solomon Islands.
Then we can help to hammer it down, possibly as a Pacific
community by sending some people."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the parliament of the Solomon Islands is scheduled
to vote on a no-confidence motion against the house-arrested Prime
Minister Bartholomew Ulufa'alu on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Solomon Foreign Minister Patterson Oti said Tuesday that Ulufa'
alu will resign on Thursday to clear the way for a vote on a new
prime minister even if the motion is defeated in the parliament,
AAP reported.

<HEADLINE> IMF Begins Review of Indonesian Economic Reform Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- International Monetary Fund (IMF)
officials arrived here Monday for a 10-day review of Indonesia's
economic reform program that could pave the way for the next
disbursement from a 5 billion U.S. dollars loan.
</P>
<P>
"The focus of our review is on bank and corporate restructuring.
The framework is in place. Now the focus is making sure the
frameworks deliver results," Anoop Singh, deputy director of the
IMF's Asia and Pacific department, was quoted by The Indonesian
Observer Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the IMF released 372 million dollars from
the loan that had been held up since March. The delay was caused
by the Indonesian government's failure to implement key economic
reforms, such as pushing private companies to restructure 81
billion dollars in debt.
</P>
<P>
The IMF is scheduled to review Indonesia's economic progress
two more times this year and approve about 2 billion dollars as
part of a three-year loan. The next disbursement is slated for
July 31.

<HEADLINE> Two Rival Coalitions Win Local Elections in Montenegro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 12 (Xinhua)--- The two largest rival coalitions
have won local elections on Sunday in the Montenegrin capital of
Podgorica and in the coastal town of Herzeg Novi, respectively,
the official Yugoslav news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
According to ballots counted overnight, the coalition "For a
Better Life" led by the current Montenegrin President Milo
Djukanovic has won in Podgorica, while the opposition coalition "
Yugoslavia," which with the support of the Yugoslav Left and the
Serbian Radical Party is headed by Yugoslav Prime Minister Momir
Bulatovic, has emerged victoriously in Herzeg Novi.
</P>
<P>
In Podgorica, the coalition "For a Better Life" has won 50
percent of ballots, the coalition "Yugoslavia" nearly 40 percent,
and the Liberal Alliance 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The coalition "Yugoslavia" will have, most probably, 22 seats
in Podgorica parliament and the coalition "For a Better Life" 28
seats, with the remaining four seats likely to go to the Liberal
Alliance.
</P>
<P>
In Herzeg Novi, the coalition "Yugoslavia" won a convincing
victory with 19 of the total of 35 seats, which will dominate the
municipality.
</P>
<P>
The coalition "For a Better Life" will have 14 seats, while
the remaining two seized by the Liberal Alliance.
</P>
<P>
Montenegro's pro-Western president Djukanovic stands for
independence, but Bulatovic's side wants this tiny mountainous
republic to remain firmly in the federal embrace. The result of
the elections seems that the two sides are evenly matched.

<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economic expansion
has reached its peak, said a new analysis released Monday by an
American business-financed research group.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board's study indicated that the first quarter
of 2000 is likely to be the fastest growing period of the year,
with gross domestic product slowing from a year-to-year growth of
5 percent to 4.4 percent by the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
"More significant is the projected slowdown in U.S. market
growth from about 6 percent in the first quarter to between 4.5
percent and 5 percent by the fourth quarter," said Conference
Board chief economist Gail Fosler.
</P>
<P>
"Even at these growth rates, the Federal Reserve Board will be
disposed to raise short-term interest rates for the foreseeable
future. In this environment, business will encounter both top line
and bottom line pressure, with negative impact on profitability
showing up in the second half of the year," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board's Leading Economic Index also indicates
that the fastest U.S. growth rates were in the past. The Index
continues to rise but the pace has slowed markedly.
</P>
<P>
The share of the 10 components that are rising has slipped from
70-80 percent to 50 percent in the past two months. Every
component of the Index of Leading Economic Indicators is currently
growing at a significantly slower pace than six months ago, the
study shows.
</P>
<P>
First quarter GDP data reflect the striking dichotomy between
the growth of domestically provided goods and services and the
growth of total demand, said the Conference Board.
</P>
<P>
Domestic demand growth surged two percentage points from about
4 percent at the end of 1998 to a 6 percent annual rate at the
beginning of 2000, while output growth picked up from about a 4
percent annual rate to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The gap between demand and domestic supply did not widen over
the past six months, but overall activity levels are higher.
</P>
<P>
U.S. market growth averaged 7 percent between October 1999 and
March 2000, while GDP growth ran about 6 percent, which the
Conference Board said are inconsistent with price stability.
</P>
<P>
The expectation that these growth rates will slow as 2000
progresses is based on the slowing of demand growth due to
interest rate increases.
</P>
<P>
The demand surge in the U.S. has been driven by a boom in the
housing market that brings with it large increases in consumer
spending, the Board study said.
</P>
<P>
The house boom is the result of a combination of historically
low mortgage rates and a cyclical surge in real wage and salary
income in late 1998 and early 1999, both of which have now
subsided.

<HEADLINE> SOCOG Board Member Criticizes Lack of Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- A Sydney Organizing Committee for
the Olympic Games (SOCOG) board member said Tuesday the board has
not met for two months and is not involved in organizing the
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
John Valder said while the board was taking the blame for staff
firings and ticketing mistakes, it was not making the decisions
and often only found out about them by reading the newspapers.
</P>
<P>
"It is just such a strange way to run anything," Valder told
Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio. "If you don't actually want
to have a board meeting to consider the situation surely you at
least advise the board of what you are doing and why.
</P>
<P>
"But yet again all we members of the board do is read about it
in the newspapers."
</P>
<P>
He said board meetings have been scheduled less often as the
Sydney Games approach in September.
</P>
<P>
"The SOCOG board doesn't meet very often," said Valder. "I said
some time ago that I thought that as we moved into the year 2000
instead of having monthly board meetings maybe we'd have to come
to the point where they are held weekly.
</P>
<P>
"But the opposite has happened and the board meetings to be
held later this week is the first meeting for two months, would
you believe. So you see that the board quite clearly isn't running
the games."

<HEADLINE> Leukemia Sufferer Saved by Marrow from Taiwan Donator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, Jun 13 (Xinhua) -- A leukemia sufferer who received
marrow donated by a Taiwanese a month ago now recovered according
to full-scale indexes of hemogram.
</P>
<P>
Yao Meng, 25, was diagnosed leukemia last August and need
marrow transplant operation.
</P>
<P>
The transplantation requires the marrow of the donator and the
receiver to be accordant, the possibility of which is only one out
of 100,000 cases between ordinary people and about 30 percent to
40 percent between those born of the same parents.
</P>
<P>
Yao has no brothers or sisters, and no suitable marrow has been
found in mainland's marrow storage.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the efforts of Hemopathy Hospital of Chinese Academy
of Medical Sciences on the mainland and Tzu Chi Taiwan Marrow
Donor Registry, a proper young woman donator was found in Taiwan
eventually. The donator's marrow was drawn in the afternoon on
April 27 in Taiwan and the operation was carried out at 11:00 p.m.
on the same day in Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
It is said that one month after the marrow transplant operation
is a dangerous period due to bleeding or failure of liver and
kidney. So far, Yao has lived through the one month period with
positive signs and the recovery of his hematogenesis function is
also underway.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Complete a Genetic Linkage Map of Common Carp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists said recently
that they have already drawn a genetic linkage map of common carp,
making it possible for fostering new species of carp with some
good characters.
</P>
<P>
Researchers with Heilongjiang Branch of Chinese Academy of
Fishery Sciences crossbreed two species of carps and got the
individual of hybrid, from which they pick up haploid DNA and then
got the genetic linkage map after computer analysis on the DNA.
</P>
<P>
A genetic linkage map consists of all the DNA molecules of a
species marked and listed in a certain order. All 262 DNA
molecules including 178 gene markers were listed in 50 groups in
the genetic linkage map of carp.
</P>
<P>
Liang Liqun, scientist heading the research, said it is a good
map because from the map researchers can clearly see the DNA
molecules affecting carp's characters and their position in the
chromosome.
</P>
<P>
Liang also said that according to the research, carp's ability
of cold resistance rely on a kind of gene. Scientists have
successfully got six pairs of gene markers, which can enable
ordinary carp to resist cold effectively. Experts believe that
this is the first achievement in the circle in the world.

<P>
CHONGQING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Chongqing
Municipality has become the first city in China to import light
rail trains and technology from an American company for urban
passenger transportation, local officials have said.
</P>
<P>
The technology transfer will cost Chongqing 24 million U.S.
dollars, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
During the first phase of the Chongtianmen project, passenger
trains will take six minutes to carry up to 280 passengers in
seven carriages on the 2.6-km light rails over the Chongqing
section of the Yangtze River and Jialing River, traveling at a
speed of 60 km an hour.
</P>
<P>
The first stage project is expected to be completed by 2002.
The whole project needs an investment of 480 million yuan (about
58 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader Advocates Multipolar World, Raps NATO for Airstrikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 12 (Xinhua) -- China's top lawmaker Li Peng, in
an address to Yugoslavia's Federal Assembly on Monday, advocated
the establishment of a multipolar world and lashed out at the U.S.-
led NATO for the 87-day airstrikes against Yugoslavia last year.
</P>
<P>
In the address, Li, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress of China, said that today's world is in
a transition toward a structure of multipolarity.
</P>
<P>
"We advocate multipolarity, because multipolarity is better
than unipolarity, and multipolarity can embody the common
aspiration and interests of a majority of the nations and peoples
in the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, multipolarity also conforms to the intrinsic law of
the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that as international affairs are very complicated, it
is both harmful and impossible for only one country or a few
countries to dominate the world.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, the eventual formation of a structure of
multipolarity will be a long historical course, all countries in
the world should, through equal exchanges and dialogues among them,
enhance mutual understanding, diminish differences, expand
consensus, and seek for ways of peaceful co-existence, of seeking
common points while reserving differences and of mutually
beneficial development," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a megatrend of civilization and progress of the world,
" he stressed.
</P>
<P>
On the U.S.-led NATO's 87-day airstrikes against Yugoslavia
last year, the Chinese leader said, "On the eve of mankind's entry
into the 21st century, the U.S.-led NATO brazenly launched
airstrikes against the sovereignty country of Yugoslavia, staging
a gross violation of the internal affairs of Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
This act was in violation of the purpose of the United Nations
Charter and universally recognized norms governing international
relations, and seriously affected European stability and world
peace, he charged.
</P>
<P>
Regrettably, although that war is over, the issue of Kosovo has
not yet been solved, ethnic contradictions have not been eased,
the issue of refugees remains striking, and peace and stability in
the Balkans are far from realization, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"This is enough to indicate that bombs can never make peace,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
In that war, the United States used missiles to attack the
Chinese embassy in Belgrade, causing heavy casualties of personnel
and serious damage or destruction to the embassy buildings, Li
recalled.
</P>
<P>
"That was a rare and serious international illegal act in the
history of diplomacy of the world, which grossly violated the
sovereignty of China and greatly hurt the feelings of the Chinese
people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed gratitude to Yugoslavia for its assistance after
the embassy attack.
</P>
<P>
Li also reaffirmed that China always sticks to its independent
foreign policy of peace, upholds principles and justice in
handling international affairs, and is always a firm force for
safeguarding world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Also Monday, Li met here with Srdja Bozovic, Chairman of the
Chamber of Republics of the Federal Assembly, and Milomir Minic,
Chairman of Citizens of the Federal Assembly, to discuss bilateral
relations and exchange views on further strengthening the exchange
and cooperation between the National People's Congress of China
and the Federal Assembly of Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Gore Kicks Off "Progress and Prosperity Tour" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice-President Al Gore
kicked off a three-week "progress and prosperity tour" Tuesday to
get a share of the credit for the nation's strong economy.
</P>
<P>
The presumptive Democratic Party presidential candidate, who
began his tour from New York, said in a speech that "none of this
happened by accident." The tour will also take him to Pennsylvania
and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
"Together, as a nation, we turned the biggest deficits in our
history into the biggest surpluses in our history," said Gore.
</P>
<P>
"None of this happened by accident," he said. "It happened
because together with the American people we put into place a
brand new economic strategy, one that unlocked the full potential
of our people, balancing the budget, paying down the debt and
investing in the best enterprise of all: people, Americans
themselves."
</P>
<P>
Gore intends to promote the robust economy that has bloomed
since President Clinton took office and offer himself as the best
choice to ensure that it continues.
</P>
<P>
To emphasize his link with the Clinton administration economic
record, Gore invited Robert Rubin, former Treasury Secretary and
key architect of the Clinton administration's economic policy, to
join him for part of the tour.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Medicare, Gore intends to use his two-week tour
to call for targeted tax cuts, health care spending and
investments in education and job training.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said the "progress and prosperity" theme
reflects a new strategy by the Gore campaign, which had been
emphasizing what aides felt were the negative aspects of Gore's
Republican rival for presidency, Texas Governor George W. Bush.

<P>
The fire had settled down last night after charring 1,400
hectares, but a cold front brought renewed wind blowing at 25 kph
to 40 kph with gusts up to 70 kph.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 to 300 people remained out of their homes Tuesday in
the area near Bailey, some 55 kilometers southwest of Denver. The
houses are a mix of expensive second homes and modest frame and
modular buildings owned by people who work in the Denver area.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 180 girls and adults at a Girl Scout camp had been
cleared out as a precaution. Over 100 reinforcements arrived
Tuesday, joining some 300 firefighters already on the scene.
</P>
<P>
North of Denver, a second fire near a subdivision in the
mountains west of Loveland had burned at least two homes and
threatened as many as 200 others, according to the reports.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Government Tackles Damage by Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The serious drought became the
main issue tackled by the Romanian Government in its weekly
session on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Agriculture and Food Ioan Avram Muresan
presented a map of drought-stricken areas and areas where
irrigation is operational. Out of a total areas of 1,892,000
hectares ploughed with wheat, 480,600 hectares have so far been
damaged. Romania needs about 2,600,000 tones of wheat for bread-
making, which the specialists say can nevertheless be yielded,
even in excess.
</P>
<P>
Irrigation has been carried out on only 63,000 hectares, out of
a total area of 317,112 initially contracted to this end. Energy
prices for the pump stations of the irrigation system have been
state subsidized in whole, the National Society for Land
Improvement having so far used to this end 65 percent of the
allocated budget.
</P>
<P>
The Government's Executive Office analyzed some concrete
measures put forward by the Ministry of Agriculture in an attempt
to ensure water for the crops of maize, sun-flower, sugar beet,
vegetables, potatoes and fodder on an area of 800,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
Romania is suffering the worst drought in the past 50 years,
which has brought till now about a direct economic loss of 1.99
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The temperature has stayed at between 34 and 38 Celsius degrees
in the country since June with land face temperature running at as
high as 60 degrees. Most of the crops in the eastern and
southeastern parts is expected to yield no harvest.
</P>
<P>
The weather department has forecast that the temperature will
continue to remain high and dry throughout the country. Local
experts said that the agricultural production is set to fall
drastically this year because the aging and disrepair of the water
conservancy facilities can hardly offer any help to relieve the
drought.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Finance Minister Introduces Bank Reform Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Finance Minister Paul
Martin introduced the country's bank reform bill in Parliament
Tuesday to cater to "rapidly changing global environment."
</P>
<P>
The bill of about 900 pages has more than 20 amendments to
allow bank mergers as "a viable business strategy" while keeping a
complicated review process for any mergers between big banks.
</P>
<P>
"Essentially what we have done is to basically bring down
legislation that on the one hand will allow the banks to evolve to
meet competition, and at the same time protect consumers," said
the finance minister.
</P>
<P>
Under the bank reform measures, major banks must keep
headquarters in Canada with 75 percent of their boards made up of
Canadians.
</P>
<P>
Individual shareholders will be allowed to own 20 percent of
the voting shares, as compared with the current 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
While smaller banks with 5 billion Canadian dollars (about 3.4
billion U.S. dollars) in assets will be allowed to have
controlling shareholders, the country continues prohibiting any
one shareholder or group from controlling any major bank.

WASHINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The White House on Tuesday
hailed the historic summit between leaders of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea and South Korea as "extraordinarily
important," expressing the hope that the meeting would lead to
reduced tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung began on Tuesday a three-
day visit to the DPRK, the first of its kind in 55 years of the
peninsula's division, and received a warm welcome at the airport
by DPRK leader Kim Jong-il.
</P>

"I think the fact that the two leaders are meeting is
extraordinarily important," said White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
He said that "as far as the concrete results that may come out
of this session, I don't want to speculate in the first day of the
meetings, but it is quite important that these leaders are now
engaged in face-to-face discussions."
</P>
<P>
"It's impossible to predict at this point where these talks
will lead, but it's obviously an important step and an important
part of the process that they have been brought together in this
forum to have discussions directly," the spokesman added.

<HEADLINE> Czech Children Top European Average in Mathematics: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Czech children are among the best
in mathematics and natural sciences in Europe, the Czech News
Agency(CTK) quoted a latest report from the European Commission (
EC) as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report was drafted on the basis of 16 criteria, which have
been collected in 26 European countries since mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
A total of 66 percent of Czech 13 and 14-year-old students
passed mathematics tests, both groups exceeding the European
average. Among European Union (UN) countries only the Belgian
Flemish students are better in mathematics than Czechs, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Among EU candidates, Hungarians, Slovaks and Slovenians are
close to the knowledge of Czechs, the study added.
</P>
<P>
Czech pupils also showed above-average results in natural
sciences. According to the report, the Czech Republic ranks among
countries which teach informatics at school.
</P>
<P>
The report also indicates that the Czech Republic has the
lowest number of students who do not finish secondary school (ten
percent),compared to 40 percent of the Portuguese and 30 percent
of the British, Spanish, Italians and Luxembourgers.

<HEADLINE> Argentine President Apologizes for Harboring Nazi Criminals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Fernando de
la Rua on Tuesday asked the world to forgive his country for
harboring Nazi war criminals after the World War II.
</P>
<P>
"I want to asked forgiveness in the name of my country for the
Nazi criminals that entered the country and hid themselves among
us," De la Rua told a news conference here. He was in Washington
for a two-day state visit.
</P>
<P>
"Today, before the whole world, I want to express my sincerest
regret and say we are sorry that this happened," said the
Argentine president, who planned to lay a wreath in Washington's
Holocaust Museum later on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
After the World War II, Argentine received thousands of Germans,
including Adolf Eichmann, architect of the holocaust who directed
the murder of millions of European Jews, and Josef Mengele, the
concentration camp doctor known as the "Angel of Death" for his
experiments on prisoners.
</P>
<P>
De la Rue also pledged to get to the bottom of two anti-Jewish
bomb attacks in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, a car bomb destroyed the Israeli embassy in Buenos
Aires, killing 29 people. Two years later another car bomb
devastated a Jewish community center in Argentine, killing 86
people and wounding 200.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish community in Argentina is very concerned over the
two terrorist attacks and wants thorough investigation. And de la
Rua have moved to "reinvigorate" the probe by signing a decree on
Friday creating a special investigative unit to help a federal
judge investigate the crime.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to open new lines of investigation that could led to
other responsible people. We have partially uncovered the plot,
but there is a way to go still," the president said.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Files Notice to Appeal Breakup Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corp. on Tuesday
filed formal notice to appeal a federal judge's order that it be
divided into two separate companies for violating antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. has
agreed to hear Microsoft's appeal of the sweeping breakup order
imposed on it by District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson.
</P>
<P>
In a victory for the giant software maker in legal maneuvering
with the government, the court acted even before Jackson could
hear the government's request to bypass the circuit court and send
the case directly to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
The court said it was acting "in view of the exceptional
importance of these cases." Noting that three of its 10 judges are
disqualified from hearing the case, the court said all remaining
seven judges would hear the appeal.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft also said it had asked the U.S. Court of Appeals to
stay a raft of business restrictions ordered by Jackson as part of
his ruling last week.
</P>
<P>
Jackson on Tuesday sided with the U.S. Justice Department and
agreed to delay a decision on Microsoft's request to stay the
restrictions, saying the company needed to first give formal
notice of appeal.
</P>
<P>
The government, which says the company is trying to drag out
the case, said linking the two would force Microsoft's hand.
</P>
<P>
Justice is seeking to send the case on a fast-track to the U.S.
Supreme Court, bypassing the lower appeals court that has ruled in
Microsoft's favor in the past. Microsoft says it opposes going to
the Supreme Court and prefers the normal appeals route.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Rise On Slowing Retail Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks rose Tuesday
as new economic data showed evidence that the U.S. economy is
slowing and the Federal Reserve, therefore, would nearly end the
cycle of monetary tightening.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 57.63 at 10,621.84
and the technology heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 83.15 at 3,
851.06.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor'
s 500 index rose 23.44 at 1,469.44.
</P>
<P>
The market rallied after the Commerce Department reported that
U.S. retail sales in May dropped by a bigger-than-expected 0.3
percent, marking the second month in row in which retail sales
have fallen. The report gave new evidence that the U.S. economy is
slowing under the pressure of higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised rates six times since last June
in an effort to cool off the economy and keep inflation under
control. The higher rates have hit the stock market heavily.
</P>
<P>
The new data on the state of economy gave investors hope that
the Federal Reserve would remain on hold at the June 27-28 meeting
after its decisive 50 basis point move. Optimism about the rates
broke out of an early slump in the market after a Wall Street
investment firm cut its rating and earnings estimates for Hewlett-
Packard.
</P>
<P>
Investors were also encouraged by the remarks of the Federal
Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan. Addressing the New York
Association for Business Economics, Greenspan said  the
information technology has lifted the productivity of the American
workers.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 6.85 at 653.63 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 4.08 at 946.55. The Russell 2000 index of

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-5 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange with 1,735 up, 1,224 down and 458
unchanged.

<HEADLINE> S. African Official Calls for Cooperation to Fight Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 13 (Xinhua) -- While South Africa was
fighting to overcome poverty and underdevelopment, it could not do
so in isolation, Minister in the Office of the President Essop
Pahad said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a debate in the National Assembly on President
Thabo Mbeki's budget vote, Pahad said the challenges the country
faced had to be tackled with an awareness of regional, continental
and international implications.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot survive as an island of comparative well-being
surrounded by a sea of desperate want," he said.
</P>
<P>
What the government was doing locally should have a positive
ripple effect on the outside world, Pahad said.
</P>
<P>
"We must also seek support from our allies outside our own
narrow borders," he added.
</P>
<P>
Pahad said the presidency's budget vote was about addressing
the scourge of poverty, rooting out discrimination and attending
to long-neglected problems, such as those related to gender,
youth, the aged and the disabled.
</P>
<P>
"It is a vote about continuing a process which will eventually
lead to a significant redistribution of wealth in South Africa --
where life was, and in too many cases still is, over-comfortable
for the few and over- onerous for the many," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pahad said the most vulnerable casualties of poverty and
inequality were African women, particularly those in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
In dealing with the challenges of poverty and its effects on
the most vulnerable, the government could not merely offer
temporary support or welfare programs, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"We need radically to restructure society so that all our
fellow South Africans share the same human and socio-economic
rights," he said.

<HEADLINE> Mexico, Norway Back Greater Oil Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, June 13 (Xinhua)-- The governments of Mexico and
Norway favored Tuesday an increase of world oil production for
stability of crude prices.
</P>
<P>
The stance was expressed by Mexico's Secretary of Energy Luis
Tellez, and Norway's Petroleum and Energy Minister Olav Akselsen
at the end of a meeting in Oslo, said Mexico's Foreign Relations
Secretariat in a communique.
</P>
<P>
Tellez and Akselsen said at a joint press conference they'll
hold talks with their counterparts from other producing countries
for possible joint action, next week, to favor an increase in
offer.
</P>
<P>
Both officials said the market is tight and its stability
demands an effort from independent producers, and from
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
At a press conference set aside for a television channel,
Tellez declared trust that "prudence" prevails at OPEC, to which
Mexico doesn't belong.
</P>
<P>
According to Tellez, the increase of offer will stabilize
prices and keep world economy's dynamism.
</P>
<P>
OPEC will examine on June 21 in Vienna if it'll increase the
offer of a million additional daily barrels to the 2 million
increased last April. World extraction comes to 75 million daily
barrels.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said an offer increase will bring down prices. Crude
reached Monday in New York 31.74 dollars a barrel, its highest
price in the last three months.
