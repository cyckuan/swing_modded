 &HT;    Braves dim Mets' playoff chances
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As if last week's sweep in Atlanta wasn't bad enough,
the Braves have found new ways to crush Mets hearts.
</P>
<P>
   After blowing them out Tuesday night and teasing them by taking
a beating on Wednesday, the Braves came back to take this series
Thursday night with a 4-3 win in 11 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves walked out of Shea Stadium with homefield advantage
for the next two rounds of the playoffs while the Mets, who have
now lost eight of their last nine, may have kissed the postseason
goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   In case some of the formerly frenzied Mets fans didn't quite get
it _ that their team is two down in the wild-card race with three
games to go _ their favorite Brave issued a few parting words on
his way off the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them they could all go home and put their Yankee stuff
on,'' said Chipper Jones, hero of last week's series in Atlanta and
villain on Thursday night with an RBI single in the eighth. ``We
came in to win two out of three. Mission accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves tantalized the Mets and their 48,364 fans by allowing
them back from 2-0 and 3-2 deficits, one on a couple runs off Kevin
Millwood and the other on a home run off Mike Remlinger, but the
Braves kept coming.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jordan silenced the crowd with a triple off Octavio Dotel
to lead off the 11th inning as he wrong-footed Shawn Duston in
right field. After an intentional walk to Andruw Jones, Ozzie
Guillen drove Jordan for the winning run with a sacrifice fly to
center field.
</P>
<P>
   For the third time on a six-game road trip, Guillen played the
hero after beating the Expos with a 10th inning home run on Friday
night and again Saturday with a two-run RBI single. This one
brought the Braves their 17th extra inning win of the year, while
the Mets stuck on five.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to panic,'' Guillen said. ``I know what I can do
... I've hit the ball in the clutch all my career. I'm not saying
I'm the best clutch hitter, but I like to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves won their fifth consecutive series against the Mets
dating back through that sweep in the last three games of last
season in Atlanta, which knocked the Mets out of last year's
wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had wriggled out of a bases loaded jam that Jones
helped create in the eighth when Pat Mahomes came on to retire
Andruw Jones on a double play and Guillen on a flyout. Edgardo
Alfonzo then took Remlinger deep for his 26th home run of the
season to tie it 3-3. But that would be the last Mets hit of the
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, this game was symbolic of why we're where we
are,'' Remlinger said. ``That's typical of what we've done all
year, find a way to hang on. It's not the way you'd draw it up, but
it gets it done.''

 &HT;    Tech terminates Terps
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With a seemingly uncanny flair for the dramatic, Joe
Hamilton is making a serious run for the Heisman Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   And the No. 9-ranked Yellow Jackets needed every bit of
Hamilton's school-record 474 yards and four touchdowns to avoid
disaster and dust off Maryland 49-31 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Tech (3-1, 1-1 ACC) stayed within a Florida State loss of again
sharing the ACC lead, and it should remain in the top 10. But as
the Terrapins capitalized on the Jackets' season-long trend of
shoddy tackling, it appeared that few wins will come easy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Georgia Tech's defense had its moments.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, a Marvious Hester interception led to the touchdown
that sealed the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The defense started the game by pitching its first
opening-possession three downs-and-out of the season, and Sean
Gregory turned the excellent field position into a 48-yard scoring
dash on Tech's first play from scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   After Maryland converted a long kickoff return and two Tech
turnovers into a 17-14 lead late in the first half, the defense
twice gave the ball back to Hamilton &AMP; Co., who gave the Bobby Dodd
Stadium crowd plenty to shout about.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Uremovich and Nick Rogers threw LaMont Jordan for a 5-yard
loss on third down, and Hamilton put Tech in action at its 30 with
1 minute, 48 seconds left in the half. Twenty-seven seconds later,
Hamilton hit Dez White for a 29-yard score, his second of the half,
and the Jackets regained the lead for good.
</P>
<P>
   Another three-and-out and an 8-yard Maryland punt later, Tech
was at the Terps' 30. Hamilton then completed his school-record
257-yard passing half with a 30-yard scoring strike to Kerry
Watkins.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, who broke the 20-year-old record set by Mike Kelley
against Navy, completed 17 of 21 passes before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   With the game televised by ESPN, Hamilton boosted his Heisman
campaign with his second outstanding performance on national
television. In Tech's loss to Florida State on Sept. 11, shown on
ABC, he had five touchdowns, four passing and one rushing, and he
was 22 of 25 for 387 yards.

SPORTS COLUMN: ALL THE METS MAY WATCH FROM STANDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Six weeks ago, there was speculation that Masato
Yoshii would be dropped from the New York Mets' postseason roster.
This was based on the assumption _ credible at the time _ that the
Mets would actually make it to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he would do if the Mets could not find a spot for
him, Yoshi quipped _ and when was the last time a ballplayer
quipped anything, in English or Japanese or any language? _ ``If
I'm not on the roster, I'll buy a ticket in the stands.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he added, ``I'll have a beer and a hot dog, and I'll shout,
`Put in Yoshii.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nice line. Since then, the former Kintetsu Buffalo and Yakult
Swallow has been the Mets' most effective pitcher. Now it looks as
if Yoshii and all his teammates are going to be spectators when the
postseason begins early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Yoshii tried to keep his team in the race for
the wild card, pitching effectively into the seventh, but the
Braves finally put away the Mets, 4-3, in the 11th inning, putting
the Mets two games behind Cincinnati and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The sky over Shea Stadium was suddenly crisp and clear, and the
public-address system played ``Autumn in New York,'' but there was
nothing promising in this corner of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The once-promising season has turned on so many things that
there is no point harping on any one. Thursday night, there was the
indelible impression of Shawon Dunston, a career shortstop now
professionally willing to help in the outfield, turning the wrong
way on a long fly ball, turning it into a triple in the 11th
inning. The winning run scored, inevitably, a few pitches later.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, there was hope that the pitcher from the other side
of the world might keep the Mets close. Put in Yoshii, indeed.
Since returning to the rotation on Aug. 13, Yoshii had won five and
lost one in eight starts, and his earned run average was 1.63. On a
team with no ace, Yoshii had approximated one.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii's presence in such a vital game was a tribute to Bobby
Valentine, the manager who actually took Yoshii apartment-hunting
when the pitcher arrived in New York in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine added to his own angst last Saturday by volunteering
that if the Mets do not get into the playoffs he should be fired.
That notion has been knocked down by Fred Wilpon, one of the
owners, but Valentine has raised the issue, and it hangs there,
over his head.
</P>
<P>
   The manager does have his strengths, including an inquisitive
mind, that was expanded in his one year with Chiba Lotte of the
Japanese Pacific League. In the last two years, Valentine has shown
faith in Yoshii, 34, who did not come with great hyperbole, like
the Yankee owner calling Hideki Irabu the Nolan Ryan of Japan. But
Yoshii's jock's smile and chesty body language brought him
acceptance quickly last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My impression of him came from people I trust over there,''
Valentine said. ``I remember them talking about how competitive he
is. He showed some emotion. He was a little different.''
</P>
<P>
   From his year in Japan, Valentine understood that Yoshii could
be expected to accept authority, not necessarily the first thing
that comes to mind about American athletes. When the body count of
starters reached seven in August, Valentine knew he could afford to
send Yoshii to the bullpen without losing the pitcher's heart and
soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a matter of fair or unfair,'' Yoshii said. ``This
might be a Japanese way of thinking, but the manager is chief in
command. Whatever he decides is the law. You have to follow it.''
</P>
<P>
   Having helped win the Japanese World Series in 1997, Yoshii had
done it all in his own country. Now he had hopes of pitching the
Mets deep into the North American version of the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Yoshii gave up single runs in the fourth and
fifth innings and the bullpen held until the eighth, when the
Braves went up, 3-2. Then Edgardo Alfonzo made the biggest clutch
hit the Mets have had since their totally fruitless trip to Atlanta
and Philadelphia, a two-out homer that tied the game. Then the
gallant Dunston turned the wrong way, and so did the season.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii can drink beer and eat hot dogs and sit in the stands
during the postseason, but he'll have to go to another ballpark to
do it. The Mets are not going to survive their ill-timed walkabout.

A NIGHT FOR GIULIANI TO PAY TRIBUTE TO THE REAGAN LEGACY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SIMI VALLEY, Calif. _ New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani on
Thursday night wrapped himself in the legacy of Ronald Reagan in a
speech that glorified the 40th president and seemed an unusual
approach for an unannounced Senate candidate who would need
Democratic votes to win in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   In delivering the annual Reagan Lecture at the Ronald Reagan
Presidential Library here, Giuliani called Reagan one of the two
most important presidents of the 20th century _ the other being
Franklin D. Roosevelt _ and ``a force for good in the world.''
Giuliani praised Reagan's supply-side economics, which Democrats to
this day say caused the huge deficits of the 1980s and favored the
rich. ``Who says that supply-side economics doesn't work?'' said
Giuliani. ``Of course it works.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Giuliani said he was attaching great importance to the
speech, which in its lengthy discourse on foreign policy seemed
more presidential than senatorial in its ambitions. Aides also said
that Giuliani viewed it not so much as a campaign speech as a
tribute to the former president in his twilight years. Giuliani
reveres Reagan, and served in his two administrations as associate
attorney general and U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The annual lecture was created by the Ronald Reagan Presidential
Foundation to honor ``conservative public figures or
policy-makers'' who ``reaffirm and apply the principles that guided
the president and shaped his enduring legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   An official at City Hall acknowledged that there were some
political considerations to the speech, and said that it could help
with those voters upstate and in the suburbs who may distrust the
mayor of New York City but have fond feelings for the president who
gave birth to the term the Reagan Democrat. Giuliani himself
pointed out at a fund-raiser at the Beverly Hills Hotel on
Wednesday that Reagan carried New York state in both the 1980 and
1984 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   The speech's Republican orthodoxy also outlined the themes of
the battle that Giuliani is almost certain to fight against Hillary
Rodham Clinton, his likely opponent in next year's Senate race.
Giuliani told the audience of 450 Reagan faithful, who interrupted
his speech several times with applause, about how he had reduced
the welfare rolls in New York City and believed in ``freedom of
choice'' in education. In praising Reagan for returning powers to
state and local governments, Giuliani in part credited the former
president for his own election as mayor, an event that Giuliani
sees as pivotal to the city's resurgence. Without Reagan, Giuliani
said, there might have been ``no innovative governors _ and maybe
there'd be no Republican mayor of New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   Reagan, 88, has Alzheimer's disease and did not attend the
lecture. Nancy Reagan, the former first lady and a trustee of the
Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation, , served as the host. The
day before, she welcomed Sen. tor John McCain, R-Ariz., on a stop
of his presidential campaign. In his speech Giuliani said Mrs.
Reagan was the one person aside from the former president who is
``most responsible for the Reagan legacy that we celebrate
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani spent a large part of his speech praising Reagan for
ending the Cold War and building up America's defenses. He also
criticized President Clinton for a foreign policy of ``confusion''
and a weakened military. ``The next president,'' Giuliani said,
``will have to rebuild American foreign policy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In remarks to reporters before the lecture, Giuliani said he had
not yet read Edmund Morris' new authorized biography of Reagan,
``Dutch,'' which paints the president in his second term as an
out-of-touch loner who was often in his pajamas in the White House
family quarters watching television by 6 p.m. ``I only read the
prologue,'' Giuliani said. ``Let me read the book first before I
comment on it.''
</P>
<P>
   After the speech at the Mission-style library with its distant
view of the Pacific Ocean, Giuliani went with Mrs. Reagan and such
Reagan friends as Betsy Bloomingdale and Charles and Mary Jane Wick
to dinner at the nearby Sherwood Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's speech came at the end of a three-day fund-raising
and political trip to Washington, D.C., Las Vegas and California.
Thursday morning Giuliani played golf on the lush course of palm
trees and oleander at the Stockdale Country Club in Bakersfield,
then spoke at a lunchtime fund-raiser in the clubhouse dining room.
As has happened throughout this trip, one of the guests asked him
about the status of the city's battle with the Brooklyn Museum of
Art over an exhibition that Giuliani has termed ``disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's responses to the question have grown increasingly
descriptive. In Washington he extensively described a sliced pig in
formaldehyde, calling it ``a biology experiment at best.'' In
Stockdale on Thursday, he said the entire exhibit ``belongs in a
psychiatric ward.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the first day of his retooled campaign, Vice
President Al Gore spent a day much like any other. He addressed
corporate officials in New York City, walked the streets of a
depressed, upstate town, and returned to the city to meet with
reporters and then financial contributors for his second
fund-raiser in as many days.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday marked Gore's first foray outside Washington after
announcing his plans on Wednesday to revitalize his presidential
campaign by moving his headquarters from Washington to Tennessee
and by holding smaller, more intimate events that would, as he put
it, get him closer to the people.
</P>
<P>
   He repeated that theme Thursday morning, saying he would take
his campaign ``from K Street in Washington to the aisles of K-Mart
in Nashville.'' Chris Lahane, his press secretary, said Gore did
not mean to imply he would be running a cut-rate campaign, only
that he would be spending more time with ``real'' people and less
time with Washington insiders.
</P>
<P>
   A sense of frugality was an important message to convey as it
became clear Thursday that Gore had raised less money in the last
three months and had less cash on hand than his sole Democratic
challenger, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   But there was little Thursday to indicate that Gore had pared
down his campaign, but he did try to break out from the trappings
of the vice presidency, plunging in the crowds in midtown Manhattan
and shaking hands, lingering, much like President Clinton. At one
point, he grabbed a cell phone from a bystander and said, ``Hi,
this is Al Gore'' to the person on the other end of the line. But
he still traveled in a lengthy motorcade.
</P>
<P>
   And he made his comment about K-Mart on the 56th floor of a Park
Avenue office tower to about 200 chief executives, a group that
would probably be more comfortable in the offices of lobbyists on
Washington's K Street than in K-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   And except for his stroll around a couple of blocks of
Amsterdam, N.Y., where he shook hands with unemployed residents in
the shadow of a closed toy factory, Gore stuck to traditional
venues and sounded his traditional themes of universal child care,
stronger public education and spreading economic prosperity to all
corners of the country..
</P>
<P>
   The formats that he chose generated little of the fanfare that
often accompanies presidential campaigns. That was especially true
of his visit to Amsterdam, a town of old rug mills that converted
to making toys and then went out of business, where he met with
residents and then led an hourlong forum on reviving depressed
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Walking along Grand Street and First Avenue in Amsterdam, he
stopped and chatted with residents who had come out on their front
stoops.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Choat, 26, a laid-off worker from a nearby plant, said of
Gore: ``I earned a lot of respect for him because he talked to
us.'' Dave Passafiume, 33, who is unemployed and finds Amsterdam
``dead,'' was less enthusiastic. ``I can't find a job,'' he said,
adding that he thought few politicians could really make a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo accompanied
Gore and announced grants of $300,000 to help Amsterdam. Cuomo said
later that the purpose of their visit _ trying to spark economic
revitalization _ did not lend itself to typical campaign
excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bad-news topic, the upstate economy,'' Cuomo said.
``The basic message is, `We have a real problem to deal with.'''
</P>
<P>
   Those who met Gore were pleased nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came right to us, and that makes a significant
difference,'' said Elizabeth DeBella, 36, a nurse from nearby
Schenectady.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, the New Yorkers who met Gore had a good
impression of him as well. Leon Wagner, an investment banker, saw
him at the Sky Club on Park Avenue. ``He is so much better in
person,'' Wagner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason that myself and friends are going to get behind the
vice president now is _ I work on Wall Street _ it's a little like
getting behind a stock that's a little soft,'' Wagner said. ``The
perception is that Bradley is on an uptick, but the fact is the
vice president has experience. And frankly, I'm not willing to vote
against the prosperity that we have.''
</P>
<P>
   At a fund-raiser in New York City, Gore drew about 300 people
and raised $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of focusing on issues, Gore talked about himself.
Recalling the Vietnam War, in which he served after enlisting in
the Army, Gore said: ``I became completely disillusioned with
America. I saw my country go into a long, dark tunnel called the
Vietnam War, and I felt my country being torn apart by the seams.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was ridiculed when he returned home and wore his
uniform. ``I felt hatred from my fellow Americans,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   His career in journalism, Gore said, helped him reconnect with
what he called the ``American spirit.''

SANTA CLARITA, CALIF., SEEKS TO PROMOTE TOURISM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON TAKENOUCHI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- William S. Hart Museum and Gallagher's Old Town
Restaurant may not rate a mention in most Southern California
tourist guides, but the Santa Clarita Valley landmarks will soon be
famous if the city of Santa Clarita gets its way.
</P>
<P>
   The museum and restaurant are part of a tourism push beginning
Friday that will take travel agents from Southern California and
Arizona on a tour of the valley's sights. City boosters hope the
inaugural event -- which also includes better-known sites such as
Six Flags California -- will help valley businesses grab a bigger
piece of the region's tourist industry.
</P>
<P>
   They are in for a challenge. This former bedroom community has
never had a large tourist base beyond Six Flags visitors, and the
valley's offerings include few Hollywood-caliber assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has always been sort of a void for us,'' said Laurie
Lincoln, president of Main Street Tours Inc. of suburban Torrance.
``I think of it more as suburban and Magic Mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   Travel coordinator Jason Teng of Los Angeles-based Tour America
Inc. said most of his clientele _ tourists from Southeast Asia and
Hong Kong _ think of Santa Clarita as a one-item destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Magic Mountain is the only thing I know that's located in the
Santa Clarita Valley,'' said Teng, one of 10 travel professionals
who will take the city's three-day tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city itself is wonderful, and it's enough to draw people
from the Southern California area,'' he said. ``But for tourists
from Asian countries, we still have to sell it.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Karp, the newly appointed head of the city's tourism
effort, acknowledged that Santa Clarita lacks the volume of
headliner attractions that its larger southern neighbors enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent addition of an IMAX theater and the expansion
of Six Flags, Karp said much of Santa Clarita's allure lies in its
less-prominent, and less-crowded, assets.
</P>
<P>
   The city's tour highlights many of those attractions, including
the Castaic Lake recreation area and the hilltop museum dedicated
to frontier movie hero William S. Hart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the tourists don't want to be with other tourists,''
Karp said. ``They want to be isolated and away from all the traffic
that L.A. has.''
</P>
<P>
   And the same factors that draw residents to the valley _ low
crime and clean streets _ may also work to the valley's advantage,
Karp said.
</P>
<P>
   The city is also expanding the concept of the Santa Clarita
Valley by including in its listing of attractions several sites in
neighboring Ventura County's Fillmore and Santa Paula, cities in
their own right that aren't even in the same county as Santa
Clarita.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clarita has not yet compiled statistics on how many people
visit, what they spend or where they go. And Karp said they are
waiting on the results of this weekend's tour to help them shape a
strategy about which tourists to target and how to target them.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the infrastructure is already in place, however,
including a toll-free number _ (800) 718-TOUR _ that rings directly
into the Santa Clarita Valley Chamber of Commerce. The chamber ran
the area's tourism bureau until August, when the city took the
campaign under its umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   After this weekend's tour, Karp said the bureau's top priority
will be to obtain state and federal funding that'll help make Santa
Clarita a household name. The bureau is funded with private
contributions and a matching grant from the city.
</P>
<P>
   Karp said the city has not yet decided if it will partner with
tourism efforts in the San Fernando Valley or Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But some kind of cooperation is likely, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tourism industry altogether is moving away from
competition,'' she said. ``It's more beneficial for us to partner
together.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's effort to promote attractions outside its immediate
area drew praise from Kathy Janega-Dykes, executive director of the
Ventura Visitors and Convention Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a win-win situation for us all,'' she said. ``It
absolutely makes sense.''

A DUBIOUS HEALTH-CARE PROPOSAL 
</HEADLINE>
 (Editors: Subs to add byline-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER

<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Bradley is finally getting the hang of how he can use
budget-surplus politics to boost his presidential fortunes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bradley proposes a $65-billion-a-year plan to make health care
available to nearly all uninsured Americans. His plan, he says,
wouldn't require new taxes, but could be financed with future
budget surpluses. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While those extra revenues are estimated at about $1 trillion
over the next decade, fiscal forecasts are notoriously unreliable.
As recently as the early '90s, for instance, experts were
predicting budget deficits of $400 billion or more by the end of
this decade. Instead, this year's surplus is now being estimated at
$115 billion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A recession could put Uncle Sam back into the red, but even if
the surplus forecasts hold up, there are cautionary considerations
to ponder. One is that most, if not all, of the projected surpluses
will be excess revenues from the payroll taxes paid to fund Social
Security. As that money is spent, it will represent nothing more
than borrowing from Peter's Social Security pot to pay for
uninsured Paul's medical-care coverage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, it should be remembered that initial cost estimates
of proposed government programs always turn out to be much lower
than the eventual financial reality. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bold new programs offered by candidates, however, aren't much
about details, which are bothersome things that can't be explained
in 30-second sound bites on the evening news. Going beyond the
dubious nature of Bradley's financing plan are the daunting details
of how such a program would improve the lives of those it's
supposed to help. Bradley said, for instance, that his plan would
require health insurance coverage for all uninsured children, but
offered no mechanism to enforce the enrollment of these children in
coverage plans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to trust in the basic goodness of the American
people,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's a touching sentiment, but it's based on a heroic
assumption. Bradley may not appreciate how real life works, but
there are many Americans who may be basically good people but are
nevertheless highly irresponsible. They don't order their lives to
be ready for problems when they happen, but instead choose to wait
for bad things to happen before reacting. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another probable consequence of Bradley's plan would be to
increase demand for medical care. Just as there are people who
don't take proper care of themselves and their children, there are
also people who view insurance coverage as justification for
seeking medical care for every real and imagined hurt and
discomfort, no matter how minor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whether Bradley is thinking in terms of fee-for-service or
managed care, the outcome of ratcheting up use of the health-care
system by 45 million users will be the same: More demands on a
system already in a rationing mode. Many Americans may not be aware
of it, but when government trims its Medicare reimbursements to
providers, and companies seek ways to economize on employee
health-care benefits, as has been the case, these are forms of
rationing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Budget-surplus politics, however, aren't about truth or reality,
but about gulling voters into thinking they can have more goodies
from government without having to pay for them. &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Wanted for a millennium New Year's Eve bash:
2,000 line dancers at Van Nuys Airport, 2,000 gospel singers in the
Crenshaw district, 2,000 Mexican folk dancers for Olvera Street,
2,000 marching band members for downtown and 2,000 drummers for San
Pedro.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of a plan announced to bring in the 21st Century
with a $4.2 million privately funded celebration around the city
that will end with the New Year's countdown and lighting of the
Hollywood sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York has the Statue of Liberty, Paris has the Eiffel
Tower, and we have our own world symbol with the Hollywood sign,''
Mayor Richard Riordan said at the Griffith Park Observatory
overlooking the sign.
</P>
<P>
   With skywriters spelling out ``LA 2000. CU-12/31'' and skydivers
floating down with a giant flag, Riordan and co-chairpersons Andy
Garcia and Paula Abdul outlined a daylong schedule of festivities
Thursday that officials hope will attract up to 100,000 people at
five locations and involve the entire city in some event.
</P>
<P>
   All of the events will be linked by giant screens showing what
is going on in different parts of the city. And, that night, the
screens will also feature excerpts of the concert being staged by
the Eagles at downtown Los Angeles' new Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day on Dec. 31, there will be an air parade of
skywriting, sky divers, hot air balloons and airplane displays,
said Cultural Affairs Director Al Nodal.
</P>
<P>
   The five main events will be held at Van Nuys Airport, Olvera
Street, Baldwin Hills-Crenshaw Plaza, Grand Avenue and the San
Pedro harbor area.
</P>
<P>
   At Van Nuys Airport, the event will begin at noon and will be
called ``The Family Global Millennium,'' featuring the different
cultures in the community. The city will recruit 2,000 line dancers
to entertain the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guinness, get your world book out,'' said Abdul, who is
helping coordinate some of the choreography.
</P>
<P>
   Similar events will be held at different locations, featuring
different entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets will be required for the events and will be distributed
free by selected grocery and stores.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said all religious institutions in the city have been
asked to participate with bell ringings at noon, 4 p.m., 9 p.m. and
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Also that night, a private event called Made in Hollywood will
be held at Paramount Studios, with a goal of raising $1 million for
the Los Angeles Public Library literacy program.
</P>
<P>
   The night will be capped with the lighting of the Hollywood
sign.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan said the idea for using the sign came from actress Geena
Davis in a conversation he had with her several months ago. ``She
said, Why not use the sign that most symbolizes Los Angeles?''
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for limiting public access to the televised event,
which will feature a countdown of the nine letters and then Riordan
flipping a switch to begin a laser light show.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is happy with the plans. Henry Pinczower of the
Hollywoodland Homeowners Association said his group is looking at
different options to try to stop that event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still talking about a few things but won't comment
until we have a final plan,'' Pinczower said. ``We are concerned
that this will be a pretty wild night with the potential for a lot
of inebriated people trying to come up here.''

CHINA ORCHESTRATES NATIONAL CELEBRATION OF 50 YEARS OF COMMUNISM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (replaces 5th graf with 4 new grafs on prominent role of Jiang and
other details)  (bl) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China celebrated the 50th anniversary of Communist
rule Friday, orchestrating a nationwide festival of patriotic pride
that presented a seamless-looking display of political unity and
popular happiness.
</P>
<P>
   With a grand parade rolling into central Beijing on Friday
morning, crowned by gleaming new missiles, shiny tanks and gaudy
floats, China's leaders put together a show intended to project a
jubilant manifestation of national strength and harmony. A
temporary state of martial law in much of Beijing ensured that the
event was cheered on by hundreds of thousands of pre-arranged
onlookers.
</P>
<P>
   If Friday's party demonstrated the government's resilient
organizational skills more than any genuine national strength, the
celebration was so huge _ with 500,000 participants _ and was
perceived by the authorities as so critically important that it
became a significant political event in itself.
</P>
<P>
   President Jiang Zemin presided Friday, and the festivities might
as well have been called ``Jiang's Show.'' After months of
groundwork, Friday's parade crowned Jiang's efforts to lift himself
to the same historical plane as China's two great modern leaders,
Mao Tse-tung and Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 90 floats in Friday's parade _ a remarkable collection
glorifying China's achievements, like one with people dressed as
happy fruits and vegetables that are now available _ were separate
portraits of Mao, Deng and Jiang, the first time the current leader
has been placed on a par with his predecessors in such a public
way.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang stood alone in an open-backed limousine that reviewed a
miles-long line of military hardware, one of many pieces in
Friday's festivities that looked distinctly reminiscent of former
communist regimes in Russia and Eastern Europe, now all gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comrades, hello!'' Jiang yelled to the assembled troops, who
included camouflage-green-clad marines, blue-suited air force
officers and militia women in red miniskirted uniforms. ``You are
working hard!''
</P>
<P>
   Though he looked tentative and uncertain as he stepped to the
rostrum at Tiananmen _ the Gate of Heavenly Peace _ and remained
dour and unsmiling, Mr. Jiang was clearly meant to appear firmly in
charge. Alone among China's top leaders Friday, Jiang wore a Mao
suit.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 1 will long be remembered in China for the day 50 years ago
when Mao stood atop Tiananmen _ the imperial Gate of Heavenly Peace
_ and proclaimed that the Chinese people had finally stood up,
after decades of civil war and foreign invasion. The last major
Oct. 1 celebration had been staged on the 35th anniversary, in
1984, to celebrate Deng's rule and his program for economic growth,
and Friday was clearly intended to mark Jiang's turn in the
pantheon.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 50 years of trials and tribulations, all the people of
the country must unite even more tightly around the Party center
with Jiang Zemin as its core,'' said the Beijing Youth Daily in a
typical hymn to the leader.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to many Chinese, Jiang displays no vision or charisma worthy
of Mao or Deng, nor does he even seem to believe in the Communist
ideology that he still talks about in public. He often seems to
symbolize the government's confused stance on its most basic issue:
should China be Communist or capitalist?
</P>
<P>
   For anyone taking the 50th birthday as a time to consider broad
historical trends, China's direction seems clear: Communist
authority is being slowly but inexorably undermined each day by the
twin forces of money and information, the same dynamic powers that
have invaded other countries with a maturing economy.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders often remark at the seemingly peaceful coexistence of
Communist Party rule and burgeoning capitalism. Yet a quiet battle
is actually under way all over this country, visible on any street
corner in Beijing where McDonald's restaurants or mobile-phone
stores signal the arrival of hard-to-control entities in China.
</P>
<P>
   It is also evidenced in countless instances where government
officials are forced to confront their gradual loss of control over
many fields, such as the Internet. Recently, Information Industry
Minister Wu Jichuan abruptly announced a ban on foreign investment
in Internet-related companies, a potentially devastating step
backward.
</P>
<P>
   His ministry has spent years building telecommunications
equipment, and the country's leaders have said that they want to
embrace the Internet as a critical tool for Chinese companies and
researchers and students. Yet if it is carried out, China's young
Internet industry, and many of its best entrepreneurs, may feel
forced to work abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In China's media, the 50th anniversary has been occasion to
release, under the pretense of a consideration of history, long
strings of praise and seemingly mindless slogans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The course of 50 years of struggle tells us that only
socialism can save China,'' said the Communist Party newspaper
People's Daily in an editorial Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The party's claim to national strength and tranquility are
belied by tough limits on freedom of speech or assembly, rights
that are spelled out in China's constitution, particularly about a
political issue as sensitive as Oct. 1 itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were told what to print,'' said a Shanghai newspaper
editor, referring to coverage of the Oct. 1 celebrations. ``There
was no discussion, no variation, no room to change anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many Chinese, this editor said he was indifferent to the
holiday, although he was glad that the authorities gave office and
factory workers an entire week off. Few of his friends, the editor
said, were likely to give much thought to whether there is any
deeper meaning in Communist China's 50th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The reason that the government awarded extra vacation days
appears to have been to compensate many people for troubles
incurred by organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of Beijing, for example, was put under martial law
to insure a smooth operation of Friday's proceedings, a reminder of
how anything as basic as freedom of movement is still secondary to
the vanity of the nation's leaders. Leaving little to chance, the
authorities ordered shut every window facing Beijing's main avenue,
and blocked some residents from leaving their homes for two days.
</P>
<P>
   Tibet Information Network, a London-based human rights group,
reported that Tibetans in Lhasa have been told that their pay or
pensions would be cut if they failed to take part in rehearsals for
anniversary celebrations.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ In the worst accident in Japan's troubled history with
nuclear power, an out-of-control chain reaction at a fuel
fabrication plant near Tokyo spewed high levels of radiation into
the air beginning Thursday morning. Thirty-five people were
exposed, three of whom were seriously injured, and 300,000 local
residents were ordered to stay indoors. The reaction was brought
under control early Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the reaction was set off when workers
accidentally poured 35 pounds of uranium into a purification tank
containing nitric acid, instead of the 5.2 pounds normally used.
</P>
<P>
   This mistake reportedly caused a flash of blue light inside the
plant, owned by Sumitomo Metal Mining Co. Scientists said the flash
may have been the result of a fast chain reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo Electric Power Co. rushed 880 pounds of sodium borate to
the plant, but the authorities said they had no way of getting
close enough to the processing tank to dump the radiation-absorbing
powder onto it.
</P>
<P>
   When initial efforts to stop the reaction failed, the government
ordered residents of areas near the plant, in the town of
Tokaimura, to stay indoors. A primary school, a kindergarten, a
number of shops and several homes were all located within the
affected area.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the day Thursday, the government made little fuss
about the accident, closing off a three-mile perimeter around the
area and warning residents to keep their windows shut. By late
Thursday evening, the East Japan Railway, which serves the area,
suspended train traffic to the immediate region of the accident.
Major highways into the town were also closed, and electronic signs
were posted on small roads warning motorists to avoid the area. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The restrictions remained in effect Friday and residents of the
immediate area were further cautioned to avoid contact with well
water or rain water. A light rain was falling Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have said nothing so far about the possibility of
airborne or waterborne radiation contaminating other areas, nor
have they addressed the long-term impact of the radiation that
escaped.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, who was scheduled to name a new
cabinet Friday but was forced by the incident to postpone the
change in government, apologized tacitly for the slow official
reaction. ``We must obtain decisions from scientists, technicians
and experts'' to assess such accidents, the prime minister told
reporters at his residence, according to the Kyodo news agency,
adding ``if they were slow in making decisions, we must make sure
that that never happens again.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Japan has compounded other nuclear accidents with
similarly slow, and often misleading, information given to the
public. Commentators here are already predicting a strong backlash
in public opinion against the industry and perhaps too against a
deeply embarrassed government.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The confused emergency response has been matched by a confused
political one, with rival agencies alternately seeking to dismiss
concerns about Japan's vast nuclear energy program, or calling for
a sweeping reevaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Early Friday, the chief of the government's Natural Resources
and Energy Agency, Hirobumi Kawano, still ruled out the idea that a
``criticality,'' or uncontrolled reaction, could occur at a nuclear
power plant in Japan, and told reporters that he did not intend to
instruct power companies to re-examine their safety measures, Kyodo
reported.
</P>
<P>
   A top official of the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry, however, said the accident was serious enough to lead
Japan to reconsider its nuclear power policy. Japan operates 51
nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
   Officials requested the assistance of U.S. military forces in
Japan to handle the accident. According to the Japan Self-Defense
Agency, the government was informed that U.S. forces here are not
equipped to deal with nuclear accidents.
</P>
<P>
   In Sarov, Russia, where he is on a study mission, U.S. Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson said that Russia and the United States
were prepared to send nuclear specialists to help Japan if Tokyo
asks for assistance. ``So far, the Japanese have only asked us for
information,'' said Richardson in an interview. ``But I've spoken
to our Russian counterparts, and my department and Russia's
Ministry of Atomic Energy both stand ready to send a joint team
almost immediately to help Japan with this tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese television network NHK said early Friday morning
that after repeated failed attempts to drain the tank by remote
control, emergency workers deliberately broke pipes leading to the
purification chamber, allowing it to cool. Workers were attempting
to insert hoses into the contaminated area to drench it with
special chemicals to absorb the radiation.
</P>
<P>
   In an indication that the accident was being brought under
control Friday, Japanese television said that at 6:30 a.m., the
Science and Technology Agency reported that no radiation could be
detected at 14 monitoring sites around the plant. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to the Japanese Atomic Energy Research Institute,
measurements of radiation levels at the plant were reported to have
been from 10,000 to 20,000 times the normal levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an intense situation in which there is concern over the
continued effects of radiation,'' Obuchi told an emergency task
force named late Thursday to oversee handling of the accident. ``We
must make certain to prioritize the safety of the residents.''
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi's chief cabinet secretary, Hiromu Nonaka, said Thursday
night that units of Japan's Self-Defense Forces chemical warfare
unit were being dispatched to the site of the fuel fabrication
plant at Tokaimura, 87 miles northwest of Tokyo, but said that
Japan was ``not capable of dealing with this kind of nuclear
accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonaka called the runaway reaction, known as a ``criticality
event'' in the jargon of the nuclear power industry, ``something
that Japan has never experienced.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials were meeting on the matter Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Initial reports said that only three workers had been injured at
the site, and had been taken by helicopter to a hospital that
specialized in nuclear-related illnesses in Chiba prefecture to the
east of Tokyo. Later, two of the workers were reported to be in
serious condition, and a doctor involved in their treatment said
that all three of those initially reported injured had been exposed
to ``a quite substantial amount of radiation.'' One is in critical
condition and has not recovered consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   As it became apparent late Thursday that the accident had still
not been brought under control, more and more reports of
radiation-related injuries trickled in. By dawn, authorities said,
at least 35 people had been contaminated, including workers at a
neighboring site, and the paramedics who helped evacuate the three
workers who were initially injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``A major accident resulting in a radioactive leak has
happened,'' said Koji Kitani, president of JCO Co. ``We apologize
from the bottoms of our hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   The town of about 33,000 resident where the accident occurred,
Tokaimura, is home to more than a dozen nuclear-type plants, and
was the site of Japan's worst previous nuclear accident, in 1997.
In that incident, 37 workers were exposed to radiation after a fire
in one of the plants was improperly extinguished and caused a small
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking domestic petroleum resources, Japan heavily pushed the
development of nuclear energy in the 1970s, following the oil
shocks of that decade. The result is that the country is now
dependent upon nuclear power for about one-third of its electricity
needs, among the highest of any country. The fuel made at the plant
where the accident occurred is used in nuclear reactors nearby.
</P>
<P>
   This familiarity with nuclear power has not allowed Japan to
avoid accidents, however, and in recent years, nuclear safety has
increasingly become a major political issue for the public.
</P>
<P>
   In July, radiation estimated to be 11,500 times higher than
normal levels leaked out of faulty pipes in a nuclear reactor in
the town of Tsuruga, about 200 miles west of Tokyo. During that
accident, a reactor owned by Japan Atomic Power Co. was forced to
shut down after losing 51 tons of its radioactive water coolant.
The Tsuruga plant remains closed for repairs. During that accident,
a reactor owned by Japan Atomic Power Co. was forced to shut down
after losing 51 tons of its radioactive water coolant. The Tsuruga
plant remains closed for repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's issue of Mainichi Shimbun quoted outraged members of
the government's Nuclear Safety Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Kenji Sumida said, ``I know that this is difficult to believe,
but I think that we have no choice but to recognize this accident
as having been critical.''
</P>
<P>
   Another member, Kazuo Sato, speaking of the reports of employee
error, said, ``If they had done their job as they were supposed to,
there is no way something like this could have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Chihiro Kamisawa, an anti-nuclear activist, told the Associated
Press, ``So much has been made of Japan's sophisticated technology
that supposedly makes nuclear energy safe. The accident proves
that's absolutely not true.''  &QL;

REMOVING THE BULLETS AND TRYING TO JUDGE A SHOW

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The exhibition of handmade shotguns as sculpture that
resulted in the arrest on Wednesday night of gallery owner Mary
Boone was hardly new for artist Tom Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs, an exemplar of '90s-style artistic machismo, has
displayed his weapons before, and this show, his third in New York,
is actually lighter in the armaments department than his previous
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the police arrested Ms. Boone at her Fifth Avenue
gallery.
</P>
<P>
   The show included a vase of real bullets _ for visitors to take
home as souvenirs _ which the police removed on Wednesday and which
led to a charge of unlawful distribution of ammunition against Ms.
Boone. The handmade guns brought a charge of possession of unlawful
weapons, which was later dropped. A charge of resisting arrest was
dropped. And finally she was charged with possession of stolen
property because parts of the guns and their display case were made
of Con Edison barriers that Sachs had collected from city streets.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs, who works with all sorts of found materials, has
exhibited handmade guns since 1996. They are usually crude and
sinister and sometimes work. Still, the notion of anyone actually
pulling their triggers seems as unlikely as the thought of someone
firing a blunderbuss in a history museum.
</P>
<P>
   The show at Boone is in some respects tamer than Sachs' previous
New York shows, which included not only guns in elaborate cases,
but, for example, a weapon-testing chamber built from found
materials. Left alone it might have dulled the bad-boy image that
Sachs seemed to be cultivating.
</P>
<P>
   His first public profile was acquired in 1995 when, after
protests from religious groups, Barney's removed from its window
displays a Sachs' sculpture of a Nativity scene enacted by his
handmade versions of ``Hello Kitty,'' a wildly popular children's
character.
</P>
<P>
   After that, his work alternated between the overly cute and the
potentially violent or misogynist, the connecting link being his
amazing technical skill. The artist, who trained as an architect
and once worked for Frank O. Gehry, seems able to build anything,
and has shown a frequent interest in making things that work.
</P>
<P>
   He has made toilet plungers from orange Hermes boxes; large rats
out of the chic yellow packaging from Balthazar restaurant; chairs
and couches from New York telephone books, and modernist paintings
reminiscent of works by Mondrian and Robert Ryman from gaffer's
tape. Tiffany boxes are also a favorite material.
</P>
<P>
   His 1998 show at the Thomas Healy Gallery in Chelsea, which has
since closed, included a large cabinet containing handmade guns and
blackjacks as well as an encyclopedic array of consumer objects
incorporating the ``Hello Kitty'' image. The centerpiece was a
full-scale model of Fat Boy, the bomb that was dropped on Nagasaki,
Japan, in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusually overt display of misogyny, the interior of this
sculpture was outfitted with a bed and stereo set and on Saturdays
was inhabited by a young Asian woman.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the vase of bullets and the case of guns, weaponry has
taken the back seat at the Boone Gallery. The show seems a little
all over the place and suggests an artist who is either in
transition or has lost direction.
</P>
<P>
   The least interesting and most plentiful pieces on view consist
of boomboxes and stereo sets that are customized with the addition
of toys, leather and little carts that make them portable.
Excessively busy, most of these works are simply a familiar form of
assemblage art.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the Boone show is a large sculpture of a
working airplane bathroom, which the artist built by hand, mostly
from foam core. It resembles a space capsule, but its main source
of interest is that it is something few people ever see from the
outside, despite their familiarity with its interior. And splayed
across this exterior are its inner workings _ the various tubes,
pipes and tanks that enable it to function _ all made from found
materials.
</P>
<P>
   This large piece may turn out to be a step in the right
direction. It has some of the imposing presence and intricacy of
Sachs' earlier work, but it lacks either the threatening quality of
his guns or the saccharin cuteness of his other pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Macho, however, it still is, and this suggests another irony. In
the 1980s Ms. Boone's gallery, then in SoHo, was considered one of
the white-hot centers of the art boom and seen as slanting heavily
toward an overtly macho form of Neo-Expressionist painting.
</P>
<P>
   One of the decade's most famous photographs shows several of her
male artists posing bare-chested in her gallery. But now she has
run afoul of the law over a different, more real form of machismo.
</P>
<P>
   Given that Roman Catholic leaders and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani are
attacking Chis Ofili for a painting of the Virgin Mary spotted with
elephant dung at an exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, is it
possible that in the confused juncture of art and politics in the
city the National Rifle Association will mount a defense of Sachs?

YANKS BEAT ORIOLES IN NIGHTCAP TO CLINCH DIVISION TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ For just a few hours Thursday night, the New York
Yankees were relieved of the unwavering pressure they created for
themselves. They finished off the Baltimore Orioles Thursday night,
12-5, to clinch the American League East title.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Watson struck out Ryan Minor at 11:01 p.m. for the final
out, and then the Yankees shook hands and hugged on the field.
Derek Jeter shook a fist in celebration toward Yankee fans as he
ran off the field, and manager Joe Torre waved.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who lost the first game of the day-night
doubleheader, 5-0, didn't clinch with a strong finish. They have
played erratically against second-division teams much of this year,
losing three straight games to Tampa Bay as recently as last
weekend. But at 96-63, the Yankees remain in the running for the
best record in the league. They have three games remaining, at
Tampa Bay against the Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland is 97-62 and Texas 95-64 in the race for home-field
advantage and playoff placement. Torre indicated before Thursday's
doubleheader that regardless of whether his team wrapped up the
division against Baltimore, he intended to continue playing the
bulk of his regulars in an effort to win as many games as possible.
As it stands now, the Yankees would open the best-of-5 division
series in Yankee Stadium next Tuesday, against the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees faced upheaval even before they opened the season.
On the first day of spring training, David Wells, the broadly
curved left-hander who endeared himself to fans with his penchant
for pitching in big games and his taste for beer, was swapped with
two other players for star pitcher Roger Clemens. Torre received a
diagnosis of prostate cancer a couple of weeks later and was
replaced until mid-May by his close friend Don Zimmer, who
unhappily assumed what he considered a burden while struggling to
move on two painful knees.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Strawberry, a powerful part of the Yankees' lineup last
season, tried and failed to cope with the effects of chemotherapy
for colon cancer while attempting to win a spot with the team, and
in April was arrested for drug possession and solicitation. A
handful of players, from Paul O'Neill to Scott Brosius, were torn
by illnesses in their family.
</P>
<P>
   And all season the Yankees have played in the shadow of what
they accomplished in 1998, when they set a record by winning 125
games and finished with a four-game sweep of San Diego in the World
Series. Players sometimes griped early in the year that fans and
the news media unfairly compared the 1999 Yankees to that standard,
but by midsummer it became apparent that the Yankees themselves
were trying to live up to their own impossible expectations. Nearly
all the Yankees have been guilty of pressing and pushing themselves
into ruts of anxiety at one time or another, and their performance
suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their problems, however, they remain the most potent
club in the league and perhaps in all of baseball. Jeter moved to
the next level of stardom, his average above .350 most of this
season, and Mariano Rivera has not blown a save since July. Their
starting pitching of Clemens, David Cone, Orlando Hernandez, Andy
Pettitte and Hideki Irabu buoyed the team all year.
</P>
<P>
   Most of baseball's other divisions were long since wrapped up,
and there were a few days earlier this month when it appeared the
Red Sox might challenge the Yankees for the AL East title. But the
Yankees won 9 of 10 games, faltered in three straight losses
against Tampa Bay, but recovered enough here to wrap up the
division.
</P>
<P>
   When Hernandez tagged out Baltimore's Calvin Pickering on a
ground ball up the first-base line in the sixth inning, Pickering
threw an elbow in Hernandez's direction; the Yankees' pitcher
glared at him, and Martinez and pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre and
catcher Jorge Posada went to the mound to calm Hernandez. They all
shared a laugh, Martinez closing the meeting by drawing his hands
together and shouting a word, as if to break up a football huddle.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the clubhouse, arrangements had been made for a
celebration: There was champagne, and the lockers were covered. ``I
hope we do celebrate,'' Scott Brosius said earlier in the day.
``Because winning a division, that's an accomplishment that should
be recognized.''
</P>
<P>
   For a few hours, anyway. They will be back to business on
Friday, trying for home-field advantage, before the playoffs and
the pursuit of the organization's 25th championship open next week.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
and JONATHAN FEIGEN 
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
One day after being described as ``not willing to go the distance''
by teammate Scottie Pippen, the Rockets' Charles Barkley decided to
turn the other cheek.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pippen lashed out at Barkley during an interview Wednesday for
ESPN's SportsCentury series, calling him ``a very selfish guy'' and
saying he ``doesn't show the desire to want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barkley, speaking by phone Thursday from Phoenix, did not
answer Pippen's shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Pippen (stuff) is an annoying distraction to me,''
Barkley said, ``but I'll take the high road and not respond.
Believe me, it takes some (self-)control, but I have to do it. Why
get into a war of words?''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley did say that what might appear to be a petulant outburst
by Pippen sounded calculated to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's creating all this controversy just to get traded,''
Barkley said. ``He wants to get traded so bad that he'll just say
anything to make it happen. He should have just called me and said
that he didn't want to play here anymore. That's all it would have
taken. He didn't have to fabricate this friction like he did. I'm
very disappointed in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, who played for the minimum salary last season so the
Rockets could accommodate Pippen's five-year, $67 million deal, in
August said he resented Pippen's behind-the-scenes lobbying to get
himself traded to Los Angeles, where he could be reunited with
former Bulls coach Phil Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, Scottie owes the Rockets' fans an apology,'' Barkley
said at the time. ``They've been terrific to him. Second, he owes
the Rockets an apology. And third, he owes me an apology. Scottie
needs to stand up and be a man. If he does, we can move on.
Everything will be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen apparently resented the remarks and ripped into Barkley
during Wednesday's interview with ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't give Charles Barkley an apology at gunpoint,''
Pippen said. ``He can never expect an apology from me. If anything,
he owes me an apology for coming to play with his fat butt.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen went on to say he was the one who should be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very selfish guy,'' Pippen said of Barkley. ``He
doesn't show the desire to want to win. That's my reason for
wanting to get away from playing with him anymore, because he just
doesn't show the dedication. I probably should've listened to
Michael (Jordan) a year ago when he said that Charles will never
win a championship because he doesn't show any dedication.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very shocked to see what type of player he was by
spending half a season with him. I'm a guy that's dedicated to
winning, and I put out a lot of effort on the court. I expect that
from my teammates, especially from a guy of his caliber. You know
he's not willing to go the distance. There's no reason for me to
put my last three or four years at risk of never winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley said he had a hard time understanding the personal
nature of Pippen's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody was more supportive of Scottie than I was,'' Barkley
said. ``I don't think I offended him in any way. I'm disappointed
more than anything. But what good would it do me to get into a
public war of words with him? How can you win in that situation? It
wouldn't accomplish anything.''
</P>
<P>
   There is another factor to consider, Barkley added. Even though
Pippen has been rumored to be headed to Portland in a deal that
would have the Trail Blazers shipping six players in return, there
is still the possibility Pippen will be a Rocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell, we may have to play together,'' Barkley said. ``I'm
trying to take the high road and not make this a problem right now.
But if they don't trade him (Pippen), we may have some problems.''
</P>
<P>
   If Pippen launched his attack on Barkley intending to hasten his
departure from the Rockets, he might have earned his one-way
ticket. But the aftershocks of Pippen's invective Wednesday might
serve that cause not by inspiring the Rockets to deal him but by
giving them more options.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets were well on their way to a deal to ship Pippen to
the Blazers even before he ripped Barkley. But now that teams have
decided Pippen could be drastically marked down in a limited-time
offer, the offers have begun to roll in.
</P>
<P>
   After so many conversations on so many trade possibilities all
summer netted few real offers for Pippen, sources said Thursday
that many teams called to weigh in with their collections of
high-salaried players they would happily ship for him.
</P>
<P>
   But no offer has been deemed more attractive than the six-player
deal in the works with Portland. The trade would send Pippen to the
Trail Blazers for Walt Williams, Stacey Augmon, Kelvin Cato, Ed
Gray, Brian Shaw and Carlos Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, an outstanding shooter who could step into Pippen's
small-forward position, and Cato, a third-year center with
outstanding potential as a defender, are considered the keys to the
deal for the Rockets. Barring other transactions, the Rockets would
have to cut at least four players by the start of the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal was not complete Thursday, and the inclusion of
draft picks could be affected, several sources said, by Pippen's
comments. The trade will not be completed until Saturday at the
earliest, according to a source close to the discussions. Training
camp will begin Tuesday in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Rockets officials, citing team policy, declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   But if Pippen has made his desire to leave the Rockets clear, at
least two of the players involved have expressed their desire or
willingness to be moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walt's feelings are basically that he likes it in Portland,
but Walt loves to play,'' said Williams' agent, Mark Bartelstein.
``He likes to play a lot of minutes. We've talked to the Blazers
about their overabundance of threes and fours and that maybe it
would be best for everybody if Walt was moved. We did not demand a
trade, but this could be a terrific situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been talking to (Blazers vice present) Bob Whitsitt all
summer. Walt is a guy that has a lot of pride and loves to play.
It's been difficult for him to get a lot of minutes. They like
Walt, and he's a terrific person. They've been willing to work with
us to make a trade. But they weren't willing to just give him away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston is a good franchise. They've certainly got some pieces
there right now, and they play inside-out a lot, and Walt can make
the 3-pointers. They would need a (small forward), and Walt can
handle the ball as well as any (small forward) in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw is a free agent, but his agent, Jerome Stanley, said the
Trail Blazers have discussed the trade with him and that Shaw would
agree to a sign-and-trade deal to the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is anything here that would be a
problem,'' Stanley said. ``It's a part of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston is an excellent city. Brian would love to play
there.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
FOR now, the war of words appears over, or at least in a state of
truce while the U.N. Security Council debates sending in troops.
For now, Charles Barkley has put himself above the fray.
</P>
<P>
   Having considered the source, the Chuckster is taking the high
road. His only response to Scottie Pippen's sandbox-caliber chatter
is to express further disappointment in a fellow with whom he was
already disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Barkley is busy. That big ol' bottom of his at which
Snotty Scottie took direct aim? Well, rumor has it Charles stopped
off recently at the fat farm, trying to run off some of his rump
roast prior to the start of training camp next week.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley will return to Houston on Sunday night. Hopefully,
Pippen won't.
</P>
<P>
   The only body part Scottie is known to be exercising is his
mouth. Of course, cardio work for him would be futile, considering
how little evidence he gave us to suggest he has any heart left.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen's public bayou bridge-burning should come as a welcome
relief to Rockets fans. By giving the team almost no choice other
than to trade him, a win-win transaction on all counts, they'll try
that much harder to close a deal. They won't be lulled into
complacency, into making the fatal assumption he would return for a
second Rockets season intending to earn his absurd salary.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Tomjanovich might start sleeping better with Pip the Drip
out of his graying hair. He won't have to change his offense any
further to keep the big creep happy. Rudy T can resume coaching
full-time and give up his part-time baby-sitting responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, you ever try to find diapers for a kid Pippen's size?
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets will be a better team without the Pippen we know in
Houston, no matter what they get in return for him. I would trade
him to Portland for J.R. Rider's bail bondsman. Getting warm bodies
from the Trail Blazers is cream gravy. Cross your fingers the
Blazers don't come to their senses and deep-six the
six-for-one-half exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Williams by his lonesome for Pippen is enough to make you
shout ``Yippee!'' Williams is a good guy, a low-maintenance,
positive force in the locker room. Also, young Kelvin Cato seems
enough of a defensive presence at center to take a bit of the load
off Hakeem Olajuwon. Alone, they add up to far more of an asset
than a selfish, whiny Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   In case you're wondering why the Rockets aren't trying to
revisit the Glen Rice-Robert Horry trade, it's because the Lakers
have taken it off the table. Jerry West sacrificed Eddie Jones to
acquire Rice, and he's not ready to ship him out, certainly not for
a player of Pippen's more-dubious-by-the-day character. Even Phil
Jackson has to be shaking his head about Pippen's juvenile
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Barkley started this fight by roundly criticizing
Pippen's desire to be traded, but the points he made were sound,
and never once did he personally attack Scottie. Fact is, Pippen
has had no greater apologist than the Chuckster.
</P>
<P>
   Let no good deed go unpunished, Charles.
</P>
<P>
   But, remember, the one good thing about the Rockets having
acquired Scottie, as in spotty, is that he cost them only money
(and, OK, Roy Rogers). It was a $14 million experiment that blew up
in their faces, but the residual damage _ except to Pippen's
reputation _ was negligible. They didn't mortgage their future to
obtain his services.
</P>
<P>
   If he were to remain a Rocket, Scottie would become the bane of
their existence in the years to come. The last two seasons of his
five-year contract would cost the Rockets $37 million, crippling
their ability to remake the roster around him. And imagine how
worthless he's likely to be by then.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about a mandate to cut one's losses. To date, they have
wasted only a season waiting for him to get his head on straight,
and fortunately it was a short year, one that didn't place undue
strain on the aging legs of Charles and Hakeem. The gamble,
assuming they can dump the chump, hardly paid off, but it was worth
the risk. Who could have guessed he'd prove such a dud? He figured
to be, at the very least, a good complementary player to Olajuwon
and Barkley. Instead, he became a most uncomplimentary one.
</P>
<P>
   What if the Rockets can't move him? Mon dieu. They will make the
'74 Oakland A's look like the '79 Pirates. They'll need to have two
dressing rooms plus a padded cell for Tomjanovich. Jerry Springer
might have to be brought in as an assistant.
</P>
<P>
   So light a candle for this trade coming down. May Scottie's
unhappy trail lead him to the Blazers by the weekend. He needs to
be gone quickly, if only for his safety, before Barkley sees him.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's media day might end up looking like a World Wrestling
Federation production. And if push came to shove, it surely would
be the Chuckster vs. the duckster. Pippen hasn't a clue how to meet
a challenge head-on.

EDITORIAL: A PLACE TO RUN FROM
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Oct. 1:
</P>
<P>
   Even in this restless time, America's politicians need the
appearance of a healthy root system. Successful presidential
candidates in particular seem to require an elaborate connection to
some modest place, a down-home setting for the campaign's
background myth. Thus, Vice President Al Gore, mostly of
Washington, D.C., has returned to Tennessee and not merely to dust
off his old family homestead. Gore needs to establish a
headquarters that will operate more efficiently than the one that
turned him from front-runner into self-described underdog. But the
real goal is to minimize his deep connection to Washington, to
identify him with that supposedly more authentic America out there,
to be, as he said, closer to Kmart than K Street.
</P>
<P>
   The use of an identifying place as a definitional tool is not
new in presidential politics, and the blend of fact and invention
can vary widely. Ronald Reagan, a Midwesterner and a celluloid
wrangler, somehow managed to take on the romantic mantle of the
real West. George Bush the elder seemed most at home at
Kennebunkport, but he used a Houston address to define a ruddier
political persona. Jimmy Carter really was the Man from Plains,
Ga., and always planned to go back after the White House, which is
not what can be expected from the Man from Hope.
</P>
<P>
   For 2000, Gov. George W. Bush has enough Texas time on his
bioclock to offset his preppy lineage. Steve Forbes has established
his story line as a rich kid and proud of it. Elizabeth Dole,
despite years as a force in Washington, has a North Carolina
girlhood, complete with an army of college sorority sisters to help
out. Bill Bradley, who played basketball for New York and served as
senator for New Jersey, invoked a Mayberry childhood in Crystal
City, Mo., to launch his presidential campaign. Yet in an earlier
period, as Time magazine noted, Bradley checked out the
possibilities in Missouri before deciding in 1978 that he had a
better chance running for senator from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Gore is discovering that there are no risk-free zones
in presidential campaigns. He faces embarrassment at his new
address if Bush continues to lead him in the Tennessee polls.
Pundits are already seeing the southerly trek as a sign of
desperation. He also faces the possibility that Bradley will stick
to the calm style that has served him so well and refuse to join
the debates that Gore now needs more badly than Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley seems receptive, showing that both candidates understand
the public mood. The sudden upheaval in the Democratic contest has
riveted attention and represents an opportunity for a revitalized
national discussion, not just on health care, but on the whole
range of social-policy issues. Even the purported candidacies of
Donald Trump and Warren Beatty are signs of a heightened interest,
even passion, that has gripped this political season.
</P>
<P>
   Now, given the extreme front-loading of the primaries, both
Democratic and Republican voters need to see their candidates in
multiple joint appearances, starting even before the proposed
Democratic town meeting in New Hampshire in four weeks. Gore's
sudden interest in debates may be self-serving or even desperate,
but he has nonetheless offered a worthy idea. Maybe Bradley would
even agree to hold one debate at Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, a
fitting place for the celebration of roots, both real and slightly
imagined.  &QL;

EDITORIAL: HEALTH CARE REFORMS IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Oct. 1:
</P>
<P>
   The enactment of new health care reforms in California shows
that state leaders are well ahead of Congress in addressing the
need for managed care regulation. While many states have moved
forward with consumer protection laws aimed at health maintenance
organizations, the sweep of the California legislation contained in
21 bills, along with similarly broad legislation in Texas, sets an
important standard by which to judge national reform.
</P>
<P>
   The most controversial piece of the California package would
allow patients to sue managed care plans for compensatory and
punitive damages if the patient was substantially harmed by a
health plan's action to deny, delay or modify necessary medical
care. The barrier to suing would be high _ lawsuits would be
allowed only when a patient could show that he had suffered
significant harm or significant financial loss. But the law does
not limit the amount of recovery for those losses.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of legal liability has been bitterly fought in
Congress by the insurance lobby, and will be the focus again as the
House begins debate on patients' rights legislation next week. But
in California, Gov. Gray Davis and legislative leaders were able to
craft language that should deter frivolous suits while holding
health plans legally accountable for improper decisions. The
insurance lobby's warning that allowing lawsuits would send health
costs soaring simply has not materialized. An independent study of
one million public employees in California who already have the
right to sue HMOs found that the number of suits filed was very low
and the impact on medical costs minimal.
</P>
<P>
   The California reforms also guarantee patients the right to an
independent review of benefit denials and create a new state agency
called the Department of Managed Care to regulate the industry and
assist consumers with complaints. The package would further tighten
medical privacy laws, as well as require plans to provide coverage
for severe mental illness, prescription contraceptives and cancer
screening. Other states may follow California's lead if they see
that such reforms can improve health care without significantly
increasing costs.
</P>
<P>
   But state initiatives do not replace the need for federal
legislation. For one thing, none of these protections apply to
people in ``self-insured'' plans created by large employers, which
are exclusively federally regulated. More important, current
federal law has long been interpreted to bar patients covered by
private employer-sponsored health plans from suing for damages
caused by improper benefit denials, although the Supreme Court this
week decided to hear a case that will review this issue. The
California legislation tries to get around the legal hurdle by
framing the new state-granted right to sue as based on the right to
obtain quality of care rather the right to particular benefits.
That approach will clearly be challenged in court and may well be
struck down unless Congress closes the loophole in Federal law that
now shields health plans from meaningful liability.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 million Californians will benefit from new managed
care regulations. Americans elsewhere need Congress to enact basic
protections to insure that patients get the care they need.

FINLEY ROLLS, WAITS FOR WORD ON FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ After the 1979 season, then-Angels general
manager Buzzie Bavasi let Nolan Ryan get away. Soon Bavasi's son,
Bill, could be faced with a similar situation regarding Chuck
Finley.
</P>
<P>
   Finley, a free agent after this season, has surpassed most of
Ryan's pitching records with the Angels and it's him _ not Ryan _
who is considered as ``Mr. Angel'' to his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   The current Anaheim Angels GM hopes he doesn't follow in his
father's footsteps, especially since he wouldn't trade Finley to
the Indians for highly regarded prospects before this season's July
31 trade deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Finley made his final start of 1999 on Thursday night as the
Angels beat the Oakland A's 5-4 before 19,567 at Edison Field. The
question is, was it his last?
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Huson drove in Troy Glaus with a two-out single in the
eighth inning to snap a 4-4 tie, making a winner out of Angels
reliever Mark Petkovsek (10-4). Lou Pote pitched the ninth and
earned his second career save one night after getting his first.
</P>
<P>
   The game ended with right fielder Tim Salmon playing Rich
Becker's drive off the right-field wall perfectly, then throwing
Becker out at second.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Angel Randy Velarde had four hits for Oakland, and the
Angels' Garret Anderson hit his career-best 21st home run.
</P>
<P>
   But the story of the night was Finley. He gave up four runs and
10 hits in seven innings, striking out nine and walking four. The
nine strikeouts gave him 200 for the season (second best in the AL
behind Pedro Martinez's 312), marking the third time in his career
he's struck out 200 or more. He finished the season 12-11 with an
ERA of 4.43 ERA in 33 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Ripken (since 1981 with Baltimore) and Tony Gwynn (since
1982 with San Diego) are the only active players who have more
service time with one club than Finley, who joined the Angels in
1986.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's possible his Angels career is done, Finley never
allowed himself to get sentimental, saying there was no reason for
it. Sure, he might be gone, but so might anybody else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a waste of my time (to worry about it),'' he said.
``I don't even know where the organization's going, so.... There's
probably a lot of us who think we'll be here and might be gone.
There's no use to ponder.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley pitched horribly during the season's middle months. In 11
starts from June 7 through July 31, he was 1-5 with a 7.01 ERA. But
once the trading deadline passed, Finley turned it around.
Including Thursday's game, he is 7-1 with a 2.16 ERA in 11 starts
in August and September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew better days were ahead of me,'' he said. ``I've still
got a lot of life left in my arm ... for whoever.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley and Bavasi agreed to put off talks until after the
season. But before July 31 the two talked, and Finley reportedly
told teammates he was working on a deal worth $14 million over two
years.
</P>
<P>
   At the time it might have seemed a hefty price to pay for a
soon-to-be 37-year-old pitcher who lost 10 of his first 15
decisions this year. But Finley will finish the season as the team
leader in victories. Including this season, Finley has held or tied
the club lead in wins for seven consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Angels interim manager Joe Maddon has been with the organization
even longer than Finley. Maddon, who played in the Angels'
minor-league system in the 1970s and began coaching in 1981, said
the value of Finley's clubhouse presence is impossible to measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``You like Fin around because of everything he brings to the
table,'' Maddon said. ``Fin is the guy you identify as being an
Angel.... His record speaks for itself, it's not difficult to
ascertain. He's been a very important part of what we've done the
last 14 years. He's a wonderful person and a great pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley ranks first on the Angels' all-time list in games pitched
(436), victories (165), starts (379) and innings pitched (2,675).

<TEXT>
<P>
   Bernadette O'Farrell, an actress best known for her role as Maid
Marian in the 1950s television series ``The Adventures of Robin
Hood,'' died this week at 75, The Daily Telegraph of London
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. O'Farrell was often seen in cinematic roles written by her
husband, Frank Launder, the British screenwriter and director whose
boisterous ``St. Trinian's'' movies, created with Sidney Gilliat
and set in a girls' school, amused filmgoers during the 1950s and
60s. But it was her role as Maid Marian in the long-running Robin
Hood series that catapulted her to stardom.
</P>
<P>
   The series became one of the first British television programs
to succeed in the United States, and at the height of its
popularity more than 30 million viewers in Britain and North
America watched its weekly episodes. Essentially a traditional
version of the legend, the series, which ran from 1955 until 1958
and starred Richard Greene in the title role, proved popular with
younger viewers, partly because of its catchy theme song sung by
Dick James. It also had a high standard of script writing, some of
it by Ring Lardner Jr., who had been blacklisted in Hollywood for
his suspected Communist sympathies.
</P>
<P>
   But after two years and 78 episodes, Ms. O'Farrell feared that
she was becoming typecast, and in 1957 she left the series despite
receiving thousands of letters begging her to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Birr, County Offaly, Ireland, to a bank manager and a
gifted amateur actress, Ms. O'Farrell nevertheless showed no
interest in the stage. After being educated at a local convent, she
was working as a lawyer's secretary when she was invited to an
audition by the film director Sir Carol Reed, who knew her father.
</P>
<P>
   There she met Launder, who gave her a small part in his 1947
film ``Captain Boycott,'' with Stewart Granger. In 1949 she
appeared as a glamorous gym teacher in Launder and Gilliat's
``Happiest Days of Your Life,'' with Alastair Sim and Margaret
Rutherford. She married Launder the next year; he died in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1950s, Ms. O'Farrell combined stage work with small
parts in her husband's films, including ``The Story of Gilbert and
Sullivan''; ``The Genie,'' with Douglas Fairbanks Jr., and ``The
Square Ring,'' a boxing tale in which she divorced her husband
because she could not bear to see him battered. She last appeared
in 1959 in Launder and Gilliat's ``Bridal Path'' before retiring to
spend more time with her young family on their farm in
Buckinghamshire, England.
</P>
<P>
   Later, she and Launder moved to Monaco, where they were active
in local stage productions and charities.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by two daughters.

VIDEO SUPPLANTING BINOCULARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ Anyone want some slightly used binoculars?
</P>
<P>
   They zoom, they're lightweight, they're built to take a pounding
after a tough beat. And as of the opening of the Oak Tree racing
season at Santa Anita, they're obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   I brought my binoculars to the track on Wednesday and never
unpacked them. Like most of the crowd, I got my close-up views of
the horses courtesy of the giant video screen that now rises from
the infield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do that too, even though the race is right under my nose,''
said Santa Anita president and CEO Lonny Powell. ``You don't see a
lot of binoculars anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Binoculars, as much a part of the traditional racegoer's outfit
as a plaid coat, are in danger of becoming relics as more and more
fans follow the action on television in off-track betting
facilities and tracks themselves install more and more TV screens.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, Helen Storey, who works the turf-club check room,
might have rented 20 sets of binoculars a day and held 300
overnight for their owners. Now she rents none on the typical day
and locks up maybe 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of those are (used by) horse owners who want to focus on
their horses,'' Storey said.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Anita boasts of more than 2,000 TV sets throughout the
structure, including 9-inch screens in the boxes and on the lunch
tables.
</P>
<P>
   But the new, 40-by-53-foot screen facing the grandstand takes
videocracy to a new level, allowing even general-admission patrons
to watch on TV from their seats. It dwarfs Hollywood Park's
30-by-20-foot screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody said it's like going to a drive-in theater to watch
racing,'' said Oak Tree Racing Association executive vice president
Sherwood Chillingworth.
</P>
<P>
   The picture is amazingly bright and clear, even on sunny days
like Thursday, thanks to something called LED technology. The
structure was made of Japanese and Taiwanese components by the
Display Ad company, which is responsible for many of the Las Vegas
marquees and will supply the video screen for the Detroit Tigers'
new park.
</P>
<P>
   Watching races on TV has one practical advantage for
handicappers. It keeps the hands free to write notes in the program
on troubled trips and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some professional racewatchers will always prefer to use
binoculars and consult the TV only for replays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't come to the racetrack to watch TV,'' said Daily
Racing Form reporter Steve Andersen.
</P>
<P>
   One problem with Santa Anita's towering board is that it
obscures your view of about 40 yards of the backstretch. Even the
main TV camera is blocked, so for a second or two you see a picture
of a picture of a picture of a picture....
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the TV show seems to be the big hit among $20
million worth of renovations unveiled this week by the new Santa
Anita management.
</P>
<P>
   From his box seat Thursday, horse owner John Toffan (Free House,
Bien Bien, Mane Minister) watched a tense turf race on the big
screen without touching his binoculars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have 'em,'' Toffan said, pointing down near his feet.
``I just can't be bothered picking 'em up. It (the screen) is so
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in front: Pat Valenzuela won for the first time since Aug.
20, 1997 at Del Mar, leading from gate to wire with odds-on
favorite Irrelevant for trainer Mike Mitchell in Thursday's sixth
race.
</P>
<P>
   Valenzuela, 36, who claims a devotion to Christ, pointed to the
sky as he passed the finish. Irrelevant was his eighth mount since
a nearly two-year suspension for a drug-related absence.
</P>
<P>
   Valenzuela obviously worked hard to get back in riding shape. He
weighed out at 118 pounds Wednesday and Thursday and said he plans
to get down to 115 or 116.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say I'm about 90 percent,'' he said, fingering a couple of
pounds of excess flesh around the waist. ``I still don't have my
timing back 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The weekend: With the Nov. 6 Breeders' Cup races at Gulfstream
Park just five weeks off, Oak Tree has squeezed the West Coast's
major prep races into the meet's first three weekends.
</P>
<P>
   They begin with Saturday's Yellow Ribbon Stakes for filly and
mare turf specialists, who will have their own Breeders' Cup race
for the first time this year.
</P>
<P>
   The field of seven for the 1\-mile race includes female turf
champion Fiji (Jerry Bailey riding) _ in her first start of 1999 _
and top female miler Tuzla (David Flores).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she can run further than some of the others,'' said
Bob Baffert, who took over Tuzla's training from Julio Canani two
starts back. ``If the real Fiji shows up, we're all in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Projection play: Early Pioneer carried Laffit Pincay _ or was it
the other way around? _ to victory in a strong allowance sprint
Thursday to put the Hall of Fame jockey within 42 wins of Bill
Shoemaker's career-record 8,833.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay rode three winners at Seattle-area Emerald Downs during
the Fairplex Park season.
</P>
<P>
   With 114 in 1999, Pincay already has topped his '98 total. If he
keeps up the pace, the 52-year-old Hall of Famer will catch
Shoemaker in the first week of the new year during the Santa Anita
meet.
</P>
<P>
   Fine print: Oak Tree is guaranteeing the pick-six pool Saturday
will reach $1 million _ the association will kick in the difference
if fans bet less than that _ and unlike most guaranteed pick-sixes
this one would carry over to Sunday if no ticket is perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Oak Tree executives are hoping for on-site crowds totaling
60,000 Saturday and Sunday. A seven-figure carryover would really
set the turnstiles spinning.
</P>
<P>
   But since there's no advantage in betting a guaranteed pick-six,
cool-headed gamblers will sit out Saturday and hope for the
carryover.
</P>
<P>
   After some small fields during the week, new racing secretary
Mike Harlow came up with 98 horses for Saturday's 10-race card, up
from 86 on the first Saturday of the 1998 Oak Tree meet.
</P>
<P>
   Something's missing: The major public complaint about the
new-look Santa Anita seemed to be the removal of the odds board
over the walking ring, preventing bettors from checking out the
horses and the prices at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Powell promised to look into it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A WEEK AT THE RACES &QL; 
Southern California leaders: Jockeys (1998-99 Santa Anita,
Hollywood Park, Del Mar composite): David Flores, 161 wins; Alex
Solis, 54; Garrett Gomez and Laffit Pincay, 112; Chris McCarron,
108; Corey Nakatani, 102; Kent Desormeaux, 86. Trainers: Bob
Baffert, 88; Ron McAnally, 53; Mike Mitchell, 49; Richard Mandella,
42; Bob Hess Jr., 39; Julio Canani, 36; Bobby Frankel, 35; Vladimir
Cerin and David Hofmans, 32. &QL; 
Handicapper helper: Even if you didn't have 14-1 Hula Queen in the
opening-day feature, it should be no surprise that a horse rallied
from 10th to win the 6{-furlong turf race. Nineteen of the 21 races
run on that hillside course at the 1998 Oak Tree meet were won by
horses who were fourth or worse in the early going, one of the more
pronounced anti-frontrunner biases. &QL; 
On the stakes schedule: At Santa Anita: today, $70,000 In Excess
Stakes, 3-year-olds, 1 mile on turf; Saturday, $500,000 Yellow
Ribbon Stakes, fillies and mares 3 and up, 1\ miles on turf, and
$100,000 California Sires Stakes, 2-year-olds by state-based sires,
7 furlongs; Sunday, $300,000 Oak Tree Turf Championship,
3-year-olds and up, 1\ miles on turf, and $100,000 California Sires
Stakes (Filly Division), 2-year-old fillies by state-based sires, 7
furlongs. At Bay Meadows: Saturday, $100,000 California Sprint
Championship, Cal-breds 3 and up, 6 furlongs. At Louisiana Downs:
Saturday, $500,000 Super Derby, 3-year-olds, 1\ miles. At Belmont
Park: Sunday, $500,000 Flower Bowl Invitational Handicap, fillies
and mares 3 and up, 1\ miles on turf. At Hoosier Park: Saturday,
$300,000 Indiana Derby, 3-year-olds, 1 1/16 miles. &QL; 
Mileposts: David Hale, the local photo-finish equipment operator
who died when his motorcycle was hit by a truck Sept. 20, was
mourned by about 250 people at services Tuesday in Glendora. Hale,
49, left a wife, !boldJulie Hale of the Shoemaker Foundation, and
two children.... Eddie Delahoussaye is scheduled to ride Saturday
at Santa Anita, two months after he fractured his left shoulder in
a Del Mar accident. ``My doctor wants me to ease into it because
I'm still healing,'' said Delahoussaye, who'll ride three horses on
his first day back, including Tranquility Lake in the Yellow
Ribbon.... Kent Desormeaux (broken wrist) is due back Oct. 8....
New York's Successful Appeal earned a 119 Beyer speed figure _
fastest by a 3-year-old in 1999 _ by winning the Kentucky Cup
Sprint at Turfway Park on Saturday in 1:09.42 for 6 furlongs....
Behrens remained No. 1 in the NTRA media poll.... Trainer Bruce
Headley said 10-year-old sprinter Lakota Brave has been retired
after a failed comeback at Del Mar.... Kentucky is trying to make
its workout clocking information more reliable by having staffers
monitor horses entering the track in the morning. A similar system
makes California workout reports here perhaps the most informative
in the country.

RECOVERING PAUS LOOKS LIKE OLD SELF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The accuracy and tight spiral returned this week,
as Bruins quarterback Cory Paus showed he hasn't missed a beat.
</P>
<P>
   Bruised ribs prevented Paus from playing against Stanford, but
he quickly regained his pre-injury form with one of his best weeks
of practice this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Wednesday), he was phenomenal: He threw one incomplete,''
UCLA coach Bob Toledo said. ``He's so accurate. If he's healthy,
he's a heck of a quarterback. He's going to have a great career.''
</P>
<P>
   Paus wore a sternum jacket Thursday to protect his chest, showed
no signs of discomfort and will use it Saturday at Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   If he's reinjured, the Bruins may use second-stringer Drew
Bennett in running situations and third-stringer Scott McEwan in
passing situations. (Bennett has a strained right elbow and can't
throw more than 10 yards.)
</P>
<P>
   ``McEwan had a very tough Tuesday, a very good Wednesday, and he
responded pretty well (Thursday),'' Toledo said. ``I told him I
wasn't pleased with the way he played Tuesday. But part of that is
he was the third quarterback, and he didn't get any reps.''
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: Right guard Mike Saffer will play after missing
two games with a sprained ankle. His return means UCLA will have
its starting offensive line available for the first time this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Outside linebacker Tony White (pneumonia) is questionable.
</P>
<P>
   Tailback DeShaun Foster (sprained ankle) is also questionable.
If he can cut at full speed, he'll play. If not, he won't.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State update: Quarterback Ryan Kealy (bruised ribs) and
star tailback J.R. Redmond (separated shoulder) are questionable.
Their availability will be determined before kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   Review of the Week: Defensive end Pete Holland, a history major
and six-time member of the director's honor roll, has agreed to
review a book each week for the Daily News. This week: ``D-Day,''
by Stephen E. Ambrose.
</P>
<P>
   ``In `D-Day,' Ambrose _ who provided factual direction for
Steven Spielberg during production of `Saving Private Ryan' _ tells
the story of the most fateful day of the 20th century. But Ambrose
does not restrict himself to the horror, mistakes and success of
the June 6, 1944 invasion. His book integrates the preparation and
planning, the struggles and the repercussions of the event in
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ambrose is a humble historian. He doesn't re-create the event
in his own words. Instead, he allows the participants to tell their
story through his copious research and countless interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the volume of interviews disturbs the continuity of
Ambrose's prose, the book's literary deftness and historical
significance instills a deep sense of pride in the men of June 6 _
and a feeling of admiration for the man who so expertly chronicles
their actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 3 sacks (out of four).
</P>
<P>
   Mixed review: In two respects, UCLA has a difficult conference
schedule: It's the only team that plays its first two games on the
road; and it's the only team that doesn't play lowly Washington
State.
</P>
<P>
   But timing is also critical, and the Bruins couldn't have asked
for better. Each opponent (except USC) has a tough game prior to
facing UCLA:
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins play Arizona State on Saturday _ a week after it lost
at Cal. They face Oregon the week after the Ducks play at archrival
Washington. They face Cal after the Bears play at Brigham Young.
They face Oregon State after the Beavers play at Stanford. And they
face Arizona after the Wildcats play Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Whether any of it matters remains to be seen. After all, playing
at Stanford didn't seem like such a tough task three weeks ago.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's always nice when you see a scientist in
playfully patterned scrubs; it suggests that English, rather than
Science, is the language of choice. But Dr. Tracey S. McNamara,
head of the pathology department at the Bronx Zoo (those are
geckos, by the way, on her scrubs) quickly disabuses you of that.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists nationwide are aflutter over the findings that the
encephalitis outbreak that has resulted in at least five deaths in
the New York metropolitan region was caused by a virus never before
seen in the Western Hemisphere, the somewhat exotically named West
Nile virus.
</P>
<P>
   Many are crediting the findings to Dr. McNamara's lab work.
</P>
<P>
   Tell us, if you would, Dr. McNamara, of the moment when you
realized you were onto something new.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ames'' _ sorry, we have to stop immediately to translate:
that's the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa,
where Dr. McNamara had been sending tissue samples from dead birds
_ ``was working on the virus,'' Dr. McNamara says, surrounded by
two cans and a bottle of Diet Pepsi, which, one suspects, have been
fueling both her 14-hour work days and her somewhat hyper
discourse.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said it was 40 nanometers in diameter. I was like,
`Eureka! It's a flavi virus, what they are now calling the West
Nile. It's part of the Group B arbo virus, arbo stands for
arthropod-borne virus. The group everyone thought it would be was
the alpha virus, those are 60 to 65 nanometers. We differentiate
virus by their size and characteristics. No previous representative
of that group of virus has been known to ever kill birds. I knew we
had something new.''
</P>
<P>
   Better we tell this story, so the accomplishments of the
compulsive, relentlessly logical research veterinarian her
colleagues occasionally call Dr. Death do not get lost:
</P>
<P>
   This past summer, crows were dying in huge numbers around the
Bronx. The week after Labor Day, a number of birds in the Bronx Zoo
collection were found dead, apparently of encephalitis; around the
same time some human deaths were attributed to the disease. Dr.
McNamara felt the coincidence was ``too striking to ignore.'' She
performed post-mortems on the zoo birds and sent tissue to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and to the National
Veterinary Lab, pursuing her suspicions that ``a novel disease''
might be involved.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Duane J. Gubler, head of the Center for Disease Control's
arbo virus field station in Fort Collins, Colo., has said his
institute could not have made the diagnosis of West Nile virus as
quickly ``without Dr. McNamara's persistent sleuthing.''
</P>
<P>
   Was Dr. McNamara persistently sleuthing or persistently
pestering, she is asked. A deft dodge:
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say the secretaries could recognize my voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Across Gotham, people hire publicity agents to get into the
paper. The charm of scientists and zoo keepers of the Wildlife
Conservation Society is that they would like the press to go away.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. McNamara, 45, is of this breed. She regards a reporter with
the same enthusiasm the reporter shows for the dead chameleon
floating in formaldehyde in her lab, which is to say, none.
</P>
<P>
   Is all this press attention exciting? No, she would prefer to
get back to work and ``trim in the cases''; she still does not have
the full histo-pathology on the zoo animals that have died. What
did her parents do? Dr. McNamara's arms cross protectively. She
says she doesn't see any reason to give personal information. It's
``embarrassing.'' There is one unexpectedly frank admission. Asked
if she has a significant other, Dr. McNamara blurts, ``Single _and
available,'' with an urgency that suggests she should take a break
and get out of the lab.
</P>
<P>
   She does say, eventually, that she grew up in Forest Hills,
Queens, one of two children. Her father owned a newsstand, her
mother was a math teacher. Her mother was also a ``brilliant''
investor, which allowed the family to travel frequently. Dr.
McNamara loved animals, travel and languages, and majored in French
at St. Lawrence University in upstate New York. In her junior year,
at the University of Rouen _ in the city ``where Joan of Arc was
burned'' _ she decided to be a veterinarian, and got a degree at
Cornell University.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. McNamara now lives in a zoo-owned apartment on City Island.
She owns two ``fabulous'' Siamese cats, Coco Puff and Pussy Willow,
despite being allergic to them. She enjoys the mystery books of
Patricia Cornwall, whose heroine is a pathologist. She is a
Buddhist. She does not, it turns out, carve a heck of a turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't eat it, it's too close to the work. I haven't been
able to pick up a chicken wing in years. Or barbecue. If it's
recognizable, I can't pick it up. I'm too aware of disease. I won't
let my friends eat sushi. I read the morbidity and mortality weekly
report. From the CDC.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, even though camera crews are lining up to interview her,
Dr. McNamara cannot get too worked up. Two times before, she has
discovered virus in unexpected places.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big thing, but it's not the first time I've
uncovered something like this, and I suspect it won't be the
last,'' Dr. McNamara says. Uncharacteristically, she flounders for
a moment seeking a reference.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's that quote from Shakespeare? `There are more things in
heaven and earth, Horatio''' . . .
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes, a language we both speak, we can do this one together:
</P>
<P>
   . . . ```than are dreamt of in your philosophy.'''

USC BRUISED, NOT BEATEN (YET)
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the span of about four hours last Saturday
night, USC lost its franchise player and a triple-overtime thriller
to Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Could things get any worse for the Trojans? Probably. The morbid
thought following the lost weekend in Eugene was whether the
Trojans' season is already over three games into the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   It's a vicious question, but there's little doubt USC is reeling
after star quarterback Carson Palmer broke his collarbone and the
Trojans dropped their Pacific-10 Conference opener.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Palmer is the single most devastating injury USC
could have suffered, and has produced some numb feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really tough, to tell you the truth,'' wide receiver
R. Jay Soward said. ``Nobody talked about Carson getting hurt.
Nobody talked about that happening before the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, expectations for the Trojans have diminished. No one
was thinking about anything but whether USC could challenge for the
Pac-10 title a couple of weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are questions about everything from quarterback to
tailback to the offensive line to the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're wounded, I know that,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said.
``This is the toughest loss we've had to come back from. And the
loss of Carson. We've been blasted.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, did we mention the schedule is about to hit its supposed
rough patch?
</P>
<P>
   ``The next three weeks are brutal,'' Hackett added.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the entire month of October is going to determine the
Trojans' fate. After Saturday's game with undefeated Oregon State
at the Coliseum, USC travels to Arizona and Notre Dame, returns
home to face conference leader Stanford and then finishes up at
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might be looking at 6-6,'' a player said in half-jest this
week.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans (2-1) aren't exactly giving up on the season, but
they realize they are a long way from the optimism that flowed
after their 62-7 season-opening victory over Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long season. We can't let this take too much of a
toll,'' cornerback Kris Richard said. ``We have to move on. We're
planning on bouncing back. We don't want to develop that losing
mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett believes a free fall can be prevented by remembering
last year's team, which followed every regular-season loss with a
victory. That includes coming back from demoralizing losses to Cal,
Oregon and UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans' energy in practice this week led Hackett to believe
this year's team will also be able to recover quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The signs are there. This team has great resilience,'' Hackett
said. ``We're a good football team. We know that.''
</P>
<P>
   They will have to be resilient, considering backup quarterback
Mike Van Raaphorst is likely to play the rest of the season,
barring a miraculous recovery from Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer's injury could effectively undermine the offense's
confidence, but tailback Chad Morton said that as Van Raaphorst
engineered the fourth-quarter comeback against Oregon, he noticed a
different feeling in the huddle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've got it solved,'' Morton said. ``I know a lot of
guys were scared with Carson going down. But toward the middle of
the fourth quarter, Mike came back and a lot of guys had faith in
him. He has a lot of confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also a theory that Van Raaphorst might play better this
season because he no longer has to worry about Palmer waiting in
the wings to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst said he doesn't feel any burden to prevent the
Trojans from regressing offensively, or worry he might become a
scapegoat if USC starts losing games.
</P>
<P>
   He even discounts the proposition that Palmer's presence
affected his performance last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any of that as extra weight. I don't feel extra
pressure,'' Van Raaphorst said. ``I've been up and down too much to
worry about that. A friend told me, `You're like a cat with nine
lives.' He told me, `You're pretty invincible.' ''
</P>
<P>
   His teammates hope so. Some worried privately about his chronic
nausea and vomiting that affected him before or during three games
last season, and wondered if game-day jitters were the culprit.
</P>
<P>
   But Van Raaphorst said he discovered last summer while visiting
his family doctor in San Diego that the anti-cramping pills passed
out before games were the culprit.
</P>
<P>
   As much as the quarterback position becomes the focal point for
USC's remaining nine games, Hackett places more significance on the
rest of the Trojans' reaction to Van Raaphorst.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the quarterback,'' he said. ``It's how the team
responds to change at quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the inconsistent offensive line will have to do
a better job, considering Van Raaphorst is less mobile than Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means the offensive line's got to keep Mike clean,'' Soward
said.
</P>
<P>
   For every doubter who figures USC will fold under all of this
adversity, there are those who remain unaffected by the recent
misfortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any doubts. My goal is the same, the Rose Bowl,''
linebacker Zeke Moreno said. ``If anything, all of this has made us
mad to kick some butt.''

KINGS READY FOR MURRAY'S NEW ERA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There's no truth to the rumor Andy Murray was
plugged into the NHL computer that spits out the team schedules.
</P>
<P>
   You can see where somebody might draw that conclusion, though.
It'd be just like the Los Angeles Kings' fastidious first-year head
coach to start the season against a Nashville team that was
peripherally responsible for the firing of Murray's predecessor,
Larry Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings lost three of four games against the expansion
Predators. Being outworked and outscored by a rag-tag team of
overachievers provided an apt metaphor for the franchise's sorry
1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
   What better way to usher in a new era than to open the season
with a resounding victory in Nashville on Saturday?
</P>
<P>
   It's tough to predict where the Kings will finish in the
wonderful Western Conference _ home to the past four Stanley Cup
champions _ but we can say with absolute certainty they'll own the
first-year Atlanta Thrashers in their two meetings this season.
</P>
<P>
   Murray will make sure of that.
</P>
<P>
   The pundits don't give the Kings _ a consensus favorite to bring
up the rear of the Pacific Division _ much of a prayer of making
the playoffs. To pick the Kings to finish out of the Conference's
top eight is to seriously underestimate Murray's powers of
perfection.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings will grace the postseason in 2000 because they are
more skilled than last year, they can't help but be more healthy
(they lost 335 man games to injuries or illnesses last season, 169
more than the year before) and they will be more efficient than
Molly Maids.
</P>
<P>
   Forget ``Serious Hockey,'' the slogan of this year's Kings might
as well be ``Excellence: It's all in the details.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray is so organized, every practice and every period allows
his players about as much wiggle room as the neutral-zone trap. He
is so meticulous, if David E. Kelly were to make a movie of the
Kings, Murray would be played by Tony Randall. Or David Hyde
Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   Such fastidiousness isn't just a compulsion, it's an imperative
for any team having to navigate around Dallas and Detroit and
Colorado, arguably the three best teams in all of professional
hockey.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings dropped 18 one-goal games last season. Twelve of those
losses were to conference foes. With so many games decided by one
shot or one shift, diligence matters. Coaches can't afford to leave
their skaters on the ice for even a second too long. Players can't
afford to lose their focus for even a heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   As such, Murray has assigned equipment manager Peter Millar to
time each shift of every game this year. Millar will be like a
track coach calling out splits in a race. When he gets to 40
seconds, it'll be time for one shift to pass the baton, as it were,
to another.
</P>
<P>
   Any player who can't concentrate for 40 seconds at a stretch
likely will find himself with all the time in the world to
daydream. On those AHL or IHL bus trips.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, those who perform laudably can expect to see extra
ice time, no matter if they're a star or journeyman. Murray, you
see, is an equal opportunity taskmaster.
</P>
<P>
   Barring injuries, the Kings will have the depth this year to
deliver pointed messages, something Robinson wished to do but
couldn't if the Kings were to remain at all competitive.
</P>
<P>
   The first shots of the new regime were fired during the Kings'
second exhibition game against Colorado. The Kings fell behind 2-1,
at which point Murray called a timeout and called his team out.
They proceeded to rally for an overtime victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings can't say they weren't warned. Murray met with every
player during the summer and outlined exactly what he expected from
each. He followed each meeting up with a letter, re-stating his
points.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that before the start of training camp the Kings had
had more one-on-one contact with their head coach than some NHL
players will experience in a season with their delegating,
detached, dictatorial bosses.
</P>
<P>
   Murray made quite an impression in the dressing room during the
Kings' penalty-marred exhibition game against Anaheim last week. If
his players' sticks hadn't been littered all over the ice the
players would have been tempted to bang them on the ice when Murray
harangued Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg for sending his players at
the Kings' skilled skaters after Aki Berg and the Ducks' Teemu
Selanne collided in the corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the players got out of it was he's willing to stick up
for us, at any cost,'' said defenseman Rob Blake. ``That's what
guys want.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Kings need is for Blake to stay healthy and for his
defensive partner Mattias Norstrom to get signed and for Jozef
Stumpel to perform more like Mark Grudzielanek than Chan Ho Park in
this, the final year of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   They need defenseman Jere Karalahti to get his visa and for
center Bryan Smolinski to smolder while he skates and for winger
Ziggy Palffy to be, well, himself.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, though, what the Kings need is for every player to
buy into Murray's methods. He holds the blueprint for success, so
long as his players follow it.

CSUN'S BRADLEY HOSPITALIZED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Maybe it isn't tonsillitis that is keeping Jaumal
Bradley off the football field. Bradley's medical condition has
become serious.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, Cal State Northridge's starting tailback, has been
admitted to St. Francis Hospital in Lynwood because his throat has
become so swollen he can't eat solid food. Bradley didn't play last
week in CSUN's 48-41 loss at Eastern Washington and isn't going to
play Saturday against Idaho State at North Campus Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bradley) took tests for strep throat, mono and a throat
culture last Thursday,'' said CSUN interim head coach Jeff Kearin.
``It's turned out to be a viral infection. (Our doctors) have been
mistreating him for six days. We've been pumping him full of
antibiotics for nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, whose playing weight is between 215 and 210 pounds, has
lost 18 pounds since his illness began. With 198 yards in the
Matadors' first two games, he was on pace for a 1,000-yard season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was here two days ago and looked 100 percent better,''
Kearin said. ``He's lost so much weight...he looks like a different
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kearin is not only concerned about Bradley's health. Bradley
could be contagious, and he went with the team on the trip to
Eastern Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The timetable for Bradley's return could be two weeks or a
month, depending on the seriousness of his infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``My big thing is how quickly he will regain the weight,''
Kearin said. ``I'll be very happy if he's back in two games.''
</P>
<P>
   Ending it: Two Matadors quit the team Tuesday _ junior defensive
lineman Eric Falconer and junior defensive back Jermaine Hunsaker.
Neither is a starter.
</P>
<P>
   Falconer has had knee problems for two years and he hardly
practiced this fall. Hunsaker, a transfer from Washington State,
played sparingly in three games, recording three tackles.
</P>
<P>
   Happy return: Back in action Thursday was offensive lineman
Ernie Fierro, who had been out two weeks with a back injury.
Fierro, a 300-pound junior transfer from Nevada, gives the Matadors
depth; CSUN took only eight healthy offensive linemen to Eastern
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Even better: It was reported Thursday that CSUN quarterback
Marcus Brady is leading the Big Sky in total offense. Brady is also
No. 1 in total offense in Division I-AA.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as good: Wide receiver Aaron Arnold, who broke the
Matadors' school record for career receiving yards last week, leads
the conference in receptions per game (8.7 average) and is second
in yards (296).
</P>
<P>
   Back for more: Idaho State quarterback Kevin McCarthy is making
an unlikely start against CSUN.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy, a junior, lost his job in fall camp to Shane Griggs, a
transfer from South Carolina. Griggs tore the ACL in his right knee
against Ft. Lewis on Sept. 11, however, and is out for the season.
McCarthy, who started the Bengals' last six games in '98 and threw
for 823 yards, won't be asked to do much against CSUN, however,
because junior tailback Nick Whitworth is second in the conference
in rushing yards (625).
</P>
<P>
   CSUN is last in Division I-AA in run defense.

`YOU`VE GOT (HATE) E MAIL'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If it wasn't bad enough that USC kicker David
Newbury missed three field goals against Oregon, he felt even worse
when he received a nasty e-mail from a fan this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a real shallow person to do that. I don't know why
anyone would take the time to make someone feel bad,'' Newbury
said. ``It said that I cost us the game and a Top 25 ranking.''
</P>
<P>
   Newbury said that punter Mike MacGillivray also received an
e-mail ``because he had a punt go out of bounds.''
</P>
<P>
   The junior college transfer said he received comfort from
quarterback Carson Palmer, who said he received angry e-mails last
season.
</P>
<P>
   There was some good news for Newbury. His brother, Keith, who
lives in Texas, noticed a flaw in Newbury's kicking technique while
watching a tape of the Oregon game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was taking a step toward (holder) John Fox and then came
around like on a golf swing,'' Newbury said. ``I've straightened it
out. I've never looked forward to a game like this Saturday. It
will be a real test of my confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Newbury, who spent extra time kicking at the Coliseum on
Thursday, made 11 of 13 field goals from 42 yards in practice this
week and said his kicks are traveling much better than in last
week's practice.
</P>
<P>
   Coaching connection: USC defensive line coach Ed Orgeron is
extremely close to Oregon State head coach Dennis Erickson, who
gave Orgeron his first job as an assistant at Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be out there to kick our butt,'' Orgeron said. ``There's
no doubt about that. He's extremely competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Orgeron coached the Miami lines that included Cortez Kennedy and
Russell Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson said this week that USC's defensive line is similar to
those Miami lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not there yet, but that's where we're aiming to get,''
Orgeron said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson in control: As reported last week, offensive coordinator
Hue Jackson called the plays last week against Oregon. He is
expected to call the plays again Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer update: Doctors examined quarterback Carson Palmer on
Wednesday night and found that his broken collarbone is healing on
schedule, meaning he will still be out six to eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting a lot less sore,'' Palmer said. ``And starting to
heal better. Hopefully, I'll be ready for the UCLA game.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Palmer is relegated to watching practice from
the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate it,'' he said. ``I hate being out here and not
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer is forced to sleep on a stack of pillows so that he can
be upright in his bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like sleeping in a chair,'' Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   No respect: Oregon State (3-0) earned one vote in the latest
Associated Press poll. The vote was provided by a reporter in
Akron, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Beavers received a vote was two seasons ago,
when a reporter from Arkansas mistakenly put the 2-2 Beavers at No.
25 in his poll, thinking they had a winning record.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: Tailback Malaefou MacKenzie, bothered by a sore
hamstring, will probably not be at full strength until midseason.
He is doubtful for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive linemen Eric Denmon (knee), Donta Kendrick (ankle) and
cornerback Eric Reese (ankle) are probable. Defensive lineman Aaron
Williams (sore Achilles') and safety DeShaun Hill (foot) are
possible.

THE CANDLE IS OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As the late-afternoon shadows crept across the
infield of Candlestick Park, a strong wind kicked up and suddenly
things seem a little more like home.
</P>
<P>
   For most of Thursday being here seemed like crashing a cocktail
party for 61,389. When the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco
Giants played the final game the sun was out and the crowd was
well-behaved. Even when Giants reliever Julian Tavarez drilled Mark
Grudzielanek in the back in the ninth inning, everyone kept their
seats.
</P>
<P>
   No fights, no hot dog wrappers caught in the batter's shoe.
</P>
<P>
   There were names and faces that didn't register when 50 or so
old Giants were introduced after the game. Some video clips of guys
in long sideburns and gaudy-looking uniforms that will never have a
place in Cooperstown. Sure the crowd cheered Barry Bonds. Somebody
has to.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of Willie Mays and Juan Marichal, it was like looking
through a yearbook that had nobody you knew.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly the guy in the next seat was crying. Couldn't be
because the Dodgers won 9-4 in some meaningless game in the final
week of the season. He was crying because he'll never sit in that
seat again. He was crying because to a Giants fan there is no such
thing as a meaningless Dodger game.
</P>
<P>
   That is the connection that made Thursday's going-away party so
special. If there weren't Giants there wouldn't be Dodgers. They
weren't a bad team, except maybe for the early '80s. But even in
their championship seasons they were the underdog. They hated us,
but we never hated them.
</P>
<P>
   A July night in Dodger Stadium was glorious. A July night in
Candlestick was a trip to the South Pole. But you couldn't have had
one without the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a player's standpoint, this was the worst place you could
ever play,'' said former Giants second baseman Robby Thompson, who
once turned down a chance to sign with the Dodgers as a free agent.
``But I wouldn't have changed a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans in L.A. are pretty smug about their success. They don't
even bother with old-timers' stuff anymore. Here it is different. A
huge cheer went up for '70s reserve catcher Mike Sadek and Giants
fans made him a baseball god, if for just a few moments.
</P>
<P>
   It was a much bigger ovation than anything Brett Butler heard.
The scrappy Butler helped get the Giants to their last World Series
in 1987. More importantly to these fans, he left here to play for
the Dodgers four years later. They booed him Thursday like they did
the day he left.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally it was a day for romantics, even if many think
Candlestick had less charm than Riverfront Stadium. Imperfection
looked kind of sweet in the twilight.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, when the names were called it was clear that there was
life here after the Dodgers. But typically, the memories were more
funky than famous. Game 7 of the 1962 World Series when Willie
McCovey lined out to the Yankees' Bobby Richardson with everything
on the line.
</P>
<P>
   There was the earthquake that halted the 1989 series for more
than a week. The Giants got swept by Oakland in that one and
haven't been close to coming back.
</P>
<P>
   But at the end, the Giants trotted out their greatest jewel.
Mays walked through the open doors in center field wearing his old
baseball spikes and waving in the wind to the fans who never really
appreciated him when he played here. He was a New York guy. Willie
McCovey was theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the cheers you could just hear former Dodgers coach Joey
Amalfitano, a Giants bonus baby in the 1950s, offering to fight
anybody who didn't think Mays was the greatest player who ever
lived.
</P>
<P>
   Mays was the one player for whom the Dodgers never had an
answer.
</P>
<P>
   This time the fans got it right.
</P>
<P>
   When they cranked up Tony Bennett for one last rendition of ``I
Left My Heart in San Francisco,'' there was no better place to be.
They blew out the candles on Candlestick Thursday afternoon. Even
with the wind, it was some party.

MADDON A LONG SHOT FOR PERMANENT JOB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Anaheim Angels were 15-10 under interim
manager Joe Maddon going into Thursday'sgame, a winning percentage
of .600, but Maddon remains a long shot to shed the ``interim'' tag
and win the manager's job for next season.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Garner and Don Baylor are the leading candidates, but
Maddon's approach is to not concern himself with anything other
than the immediate task at hand -- which is getting ready for that
particular night's game.
</P>
<P>
   Maddon, though, cannot be completely overlooked. The Angels will
finish with a winning record under Maddon and going into Thursday's
game needed only one more victory to guarantee a winning record in
September for the first time since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the way the team has played, I like the attitude in the
clubhouse a whole lot, and I like the interaction among players,
things I see as being improved.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddon was asked if he thinks he's presented himself well to
management.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to think I have,'' he said. ``But it's up to somebody
else to make that decision. I've done everything I can for the past
three or four weeks. I would not have done anything differently. If
it doesn't work out and I don't get the opportunity full time, I
can walk away feeling satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddon said he has not yet talked with general manager Bill
Bavasi about scheduling an interview for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper won't forget season: Pitcher Brian Cooper's season is
finished, but he won't soon forget it. The former standout at
Glendora High, Citrus College and USC began the season in Double-A
and finished it in the majors, making five starts with the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   With the Angels he went 1-1 (three no-decisions) with a 4.88
ERA, gave up 23 hits in 27 2/3 innings and secured himself an
opportunity to make the starting rotation next spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunity's been awesome,'' Cooper said. ``I think I've
shown I can pitch at this level. I didn't embarrass myself.
Definitely my control needs to improve (18 walks, four hit batters)
... to come up and walk guys I'm sure did not make them happy. But
I consider myself a control pitcher. It's a matter of trusting
myself and going at guys. That's my main concern for now.''
</P>
<P>
   An opportunity: With closer Troy Percival (inflamed right
shoulder) likely shut down for the rest of the season, Lou Pote
will get an opportunity to finish games. He got his first chance
Wednesday night, retiring the A's in order in the ninth to earn his
first career save. The Angels would like to see Pote, a starter in
the minors, develop into a set-up role.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the kind of stuff he possesses, he gets both left-handed
and right-handed hitters out,'' Maddon said. ``A forkball doesn't
know the difference. And he's got plenty of fastball -- he gets up
to 92 mph. If he could accomplish this (closing), we'll look at him
in a set-up position (next season).''
</P>
<P>
   Big attraction: Ramon Ortiz has pitched all year, starting with
the Fall League, then winter ball, then spring training and a full
season in the minors and majors. He's become a big attraction in
the Winter League, but the Angels have suggested he take a break
this winter and rest his arm some.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz said he plans to spend a lot of time this off-season in
Southern California to learn English.
</P>
<P>
   Next: The Angels and Texas Rangers begin a three-game series
tonight at 7:05 at Edison Field. Ortiz (2-3, 6.17 ERA) will start
for Anaheim against Texas' Esteban Loaiza (9-5, 4.61).

 SIMPLE ERROR DOOMED MARS POLAR ORBITER  &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's the difference between pounds and miles on the one hand,
and grams and kilometers on the other?
</P>
<P>
   The answer could have saved the $125 million Mars Polar Orbiter
from destruction last week, if watchdog computers at NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena had only known about the
discrepancy.
</P>
<P>
   In an embarrassingly simple mistake, NASA officials said
Thursday, the spacecraft burned up on impact with the Martian
atmosphere because two navigation teams and their computers had
confused English and metric units.
</P>
<P>
   After flying more than 415 million miles over nine months, the
spacecraft was about to enter its first orbit around the Red Planet
September 23 when it accidentally flew too low toward Mars, mission
engineers said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday the engineers said they had found the cause: It
turned out that engineers at Lockheed Martin Astronautics in
Colorado, who built the spacecraft and are responsible for its
health, transmitted the orbiter's final course and velocity to
Pasadena using the English measurement of pounds per second of
force.
</P>
<P>
   But the spacecraft's navigation team at JPL Mission Control in
Pasadena _ like almost all space scientists and engineers _ always
use the metric system in their work. Their computers used the
metric term newtons, or grams per second of force, to send final
course and velocity commands to the Mars-bound spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   The ship flew just a hair too close and disintegrated in the
Martian atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about velocities in millimeters per second,''
said Tom Gavin, deputy director of the laboratory's space and Earth
sciences programs. ``We had multiple systems of checks and
balances, but they just didn't catch it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gavin said previous Mars missions always used metric
measurements.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed officials are reviewing contracts to see whether the
space agency specified the units of measurement, said Noel Hinners,
vice president of flight systems for Lockheed Martin Astronautics
in Denver. ``We should have had them in metric units,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bad numbers had been used since the spacecraft's launch last
December, but the effect was so small it went unnoticed. The
difference added up over the months as the spacecraft journeyed
toward Mars.
</P>
<P>
   The loss is not expected to affect NASA's relationship with
Lockheed, which has built several probes for the space agency,
including the Magellan probe to Venus and the Mars Global Surveyor
orbiter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country has not gone 100 percent metric,'' said Chris
Jones, program manager for JPL's Mars Surveyor Program.
``(Companies) continue to use the English system of units, and
that's something we have dealt with effectively on other
programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerns over another spacecraft, the Mars Polar Lander, due to
touch down near the planet's south pole December 3, are now on
everybody's mind. But Gavin said review teams are checking the
source of the error and are hard at work to make sure it doesn't
happen again.
</P>
<P>
   Gavin said mission directors for the Polar Lander have recruited
``the brightest groups of interplanetary people from industry and
everywhere else'' to make sure everyone speaks the same language
and uses the same arithmetic terms when the lander finally reaches
Mars.
</P>
<P>
   The orbiter was designed to be the world's first complete
weather satellite around another planet. Its mission was to collect
data about the Martian atmosphere, seek evidence of water vapor,
determine daily and seasonal weather patterns and find frost
deposits in the south polar regions of Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the mission of Mars Pathfinder in 1997, the Polar Lander
this time will not deploy a roving vehicle on the surface, but
instead will use a long flexible arm aboard the craft to scoop up
samples of Martian soil for analysis by instruments inside the
craft. And just a few minutes before it reaches the surface, the
Lander will fire two ``microprobes'' deep into the Martian ground
to see if water exists there.

NEW FIGURES SHOW BRADLEY HAS EDGE OVER GORE IN SUMMER
FUND  RAISING
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL and CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ The two presidential candidates generating the most
early excitement toured the Bay Area Thursday as new campaign
fund-raising reports gave them plenty to cheer about.
<P>
   Democrat Bill Bradley raised $6.7 million since July, surpassing
the assumed shoo-in candidate, Vice President Al Gore, in fund
raising for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Republican front-runner George W. Bush has raked in
$57 million so far _ 10 percent of it in California.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was in Silicon Valley Thursday, picking up campaign
checks at the Fairmont Hotel in San Jose, where he cashed out with
$400,000. The Democratic former New Jersey senator also held a
health care forum in Oakland as part of a three-day swing through
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who introduced a $65 billion proposal for health care
Tuesday, also picked up $500,000 at a fund-raiser at the Mark
Hopkins Hotel earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley had plenty of competition Thursday. Bush also was
crisscrossing high-tech turf, riding virtual roller coasters with
schoolkids at the Tech Museum of Innovation in San Jose, then
collecting $350,000 in Redwood City at a packed luncheon. Among
those on hand were movie legend and former Ambassador Shirley
Temple Black, C-Net CEO Halsey Minor _ once a chief booster of
President Clinton _ and former Secretary of State George Shultz.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign state chair Gerald Parsky said the Texas governor
had raised nearly $6.5 million in California alone. Bush, who has
$37 million in the bank, was expected to pick up $1 million in his
two days in California this week, his campaign said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also continues to outpace his Republican opponents.
Arizona Sen. John McCain was a distant second in fund raising,
collecting $3 million during the last three months and bringing his
total to $9.3 million. That includes $2 million transferred from
his Senate campaign account. Gary Bauer, Patrick &LR;  Buchanan,
Elizabeth Dole, Steve Forbes and Orrin Hatch each raised more than
$1 million from July through September.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference Thursday, Bush addressed the issue of
money _ and campaign finance reform _ and whether his campaign has
been so successful that he faces ``an embarrassment of riches.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a corrupt person, you'll be corrupted by money.
Honest people can't be corrupted by money,'' Bush said. ``I'm proud
of the accomplishments I've achieved ... when it comes to raising
money. I've had good success in that, and I'm grateful for that
success. ... It's an indication of a lot of support.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush said the also believes campaigns should be held
accountable for fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in instant disclosure. We ought to let the sun shine
in,'' the governor said. ``We ought to raise the limits of what
people can contribute to a campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bradley's campaign announced that it raised $6.7
million since July 1, spending about $4.2 million. This gives the
campaign $10 million in the bank, about the same amount as Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the figures, Bradley said he is still the underdog in
the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The numbers) are only a snapshot at a particular moment,'' he
told reporters Thursday. ``Life is volatile, campaigns are
volatile. We have to get known by more people. Forty or 45 percent
of the people in America don't know who I am. The key is letting
them know who I am, what I believe in, what I care for, &LR;  and what I
want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Emphasizing his underdog status, Bradley said he is up against
an ``entrenched power that is significant and that will be brought
to bear against us. ... It's symbolized by the vice president
arriving in Air Force Two and me arriving in Air Express or a
van.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's success has made state GOP leaders happy _ if only
because some of his magic may rub off. ``We're thrilled,'' said
state GOP Chairman John McGraw, who confirmed that the front-runner
has agreed to a fund-raiser for the California Republican Party in
November.
</P>
<P>
   But technology leaders said it is no surprise that the campaigns
are focusing on fund raising in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about our industry becoming what is a definition for the
economy ... the information technology industry,'' said Ray Lane,
president of Oracle. ``We represent 10 percent of the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lane said that while Gore has visited Silicon Valley numerous
times, Bush's success shows he's been able to sell ``a much more
balanced viewpoint'' of entrepreneurship in the valley than Clinton
and Gore combined.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Grady, a longtime Bush supporter, noted that both Bradley
and Bush appear to be reaping rewards in the same political turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing very well in the valley, no question,'' Grady said
of Bradley. ``He gets credit for being a thoughtful and ethical
person ... but I wonder if everyone knows what they're buying. ...
There could be some buyer's remorse coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   Before heading to Silicon Valley, Bradley participated in a
roundtable discussion with health care professionals at Oakland
Children's Hospital and met with about 200 supporters who
registered at his Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley repeatedly tried to downplay the momentum that has
others buzzing about his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we have momentum,'' Bradley said. ``I think we
have a little traction. We're going to continue to do what we have
been doing _ going out and meeting people and telling them what we
would like to do for the country.''

 EVIDENCE SHOWS NEANDERTHALS ATE THEIR OWN  &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   French and American researchers excavating a cave in
southeastern France have found the first clear evidence that
near-human Neanderthal people practiced cannibalism 100,000 years
ago, the scientists are reporting Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Fragments of Neanderthal bones, scattered around three hearths
in a fire-scarred cave, reveal striking cut marks that could have
been made only by sharp flints. Other bones obviously were smashed
by stone hammers before they were stripped of their flesh by flint
knives, the scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is conclusive evidence that at least some Neanderthals
practiced cannibalism,'' said paleontologist Tim White, director of
the Laboratory for Human Evolutionary Studies at the University of
California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   The French scientists, headed by archaeologist Alban Defleur,
have been excavating the cave site known as Moula-Guercy since
1991. It overlooks the Rhone river near the town of Soyons north of
Marseilles. In 1993 Defleur and his team uncovered puzzling bits of
Neanderthal bones at the site that appeared to show cut marks.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the team has dug with meticulous care through deeper
layers in the cave floor. Defleur has enlisted White, an authority
on early humans and their prehistoric kin, to make a detailed
examination of the bone fragments that have been dated at between
80,000 and 120,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The two scientists and three colleagues are reporting their
findings Friday in the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like a crime scene,'' White said in an interview
describing Defleur's work. ``You rope off the area to keep everyone
out, and then you pick up every tiny piece of evidence, you
assemble everything that fits, and then you analyze it all in the
lab.''
</P>
<P>
   Defleur even used tools of bamboo for his work rather than
metal, because metal could have left marks on the bones that
confused the scientists, White said.
</P>
<P>
   The short, brawny and large-browed Neanderthal people are
believed to have diverged on a dead-end branch of the human
evolutionary tree about 300,000 years ago. They died out about
30,000 years ago, well after Homo sapiens, the true humans, began
flourishing in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The Neanderthals were thus distant cousins of today's humans,
but they contributed little or nothing to the human gene pool.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows what caused them to vanish. Some scientists argue
they might have been driven to extinction by more advanced humans
occupying their territory and perhaps, at times, mating with them.
Whatever their fate, the Neanderthals are a mysterious people,
known now by little more than their bones, stone tools and caves.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have speculated for nearly a century that the
Neanderthals practiced cannibalism. One cave in Croatia recently
yielded a complete skeleton that had been stripped of all its flesh
_ presumably to eat it before a ritual burial of the bones, some
researchers have suggested.
</P>
<P>
   White himself has excavated remains of the cliff-dwelling
Anasazi people who lived in the American Southwest before A.D.
1000, and vanished around A.D. 1300. He has found suggestive
evidence that some of them may have also practiced cannibalism.
</P>
<P>
   The bone fragments in the Moula-Guercy cave, however, are the
first to show ``unequivocal evidence'' that they were smashed to
yield soft tissues and marrow for eating, White and Defleur
concluded in their report.
</P>
<P>
   The 78 bone fragments appear to have come from at least six
individuals, including two Neanderthal adults, two teenagers about
16 or 17 years old and two small children only 6 or 7.
</P>
<P>
   Their skulls were smashed apart to get at the nutritious brain
tissue, Defleur and White report. And one group of fragments,
pieced together, reveals the thigh bone of an adult that shows
where a stone hammer bashed the bone apart to recover its fatty,
nutritious marrow.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered among the fragmented bones of the people were similar
fragments of several animals. They have been identified by
Defleur's associate, Patria Valensi, as coming mostly from a
species of red deer that were butchered in the same way as the
Neanderthals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We interpret these data to indicate that the hominid and deer
carcasses were butchered ... with the objective being the removal
of soft tissues and marrow,'' the scientists say in their report.
</P>
<P>
   Defleur is continuing the excavation at Moula-Guercy, and last
summer five undergraduates from UC Berkeley joined his research
team. Meanwhile, Defleur has joined White's group excavating in
Ethiopia to seek more knowledge of the earliest humans.

   1. AIDS EPIDEMIC ABOUT TO WIPE OUT THE FEW ACHIEVEMENTS
</P>
<P>
   OF DEVELOPMENT IN AFRICA It is now generally agreed that, given
the rate at which it is progressing in Africa, the Aids epidemic
will soon wipe out the benefits that development has brought that
continent. The disease is no longer just a health disaster for
Africa, where it kills 2 million people a year and infects 4
million others. The pandemic is a threat to Africa's social
cohesion, economic situation and population equilibrium. By
Nathaniel Herzberg. From Le Monde. 1,200 words. (English
translation available.)

FRANCE SHOPS FOR ANOTHER PRETTY FACE The statue of Marianne that
graces French town halls is a symbol of the French Republic. Early
statues show a young woman with a helmet on her head and armour
over her breast. Later, actresses Brigitte Bardot and Catherine
Deneuve posed for the statues. As the 21st century dawns, does
France need a new pretty face in a skimpy dress as a national
symbol? And if so, which one? Of the five finalists chosen by the
36,000-member Association of French Mayors in a competition for a
new Marianne statue (to be unveiled in November,) two of the women
are supermodels, one is a game-show host, one a singer and one a
television news anchor. Critics say the choice of a new Marianne
should be more than a beauty pageant. By Suzanne Daley. From The
New York Times. 1,200 words. (Please contact us for availability
your country.)

EARTHQUAKES : A MATTER OF LUCK, MOST OF IT BAD Even though the rate
of earthquakes over time seems to be more or less unchanging, the
world's population explosion means that more people are moving into
quake zones, which are often near coasts. The result is the
prospect of continuing trauma as urban areas erupt with what seems
like nearly endless bursts of destruction. By William J. Broad. New
York Times Science Times. 2,000 words + photo + graphic.

to allow Russian overflights stalled the issue long enough for NATO
troops to be on the ground and block the plan for a separate

LEARNING TO LOVE NEANDERTHALS In the spring of 1999, newspapers
worldwide reported the discovery in Portugal of the skeleton of a
4-year-old child, dead for 25,000 years. A ground-breaking and
controversial claim was made : that the skeleton shows traces of
both Neanderthal and modern human ancestry, evidence that modern
humans did not simply extinguish the Neanderthals. The two kinds of
human were so alike that in Portugal, at least, they intermingled
for thousands of years. By Robert Kunzig. From Discover Magazine.

   DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE: In praise of chinaberries
</P>
<P>
   (Eds: A photo of Margery P. Dews is available by calling
404-526-5456.)
</P>
<P>
   (''Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share with Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray
their memories of growing up in small-town America. The way we
remember it, life back then was like a dream.)
</P>
<P>
   By Margery P. Dews
</P>
<P>
   Special to Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   EDISON, Ga. _ To a person who has never spent hours stringing
chinaberries with a strong needle and No. 50 cotton thread, there
is little hope of explaining the pastime of those days when life
was simpler and people were uncomplicated.
</P>
<P>
   Chinaberries are almost a thing of the past even in their
Southern stronghold because most of the old hedgerows and ditches
where they flourished are gone now.
</P>
<P>
   Chinaberry trees, also called the Chinese Umbrella tree, were an
essential feature of all rural yards in our part of the South.
</P>
<P>
   Generous of shade, their growing habits made them perfect
``climbing trees'' with outreaching branches, not-too-frightening
height and enough leafy twigs to conceal anyone wanting to hide
from authority.
</P>
<P>
   Our chinaberry tree grew at the edge of the woodpile. It was a
prize conceit of my playmates and myself that, from a standing
start, we could jump upward to catch hold of the lowest limb, swing
legs around it and, by skillful maneuvering, be peering out above
the top of the tree in less than five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   About mid-May the nondescript, sickly sweet-scented purple
blooms had fallen and been replaced by the hard, green,
English-pea-sized berries which would later shrivel, turn a
disgustingly mottled brown and smell to high heaven when crushed.
</P>
<P>
   They were never called just ``berries.'' Berries were something
to eat, and nothing on earth would eat a chinaberry, at least by
choice or preference.
</P>
<P>
   But the warmer weather and longer daylight hours for playing
outdoors gave us time for such a variety of activities that sooner
or later someone would suggest making chinaberry garlands,
necklaces, belts and bracelets.
</P>
<P>
   Any old needle would do, but an embroidery needle was much to be
prized since its big ``eye'' not only made it easier to thread
while perched on the largest branch but also pierced a larger hole
in the chinaberry for security and ease.
</P>
<P>
   The standard necklace was a single strand about 40 inches long,
looking to us like the pearls the ladies of the rotogravure and
magazines wore in those days.
</P>
<P>
   Various other designs sometimes appeared, created by the more
industrious and fanciful among us. Double strands were made for
headbands and, often, triple strands for belts.
</P>
<P>
   An old dress or gathered shirt of Mother's, reaching to ankle
length, a pair of the brightest colored shoes available and a full
assortment of chinaberry jewelry transformed the homeliest little
girl into a gypsy fortune-teller, Spanish dancer or Lady Vere de
Vere arriving for tea, Dutch bob or not.
</P>
<P>
   The grandeur of appearance and sheer aplomb would never again be
equaled although many a young woman dressing for her junior-senior
prom subconsciously hoped for a similar poise.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the self-assurance she had experienced when festooned
with the heavy, opulent-like green stands of chinaberries she had
so painstakingly constructed while sitting cross-legged under the
tree or precariously aloft.
</P>

   LATHAM-COLUMN _ MARSHALL, Texas _ Consider today's column a
gift. Certainly it was a gift to me. It came wrapped directly from
cyberspace, from people in various parts of North America who
happened to read the column about my friend who committed a random
act of kindness. (Latham, Marshall News Messenger) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ If the DAR can welcome
immigrants from around the world into the United States as
full-fledged citizens, then it sure makes all those
Johnny-come-lately Americans look small when they try to slam the
immigration door behind them now that they have their citizenship.
(Rowland Nethaway is the senior editor of the Waco Tribune-Herald)
MOVED
</P>
<P>
   HARDBODY-COLUMN _ LONGVIEW, Texas _ For the love of a pickup
truck, all eyes were on Longview last week ... or so it seemed.
Thanks to the ``Hands On A Hardbody'' endurance test and S.R.
Bindler's documentary about the 1995 contest, Longview is garnering
not just national, but international fame as the home of folks who
would do just about anything for the keys to a new pickup truck.
The problem with this newfound attention is that no one knows
whether it will make Longview famous or infamous. (Litterski,
Longview News-Journal) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ The GOP has its long knives out again for the
environment, loading 13 appropriations bills with 58 riders that,
like a street gang on a tear, would vandalize the national
neighborhood. Why does the party keep doing this stuff? Republicans
virtually invented conservation under President Theodore Roosevelt
and threw in with modern environmental protection under President
Richard Nixon. (Tom Teepen is national correspondent for Cox
Newspapers.) MOVED THURSDAY FOR SUNDAY.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ The lease on my automobile soon running out,
I am in the market for a car. As I prowl between intensive salesmen
who want my name, address and phone number before they'll allow me
to open the driver's side door of a showroom car, I have come to
the realization that the auto industry _ both foreign and domestic
_ does not meet my needs. (Howard Kleinberg is a columnist for Cox
News Service.) MOVED THURSDAY FOR SUNDAY.
</P>
<P>
   GLASS-COLUMN _ WASHINGTON _ As the official photographer
obliged, my wife recalled the bid we'd received from beyond the
confines of the Executive Mansion. ``Mr. President,'' she said, ``I
hope people will be able to tell if it's you or if it's a cardboard
cutout.''
</P>
<P>
   If her jest carried an edge, he missed it. Inclined to quiet
chuckles, this time Ronald Reagan laughed uproariously. ``Yes,'' he
said, ``that's the trouble with this town. It's hard to tell the
difference between a phony fake and a real fake.''
</P>
<P>
   That scene, from more than a decade ago, came in mind while
reading reviews of ``Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan,'' Edmund
Morris's newly published and widely controversial book. (Andy Glass
is a columnist for Cox News Service in the Washington bureau.)

 &HT;    Stories from around the country tell of random acts of kindness
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ Consider today's column a gift. Certainly it
was a gift to me.
</P>
<P>
   It came wrapped directly from cyberspace, from people in various
parts of North America who happened to read the column about my
friend who committed a random act of kindness.
</P>
<P>
   My friend found himself blessed then, and still, by spending
$1.72 to pay for the drive in order of food for the person behind
him.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the column from across the country was astounding of
people who either did their own random acts of kindness or who were
the recipients. These are their stories, but in the true spirit of
random kindness, I'm only identifying them by one of their names
and hometowns. The best part of a random act is as few people
knowing as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Val from Vancouver was in line at the grocery store and the
woman ahead of her was trying to cut down on her shopping list
because she did not have enough in welfare vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   People behind her were muttering, but what Val noticed was that
the items the woman was having to put back weren't donuts or candy,
they were the essentials such as milk, orange juice and bread.
</P>
<P>
   When the woman had pared down enough to make her purchase, Val
told the cashier to put the items on her bill and bag them for the
lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``What made me want to cry was when this lady shook my hand and
said that I would be in her thoughts as she fed her children. It
was a big reminder to me that I am very well off in a thousand
different ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Val, who must run with a good crowd, also has a friend who
regularly pays for the five cars behind her going through the
highway toll booth.
</P>
<P>
   Judith of Scottsdale, Ariz., says she does, from time to time,
pay for the meal of the person directly behind her in line where
she works, at Arizona State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a little known fact,'' she writes, ``that such random
acts do far more for the `do-er' than the receiver. The Bible tells
us this, too! It's best to do them in secret.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus her favorite memory is when she paid out a layaway for a
friend who was saving to attend the seminary.
</P>
<P>
   ``(She) was shocked when she went to make a payment and found it
was all paid for. To this day she does not know who did it. I have
only told one or two people that story. It is one of my most
treasured memories.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks for passing it along to us, Judith. It made our day, too.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps you'd like to know what it feels like to be the
``victim'' of a random act of kindness? Ask Marilou of Pine, Ariz.
She even remembers the exact day it happened.
</P>
<P>
   Marilou was celebrating her 69th birthday on Aug. 15, 1998 at
the Nifty Fifth Diner.
</P>
<P>
   Another couple, who Marilou did not know, was sitting at the
table next to her group and ate their meal in silence, got up and
left.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, the waitress came over and asked if it was really
her birthday. When she confirmed that it was, the waitress said
that the man at the table, who had already gone, had paid for any
dessert she would like.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, that made my day and I will always remember it
with a warm glow.''
</P>
<P>
   The point here is, it doesn't take much to make a lasting
memory.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, my favorite story about a $5 random act of
kindness, again from Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Schwartz and his wife of Phoenix happened to be in a used
book store one day when they saw two men in their 20s discussing a
particular volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``One had pulled a small book from the shelf and was showing it
to the other man,'' Mr. Schwartz writes. ``He was leafing through
the book showing the other passages here and there. He spoke with
such zeal and fervor about the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said to his friend, `When I scrape enough money together,
I'm going to buy this book.' He put the book back on the shelf and
they walked a short distance away.''
</P>
<P>
   Having heard so many good things about the book, Mr. Schwartz
was curious about it and wanted to know what it was.
</P>
<P>
   The topic was the life of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   He looked inside the cover and saw that the book cost $5. He
stuck a $5 bill inside the book, walked over to the man and said,
``I want you to have this book.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was taken aback and thanked me profusely. We left the
store. My day was made. I was on a high.''
</P>
<P>
   Want to know something else? Indeed, you might have already
guessed. You see, Mr. Schwartz isn't a Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Keep doing random acts and I'll keep telling about them. I hope
I never run out.

 &HT;    Young people losing touch with America; service is in order
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ My mother's chapter of the Daughters of the
American Revolution hands out the Stars and Stripes to new citizens
of the United States at their swearing-in ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   The little flags given to brand-new U.S. citizens are a
``welcome aboard'' gesture by the DAR, an organization whose
members are blood-line descendents of soldiers and partisans who
fought in the war that achieved American independence.
</P>
<P>
   If the DAR can welcome immigrants from around the world into the
United States as full-fledged citizens, then it sure makes all
those Johnny-come-lately Americans look small when they try to slam
the immigration door behind them now that they have their
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   The DAR is not concerned about the ethnic or cultural heritage
of the people who accept the U.S. flags. DAR members want the new
citizens to know that they now owe their allegiance to a
democratic, freedom-loving nation that was founded and preserved by
the sacrifices of generations of earlier citizens.
</P>
<P>
   New U.S. citizens are entitled to the same protections, freedoms
and opportunities as the men and women who can prove direct descent
from ancestors who fought to establish this great nation. Besides
being the world's richest, most powerful nation, the United States
also happens to be the planet's oldest representative democracy.
</P>
<P>
   When my mother told me how she looked forward to handing out the
small flags to new citizens, I remembered thinking that America's
newest citizens should understand that the privileges of
citizenship are accompanied by responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, I thought, a national-service requirement of some sort
should be a precondition for immigrants who seek to become U.S.
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Then I realized that America's newest citizens are likely to be
much more aware of their citizenship responsibilities than
born-and-bred Americans who take their citizenship for granted.
</P>
<P>
   To be born an American is effortless good luck. To be a
responsible citizen, however, requires effort and sacrifice that
partly repays the nation for the privileges and protections
extended to all citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Americans who think their citizenship responsibilities ended
with birth endanger America's ability to sustain the blessings of
democracy and liberty to ourselves and our posterity.
</P>
<P>
   America needs a universal service requirement for all citizens,
not just immigrants who apply for citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   One of the casualties of the Vietnam War was the military draft,
which was killed in 1973 by nervous politicians to appease anti-war
protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Lost with the death of the military draft was a valuable means
to vest new generations of young Americans in their nation. Due to
the draft, generations of Americans were enlisted in the service of
their country, to the benefit of the draftees as well as their
nation. That tradition of national service has been broken.
</P>
<P>
   More Americans are becoming disconnected with their government _
the government they should be working to improve _ while
complaining louder and demanding more. Many of these citizens have
never lifted a finger in the service of their country.
</P>
<P>
   A universal service requirement would teach new generations of
Americans that citizenship privileges must be paid for with
citizenship responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Draft-age young men and women could work in retirement homes,
hospitals or national forests. They could rebuild America's
crumbling roads and bridges. They could attack urban blight. They
could mentor, teach, register voters or serve in the military.
</P>
<P>
   In return for their service, they would receive education
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Uncle Sam wants you, and you need Uncle Sam.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Big hearts and tough hands in Texas contest
 &HT;    By Pete Litterski
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ For the love of a pickup truck, all eyes were
on Longview last week ... or so it seemed.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the ``Hands On A Hardbody'' endurance test and S.R.
Bindler's documentary about the 1995 contest, Longview is garnering
not just national, but international fame as the home of folks who
would do just about anything for the keys to a new pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   The wave of media coverage focused on last week's contest at Joe
Mallard Nissan was the biggest thing to hit town since Longview
hosted one of several premiers of the movie ``A Time to Kill,''
which starred Matt McConaughey, who like his buddy Bindler, grew up
in Longview.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with this newfound attention is that no one knows
whether it will make Longview famous or infamous.
</P>
<P>
   After all, any auto dealer looking for a little publicity can
park a pickup (or, outside of Texas, a car) in the middle of the
parking lot and let a couple dozen contenders see who can keep a
hand in the contest the longest.
</P>
<P>
   But, perhaps only East Texas can come up with the characters who
have apparently won the hearts and the funny bones of movie-goers
across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   It seems we offer everything from melodrama to humor when folks
gather around a pickup in East Texas. From this year's tear-jerking
story of a mother who needed a better vehicle to transport her
ailing child to Shreveport for doctor's appointments to past
contestants who have seen magnificent visions in their
sleep-deprived delusions, there have always been tangential plot
lines every bit as interesting as the question of who will win the
truck each year.
</P>
<P>
   One of my favorite tales from this year's contest was of the
contestant who sacrificed his chance at victory by lifting his
hands off the truck and catching a fellow contestant who had
drifted off to sleep and was falling backwards. I'm convinced his
downfall was the result of a good heart and not
</P>
<P>
   a mental lapse, such as that suffered last year by a contestant
who was listening to music and lifted both hands off the truck to
adjust his headphones well into the competition.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, I hope movie-goers, television viewers and newspaper
readers around the world will look upon Longview with a beneficent
eye. Over the years, the people in these contests have been our
neighbors and friends. They're good folks with big hearts and hardy
feet.
</P>
<P>
   I ought to know. The 1995 winner in Bindler's movie showed up
just about a year ago to help my family move a few blocks into our
new house. We had met only a couple of times at Thanksgiving
dinners hosted by the family of my wife's best friend. But when his
niece put out a call for help when we were moving, he showed up.
</P>
<P>
   I guess you could say I was moved by a ``Hardbody.''

 &HT;    Woodworkers should spend wisely
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I received an e-mail recently from a gentleman who
asked for the single best tip I would give a beginning woodworker,
which is sort of like presenting me with a pound of Godiva
chocolates and asking me to pick the best piece in the box.
</P>
<P>
   He did rule out a lecture on patience, and that wouldn't have
been my first choice anyway, unless I knew from experience that my
subject was an impatient and impulsive person.
</P>
<P>
   My answer is going to have to be equivocal, because in practice
it would be chosen after a discussion with this hypothetical
beginner, to learn more about the personality and the general
situation.
</P>
<P>
   If the beginner isn't particularly well-to-do financially, I
would warn against buying tools based on price rather than quality.
Fine woodworking is a very expensive proposition, as anyone who's
involved in it can attest. In any class of tools, from chisels to
table saws, you can usually buy great ones, good ones,
conditionally acceptable ones and worthless ones.
</P>
<P>
   Great ones are usually out of reach of anyone but a successful
professional shop or the rich amateur. Good ones are what we
generally want to invest in. Worthless ones are to be avoided.
Conditionally acceptable ones are usually large power tools and
we'll discuss that momentarily.
</P>
<P>
   Let's look at chisels for an example. The great chisels are made
in Japan. They are works of art in and of themselves, and a single
chisel from the forge of a great maker can cost more than $100. And
even then it might not be terribly useful unless it was intended
for export, because Japanese woodworkers generally use much softer
wood than we do.
</P>
<P>
   The less expensive Japanese chisels, and English chisels,
generally fall under the heading of good ones. Keep them sharp and
they'll do the work for you.
</P>
<P>
   Hardware-store chisels such as Stanley's cheapest line are too
small, won't hold an edge and are generally carelessly made. In
this case, the difference in price between good chisels and poor
ones is so small the decision is easy.
</P>
<P>
   Conditionally acceptable tools are things like table or radial
arm saws which work well enough if kept in good condition, but
resist that condition. They constantly fall out of alignment. If
you don't have a good deal of mechanical and engineering talent and
training, they fall in the unacceptable range. If you have that
talent, and can't afford anything better, take a chance.
</P>
<P>
   So, you say, you can't afford to pay $800 for a contractor's saw
or $1,500 for a big table saw? You want to go with that $300
department store model?
</P>
<P>
   I can certainly understand. I've been there myself. I went with
the $300 table saw. Then I went with the $350 radial arm saw. I am
what you might call a slow learner.
</P>
<P>
   If you go with the cheapest tools, one of two things is going to
happen. The best outcome will be that you learn your lesson, bite
the bullet and buy something you can actually use. The other
possibility, unfortunately, is that you will abandon woodworking
and take up macrame.
</P>
<P>
   What ever happened to macrame, anyway?

   TV-ANIMAL-FARM (Undated) _ The live-action, animatronically
stunning ``Animal Farm,'' debuting Sunday on TNT, is a stark study
of the egalitarian ideals but untenable realities of communism. The
movie is the continuation of a heartening trend of bringing the
classics to television. And after this stirring version, hopefully
more than a few students will want to read the book. By MARK

 &HT;    Drug can prevent stroke-related disability for patients who seek
care quickly
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Without TPA, Michael Miller is sure his legs
wouldn't have been almost fully working three weeks after his Aug.
26 stroke. Libby Ahern doubts if she would be alive.
</P>
<P>
   Tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) has been minimizing stroke
damage by dissolving blood clots since 1996, but it's still not
widely known that people can spare themselves a lifetime disability
by hustling to the hospital when stroke symptoms first appear.
People receiving TPA within three hours of the onset of the most
common type of stroke are 30 percent more likely to have little or
no impairment a year later, the New England Journal of Medicine
reported in June.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal study didn't look at TPA's immediate impact, but Dr.
Kenneth Pugar has seen it a few times. ``We see a number of people
just literally get better in hours after we give the drug,'' says
the Kettering Medical Center neurologist. ``And we've had a couple
of very dramatic ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahern was one of them. ``It really works,'' says the 75-year-old
Kettering woman, whose sister died of a stroke before TPA was
available.
</P>
<P>
   Ahern was in a Meijer checkout lane just after midnight of
Christmas Eve morning in 1997. She was lining her groceries up on
the counter and suddenly her hand froze.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill looked at me and said, `What's the matter?' `` Ahern says
of her husband. She tried to answer but couldn't talk. She
remembers someone calling 911 and someone else moving her groceries
to another lane. But after being carried into the ambulance,
everything else from the next 24 hours is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad said it was like somebody sort of popped her with a pin
in the checkout lane,'' says Ahern's daughter, Val Alvey. ``She
just kind of melted.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvey heard from her brother a little after 12:30 a.m., but he
was crying so hard, she couldn't understand a word. ``I thought it
was a prank,'' she says. ``So I hung up.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Alvey reached the hospital at 1:15, her mother was
``totally out of it. She couldn't talk, couldn't move, nothing.''
Ahern's right side was rigid and turned inward, and the only
movement of her left side appeared to be involuntary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her right side was totally paralyzed and she couldn't see
anything off to the right,'' Pugar says. ``This was a major, major
stroke.''
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't any question about Ahern's stroke symptoms, but
sometimes they're easier to ignore. Miller, for example, felt his
feet going numb as he walked into his Versailles home. ``I poured a
cup of coffee and carried it into the other room OK, but then I
went to drink it and it spilled into my lap,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Any sudden numbness, tingling, slurring or loss of speech, or
loss of muscular control on one side of the body is a likely
indicator of a stroke, says the American Stroke Association, a
division of the American Heart Association. Strokes are caused by
either blood clots or hemorrhages that keep blood away from part of
the brain. Deprived of oxygen and other nutrients in the blood, the
brain cells begin dying.
</P>
<P>
   TPA, used for more than 10 years to dissolve cardiac blood
clots, works only for the 85 percent of strokes that are ischemic,
or caused by blood clots. Another group of patients can't use it
because of their other medical conditions or medications. So the
three-hour window when TPA is useful must include enough time for
the examination and CAT scan to make sure TPA won't do more harm
than good.
</P>
<P>
   After Ahern qualified, Pugar told her children it was an option.
He said it could dissolve the blood clot and help her, it could be
ineffective or it could ``dissolve everything and she would bleed
to death,'' Alvey says. Her mother had a good chance of dying even
without the treatment, and status quo survival didn't look very
appealing as she lay motionless and mute.
</P>
<P>
   Following protocol, Pugar gave Ahern 10 percent of the liquid
dose in a minute or so, then hooked the rest up to a vein in her
hand like any IV drip. It all takes about an hour. ``While I was
giving the drug, she started moving her leg for me,'' Pugar says.
</P>
<P>
   As Alvey paced past Ahern's door about half an hour into the
treatment, a nurse signaled thumbs up and beckoned her inside.
``She started moving her right hand,'' Alvey says. ``Next thing I
knew, she was looking around the room and trying to focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahern wouldn't be out of danger for 24 hours, doctors said, but
she kept improving. Her speech was slurred, but she was talking.
She was 70 percent or 80 percent improved by the next day, Pugar
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Pugar looked at her on Christmas morning and said, `I want
you to know this is the best Christmas present I ever had,' ``
Alvey says. Ahern was alert enough by then to remember the visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what he was talking about,'' she says. ``I
didn't realize he had saved my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The 730,000 strokes a year in this country are its leading cause
of disability and third-ranked cause of death. The annual rate of
31.9 stroke deaths per 100,000 people in Montgomery County, Ohio,
is 23 percent higher than the national rate, says the Miami Valley
American Heart Association. And about one-third of strokes strike
people younger than 65 such as Miller, a 50-year-old plumber.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's entire left side was numb, but he never lost
consciousness or the ability to speak. Dr. Lawrence Goldstick gave
him the lowdown on TPA risks directly, he says. ``I told him, `You
do whatever you think is best.' What could I say, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   At his worst, Miller lost movement of his left leg and arm and
some of his right leg. Within three weeks, movement in his right
leg had fully returned. He could control and stand on his left leg
and walk with a cane. He could lift his recently limp left arm to
his side and pull it back to his body.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very encouraging from where I was,'' he says. ``I'm
pretty confident of getting it all back.''
</P>
<P>
   Pugar can't say for sure that TPA stops any particular stroke in
its tracks. ``There are some who have rapid improvement without any
treatment,'' he concedes. But his gut tells him TPA made the
difference in Libby Ahern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's wonderful,'' says Ahern, who's back to doing the
cooking and housework and pretty much everything she used to do.
``It's too bad more people don't get there in time to get help.''

   WELFARE, Texas _ Grunts of pleasure and clouds of dust fill the
cool morning air as Angharad Rees carries a bucket of grain toward
her impatient four-legged friends, who jostle for a position at
feeding tins.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I go over there without feed, I'm in trouble,'' Rees said
with a joking twinkle.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of their swine kind who wind up as chops, links and
rinds, these lucky porkers are living in hog heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Even the mention of bacon is considered tasteless at the Safe
Harbour Pig Refuge, home to 75 oinkers, including Vietnamese
potbellied pigs, feral hogs and a Russian boar named _ what else? _
Boris Boarloff.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of them have names, and they all have a story,'' said
Rees, a 46-year-old nurse whose porcine preoccupation has earned
her the name of ``Pig Lady.''
</P>
<P>
   Although always an animal lover, the strapping, red-haired woman
never intended to create a hog resort when she got her first
piglet, a Dukor Yorkshire named Mama Louie, around 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But then her heart wouldn't let her turn away a homeless pig
named Tank, and the course was set in 1995 when she bought four
potbellied pigs for $5 at an auction on the steps of the Bandera
County Courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was afraid they'd end up barbecued,'' said Rees, whose
Welfare refuge is 50 miles northwest of San Antonio. Rees does not
eat pork but said she does eat beef and other meat.
</P>
<P>
   They just kept coming after that, and the family's 17-acre
homestead is dotted with large pens where pigs weighing up to 400
pounds lounge in the shade while awaiting the next visit of their
dedicated human savior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the only pig refuge in the state, as far as I know,'' Rees
said recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take in pigs that have had human contact, and we try to
adopt them out to good, loving homes,'' she said. ``Not all pigs
are suitable for adoption.''
</P>
<P>
   Her clientele has grown to 75 pigs from 14 in the past 18
months, and, she said: ``I get more calls every week, primarily
from people with found pigs, or those who can't keep them as pets
any longer.''
</P>
<P>
   The monthly grain bill of $450 is putting a pinch on the
family's pocketbook, so Rees has applied with the Internal Revenue
Service for a tax designation as a nonprofit charity to encourage
donations.
</P>
<P>
   She spends about four hours a day caring for her extended family
that also includes 25 cats, six dogs, five rabbits, one parrot and
``a sundry of fowl.''
</P>
<P>
   The menagerie is remarkably clean and orderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had worse neighbors,'' said Jerry Tilley, who owns the
nearby PoPo Family Restaurant in this Kendall County community.
``We've never sensed an aroma. The biggest problem is an occasional
pig who wants to see what the world's all about, and we help round
them up.''
</P>
<P>
   Rees, whose first name means ``safe harbor'' in the Celtic
language, has become a crusader for pig appreciation _ outside of
culinary circles. She uses the hogs to educate elementary students
about animal cruelty and proper pig care. She also has taken
piglets to work at the Vitas Hospice in San Antonio, where
terminally ill patients and their families cuddle and feed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pigs are always the brunt of somebody's joke,'' Rees said.
``What people don't realize is pigs are very loving, social
animals, and they all have personalities.''

TNT STAGES A COUP IN `ANIMAL FARM' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the Emmy Awards last month, ``Politically Incorrect''
host Bill Maher did a skit about the future of television. Too
late: The future is here.
</P>
<P>
   Its name is ``Animal Farm.''
</P>
<P>
   George Orwell wrote this rural allegory about the Soviet Union
in 1945. But it took more than a half-century for television
technology to actually catch up.
</P>
<P>
   The live-action, animatronically stunning ``Animal Farm,''
debuting at 8 p.m. Sunday on TNT, is a stark study of the
egalitarian ideals but untenable realities of communism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Animal Farm'' the movie is the continuation of a heartening
trend of bringing the classics to television. And after this
stirring version, hopefully more than a few students will want to
read the book, rather than be merely compelled to do so by English
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The plot centers on the battle between the evil two-legged
talkers and righteous four-legged talkers, and how a group of
intelligent animals take control of their farm and, presumably,
their destiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Animalkind is born to a miserable, laborious and short
existence,'' says the leader pig, Old Major (Peter Ustinov), in a
speech that sounds absolutely Churchillian and paraphrases Thomas
Hobbes. ``Man. Man is our enemy. Remove man, and the root cause of
hunger and overwork is abolished forever. Remove man and overnight
we will become free and equal.''
</P>
<P>
   Old Major (read: Karl Marx) accidentally dies at the hands of
brutal farmer Jones (Pete Postlethwaite), prompting the revolution
led by Snowball (read: Trotsky, voiced by Kelsey Grammer) and
Napoleon (Josef Stalin, voiced by Patrick Stewart). The revolution
is triumphant, and the dastardly humans are driven from the
property that is renamed Animal Farm.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a dark, dark story of how man, or in this case, pig,
can lay to waste ideals in favor of personal power or comfort.
Power is wrested from rivals and the masses by the pig ruling class
via false vilification, food shortages, nationalistic rantings and
even propaganda films made by Squealer (Ian Holm), who is most akin
to Nazi propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels. We know what happened to
the Soviet Union. We know what happens here.
</P>
<P>
   The cast is the kind that only cable can put together for
television: Grammer, Stewart, Julia Ormond, Postlethwaite, Holm,
Paul Scofield and Ustinov, among others.
</P>
<P>
   But the real stars are the animatronic animals, created by Jim
Henson's Creature Shop technicians in conjunction with Hallmark
Entertainment and enhanced by computer-generated animation. Take
Napoleon: At a gathering of press critics in July, he appeared
onstage opposite alter-ego Stewart and Executive Producer Robert
Halmi Sr. Of course, in W.C. Fields tradition, the pig stole the
show as he explained his life as an actor: ``It's certainly better
than being eaten.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a surreal moment, talking to, and later touching, this
mass of computer chips, servos, silicone, hand-laid hair and
hydraulics. As with watching the movie, you easily suspend
disbelief. This is a talking pig.
</P>
<P>
   There was another attempt at bringing the book to film, a 1954
animated version that reviewers said fell short.
</P>
<P>
   But from Sunday night on, we will remember only one version. Its
name is ``Animal Farm,'' and the telling story from the past in
this movie of today may tell us even more about television's
tomorrow.

   STOCKBRIDGE, Mass. _ Not everyone in the
postcard-picture-perfect Berkshires is thinking autumn, despite the
rapid color changes that are taking place in the Massachusetts
foliage.
</P>
<P>
   Margarite Gigliotti, proprietor of the New Ashford Inn, a modest
motel on Route 7 some 9 miles south of Williamstown, touts a
different season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think snow!'' proclaims the sign at the entrance to the inn,
which Gigliotti and her husband, Francis, built in 1968 and have
operated since.
</P>
<P>
   Fall is young, and last week the leaf-peepers who flock to this
area and other parts of New England had yet to emerge in full
force. But, as the sign at the New Ashford Inn reminded us, it
won't be long before the hardwood trees are barren.
</P>
<P>
   Which means winter is coming, a season that ski operators at
nearby Jiminy Peak and Brodie (not to mention every other downhill
mountain in the Northeast) are praying will be kinder than in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Gigliotti, other motel owners and restaurateurs in western
Massachusetts also would appreciate a full-fledged winter this
year, one in which it snows early and often and one without rain.
As for Gigliotti's sign, she conceded with a warm twinkle that it
is up year-round. It is their calling card, a conversation piece.
</P>
<P>
   Their five children, now all grown and away from home, loved
skiing the region's slopes. The sign is a tribute to them, and a
reminder to their parents. The Gigliotti sons looked forward to
winter more than any other time. It was their favorite season.
</P>
<P>
   For those of us who prefer the kaleidoscope of colors autumn
offers, this may be the finest season. 'Tis the harvest, a time for
celebrating. The sun rises later; night descends earlier. Yet the
days, warm and welcoming, are more summer than winter.
</P>
<P>
   On the final Monday in September, a humid, balmy day that began
with a sweater that was shed by mid-morning, I explored the
Berkshires' Route 7 corridor, meandering south from Williamstown to
the Great Barrington border.
</P>
<P>
   Fall foliage information on the Massachusetts' visitors hot
line, 800-227-MASS, had reported that on the day I was visiting the
color was 15 to 25 percent in the western Berkshires. That, in
fact, depended on where you were looking.
</P>
<P>
   Walking the tidy lawns at the Norman Rockwell Museum just
outside Stockbridge, looking beyond the Housatonic River walk to a
panorama of rolling hills, I saw closer to 40 percent color. Yet
some of the maple and locust trees near the museum were as green as
they had been in July.
</P>
<P>
   Fall happens at its own pace, affecting each tree and shrub
differently. Much of the sumac along Route 7 is at peak color now,
a flaming corsage for drivers and their passengers, yet trees
flanking beaver ponds and farmers' fields are two to three weeks
from their final glory days of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The Berkshire communities may not have invented tourism, but
they have mastered it. There are museums big and small sprinkled
throughout the region, from the nationally prominent Massachusetts
Museum of Contemporary Art in North Adams, the Clark Art Institute
in Williamstown and the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, to
less-well-known treasures, such as the Berkshire Scenic Railway in
Lenox or Herman Melville's Arrowhead in Pittsfield.
</P>
<P>
   Stockbridge and West Stockbridge are my favorite spots to walk
about. Said Rockwell, ``I just love Stockbridge. I mean,
Stockbridge is the best of America, the best of New England.''
</P>
<P>
   His observation is just as true today as it was a half-century
or more ago when he said it.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Lion Inn, at the intersection of Routes 7 and 102, is a
historic draw in the heart of the village. Famous for its food, as
well as its ambience, the inn is a popular spot for couples to
pause and take photographs of one another. Two doors down, to the
east, stands the Yankee Candle Co.
</P>
<P>
   Does this place know how to market itself, or what? Tour buses
roar in and out of Stockbridge all day long, but they seem to be
fewer in fall than during summer. At the Norman Rockwell Museum,
there were as many cars with Florida license plates as either
Massachusetts or New York. Hard to say if these visitors were
simply wise enough to get away during hurricane season or, in the
upstate New York tradition, they were ``snowbirds,'' retired with
winter homes in the Sunshine State.
</P>
<P>
   The famous painter's oldest son, Peter Rockwell, was a sculptor.
Some of his impressive works, as varied as a Rodin-like couple
dancing to an Aztec-style creation blasted out of stone, decorate
the landscape at the museum. Because the indoor exhibitions change
regularly, it is a spot to return to time and again.
</P>
<P>
   I could not leave the area without stopping by the Berkshire
Brewery &AMP; Restaurant in the Jenifer House Commons on Route 7, just
north of Great Barrington. John, a good friend for more than 30
years, lives not far away and belongs to a synagogue around the
corner. We made plans to meet for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   The lone brew-pub in the region, Berkshire Brewery, makes hearty
food and even better beer. John and I each sipped a pint of a
seasonal Oktoberfest, a heavily hopped, malty brown ale that seemed
a perfect salute to autumn.
</P>
<P>
   We sat under a canopy outdoors, admiring the hop vines growing
up the side of the barn. At the table next to us, two men discussed
Christmas trees, techniques for delivering them and what price they
will fetch this season.
</P>
<P>
   We couldn't have asked for a better reminder that fall may be
the shortest season of all.

   MONEY: Andy Jackson's portrait on the 20 shows a younger,
thinner fellow that bears little resemblance to possibly the
sickest, crankiest president in our history. And old Ben Franklin,
why he's younger and thinner, too. We can't wait to see what they

   WOOD: Ft. Leonard Wood's fortunes have risen and fallen with
world events - Vietnam, the end of the Cold War. Now the base has
escaped from the endangered list by receiving training schools for
chemical weapons specialists and military police, two jobs crucial
to the Army's new role. The new units were officially activated on
Friday. The facility's expansion also is touching the surrounding
community. Oscar Avila. 35. Photos, map.

   WITS: Cooperative witnesses are difficult to find in the best of
circumstances, but the recent murders of witness Sophia Szymczak
and would-be snitch James Weber don't make it any easier. The
bottom line, say police and prosecutors, is trust. Potential
witnesses have to believe that authorities will protect them.

   COTTON. In southern Kansas, there is a growing reliance on a new

GEORGE W.: A FALSTAFF IN WAITING OR PRINCE MOST ROYAL? 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALEX A. VARDAMIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner

<P>
   CARMEL, Calif. _ ``O, for a muse of fire that would ascend the
brightest heaven of invention,'' William Shakespeare wrote in
``Henry V.''
</P>
<P>
   We need a muse of fire to penetrate the core of character.
George W. Bush's misspent youth is under scrutiny. Can the nation
survive a president who may have frolicked at pot parties, perhaps
sniffed cocaine and no doubt danced to rock and roll? What kind of
leader would a person like that be?
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare, the bard of Avon, might provide the answer. Prince
Hal comes to mind.
</P>
<P>
   Drinking and wenching in London's Boar's Head Tavern, Prince Hal
squandered his youth.
</P>
<P>
   He consorted with the lecherous, gluttonous, dishonest,
self-indulgent, obese Falstaff. From his dubious role model, the
heir-apparent learned the joys of wine, immediate gratification and
sexual promiscuity.
</P>
<P>
   All to the consternation of his dad. What would become of the
kingdom when Henry IV passed on to his great reward and Happy Hal
assumed the throne? A similar question plagues George I of the
House of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Languishing in Maine, the old man summoned his own wayward boy
upon the royal Kennebunkport carpet. To record their conversation
we need not _ to complete the muse-of-fire quotation _ ``ascend to
the brightest heaven of invention.'' We can rely on a secret tape.
</P>
<P>
   As the recording begins, George I stands on the windswept porch
of the royal residence-in-exile. He turns to former cabinet
courtiers.: Give us leave. The madcap Prince of Texas and I must
have some private conference.
</P>
<P>
   Sound of feet, EXEUNT. Angry surf pounds in the background.
</P>
<P>
   The king is alone with the debauched heir apparent.
</P>
<P>
   King George: Come hither, son, the noble image of my youth, and
let me warn you yet again. We have a noble lineage, but our
aristocratic soil is most subject to weeds. And you seem overspread
with them. Take heed. Fall not into the mold of that new-age Bill
Falstaff who daily brings discredit on the oval throne room.
Cocaine bad.
</P>
<P>
   Prince W.: My dread lord, I can pass the strictest standards of
your past administration and shall hereafter be more a proper Bush.
</P>
<P>
   George: And you'll not slip back into Falstaffian lewdness?
</P>
<P>
   W.: If all the year were playing holidays, to sport with interns
would be as tedious as work. Fear not. I led a wild youth, 'tis
true. But 'twas a quarter of a century past. Some of my misdeeds
were exaggerated. Find pardon in my true submission.
</P>
<P>
   George: I pardon you, but will the media?
</P>
<P>
   W.: I'll place a stake in the ground and say no more. My new
self will show up much better, in contrast to my unbridled youth.
Like bright metal on a sullen ground, my reformation will glitter
over my fault, and shall show more goodly and attract more votes
than a candidate who hath no foil to set him off.
</P>
<P>
   George: Such as?
</P>
<P>
   W.: My deadly adversary, Al Hotspur, the dull duke of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   George: Good, my noble son. But beware. Hot Gore's companion,
the lord of misrule, Bill Falstaff, and his seedy lot will
backbite. In 1994 my allies removed their stings and teeth. But the
serpents have grown new fangs. Keep close watch on them.
</P>
<P>
   W.: Father, I shall crush them in a landslide. Al Hotspur will
not usurp my glory. Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere.
And when I enter into my inheritance I shall cast out Falstaff,
Gore and all their vile companions. HASTA LA VISTA, MUCHACHOS.
</P>
<P>
   George: O my son, your words are balm to my ears. Now hark!
Control your headstrong riot, your hot Bush blood. And drop the
whine.
</P>
<P>
   W.: I'll try, my lord. Like father, like son.
</P>
<P>
   George: And yet a word. In time of domestic trouble, be it thy
course to busy giddy minds with foreign quarrels. War obliterates
the memory of a bad economy or arrant deeds. Recall the aspirin
factory in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   W.: And the line in the Arabian sands, my royal father.
</P>
<P>
   George: Ah, yes. In the winds of desert storm, how my approval
ratings soared.
</P>
<P>
   W.: True, you won the war, my gracious liege. Then lost the
election, but passed the torch to me.
</P>
<P>
   George: (Loud sigh.) How did he ever beat me? To be so pestered
with a popinjay.
</P>
<P>
   W.: The people flock to arrant knaves. And yet, 'tis noble kings
they make their role models.
</P>
<P>
   George: Revenge me, my younger self. Gore the Duke of Gore, and
thus thou mightest win the more thy father's love.
</P>
<P>
   W.: I shall. And those contributors who shirk from helping me
shall think themselves accursed, and hold their manhoods cheap
while any speak who supported me on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   The tape ends.
</P>
<P>
   The only sound is of the waves crashing against the House of
Bush. Perhaps the heir apparent kneels to receive his royal
father's blessing as he goes forth to do battle.
</P>
<P>
   Who shall emerge victorious? What the legacy of old Bill
Falstaff? Will that lovable scoundrel sully the shining armor of Al
of the Gore of Tennessee? Will W. of the Bushes slide back into his
dissolute ways? Hal, of old, assumed the glorious mantle of the
warlike Harry.
</P>
<P>
   Will young Prince George, too, being tested, prove himself most
royal?
</P>

<P>
   THE BEST OF THE MILLENNIUM MAGAZINES
</P>
<P>
   Dear Editor,
</P>
<P>
   The Millennium Series, six special issues of The New York Times
Magazine, April 18 through December 5, 1999, celebrates the last
1,000 years of mankind in six themed issues, each on a different,
compelling topic, with contributions by a stellar lineup of
writers.
</P>
<P>
   We have put together a collection of 14 outstanding articles
from the first four issues. Please contact me if you would like
more details on this special package.
</P>
<P>
   Best regards, Karl Horwitz October 1, 1999
</P>
<P>
   April 18: ``The Best of the Millennium''
</P>
<P>
   1. Every Dictator's Nightmare by Wole Soyinka Pulitzer
Prize-winning playwright and Nigerian pro-democracy leader Wole
Soyinka writes, ``every dictator's nightmare'' is the idea that
humans have rights. No matter who preaches it, the universal
principle of the fundamental rights of man is a tyrant's ``province
of terror.'' This concept is poised to totally liberate the lives
of billions of people in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   2. Invention is the Mother of Necessity by Jared Diamond
Pulitzer Prize-winning author and physicist Jared Diamond tells why
he believes that Gutemberg does not deserve sole credit for
inventing the printing press - although it is, no doubt, one of the
greatest inventions in history.
</P>
<P>
   3. When Tristam Met Isolde by Joyce Carol Oates In the ancient
world, romantic love was apparently virtually unknown and rarely
celebrated. Our term ``love'' did not exist and ``eros'' referred
to chaos, even disaster. But to the modern sensibility, love is the
very engine of life and romantic love will survive - at least by
another millennium.
</P>
<P>
   4. How the Bean Saved Civilization by Umberto Eco Forget
electricity, the microchip and the car. Without beans we wouldn't
have made it out of the Dark Ages. If human beings are still here -
Americans and children of European ancestors, descendants of the
Pilgrim Fathers or the Spanish conquistadores - it is thanks to
beans.
</P>
<P>
   May 16 : ``Women : Shadow History of the Millennium''
</P>
<P>
   5. Power Suffering by Jennifer Egan The lives of the mystic
saints offer a cruel lesson in success -- that for many women,
power and suffering, often self-inflicted, are curiously
intertwined.
</P>
<P>
   6. Women in Fiction : First Person Female by Jim Harrison The
author of ``The Road Home'' and ``The Shape of the Journey''
confesses that it isn't easy to be a man writing female characters.
</P>
<P>
   7. Baby in a Box by Natalie Angier Every day, technology offers
women more choices for how and where to bear children - and a
tormenting array of new moral dilemmas.
</P>
<P>
   June 17 : ``The Great Adventures''
</P>
<P>
   8. In the Same Boat by Richard Ford Being in a boat with Stanley
Crouch trying to rediscover Mark Twain's legend, and some personal
truths about modern race relations, became a confessional inward
journey for Richard Ford. An experience in which he was to confront
his own guilt -- and the limits of thinking in black and white.
</P>
<P>
   9. Found in the Woods by Charles Siebert You can still visit a
patch of the forest primeval, in the very urban area of the Bronx,
N.Y. Just don't take a cell phone and watch out for skunks. Charles
Siebert pitches a tent, not far from the zoo, fully equipped with
smoked turkey and Swiss cheese sandwiches, sour pickles, two
bottles of V-8 juice and a pair of binoculars to see any passing
coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   10. On the Road with God's Fool by Gretel Ehrlich The author
retraces the journey St. Francis is believed to have taken in the
13th century, after he stood naked in Assisi's central plaza, lost
his family and possessions and redefined his life as a saint.
</P>
<P>
   11. Journey to the Centre of My Mind by Stephen S. Hall Here is
a different sort of personal journey. This author's adventure takes
place in a medical laboratory on Manhattan's Upper East Side, where
he undergoes an MRI - magnetic resonance imaging - test. The
purpose? To see, in his own brain, the home of memory, the land of
language and the areas that may eventually help to map
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   12. Why We Go by Andrea Barrett Even a modest adventure can
reinvent the world -- and our place in it. Here the author explains
the human impulse to go on adventures -- to ski and climb and sail
and mountain climb and explore the wilds.
</P>
<P>
   September 19 : ``Scenes from the Millennium''
</P>
<P>
   13. The Triumph of Imagery by Luc Sante For most of the
millennium, art was reserved for the rich and the religious. Now,
wherever we look, there is something to see. But is there no
escape?
</P>
<P>
   14. The Crusades, Even Now by Karen Armstrong Europe's first
mass movement has churned Western life ever since.

A TRIBUTE TO MAX OPHULS ON THE SILVER SCREEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last woman for whom Max Ophuls went behind the camera was
``Lola Montes.'' It was 1955, two years before his death, and she
was his most wretched subject _ washed up, desperate, attempting
everything in her feckless power to matter again, both as a dancer
and a courtesan.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed to be reaching for a masterpiece as if that
achievement had eluded him throughout the 24 previous films he had
made, as though at 53 he could see a bit of himself in her scandal
and tragedy. But ``Lola'' feels like the phantasmagoric final act
in an artist's career that demanded that cinema meet the stage, in
the same way that for ambitious dreamers heaven can sometimes touch
the earth.
</P>
<P>
   For Ophuls, there was never a sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   For one week, the Castro theater in San Francisco will run 12 of
his films in a program assembled and mounted by the San Francisco
Film Society, which hunted the globe to find spotless prints of
Ophuls' works that provided more than a comprehensive sampler of
his oeuvre.
</P>
<P>
   Taken in full or even in parts, the retrospective leaves you not
only with the knowledge that the director died while working at the
height of his ambition but that he was such a consummate sensualist
storyteller that his rapture crept under the skin of everyone's
work from Hitchcock to Nora Ephron.
</P>
<P>
   The series has wisely been arranged out of sequence in
double-feature pairs _ beginning with a masterpiece, ``The Earrings
of Madame De ...,'' Ophuls' penultimate film, and ending with
``Caught'' from 1949 _ demonstrating what an uncommonly focused
filmmaker he was.
</P>
<P>
   The subject matter never strayed far from dilapidated love among
the bourgeoisie. Though his films were made in his native Germany,
in France and in Hollywood, and there's an unwavering assurance in
each.
</P>
<P>
   He came to America and made ``The Exile'' in 1947, an
embarrassing costume-y star vehicle that Douglas Fairbanks Jr.
wrote and produced for himself. It begins to explain why of the
four and half American films he made _ one of three uncredited
directors on 1950's ``Vendetta'' _ for Hollywood, only two hang
nicely in his gallery: ``Reckless Moment'' and ``Letter From an
Unknown Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   The former was an uncharacteristically generic piece of noir
pulp, notable for its lightning pacing, its spareness and a silky,
shady James Mason. It demonstrates that if Ophuls wanted to
maintain a career as a magnificent hack, he would've had a
brilliant time communing with Sam Fuller and fellow German Robert
Siodmak.
</P>
<P>
   But it was 1948's ``Unknown Woman'' that would be his finest
hour in Hollywood. It's a 90-minute love story with the opulence of
a saga. Joan Fontaine plays Lisa, the eponymous scribe who sends to
the love of her life, a pianist (Louis Jourdan), a letter so lyric
it seems more conjured than written, particularly the way Fontaine
exhales its contents in the voice-over.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the film's beauty lies the type of love that obsessed
Ophuls: the unsuccessful kind. Love wasn't simply complicated, it
was supernaturally awful. As a teen-ager, Lisa is seduced by
Jordan's player then discarded pregnant with his son. He meets her
years later as a grown woman, thinking she's a fresh conquest,
never realizing his romantic faux pas.
</P>
<P>
   The suffering is too much to bear, but the strings of fate
pulling at the film's lovers are the cosmic forces compelling the
sexual pairings in ``La Ronde,'' another master work in which
Ophuls balances reserve with excess. Ophuls' love was festooned
with costumes and wall-to-wall music. He could finds sumptuousness
even in the most decadent of situations (see his suggestive
handling of Guy de Maupassant's short stories in ``Le Plaisir''; or
simply the Spartan presence of Charles Boyer in ``Madame de.''
</P>
<P>
   Ophuls believed above all in rhapsody before he believed in
love, not as an adornment, but as a lifestyle choice, wrapped in a
stole, pulling up to the opera in a horse-drawn carriage, leaving
the box seats to weep. But as someone in ``Madame de'' says, ``it's
only superficially superficial.''

A TRIBUTE TO MAX OPHULS ON THE SILVER SCREEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last woman for whom Max Ophuls went behind the camera was
``Lola Montes.'' It was 1955, two years before his death, and she
was his most wretched subject _ washed up, desperate, attempting
everything in her feckless power to matter again, both as a dancer
and a courtesan.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed to be reaching for a masterpiece as if that
achievement had eluded him throughout the 24 previous films he had
made, as though at 53 he could see a bit of himself in her scandal
and tragedy. But ``Lola'' feels like the phantasmagoric final act
in an artist's career that demanded that cinema meet the stage, in
the same way that for ambitious dreamers heaven can sometimes touch
the earth.
</P>
<P>
   For Ophuls, there was never a sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   For one week, the Castro theater in San Francisco will run 12 of
his films in a program assembled and mounted by the San Francisco
Film Society, which hunted the globe to find spotless prints of
Ophuls' works that provided more than a comprehensive sampler of
his oeuvre.
</P>
<P>
   Taken in full or even in parts, the retrospective leaves you not
only with the knowledge that the director died while working at the
height of his ambition but that he was such a consummate sensualist
storyteller that his rapture crept under the skin of everyone's
work from Hitchcock to Nora Ephron.
</P>
<P>
   The series has wisely been arranged out of sequence in
double-feature pairs _ beginning with a masterpiece, ``The Earrings
of Madame De ...,'' Ophuls' penultimate film, and ending with
``Caught'' from 1949 _ demonstrating what an uncommonly focused
filmmaker he was.
</P>
<P>
   The subject matter never strayed far from dilapidated love among
the bourgeoisie. Though his films were made in his native Germany,
in France and in Hollywood, and there's an unwavering assurance in
each.
</P>
<P>
   He came to America and made ``The Exile'' in 1947, an
embarrassing costume-y star vehicle that Douglas Fairbanks Jr.
wrote and produced for himself. It begins to explain why of the
four and half American films he made _ one of three uncredited
directors on 1950's ``Vendetta'' _ for Hollywood, only two hang
nicely in his gallery: ``Reckless Moment'' and ``Letter From an
Unknown Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   The former was an uncharacteristically generic piece of noir
pulp, notable for its lightning pacing, its spareness and a silky,
shady James Mason. It demonstrates that if Ophuls wanted to
maintain a career as a magnificent hack, he would've had a
brilliant time communing with Sam Fuller and fellow German Robert
Siodmak.
</P>
<P>
   But it was 1948's ``Unknown Woman'' that would be his finest
hour in Hollywood. It's a 90-minute love story with the opulence of
a saga. Joan Fontaine plays Lisa, the eponymous scribe who sends to
the love of her life, a pianist (Louis Jourdan), a letter so lyric
it seems more conjured than written, particularly the way Fontaine
exhales its contents in the voice-over.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the film's beauty lies the type of love that obsessed
Ophuls: the unsuccessful kind. Love wasn't simply complicated, it
was supernaturally awful. As a teen-ager, Lisa is seduced by
Jordan's player then discarded pregnant with his son. He meets her
years later as a grown woman, thinking she's a fresh conquest,
never realizing his romantic faux pas.
</P>
<P>
   The suffering is too much to bear, but the strings of fate
pulling at the film's lovers are the cosmic forces compelling the
sexual pairings in ``La Ronde,'' another master work in which
Ophuls balances reserve with excess. Ophuls' love was festooned
with costumes and wall-to-wall music. He could finds sumptuousness
even in the most decadent of situations (see his suggestive
handling of Guy de Maupassant's short stories in ``Le Plaisir''; or
simply the Spartan presence of Charles Boyer in ``Madame de.''
</P>
<P>
   Ophuls believed above all in rhapsody before he believed in
love, not as an adornment, but as a lifestyle choice, wrapped in a
stole, pulling up to the opera in a horse-drawn carriage, leaving
the box seats to weep. But as someone in ``Madame de'' says, ``it's
only superficially superficial.''

 &HT;    PEACE, POLLUTION: NEGOTIATORS WORK TO CONTROL DUMPING IN
DISPUTED WEST BANK
 &HT;    475&AMP;ADD

<TEXT>
<P>
   UM IT-TUT, West Bank _ An elder community leader, Naifeh Abdul
Kareem clearly did not know what to do with the 230 oozing barrels
of waste illegally dumped in his farming village.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone wants to make some money, he does not care about
anything,'' Abdul Kareem, 63, said looking at the barrels stacked
among the houses of a shallow valley here. ``He is not worried
about the harm that could happen to people.''
</P>
<P>
   The chemicals _ for mixing paints _ were brought by an Israeli
who, it is believed, paid one of Abdul Kareem's neighbors to accept
them. For eight months, they sat seeping in the hot sun until they
were removed last week.
</P>
<P>
   For 30 years, the West Bank has been used for dumping by both
Palestinians and Israelis taking advantage of the weak legal
controls in the disputed area. Now, with peace talks gaining
momentum, environmental officials are just beginning to bring
modern waste-management practices to the territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have . . . the scientific and technical procedures.
We just have what we call crude dumping,'' said Palestinian
Authority Environmental Minister Yousef Abu-Safieh.
</P>
<P>
   He says the new Israeli government elected in May has been more
sensitive about environmental issues that were being neglected in
previous years. They have reason to be concerned. Both Israelis and
Palestinians draw much of their water from an aquifer beneath the
West Bank, which could be affected by exuding wastes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely there is an issue, a very grave issue,'' said
Shmuel Brenner, a top official in the Israeli environment ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The West Bank and The Gaza Strip were captured by Israel in the
1967 War. The Israeli army has governed the area, including 2.5
million Palestinians and about 180,000 Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1993 Oslo peace accords, Israel has turned over most
of Gaza and about 40 percent of the West Bank to full or partial
Palestinian control. But the environmental problems are just now
being addressed.
</P>
<P>
   There are only a few legal dumps in the West Bank and Gaza and
they are below modern standards. Trash, junked cars, and discarded
barrels can be found along roadsides at hundreds of other sites.
</P>
<P>
   At one of the legal dumps, run by Israel but near the
Palestinian town of Azzun, Palestinian employee Adam Bedwan said
truckers frequently ``beg'' for receipts from him for loads they
have illegally dumped elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and Palestinian officials say they have not assessed the
damage caused by such dumping.
</P>
<P>
   They acknowledge that both sides have contributed.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people in the area are Palestinians and it follows
that they generate most of the waste. But, there are about 145
Jewish settlements in the West Bank and some have factories. Also,
it is easy for Israelis to truck waste to the West Bank, rather
than paying to have it treated in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   That's what officials believe happened here in Um It-Tut, a case
that shows some of the obstacles to cleaning up the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The barrels were brought from a factory in a settlement about a
half-hour's drive away. They should have been taken to a treatment
center about four hours away in southern Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian owner of the land where they were dumped says he
intended to use the chemicals to start his own paint factory.
However, he is a laborer with little money and officials believe it
is more likely he was just paid by the Israeli to accept the waste.
</P>
<P>
   Once found, Israeli and Palestinian officials could not agree on
who should pay to have the 230 barrels moved.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis say they will treat such waste if the Palestinians
transport it. Palestinians counter that doing that will encourage
anyone with waste to dump it in their areas and avoid transport
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Though the barrels have been moved from Um It-Tut, officials
have not settled the financial responsibility and are hoping to
have the costs paid by _ and perhaps prosecute _ the factory owner.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials say the waste problem in the West Bank should
be solved by bringing in private firms to manage landfills for
anyone _ Jews in settlements or Arabs in towns.
</P>
<P>
   Abu-Safieh, the Palestinian Authority minister, recognizes the
logic to that, but that's where politics enters the picture.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the settlements, which were established by Israel to
stake a claim to occupied land, remains to be settled in the Oslo
process. Abu-Safieh says cooperating on landfills with settlers
would be like recognizing the validity of settlements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The settlers are not our neighbors,'' he said. ``They are
occupiers.''
</P>
<P>
   However, with $25 million in foreign aid, the Palestinians are
beginning work on two modern landfills of their own here in the
West Bank. Meanwhile, Palestinian and Israeli environmentalists are
meeting regularly to hash out their differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our destinies are together in this place,'' Abu-Safieh
concedes.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Did Gary Bauer commit adultery with a campaign aide? Rumors to
that effect have circulated for weeks. Monday, a New York Daily
News gossip column asked, ``What presidential candidate is praying
that a former secretary doesn't go public with her claim that he's
been having an affair with a twentysomething woman? Many on the
married Republican's campaign staff are already jumping ship.''
</P>
<P>
   National Journal's Hotline broadcast that teaser, and radio host
Don Imus linked it to Bauer. The San Francisco Chronicle asked
Bauer about the rumors and published his denial Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Wednesday, Bauer denied that he had
violated his marital vows or inappropriately touched anyone, and he
challenged the dozens of reporters on hand to produce evidence or a
specific, on-the-record allegation that he had done so.
</P>
<P>
   If reporters had the evidence, they could have produced it. If
not, they could have closed their notebooks and walked away.
Instead, they interrogated Bauer for half an hour in front of eight
TV cameras and wrote articles suggesting that whether or not he had
had an affair, he was wrong to have left open the possibility that
anyone might have thought he had done anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal isn't that Bauer committed adultery. The scandal is
that without proving that charge or even making it, the media have
found ways to spin lesser, derivative, and empty insinuations about
him into a national story. Let's examine the charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   --Bauer committed ``the appearance of impropriety.'' Unable to
produce allegations of impropriety, reporters asked Bauer in
accusatory tones whether he had ``met behind closed doors'' with
the aide, Melissa McClard (answer: yes), and whether Bauer's aides
had told him ``that people are asking questions [about it] and it's
making people uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bauer challenged a reporter to define the alleged
``inappropriate behavior,'' the reporter replied, ``That you were
seen too often with a woman on your campaign, who is described to
me as being 26 years old and blond.'' Another reporter accused
Bauer of being ``ambiguous, because you're not really telling us
... can you understand the perception that you may have had an
affair?'' How Bauer could refute such perceptions, questions, and
discomfort was equally ambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   Two alleged Bauer accusers, former aides Charles Jarvis and Tim
McDonald, finally went on the record Wednesday. Jarvis said he had
no proof of a sexual relationship between Bauer and McClard, and
McDonald said he believed Bauer's denial of such a relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than conclude that there was no story, the Washington
Post published an article, headlined ``Ex-Aides to Bauer Speak
Out,'' which paraphrased the two men as saying Bauer's meetings
with McClard ``looked'' inappropriate and ``lent themselves to
gossip and rumor.'' The Post quoted Jarvis as saying Bauer ``has no
business creating that kind of appearance of impropriety.''
</P>
<P>
   --The appearance of impropriety by a Christian conservative is
itself improper. A Post reporter pressed Bauer about his
closed-door meetings with McClard: ``Billy Graham doesn't do it,
James Dobson doesn't do it. So [among] the people who you are close
to, actually, there is a sensitivity about meeting with women
behind closed doors. I'm not saying there should be one. I don't
think there should. But there is one.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's Post reported that Jarvis and McDonald ``said Bauer
spent hours behind closed doors with her and traveled alone with
her, violating the strict rules they believe govern conservative
Christian married men in their dealings with women.'' By framing
the issue as ``sensitivity,'' the Post avoided taking
responsibility for deeming Bauer's closed-door meetings an
important issue.
</P>
<P>
   --Bauer appeared to ignore allegations of the appearance of
impropriety. ``Is it possible,'' a reporter asked Bauer, ``that you
may have been engaging in behavior that was perfectly innocent
[but] in the minds of the people who work for you and respected you
was inappropriate, and that perhaps you--as it was put by someone
to me--you appeared a little arrogant in refusing to recognize,
according to them, their complaints?'' In other words, Bauer's
offense is that he dismissed a perception he knew to be false.
</P>
<P>
   --Bauer is covering up allegations of the appearance of
impropriety. Reporters asked Bauer whether aides had told him they
were ``uncomfortable'' about the appearance of his relationship
with McClard. One reporter asked whether Bauer's former secretary
had told him, ``I wish you wouldn't behave this way with this
woman.'' When Bauer challenged the reporter to explain the meaning
of ``behave this way,'' the reporter admitted, ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer denied that his aides had alleged actual impropriety: ``No
one leaving my campaign has said, 'Gary, I am leaving your campaign
because I believe you're having an affair.' `` He also denied that
any perception of impropriety could be justified: ``I cannot
imagine that anybody in a campaign would object to me having a
meeting behind closed doors with a professional woman.''
</P>
<P>
   The Post, seizing on the latter remark, reported that Jarvis
``sharply disputed Bauer.'' The sad truth, Jarvis told the Post,
was that ``people have confronted Gary about the appearance of
impropriety.'' Similarly, USA Today quoted Jarvis as saying, ``Gary
Bauer just went on national television and refused to tell the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   And what was that truth? That Jarvis and others had quit the
campaign because of their ``concerns about the
relationship''--whatever that means.
</P>
<P>
   --Bauer improperly failed to confront the person who apparently
alleged the appearance of impropriety. ``One would think,'' one
reporter lectured Bauer, ``when you found that the source appeared
to be [the Forbes] campaign, that you would go directly to the head
of that campaign and say, 'Is this happening? Are you people doing
this?'''
</P>
<P>
   Another reporter chimed in, ``For folks who are not presidential
candidates, if somebody was spreading rumors like that about them,
I think the first instinct would be to go to the suspected source
and say, 'Are you doing this? And if so, please stop it.' Why
didn't you do that?''
</P>
<P>
   --Bauer failed to disprove the possibility of impropriety.
Unable to formulate a precise allegation, one reporter asked Bauer
whether his behavior with McClard had been ``flirtatious or in any
way different from how you interact with other aides'' (answer:
no). When Bauer challenged another questioner to explain what he
meant by ``inappropriate behavior,'' the questioner replied, ``How
specific do you want to get? I'm not sure I understand what you
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Bauer's assertion that he had never violated his
wedding vows, another reporter cracked, ``President Clinton said
that too.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's Chicago Tribune reported that Bauer ``would not go
much further than indicating he was faithful to his wife.'' The
collective implication is that Bauer's denials must have been
couched to protect some unspecified kind of dalliance.
</P>
<P>
   --Every allegation is a political fact. Horse-race journalism
ignores whether charges are true and focuses instead on whether
they're damaging. The first question to Bauer Wednesday was,
``Don't you just give this story more momentum by doing this?''
Another reporter asked, ``How do you think your supporters are
going to respond to all this?''
</P>
<P>
   The Post, too scrupulous to say whether Bauer had done anything
wrong or even whether the perception that he might have done so
would hurt him politically, found one political scientist who
``warned that Bauer could be fatally wounded, in political terms,
by the dispute'' and another who ``said Bauer could help himself by
saying, 'I wish I wouldn't have put myself in this kind of
situation, I'm sorry and I apologize.' `` Whether the ``situation''
was a misdeed or a perception was left unexplained.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times told readers that ``the real news was the
wall-to-wall press throng'' at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   --Bauer showed bad judgment by letting the allegations of an
appearance of impropriety become a political problem. A Salon
reporter told Bauer, ``A lot of us have heard this rumor. But to be
quite honest, I think most people in this room are never going to
mention it and probably didn't take it very seriously. But you've
now elevated it to a point that it will be on the evening news. And
a lot of Americans, when they are first introduced to you ... it
will be for that--for denying an affair. What does that say about
your political judgment?''
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, Salon published the reporter's derisive story
about the press conference, titled ``Bauer: I am not a slut!''
</P>
<P>
   The problem isn't that the media are malicious or are out to get
Bauer. I know and like at least two of the reporters who asked some
of the most loaded questions at the press conference.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that they can't resist a hot story. A sex scandal
on the religious right, no matter how flimsy, seems too good to
pass up. Reporters think they have to ask the killer question or
advance the story, never mind which way it's going. The campaign is
in overdrive, their prey stands before them, and the heat of the
moment carries them away.
</P>
<P>
   They wonder whether Gary Bauer is strong enough to resist the
urge. They should ask the same question of themselves.

BUYING WINE ON THE INTERNET CAN MAKE YOU A FELON

   As Internet companies spin into the financial stratosphere, Wall
Street and the business press speak with awe of the revolutionary
implications of the Web. Issue after issue of Forbes, Fortune, and
Business Week detail in awe-struck tones the hundreds of millions
(sometimes even billions) raised by Net companies.
</P>
<P>
   A new staple is the interview with the Internet expert (call him
the I-guru). The editors will ask meekly, ``Dr. Chopra, what
industries do you think will be affected by the Internet?'' To
which the I-guru sighs, pauses, and explains, ``The real question,
Charlie, is what industries will not be affected. Frankly, I can't
think of a single one.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, I can--wine. The booze business might well end up being
one of the few areas of American life undisturbed by the great
Internet revolution. The buying and selling of wine across state
borders is still illegal in 28 states, including New York, where I
live.
</P>
<P>
   It's a pity, because the wine business is perfectly suited to
e-commerce. No store could possibly stock even 10 percent of the
10,000-odd wines produced by America's 1,800 wineries, not to
mention the vineyards of France, Italy and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a godsend if wine buyers could do a Web search for
bottles of, say, Cloudy Bay Sauvignon Blanc, a hard-to-find $16
world-class white wine from New Zealand. In my mind's eye, I see
myself using a search engine similar to the Advanced Book Exchange,
which allows readers to track down secondhand books at hundreds of
shops across North America. I can just see myself clicking the
mouse to comparison shop and then score a bottle from a San
Francisco store, four from a Texas shop, and 12 from a New York
outlet.
</P>
<P>
   I'd settle for being able to buy wine from mainstream Internet
merchants such as 1-800-WINE-SHOP or Wine.com (which used to be
Virtual Vineyards). Alas, only 12 states--most of them in the
West--have completely legalized such acts of capitalism between
consenting adults.
</P>
<P>
   The laws regulating direct wine sales were rarely enforced until
recently, but a new zeal is in the air. Buying a single bottle of
wine from out-of-state is a third-degree felony in Kentucky,
Georgia, and Florida and is punishable with fines of up to $2,000
and jail time.
</P>
<P>
   And Orrin Hatch, senior senator from the parched state of Utah,
has introduced a bill that would allow federal courts to prosecute
offenders. Indeed, Hatch was moved to federalize this crime
precisely because new technologies like the Internet make it easier
to buy wine nationally (horrors!). Rep. Joe Scarborough, R-Fla.,
introduced a similar bill in the House--which passed by a hefty
margin.
</P>
<P>
   At the risk of making a one-way trip up the river (''I must take
the Fifth about my wine purchases, senator''), I spent a couple of
weeks this summer surfing the Web for vino. Some wine stores keep
their lists online, but none of New York City's big
operations--Sherry Lehamn, Zachy's, and Morrell's--do. Many of the
Web wine lists I browsed were so outdated that 20 percent of the
wine I wanted to order was out of stock.
</P>
<P>
   One major California wine merchant I spoke to said that the
Internet isn't having much effect on his business because people
from most big states can't use it to order wines. If Internet wine
buying was uniformly decriminalized and there was a genuine
nationwide market, on the other hand, the system would be more
creative and efficient.
</P>
<P>
   I had better luck ordering from two shops outside New York, the
Corkscrew (http://www.thecorkscrew.com/) in Springfield, Ill., and
K&AMP;L Wine Merchants (http://www.klwines.com/) (a widely known and
well-regarded place) of San Francisco, as well as Wine.com, an
online-only store in Napa. The sites are pretty well run but,
again, they simply don't compare with those selling books, CDs,
clothes, and baby wares.
</P>
<P>
   The wines were shipped to a friend in Washington state, one of
the enlightened places where e-wines are legal. Precisely how I
obtained the wines is a matter of ``don't ask, don't tell.''
</P>
<P>
   I deliberately chose wines that could travel badly--delicate
white Bordeaux, Champagne, Pinot Grigio--and also some
harder-to-find wines such as Californian Italian wines
(Sangioveses). The wines were received in Seattle within a week of
ordering. They were all very well packed in special thermacol wine
molds. As a result, almost miraculously, most of the wines held up
even though they were shipped in 90 degree weather.
</P>
<P>
   The Champagne (Billecart-Salmon's special K&AMP;L bottling, $26.99)
went slightly off (losing fruit and gaining acidity); the cheaper
white Bordeaux, Pont de Brion Blanc ($13.99), was a decent steely
Sauvignon Blanc that stood up to the trip nicely. The more
expensive Chateau Smith-Haut-Lafite ($22.95) was superb, delicate,
flowery, and yet crisp. But in an hour or two it began fading;
signs of jet lag.

   The Sangioveses were the most pleasant surprise--Shaffer ($15)
and a Virtual Vineyards special bottling ($13): Both were
delicious, with the pointed flavors of Italian Chianti and the
ripeness of California's clime mixed together. American
Chianti-style wines are going to be the next trend in Californian
winemaking.
</P>
<P>
   Back to the puritans. Why do the new prohibitionists oppose
Internet wine? They claim two concerns: First, like most new
legislation in America, it has been passed for the benefit of the
children. ``States need to ensure that minors are not provided with
unfettered access to alcohol,'' Hatch explained. He trots out the
usual anecdote masquerading as evidence--a 13-year-old boy once
ordered beer off the Internet. In fact, there is little danger that
teen-agers are going to order unusual wines from distant wineries,
wait days for them to arrive, arrange to have their parents out of
the house when they do, and then ... what? Throw a Claret keg
party? California's State Bureau of Alcohol has received exactly
one complaint of an Internet sale to a minor in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Second, it's for the Constitution. The 21st Amendment, which
repealed prohibition, allows states to regulate the transportation
of ``intoxicating liquors.'' Indeed, Hatch's bill is titled ``The
21st Amendment Enforcement Act.''
</P>
<P>
   But the protections of the 21st Amendment are actually quite
thin. The language of most state laws would seem to violate the
Constitution's interstate commerce clause, which facilitated the
creation of a national economy. Judges are increasingly coming to
this view. At the very least, it means that the restrictions do not
have the halo of constitutional protection.
</P>
<P>
   The 21st Amendment's intent was to give the states the power to
prosecute the Mafia's involvement in the liquor trade. But because
much of the Mafia's interest in booze died with the repeal of
prohibition, what keeps these laws alive is politics.
</P>
<P>
   Liquor regulation is a case study in the manipulation of
politics by powerful lobbies. The regulations in force are
maintained and strengthened because distributors, wholesalers, and
large wineries benefit from them, and they are organized and
politically powerful. Over the years, their lobbies have been
effective at working with local cranks to regulate the minutiae of
the wine business. In 15 states in America, grocery stores can't
sell wine. In Colorado, half-bottles of wine are illegal, but in
Florida oversized bottles are illegal. And so on. (The single most
bizarre law, which banned giving wine to dogs in Chicago, has
recently been repealed.)
</P>
<P>
   Those who lose out are small and up-and-coming wineries,
specialty producers and, of course, consumers who would have more
choice and lower prices. The entire setup has an anti-competitive,
anti-entrepreneurial flavor that rewards political lobbying rather
than good business practices.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch seems to recognize this when he says, ``If there is a
problem with the system we need to fix the system, not break the
laws.'' For the moment, however, the fix is in for the consumer.

   1. WHEN THE REAL SCANDAL IS THE MEDIA SPIN, by William Saletan
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Wednesday, Gary Bauer denied that he had
violated his marital vows or inappropriately touched anyone, and he
challenged the dozens of reporters on hand to produce evidence or a
specific allegation that he had done so. If reporters had the
evidence, they could have produced it. If not, they could have
closed their notebooks and walked away. Instead, they interrogated
Bauer for half an hour in front of eight TV cameras and wrote
articles suggesting that whether or not he had had an affair, he
was wrong to have left open the possibility that anyone might have
thought he had done anything wrong. The scandal isn't that Bauer
committed adultery. The scandal is that without proving that charge
or even making it, the media have found ways to spin lesser,
derivative, and empty insinuations about him into a national story.

</P>
<P>
   The booze business might well end up being one of the few areas
of American life undisturbed by the great Internet revolution. The
buying and selling of wine across state borders is still illegal in
28 states It's a pity, because the wine business is perfectly
suited to e-commerce. No store could possibly stock even 10 percent
of the 10,000-odd wines produced by America's 1,800 wineries, not
to mention the vineyards of France, Italy and Australia.

<P>
   The president and vice president of the United States are being
accused of having ``lost'' Russia _ the assumption being that
Russia was there to be ``lost'' by the West in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russia is being portrayed in the media as perhaps the
most corrupt place in the world. The implicit message is: ``Don't
touch Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago I asked former Secretary of State George Shultz what
he thought had gone wrong in the U.S.-Russian relationship. ``We
should have found a way to show that we respect your country,'' he
replied, ``that we are ready to treat it as a real partner despite
its problems.'' Next to all the current confusion, that sounds good
to me.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, the ``point man'' on
Russia in the Clinton White House, despite his expertise, has been
rather defensive and not very helpful: ``We have been aware from
the beginning that crime and corruption are a huge problem in
Russia and a huge obstacle to reform. Russian reform is not over,
but it's going to take decades and the problem will only get worse
if you isolate Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, for his part, has insisted
that all the negative headlines regarding Moscow going down the
drain are rooted in U.S. electoral politics and aim at
``besmirching Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   But these reactions badly miss the point. There never was a
debate in the West about how to ``engage'' Moscow, and it truly
doesn't sound as if one is about to start now.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at the so-called money-laundering, IMF-loan scandal.
It certainly shows no sign of abating. This is purported to involve
money from Russia, perhaps IMF loans, high-ranking Russian
officials and the Bank of New York. The story so far is complex and
convoluted and has fact, fantasy and flawed reasoning mixed in
unknown proportion.
</P>
<P>
   As to facts, it seems clear that large amounts of money, of
murky and possibly criminal origin, went through accounts in the
Bank of New York without triggering any reporting or regulatory
alarms or procedures. How this could happen in banking _ which is
arguably the most regulated area in the U.S. economy _ is anyone's
guess.
</P>
<P>
   One might expect that this would be the first question for the
media and congressional watchdogs to ask.
</P>
<P>
   Not a chance.
</P>
<P>
   In a highly charged political atmosphere, the debate has taken a
different turn. ``Hands off Russia!'' ``Russia was never any
good!'' ``No wonder Russia lost the Cold War!'' _ this gloating is
a mere diversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue that troubles me,'' says Condoleezza Rice, a top
adviser to likely Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush,
``is: Were we accepting the rhetoric of reform rather than real
reform in Russia?''
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the right questions to ask. Rice is also right to
use the word ``we,'' because the same mistake was made by President
Bush and President Clinton, by Republicans and Democrats alike.
</P>
<P>
   Once the fundamental assumption was made that Russia was a
nation defeated in the Cold War, once the rhetoric of U.S. ``aid''
for Russia replaced the idea of cooperation, subsequent
developments flowed almost automatically.
</P>
<P>
   Troops of American university presidents with little or no
knowledge of the realities of Russia's economy arrived in Moscow to
``advise on economic reform,'' with no regard for the cultural
obstacles they were facing or the need to create a legal framework
for economic change. Sending fly-by-night academics to ``give
advice'' and then looking the other way as ``the new Russia''
degenerated into an orgy of oligarchy and corruption was not the
best way to show respect and willingness for partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, in a recent article in The Washington Post, U.S.
national security adviser Samuel Berger asserts that that was the
only way to go.
</P>
<P>
   Well then, one has to live with the consequences. Mafia-style
economics and a merging of organized crime and bureaucracy become a
very real result when know-nothing advisers put fancy plans into
action that destroy a government's economic control _ and nothing
is put in place instead.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not President Yeltsin and members of his family were
involved in any improprieties is almost irrelevant. What matters is
that Yeltsin is presiding over a system that has made a mockery of
democracy, market economics and the rule of law _ achieving those
goals was among Russia's priorities since the Cold War ended.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, still, the possibilities for cooperative U.S.-Russian
programs are virtually limitless. They exist today, as they have
for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   As two former senators, Gary Hart and Gordon Humphrey, wrote
recently in a letter to The New York Times, ``Why not a U.S.-led
program to create a sound banking system, a mortgage-lending
program, long-term oil purchase contracts to provide revenues for
infrastructure rebuilding and jobs, and a program to establish a
desperately needed pharmaceutical industry?''
</P>
<P>
   It will probably take elections in both countries to cool down
the rhetoric and assess what has been happening and where to go
from here.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, it would not be a bad idea to quit lamenting
the death of Russia and instead take a long, hard look at the
global economy and what has happened to the barriers that once were
in place to prevent the free flow of capital.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps someone might even stand up (when all the noise pipes
down about ``dreadful Russia'') and ask this: Has it not become too
easy for the barons of dirty money to make and hide their mountains
of gold?

 By ERIK ECKHOLM  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    In 1992, a retired book editor named Zhu Zheng read a short
essay a friend of his had written about the Anti-Rightist Campaign
of 1957. That year, more than half a million people were purged
after they responded to Mao Zedong's invitation to criticize the
revolution, only to find themselves branded enemies.
 &HT;    For Zhu, the topic had special resonance. As an idealistic young
journalist in the southern city of Changsha in 1957, he was labeled
``a poisonous weed'' and spent several years breaking rocks in a
labor camp. Upon reading his friend's words, Zhu recalls, he was
consumed by the need to tell the story in detail.
 &HT;    Like many who lived through it, Zhu, now 68, sees the 1957
campaign as a terrible turning point, inaugurating a series of
disastrous upheavals that ended only with Mao's death, in 1976.
 &HT;    So in 1993, in one frantic year, Zhu _ who skipped college out
of revolutionary zeal and describes himself as ``a minor
intellectual'' _ scoured the records and newspapers of the period,
interviewed everyone who would talk and scrawled out a book
manuscript, ``The Summer of 1957.''
 &HT;    Then began the quest to get his book printed. Eventually, the
Henan People's Press expressed interest. But in keeping with the
rules for accounts of Communist Party history, the publisher first
sent the manuscript to the chief guardians of the printed word at
the News and Publishing Office, under the central Department of
Propaganda, in Beijing.
 &HT;    The response came in an April 1996 memo, written by three
scholars at the party's History Research Office, to which the
manuscript had been referred. ``Generally, this book is rich in
sources and supports its account with evidence,'' their memo said,
adding, with patronizing politeness, that ``the author's attitude
is serious and rigorous.''
 &HT;    But noting that it covered ``a rather complex'' subject, the
memo _ its daggers cloaked in typically banal Communist prose _
went on to say that ``particular care must be given to adopt an
analytic attitude of seeking truth from facts.'' Specifically, it
said that the manuscript ``still needs to accurately reflect the
spirit of the 1981 resolution on history that the Anti-Rightist
struggle was a necessary one.'' This was a reference to a key
document that for nearly two decades has set the boundaries for
scholarship on the Mao era.
 &HT;    The censors' memo to Zhu demanded excision of quotes from Mao
that had been circulated at the time but later omitted from his
published works as embarrassing. It noted sections where ``the
reasoning and analysis are not proper.'' It barred the naming of so
many persecutors, ``especially influential and well-known
figures,'' and exhorted Zhu to adopt the spirit of ``uniting as one
to look to the future.''
 &HT;    On Oct. 1, China will mark 50 years since Mao proclaimed the
People's Republic before cheering throngs in Tiananmen Square. In
the best Communist fashion, betraying a mix of pride and
insecurity, China is going all out, giving Beijing a virtual
makeover in preparation.
 &HT;    The big day will feature a minutely orchestrated parade of
140,000 _ everything from Young Pioneers in red bandannas to
China's latest ballistic missiles. The marchers will pass under the
giant painting of Mao that perennially hangs over Tiananmen, facing
toward the mausoleum where the Great Helmsman's embalmed body is
displayed.
 &HT;    The group of men who now rule China will celebrate the triumphs
of the Communist revolution and the inevitable glories ahead. But
they are sure to skate over the past. For an unflinching look at
the half-century of Communist Party rule is the last thing the
leaders want. Confession may be good for the soul, but making a
clean breast of prior calamities can be dangerous for a dictatorial
government.
 &HT;    China's current leaders, including President Jiang Zemin,
watched in horror as the Soviet Communist Party collapsed _ and
they are convinced that Mikhail Gorbachev's decision in 1987 to
allow candid probing of Soviet history helped speed its downfall.
And their harsh crackdown on Falun Gong, the spiritual movement
that staged an illegal protest earlier this year, is further
testimony to their insecurity.
 &HT;    China's problem is epitomized by that giant portrait hovering
over the square in the center of Beijing. Mao is the undisputed
founding father of the revolution and remains a key source of the
party's claims to legitimacy. Yet he was also the source of bizarre
and sometimes murderous campaigns that crippled China's
development.
 &HT;    In addition to the Anti-Rightist Campaign, these included the
economically idiotic Great Leap Forward, in the late 1950s, which
caused the famine deaths of tens of millions, and the Cultural
Revolution, a reign of terror stretching from 1966 to Mao's death,
in 1976.
 &HT;    Deng Xiaoping, who created today's more open and vibrant China,
was the first leader to wrestle with the Mao problem. As he gained
power in the years after Mao's death, Deng was intent on preserving
stability while reviving the economy through market reforms.
 &HT;    But even as he pointed China on the capitalist road, he knew he
could not afford to repudiate a Communist legacy that was, after
all, his own foundation for power. Least of all could he take down
that big portrait in Tiananmen Square. So he presided over an
artful revision of official history.
 &HT;    ``It is better to write in broad outline and not go into too
much detail,'' Deng said in a 1981 speech, as the new guidelines
were being prepared. ``The purpose of summing up the past is to
encourage people to close ranks and look to the future.'' Deng had
a personal reason for stifling the truth as well: He had been a
chief enforcer of the Anti-Rightist Campaign.
 &HT;    To an astonishing degree, Chinese historical scholarship,
journalism and public speech must still adhere to that 1981
document, the ``Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of
Our Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China.''
 &HT;    Since he could not afford to jettison the Communist legacy, he
set out to explain the most glaringly disastrous events as
aberrations. The resulting 1981 document is almost surreal in its
efforts to parcel out blame without tarnishing Mao too badly, or
Deng himself.
 &HT;    Mao, it says, was a gross violator of his own thought. The
Cultural Revolution is unambiguously described as wrong, led by Mao
under the mistaken notion that ``capitalist roaders'' had taken
over the party and that ``continuous revolution'' was needed. But
these ``erroneous theses,'' the document says, ``were obviously
inconsistent with the system of Mao Zedong Thought.''
 &HT;    The resolution says that the purges of 1957 were definitely
needed, arguing that some ``rightists'' were out to destroy
socialism, but acknowledges that the purges got out of hand,
harming many innocent people. The Great Leap Forward, with its
forced communal farming and backyard iron smelters, ``overlooked
objective economic laws'' because Mao was ``impatient for quick
results.''
 &HT;    In its overall assessment of Mao, the document describes him as
``a great Marxist and a great proletarian revolutionary, strategist
and theorist.'' In a conclusion that is still parroted by Chinese
officials, it declares, ``If we judge his activities as a whole,
his contributions to the Chinese revolution far outweigh his
mistakes.''
 &HT;    Deng's guidelines have never been updated _ the issues are just
too hot to reopen. So for more recent events, such as the killing
of hundreds in 1989 as the army crushed the student democracy
movement, the government has simply used censorship and arrests.
Everyone instinctively knows the limits.
 &HT;    Today, trying to control history would seem futile. Yes, China's
newspapers and radio and television, virtually without exception,
still stick blandly to the official line. But many Chinese lived
through the disasters and know that the past has been airbrushed.
And now, with the Internet and with so many Chinese studying
abroad, many scholars are also familiar with the devastating
accounts published in the West.
 &HT;    What's more, profit-seeking Chinese publishers are responding to
a clear public yearning with a stream of memoirs, often by retired
party officials, that are loaded with damning facts. These often
wriggle past the censors by avoiding generalizations about national
policy and being careful not to assign blame to particular leaders.
 &HT;    Except in obviously touchy cases, such as Zhu's manuscript on
the 1957 campaign, publishers themselves decide whether a work
needs prior party review. Mostly, writers and editors do their own
tinkering, then publish and pray for enough buzz to stimulate sales
but not attract trouble.
 &HT;    So why do the party leaders still bother? The truth is, that at
this ripe stage in the life cycle of Communist rule, no one really
expects people to believe the canned history or the related, often
vacuous language of political speech.
 &HT;    ``The leaders don't have to believe it themselves,'' Zhu says.
``But they have to make everybody else say they believe it.
Everybody is acting in a play.'' So long as most people agree to
keep acting _ and most do, usually because they see no plausible
alternative for China right now _ the Communist show can go on.
 &HT;    In the end, Zhu had to cut more than 10 percent of the material
in his book, which was finally published in 1998 in a respectable
printing of 30,000 that is mostly sold out.
 &HT;    He went on to write his autobiography, which he called ``A Minor
Scholar in Major Times.'' It is a memoir of betrayed hopes and an
almost comical train of misfortunes through Mao's campaigns, with
homage to the sheer creativity of the persecutors. And because the
manuscript was not a direct analysis of Communist history it was
published this year without prior vetting, by the prestigious
Peking University Press.
 &HT;    Making use of new materials made available in recent years, even
some party scholars have published more revelatory accounts of
events such as the Cultural Revolution. Still, because they cross
that line drawn in 1981, a number of major manuscripts covering the
Mao period languish in office drawers or are passed around,
samizdat-style, among like-minded scholars.
 &HT;    At a formal level, the Communist Party is producing a major new
official history of the revolution. A first fat volume covering the
period from the party's founding in 1921 to its victory in 1949
appeared in the early 1990s.
 &HT;    The second volume, covering the tortured years up to 1978, is
expected by the end of this year. It would be a mistake, however,
to anticipate any major reappraisals of Mao or his destructive
campaigns. A chief editor of Volume 2 just happens to be one of
those three party historians who, back in 1996, so politely
censored Zhu Zheng's manuscript.

`MYSTERY, ALASKA' SPORTS A FEW SURPRISES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's see a show of hands of those who think the Mystery hockey
team, all pluck and humble and lucky in their exhibition showdown
against a top team from the National Hockey League, will give the
New York Rangers what for. Uh-huh.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's see a show of hands of those who think the movie
``Mystery, Alaska'' will be pretty realistic, with the Rangers
skating circles around the ragtag collection of skating pumpkins
and emotional wombats that make up the amateur team from Mystery.
</P>
<P>
   OK.
</P>
<P>
   Well, looks like you're going to have to go see the movie after
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mystery, Alaska'' is still predictable. It's just not as
predictable as the rest of its kind. It takes you down to the last
goal without tipping off which way the whole thing's going to go.
</P>
<P>
   For a movie like this, that's about all you can ask for.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake. ``Mystery, Alaska'' is in the same mold as
``Bad News Bears'' and ``Hoosiers'' and ``Slapshot'' _ all those
Underdog Uber Alles movies that Hollywood churns out. It's a
product of the largely vanilla thinking of David E. Kelley (``Ally
McBeal,'' ``The Practice,'' ``Picket Fences'') and Jay Roach,
director of the Austin Power blockbusters, but it has its moments.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Crowe, the New Zealand native who played the hard-faced
detective in ``L.A. Confidential,'' is making a pretty good living
playing Americans. He does it again, quite well, in ``Mystery.'' As
town sheriff and captain of the hockey team, Crowe has the look,
sound and moves of a rolling-toward-middle- age American man.
</P>
<P>
   Colm Meany (the dad in ``The Commitments'') is solid. So are
Mary McCormack as Crowe's wife and Lolita Davidovitch as Meaney's
wife.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Eldard is perfect as the team's sleazy womanizer, and the
other players do themselves proud _ notably newcomers Ryan
Northcott as a high school standout and Kevin Durand as Tree Lane.
</P>
<P>
   Burt Reynolds holds his own, although at this stage of his
career he can't play anything but Burt Reynolds, and Rachel Wilson
_ Northcott's girlfriend _ has a face and manner that keep you
looking and looking. That's good because the cliched nature of the
small-town doings in Mystery, population 600, get pretty dreary.
</P>
<P>
   It's kind of a snowbound Peyton Place, with husbands forgiving
wives and wives forgiving husbands every time you turn around.
</P>
<P>
   Add the outback smugness of these people, the everyday sameness
of themselves, and this movie would be pretty close to unwatchable
if the cast weren't as good as it is.
</P>
<P>
   The plot is paper thin. As a publicity stunt, the New York
Rangers decide to play the team from Mystery after a writer native
to the town features it in Sports Illustrated. The rest of the
movie is about whether the team can _ gosh, do you think? _ really
beat an NHL squad. It's a credit to the actors, director and
writers that ``Mystery'' holds your attention with nothing more
than that to work with.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere has something to do with it. Filmed near Canmore,
Alberta, ``Mystery'' has the right air of cold and isolation. (You
want to ask yourself, though, why the filmmakers didn't put the
town in Canada in the first place, since it's filmed in Canada and
a Canadian town is a lot more likely to think of itself as a hockey
town than an American one.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Mystery'' has some tears when they're called for, an R rating
because youngsters talk dirty, plus a little Mike Myers and Little
Richard when things get too sticky. And it's not quite as
predictable as you would think.

TEENS PURSUE SWEET REVENGE IN `DRIVE ME CRAZY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``To make an impact, you have to go to extremes,'' Nicole, the
popular blond socialite (Melissa Joan Hart, also known as Sabrina
the Teenage Witch), says to Chase, the mop-top politico (Adrian
Grenier, also known as Sebastian Cole).
</P>
<P>
   This means a trip to The Gap, where he can shed those track
pants and Biohazard T-shirt for khakis and an oxford topped with a
leather jacket, his Greg Brady curls turned into a different
hairdon't.
</P>
<P>
   If the 12th-grader were to get any more extreme, he'd have to
start wearing a leather trench coat. But this is ``Drive Me
Crazy,'' an impressively competent ``how will male teen star get
with female teen star at high school dance?'' romance, so this
doesn't get any darker than the eyeliner of its anime-goth girls.
</P>
<P>
   Adapted by Rob Thomas from Todd Strasser's novel ``How I Created
My Perfect Prom Date,'' the film has the good sense not to give in
to these kids' belief that high school is cordoned off so that
social spheres don't intersect.
</P>
<P>
   They are in this Utah suburbia where a girl still lets the rest
of town know how she feels about ``him'' by cruising down Broadway
listening to Night Ranger, and where the dance is called
``Centennial,'' which looks a lot like the ``She's All That'' prom,
and check out the gay guy, chilling with the beautiful people.
</P>
<P>
   Though, come to think of it, these kids appear to be attending a
magnet school. Still, there's something sweetly retrograde about
Nicole and Chase being dumped days before ``Centennial,'' then
teaming up as a new couple to make their ex'es jealous. Hart and
Grenier have a flirty ``who'da thunk it?'' chemistry that seems
like he's making a play for her TGIF lineup and she's making a stab
at his burgeoning indie-movie fame.
</P>
<P>
   It's fun watching her go nuts at a Donnas concert (the
Ramones-for-girls band plays a group called the Electrocutes) and
seeing him get psyched about watching what may be the worst varsity
basketball game ever put on film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crazy'' _ directed by John Schultz like that one kid who loves
the cafeteria food so much, he convinces you it might be good _
smudges the lines between the popular and the pariah-ed.
</P>
<P>
   The best scenes involve a couple of Chase's techno-geek buddies
(Kris Park and Mark Webber), who are nothing like his irritating
cafe friends. They want into Chase's new world as much as they
resent him for his sudden access to it. It's easy for a guy like
Chase to be liked schoolwide because he has a crossover appeal that
allows him to break through without selling out, regardless of
where he shops, which is really what this movie's saying: Everybody
invests.

PALE LOVE OF `GUINEVERE' INSPIRES CROCODILE TEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Audrey Wells' debut directorial feature, ``Guinevere,'' is a
love story so implausibly dainty that when its San Francisco
heroine is sent packing from her older boyfriend/mentor's
Embarcadero loft and back to the slums of Pacific Heights, you'll
want to shed a crocodile tear.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Polley, making the most of a girl underwritten, is Harper
Stone, a 20-year-old loner who scraps her Harvard law plans to take
up with Connie, a creepy Irish photographer (Stephen Rea) of a
certain age.
</P>
<P>
   They meet at her older sister's wedding _ he agrees to cut her
out of the pictures he's snapping _ and she's already in love. The
burgeoning relationship has the requisite queasiness that an affair
between a Bob Dylan-circa-now-looking Rea and any woman a third his
age should.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than go for a quirky _ OK, crazy _ older
guy-waaay-younger woman romance, Wells goes the professor-protege
route, couching the affair in pretentious tutorials about art and
its metaphors for living. All Harper has to do to live with Rea is
something creative, you know, paint, write or dance _ ``You're
mistaking me for someone with potential,'' she warns. ``I don't
make mistakes,'' he warns back _ and not be too freaked out when he
starts calling her Guinevere.
</P>
<P>
   One supposes it's a fair deal: The alcoholic Connie gets some
affection; Harper the girl gets to learn about Alfred Stieglitz and
sit at the Harper's magazine equivalent of the Algonquin
round-table, which, in Gina Gershon (sporting Minnie Driver
pigtails), has its own Edna Ferber.
</P>
<P>
   Gershon plays the sour-grapes painter who's seen Connie's moves
before and tries to warn Harper: She too was once a Guinevere,
which as it turns out is a round-table of sexy Mays to Rea's
rumpled December. But Gershon never comes out and says, ``Eeeww,
get out!'' No one does, not even the gospel-soul singers who
serenade Harper at a surprise birthday party Connie throws for her.
</P>
<P>
   God bless Jean Smart as Harper's bitch-and-brandy mother. She's
the only person in this boho fantasy who seems to know what's going
on. Granted, she has one foot on the ground and the other dangling
from a Town Car, but she prunes the roses it takes an hour for this
movie to wake up and smell.
</P>
<P>
   Mom breezes into Connie's loft and sagely offers the ``you're a
dirty old man'' speech her ``Designing Women'' character was too
dumb to give. Smart is so piercing that you pity Rea, whom Wells,
writer of the far more direct and insightful ``The Truth About Cats
and Dogs,'' uses as a Michael Douglas-Sean Connery stand-in.
</P>
<P>
   Her vehemence gives ``Guinevere'' a purposeful Kodak moment in
Wells' scrapbook of underdeveloped Polaroids.

WORKER ERROR LEADS TO LETHAL RADIATION LEAK IN JAPAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHARON MOSHAVI  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ In what experts call the world's worst nuclear accident
since Chernobyl, dangerous levels of radiation leaked from a
uranium processing plant, creating an uncontrolled nuclear reaction
that exposed 19 people to radiation poisoning and forced the
evacuation of hundreds living near the factory.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the leak, radiation levels immediately outside the
plant, in the town of Tokaimura, were as much as 10,000 times the
normal level, and 10 times the normal rate at a distance of 1 1/4
miles from the plant, according to government officials.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, officials said the nuclear chain reaction appeared
to have halted, but they were seeking confirmation from radiation
monitors at the plant, which processes uranium for nuclear fuel.
</P>
<P>
   An official at the Science and Technology Agency said that while
neutron levels appeared to have fallen, suggesting that the chain
reaction was over, it had yet to verify that this in fact had taken
place.
</P>
<P>
   Radiation specialists had been sent to the plant 70 miles
northeast of Tokyo, but more than 20 hours after the accident it
was still too dangerous for them to enter the facility. Rain began
to fall in the hours after the accident, prompting concerns that it
could spread the radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Government spokesman Hiromu Nonaka called the accident
``unprecedented,'' although it is much more localized and less
threatening than an accident at a nuclear-energy plant such as
Chernobyl.
</P>
<P>
   It is certain to raise concerns here about Japan's heavy
reliance on nuclear power, particularly since it has already faced
a series of mishaps at nuclear facilities in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the reaction apparently occurring within the plant
could end any number of ways. It could, at some point, fizzle out
once it has used up its radioactive material. But there's also the
possibility that the reaction could lead to some sort of chemical
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese officials were slow to respond to the accident, and
initially played down its severity. At first, only 150 people
living within 350 yards of the plant were evacuated. Officials
later ordered 310,000 people living within a six-mile radius of the
plant to remain indoors with their windows closed, but these
warnings did not come until 12 hours after the accident was first
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Officials, though, may not have known until late in the
afternoon, hours after the accident, that a nuclear reaction was
taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Three workers are believed to have caused the accident on
Thursday morning when they were engaged in the delicate and
dangerous task of processing 35 pounds of uranium into fuel for
nuclear power plants, according to Makata Ujihara, head of the
Tokyo office of JCO Co., the private company which operates the
plant. The three workers reported that they saw a flash of blue
light, and then became nauseous and sick.
</P>
<P>
   The blue light is thought to be a sign of a ``criticality
incident,'' which is the point at which a nuclear chain reaction
occurs, similar to what happens inside a nuclear reactor.
</P>
<P>
   But a storage facility like the uranium processing plant does
not possess the controls or safeguards that a nuclear reactor
would. The three workers exposed to high levels of radiation were
transferred by helicopter from a local hospital to one specializing
in radiation sickness.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the workers are in a state of shock and have fever and
diarrhea, as well as highly elevated white blood cell counts,
according to hospital officials.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven other workers plus five nearby residents are being
treated for lower-level radiation exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We apologize from the bottom of our hearts,'' said Koji
Kitani, president of the operating firm JCO Co., as he bowed deeply
in apology at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Rain falling over the area is raising concern. It can prevent
radioactivity from dispersing in the air, and instead push it back
down toward the ground. Residents are being advised to immediately
wipe off any rain that lands on them.
</P>
<P>
   Railway service to the Tokaimura area has been suspended. All
schools and universities within a radius of 6 miles of the plant
were ordered closed on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese government has announced the formation of a task
force to investigate the leak. Japanese media are also reporting
that the government is asking for US assistance.
</P>
<P>
   With few natural energy resources, Japan relies heavily on
nuclear power. It has 51 commercial nuclear power reactors that
provide the country with one-third of all its electricity.
</P>
<P>
   But public faith in the safety of nuclear power has been waning
as Japan has suffered several serious nuclear accidents. In fact,
the country's worst accident prior to this also took place at the
Tokaimura facility, although in a different building. In that
accident, in March 1997, a fire caused 37 workers to be exposed to
low-level radiation.
</P>
<P>
   In July, radioactive cooling water leaked from a cracked pipe in
a nuclear reactor 200 miles west of Tokyo. Radiation levels within
the plant briefly reached levels 11,500 times over the safety
limit, but no radiation was leaked into the atmosphere, and no one
was injured.

   WASHINGTON _ In a fresh sign of Bill Bradley's surging strength

reported Thursday that he raised more money in the last quarter
than Vice President Al Gore, leaving both candidates nearly tied in
the financial race with about $10 million each in cash on hand.

more than any presidential candidate in history. Aside from
publisher Steve Forbes, who is self-financing much of his campaign,
Bush's closest competitor is Senator John McCain of Arizona, who
has raised $9.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The devolopment that Bradley has about the same financial
resources as Gore is significant because it shows the two
candidates are neck-and-neck in the all-important ``money
primary,'' which is being waged more furiously than ever because of
next year's compressed voting schedule. It also shows why the vice
president announced Wednesday that he is moving his headquarters to
Nashville and cutting his staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who write checks for $1,000 to the campaigns are
among those most interested in shifts in the polls, and they are
beginning to vote with their pocketbook,'' said Larry Makinson,
executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, which
tracks money and politics.
</P>
<P>
   The long-term significance of the report, meanwhile, is that
Bush _ if he become the GOP nominee _ could be flush with cash for
several months while his Democratic opponent would be nearly broke.
That is because Bush _ unlike the two Democrats _ is not abiding by
a spending cap.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign has been spending heavily even as the candidate
drops in the polls. Gore now is hoping for free media provided by
debates, which might reinvigorate his fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley raised about $6.7 million between July and September,
compared to $6.5 million for Gore, according to reports filed
Thursday with the Federal Election Commission. During the same
time, Bradley spent $4.2 million, while Gore spent around $6
million. Politically during that period, Bradley climbed to a
statistical tie with Gore in New Hampshire polls and benefited from
a flood of publicity, including the cover of this week's Time
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   All told, Bradley has raised $18.4 million this year, while Gore
has brought in $24 million, despite the early belief that the vice
president could use his party connections to bring in far more
money than the former New Jersey senator. But with Gore spending so
heavily and Bradley conserving his resources, the two are nearly
even with cash on hand, with Gore reporting $9.5 million to $10
million, and Bradley saying he has $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that in terms of fund-raising, Bradley has clearly
been the candidate who exceeded expectations,'' said Anthony
Corrado, a government professor at Maine's Colby College who
studies campaign finance. ``The expectation was that Bradley was
going to have difficulty being financially competitive with Gore.
It is clear now that is not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Fairly or not, the amount of money raised by a candidate often
is seen as a crucial test of support, so Thursday's results are
bound to increase Bradley's stock, helping him convince more people
to support his campaign. Gore, meanwhile, is likely to use the
Bradley surge to rally supporters who may have been holding back
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican financial reports again demonstrated Bush's
strength and the weaknesses of most other GOP candidates. Bush has
broken fund-raising records after rejecting federal matching funds,
taking in $19 million in the last quarter alone.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign treasury was bolstered by five-figure
``bundles'' of money in the last quarter from big companies like
First Energy Corp. of Ohio, and the national accounting firm of
Ernst &AMP; Young. Employees in former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Roger
Staubach's commercial real estate firm gave more than $5,000 and
other notable donors included anti-affirmative action activist Ward
Connerly, members of Colorado's Coors beer family and a dozen or
more Washington lawyer-lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign, which has been regularly updating its donor
list on the Internet, Thursday released an appendix to its list of
fund-raising ``pioneers'' _ individuals who promised to raise at
least $100,000 for the Texas governor this year. It included
Staubach and, from Massachusetts, Martha Chayet of Manchester,
Chris Jenny of Wayland and former Governor William F. Weld.
</P>
<P>
   The only candidate likely to come close to Bush's financial
strength is Forbes, who is self-financing much of his campaign.
According to Thursday's report, Forbes raised $1.4 million in the
last quarter, bringing his total to $4.2 million. But that does not
include the $9.5 million that Forbes contributed to his effort the
last quarter, or the $6.6 million he gave to his campaign in the
prior two quarters. If Forbes's own contributions are counted, he
has raised $20.3 million, and he says he has the personal resources
to compete with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law allows a candidate to contribute unlimited funds to
his or her own campaign, while other individuals may give no more
than $1,000 per election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans gave the following reports Thursday: McCain
raised $3 million during the quarter, bringing his total to $9.3
million; Gary Bauer raised $2 million during the last quarter,
bringing his total this year to $5.4 million; and Elizabeth Dole
raised $1.5 million, for a year-to-date total of $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, making his first financial report,
has raised $1.2 million, while talk show host Alan Keyes brought in
$500,000 during the quarter for total of $2.4 million. Patrick J.
Buchanan, who is considering dropping out of the GOP and seeking
the Reform Party nomination, has raised $4 million so far.
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle, who dropped out of the race on
Monday due to financial problems, did not release a report
Thursday. An aide acknowledged the campaign is in debt but declined
to be specific, adding that the accounting books will be in balance
after federal matching funds are received.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush's financial strength helps him win the nomination after
an early round of primaries, he could still have tens of millions
of dollars to spend in preparation for the general election. That
is likely to be far more money than is available to the Democratic
nominee, because both Democratic candidates are taking matching
funds and have agreed to spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, while the Democratic nominee might be waiting for
the infusion of federal money provided after the national
convention, Bush could spend millions of dollars during the later
stages of the primary season to establish his campaign and attack
the Democrats. That is similar to the scenario Bob Dole faced in
1996, when he was short on funds after a brutal GOP primary fight
and had no money to respond to attacks from Clinton, who had plenty
of funds because he faced no primary opposition.

HITMAN ADMITS KILLING   10 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The scowl he wore while learning of the endless
betrayals by his longtime Winter Hill Gang cohorts James ``Whitey''
Bulger and Stephen Flemmi was gone as John Martorano strolled into
a federal courtroom Thursday and calmly pleaded guilty to killing
10 people.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing relaxed and slightly tanned _ and looking more like a
businessman than a confessed hitman in his grey pin-striped suit,
pale blue shirt and yellow-grey tie _ Martorano took another step
toward paying back FBI informants Bulger and Flemmi.
</P>
<P>
   Martorano, 58, pleaded guilty to killing 10 people in the 1970s
on behalf of a racketeering enterprise _ the Winter Hill Gang _ as
well as racketeering, extortion and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   A plea agreement calls for his cooperation against Bulger,
Flemmi and any former FBI agents being targeted in an ongoing
corruption probe.
</P>
<P>
   Martorano also agreed to plead guilty to second-degree murder
charges in Oklahoma and Florida _ two states with the death penalty
_ with assurances that he'll only face a 15-year prison term. He's
also confessed to another eight murders during the 1960s and 70s
for which he'll never be charged.
</P>
<P>
   Martorano has implicated Bulger as an accomplice in three
murders and Flemmi in half a dozen slayings, according to sources.
Last year, as he listened grim-faced in federal court, Martorano
learned that Bulger and Flemmi were longtime FBI informants who
betrayed both their friends and the Mafia in exchange for FBI
protection.
</P>
<P>
   US District Judge Mark L. Wolf accepted Martorano's plea, but
postponed any decision on whether he'll go along with a government
recommendation to sentence Martorano to 12 1/2 to 15 years in
prison. If the judge rejects the recommendation, Martorano can
withdraw his plea and the deal would fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to choke him, he's sitting there unremorseful,'' said
Richard Castucci after Martorano admitted killing his father,
Richard, a 47-year-old Revere nightclub owner, on Dec. 30, 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Martorano says that he, Bulger and Flemmi killed Castucci, who
was found shot to death in the trunk of a car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're treating him very nicely for admitting to
killing all these men,'' said Denise Castucci, who was 21 when her
father was slain.
</P>
<P>
   But in a telephone interview, David Wheeler, the son of another
one of Martorano's victims, said Martorano's deal is ``the price we
pay to get to the leaders, the people who ran the Winter Hill Gang,
the people who have enjoyed the protection of the FBI.''
</P>
<P>
   Martorano has admitted gunning down Roger Wheeler, chairman of
Telex Corp. and owner of World Jai Alai, outside a Tulsa country
club on May 27, 1981, but says the murder was orchestrated by
Bulger and Flemmi to hide the fact that the Winter Hill Gang was
skimming profits from Wheeler's company.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's handling of the Wheeler case is under investigation by
a grand jury. The FBI failed to tell Tulsa investigators that an
informant _ who was later gunned down _ had implicated Bulger and
Flemmi in Wheeler's slaying.
</P>
<P>
   Defending the deal with Martorano, US Attorney Donald K. Stern
said it marked a ``somewhat rocky and long road to justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Martorano's cooperation, Stern said the 20 murders he
confessed to would have remained unsolved and nobody would ever be
punished for them.
</P>
<P>
   Martorano's cousin, Joe, who attended Thursday's hearing, said,
``I hope he gets a fair shake. I think it's best to get everything
out on the table where it belongs. Let the chips fall where they
may _ FBI or no FBI.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, black community leaders urged authorities to
investigate whether Martorano killed more blacks than the four he
has admitted to. They cited a Globe column last year by former
columnist Mike Barnicle that quoted retired Boston Police Detective
Eddie Walsh saying that Martorano ``used blacks for target
practice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I know, it's fantasy and made up,'' said Stern,
adding that if Martorano is caught lying, his deal is void and he
could be prosecuted for murder.
</P>
<P>
   Within law enforcement circles Walsh's statements have been
viewed as an effort to sabotage Martorano's deal to prevent him
from testifying against Bulger. Bulger's former handler, retired
FBI Agent John Connolly, has described Walsh to reporters as his
``cousin.''

SAVER NEEDS TO STEP UP PACE TO WARD OFF EFFECTS OF INFLATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, September 03, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 37 years old and make a salary of $36,000 a year. I
purchased a condo a year ago, with a $134,000 mortgage requiring a
$1,134 monthly payment. I pay an extra $100 a month and the current
balance is $132,000. (Is this a good idea?) I put the maximum
allowed into my IRA, and have no debt other than the mortgage. An
IRA with T. Rowe Prices Science and Technology fund is now worth
$14,700. Another IRA in Vanguard Index 500 holds $3,300. A Roth
IRA, also with Vanguard, has a $2,000 balance divided between the
Index 500 and Health Care funds. On the taxable side, I have an
additional $8,800 in Prices Science and Technology, and at Vanguard
I have $8,000 in the Prime Money Market fund, $25,200 in Index 500
fund, and $6,400 in Health Care. In addition to my IRA investments,
I add $200 a month to the Index 500 position and $100 a month to
Health Care. I plan to work until I am 50 to 55. How do things look
for my retirement?
</P>
<P>
   M.W., Anaheim Hills, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. To be honest, it looks a little shaky. I'll focus on retiring
at age 55, because the numbers come a little closer at that point.
If you continue saving at your current rate and realized an average
investment return of 10 percent a year, your total savings would
amount to $717,191, which you might calculate could bring you a
$46,617 income stream (presuming a 6.5 percent yield from a
fixed-income portfolio). But there are two problems, both involving
inflation. One is that you are living on $29,208 a year at this
point _ your income minus that amount you are saving. If inflation
averages 3.5 percent, after 19 years you will need $56,152 to buy
the same goods and services that $29,208 buys today. You might
calculate that your mortgage would be paid off at that point, so
you would be about even. But you still would have very little money
available to produce the capital growth that will be needed to
protect you against the inevitable inflation that will come in the
later years of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to me that unless you can advance the level of your
savings, you would probably be better off targeting retirement at
age 60, by which point you would have accumulated $1,192,073,
following the same assumptions as above. At that point you would be
within a couple of years of eligibility for Social Security, and
your mortgage would probably be paid off, whether or not you
continue to make that $100 prepayment.
</P>
<P>
   As for the question of prepayment, I usually lean in favor of
prepaying the mortgage, following the old-fashioned assumption that
outright ownership of your home is one of cornerstones of financial
stability. But if the mortgage is only a year old, you probably
have a very low interest rate. Further, by prepaying the mortgage,
you are eating away at the amount of the interest deduction you can
take on your tax returns. And since it is reasonable to expect that
in the long haul your investments will earn a higher return than
the interest rate on your mortgage, I think I would suggest that
you divert those $100 monthly prepayments to your investment
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I'd be happier if you focused a little more on core
portfolio holdings. I estimate that 45 percent of your investments
at this point are in the health care and science and technology
funds, which I think is too much. I would not debate that in the
long haul these sectors are likely to outpace the market as a
whole, but they also represent a higher degree of risk. I would
rather see these positions represent about 15 percent each, with
the portfolio being rounded out through inclusion of small cap,
mid-cap, and international funds. I wouldn't make any changes in
the current holdings, but I suggest you stop building the sector
positions and divert your ongoing contributions to the new
categories.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have two children, aged nine and six. Currently their
college fund contains $6,500 with $4,800 in Vanguard's Health Care
fund and $1,700 in Dupree North Carolina Tax-Free Income fund. I
will have $10,000 to invest before the end of the year and plan to
contribute $300 a month thereafter. Could you suggest an allocation
within the Vanguard funds for this money, as well as a strategy for
reallocations as they get older?
</P>
<P>
   R.S., Garner, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   A. Although I've always been a big fan of Vanguard's Health Care
fund, I'm not sure I would place such heavy reliance upon it as you
are doing. Although the fund has a great track record and it
provides prospects of handsome rewards for long-term holders, I
think at the minimum you should reduce your reliance upon it in
these intermediate-term accounts. I suggest you reduce the position
in that fund to $3,000, mentally earmarking $1,500 of the money for
each child. I would then divide the remaining money into pools of
$6,750, mentally earmarked for each child. For the elder child, you
might put $3,000 of the money in Vanguard Wellington and the rest
in Vanguard GNMA. For the younger child, I'd suggest putting $3,000
in Vanguard Windsor II and the balance in Vanguard Wellington.
</P>
<P>
   Once the elder child gets within your years of college age, I
would swap the Wellington position for Vanguard's Short-Term
Corporate Bond fund, and in each succeeding year I would move one
quarter of the money from the GNMA fund into the Short-Term Bond
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, once college begins, I would move whatever money is to
be used during each year into the Vanguard Prime Money Market fund,
from which you could make the disbursements as the bills come due.
</P>
<P>
   I would follow the a similar procedure with the younger child,
swapping the Windsor II shares for GNMA when the student is age 9,
and then following the same procedure as you did with the older
child.
</P>
<P>
   Since I presume the tax-free bond fund holding was purchased
with a view to your own tax situation, Id suggest no change there.
Moreover, if your tax situation dictates it, you might buy more
shares of that holding instead of the Vanguard fixed-income funds.
</P>
<P>
   As for the money that was in Vanguard Health Care: since that's
the vehicle with the greatest prospect of growth, you'll want to
leave it in that fund for as long as possible to get the maximum
potential benefit. I'd tend to think of that money as funds which
are likely to be drawn upon in each child's final year of school,
and thus leave it invested in the fund until college begins, at
which point it might be moved into the Short-Term Corporate Bond
account.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have noticed that financial planning columns such as yours
routinely and consistently advise shifting from growth to income
investments for retirement and old age. This has always puzzled me
greatly. I am 69 and retired. A fair portion of my retirement nest
egg is in some insurance stock I purchased 42 years ago for $800
and is now worth about $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   The dividend is only 1.5 percent. In addition I own mutual funds
that are strictly growth, and a variable annuity that is likewise
in growth stocks. This investment strategy has proved to be nothing
short of fabulous for me, and I intend to maintain it until I die,
a which time my children will likewise benefit handsomely. Not only
has the total return greatly exceeded what any income strategy
would have produced, but the income tax advantages continue to be
enormous also. Am I missing something?
</P>
<P>
   S.C., Andover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I think so. I think that you've been in a bull market for so
long that you've forgotten what happened from time to time back in
the dark ages _ when the stock market went down, moved sideways,
went down again, then went sideways again. (Think back to the 70s
and perhaps you'll remember.)
</P>
<P>
   The high-growth strategy is great for accumulating retirement
funds, but it is too risky for most people once they get into
retirement. You have to be very brave (or foolhardy), or very rich,
to live with such a strategy without worries.
</P>
<P>
   Of course many people get locked into investments such as your
insurance stock, where the gains have been so large that your base
costs represent a token amount, and the tax effect of sales would
seem punitive. Perhaps there's nothing to be done about that, but I
certainly would swap some of the stock funds and the variable
annuity holding for more conservative investments if I were you. I
also bet you won't. Good luck.

FLEET-BANKBOSTON MERGER CLEARS FINAL HURDLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ State officials gave a final nod Thursday to Fleet
Financial Group Inc.'s proposed acquisition of BankBoston Corp.,
eliminating the last regulatory hurdle to a deal that creates New
England's dominant bank.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Board of Bank Incorporation unanimously
endorsed the $16 billion transaction, which the two banks expect to
formally close Friday. The agency's sign-off is the final green
light for the two Boston-based companies to forge ahead in the
arduous task of melding two different cultures into the nation's
eighth-largest bank.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at both companies declined to comment on what two
industry sources said Thursday was new consideration in recent days
by Fleet chief executive Terrence Murray to call the holding
company of the new bank Fleet Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet's current ticker symbol on the New York Stock Exchange,
FLT, would remain for the new company, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe reported earlier this week that Murray has insisted
that the main retail bank _ the core of the new company _ bear the
Fleet name only. The Globe, citing sources familiar with the
matter, also reported that certain BankBoston portions of the new
company _ the Latin American franchise and San-Francisco investment
bank Robertson Stephens _ would retain their current names, though
the latter would drop its BankBoston prefix.
</P>
<P>
   The banks expect to announce a new, 22-person board next week,
Fleet spokesman James Mahoney said. The board is scheduled to hold
its first meeting in the third week of October.
</P>
<P>
   Since New England's largest bank deal was announced in March,
industry analysts on Wall Street and elsewhere have wondered how
two companies widely viewed as different would work together to
meld their operations.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, in a brief telephone interview Thursday, said his
relationship with his BankBoston counterpart, Charles K. Gifford,
was ``professional, collaborative, and in the spirit of getting the
job done.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked how he and Gifford made decisions, Murray replied:
``We go one way (on one matter), then next time we try to yield to
the other person.'' Murray is chairman and chief executive of the
new company, with Gifford in the number two position of president
and chief operating officer. Gifford is scheduled to take the top
post at the end of 2001, when Murray will retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a merger of equals,'' Murray said, repeating a
phrase often pronounced by Gifford. Some industry analysts have
said that so-called mergers of equals end up as transactions in
which the culture and ethos of the acquiring company dominates.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the Fleet-BankBoston merger won support Thursday
from Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who had
opposed the deal. While Blumenthal has no regulatory power over the
transaction, his office could have filed lawsuits designed to delay
or block the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad, stark fact is that an antitrust lawsuit was
critically undercut by two key federal agency approvals,''
Blumenthal said in a statement, referring to recent approvals by
the Justice Department and Federal Reserve for the merger.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint press release with the Connecticut treasurer,
Blumenthal said Fleet had agreed to divest an additional seven
Connecticut branches and invest an additional $700 million, or
total $2.9 billion, in state community projects. Fleet also agreed
to set aside two branches previously sold to Wyomissing, Pa.-based
Sovereign Bancorp for purchase by a minority-owned bank.
</P>
<P>
   A local banking source said Thursday that Boston Bank of
Commerce, a leading minority-owned bank, planned to bid on the two
Connecticut branches. BBOC is also trying to buy five Boston-based
branches, but negotiations with Fleet have stalled over price
differences.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, under a major divestiture of assets, Sovereign
bought more than 270 Fleet and BankBoston branches, with nearly $13
billion in deposits. Murray said Sovereign would employ 900 people
more than expected, and that job cuts from the merger would be less
than 2,500. An equal number of positions will be eliminated through
attrition.

RED SOX LOSE; GARCIAPARRA SENT HOME 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-WHITE SOX-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ This was the anti-clinching.
</P>
<P>
   A night after they secured their second straight American League
playoff berth, not only were the Red Sox eliminated from the East
race, but they discovered their buoyant hopes for October may be in
peril.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop/catalyst Nomar Garciaparra, the AL batting leader,
left Comiskey Park just before Thursday &UR;  &LR; night's game, and as a
makeshift lineup of his teammates was falling to the White Sox,
5-2, he was on his way home to Boston to have his ailing right
wrist reevaluated.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra was hit by a pitch from the Orioles' Alberto Reyes
Saturday, and X-rays that night revealed no broken bones. In fact,
Garciaparra struck the homer Wednesday that beat the White Sox,
6-2, and guaranteed baseball this month at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   But before the Red Sox were consigned to the wild card
Thursday &UR;  &LR; night by the first-place Yankees' 12-5 rout of Baltimore,
manager Jimy Williams said, ``If you'd seen him taking practice
(Wednesday), he hit some balls off the end of the bat and it hurt.
We've talked about his health, what's the correct way to handle
it.''
</P>
<P>
   With the wild card in the bank and chances of catching the
Yankees remote, Williams already had decided to sit out Garciaparra
Thursday &UR;  &LR; night and Friday night in Baltimore. According to trainer
Jim Rowe, Garciaparra complained that the wrist was still bothering
him after he arrived at Comiskey Thursday and requested that more
tests be conducted. Rowe said ``there are a couple of other things
that can be done'' but wouldn't specify what they are. He indicated
that team physician Arthur Pappas probably will have an update
after examining Garciaparra Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra was still on the premises an hour before game time,
and team spokesman Kevin Shea announced the All-Star's departure
just before the first pitch. Shea emphasized that the move is
strictly precautionary.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams said, ``We'll have to see what the docs say. It's
just not healing the way he felt it should be. With him not playing
tonight and tomorrow, we decided it was best to send him back
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that there is no fracture, Garciaparra's status for the
Division Series next week would not seem to be in jeopardy.
``Nomar's going to play,'' promised catcher Jason Varitek,
``whether he's hurt or not.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's no doubt that a lingering wrist ailment could be a
major impediment for the player the Red Sox most heavily rely on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not good news at this point in the season,'' said
outfielder Darren Lewis, who had similar wrist problems earlier
this year. ``Hopefully, he'll be OK. I know he had X-rays and he
told me it wasn't broken. I know it takes time to go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to heal. I had it and it took two months. His
won't heal until after the season. At this point, I'm sure that if
he can, he'll play through the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra's situation turned the night into a complete
throwaway for the Red Sox. The Yankees, who needed only a win over
the Orioles or a Boston loss to retain the East title, were doubly
blessed. Within seconds after New York polished off Baltimore,
pinch hitter Varitek's bid for a go-ahead ninth-inning grand slam
off wobbly Chicago closer Bob Howry died at the center-field fence,
where Brian Simmons made a spectacular catch as he crashed
headfirst into the barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Since a New York pennant was virtually a foregone conclusion,
anyway, the Red Sox deployed a wild-card lineup that wasn't exactly
the junior varsity but never would be on display as a unit in a
high-stakes situation. Not surprisingly, the woeful White Sox took
advantage as Carlos Lee's seventh-inning homer off Brian Rose
snapped a 2-2 tie and Magglio Ordonez's two-run shot off John
Wasdin in the eighth put it away.

 HIBBING, Minn.: ... the way.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hibbing isn't known for its basketball players. It had one of
some renown _ Dick Garmaker, a former Knick _ before McHale came
along. Agent Bill Duffy, who roomed with McHale at the University
of Minnesota, visited the city and still is amazed that it spawned
one of the 50 greatest players of all time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like going to another country,'' Duffy said. ``I'm
thinking, `How could this guy come from here and be this good?' I
was from east LA and I had played high school ball against (Bill)
Laimbeer and Kiki (Vandeweghe) and (David) Greenwood. I had summer
camps and stuff like that. I mean, up there, there's hardly anyone
over 6-4. It just blew my mind.'''
</P>
<P>
   McHale had three coaches going through the Hibbing public
schools _ Maciej, Knezovich, and Gary Addington. Each one shaped
him in some way, to the point where when he got to Minnesota in
1976, he was as well-schooled and polished as any freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came down to the U and I was fundamentally sound. It's easy
to play when you're fundamentally sound,'' McHale said.
</P>
<P>
   Maciej, an art teacher, got the ultra-raw McHale in junior high
and marveled at his ability to have fun and still play hard. ``Once
he stepped on the floor, it was `don't mess with him.' But he
always found a way to separate the fun and the work,'' Maciej said.
He then passed McHale along to Knezovich, who had been watching
McHale for years.
</P>
<P>
   Knezovich had McHale in high school for only a year (he resigned
before the following season). But he was instrumental in teaching
McHale one of the Hall of Famer's most visible and valuable traits
_ holding the ball above his head when he got a rebound, stepping
out, and making the outlet pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he first started, he'd bring the ball down and I'd have
people intentionally hit him,'' Knezovich said. ``He went home
crying one day, but you know what? He learned to keep it up pretty
quick after that.'' Knezovich had another basic belief: protect the
baseline at all costs. McHale did.
</P>
<P>
   Addington had the biggest impact on McHale, so much so that
McHale chose him to be one of his presenters at the induction
ceremony. (Red Auerbach will be the other.) He had McHale for two
years and was a marked departure from the brusque, in-your-face,
post-up preferring Knezovich.
</P>
<P>
   ``He taught me more basketball than anyone else,'' McHale said
of Addington, who took McHale's senior-year team to the state
final, where it lost in the title game. ``I learned how to play
under him. We did a ton of drill work. You learned how to play the
whole game, not just one role. That served me for my whole
career.''
</P>
<P>
   Addington stayed at Hibbing for 13 years then moved on to
Rochester, where he oversees athletics at the city's three schools.
He and McHale have remained close socially, and he, too, has his
own cache of McHale stories, such as the one where McHale stayed on
the team bus and ended up going out to dinner with the bus driver
instead of being at the gym, ready to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't take a whole lot of credit for Kevin,'' he said. ``I
think I've been the primary beneficiary of our relationship. By the
end of his senior year, I knew he'd be a great college player. I
could see that. And after a year and a half at the U, I could see
he'd get to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   He went there and beyond, which is why Addington and Maciej were
part of the Hibbing-related contingent that made the trip to
Springfield. The group also included brother John and his family,
and McHale's mother. Friends like Duffy, `Bones,' and Big Joe also
are in town. Springfield may never recover.
</P>
<P>
   The Beanhead came, too, so the dock will have to wait a little
longer. After all, the house apparently isn't going anywhere
anytime soon.

 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIBBING, Minn. _ The Beanhead is concerned. He knows his friend
Kevin wants the dock cleaned (there's lots of loon droppings),
taken in, and stored for the brutal, Iron Range winter that is sure
to come. But he also knows Kevin wants the whole house torn down
because the roof leaks, the squirrels are inside, and, well, where
to put the dock if there's no house?
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'll just bring it in and wait,'' the Beanhead shrugs,
making his way up the staircase from Big Sturgeon Lake to Kevin
McHale's two-story house. Two bald eagles swoop over the property
and a loon bellows from the middle of the lake. With autumn color
visible at every angle, it's a striking snapshot of nature.
</P>
<P>
   In McHale's absence, and sometimes even in his presence, the
Beanhead does most of the grunt work here. But the staircase was
built by another of Kevin's friends, Terry Maciej, who also built
the beautiful oak bar in the basement of the house. But McHale
wants the house knocked down anyway and a log cabin, like
Beanhead's across the lake, built in its place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing's happened so far,'' said the Beanhead, also known as
Mark Badovinac, a 40-something heavy equipment worker who doubles
as McHale's Man Everyday on the Range. The Beanhead convinced
McHale to build a heated garage for McHale's seven boats, the
easier to store the assorted craft, which range from jet skis to a
pontoon boat. The Beanhead loves it here, as does McHale.
</P>
<P>
   But the Beanhead also thinks his buddy is a bit crazy to tear
down the house because of bad roof design or a few squirrels in the
television room. There's an expensive deck and oak moldings around
the doors. There are two prized mounted fish, a 64-pound king
salmon and a 10-pound walleye. There are McHale's two Sixth Man
Awards and the framed 1981 Sports Illustrated cover that shows him
``lowering the boom'' on Mo Cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   But it's now October, with winter approaching, and there's been
no decision. McHale says his wife, Lynn, doesn't want the place
razed so it likely will live to see another summer. His brother,
John, laughs when asked about the fate of the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin puts very little on his high priority list,'' he says.
``Sometimes trying to get him to make a decision is like trying to
catch the fog.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beanhead knows that as well as anyone. His relationship with
McHale is based on implicit, unconditional trust: they regularly go
on fishing trips to Canada and have shared a tent for five, rainy
days playing cribbage. One other sign of their mutual bond _ they
have a joint checking account.
</P>
<P>
   But the Beanhead is just one of many who know and value the Hall
of Fame inductee, not for what he did in Boston, but what he did
and does on the Range. They knew him when he was simply Kevin, a
tall, gangly kid who, like everyone else, liked to hunt, fish, and
have fun. The relationships are inviolate, regardless of one's net
worth, celebrity status, or address.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's Beanhead. There's Chris Liesmaki, a high school
basketball teammate, and Terry Sachs. There's his brother, John,
and his cousin, Jim, and assorted suckers at Mesaba Country Club,
where McHale inexplicably reigns as club champion. (``The stars and
planets must have been aligned weird this year,'' he says by way of
explanation.)
</P>
<P>
   There are hunting pals. There are fishing pals. There are
golfing pals. If McHale tries to get uppity with any of them, they
can remind him about the time he had to use a shovel to kill a
beaver because he ran out of shells. (There are pictures as well.)
Or the time he mistakenly inserted the pole for his basketball hoop
16 feet into the ground and needed a Jeep and a wench to extract
the digging bit. Anything is fair game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things that any of us could do which still couldn't
make us not be friends,'' McHale says. ``I try to be who I am no
matter where I am. You are who you are. A long time ago I quit
worrying about what people thought. But those guys don't expect you
to be different. It's relaxing.''
</P>
<P>
   In much the same way as Larry Bird found comfort and solitude in
French Lick, Ind., so does McHale when he returns here every summer
and fall. There is much for him here, whether it's visiting his
mother, Josie, who still lives in the same house where Kevin was
raised, hunting with his brother John, or trying to take some money
from Gary Yaeger, the pro at Mesaba.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why he comes here,'' Yaeger says. ``He can just be
Kevin and no one gives him a hard time. But on the course, when I
play him, his best weapon is his mouth. That's worth five shots a
round.''
</P>
<P>
   McHale laughs when he hears that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to yack at him when he'd have a 5-footer and he'd
always miss. Now he's gone to a new putter and he beats me all the
time. He says it's McHale-proof.''
</P>
<P>
   This city of 18,000 has produced an inordinate number of
celebrities given its size and location (180 miles north of the
Twin Cities). McHale, newly inducted into the Basketball Hall of
Fame in Springfield, Mass., isn't even the most famous. Bob
Zimmerman lived here from 1948 to 1959, the year he graduated from
Hibbing High School. He then went to the University of Minnesota,
changed his last name to Dylan, and before long his folk music
galvanized a generation. Roger Maris was born here but moved to
Fargo, N.D., at a young age; his family spelled its name M-A-R-A-S
when it lived in the area. Author/attorney Vincent Bugliosi lived
here for 17 years. Two Swedes wanted a way to get mine workers to
work and that begat the Greyhound Bus Line. The founder of Chun
King food products and the president of Pepsico Inc., are from the
area.
</P>
<P>
   But McHale and most of his friends moved in less exotic circles;
their parents either worked in the many Mesabi Range iron ore mines
or had mine-related jobs. Mining is Hibbing's raison d'etre and one
of the city's tourist attractions is the Hull-Rust-Mahoning mine,
the largest open pit mine in the world, 3 1/2 miles long and 1 1/2
miles wide.
</P>
<P>
   The mining company ran the city and Hibbing still is heavily
dependent on the industry. The mining company paid for the
magnificent high school, finished in 1923, which cost an astounding
$3.9 million. The piece de resistance is the auditorium, designed
after the Capitol Theater in New York. Among its highlights are
velvet seats and crystal chandeliers from Belgium, which cost
$15,000 apiece in 1920 and now are insured for $250,000 each. There
are more than 40 backdrops on the stage, each rising 90-plus feet.
There are eight single dressing rooms, modeled after those in
Broadway theaters, and a Barton pipe organ, one of only two in the
country, which pumps out organ music and, thanks to modern
technology, music from every orchestra instrument except the
violin. There's also a $75,000 Steinway grand piano.
</P>
<P>
   McHale's father, Paul, worked in the mines for US Steel for 42
years. One of McHale's high school coaches, Milan Knezovich, lied
about his age and went to work in the mines at the age of 14. It
was the thing to do. Mining and mining-related work made Hibbing a
melting pot of Germans, Finns, Serbs, Croats, Swedes, Italians, and
Irish. It also gave the town and its residents a well-deserved
reputation for hard work, something McHale saw every day at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father didn't expect to go to work and be told that he did
a good job,'' McHale says. ``You didn't expect anyone to pat you on
the back. You just did your job. That's how I approached
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Ken Anderson, the former coach at Wisconsin-Eau Claire who
tried to recruit McHale to his then-NAIA school: ``He had a great
work ethic, a typical young man off the range. That's all they
know. That's the way he was brought up and that had to help him
along the way.''

GRAHAME AT HOME IN BRUINS' NET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The job is his, for now, sort of, at least until, you
know, maybe there's an official celebration made down at City Hall
Plaza, or better yet, the Guvnah breaks out State House parchment
and declares Official John Grahame Backup Goalie Day in the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   By all reads of the tea leaves, Rob Tallas will start in net for
the Bruins Saturday night when they open the 1999-2000 season
against the Carolina Hurricanes. The 24-year-old Grahame, who
backed the Providence Bruins to the AHL Calder Cup championship
last spring, will be at the end of the bench, one giant stretch of
the pads from banking his first minute of NHL action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting,'' said Grahame, now on the eve of finishing his
third Bruins training camp. ``On the same hand, you don't want to
get too excited about it, because you don't know what's to come;
things can change.''
</P>
<P>
   He is in a state of suspended jubilation. Grahame can picture
himself at the FleetCenter, the Providence `P' on his chest
magically converted to a `B', a jubilant hometown crowd embracing a
new season. He can dream about maybe relieving Rob Tallas, or, who
knows, perhaps starting Monday night's game in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   But things can change. He is right here right now, in large
part, because No. 1 netminder Byron Dafoe won't return to work for
$3 million a year. If Dafoe were to sign today, tomorrow, or a
month of Sundays from tomorrow, the food chain above the Boston net
would change dramatically. Grahame would be gobbled up in a second
and returned to Providence.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes it kinda tough,'' acknowledged Grahame, who posted
a stellar 37-9-1 record and 2.90 goals-against average last year in
Providence. ``You come in and play well, you do everything that's
asked of you, and if Byron's back, it doesn't matter how well
you've played, you'll get sent down. But, hey, that's the way it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   His dad was a goalie, which means from an early age Grahame
understood netminder pragmatism and the math of the position (one
net equals one goalie equals one job). Ron Grahame was a Bruins
netminder in the '70s, and any Boston fan worth his or her
black-and-gold salt-'n-pepper shakers knows the Bruins swapped the
affable Ron Grahame for the Kings' first pick in the '79 draft.
That pick, No. 8 overall, has had Ray Bourque working the Boston
blue line for 20-plus years.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Grahame is an assistant athletic director at the University
of Denver, and his wife, Charlotte, is the office administrator for
Pierre Lacroix, GM of the Colorado Avalanche. When the Grahames
left Boston following Ron's trade to LA in October '78, John was 3
years old, but he has vivid memories of pulling on his dad's helmet
and gloves, the tools he used in net for the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after John Grahame left Lake Superior State to turn pro
with the Bruins in the fall of '97, his mother began working on a
Christmas gift, framing pictures of her husband and son in
near-identical playing poses. Both are wearing Bruins' black and
gold, both are pressed up against the post, father and son joined
in a profession, separated by some 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   There's no telling how the next few days and weeks will go.
Tallas isn't sure if he's starting, but thinks he is, based on the
vibes head coach Pat Burns has been sending his way. Grahame
assumes Tallas will get the go for Game 1. Most likely, Burns will
go with Tallas, assess the results, factor the future from there.
It could be, Burns said earlier this week, that after 10 games
Tallas and Grahame will have made an equal number of starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big individual, covers a lot of net,'' said Burns, who
sees similarities between the 6-foot-2-inch Grahame and the 6-4
Daren Puppa, dating back to Puppa's more successful days in
Buffalo. ``He seems to be much more calm and cool than when he
first got here.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of that confidence has come from Grahame's work the last
two years with former Boston goalie Ross Brooks, the goalie
consultant in Providence, and Gerry Cheevers, now one of the club's
top scouts and part-time TV color man.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much that they've worked with my style,'' said
Grahame, ``as they have just with the way I think about the game.
They've given me a lot of pointers, to be thinking about the next
shot and what you might do with it. Both of them have been really
good about it.''
</P>
<P>
   A new season is upon the Bruins. Any day now, John Grahame
probably will get to stand in that 4-by-6-foot rectangular cage
and, in his own way, play out his family's circle of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at that sometimes,'' said John, thinking of the framed
pictures that have he and his father in mirror image, ``and it just
gives me a chill.''

MORE THAN EVER, STAR GOALIES ARE FRANCHISE SAVIORS

<P>
   The great ones have usually had nicknames that connote
impermeability or goose eggs. The China Wall. Tony O. The
Dominator. Mr. Zero.
</P>
<P>
   The goaltender has always been the keystone of his hockey team.
The gardien. The denier, the time-buyer, the last stop before the
red light. ``The goalie has always played the most important
position in hockey,'' says Toronto general manager Ken Dryden, who
backstopped Montreal to six Stanley Cups in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   And in today's parity-swollen National Hockey League, he's more
important than ever _ and he's finally being paid that way. Three
of the NHL's top 11 wage-earners are goalies (Colorado's Patrick
Roy, Buffalo's Dominik Hasek, and Toronto's Curtis Joseph) and all
of them are pulling down more than $6 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goalies are like Pedro,'' says Carolina general manager Jim
Rutherford, whose club rode Arturs Irbe into the playoffs last
season for the first time in seven years. ``That's how important
they are.''
</P>
<P>
   A great goalie can make an expansion team semi-respectable, or
at least hold down the score to single digits. A great goalie can
get a mediocre team a round or two deep into the playoffs. A great
goalie can take a good team to a string of Cups, as Turk Broda did
for Toronto in the '40s, as Jacques Plante did for Montreal in the
'50s, as Johnny Bower did for Toronto in the '60s and as Billy
Smith did for the Islanders and Grant Fuhr did for Edmonton in the
'80s.
</P>
<P>
   And a weak goalie gets hung with a nickname that follows him
into the record books _ Andre `Red Light' Racicot, Howard `Holes'
Lockhart (who played for the Bruins in 1924-25), and Steve `The
Puck Goes Inski' Buzinski.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goaltender is important by definition, just by the
position he plays,'' says Dryden. ``If you're a forward or a
defenseman, you need to be a star or a player having a star game to
have a big impact on a game. But you can be an average goalie
having an average game and you're going to be important.''
</P>
<P>
   In no other sport does one player have as much control over the
outcome as does the hockey goaltender. The football quarterback
plays only half of the time and needs a decent offensive line to
keep him from being smothered. The baseball pitcher can baffle and
thwart an entire batting order but he only works every fourth day.
</P>
<P>
   The goalie can play 60 minutes a night for 80 nights for 20
years. You can put him between the pipes and build your whole
system around him. ``A great goalie gives you a chance to win every
night,'' says Rutherford, whose Hurricanes pushed the Bruins to six
games in last season's playoffs and meet them in Saturday night's
opener at the FleetCenter. ``Our team knows that with Irbe in there
we can play in a 0-0 game right until the end and still win it with
one shot.''
</P>
<P>
   With the league ballooned to 28 teams (and next year, 30) from
the original six, talent spread widely, and economics keeping
rosters fluid, a top-level goaltender can make up for plenty of
variables.
</P>
<P>
   He can plug a leaky defense like the mythical Dutch boy with his
finger in the dike. He can frustrate star forwards beyond belief.
(Phil Esposito called the rookie Dryden ``a bleeping octopus.'')
And he can allow his forwards to linger in the attacking zone
instead of doubling back to protect him. ``The goalie is that
equalizer,'' says Dryden. ``He allows you wings.''
</P>
<P>
   And if he's having a magical season, a gifted goalie can set his
team soaring to unexpected heights. Olaf Kolzig took Washington
from nowhere to its first Cup final two seasons ago. Irbe, playing
for a San Jose team that had won 11 games the previous year, beat
heavily favored Detroit and pushed Toronto to seven games in 1994.
And Hasek took Buffalo to its first Cup final this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Former Montreal GM) Sam Pollock used to say that the
goaltender is 70 percent of the team,'' says Dryden. ``But even
when you have Hasek as the league's most dominant player and the
MVP, he's still not the highest-paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh wing Jaromir Jagr (at $10.4 million) is. The top six
on the list are all goal scorers _ Anaheim's Paul Kariya,
Colorado's Peter Forsberg, the New York Rangers' Theoren Fleury,
Philadelphia's Eric Lindros, and Florida's Pavel Bure. But goalies
are climbing briskly up the ladder, and they're still paid more on
average than forwards and defensemen.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the price for a franchise 'tender who can get you a
champagne-filled Cup has risen steeply in recent years. Roy, who
won two with Montreal and a third with Colorado three years ago,
now commands more than $7 million. ``It's obvious that if you don't
have a premier goaltender, you're not going to make the final,''
says agent Steve Freyer.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven netminders now earn at least $3 million, 19 earn at least
$2 million, and 30 make at least $1 million. And as the prices go
up, the NHL has gone back to the day of the ironman, when one
goaltender got all the work.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the '20s, no team carried more than one. When Lorne
Chabot took a puck in the eye in the 1928 Cup final, the Rangers
had to suit up Lester Patrick, their 44-year-old coach-GM, against
the Montreal Maroons. In 1956-57, when the position was played
without facemasks, three of the league's six goalies played all 70
games. And Glenn ``Mr. Goalie'' Hall played 502 consecutive games
for the Red Wings and Blackhawks between 1955-1962.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one time goalies played every game,'' says Dryden, who
averaged only 50 during his eight years with the Canadiens. ``Then
they worked their way back to two-thirds of the season. Now, it's
probably five-sixths.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, 17 goalies played more than 60 games and four (New
Jersey's Martin Brodeur, Anaheim's Guy Hebert, Boston's Byron
Dafoe, and Toronto's Joseph) logged more than 4,000 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The increased workload has more to do with economics, though,
than it does stamina. ``If you're going to pay your goaltender as
much as you're paying him now, he'd better earn it,'' says
Rutherford. ``He can't just be playing 50 games.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the going rate for a starter these days is at least $2
million, clubs can't afford to have a two-man rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't afford it to pay two guys that way now with your
salary structure,'' says Rutherford.
</P>
<P>
   So most clubs have a predictable ``crease hierarchy'' with a
decided dropoff behind The Man. ``You have a highly-paid top
goalie, a modestly-paid semi-veteran journeyman goalie and you're
developing a younger goalie in the minors,'' says Dryden. ``And you
hope that if your top goalie goes down, your younger goalie isn't
too far from being ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The top netminder usually represents a huge investment, more in
time than in cash. Despite their importance, no goalie has ever
been taken first overall in the NHL draft. That's because few can
have the immediate impact of a Gretzky or an Orr and because
goalies can be maddeningly difficult to identify at the junior
level.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to evaluate an 18-year-old in anything,''
muses Dryden, ``and it's that much harder with a goalie.''
</P>
<P>
   A handful of neophyte 'tenders have made immediate splashes in
the NHL. Roy won the Cup with the Canadiens when he was 20. And Tom
Barrasso went directly from Acton-Boxboro HS to the Sabres in 1983
and is still playing.
</P>
<P>
   But most are in their early 20s before they make their league
debut. ``It took me about three full seasons before I was convinced
I should be in the league,'' says Rutherford, who played 13 seasons
for four clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Tending goal in the NHL requires an extended apprenticeship and
an ability to adapt to who's playing (or isn't playing) in front of
you. There are ``good team'' goalies and ``bad team'' goalies and
they require different skills.
</P>
<P>
   But once they're in the league, whether they're with good teams
or bad, the great ones tend to stick around long enough to get a
gold watch. Sawchuk and Gump Worsley each played for 21 years, Hall
and Plante and Smith for 18. Hasek, Roy, Joseph, and Dallas's Ed
Belfour are all in their 30s and still bedrock players.
</P>
<P>
   Though the NHL has changed dramatically since Georges Vezina
played for Les Habitants in 1917 (and led the league with a 4.0
goals-against average), the essence of the game has not. There is
still a goal at each end of the rink with one man, be he The China
Wall or sieve, who can play 60 minutes for 80 games. The puck still
stops there.

TENNESSEE FOCUS OF NO. 1 CONCERN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUHN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when college football seems to be putting its best foot
forward _ with exciting, competitive games between top teams, such
as Georgia Tech-Florida State, Penn State-Miami, and
Florida-Tennessee _ we find ourselves reading about another
academic fraud scandal.
</P>
<P>
   This one involves Tennessee, the defending national champion.
The charges are not new: that tutors either went to class for
football players or took tests and wrote papers for them.
</P>
<P>
   What do you do in such a situation? Shrug and blame the system
of big-time athletics? Roll your eyes and say, ``Who cares? Tell us
about what kind of year Tee Martin and Jamal Lewis are having''? Or
do you get on a soap box and talk about the pond scum that college
athletics has become and argue that it is totally out of control
and should be deemphasized?
</P>
<P>
   There are no simple answers. Depending on your agenda, any of
these reactions may seem approrpiate.
</P>
<P>
   What is disturbing here is the pattern. Miami wins a national
championship in 1991, and the 'Canes soon find themselves on
probation. Alabama wins a national championship in 1992, and the
Tide is hit by probation. Now Tennessee wins the national
championship and the allegations surface, with enough documentation
to make the people in Knoxville nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, some people in Tennessee think this is part of an
ESPN conspiracy _ ESPN.com broke the story _ since many felt ESPN
had led a campaign that kept the Heisman Trophy away from Peyton
Manning two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, is nonsense. Reporters follow stories, paper
trails, and tales of misdeed, just as they simply report on Heisman
and national championship races.
</P>
<P>
   The misconception among the public seems to be that the role of
the media is to promote teams and players. Write only positive
stories, and don't look when you see something bad.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry. It doesn't work that way. No one in Tennessee complained
about all the positive stuff coverage from Knoxville as the Vols
won a national championship.
</P>
<P>
   The spotlight works both ways. It shows the good things about a
program and its people, and it illuminates the flaws.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee clearly has made some mistakes. Where this will all
leads is anyone's guess. We could have more dirt dug up, and see
another national champion face the not-so-gentle hammer of an NCAA
investigation and probation.
</P>
<P>
   The one good thing for Tennessee is that the national
championship can't be taken away no matter what happens because the
NCAA doesn't actually award a Division 1-A football championship.
Champions are decided in polls following bowl games, not by an NCAA
championship tournament.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Tide of history
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Alabama's 35-28 win over Arkansas last week prevented a historic
happening. Had the Hogs won, they would have been only the second
team in history to beat the Tide three straight times in
Tuscaloosa. Only Sewanne, which did it during the period from
1896-1911, had shown such dominance in Alabama . . . Conference USA
is strutting these days. With East Carolina's win over Miami last
week, C-USA had its second upset of a Top 10 team in September. The
other was Cincinnati's upset of Wisconsin two weeks ago . . . East
Carolina is 4-0, its best start since 1976 . . . Penn State is 5-0,
the sixth time the Lions have started that well in the 1990s and
the 14th time they have done it in Joe Paterno's tenure . . . Miami
of Ohio meets Marshall Saturday in a game that features two players
worthy of at least consideration for the Heisman, Miami running
back Travis Prentics and Marshall quarterback Chad Pennington. Not
bad for the Mid-American Conference . . . Alabama, a 17-point
underdog to Florida Saturday, tried to prepare for the noise at
Florida Field by practicing indoors and setting up speakers blaring
crowd noise . . . Division 3 power Mount Union is closing in one of
college football's most enduring records: Oklahoma's 47-game
winning streak from 1953-57. The Purple Raiders have won 45
straight . . . The Atlantic 10 appears to be putting pressure on
Virignia Tech to make its move to the Big East a year sooner than
the Hokies or the Big East expected. Right now, the plans call for
Tech to become a full member of the Big East in July 2001. But the
A-10, which may have its eyes on Delaware, wants to move the
timetable up . . . Movement continues under foot to bring back
Boston Univeristy football, but as long as John Silber is calling
the shots, those possibilities seem slim. It is interesting to
note, however, that the total budget for athlteics at BU is
approximately $2.4 million, while Chancellor Silber, Law School
dean Ronald Cass, and Surgery Department chairman James Becker had
a combined earnings of $1.6 million. Obviously, money is not a
problem at BU with those kind of packages for three people. But the
ongoing problem of Title IX compliance is a concern at BU, which
has a 58 percent-to-42 percent female-to-male enrollment and must
have its sports funded accordingly . . . Lou Holtz is having a
tough first year at South Carolina. Not only are his Gamecocks off
to an 0-4 start, but Holtz's wife, Beth, is dealing with a
recurring case of throat cancer. ``Mrs. Holtz's attitude is better
than mine,'' said Holtz, who took off in the middle of the week to
fly to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., where doctors are
poondering how to treat the tumors that have appeared in Beth
Holtz's adrenal glands. Major surgery is scheduled, and the burden
on Holtz increases, although the coach said the prognosis for his
wife's recovery is good. On the football side, South Carolina has
lost 14 straight, the longest slide in 1-A football. Added to the
burden was the severe abdominal infection suffered by Holtz's son
Skip, the Gamecocks' offensive coordiantor. It's been a tough fall
in Columbia . . . One of the success stories of the season thus far
is East Carolina. Not only are the Pirates 4-0 after their stunning
27-23 upset of Miami last week, but they are still dealing with the
aftermath of the damage caused by hurricanes Dennis and Floyd,
after which the campus in Greenville, N.C., was closed because of
floods and torrential rains . . . Signs of programs in trouble.
LSU, South Carolina, and Auburn all will play Saturday with
quarterbacks making their first career starts. LSU's Josh Booty
will find the going tough against Georgia on the road, while
Auburn's Jeff Klein will have to deal with Tennessee and South
Carolina's Goodman will face Ole Miss . . . The SEC has six of the
top 20 rushing defenses in college football, led by Ole Miss's No.
6 ranking . . . Syracuse has a QB ``controversy,'' with coach Paul
Pasqualoni playing both Troy Nunes and Madei Williams. When asked
if he was going to ``resolve'' the issue, Pasqualoni said, ``No.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Jay Wilkins and Marc Lind each had just 60
seconds _ the time it takes to ride an elevator down a dozen floors
in an office building _ to describe their Internet start-up
companies, the market opportunities for them, and why they will
prosper.
</P>
<P>
   Using a technique dubbed ``elevator pitches'' to win over
potential multimillion-dollar investors, Wilkins scored well with
his quick description of Boatscape.com, an on-line brokerage that
matches buyers and sellers of power boats, sailboats, and other
nautical products.
</P>
<P>
   But Lind got mixed reviews for his pitch for his electronic
commerce firm that caters to a segment of the wholesale auto parts
market, InventoryAuction.com, despite his catchy description of his
venture as ``eBay on steroids.''
</P>
<P>
   Both, however, considered their efforts a success: After they
were finished, each was approached by venture capitalists and other
investors who wanted to learn more.
</P>
<P>
   Their presentations were part of a two-day financial bazaar
called Venture Market East sponsored by Red Herring magazine late
in September. The overflow crowd attracted a range of entrepreneurs
(a few wrote ``seeking $$$'' on their name tags), alongside private
and corporate investors looking for opportunities. Circulating
among them all were accountants, consultants, and lawyers looking
for business.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the pattern at similar show-and-tell sessions where
dreamers on both sides of the balance sheet come together to do
deals, Wilkins, Lind, and 48 other entrepreneurs were picked from
more than 300 Massachusetts- and New York-based start-ups, mostly
Internet and telecommunications companies, by the editors of Red
Herring, a San Francisco-based monthly devoted to high-tech
business trends.
</P>
<P>
   Each company had an opportunity to spend up to 15 minutes
showing and telling their stories in slides and words. But in
addition, Lind and Wilkins were among the seven founders of
fledgling companies who agreed to participate in a separate
presentation forum where each had just 60 seconds to encapsulate
why their company was worth investing in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elevator pitches'' represent a generic concept that harkens
back to when struggling sales people had to talk fast and
coherently to sell the boss on an idea or a new product on a ride
to or from an office, and be done before the doors opened. It is
the print version of today's audio sound bite.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the leading venture capitalists are receiving
more than a dozen Internet business plans per month, finding the
most promising ones _ the verbal snapshots that convey enough
passion and determination to prompt a later, more formal meeting _
can take more time than many investors are willing to give.
</P>
<P>
   Lind, of InventoryAuction.com, described his company's auto
parts auction service as ``eBay on steroids'' as a way to
demonstrate its role in the business-to-business market niche.
</P>
<P>
   He said 3 to 7 percent of the $100 billion auto parts business
consists of excess, overproduction, or surplus inventories that
often sit on shelves unsold or are later liquidated at a loss.
Using the World Wide Web to match new-car parts manufacturers with
distributors, Lind said InventoryAuction.com was formed in late
1998 to provide free parts listings. It collects fees based on the
completed transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I practiced this pitch when I exercised,'' said Lind just
before he gave it as part of his quest for $3 million to $6 million
in funding to further develop his company. While fast-paced, his
spiel still is conversational, nothing like the machine-gun
approach one might imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for Diane Hardison, marketing director of the Fairfax
County, Va., Economic Development Authority, Lind's elevator pitch
did not resonate well.
</P>
<P>
   ``After saying his company was the `eBay on steroids,' he just
didn't say why it was unique or why anyone should be head over
heels for this idea,'' she said, adding that Lind's subsequent
15-minute presentation enabled her to better understand the
company.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Lind said his dual approach at the Red Herring
conference won him some investor leads, and he hopes he can launch
the company's Web site early next year.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, other investor-listeners considered Wilkins's pitch
for Boatscape.com, which has three competitors, easier to grasp.
``Where boaters click,'' is how he described his auction site for
the recreational boating community, which will charge no more than
$100 to both list and sell a boat.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few days before making his elevator pitch on Tuesday,
Wilkins had won a commitment from (at)Ventures, the venture capital
arm of CMGI Inc. of Andover, to provide $5 million in first-round
funding. Still, his 11-person Boston-based company, which Wilkins
has largely financed, needed to reach other investors for
subsequent financing.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins, a former Army helicopter pilot and Harvard Business
School graduate who left Boston Consulting Group to launch
Boatscape.com earlier this year, recalled how he practiced his
pitch: ``I walked around the Newton Centre parking lot about a
dozen times with my wife Vanessa timing me and giving me
suggestions about which words to say and not say.''
</P>
<P>
   It must have worked, because several attendees said Wilkins's
determination came across well in his 60-second presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Brenda Chin Hsu, founder and president of
seven-year-old Buyersone.com of Cambridge, received high marks for
quickly explaining how her company serves the small business
community in automating the purchase of office equipment,
technology supplies, and services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The elevator pitch makes a great way for us to describe our
value proposition in a minute,'' said Hsu. ``For us, having the
investment community enabled us to gain exposure for a second-round
financing and explore some business development opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   evator-pitch sessions were sandwiched among the 15-minute
sessions that often drew standing-room-only crowds to hear about a
panoply of businesses. They range from a Web-based communication
service (MessageBlaster.com) that simultaneously distributes
messages via phone, fax, e-mail, or postal mail, to developers of
sophisticated optical telecommunications equipment companies (Tenor
Networks and Astral Point Communications).
</P>
<P>
   In this year's overheated Internet-oriented investment climate,
it is just a guessing game how many of these companies will be
around in five years. So Red Herring points to its biggest success,
Nexabit Networks Inc. of Marlborough, which participated in last
year's Venture East conference. In late June of this year, Lucent
Technologies Inc. announced it was acquiring Nexabit for $900
million in stock.

THE END OF AN IRA? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There are three former chairmen who still keep an
office at BankBoston's downtown headquarters. Now, with Fleet
Financial's takeover of the bank finally a done deal Friday, one is
going. Guess who?
</P>
<P>
   Ira Stepanian hasn't been a gracious loser since he was ousted
in favor of Chad Gifford in 1995. From pointed remarks from the
audience at annual meetings to newspaper opinion columns, Stepanian
has questioned the process that cost him his job and the deal to
sell the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is payback time.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Murray, Fleet's chief executive, and Gifford made the
decision to dump Stepanian. In a letter from the human resources
department, Stepanian was told he would lose his office at 100
Federal St. because the bank has no intention of paying for space
for someone who is not with the program. Two other former chairmen,
Dick Hill and Bill Brown, are staying.
</P>
<P>
   But Stepanian, if he goes, is not going quietly. He suggests
not-so-subtly that if the bank reneges on what he says is an
agreement to provide him an office, ``then all bets are off.'' This
is a man who knows where the bodies are buried.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't have to meet their obligations, then I don't
have to meet mine,'' Stepanian told me Thursday. He adds: ``I was
at the bank today; I plan to go tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepanian is a guy I like. His is a terrific against-the-odds
story of an Armenian kid from Somerville who rose to run the most
Brahmin of Boston banks. He was a good banker who helped bring
BankBoston back from a close encounter with death in the early '90s
and helped set it on a roll. No one ever questioned his integrity
or that he cared about his bank or his city. He has one incredibly
loyal wife, no small accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   But, simply put, Stepanian has been out of bounds in his
behavior since he was fired. It's not what he's said, but that he's
been waging a campaign against his successor while sitting on the
28th floor of the bank. It's too much to expect the fort commander
to allow you to line up your cannons inside the walls.
</P>
<P>
   This is very, very personal with Stepanian. He was fired, in
part, because he didn't deliver a merger partner to the board. But
he believes Gifford, his second-in-command, was undermining him all
along, arguing against a potential deal with BayBanks and then
going to board members to complain his boss couldn't do a deal. The
board eventually chose Gifford over Stepanian.
</P>
<P>
   How personal is it? Just before Stepanian was fired, the Rev.
Charles Stith, who then ran the Organization for a New Equality,
had decided to honor Stepanian as man of the year. After Stepanian
was fired, everyone decided to go ahead with the tribute. Gifford
was to give the toast at Copley Place. But Stepanian's wife,
Jackie, went to Gifford and told him that if he uttered a word,
she'd walk out. Gifford never got up that night and neither did
Jackie.
</P>
<P>
   Stepanian's severance agreement limits what he can say, but he
has found plenty of ways to make his feelings known. Moving on is
not among his strengths.
</P>
<P>
   Stepanian was nothing short of infuriated by a story I wrote
four years ago that detailed the board decision to fire him. To him
it was an unpardonable ethical lapse by a board member, and he has
never tired of trying to uncover the source. In a highly unusual
move, Stepanian tried to have the board publicly polled to uncover
the leaker at one annual meeting. The bank said no.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of the bank sat no better with him. In two Globe
opinion pieces, he questioned the deal's timing and price Gifford
got for shareholders. His nastiest remarks were reserved for
Gifford and his compensation package: ``By accepting a package of
guarantees, which is counter to BankBoston's own philosophy of
being paid for performance, BankBoston's CEO has obtained for
himself what he, in principle, had wanted in earlier talks with
another bank _ a package to retire with.''

<P>
   Sour grapes or was Stepanian saying what he believed? Or both? I
can't get inside Stepanian's head. Certainly there is nothing wrong
with him saying what he thinks. In fact, it is refreshing,
considering a corporate culture that dictates that a fired
executive should take the money and keep his mouth shut.
</P>
<P>
   But you do it outside the bank, not inside. A question: Would
Ira have tolerated an Ira firing from within? Would anyone?

MFS MANAGER RISES TO THE OCCASION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's one thing to replace the manager of a mutual fund that has
gone to the dogs. It's quite another to take the seat of a very
visible manager who has been doing well by his customers.
</P>
<P>
   Maura Shaughnessy found herself in the second category a little
over seven months ago, when she moved beyond the decidedly lower
profile world of utility stock investing to add the management of
MFS Capital Opportunities to her duties. So far, so good and then
some.
</P>
<P>
   MFS Investment Management of Boston had been in a spot in
February, when well-known money managers Chris Felipe and John
Brennan quit to start their own investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   MFS had a roster of strong funds and was pulling in money from
customers at a record pace. Felipe and Brennan were by no means the
entire draw, but they were important players. The challenge: Don't
fall off the track.
</P>
<P>
   The company decided to advance relative unknowns: Shaughnessy to
replace Brennan at MFS Capital Opportunities and Stephen Pesek to
take over the largest of the funds, Felipe's Massachusetts
Investors Growth. Pesek and analyst Irfan Ali took over MFS
Strategic Growth.
</P>
<P>
   Pesek has had his ups and downs, but Massachusetts Investors
Growth has now edged slightly ahead of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index since Feb. 24. MFS Strategic Growth has doubled the S&AMP;P 500,
after a slow start.
</P>
<P>
   But the performance of Shaughnessy's fund is the most
intriguing, nearly tripling the same S&AMP;P 500 index with a return of
9.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Her style is a little different, spreading the fund's $2.6
billion among more stocks to dilute a bit of its investment
concentration and avoiding the marketing-timing plays that
sometimes crept into the portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Marketwide put options were eliminated. The fund's largest
position, which amounted to about 12 percent of assets, was cut to
half that slice. Another 20 or 30 stocks, ``my bench'' as
Shaughnessy calls them, were added to the roster.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the brokers who sell MFS funds aren't complaining that
they have to sell a new investment story.
</P>
<P>
   ``When and if I start screwing up, we might have that
conversation,'' she said. ``But I don't think they're having a
problem with what we're doing right now, to be a little obnoxious
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   We said she was relatively unknown, not unconfident.
</P>
<P>
   Shaughnessy said her first job out of college, working as a
research assistant at the Federal Reserve in Washington, convinced
her it was a waste of time trying to anticipate when economies and
stock markets would turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a portfolio manager who is supposed to be picking stocks,
why would I spend a second of my day trying tp make some macro
forecast?'' she said. ``I think it's an impossible thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the stocks that have made money for Shaughnessy are
technology names, especially in the telecommunications industry.
She has bought stocks like Motorola Inc., General Instrument Corp.,
Texas Instruments Inc., and Analog Devices Inc. and held on to most
of the wireless communication companies already in the portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   But she said the industries that don't show up in her fund have
more to do with its strong relative performance. Industries that
have suffered through a terrible 1999 stock market, like health
care and financial services, are largely absent with the exception
of a few insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things you don't own are infinitely more important than
the things you do own,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Don't bother asking Shaughnessy where she thinks the market is
headed: You'll get a ``who knows'' answer. But she remains upbeat
about the work she actually does, picking stocks and passing on
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about finding relative value in the market and
there's plenty of them right now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Make those lawsuits go away!
</P>
<P>
   How many CEOs have shouted that in frustration? Now Inso Corp.
has actually found someone else to take the heat in a slew of
shareholder suits filed against the Boston software company over
restated financial results. For a price.
</P>
<P>
   Inso said Thursday that an AAA-rated insurance company agreed to
assume all financial responsibility for the defense and ultimate
resolution of the consolidated case.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to take a charge of $14 million to wash its
hands of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   People who sell these polices call them ``loss mitigation
products.'' Everybody else calls it ``burning building insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the name, Boston securities lawyers like Tom Shapiro,
the lead attorney in the Inso case, and Glen DeValerio, a
plaintiffs committee member in the case, say it is a fast-growing
trend among companies that are sued by their shareholders.

FANS SEE PROGRESS IN KATZENMOYER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Andy Katzenmoyer jerseys are selling fast at
the Patriots Pro Shop at Foxboro Stadium. Employees say shirts with
Katzenmoyer's No. 59 are approaching those with Drew Bledsoe's No.
11 in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously there's a vast difference in each players'
accomplishments, but there's something about ``The Big Cat'' that
Patriots fans have grown to like.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very flattering,'' said Katzenmoyer. ``It's extremely
flattering. I don't know what to say. It's great when a kid is
wearing your jersey. They sold jerseys at Ohio State, but it was
three numbers and a majority of them were `45' jerseys (the number
Katzenmoyer wore). You'd walk into the stands and see `45' jersies.
It's great to see people get involved. I didn't mind it at all. You
have to be excited and enthusiastic about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenmoyer's play has begun to approach the expectations that
came with being a first-round draft pick, though he needs many more
games and much more experience to reach the level he and the
coaching staff expect.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this week's visit to his home state of Ohio, where the
Patriots meet the Cleveland Browns Sunday, will bring out the best
of him. For sure, Katzenmoyer will have friends and family
attending the game, just like the old days at Ohio State in
Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenmoyer grew up in Westerville, Ohio, a northern suburb of
Columbus and was a _ sorry Cleveland _ Cincinnati Bengals' fan
because his dad was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no clue why,'' said Katzenmoyer. ``He was always a
Bengal fan so I was. I just remember liking guys like Icky Woods
and James Brooks and Boomer Esiason. I remember the year they went
to the Super Bowl, but I wasn't completely into them like some fans
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenmoyer said most football fans in Westerville root for the
Browns. ``It's probably 60-40, maybe now it's 65-35 Browns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hate the Browns,'' he said. ``I just liked the
Bengals. Nothing against the Browns.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenmoyer is pretty excited about seeing the new stadium in
Cleveland and playing in his home state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get to see friends and family,'' he said. ``I'm excited that
the people are close by and get to watch me play. I like that. It's
not a thing where it's a big boost for me, but it's just nice for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenmoyer wishes he could speed up the learning process. But
he knows that isn't the case. When Tedy Bruschi said a few weeks
ago that Katzenmoyer needed to get up to speed and that he
``couldn't wait for him anymore,'' he did it as a motivational
tool, for Bruschi knows how long it takes to be a top-notch
linebacker in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was just Tedy,'' said Katzenmoyer. ``He's always like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenmoyer is starting to gain recognition of his work from the
coaching staff. Bo Pelini, a fellow Ohio State grad, has been in
charge of bringing Katzenmoyer along. ``Bo's an all-round good
guy,'' Katzenmoyer said. ``It doesn't matter where he's from. If he
came from Michigan, I'd think he was still the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Pete Carroll speaks of Katzenmoyer as if it's just a matter of
time before his 6-foot-3-inch, 255-pound linebacker will become a
player to be reckoned with. If it's not this year, then some time
some.
</P>
<P>
   ``His last game was his best game,'' said Carroll. ``He was much
more aggressive. He was much more assertive. He had some big hits.
The number of plays he had where he was out of position was very,
very few. I've been waiting for a good basic game, when we weren't
involved in a lot of spread offenses, and this was more of a rock
'em, sock' em game that really suited what we were looking from him
at this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had had two games prior to that where he was just fighting
for his life to stay alive and do well.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenmoyer made six tackles against the Giants last Sunday, but
he seemed more active than that. He is not yet the big force in the
middle that Ted Johnson (out for the season) had become, but he
isn't a pushover.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really all about the comfort level I feel,'' he said.
``I'm seeing more plays and schemes. The more I see, the better I'm
going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenmoyer already recognizes the difference between college
and the pros. ``In college, one week you'll see a team who runs the
option and the next week a team that uses five receivers. Because
there's a limited amount of practice time in college, what you see
is what you're going to get. There's no room to put in new wrinkles
like in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might see a different look at every play in the NFL. It's
making those adjustments on the run all the time that takes getting
used to. Someday, hopefully, it'll all be second nature to me and
I'll be able to recognize formations easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can be a lot better,'' Katzenmoyer said. ``I have to keep on
going and keep on improving. I still have a long way to go. It's
going to be a long road all season. I constantly have to work and
work.''
</P>
<P>
   But Katzenmoyer knows he is impatient. ``I want to be there now.
It's going to bother me until I'm there and to be honest, I don't
really think I'll ever be where I expect to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenmoyer admits it was difficult to switch from the weak side
linebacker spot he was playing through most of training camp to the
middle spot he had to fill after Johnson tore his right bicep
during an intrasquad game in August.
</P>
<P>
   Though he is familiar with the middle from his college days,
it's entirely different than the weak side spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough transition,'' he said. ``I didn't have time to
think about it, I just had to go out there and learn on the run.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Katzenmoyer has accepted his role and realizes he might be
playing the weakside spot again next season when Johnson returns to
the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm keeping an open mind,'' said Katzenmoyer. ``I'm
aware of what I'm doing wrong and I'm doing the best I can to
adjust. There's always something that you see on film that you can
be better at.''
</P>
<P>
   And no matter how many of his jerseys fans buy, Katzenmoyer
said, ``I won't feel comfortable in this room until I prove more to
myself as a player.''

GOP BREAKS VOW TO PASS SPENDING BUDGET ON TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the federal government rolls into a new budget
year this month, the Republicans who run Congress acknowledge they
have failed to make good on their promise to pass a spending plan
on time.
</P>
<P>
   And that is only one of the problems they are confronting.
</P>
<P>
   The party of tax cuts just watched President Clinton veto its
$792 billion give-back to taxpayers, and it seems to have litle
recourse. The party of less regulation may have to accept new
limits on HMOs, thanks to a revolt by Republican lawmakers. The
party of smaller government is on track to break an earlier promise
to keep federal spending under a predetermined level. It even
appears to be backing away from its traditional opposition to a
higher minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Now, even some friends of the congressional Republicans wonder
why the party in power seems so powerless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally am very disappointed in them, and I know many
other Republicans are also,'' said Diana Furchtgott-Roth, an
economist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, who
favors lower taxes, lower spending and no minimum wage hike. ``They
call me up and ask me to give money, and I say, `No way.' They are
a deep disappointment to anyone of principle.''
</P>
<P>
   To some, the latest disappointment is the budget process that is
grinding beyond the Oct. 1 start of the new fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   One sore point is that Congress appears to be on track to spend
more than it agreed to in the groundbreaking Balanced Budget Act of
1997, which paved the way for the current budget surpluses.
Moreover, House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert had promised that the
budget would be approved on time this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes them look especially farcical and hypocritical,''
said Stephen Moore, a fan of former GOP House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, who watches the budget process for the libertarian Cato
Institute. ``The Democrats not getting the budget done on time was
indicative of how corrupt they'd become in power. And now the
Republicans have fallen into the same pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers have approved only five of the 13 bills that make up
the federal budget, but Clinton has already vetoed one and
threatened to reject others. The budget battle may continue for
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   With the Massachusetts Legislature already three months late in
passing a state budget, the federal showdown broadens the cloud
hanging over programs that rely on government money. Federal
funding for a wide variety of local purposes is still under
negotiation _ money for university research and secondary schools,
to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening salvo in another battle, Senators Edward M.
Kennedy and Thomas Daschle, the Senate majority leader, said they
would introduce a bill to send $9 billion over 10 years to teaching
hospitals. Many of the hospitals claim they are losing money
because of payment cuts that Congress approved two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The money is part of $20 billion that Daschle and Kennedy would
send to a range of health-care providers. Separately, Kennedy said
he is working to give an additional $950 million through 2003 to
the nation's 46 children's hospitals to help cover the cost of
training pediatricians.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 20 years, lawmakers have passed the full budget on
time on only three occasions. Following past practice, Congress has
already passed a stopgap measure to keep the government running for
three weeks while lawmakers continue working. The president signed
that measure Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the Republicans suffered a public relations disaster
when Gingrich shut down most government operations rather than
negotiate a budget deal with Clinton. Rather than spark public
anger over another shutdown, many analysts say, the Republicans are
likely to give Clinton much of what he wants. That happened last
year, when Republicans agreed to Clinton's late request for
additional education spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, the Republicans will be bested'' by Clinton, said
Alfonse D'Amato, the former Republican senator from New York. ``We
come in with calls to cut education, to cut one popular program
after another. When the economy is booming, people don't want to
hear that you're cutting education. Our doctrinaire rhetoric traps
Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, two broad factors are coloring the budget
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   First is the new era of budget surpluses, estimated to reach
$147 billion next year from Social Security payroll taxes and about
$15 billion from other sources. At first blush, the surplus might
seem to make budgeting easier than in the era of budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1997 deal that produced that surplus requires Congress
to keep spending under tight caps. To stick to the caps, Republican
budget-writers have adopted such tactics as reclaiming $3 billion
in welfare money already promised to the states. They have also
designated some expenses for the next census as ``emergency
spending.'' Emergency spending is not counted against the budget
caps.
</P>
<P>
   A second factor dominating the budget talks is a familiar one:
Both sides are angling for a sound-bite to use during the next
campaign season.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans not only say they will stick to the budget caps, but
they also make a point of saying that all money raised by Social
Security taxes will be reserved only for the national retirement
program. House Republicans, in fact, have prepared television
commercials protesting a Democratic ``raid'' on the Social Security
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are also positioning themselves as the protectors of
Social Security, arguing that the Republicans' tax cut bill that
Clinton vetoed would have stripped Social Security of required
funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're really trying to position themselves for the campaign
cycle rather than for substance. Both sides,'' said Patrick Burns,
communications director for the National Council of Senior
Citizens.

FILINGS SAY BROKER BILKED CLIENTS OF $6 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In the dead of night on Aug. 17, 1998, John Macoul, a
trial lawyer in Salem, N.H., was startled awake by his bedside
phone. Struggling out of a deep sleep, he didn't recognize at first
the voice of his brother-in-law, Donald Martineau, a veteran broker
at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need you,'' the voice whispered tensely. ``Everything's
coming apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Unnerved, Macoul went to his office shortly after dawn the next
morning as his brother-in-law requested. On the stoop outside the
door was a plastic garbage bag filled with financial documents and
a note that read, ``I have made some very serious mistakes, and the
moment of truth is almost here.''
</P>
<P>
   That night, police found Martineau on a deserted New Hampshire
roadside slumped unconscious over the steering wheel of his crashed
Oldsmobile Cutlass. An empty bottle of Jack Daniel's and a loaded
.25-caliber handgun were on the seat next to him, according to
police reports. The broker, roused momentarily by the officers,
mumbled groggily, ``Shoot me. Just shoot me.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, more than a year later, Merrill Lynch says that the
broker over the course of nearly a decade systematically bilked $6
million from clients who included his closest friends and family.
Many of them are now lining up in court in desperate attempts to
recover their money _ which Martineau claims no longer to have. And
Merrill Lynch, stuck with paying back some of the clients, is left
to explain how one of its own brokers could have evaded detection
for so long.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some clients now question whether the firm ignored
warning signs that something was amiss. Merrill Lynch officials
said the firm did nothing wrong, that Martineau's scam involved
fake investments unrelated to the firm and that he failed to
disclose the investments to the firm, as company policy and federal
rules require. But industry experts say brokerages like Merrill
Lynch should make every effort to know about all investment
activities of their brokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the responsibility of the supervisor to know what's going
on with each account,'' said Norman Padgett of Florida-based NL
Padgett Consultants, which advises brokerages. ``A firm has to have
procedures in place that could reasonably be expected to catch that
kind of violation, even when it's going on outside the office.''
</P>
<P>
   Martineau, 56, hasn't been charged with any crimes, but the US
Securities and Exchange Commission and federal prosecutors are
conducting investigations that are ``expected to culminate in a
criminal prosecution,'' according to court documents filed in
connection with a civil lawsuit against the broker.
</P>
<P>
   He continues to live with his wife in their large Colonial home
in an upscale section of Tewksbury, but he has claimed in court
papers that he is otherwise broke. He has filed for personal
bankruptcy protection and applied for Social Security benefits,
according to court filings.
</P>
<P>
   Martineau declined to be interviewed. But the story that emerges
from court filings, former clients, and the broker's own notes is a
tale of greed and desperation in which Martineau, a former history
professor, baldly deceived those around him, apparently to feed a
secret dream of success and wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like he lived a double life,'' said Macoul, the
brother-in-law, who says Martineau took $245,000 that he invested
through the broker. ``This was the guy I spent holidays with. He's
the godfather of my child. When I found out I was one of the
victims, it was surreal. It was like a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Martineau became an investment adviser after starting his career
teaching history at Boston College and the University of Louisville
in Kentucky, family members said. He made a comfortable living but
``always liked nice things,'' one said.
</P>
<P>
   He moved back to his home state of Massachusetts and joined
Merrill Lynch in 1979. For eight years, he built a stable of
customers. His investment advice, said former clients, had been
reliable. In terms of the income he generated through commissions,
he performed well but ``certainly wasn't one of our stars,'' said
Bill Halldin, a Merrill Lynch spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly, in 1987, ``all this started,'' according to a
handwritten note Martineau addressed to family and friends. The
note contained references to investment losses and a trading
account he maintained in his wife's name at a California investment
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have lost a lot of money trying to make money to get me out
of investment losses I couldn't handle,'' the note reads. ``I lost
a lot of money in options and continued like a fool to try and win
it back.'' Options are a risky and complex form of investing,
usually not undertaken by individuals.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, Martineau began advising a few of his clients to
invest heavily in a venture he controlled called D &AMP; D Real Estate,
which he claimed made short-term loans to options traders and
guaranteed an annual return of 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One such client, Hans G. Viezens of Woburn, invested the bulk of
his life savings after Martineau invited Viezens to his Merrill
Lynch office in downtown Boston, according to a lawsuit Viezens
filed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martineau described an `offer' that Martineau said he made
only to `his most trusted clients,' '' the lawsuit says. Viezens
invested $250,000 initially and then made several additional
investments for a total of $800,000. He got some of that money back
when he requested funds from the account. But the rest is gone, he
claims in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   D &AMP; D Real Estate, whose address is a leased post office box in
North Andover, turned out to be ``nothing more than a pyramid
scheme,'' the lawsuit says. A Merrill Lynch manager explained to
Viezens after the losses had been discovered and the firm conducted
its own investigation that D &AMP; D Real Estate never invested any
money. Instead, Martineau used the cash to pay ``personal
obligations,'' the suit claims the manager said.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few of Martineau's many clients made serious, ongoing
investments in D &AMP; D Real Estate, but those who did poured hundreds
of thousands of dollars into the scheme believing they were getting
high rates of return, Merrill Lynch officials said.
</P>
<P>
   When a particular client's investments came due, Martineau
apparently solicited additional investments from others in order to
come up with the cash, the lawsuits charge. In some cases,
Martineau told investors not to talk to anyone at Merrill Lynch
about the venture, which may have been a way to avoid arousing
suspicions within the firm, Merrill Lynch officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know about it, and there is no way we could have
known about it,'' Halldin said.
</P>
<P>
   That scheme resulted in the bulk of Martineau's client losses,
Merrill Lynch officials said. But as the years went on, his
deceptions became bolder. In a few cases, he told investors he was
putting their money into Merrill Lynch-backed investments when in
fact he was transferring the money to an account he controlled,
according to the records he left with his brother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Martineau said in his notes that he forged some clients'
signatures on wire transfer documents. In other cases, he said he
typed up documents that led his clients to believe he was moving
money into safe investments and then transferred the signature to a
document authorizing him to put the money in an account he
controlled. Merrill Lynch officials said those instances were rare.
</P>
<P>
   In Macoul's case, the money was simply gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just stunned,'' Macoul said. ``Here I am, his
brother-in-law. I don't even know what to think about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Martineau was often seen making long calls from a pay
phone in the lobby of Merrill Lynch's downtown offices, said Tim
Cagle, a Methuen attorney investigating the incidents for Macoul,
who says he is planning to sue Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   The normally mild-mannered Martineau seemed to become especially
animated during those conversations. ``We believe Mr. Martineau was
making very risky personal trades on those pay phones and that he
had a very serious problem with this,'' Cagle said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Martineau appeared to become increasingly obsessed
with trading and that Merrill Lynch turned a blind eye to symptoms
that should have been obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have evidence that suggests there was a serious problem and
that there were enough signs and red flags that they should have
known something was going on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Merrill Lynch officials said there is no way for a brokerage
firm to monitor all of a broker's outside activities.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the firm said it had no inkling until Martineau's lawyer
appeared at Merrill Lynch's offices shortly after the broker was
found in his wrecked car. After investigating the ``nightmare'' of
a tale that the lawyer detailed of Martineau's activities, the firm
said, it began its own investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch has returned money to clients who had money stolen
or who believed their money was in a Merrill Lynch-backed
investment, Halldin said, but he declined to disclose a dollar
amount. The firm has declined to settle with clients who invested
in Martineau's D &AMP; D Real Estate venture knowing it was not
sanctioned by Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   In his note to family and friends, Martineau took full
responsibility for the millions of dollars in losses. ``Please
don't hold this against Merrill Lynch,'' he wrote. ``They are good.
I was the problem. Desperate people do desperate things.''

UNSTOPPABLE MOVES POSITION MCHALE IN THE HALL OF FAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was Lou Gehrig to Larry Bird's Babe Ruth, and as a result
people never fully grasped just how utterly unique and unstoppable
a basketball player Kevin McHale really was.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best I've ever seen in the pro game with his back to the
basket, for his high rate of efficiency and the fact that he never
gave you the same look due to his diversification of moves,''
declares Hubie Brown, who once had to endure an opening two games
of a playoff series (the 1984 Eastern Conference finals) in which
McHale shot 23 for 28 from the floor against Hubie's Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   There were people who could do a passable defensive job against
Bird. There was, meanwhile, no forward in the world who could
regularly stop McHale, who enters the Basketball Hall of Fame
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rival coaches such as Brown, Chuck Daly, and Pat Riley often
spent more pregame time fretting over McHale than they did Bird,
because there were very few physical beings who had even a remote
chance of matching up with McHale, owner of one of the world's 10
strangest bodies. You could, in theory, put quicker people on Bird
and stronger people on Bird, and their physical superiority might
give them an edge. This was not possible with McHale.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just played off what you were trying to take away,''
explains Brown. ``Players today don't have well-rounded games. They
can't do this.''
</P>
<P>
   The only way to stop McHale was to deny him the ball, but few
could do that, for 50 percent of his low-post work was done before
he ever received the ball. He may have looked scrawny, but he did
have a raw-boned strength, and he combined it with an awareness of
how to use body angles, those ludicrously long arms, good hands,
and a dogged determination to get where he wanted to go. And once
he did establish his preferred spot on the low box, the odds were
way above average that the Celtics were going to come away with a
point or 2.
</P>
<P>
   No great player is ever ultimately about the numbers, but in
rare cases a man's numbers are so far above the norm that it does
him an injustice to ignore them. So here a few:
</P>
<P>
   --He is the only man in the history of the NBA to have had a
season in which he shot 60 percent from the floor and 80 percent
from the line (1986-87). Had he made just one more free throw the
following season, he would have done it again.
</P>
<P>
   --He shot over 50 percent from the floor in 12 of his 13
seasons, missing only in his final year, when his most significant
achievement was dragging his battered body onto the floor.
</P>
<P>
   --In the four-season period from 1984-85 through 1987-88, he
shot 59 percent from the floor in 365 combined regular-season and
playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   --In his five prime seasons, 1983-84 through 1987-88, he shot
better than 50 percent from the floor (that doesn't even count the
games in which he shot (itals)exactly(unials) 50 percent) in 70
percent of the combined total of 470 regular-season and playoff
games.
</P>
<P>
   Included in these totals were a few dunks and tips, but not too
many. The preponderance of his 8,034 lifetime baskets were jump
hooks, turnarounds, up-and-under moves, and snaking baseline
reverse drives that, in many cases, could not have been scored by
any other player in the history of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was 7-feet tall with a great angle release and he was
totally unstoppable,'' marvels Brown.
</P>
<P>
   This unique offensive ability alone would have gotten him to the
Hall of Fame. But there was so much more to his game. The people
who coached him and played with him will always appreciate the fact
that he was as important to his team when it didn't have the
basketball as when it did.
</P>
<P>
   There have been a few better shot blockers, but none other than
McHale whose calling card was ambidexterity. The average
righthanded player blocks 100 percent of his shots righthanded. The
average lefthanded player blocks 100 percent of his shots
lefthanded. No amount of teaching or coaxing can change this
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   McHale represented his own percentile. On the occasion of his
very first Celtics scrimmage, when Bill Fitch thought he would be
teaching the brash rookie a lesson by making him go directly from a
lengthy plane trip (Milan to Boston) to the Hellenic College floor,
McHale demonstrated that he was different from all other players.
When a righthanded player shot, he stuck up his left hand to flick
it away. If someone tried a lefthanded shot, he knocked it away
with his right. It all seemed perfectly natural.
</P>
<P>
   McHale did something else 99.9 percent of all big men can never
do. Just about every other big guy is incapable of making a play
without bouncing the ball. Throw a pass, and the guy puts it on the
floor (where it can be appropriated by a quick-handed foe) before
shooting. Should he grab an offensive rebound, he goes boom to the
floor and the ball has a great chance of being stolen.
</P>
<P>
   McHale never put the ball on the floor when it wasn't necessary.
N-e-v-e-r. As a result, he converted more tippy-toe putbacks than
the rest of the NBA put together, and we're talking about
(itals)everyone(unitals), since 1946. That may sound like a little
thing, but it represented a surprising number of baskets that could
not have been scored by anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   McHale's defensive value far transcended blocked or altered
shots. He was the only 7-footer alive who could regularly guard the
great small forwards of the day. As such, he was the key to the
Boston frontcourt, because he allowed the much slower Bird to take
the weakest member of the other team's front line and thus free
Larry to be a rover, where he was extraordinarily dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   When McHale was on a roll, you were seriously stunned when he
missed. Consider a four-game run of 38 for 50 in 1984; a three-game
run of 30 of 38 in '86; a two-game run of 23 for 27 in '86; a
four-game run of 48 for 66 in '87; a three-game run of 43 for 56 in
'87; a two-game run of 29 for 36 in '87; and a three-game run of 33
for 47 in '88. These numbers are so laughably absurd that we might
as well go ahead and say we will never see anything like them
again.
</P>
<P>
   But what really matters is that all McHale really wanted to do
was win. ``To me,'' says Brown, ``the greatness of Kevin McHale is
not just his athletic ability but the way he accepted that
sixth-man role early in his career. As we all know, thousands of
guys have come into this game with a selfish attitude, unable to
see the big picture. He knew he was going to get his 32-34 minutes
a game and that he would be out there in prime time.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin could never be Larry, but the converse was equally true.
In his prime, the surest way for any NBA team to score on any given
possession was for a Boston Celtic to throw the ball to Kevin
McHale on the low box. The Hall of Fame goes up a significant notch
Saturday night.

BRUINS: HOLDING OUT HOPE FOR SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Another season is upon us and the Bruins head into the
new year absent their No. 1 goaltender, who was last year's most
valuable player, because of an acrimonious contract dispute.
Independent of that, they have improved on defense, with the young
players having another year of experience and some others having a
bit more seasoning.
</P>
<P>
   At forward, the club has four lines that are capable of
producing offense. In an era of expansion, where depth is not only
a rarity but practically unheard of, Boston seems in decent shape.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a breakdown of what can be expected: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FORWARDS _ Centers Jason Allison and Joe Thornton will be the
focal points of the attack. Allison is on the brink of stardom, and
Thornton proved last spring that he can handle a great deal of
responsibility. With wings Steve Heinze, Anson Carter, Sergei
Samsonov, and new addition Dave Andreychuk on the top two lines,
the Bruins will be able to compete with any other team in the NHL.
A third line of Mikko Eloranta and mainstays P.J. Axelsson and Rob
DiMaio will give the team solidity, and fourth-line prospects Shawn
Bates, Landon Wilson, Ken Belanger, and Cameron Mann give coach Pat
Burns options he didn't have last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're really solid,'' said Allison, who led the team
in scoring with 76 points last year. ``If you look down the list,
we have (several) 20-goal scorers. I'm counting Joe because he's
going to get 20 this year; we have (four) who already have and one
who probably should. Not too many teams have that. We're definitely
all capable of getting between 20-40. Forty is a lot, but if
someone gets hot and picks their game up, they're capable.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison, who arrived in Boston after a late-season trade in
March 1997, even said he thought this team is the best Bruins club
he's ever played on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're by far the best we've been in the three years
I've been here,'' he said. ``It depends on how everyone plays. If
everyone plays to the top of their game, we have a lot of
firepower. We have to play defensive, but we also have to play with
confidence and be offensive when we get our opportunities.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSE _ The situation behind the blue line is very promising.
Ray Bourque, coming off a year when he was a candidate for the
Norris Trophy as the league's top defenseman, is back for his 21st
season. The other members of the top six are Kyle McLaren, Hal
Gill, Don Sweeney, Darren Van Impe, and Mattias Timander. Others in
the mix are Brandon Smith and young prospects Jonathan Girard and
Nick Boynton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like them,'' said McLaren of the assembled blue-liners. ``I
really do. We've got a few guys back from last year, four or five
solid guys who played a lot of minutes. With the young guys coming
up, it's going to really help us. I like our defense tremendously.
I think we have one of the best defenses around. We don't get a lot
of points but we play solid and we play well as a unit, and I think
that's a big (tribute) to (assistant coach Jacques Laperriere).
There's only one superstar out there and that's Raymond. So, all of
us have to bust our butts to get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   If there's an area in which the team can improve, it's reducing
the number of shots against even if many of them came from the
periphery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we gave up a lot of shots last year,'' said McLaren.
``I was remembering some of the shots and a lot of them were
outside the blue line and from the red line. If a goaltender can't
stop those, he shouldn't be in the league. Still, we've got to play
stronger as a unit.''
</P>
<P>
   The one question lurking is whether the defensemen will feel
obligated to do anything differently with Rob Tallas between the
pipes instead of Byron Dafoe, who remains unsigned. McLaren said it
isn't really an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go out and play the same way in front of anybody who's back
there unless it's a guy brought up from (the East Coast League) or
a junior guy,'' said McLaren. ``He's been here enough; we've played
in front of him. He's played well. There are some games where we're
not having a good night or he's not having a good night. We have to
complement each other. Sure, we can play tighter in front of him
and get the job done better.''
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, McLaren said they're not putting undue
pressure on Tallas to fill Dafoe's substantial skates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a talented goaltender but he's not Byron Dafoe,'' he
said. ``People have to realize that. The expectation for him to be
Byron is not going to be there. Just like I'm not going to be
another Ray Bourque. He's going to be Robbie Tallas, and he's an
excellent goaltender. It's going to be a challenge; it's going to
be fun to watch. He's jumping out of his net and moving the puck
well. It helps our confidence a lot and helps his.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GOALIES _ Tallas has earned a shot and John Grahame earned his
stripes last year when he led Providence to the Calder Cup
championship. However, it's still a crap shoot. Neither has the
credentials of Dafoe. Whether they can earn them or not remains to
be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard because the players are down, reading everything
about Byron and seeing all the frustration and they're thinking,
`Wow, we're not getting Byron back,' when maybe earlier there was a
little bit of hope,'' said Tallas.
</P>
<P>
   As for the coach, Burns said he's taking the high road and is
filled with optimism, cautious as that might be.
</P>

BUSH'S SILENCE ISN'T GOLDEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush first babbled about ``compassionate
conservatism'' last winter when he was a cipher in a cocoon, all
but declared the Republican nominee for president with almost no
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Spared for the moment of wrestling with the demons in his party,
Bush said he would champion the policies of the right, cutting
taxes and promoting longer prison sentences and smaller government,
while making sure ``no child gets left behind.'' He said his
shrunken government would nonetheless ``inspire people to reach out
to other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Bush has to wrestle with the demons, he is reaching out
all right _ to the far-out right _ and we now understand this
gibberish for what it is. ``Compassionate conservatism'' is no
grand mosaic of noblese oblige. It is more like holding one's nose
over an outbreak of noble rot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compassionate conservatism'' simply means being compassionate
to conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   This became clear in Bush's handling of Pat Buchanan in the last
seven days. Buchanan, the paranoid, white, Christian-rights
activist who masquerades as a protectionist populist, is thinking
of bolting the Republican Party for the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Republicans, such as presidential candidate John
McCain, said the party should show Buchanan the door. Besides his
long-standing myopia on people of color, gay men and lesbians, and
non-Christian religions, Buchanan recently poured more lighter
fluid on his toes by asserting in a new book that the West
overreacted to a Hitler who was no threat to the United States.
McCain said Buchanan's book is ``so far outside of the philosophy
of what America is all about that it's unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not unacceptable to Bush. Bush said, ``I don't want Pat
Buchanan to leave the party. I think it's important, should I be
the nominee, to unite the Republican Party. I'm going to need every
vote I can get among Republicans to win the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days ago, Bush repeated his desire for Buchanan to stay in
the party, even as he blamed Buchanan and Ross Perot for bleeding
to death the 1992 presidential campaign of his father with a
``thousand cuts.'' On top of that, Republican Party chairman Jim
Nicholson pleaded with Buchanan not to leave the party, asking
Buchanan to consider that a Republican split could result in
liberal Democratic appointments to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush to be so compassionate with this particular demon is a
dead giveaway that he will display no particular courage on the
divisive issues that lie ahead of him as president. If you cannot
stand up to Buchanan, who can you stand up to?
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan has said that AIDS is nature's ``retribution against
homosexuals.'' He has opposed virtually every modern civil rights
law. He has praised the ``winning issues'' of ex-Ku Klux Klansman
and politician David Duke. He has said Hitler was a man of ``great
courage.'' He has said women are not endowed with the
``single-minded ambition and the will to suceed in the fiercely
competitive world of Western capitalism.''
</P>
<P>
   The acceptance of Buchanan comes in the wake of Bush's cowardice
over a proposed hate crimes law in Texas. The law was proposed
after James Byrd, an African-American, was dragged to death by a
truck driven by white racists. Senate Republicans in the Texas
Legislature killed the bill. Senate Democrats charged that the
Republicans would not go forward with a bill that singled out
penalties not only for racist crimes, but also for hate crimes
against gay men and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all gets back to sexual orientation,'' said state Senator
John Whitmire. Whitmire said that despite the gruesome lynching of
Byrd, including of homosexuals in the bill was too much of a
``political litmus test'' for the Republicans to handle.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two months ago, Bush was winning praise for appearing
to be a sensitive conservative. California political consultant
Allan Hoffenblum said, ``George Bush isn't listening to the loony
right.'' Republican consultant Eddie Mahe said Bush ``is a
conservative without scaring people.''
</P>
<P>
   That illusion is over. By being silent on the hate-crimes law
and by begging for the leader of the loony right to remain a
Republican, Bush is becoming scary for showing no desire to drive
out the demons. If he cannot drive them out of his own party, which
is virtually handing him the nomination, there is no reason to
think that the cipher will do anything except crawl back into his
cocoon at the first crisis in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   After all, a candidate who blusters that a rival helped inflict
a thousand cuts on his father, yet still wants that rival in the
fold is also likely to wait until a thousand cuts have been
inflicted upon the disenfranchised and the oppressed before
offering a dollop of his ``compassionate conservatism.''

TWIST TO LIFE IN NEW YORK CITY: MOSQUITOES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The area around Powell's Cove Park in northern Queens
is a tidy, upper-middle-class neighborhood _ spacious,
single-family houses with BMWs and SUVs parked in the driveways and
satellite dishes perched on the roofs.
</P>
<P>
   It hardly seems like the breeding ground for a disease more
commonly found in the Third World.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this is the main ``hot zone'' of New York's great mosquito
scare, which has hospitalized 43 people with West Nile encephalitis
and killed six, including a Canadian businessman who caught the
virus when he visited Queens last month.
</P>
<P>
   And the disease could spread to other regions of the country, as
birds carrying it migrate south for warmer weather.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,300 dead birds, mainly crows, have been reported in
the New York City area since the alarm bells went off a month ago.
The federal Centers for Disease Control tested 39 of these birds
and 429 live ones. In both categories, more than one-third tested
positive for the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The virus, which causes inflammation of the brain, was
transmitted to humans by mosquitoes that have bitten the infected
birds. A place like Powell's Cove Park _ with its vast puddles of
swamp water that drain slowly, if at all _ is an ideal nesting
pool.
</P>
<P>
   The city has been spraying insecticides over the entire city,
especially over Queens, the borough harboring two-thirds of the
confirmed cases of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani declared victory over the mosquitoes a
couple weeks ago, but after a torrential rainstorm, they revived
and the spraying resumed.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Friday, health officials will take blood samples of 300
randomly chosen Queens residents in an attempt to trace the virus's
path.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Kim, a wholesaler with two children, lives across the
street from Powell's Cove Park. ``Everybody around here is
worried,'' he said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Kim has spent more than $100 on household insecticides and
insect repellents _ sprays, candles, and zappers. Despite all of
his and the city's efforts, he said, ``I still see mosquitoes in
the house.''
</P>
<P>
   At a nearby Target discount store across from another ``hot
spot'' _ a swamp that was once the site of an airport _ bug sprays
have been moved from the camping department, where they are usually
shelved, to the pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've sold about twice as much bug spray as we usually do,''
said Andre Janiak, the store's pharmacist. However, he added,
``Nobody's in a panic. New Yorkers don't panic over very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Friedl was one of several shoppers who confirmed this
point. A retiree and, therefore, vulnerable to the virus _ which
most readily hits the very old and very young _ she said, ``I
really haven't been concerned. I've seen fewer mosquitoes than
usual in fact, maybe because they've been sprayed _ though I have
seen a lot of dead squirrels.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were less complacent. Anna Avalone, shopping with her
3-year-old son, said, ``We've curtailed a lot of outdoor
activities. And when they spray, I don't leave toys or his bicycle
out on the terrace. I get a little paranoid, but you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to say which has made people edgier _ the insects or
the insecticides.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Andrews, spokesman for Queens borough President Claire
Schulman,said, ``The calls we've been getting are mostly about the
spraying, not about the virus.''
</P>
<P>
   If the virus had broken out a year from now, it might not have
loomed so large in Powell's Cove Park.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the crisis began, the city's parks department was set to
break ground on a project to reconstruct the salt marsh that once
dominated the cove _ a task involving the removal of a 9-foot-thick
layer of rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Matsil, chief of the department's natural resources group,
said that in the decades after World War II, when Robert Moses
tried to turn New York City into one vast development project,
thousands of acres of marshes were turned into dumping grounds for
construction-and-demolition rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Salt marshes had provided drainage for rainwater. But as the
rubble grew, the water sat stagnant. ``So these areas became a
breeding habitat for mosquitoes and ticks,'' Matsil said.
</P>
<P>
   The city has been restoring these marshes, but the job is far
from finished.
</P>
<P>
   Several residents say the city has also reduced routine insect
spraying. ``They used to spray here every summer,'' Jesse Kim said.
``But in the last several years, they've done it only once. They're
doing a lot now, but maybe they're a little late.''

 &HT;    IOC PRESIDENT, MEMBERS MAY TESTIFY BEFORE HOUSE PANEL ON BIDDING
PROCESS
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and Sports categories.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at)

<P>
   ATHENS, Greece - The International Olympic Committee is weighing
the merits of an appearance by President Juan Antonio Samaranch
before a U.S. congressional committee investigating allegations of
excessive gift giving during Atlanta's campaign for the 1996 Games.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC executive board, starting weekend meetings in the host
city of the 2004 Games, discussed the matter briefly Friday but had
not reached a conclusion, said Franklin Servan-Schreiber, the
committee's spokesman. The touchy subject is certain to come again
during the meetings here.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting behind closed doors, the executive board officially
received a written report from the IOC's ethics commission
indicating that the panel is evaluating allegations that Atlanta
lobbyists violated bidding rules by showering IOC members with
gifts and favors during the campaign to host the Centennial Games.
</P>
<P>
   The ethics commission review of the Atlanta report is expected
to be completed before the IOC holds a special session in December
to consider sweeping reforms intended to end criticism that the
bidding process is hopelessly corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   The report, written by former U.S. Attorney General Griffin
Bell, was based on documents provided to Congress by Atlanta
Olympics officials. Bell is now with the Atlanta law firm of King &AMP;
Spalding, which provided legal services to Atlanta Olympics
organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Fred Upton, the Michigan Republican leading the charge in
the House, has expressed shock at the report's revelations. Upton
has asked Samaranch to appear before his House Commerce Committee's
subcommittee on oversight and investigations later this month.
</P>
<P>
   IOC members close to Samaranch have advised him not to make the
appearance, which almost certainly would cause the 79-year-old
president considerable embarrassment. The former diplomat, who has
been IOC president since 1980, is not used to the kind of rigorous
questioning he can expect in a hostile Congressional hearing.
Samaranch, who is generally treated not unlike a head of state,
declined an invitation to appear before a Senate committee last
spring.
</P>
<P>
   However, IOC officials worry that Upton's committee may issue
subpoenas requiring them to appear before the House panel.
</P>
<P>
   As it wrestles with its problems in Washington, the IOC is
reconsidering plans to come to the United States for February
meetings in Salt Lake City, the host city for the 2002 Winter
Games, and Colorado Springs, Colo., the home of the U.S. Olympic
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Servan-Schreiber acknowledged the meetings could be delayed,
postponed or canceled because of schedule conflicts. However, he
said he was unaware of any connection between discussions about the
meetings and the prospect that IOC members, including Samaranch,
could be served subpoenas if they enter the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks bad,'' he said. ``But there is no link.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch has not traveled to the United States since the Salt
Lake City scandal surfaced about a year ago. He and other IOC
members are subject to possible questioning by the FBI in
connection with the federal law-enforcement agency's Salt Lake
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake Tribune reported Friday that a letter faxed to
U.S. Olympic Committee officials this week said the meeting in Salt
Lake City had been canceled because of a scheduling conflict.
Servan-Schreiber denied that and said that, for now, both meetings
are still on.
</P>
<P>
   Upton wants to question Samaranch about how the IOC selects
cities to host the Olympics. Salt Lake City has admitted to using
expensive gifts, cash and offers of scholarships to influence IOC
members.

`THREE KINGS' IS A ROYAL FLUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Three Kings,'' is a post-colonial, post-war,
action-heist-comedy-satire-farce-screwball circus that's like
``MASH'' being churned by a sneering, over-amped organ grinder.
</P>
<P>
   The writer-director of ``Three Kings'' is David O. Russell and
after two movies, he has revealed himself as a filmmaker who
officially matters. With this, he's invited himself into the
hangover that was the end of the Gulf War and he didn't bring any
Tylenol, just more ammo for its pandemonious after-party.
</P>
<P>
   For the guys in ``Three Kings,'' the Gulf War was more fun than
trying to save Private Ryan, and most of them didn't even fight.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when we're introduced to a bunch of guys in the Army
Reserve, their trigger fingers itch and they're butt-sore from
riding the Gulf War bench. So they play desert games and Sgt. Troy
Barlow (Mark Wahlberg) accidentally shoots a guy.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to those same soldiers and a couple of dozen more cracking a
few beers and turning a tent-barracks into a makeshift frat house
cold-rocking to Public Enemy and Snap; Special Forces Capt. Archie
Gates (solid George Clooney, doing no wrong) humping the pretty,
mock-CNN correspondent (Judy Greer) on a chair.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, when Troy and his hick sidekick, Pvt. Conrad Vig
(videomaker Spike Jonze), discover a treasure map protruding from
an Iraqi's nether region like a bad suppository, they see it as an
opportunity to get some action and some bank.
</P>
<P>
   The map leads to tens of millions in dollars in gold that Saddam
Hussein stole from Kuwait, and the four guys who go after it are
high on ``Kelly's Heroes'' bravado. They hop in a Humvee, thinking
it'll be relatively easy to retrieve the loot, as if being
Americans not only entitles them to the gold's re-theft, but
empowers them.
</P>
<P>
   One blown-up cow, one exploded milk tanker and dozens of angry,
agonizing Kuwaitis later, Archie, Troy, Conrad and God- fearing,
Jesus-loving Chief Elgin (Ice Cube) are more emasculated than they
were when they jumped in that Humvee, drowning in more fabulously
chintzy merchandise than a ``Wheel of Fortune'' marathon.
</P>
<P>
   In one great moment, Archie, Troy and Chief stumble into a lair
with the gold, guarded by sentinels entranced by news footage of
the Rodney King beating and smitten with Eddie Murphy's ``Party All
the Time.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a harrowing, funny, surreally grotesque scene woozy and
taut with all the film's media, racial pop-culture tensions. At its
crassest and most complex, the Gulf War was about stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three Kings'' owes a great deal to Robert Altman's ``MASH,''
which was as intricately folded into itself as an origami M-16. Its
comedy came from the irony that a college dorm/paradise and a war
environment could coexist, so long as Altman and his characters
were flipping anti-establishment birds.
</P>
<P>
   But infused in ``Three Kings'' shenanigans is a sober
biblicality and sense of greater good that Altman, at his most
flippant, didn't have to assume. Russell's film treads the same
land-mine-strewn dangerous ground Iraq intended for the Bush
administration with the right-minded wherewithal to try to do the
right thing in a desert in which everything is so foreign and wrong
it may as well be set on Tatooine.
</P>
<P>
   But if ``Party All the Time'' is the film's unofficial theme,
Russell supplies a beautiful, searing comedown in which the Arab
characters speak for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Amir (Cliff Curtis), a displaced Kuwaiti leading a group of
fellow refugees, agrees to help the soldiers carry the bag of gold
across the desert, if Archie, Chief and Conrad help them get across
the Iraq-Kuwait border. That request is juxtaposed with Said, one
of Saddam's soldiers (``L'Haine'' star Said Taghmaoui) strapping
Troy to a chair and electro-shocking him.
</P>
<P>
   It's an exquisitely executed scene with the enthralling
Taghmaoui turning anguish into quiet seething as Said articulates
his grief over having lost his family in a war that in his
estimation was about oil.
</P>
<P>
   It's an encounter that begins with a metaphorical question about
Michael Jackson and ends in torture. We've seen the
American-gets-abused-foreigner sequence before, but never with the
personal-political dimensions operating here.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis and Taghmaoui are two of the great performances eddying
around the film, which gives Walhberg's sweaty deadpan the comic
hue it's needed. He's never been more dynamically effective, along
with Cube, expertly throwing lines away like they were leftover
casseroles; and Jonze playing a churlish Timothy McVeigh is da
bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Mykelti Williamson is the hothead captain looking for the AWOL
soldiers. And Jamie Kennedy plays a Gomer Pyle-ish private assigned
to distract Nora Dunn's acerbic, staggeringly funny Christiane
Amanpour knock-off from doing a story on Archie and the treasure.
</P>
<P>
   Russell's filmmaking takes on the overlit, schizo,
shifting-film-stock crazy-cutting of an Oliver Stone day-mare in
which the sun even seems to wear a party hat. The frenetic roving
hand-held cinematography-stuntwork by Newton Thomas Sigel and
Robert K. Lambert's editing as Sigel's partner in breakneck crime
create the dizzy disorientation of its setting.
</P>
<P>
   The style also complements Russell's screen-writing, which is
still as character-obsessed as ``Spanking the Monkey'' or
``Flirting With Disaster,'' only now it's the characters' content
that matters as opposed to their neurotic dysfunction.

<P>
   BOSTON _ It used to be a staple of home economics class, the
quintessential sort of ``women's work,'' which is why Mariama
White-Hammond, 20, gets funny looks when she pulls out her
cross-stitch in dorm rooms, airports, and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Her friends say she looks like a grandmother, a label she
doesn't especially mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much is lost,'' she said, ``in not doing the things that our
grandmothers did.''
</P>
<P>
   But even young devotees like White-Hammond _ a tall,
smartlydressed Stanford University student who doesn't exactly fit
the ``grandma'' mold _ concede that needlepoint, cross-stitch, and
knitting aren't the staples they used to be. Most women are too
busy, they say, or too self-conscious about seeming old-fashioned
or domestic. They are more likely to buy a hand-knit sweater than
to make one.
</P>
<P>
   So it's sad, but not shocking, they say, to hear that the
nation's oldest knitting and needlework retailer is closing. The
fiber arts department at the Women's Educational and Industrial
Union folded Friday (Oct. 1), a casualty of the changing retail
market, changing demands, changing lives.
</P>
<P>
   The department dates back to 1877, the year The Shop at the
Union was founded to help women sell their handiwork. For years,
the craft and gift store sold needles, canvases, threads and yarn,
and hired employees skilled enough to coach their customers out of
a stitch gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the last of that merchandise was piled into
clearance bins and pushed into one cramped corner of the store. On
a recent afternoon, a 71-year-old Cape Cod resident looked at the
spread and shook her head. ``Typical,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She has been knitting since the age of 12, buying wool at the
Union for 50 years, said the woman, whowould give only her first
name, Evelyn. But she can sense the changing times, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't exactly see us as a culture of knit-by-the-fire.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some knitting and needlework specialists report a
renewed interest in the crafts. The 10,000-member Knitting Guild of
America is growing, and gaining more young, professional women,
founder Carol Wigginton said.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered through the city, the region, and the country are
small groups of women _ and a few men _ who have taken up sewing of
different sorts. Gabrielle Marroig, 32, and Colleen Mulcahy, 26,
said a group of women at their office, most of them pregnant,
recently started a knitting circle. Now, they're hooked and trying
to spread the word.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister made fun of me until I made her a chenille scarf,''
Mulcahy said. ``And now, she wants me to teach her how to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But when you pick it up only occasionally, a single scarf or
sweater can take months to complete, Marroig and Mulcahy said as
they rifled through the Union's last skeins of yarn. Wigginton,
too, said that knitting takes more money and time than every woman
has.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can spend $500 in yarn for a sweater,'' she said. ``And
then you have to knit the darned thing.''
</P>
<P>
   That time crunch has clearly affected Union sales, said Laurie
Tuttle, the store's communications director. Some customers have
given up their crafts. Others have started to buy supplies from
mail-order catalogs or the Internet. Four years ago, the department
sold $215,000 worth of goods. Last year, sales were down to
$150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders tried to salvage the department with new marketing
techniques, special merchandise, and classes, said Mary Lassen,
executive director of the Union. Still, sales continued to falter,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   And because store proceeds support social programs, from career
centers to homes for battered women, the Union can't afford to
subsidize a department for tradition's sake, Lassen said. Her
organization has survived, she said, by ``being willing to innovate
and be on the cutting edge, and being willing to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, letting go has itself become a Union tradition. In the
1940s, the Union turned over its school lunch program, the first in
the nation, to Boston public schools. In the 1980s, in another
decision driven by economics, the Union closed the cafe where it
used to serve daily tea.
</P>
<P>
   Like the changes that preceded it, this week's closing is
emotional, Union trustee Barbara Mohrman said. She discovered the
union in the mid-1970s, she said, when her roommate dragged her to
a needlepoint class. But she hasn't had time to ply her craft in
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been guilty of that, along with everybody else,'' she
said.

MOVES, PERSPECTIVE   WON'T BE DUPLICATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The clues were there, long before he signed his first contract.
If ``The Kevin McHale Story'' were a feature-length film, no one
would be silly enough to label it a mystery. The early evidence was
unmistakable: the kid was a bit unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours after the Celtics drafted him, McHale sat casually
in Red Auerbach's office, as if it were the family den. He talked
of an upcoming fishing trip to Red Sand Lake in Canada. He said his
father was probably at home in the family kitchen, dancing an Irish
jig with the news that the Celtics drafted his son. He even
congratulated Red on making the trade with Golden State that also
brought Robert Parish to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   It's obvious that McHale had wit and perspective at a young age.
Even if you are not a Celtics fan, you should steal one of those
attributes from him on his being inducted into the Hall of Fame in
Springfield, Mass. Steal his perspective. You'll enjoy the ceremony
more that way because you will realize that, barring an NBA
revolution, you'll never see a player like McHale again. Will you
see better players? Yes. But you probably won't see another McHale
``type.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows this is the era of instant judgment and neat
labels, from business to sports. But if you put McHale's career on
a musical staff, it would stun you with its rapid chord
progressions. We like to know immediately if an athlete is an
average player, franchise player, or Hall of Famer. McHale
increased his scoring average in seven consecutive seasons, going
from an average player, to a very good one, to a co-franchise one,
to a Hall of Fame one.
</P>
<P>
   You won't see that again, especially from a player taken with
the third pick in the draft as McHale was. McHale developed. The
theory now is that if you are taken third, you had better give
previews of what your future holds. And do it fast. Ask your
typical pro coach about development and he'll say, ``Send it
overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   But a rising scoring average is not the only McHale quirk. You
have heard plenty about his odd body _ 6 feet 10 inches, 225
pounds, exceedingly long vines for arms, and a barrel chest. At
times he looked like a Goth in basketball shorts. The body, alone,
did not make him rare. It was the mentality that went with it.
</P>
<P>
   That is, McHale was not a '90s-type of low-post man. He didn't
want to be a 6-10 guard. His chamber was somewhere between 5 and 10
feet away from the hoop. He gave clinics in there to anyone trying
to guard him. That area was like his own theater. When he was
fouled, he would often go to the baseline where a ballboy would
throw him a towel so he could wipe his hands and face. It was part
of the routine. That strange body allowed him to keep the ball
centimeters out of a frustrated opponent's reach at all times.
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar had the toughest shot to block. McHale was
right after him.
</P>
<P>
   You won't see that again. Because he wasn't the most talented
dribbler, McHale spent most of his time mastering moves around the
basket rather than the perimeter. He was an angles man. If you have
ever wondered how a great pool player would play basketball, you
already know. McHale could work the side pocket. He could work the
corner pocket. He could make the ball skip. Some of his shots were,
simply, ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   Today, when a hawkish 6-10 player tells you that he is simply
interested in hanging out in the post, the tendency is to respond,
``You do?'' (Warning to all NBA teams outside of Minnesota: McHale
sharing his low-post craftiness with the talented Kevin Garnett
should frighten all of you.)
</P>
<P>
   The most important reason to be a Prospective Thief tonight?
Think of what could have been. You may do this with your spouse,
girlfriend, or boyfriend. Example: ``Honey, if I had taken that job
in Chicago, do you realize we probably wouldn't have met?'' It's a
similar story with McHale.
</P>
<P>
   Boston had the first and 13th picks in the 1980 draft and
initially talked about drafting center Joe Barry Carroll first.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get Carroll and the number 13, to go along with what
we've got, we'll still be a formidable ball club,'' Celtics coach
Bill Fitch said before the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Formidable in intelligence maybe (Carroll is a stock market
whiz), but not in terms of ability. Another draft possibility was
Louisville guard Darrell ``Dr. Dunkenstein'' Griffith, who said he
wanted to play with the Celtics. A couple of nights before the
draft, Fitch and assistant coach Jimmie Rodgers met in Fitch's
apartment and continued to debate who was better: McHale or
Carroll. They decided on McHale, traded the No. 1 pick to Golden
State for the third pick and some guy named Robert Parish, and
sweated it out when Utah, picking second, paused dramatically
before calling Griffith's name on draft day.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen years after that draft, there will be stories about the
comedic McHale. There will be stories about the way he defended and
the way he never missed from close range. They will be good
stories, ones that will make you laugh and reminisce.
</P>
<P>
   But if you are in Springfield when the tales are being told,
make sure you snap a photo of McHale as you're laughing. And when
you get them developed, request doubles. They will be the only
reasonable McHale duplications you will ever see.

CREED LIVES OUT THE EVERYKID DREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Creed's music was just called ``Everyguy Rock'' by Rolling
Stone. That suggests the media haven't been able to create any
overweening hype or controversy on the Florida band. And that's
fine with its members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably a good thing that the media didn't jump on us
and hype us up,'' says Creed drummer Scott Phillips. ``We had to
crawl our way along and didn't let the hype go to our heads. We
didn't get blown up as being four hunks or four sharp dressers,
that's for sure. Our success was definitely built on the music.''
</P>
<P>
   Creed's debut disc, ``My Own Prison,'' was the No. 1-selling
hard rock album last year and has moved 4 million copies. It also
yielded four hit singles, including the title track and ``What's
This Life For.''
</P>
<P>
   Creed is back with a new album, ``Human Clay,'' and a tour with
Our Lady Peace and Oleander. The new album may not drive away any
of the Pearl Jam sound-alike charges the group has received but
shouldn't slow sales momentum, either. The album rocks, and in
today's poseur climate, that's saying something.
</P>
<P>
   It also finds singer/lyricist Scott Stapp baring his heart
again, though in a different way. ``A lot of tunes on the new album
are less introspective about Scott's personal life than on the
first album. They're more about the world, which Scott has been
looking at since the birth of his son,'' says Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a new song, ``With Arms Wide Open,'' was written from
the perspective of impending fatherhood. No wonder this band has an
``Everyguy'' tag. The group sings about real concerns for real
people.
</P>
<P>
   Creed has sometimes been misconstrued as a Christian band, since
lyricist Stapp grew up with strict Christian parents who wouldn't
let him listen to rock 'n' roll, unless it was by the spiritually
charged (and hence, approved) U2.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we're a fairly spiritual band but certainly not a
Christian band,'' says Phillips, adding that some of the group's
songs question doctrinaire beliefs. And how many Christian bands
would have first named themselves Naked Toddler, as Creed did?
</P>
<P>
   Creed was hatched four years ago by four Tallahassee friends
(and Florida State students) from different musical backgrounds.
Phillips loved R &AMP; B. Stapp grew up with gospel. Bassist Brian
Marshall was a lover of the classic-rock of Rush, Led Zeppelin, and
Pink Floyd. Guitarist Mark Tremonti was a huge Metallica fan. Put
these influences together and out pops Creed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got lucky,'' says Phillips. ``We're living every kid's
dream.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Emmylou/Linda transcend trends: There are singers who follow
trends _ and a few singers like Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt
who pay no attention to them. ``We made this album for all the
right reasons that have to do with lyrics and music, not with
looking for a hit single,'' Harris says of her new record with
Ronstadt called ``Western Wall: The Tucson Sessions.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a compelling album in which the two singers record quality
songs by Leonard Cohen, Sinead O'Connor, Patti Scialfa, Bruce
Springsteen, and former Bostonian Patty Griffin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The album has charted on the country charts, but we couldn't
get played on country radio. We're over the age limit,'' Harris
says in a sad but true statement. ``But I'm having a great time. I
feel as creative as I've ever been. And I've been able to do a lot
of projects that are very nourishing and inspiring. There is life
after radio.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she laughs about how hard it is to categorize the new
album, which was recorded in Tucson, where Ronstadt lives. ``You
walk into a record store and one day it's placed in the folk bin
and the next day in the country bin. But we don't mind. The main
thing is we're doing whatever we want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes the album special is the close harmonies between
Ronstadt and Harris, whether it's on Cohen's ``Sisters of Mercy''
(sung also with the McGarrigle Sisters, who are old friends of the
artists) or Springsteen's ``Across the Border,'' taken from his
``Tom Joad'' sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linda and I have pretty much made our living as being
interpreters in a world that is dictated and ruled by
singer-songwriters,'' says Harris. ``I do some writing, but most of
my artistic work is interpreting.''
</P>
<P>
   She may downplay her writing skills, but there are two gems she
wrote on the new CD: ``Raise the Dead'' (with the haunting verse
``I wrestled the devil, lived to testify . . . But I'll never get
out of your love alive'') and the playful ``Sweet Spot,'' cowritten
by Jill Cunniff of Luscious Jackson, with whom Harris toured on
Lilith Fair last year.
</P>
<P>
   Backing the singers on tour is Bernie Leadon (who used to play
with the Eagles), Buddy Miller, and Paul McCartney's former
keyboardist, Wix. ``It's a small group, but extremely versatile,''
says Harris. ``And, really, if you like Linda Ronstadt, you should
know this may be the last time you'll see her because she may
retire from the road.''
</P>
<P>

   Garth pulls it off: If you were waiting for Garth Brooks to fall
flat in his portrayal of fictitious rocker Chris Gaines on an NBC
concert special Wednesday, you'll have to wait some more. Brooks
pulled it off. Some think he's toying with career suicide in the
role of Gaines, but Brooks emerged with integrity intact. He talked
about Gaines (a supposed rocker whose career is ongoing) in the
third person, so as to avoid foolishness.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, who loves rock 'n' roll though he's made his livelihood
in country, told the TV audience, ``The closer you look, Garth
Brooks is Chris Gaines.'' His band for the occasion included former
Springsteen bassist Tommy Sims and Billy Joel/Bob Seger
percussionist Crystal Taliefero. They helped make the music
believable, as did Brooks's natural, born-entertainer stage
presence.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Caught in the act: Out of the ashes of Sublime, whose singer
Brad Nowell overdosed in 1996, comes Long Beach Dub Allstars, a
slinky, skanking septet that made its Boston debut Wednesday at the
sold-out Paradise, with ample aid from reggae aces Barrington Levy
and Half Pint. Sublime's rhythm section, bassist Eric Wilson and
drummer Bud Gaugh, powers the Allstars. The three acts teamed up
for nearly three hours of music; we got there around the halfway
point and witnessed a rock/reggae mix, which brought back memories
of prime-time Clash and Specials. The Allstars are not averse to
punk spurts, but mostly they're into deep, echo-y dub styles and
sinuous rhythmic grooves, with as much emphasis on the spaces
between the notes as the notes themselves. They reworked several
Sublime tunes and featured tracks from their debut disc, ``Right
Back.'' A warm vibe from a band with a future.

   Bits and Pieces: Susan Tedeschi was just added to VH-1's

Eric Clapton, Aretha Franklin, Garth Brooks, Bono, Sheryl Crow, and
John Mellencamp. Speaking of VH1, Alanis Morissette opens the new
season of VH1's ``Storyteller'' series Sunday at 10:30 p.m.

A PREDICTABLE BUT LIKABLE `DRIVE ME CRAZY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
DRIVE ME CRAZY 
Directed by: John Schultz 
Screenplay by: Rob Thomas (based on Todd Strasser's novel, ``How I
Created My Perfect Prom Date'') 
Starring: Adrian Grenier, Melissa Joan Hart, Stephen Collins, Susan
May Pratt, Mark Webber, Kris Park, Ali Larter, Gabriel Carpenter 
Running time: 103 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Drive Me Crazy'' gets by on the watchability of its young
stars, Adrian Grenier and Melissa Joan Hart, as next-door neighbors
who were close as kids, go their different ways in high school, and
in general fool around for 120 pages until they reach a destination
where they will find the audience sitting waiting for them, having
arrived long before. ``Drive Me Crazy'' has several things going
for it, but unpredictability is not one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Even the differentiation between Hart's Nicole and Grenier's
Chase is more than a bit prefab. She's a bit aggressively
caricatured as a smart senior who has covered all of her scholastic
and extracurricular bases only to find to her surprise that her
game plan develops a hitch when the basketball star she expects to
take her to the prom dates someone else. Grenier's Chase, as the
anti-frat, anti-jock social dropout who fancies himself
disaffected, finds himself dumped by his alternative-lifestyle
girlfriend (an amusingly politicized goth played by Ali Larter).
</P>
<P>
   So they fall back on their old acquaintance for what they tell
themselves is romantic strategy. They agree to date each other in
order to fill their respective exes with jealous regret, not
foreseeing the obvious outcome, or at least pretending not to. What
saves ``Drive Me Crazy'' from becoming the merest exercise in
connecting the dots is Grenier's ability to convince us that
there's something going on behind his eyes, that Chase really is
intelligent enough to reject the airhead conformity that Nicole
finally jettisons as well.
</P>
<P>
   With Nicole, it's a matter of unthinking acceptance of peer
pressure. Hart convinces us that Nicole knows better, but needs to
develop enough self-confidence to step back and go with her inner
prompts. The message of being your own person and rejecting
peer-group tyranny plays well, with appealing sidekick
contributions from Kris Park and Keri Lynn Pratt, even though
there's nothing particularly original or distinctive about ``Drive
Me Crazy'' as a film. At times, it seems little more than
standard-issue connective tissue for the soundtrack, with
performances by Britney Spears and The Backstreet Boys, among
others, and music by Greg Kendall, who earlier collaborated with
director John Schultz on ``Bandwagon.'' If only ``Drive Me Crazy''
had a little real craziness.

`MYSTERY, ALASKA' SKATES ON THIN ICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
MYSTERY, ALASKA 
Directed by: Jay Roach 
Screenplay by: David E. Kelley &AMP; Sean O'Byrne 
Starring: Russell Crowe, Hank Azaria, Mary McCormack, Lolita
Davidovich, Ron Eldard, Colm Meaney, Maury Chaykin, Burt Reynolds 
Running time: 118 minutes 
Rated: R (language and sexuality) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   David E. Kelley keeps trying to move from TV success into film
success, and ``Mystery, Alaska'' shows that he's getting there.
Still, Kelley's new film is more than a little reminiscent of
``Picket Fences,'' as it weaves a tapestry of small-town Alaskans
who take their hockey very seriously and their women not seriously
enough. The comedy arises from a collision between their purity and
eccentricities and a voracious media culture that discovers them
via a Sports Illustrated article that balloons into a network TV
special built around an exhibition game with the New York Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   While the game pumps up the individual and collective sense of
self-esteem, it clearly confirms the locals' suspicion of being
gobbled up by corporate bigness. It's a theme that dwindles to
nothing in an errant plot strand involving a superstore coming to
town and crowding out the homegrown merchants of the Alaskan town
called (mysteriously, since it never is explained) Mystery. Before
the players can blink, in come the construction crews, bordering
their pond with boards to serve as display space for ads, followed
by TV types who cavalierly nickname the team the Eskimos.
</P>
<P>
   In vain do the locals explain that there are few Native
Americans in town, much less on the team, and that they prefer to
be called Inuit. The point is made that the media blitz isn't
interested in reporting what's there, but in shoehorning what's
there into the media's formats and formulas. In short, it's an
argument for authentic experience as opposed to canned prefab
experience. But, ironically, the film stubs its toe on that very
dichotomy. It has a homegrown look and texture, but what works for
a one-hour TV show doesn't necessarily work for a two-hour movie,
even with enlivening cameos from Little Richard as the pregame
anthem singer and Michael Myers as a TV sports color guy.
</P>
<P>
   When the hockey game finally unfolds, it grabs you despite its
conventional structuring and despite the fact that it's hard to
think of the Rangers as the bad guys of the NHL, much less of a
movie. Still, the game, with the Mystery players in their retro
jerseys suggesting the old Monteral Maroons, is the one thing that
somehow skates past an obvious Hollywood ending in what otherwise
seems like a screenful of too-obvious string-pulling, with rigged
emotional responses that undercut a few really good performances
and leave other performers stranded.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Crowe does a good job as the film's emotional center, a
town sheriff and hard-working family man facing up to the fact that
at 34 he's getting too old for the Saturday game of choose-up-sides
that amounts to the town's ritual of tribal approval and male
bonding. The film makes the dubious point that the guys who didn't
qualify _ Hank Azaria's local guy who left town to become the media
tout whose return amounts to delayed self-vindication and Burt
Reynolds's stuffy and disapproving local judge taking his own
youthful shortcomings out on his hockey-minded son _ are stunted
human beings.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Mystery, Alaska'' is too scattershot to really explore
these ideas, going broad when it should be going deep and never
supplying enough emotional faceting. Contrivance repeatedly
overwhelms character, wasting the likes of Colm Meaney as a
clueless mayor and Ron Eldard as a sleep-around whose philandering
is based on the town's neglect of its women. Given this, the women
are relegated to perfunctory contributions (I'd like to have seen
more of Mary McCormack's quietly heroic wife and mother), while
Crowe, Reynolds, and Azaria are underutilized.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Crowe is the moral and emotional anchor of the team,
it individually and collectively isn't a strong enough presence
when it should be the film's real center, although individual
performances _ Kevin Durand's gentle bull, for instance _ are
flavorful and simpatico. Too many wispy plot strands, in short, and
too little everything else is the story here. ``Mystery, Alaska''
stakes out some promising territory, and Kelley is obviously aware
that to make the move from TV to films he must fill his scripts
with greater depth and density. But he's not there yet.

`THREE KINGS' A WISE AND WITTY LOOK AT WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THREE KINGS 
Written and directed by: David O. Russell 
Starring: George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, Nora Dunn, Jamie
Kennedy, Mykelti Williamson, Cliff Curtis, Said Taghmaoui 
Running time: 111 minutes 
Rated: R (graphic war violence, language and some sexuality) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You walk into ``Three Kings'' expecting another wiseguy war
movie. You walk out amazed and refreshed by the way it kicks the
assumptions out from under the genre _ including the assumption
that the other side is faceless cannon fodder. While George
Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, and Ice Cube rightly will sell the tickets
as scamsters in uniform whose hearts prove bigger than their
larcenous impulses at the tail end of the 1991 Gulf War, the real
hero is David O. Russell. His barbed script and direction make you
realize how unexamined the war movie is. Usually it's so busy
celebrating the heroism of the combatants that it never gets around
to the larger political issues attached to this or that war.
``Three Kings'' has a strong enough sense of the absurd to tee off
on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three Kings'' is only Hollywood's second Gulf War-themed
movie, but it loses no time getting on the board with its view that
the war wasn't motivated by noble principle, but by no larger
vision than perceived economic expediency, and that it proceeded
with the same confusion and lack of overview as in Vietnam. No less
remarkably, it contains sympathetic Iraqis and allows them to be as
human as the GIs. It also reminds us that a lot of what happens
once the shooting starts is arbitrary, capricious, and
unpredictable. Yet for all of its maverick energies, ``Three
Kings'' never yields to cynicism, even though it begins in a
cynical vein, with a ``Kelly's Heroes''-like scheme by a few GIs to
steal some gold the Iraqis took from Kuwait, and give themselves a
golden parachute into civilian life.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the gold bugs never saw combat. As the film opens,
they're reservists celebrating the victorious end of the war at a
base behind the front lines. When Clooney's smart but jaded officer
on the verge of retirement hears that gold is buried in a nearby
village, he can't resist loading a few confederates into a Humvee,
assuming they need only do a little runout behind the enemy lines
and they'll all be rich and back in their tents by lunchtime. Of
course, it doesn't turn out that way. Although the war's outcome
has been settled, the shooting has hardly stopped. When Clooney and
the others get to the parched village and find not only the gold
bars but bunkers stuffed with loot ranging from computers to
Cuisinarts, they realize that a detachment of Saddam's Republican
Guard standing menacingly by is indifferent to the presence of the
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that the Republican Guard is there to kill Iraqi
rebels. Heartened by the hollow words of President Bush, the rebels
are ecstatic to see the GIs and think the soldiers have been sent
to help. But the rebels soon realize they've been hung out to dry
by the lack of US follow-through. It's fun to watch Clooney
struggle to suppress the remnants of his tattered idealism, stick
to his plan, drive out with the gold, and leave the rebels to die.
But the gold is so heavy that he needs the rebels to help transport
it. Next thing they know, they're exchanging gunfire with the
Republican Guard detachment and they're committed, cursing at the
complications that have arisen in what they thought would be
something as simple as knocking over an ATM. Instead, they're
huddled in a rebel sanctuary, plotting a counterattack, amusingly
made possible by a fleet of stolen stretch limos.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the cool of Clooney's veteran tested by the need to
satisfy conscience, stash the gold, and get back before they're all
declared AWOL; during a skirmish Wahlberg's simpatico reservist
from Detroit, who wants only to get back to his wife and kids, is
captured and tortured by Iraqis. The film doesn't mind reminding us
that the Iraqis were trained by the United States to fight the
Iraqi-Iran war, then turned that training against their own people,
Kuwait, and, briefly, us. The film's way of riding the fact that
the game plan changes with every new turn of circumstance peaks
when Wahlberg's resourceful prisoner plucks a cell phone from a
pile of stolen gear and phones his wife in Detroit, who in turn
phones his position in to headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clooney and the others, aided immensely by a warm
characterization from Ice Cube, keep the desert improvisations
coming, with Clooney's good-guy roguishness (reminiscent of his
charming thief in ``Out of Sight'') keeping the film tilted toward
impudent comic unpredictability. As if to guard against
prettification, Russell's camera drains color from the desert
settings, emphasizing the gritty harshness of the situation, which
ends on a satisfyingly pragmatic note and escapes the need for
ersatz moral epiphanies. If these GIs behave like good guys, it's
not because that's their first choice. ``Three Kings'' is a
resourceful and even witty film that irreverently reinvents the war
movie and ambitiously saves its best shots for military mythmaking
and the myopic lunges that sometimes pass for US foreign policy.
It's the ``M-A-S-H'' of the Gulf War.

`ANIMAL FARM': PEARL AMID THE SWINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
ANIMAL FARM 
Starring: Pete Postlethwaite, Alan Stanford 
Featuring the voices of: Kelsey Grammer, Ian Holm, Julia
Louis-Dreyfus, Julia Ormond, Paul Scofield, Patrick Stewart, Peter
Ustinov 
Directed by: John Stephenson 
On: TNT, Sunday at 8 p.m. 
Rated: TVPG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pigs who rule ``Animal Farm'' are ugly swine, with drooling
mouths, coarse fur, and snoots that glisten with slime. Despite the
Disneyization of animals in American entertainment, and despite the
``Babe'' cuddly quotient, they are stubbornly, convincingly, and
fascinatingly repugnant. You won't find these anti-worker porkers
stuffed on the shelves of your local toy store.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just what makes the new TNT production of George
Orwell's novel such a nice surprise. ``Animal Farm,'' which
premieres Sunday night at 8 on TNT, is a gritty, intelligent TV
movie that doesn't shy away from the dark symbolism of Orwell's
dystopian fable. It hasn't been softened for younger viewers, even
though its creators _ Jim Henson's Creature Shop and executive
producer Robert Halmi Sr. of ``Gulliver's Travels'' _ are generally
identified with family-oriented material. And it hasn't been wholly
dumbed down in the name of mainstream TV, although, like any book
adaptation, it nips and tucks at Orwell's original. ``Animal Farm''
is an adult movie that manages to capture a bleak totalitarian
nightmare, dropping into its new-boss-old-boss pessimism only a
dash of hope at the end.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Postlethwaite, whose angular face recalls a wooden puppet,
plays the negligent, drunken famer Jones. Tired of his abuse, the
animals stage a revolution and run Jones and his wife off the farm.
They set out to build an equal society, with idealistic approaches
to wealth and production and with a neat slogan: ``Four legs good,
two legs bad.'' But greed and power undo the utopia, and the ruling
pigs _ the Stalinesque Napoleon, in particular _ become drunken,
oppressive, murderous dictators who are no better than their human
predecesors. ``Animal Farm'' is famous as an Orwellian critique of
Stalinist Russia, but the movie works as a potent parable even
without its historical associations.
</P>
<P>
   The voice cast is loaded with formidable names like Ian Holm,
Paul Scofield, Peter Ustinov, Kelsey Grammer, and Patrick Stewart,
who is the nefarious Napoleon. But, except for Julia Louis-Dreyfus'
cameo as the vain horse Mollie, their performances don't take
attention away from the unfolding story. Halmi's TV movies
sometimes play as if they were designed as a string of episodic
star turns, but the spell of ``Animal Farm'' is rarely broken. The
only flaw may be Julia Ormond's Jesse, a noble sheepdog whose
kindly voice is slightly out of sync with the story's somber tones.
</P>
<P>
   Visually, the production is absolutely remarkable. It's amazing
how today's technical filmmakers can merge live-action,
animatronics, and digital effects to create a seamless vision of
animal life. After a few minutes at Manor Farm, which the animals
rename Animal Farm, you forget the artificiality of the whole
venture, and you stop noticing how the lips move on the pigs and
horses and dogs. The movie also features haunting pig-made
propaganda films that recall those of the Third Reich.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most imaginatively shot scenes in ``Animal House''
has Jesse spying on Napoleon and his goons as they slurp whiskey in
the farmhouse with a human. Through the glass, all of their faces
look identical.

REMAINS OF THE DAY HAUNT A BILLIONAIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Internet billionaire David Wetherell, a funny thing happened
on the way to building his personal high-tech Xanadu. Well, maybe
not so funny from Wetherell's point of view.
</P>
<P>
   All Wetherell, whose net worth has been pegged at $3 billion,
wanted to do was build a garden-variety, 7,400-square-foot palace
on a 10-acre plot of land in Martha's Vineyard. The Squibnocket
site is one of the most beautiful in the Commonwealth, with a
commanding view of such Vineyard landmarks as Nomans Land island,
the estate of the late Jacqueline Onassis, and Gay Head Light.
</P>
<P>
   The trophy home, created by architect Glen Fries of Princeton,
N.J., has what I call a Longest Day design: each of the two wings
resembles a Quonset hut, and they are linked by a circular stone
tower in the middle. Says our Squibnocket stringer: ``The overall
impression one gets, coming over the hill, is that you've stumbled
upon a nicely shingled German bunker overlooking the bluffs of
Omaha Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it has the appropriate Web-mogul accoutrements: a
negative-edge swimming pool like you see in the cigarette ads; a
12-seat basement theater that alas has some soundproofing
``concerns'' (you can hear the furnace when it's on), and a litter
of expensive, German-made digital TVs strewn throughout the rooms.
It's a so-called smart house, ``which means you have to be an
Einstein to turn on the lights,'' according to my source.
</P>
<P>
   Started in 1996, the mansion is still unfinished, although
Wetherell and his family did spend part of this summer in the
mostly complete residential wing. Some of the delays derive from
the usual reasons _ you can appreciate how hard it is to get
kitchen tiles from France, and huge, custom-built arches from
Pennsylvania, for the Great Hall _ but the biggest problem has been
. . . the remains.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's every billionaire's nightmare. In December 1997
archeologists discovered what the Vineyard Gazette said ``may be
one of the most significant archeological finds in New England'' _
a ceremonial Native American burial ground, and surrounding
dwellings. The Vineyard-based Wampanoag tribe and state historical
officials imposed a news blackout concerning the find, and posted a
guard at the site.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 and 1999, Wetherell had to pay for a team of
archeologists to live and work on his property while the house was
being built. Their report should be filed soon. I'm told they
identified the remains of two adults and three children,
``post-contact,'' which is archeology-speak for the period
following the European invasion of North America. State
archeologist Brona Simon confirms that the find doesn't live up to
its inital hype: ``It's an interesting site, but not one of the
best discoveries made in New England.''
</P>
<P>
   So where does that leave Wetherell? While on the Vineyard this
summer, he sat down for a major powwow with Wampanoag tribal
chairwoman Beverly Wright. I'm told that he and the Wampanoags
reached a settlement _ not a financial settlement, Simon says _
that will ensure that no construction will take place near the
burial area. (There goes the guest house . . .) According to Simon,
``The majority of the archeological site is to be preserved in
perpetuity.'' Wetherell declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of mine received an elegant, three-page ``invitation''
to join a new country club called Whisper Hill. It hypes itself as
``a secluded, private club with membership limited to less than
three hundred.'' The club offers complimentary guest suites, free
golf clubs, an exercise facility, spa, ``and gourmet dining
complimented (sic) by your personal wine cellar.'' And it's not
built on top of an Indian burial ground!
</P>
<P>
   Sounds great, but . . . where is it? Nowhere does the mailing
disclose the location of this rare gem. It turns out to be in New
Ipswich, N.H., a few miles north of the Massachusetts border on
Route 124. Why hide the location of the property you're trying to
sell people on?
</P>
<P>
   ``Clever, isn't it?'' says membership director Rob Stroud.
Subsequent mailings have revealed the club's location in the cover
letter, he says. ``The first ones were a little vague in that
area.''

GLUE OR NAIL BACK SHINGLE SLIVER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, September 03, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. A sliver of cedar shingle came off my house siding. It is 1
1/2 inches wide and 16 inches long. Can I glue it back?
</P>
<P>
   A.B., Brighton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Of course. To reglue, use an adhesive caulk of a type that
comes in a caulking cartridge. Or, nail it if you predrill the nail
hole. A sliver like that is a little narrow for safe nailing; you
could split the shingle again. Use a galvanized shingle nail and
nail near the butt of the shingle above. Touch up paint if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I had to replace the floor of the second-story porch of an
1890 Victorian, which is covered by a roof. It had a painted canvas
floor that was removed, and now there is new plywood and tarpaper
on top. What can I use?
</P>
<P>
   MICHAEL MILBURN, Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The Yellow Pages reveal nothing about canvas floors. So, use
fir porch flooring. The boards are tongued and grooved, and if
painted, are quite watertight. Apply one coat of semitransparent
stain instead of paint.
</P>
<P>
   Or put down 2 x 4 sleepers, then spaced pressure-treated deck
boards; water will drain between the boards and run down the
tarpaper roof to the edge, out of harm's way. The extra weight of
the sleepers will make very little difference.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have some fine old pine trees, 75 feet high. English ivy is
growing up them, up about eight feet now. Will they hurt the tree,
or twine around it? Should I cut off the ivy or cut it down, or
what should I do?
</P>
<P>
   TONY BASS, Norfolk, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The ivy is competing with the trees for air and sun, but it
is not the twining type that girdles trunks and branches, and will
not choke the trees.
</P>
<P>
   The handyman checked with two know-ledgeable plant people, and
got two answers. One suggested keeping the ivy in control by
cutting it at a certain height, say, six feet, and letting it
continue until it's high enough to cut again. The other suggested
something more drastic: Cut the ivy at the ground and keep it
short.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, you will have your ivy and your pines. In my
opinion, the pines are far more important than the ivy.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My central air system has been in place for four years. Now,
every time it comes on it keeps tripping the circuit breaker.
What's wrong, and how can I fix it?
</P>
<P>
   GETTING TOO WARM
</P>
<P>
   A. The compressor is pulling more power than it normally does,
tripping the breaker every time. I think the unit needs an overhaul
or at least routine maintenance, perhaps replacement of parts. Call
the installer to do this work.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have several swollen doors in my house due to moisture
gain. Some are so tight that they take a lot of effort to close.
Normally I leave all the doors open in summer, but one house guest
needs privacy, which isn't so good because the doors won't shut
without effort. Is there anything I can do to make them close and
open properly without planing the edges? I am reluctant to plane
the edges because in winter, when the doors dry out and contract,
the gaps may be too wide.
</P>
<P>
   E.O., Wellesley, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The only thing you could do without planing the doors is to
rebuild the frame in the opening, to accommodate the expanded
doors. I don't even want to think of that, because it involves a
lot of unnecessary work. Planing the door edges a bit will make
them fit, and when they dry out and contract, it is unlikely that
the gaps will be intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   You should paint the edges where you planed the wood. This is
good, because when the doors contract in autumn, you can repaint or
revarnish the entire door, including top and bottom edges. This
will seal the doors, keeping out future moisture and the doors
stable.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I received several bids to reroof my Colonial house that
needs 22 squares of shingles (22 squares equal 2,200 square feet).
The bids range from $3,200 to $4,000; add $1,800 to $2,000 for
stripping the one layer of shingles already on the house. Is this
fair? The bids include a ridge vent. One roofer suggested putting
Ice &AMP; Water Shield over the old shingles. Is that acceptable?
</P>
<P>
   PAT DELEO, Reading, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Everything is good except the idea of the Ice &AMP; Water Shield
going on top of the old shingles. The Ice &AMP; Water Shield is a
rubberized membrane that goes along the bottom 3 to 6 feet of the
roof at the eaves, and is designed to prevent leaks from ice dams.
The Ice &AMP; Water Shield should go on top of bare sheathing. It will
do its job better if it is done this way.
</P>
<P>
   The bids sound reasonable; in fact, $3,200 to $4,000 for 22
squares of shingles is a good buy. The stripping costs seem high,
too, but I don't think you will do much better. If the job includes
installation of a ridge vent, that is another good deal because a
ridge vent costs $10 per foot. The soffit vents at $400 also sound
fair, depending on the size of the house.
</P>

IT'S MOSTLY BAD NEWS FOR THE POOREST PEOPLE ON THE PLANET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Human nature being what it is, the hawkers of news prosper more
off what arouses the customer than that which accurately informs.
</P>
<P>
   That's why you get more sizzle than steak, particularly when
matters ``foreign'' are addressed. Pictures of a boy dragged from
the earthquake's rubble or a riot squad in action are more
compelling than footage of some middle-aged bureaucrat rattling on
about poverty statistics. But today we're holding the sizzle and
serving you steak, in the form of speeches made in Washington this
week before the annual meeting of the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund, two outfits which have become punching
bags for a lot of people who are convinced they know what's wrong
with the planet.
</P>
<P>
   What is really going on here on Spaceship Earth?
</P>
<P>
   Some good things: Life expectancy, on average, has gone up more
in the last 40 years than in the previous 4,000. The Internet means
near-universal access to information. Then there are the
not-so-good trends, World Bank chief James Wolfensohn said Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
   ``Per-capita incomes which will stagnate or decline this year in
all regions except East and South Asia . . . with the exception of
China, 100 million more people living in poverty today than a
decade ago. In at least 10 countries in Africa, the scourge of AIDS
has reduced life expectancy by 17 years. More than 33 million cases
of AIDS in the world, of which 22 million are in Africa. Some 1.5
billion people still lacking access to safe water and 2.4 million
children who die each year of waterborne diseases. Some 125 million
children still not in primary school . . . A world where the
information gap is widening. And the forests are being destroyed at
the rate of an acre a second.''
</P>
<P>
   These statistics are almost impossible to believe. In the time
it takes to sneeze, three acres of forest are burned. And
everything revolves around money. It is poverty which holds half of
mankind in chains.
</P>
<P>
   Next month the planet's ridership surpasses 6 billion human
beings. How do they live now? Half of humanity gets along on the
euipvalent of $2 a day, or less. Half of that half lives on less
than $1 a day. When a child born today reaches the age of 25, there
will be 2 billion additional people, fighting for air, water, food,
space, roofs, jobs, schooling, roads, sewers, farmland. Only
development will spare them a life of perilous poverty.
</P>
<P>
   As the earthling more responsible than any single individual,
perhaps even more obligated than the president of the United
States, for the well-being of mankind, and the development of
economic structures to make mankind's future more secure,
Wolfensohn asked: ``What have we learned about development?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have learned that development is possible but not
inevitable, that growth is essential but not sufficient to ensure
poverty reduction.'' And it is essential to help poor people with
local institutions, controlled by them, insulated against the
corruption, both petty and grand, that turns so many cops and
bureaucrats in poor countries into petty despots or grand thieves
on the scale of the Baligate thieves who sacked the treasury of
Indonesia and pitched the world's fourth-largest nation into
anarchy.
</P>
<P>
   He quoted from a massive World Bank study, ``Voices of the
Poor,'' distilled from 60,000 poor people in 60 countries:
``Poverty is much more than a matter of income alone. The poor seek
a sense of well-being _ which is peace of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's the bulletin: The poor of the planet are just like us
cozy Americans. What they want is what we've got! ``It is good
health, community, and safety. It is choice, and freedom, as well
as a steady source of income.'' He quoted the old African woman:
``to live in love without hunger;'' the Eastern European survivor
of communism: ``to be well is to know what will happen to me
tomorrow;'' the mother in Southeast Asia: ``When my child asks for
something to eat, I say the rice is cooking until he falls asleep
from hunger. For there is no rice.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after Wolfensohn laid out the challenge, President
Clinton showed up to announce cancellation of that portion of the
debt owed the United States by 36 of the poorest countries which
had not already been forgiven. The pope and a number of celebrities
had been agitating for debt forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration had already written off about 90
percent of that debt, and this final write-off of what once totaled
nearly $6 billion will encourage the campaigners of Jubilee 2000 to
press other lender nations to follow suit. Clinton has been a very
good president, all things considered, for the poorer people of the
planet. He alluded to the high-priced lobbying that goes on in the
jousting between agricultural haves to carve out more elbow room at
the trough of market share: ``Because we want to fight over who
sells the most food . . . are we supposed to accept the fact that
nearly 40 million people a year die of hunger? That's nearly equal
to the number of all the people killed in World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   He had more good lines, such as ``the wealth of nations depends
upon the health of nations.'' But you get the idea. We rich nations
are our brother's keeper; sister's too.

SILICON VALLEY EXECUTIVES ANTE UP TO BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDWOOD CITY, Calif. _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush took his
money-raising juggernaut to the Silicon Valley, courting votes and
adding more technology-borne wealth to his campaign for the
Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the front-runner for the Republican nomination went
to the valley and vacuumed up another $350,000 at a fund-raiser at
the Hotel Sofitel in Redwood City.
</P>
<P>
   For the technology-heavy crowd, there was discount pricing: $500
for guests under age 35, $1,000 for those over 35. Never mind that
some of the younger executives and entrepreneurs in the crowd could
well afford the higher rate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's swing through the Silicon Valley, which included a stop
at the Tech Museum in San Jose, came on the same day his campaign
reported that he had raised $19 million in the past three months,
six times as much as his nearest GOP competitor, Sen. John McCain
of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   And the Texas governor reported close to $37 million in the
bank, more than his Democratic and Republican contenders have
combined.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been especially doting in his courtship of Silicon
Valley's technology leaders. Technet, the lobbying group, released
a list of 120 prominent Silicon Valley supporters who have endorsed
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   At the fund-raiser, Bush once again bashed the Clinton
administration for being slow to support legislation to limit
product liability lawsuits related to Y2K-related computer
breakdowns. He said he would have acted faster than the
administration to ease regulations on the export of encryption
technology and to make the research and development tax credit
permanent _ both big issues with technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will always take the side of innovation over litigation, and
private initiative over federal regulation,'' he said. The
suit-and-tie crowd responded with strong applause.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush will have to fight hard for support in the valley.
</P>
<P>
   Many top tech leaders backed the Clinton-Gore team in the last
two presidential elections, and former Sen. Bill Bradley of New
Jersey has surprised some recently by raising huge sums of money
from Democrats in the Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are divisions within the tech community,'' said Kathy
Behrens, a leading venture capitalist and Bush supporter. ``There
is good support for Bush, there is good support for Bradley and
there is good support for Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one longtime Democratic supporter said Thursday he is
switching his support to Bush. Halsey Minor, the chairman of CNET,
held a $50,000-per-person fund-raiser for the Democratic National
Committee in September 1997. Clinton attended the event at Minor's
Sea Cliff mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Minor said he is drawn to Bush's message of compassionate
conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Gore has definitely been good for the (technology)
industry and I'm fairly confident that Bush will be equally good
for the industry. In Internet parlance, he gets it,'' Minor said.
</P>
<P>
   But Minor, who describes himself as fiscally conservative and
socially liberal, said he has ``fiscal concerns with Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're both socially compassionate, but I think Bush
is more fiscally conservative. And I just think we've got a good
thing going right now,'' Minor said. ``We don't need to screw it
up.''

 &HT;    CHINA PARADES ITS NUCLEAR MISSILES THROUGH TIANANMEN SQUARE
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service (at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China put its arsenal of nuclear missiles on parade
for only the second time in its history Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The rare show of thermonuclear hardware was the crowning moment
of a day of pageantry and power in which more than 500,000
carefully chosen patriots celebrated the 50th anniversary of the
People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
   This largest display of Communist China's military brawn carried
a twofold message.
</P>
<P>
   One had a domestic audience, pumping a strong infusion of
patriotism into a population at loose ideological ends without an
anchoring set of national values. With no clear political blueprint
to follow, pride and love of motherland are pitched as the national
glue.
</P>
<P>
   The second target seemed to lie 90 miles away on Taiwan, whose
leaders have this year inched themselves to the verge of declaring
the island an independent state.
</P>
<P>
   Each major utterance from mainland China's officials over these
celebratory days has warned Taiwan of the folly of making a final
declaration of independence and expressed confidence that the
Chinese of Taipei soon will be reunited under the single rule of
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   As China's leaders watched the troops from atop the Gate of
Heavenly Peace Friday, rocket forces paraded three types of
nuclear-capable missiles through Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   The most powerful weapon on display was China's new three-stage
Dongfeng-31, a mobile solid-fueled ballistic missile capable of
landing a nuclear warhead up to 5,000 miles away in Hawaii, Alaska
or parts of the state of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Tractor-trailer trucks slowly hauled three Dongfeng-31s, each
encased in a heavy khaki-colored metal tube, past the reviewing
stands. They were the last weapons to appear in the half-hour
military parade of 11,000 troops that also featured tanks,
self-propelled cannons, Marine commandos, goose-stepping honor
guards and a fly-over by 132 warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   After successfully flight-testing the Dongfeng-31 in August,
China is expected to begin deploying 20 to 30 of the missiles next
year. Unlike previous Chinese fixed-site ICBMs, these will be
difficult to target because they are mobile.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer's report by the U.S. congressional Cox Committee
alleged that the Dongfeng-31 rocket will exploit nuclear warhead
technology stolen from the United States through espionage. But
China has issued a blanket denial.
</P>
<P>
   The two other types of nuclear rockets in the parade, the
Dongfeng-11 and Dongfeng-15, were short-range ballistic missiles.
With a 250-mile range, they are mainly capable of striking Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Beaming down on the parade from the Gate of Heavenly Peace was
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, 71, who has used the weeklong 50th
anniversary observance to consolidate his stature as China's
paramount leader.
</P>
<P>
   Six years after Jiang took over as China's head of state, a
giant poster showing his picture was carried in a national day
parade for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang had finally attained sufficient power within the ruling
Communist Party politburo to claim equal billing with communist
China's founder, the late Mao Tse-tung, and the initiator of its
market reform era, the late Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Practice has fully proved that socialism is the only way to
save and develop China,'' said Jiang, wearing a gray Mao suit as he
addressed a throng that included paratroopers, flower-waving
scientists, newlyweds in wedding clothes and a two-year-old girl in
a baby carriage chanting ``Long Live the Motherland.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese historians insist that the world's first military parade
took place in China more than 4,000 years ago, when a Chinese
chieftain named Yu gathered soldiers from tribes across China for
marching, music and songs.
</P>
<P>
   Soviet-style martial displays were an annual event in China
throughout the 1950s. But this was only the second military parade
in Tiananmen Square in the last four decades, according to the
state-run Xinhua news agency.
</P>
<P>
   The last such military parade took place in 1984, when Deng
Xiaoping was consolidating his power six years after the death of
Chairman Mao Tse-tung. It was during the 1984 parade that China
showed off its nuclear missiles for the first time.

   Cheeky monkeys that attack tourists in a Japanese national park
and raid local farms are in for a shock. To reinstill a fear of
people among the animals, local government officials want to give
them electric shocks. But one of the country's leading
primatologists has warned that the plan may be seriously flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, thousands of tourists flock to Nikko National Park
in Tochigi prefecture, northeast of Tokyo. Nikko is the home of the
famous ''Hear No Evil, See No Evil, Speak No Evil'' monkey
sculpture at the Tosho-Go Shrine.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there has been an increasing number of incidents
where wild monkeys have literally bitten the hands of the tourists
who feed them. The monkeys also rampage across fields of nearby
farms and eat crops.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, it was possible to shoot the monkeys, but this was
banned two years ago. Now local officials in Nikko have decided to
embark on a new plan of intimidation. They propose a two-hour
session of shock treatment for any monkeys that they catch, after
which the animals are released back into the wild, where the
authorities also intend to frighten them with fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Tochigi prefectural government says that an
expert from Utsunomiya University has been consulted on the
proposed measures. But the spokesman was unable to give details,
nor could he say exactly how many volts would be used.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Yomiuri newspaper, the director of the
prefectural government's forestry office, Masaharu Fukuda,
describes the plan as the best possible way to drive the animals
back to the mountains without shooting them. ''Although I do feel a
little sorry for the monkeys,'' he admits.
</P>
<P>
   But Tetsuro Matsuzawa, a psychologist at Kyoto University's
Primate Research Institute, warns that the new policy is unlikely
to be effective and could end up deeply traumatizing the monkeys.
''Whether this is legal or ethical is another matter,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Matsuzawa points out that to assess the effectiveness of the
measures, the officials need a control group which is not given
shocks. ''Then you can release both groups into the wild to see if
one has a greater aversion towards humans,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Matsuzawa has also confronted the problem of marauding monkeys.
The technique he has developed is a version of the behavioral
therapy described in Anthony Burgess's novel ''A Clockwork
Orange,'' modified for simian subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Matsuzawa and his colleagues injected monkeys with drugs so they
felt slightly nauseated, then gave them food such as apples that
they often steal from farms. The monkeys began to feel sick after
their meal and learned to associate the feeling with what they had
eaten. ''We were partially successful in making them averse to
these foods,'' Matsuzawa reports. &QL;

   A robotic caterpillar designed to listen for survivors trapped
deep inside wrecked buildings has been built by students in North
Carolina. The robot _ powered by compressed air _ would crawl
through gas, water and sewerage pipes inside buildings damaged by
earthquakes and explosions, listening for signs of life.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Grant, an electrical engineer at North Carolina State
University, hatched the idea of a pipe-crawling rescue robot
following the bomb that destroyed a government building in Oklahoma
City in April 1995. ''The rescuers would have given anything to
have a robot that could go in and find people,'' Grant says. ''I
realized that pipes are a natural channel into the rubble.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant and his colleague John Muth challenged six of their senior
engineering students to build a prototype 15 centimeters wide.
''They took a crazy idea of mine,'' Grant says, ''and turned it
into a robust and interesting device.'' The result, a
three-segment, meter-long creature dubbed Moccasin II, which runs
on compressed air to avoid igniting any escaping gas.
</P>
<P>
   To advance, Moccasin inflates four pneumatic pads that wedge the
front segment into the pipe. The middle section then pulls the rear
segment forward. The rear segment then anchors itself, the front
releases its grip, and the middle section shoves it forward. ''It's
a simple concept,'' Grant says, ''but very effective.'' Tests
carried out in 15-centimeter pipes _ a common width for service
pipes in the United States _ showed the robot could successfully
navigate multiple 90-degree bends.
</P>
<P>
   The robot is equipped with lights and a video camera so its
progress can be monitored. Microphones will pick up sounds from
survivors. &QL;   &QL;

OIL FROM BUSH CAN COMBAT MOSQUITOS

   An ornamental bush prized by gardeners in Europe and the United
States contains a surprise weapon against the mosquitoes spreading
West Nile virus, the brain disease that has broken out in New York.
The bush might also provide a cheap way for the world's poorest
countries to fight filariasis, a disfiguring parasitic disease that
affects 15 million people in Africa alone.
</P>
<P>
   Oil from the summer cypress, better known as the burning bush
because it blushes a deep red in autumn, contains a substance
which, when converted into a pheromone, can be used to lure
mosquitoes to their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers could have used this trick to combat the mosquitoes
spreading the West Nile virus. The virus attacks the central
nervous system and sometimes leading to death. More than a hundred
suspected cases are being investigated by New York health officials
who are fighting the outbreak by killing mosquitoes with
conventional sprays of the powerful insecticides malathion and
pyrethroid.
</P>
<P>
   Burning bush oil might have provided a more benign solution.
Researchers from Britain and Nieria have turned oil from the
plant's seeds into a pheromone. This biological messenger, which is
odorless to humans, could lure female mosquitoes away from the
places where people live.
</P>
<P>
   A team from the Rothamsted site of the Institute of Arable Crops
Research in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, struck lucky when team leader
John Pickett noticed that the burning bush makes a fatty acid
strikingly similar to the pheromone that attracts the mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   The pheromone is produced naturally when rafts of eggs are laid
in stagnant water by Culex quinquefasciatus, the mosquito species
which spreads filariasis and is suspected of spreading West Nile
virus. ''It's a cue for other female mosquitoes, telling them that
there's a safe place where they can lay their eggs,'' says Mike
Birkett, a member of the Rothamsted team.
</P>
<P>
   The pheromone from the burning bush could have been used in New
York to lure mosquitoes to their death in drums of water laced with
pesticide, says Birkett. Pickett is confident that the pheromone
attracts females of all Culex species.
</P>
<P>
   The team at Rothamsted has tested synthetic versions of the same
pheromone, called (5R,6S)-6-acetoxy-5-hexadecanolide. ''It's been
tested in field trials in Africa, Japan and the United States, and
it works every time,'' says Birkett. The problem is that the
synthetic version is too expensive to manufacture. So instead, the
team screened plants for substances which could be turned into the
pheromone much more cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't need to be purified from the oil, making it cheap and
easy to handle. When Jenny Mordue of the University of Aberdeen
tested the oil-based pheromone in the laboratory, she found that it
attracted female mosquitoes as powerfully as the natural
substance. &QL;

   Americans need to ``keep our focus on health, not just health
care ... to deal with people in the dawn of life, noon and the
evening of life,'' Bradley said at the gathering on Thur{day.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Tom, 51, of Fairfield said she has 13 children, two of her
own and 11 who were adopted. The adopted children each have special
needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of them was relinquished (by the parents) because this was
the only way for their medical needs to be met, because it
impoverished the family,'' she said. ``The only way for this child
to get medical care was to be adopted. That's a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom said that while insurance covers most medical needs, it
doesn't cover other things such as liquid food, which costs up to
$10 per day.
</P>
<P>
   ``With chronic illnesses, I think the program should be stepped
up ... here any child with chronic, genetic illness would be fully
covered,'' Tom said. ``It should be a basic right in this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley told her that his plan would deal with children who need
more than normal care.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the group at Oakland suggested that Bradley's plan
include an increase in mental health coverage and provide universal
coverage for older teen-agers as well as children.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's proposal would provide all Americans access to health
insurance by extending the federal workers' health-care system to
non-employees and providing tax credits to help people pay for
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would mandate coverage for all children. Health care
for children living in households with an income of less than
$32,800 for a family of four would be subsidized by the government.
A partial payment would be offered for families with up to $49,200
for a family of four.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley would use the budget surplus to pay for the program, but
not dip into funds set aside for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, Bradley's rival for the Democratic
nomination, has blasted Bradley's plan, calling it too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan offers overblown promises that would endanger
Medicare,'' Gore campaign spokesman Roger Salazar said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While the question remains whether Bradley's proposal would ever
become reality, some in the health care industry say it's good that
the issue is coming back around as part of a national debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hearing political leaders talk about universal coverage for
children is terrific,'' said Gregg Haifley, deputy director of the
health division at Children's Defense Fund in Washington, D.C. ``We
have 11 million uninsured kids in America. What we have to face up
to is the fact that if they don't have health insurance, they're
going to have health conditions that are going to go undiagnosed
and untreated. ... It's going to come back to haunt us later on.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, some 45 million Americans lack health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the industry questioned how parents, especially those
receiving only partial subsidy, would be held accountable for
enrolling their children in a health plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley's proposal is interesting. It's nice to say parents
should buy health insurance for kids, but I don't know how you can
enforce that,'' said Walter Zelman, president and chief executive
of the California Association of Health Plans, which represents
providers of managed care.
</P>
<P>
   Zelman was not surprised that the health care debate is quickly
picking up steam just before an election year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem hasn't gone away. It's a glaring, glaring
problem,'' said Zelman, who was one of the advisers to President
Clinton's failed effort to provide universal health care in 1994.

   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA _ MOSCOW _ The Russian government Friday came
under increasing pressure at home and abroad to avoid a full-scale
war in Chechnya, even as warplanes pressed their assault on the
breakaway republic and ground forces made limited incursions across
the border.In a policy address at Harvard, Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott Friday will urge the Kremlin to show
restraint. So, too, are the Russian media. While Russia's 10-day
air campaign against Chechnya has won approval from the majority of
the public, a ground invasion conjures painful memories of Russia's
disastrous war in the republic from 1994 to 1996. An editorial in a
leading Russian daily said Friday: ``With our poverty, we soon
might face the same thing we faced some time ago _ shame and new
coffins. But the problem now is there is no money even for the
coffins.'' (Holmes, Cox News Service).

<P>
   Truly, her living was not in vain.
</P>
<P>
   In life, Oseola McCarty provided resplendent evidence of the
enormous capacity for goodness that exists in the hearts and minds
of human beings and the amazing power of humility and selflessness.
</P>
<P>
   Her great humanitarian gesture calls to mind Alma Bazel
Androzzo's inspirational song, as rendered by the inimitable Mr. B.
_ Billy Eckstine:
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can help somebody as I pass along. If I can cheer
somebody with a word or a song.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarty, who died on Sunday at age 91, was a Hattiesburg, Miss.,
resident who four years ago donated $150,000 _ almost her entire
life savings _ to the University of Southern Mississippi for
scholarships for needy students.
</P>
<P>
   That would have been a remarkable thing if McCarty had been an
affluent professional or entrepreneur, some economically successful
person who wished to give something back to society.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can show somebody he is traveling wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCarty had accumulated her entire small fortune from
washing and ironing other people's clothes in her home. And that
circumstance elevated her giving to a higher plane than any
multimillionaire's philanthropic gesture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then my living will not be in vain.''
</P>
<P>
   She did not seek the honors that came her way. She was a humble
person and did not long for fame. The self-effacing washerwoman who
had outlived all her relatives gave the money to the university,
she said, ``so that the children won't have to work so hard, like I
did.''
</P>
<P>
   But the awards came, more than 300 of them. She shook hands with
the president of the United States and received the Presidential
Citizens Medal. Harvard University bestowed an honorary doctorate
upon her.
</P>
<P>
   McCarty carried the Olympic torch on a short stretch of its
journey through Mississippi. And at the stroke of midnight on Dec.
31, 1996, she flicked the switch that released the giant
illuminated ball that climaxes the New Year's Eve celebration in
New York City's Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   None of that overawed her. She remained the same God-fearing
person, the washerwoman, the servant to her fellow human beings
whose humility and graciousness called to mind Christ washing the
feet of his disciples.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest reward to come to McCarty for her largess
was the imitation that it stimulated. The fund she established at
Southern Mississippi has been more than doubled by the
contributions of 600 additional donors. Her gift is said to have
inspired communications tycoon Ted Turner to contribute $1 billion
to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bill Gates has not made the connection, it is
reasonable to assume that McCarty's philanthropy may have
indirectly influenced his recent decision to establish a $1 billion
scholarship fund for minority students.
</P>
<P>
   But she didn't give that money to the school to start something
bigger. She just gave what she could, which is all that can be
reasonably expected of anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can do my duty as a good man ought. If I can bring back
beauty to a world upwrought.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarty's gift is a valuable testimonial for millions of
Americans caught up in the chase for material success, the swirl of
changing values, the maelstrom of social and political conflict,
and the anguish of existential uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Her example suggests that in the grand scheme of things, none of
that matters if one derives no real satisfaction from attaining
wealth, power or prestige.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing that she had only a short time left to live, McCarty
reaffirmed the ancient wisdom that all you can take with you is the
good that you've done and what you give away.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can spread love's message that the Master taught.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarty, who lived nearly a century in southern Mississippi,
through the worst days of brutalizing segregation and
discrimination against her people, endured it all and kept her
faith in God and mankind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then my living will not be in vain.''
</P>
<P>
   Oseola McCarty was a credit to her race. The human race.

 (DUPLICATION ALERT: Story also moving as

(For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is a muscular, broad-shouldered youth with a biblical name.
He admits to having had his troubles before returning to his
Christian faith.
</P>
<P>
   But now Jeremiah Neitz (pronounced ``nights'') is receiving
nationwide attention because he stood up during the horrendous
shootings at Wedgwood Baptist Church on Sept. 15 and boldly told
the killer he needed Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept saying that Christianity was B.S.,'' Neitz said this
week. ``So I stood up and told him, `Sir, what you need is Jesus
Christ.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Then Larry Gene Ashbrook pointed his gun at Neitz and yelled an
expletive at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I held my hands up to my side and said, `Sir, you can shoot me
if you want. But I know where I'm going. I'm going to heaven. What
about you?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Then Ashbrook shouted the expletive again, put the gun to his
head and took his own life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't anything to do with me; it was all God,'' Neitz
said.
</P>
<P>
   Neitz, 19, spoke from the same pew at Wedgwood Baptist where he
had sat with his head down, praying, as Ashbrook shot and killed
seven people and injured seven others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just praying to God to let this end,'' Neitz said.
</P>
<P>
   His youth minister, Adam Hammond, who was under a pew behind
Neitz covered in blood from one of the slain people, kept tugging
at Neitz's pants leg trying to get him to lie on the floor like
everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   But Neitz, one of several young people from Southwayside Baptist
Church attending the youth rally, stayed seated, face in his hands,
praying. For some inexplicable reason he jumped to his feet and
confronted Ashbrook when the man began cursing Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Beth Talley, 17, who was wounded as she risked her life by
holding down a distraught teen-ager who was trying to stand up
during the gunfire, said she heard Neitz confronting the shooter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard him say, `What you need is Jesus Christ,' and I
prayed, `Father please protect him,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hammond said he believes Neitz's actions in challenging Ashbrook
with a message of faith may have been the reason he quit shooting
so abruptly. He still had several clips of ammunition stuffed in
his pockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``God's fingerprints are all over what happened here,'' Hammond
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the shooting, Neitz has been interviewed on national
television and by publications such as ``People'' magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Neitz doesn't take any credit, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I think it was God,'' he said. ``God had control of
everything that was going on here that night.''
</P>
<P>
   Neitz doesn't have a good answer about why he stood up to face
Ashbrook.
</P>
<P>
   ``This might sound weird,'' he said, ``but I knew he would not
shoot me.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether he likes it or not, Neitz has become one of the young
people hailed because they were willing to stand up for their faith
in the face of death.
</P>
<P>
   Some evangelicals have emphasized the example of Cassie Bernall,
a 17-year-old Columbine High School school student who was killed
April 20 after the attackers reportedly asked whether she believed
in God and she answered, ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent reports in the Rocky Mountain News, The Denver Post and
an online magazine, Salon, quote another student, Val Schnurr, and
witnesses as saying it was actually Schnurr who made that
statement.
</P>
<P>
   But Bernall's mother, Misty Bernall, who has written a
fast-selling book, ``She Said Yes: The Unlikely Martyrdom of Cassie
Bernall,'' said in a statement issued by her publisher, Plough
Publishing House, that several witnesses verified her daughter's
affirmation of faith.
</P>
<P>
   In her book, Bernall says her daughter went through a troubling
period of adolescent rebellion. But, she said, when Cassie found a
deeper faith at a summer youth camp, it transformed her into a
happy, smiling teen with the courage to face life, and death.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Scott, the father of Rachel Scott, another Christian
teen killed at Columbine, spoke at Westminster Presbyterian Church
in Fort Worth this week in a program attended by many young people
from Wedgwood Baptist. He believes his daughter was killed because
she refused to deny her faith.
</P>
<P>
   Neitz says all people, young and old alike, have to stand for
something.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's good that Cassie Bernall stood up for her
faith,'' he said. ``I think everybody should stand up for their
faith and everybody should live for God.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he professed faith at Southwayside Baptist when he was
14, Neitz said, he strayed and did not return to the church until
about six months ago. At that time he contacted Hammond, the youth

`IT WAS ALL GOD,' SAYS TEEN WHO DEFIED CHURCH GUNMAN

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is a muscular, broad-shouldered youth with a biblical name.
He admits to having had his troubles before returning to his
Christian faith.
</P>
<P>
   But now Jeremiah Neitz (pronounced ``nights'') is receiving
nationwide attention because he stood up during the horrendous
shootings at Wedgwood Baptist Church on Sept. 15 and boldly told
the killer he needed Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept saying that Christianity was B.S.,'' Neitz said this
week. ``So I stood up and told him, `Sir, what you need is Jesus
Christ.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Then Larry Gene Ashbrook pointed his gun at Neitz and yelled an
expletive at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I held my hands up to my side and said, `Sir, you can shoot me
if you want. But I know where I'm going. I'm going to heaven. What
about you?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Then Ashbrook shouted the expletive again, put the gun to his
head and took his own life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't anything to do with me; it was all God,'' Neitz
said.
</P>
<P>
   Neitz, 19, spoke from the same pew at Wedgwood Baptist where he
had sat with his head down, praying, as Ashbrook shot and killed
seven people and injured seven others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just praying to God to let this end,'' Neitz said.
</P>
<P>
   His youth minister, Adam Hammond, who was under a pew behind
Neitz covered in blood from one of the slain people, kept tugging
at Neitz's pants leg trying to get him to lie on the floor like
everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   But Neitz, one of several young people from Southwayside Baptist
Church attending the youth rally, stayed seated, face in his hands,
praying. For some inexplicable reason he jumped to his feet and
confronted Ashbrook when the man began cursing Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Beth Talley, 17, who was wounded as she risked her life by
holding down a distraught teen-ager who was trying to stand up
during the gunfire, said she heard Neitz confronting the shooter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard him say, `What you need is Jesus Christ,' and I
prayed, `Father please protect him,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hammond said he believes Neitz's actions in challenging Ashbrook
with a message of faith may have been the reason he quit shooting
so abruptly. He still had several clips of ammunition stuffed in
his pockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``God's fingerprints are all over what happened here,'' Hammond
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the shooting, Neitz has been interviewed on national
television and by publications such as ``People'' magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Neitz doesn't take any credit, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I think it was God,'' he said. ``God had control of
everything that was going on here that night.''
</P>
<P>
   Neitz doesn't have a good answer about why he stood up to face
Ashbrook.
</P>
<P>
   ``This might sound weird,'' he said, ``but I knew he would not
shoot me.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether he likes it or not, Neitz has become one of the young
people hailed because they were willing to stand up for their faith
in the face of death.
</P>
<P>
   Some evangelicals have emphasized the example of Cassie Bernall,
a 17-year-old Columbine High School school student who was killed
April 20 after the attackers reportedly asked whether she believed
in God and she answered, ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent reports in the Rocky Mountain News, The Denver Post and
an online magazine, Salon, quote another student, Val Schnurr, and
witnesses as saying it was actually Schnurr who made that
statement.
</P>
<P>
   But Bernall's mother, Misty Bernall, who has written a
fast-selling book, ``She Said Yes: The Unlikely Martyrdom of Cassie
Bernall,'' said in a statement issued by her publisher, Plough
Publishing House, that several witnesses verified her daughter's
affirmation of faith.
</P>
<P>
   In her book, Bernall says her daughter went through a troubling
period of adolescent rebellion. But, she said, when Cassie found a
deeper faith at a summer youth camp, it transformed her into a
happy, smiling teen with the courage to face life, and death.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Scott, the father of Rachel Scott, another Christian
teen killed at Columbine, spoke at Westminster Presbyterian Church
in Fort Worth this week in a program attended by many young people
from Wedgwood Baptist. He believes his daughter was killed because
she refused to deny her faith.
</P>
<P>
   Neitz says all people, young and old alike, have to stand for
something.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's good that Cassie Bernall stood up for her
faith,'' he said. ``I think everybody should stand up for their
faith and everybody should live for God.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he professed faith at Southwayside Baptist when he was
14, Neitz said, he strayed and did not return to the church until
about six months ago. At that time he contacted Hammond, the youth
minister, for help.
</P>
<P>
   Since returning to church, Neitz has gotten a job and is soon to
be married.
</P>
<P>
   Neitz does not want to be considered a hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you have God in your life, and know you are going to
heaven, I think you stand up for him no matter what.''

 &HT;    GOVERNORS, BUSINESS LEADERS, EDUCATORS SHAPE NEW PUSH FOR
EDUCATION REFORM
 &HT;    525&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALISADES, N.Y. _ Nearly half the nation's governors joined
leading employers and educators Friday in endorsing a new
three-point plan for the next stage of reforms in the nation's
schools.
</P>
<P>
   They concluded the third national education summit by calling on
all states to emphasize strategies for ``improving teacher quality,
providing all students a fair opportunity to meet higher standards,
and holding schools accountable for results.''
</P>
<P>
   The 114 leaders at the summit came from governments, companies
and organizations that supply more than 90 percent of the money,
teachers and administrators in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   None of their deliberations or conclusions required federal
action, noted Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson. He and IBM chairman
Louis V. Gerstner Jr. co-chaired the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to me is how we act on this,'' said John Pepper,
chairman of the executive committee of Proctor &AMP; Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   To put pressure on themselves, the governors agreed that they
will post reports on each state's steps toward meeting the three
goals six months from now on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   This summit was the first to include professional educators. It
built upon the standards-based school reform movement which grew
out of the previous two summits in 1989 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The 1989 summit, which consisted only of governors, said the
schools needed higher academic standards. The 1996 summit, which
consisted of governors and business leaders, said states should use
tests to see if students and schools were reaching those standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raising standards and developing tests may have been the
easiest part of the journey,'' said the ``action statement''
endorsed at the end of this year's two-day summit here. ``The more
daunting task is ensuring that all students reach these
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't sense any teacher-bashing here, and that was
gratifying,'' said Sandra Feldman, president of the American
Federation of Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Chase, president of the National Education Association, said
he found ``a surprising amount of common ground'' in his
conversation over dinner with Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, whose reforms
have contained some elements opposed by teachers in Chase's union.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got good words on paper, and now we have to make them
work,'' said Ohio Gov. Bob Taft.

low-achieving students without stoking the resentments of those

 &HT;    GOVERNORS, BUSINESS LEADERS, EDUCATORS SHAPE NEW PUSH FOR
EDUCATION REFORM
 &HT;    525&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALISADES, N.Y. _ Nearly half the nation's governors joined
leading employers and educators Friday in endorsing a new
three-point plan for the next stage of reforms in the nation's
schools.
</P>
<P>
   They concluded the third national education summit by calling on
all states to emphasize strategies for ``improving teacher quality,
providing all students a fair opportunity to meet higher standards,
and holding schools accountable for results.''
</P>
<P>
   The 114 leaders at the summit came from governments, companies
and organizations that supply more than 90 percent of the money,
teachers and administrators in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   None of their deliberations or conclusions required federal
action, noted Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson. He and IBM chairman
Louis V. Gerstner Jr. co-chaired the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to me is how we act on this,'' said John Pepper,
chairman of the executive committee of Proctor &AMP; Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   To put pressure on themselves, the governors agreed that they
will post reports on each state's steps toward meeting the three
goals six months from now on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   This summit was the first to include professional educators. It
built upon the standards-based school reform movement which grew
out of the previous two summits in 1989 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The 1989 summit, which consisted only of governors, said the
schools needed higher academic standards. The 1996 summit, which
consisted of governors and business leaders, said states should use
tests to see if students and schools were reaching those standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raising standards and developing tests may have been the
easiest part of the journey,'' said the ``action statement''
endorsed at the end of this year's two-day summit here. ``The more
daunting task is ensuring that all students reach these
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't sense any teacher-bashing here, and that was
gratifying,'' said Sandra Feldman, president of the American
Federation of Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Chase, president of the National Education Association, said
he found ``a surprising amount of common ground'' in his
conversation over dinner with Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, whose reforms
have contained some elements opposed by teachers in Chase's union.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got good words on paper, and now we have to make them
work,'' said Ohio Gov. Bob Taft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm particularly proud that this summit has focused on the
importance of excellent teaching,'' said North Carolina Gov. Jim
Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Their carefully worded manifesto, consisting of four pages
boiled down from a 67-page first draft, avoided taking sides in two

AFTER-HOURS ROLE IN THE SEXY CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Oct. 3) 
(jt) 
 By ANTHONY LAPPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a cluttered, unisex dressing room in the dingy
basement of the Greenwich House Theater last Wednesday night,
Cynthia Nixon was still aglow from her opening night performance as
a wry, listless WASP in Douglas Cater Beane's new play, ``The
Country Club.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nixon, 33, has become semi-famous playing Miranda, a
high-powered, wryly hard-bitten lawyer on HBO's ``Sex and the
City.'' But she still seems more at home in the low-rent world of
Off Off Broadway, where she got her start. ``Let's hope they feed
us,'' she said of the cast party.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the theater in a 1950s orange cocktail dress and a
diamond and emerald Tiffany necklace given to her by Beane, Ms.
Nixon was hit by a gusher of praise from stagehands and ticket
takers: ``Ms. Nixon, you were great!'' ``Nice dress, Ms. Nixon. You
are on fire.'' Her agent joined in: ``You were wonderful. Have we
discussed a musical?''
</P>
<P>
   The cast party was at Coup, a sleek new restaurant on Sixth
Street, near Avenue A. Missy Yaeger, who was in the play ``This Is
Our Youth,'' was there, and Josh Hamilton, who was in ``Cider House
Rules.'' Ms. Nixon posed for paparazzi with Amy Sedaris, a star of
the Comedy Central series ``Strangers With Candy.''
</P>
<P>
   This was Ms. Nixon's element. She grew up on the Upper West Side
and has been acting since she was 12 in television, on the stage
and in teen-age movies like ``Little Darlings.'' Seven years ago,
she helped found the Drama Department, the company that produced
``The Country Club.''
</P>
<P>
   As one of the four sexual adventurers on ``Sex and the City,''
Ms. Nixon is enjoying a newly raised profile. ``People in the
subway come up to me all the time now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the attention, she has little in common with the
bed-hopping characters on the show. ``It's not the New York I
know,'' she said, sipping a Gibson. ``I always had a sense of radar
for men that were trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   After missing several waiters with hors d'oeuvres, she finally
hailed a tray of bean quesadillas, while chatting with Will Arnett,
from ``The Mike O'Malley Show,'' a struggling NBC sitcom. He also
played one of Ms. Nixon's lovers recently in the HBO series. He
said, `` `Sex and the City' is the only show where the guys are the
meat.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nixon then had her fortune told by Karen Thorne, a
dark-haired astrologer and the mother of one of Ms. Nixon's
``Country Club'' co-stars, Callie Thorne. Ms. Thorne told Ms. Nixon
in a spacey tone, ``You have yet to reach your happy glow.'' She
held Ms. Nixon's hand. ``Your destiny is a fireball,'' she said.
``You can't lose it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still hungry, Ms. Nixon grabbed Patrick Breen, another recent
``Sex and the City'' guest star, and headed for Veselka, the
Ukrainian diner on Second Avenue. As Ms. Nixon devoured pirogis,
Beane arrived with hot-off-the-press reviews of the play under his
arm.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nixon was most pleased by a line that placed her in her
mid-20s. ``Hey, I'm still passing,'' she said. A few more minutes
of banter, and Ms. Nixon was off. She had another party to prepare
for in the morning. Her daughter, Samantha, is turning 3.

TV GOING TO THE DOGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICKI CROKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   National surveys show that we vacation with our dogs, sleep near
them, carry their pictures in our wallets, and overfeed them until
they are as fat as we are. So it shouldn't surprise anyone that we
are opening up our great household pastime _ television _ to them,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, sure, our little domesticated wolves have been denning
with us for a long time in the TV room, but now they're appearing
on the little screen in ever-increasing numbers.
</P>
<P>
   What's the big view of this little screen phenomenon? Does this
mean we yearn for the innocent years of Lassie and Rin Tin Tin? Are
we returning to family values?
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe. ``Judging Amy'' and ``Providence'' are about young,
high-powered women who give up the fast-paced life in LA and NYC to
return to their roots _ what else, hometowns in New England. And
dogs rightfully figure into the scenario. Amy's brother runs a
grooming business called Scrub 'n' Scram. And Syd's dad in
``Providence'' is a kindly veterinarian. When he lay down with dogs
recently, he woke up with insights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mad About You'' had Murray, and ``Dharma and Greg'' have
Nunzio and Stinky.
</P>
<P>
   If you want cozy hearth and home feel, make Fido part of the
formula, suggests Karen Rosa of the American Humane Association.
She works in the Western Regional Office in Los Angeles, the branch
that serves as the watchdog on the use of animals in the
entertainment industry. (That work started in 1939, when a horse
was run off a cliff during the making of the film ``Jesse James.'')
</P>
<P>
   Rosa says there's been a profusion of parts for dogs on TV, and
for animals in general. ``Our workload has tripled in just the last
few years,'' Rosa says. ``And TV work is growing by leaps and
bounds. We worked on 800 productions last year.''
</P>
<P>
   But the surge of dogs on TV defies one simple explanation, or
any one-dimensional role. The portrait of the dog has become much
more nuanced, textured, complex, even . . . in the TV world, that
really just means that as well as signifying wholesomeness, dogs
can also now figure into sophomoric jokes about sex.
</P>
<P>
   Take a recent scene from ``Stark, Raving Mad'' . . . please. The
main character, an anal-retentive book editor played by Neil
Patrick Harris, visits the apartment of a horror novelist suffering
from writer's block. And before Harris can say, ``Nevermore,'' the
novelist's dog Edgar is romancing his calf.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do I stop him?,'' Harris cries, as Edgar clasps his knee
and gyrates.
</P>
<P>
   ``With those legs, good luck,'' the writer responds.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more. ``The Norm Show'' hit early this season with
an episode entitled ``Norm Pimps Weiner Dog.'' Here, Norm put his
Dachshund out to stud, as they say in the fancy. And that led to
all kinds of ``bitch'' humor.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, there's a chance for growth. Dogs as characters have
room to stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as a society are becoming more and more aware of the bond
between animals and human beings,'' Rosa says. ``And animals and
children are incredibly compelling. So many filmmakers and
storytellers are including them simply as part of the reality of
life. . . . Plus they're funny. Animals can enrich the storytelling
process because they are a wonderful part of our lives.'' What more
proof do you need, Rosa asks, than the visceral reaction to just
the name Old Yeller?

LEAVING WELFARE SUITED FOR WORK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a big week for 64 women in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The women, all current or former welfare recipients, stepped
into a big, yellow semitruck and were fitted for a new
mix-and-match outfit courtesy of Mervyn's California.
</P>
<P>
   Mervyn's began what it dubs its Community Closet program a year
ago to supply women coming off welfare with suitable clothes for
job interviews and work.
</P>
<P>
   Mervyn's, part of the Dayton Hudson Corp., gives away 5 percent
of its profits to the community. When welfare reform came down, the
company thought about how it could help, said Jan O'Laughlin, who
manages the Community Closet program.
</P>
<P>
   The retailer identified three barriers to getting off welfare:
lack of reliable transportation, lack of low-cost child care and
poor self-esteem, which includes not owning suitable working
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Mervyn's decided to focus on women's clothes because 80 percent
of welfare recipients are women, O'Laughlin said. In the past year,
the retailer has outfitted 2,000 women across the county from its
big truck.
</P>
<P>
   The 53-foot rig parked in front of City Hall looked more like an
upscale store than an 18-wheeler. Inside, it is done entirely in
blond wood _ the floor, shelves, walls and doors. There was a rack
of clothes on one wall and dressing rooms at each end. But no cash
register.
</P>
<P>
   All the women got a choice of a blue or black three-piece suit
(skirt, pants, jacket) along with a silk blouse, sweater set,
shoes, belt, pearl necklace and stockings.
</P>
<P>
   A bevy of local store managers, along with a clothing stylist
from Los Angeles, helped the women make their color selections and
gave them tips on how to fix their hair and apply their makeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider it a blessing,'' said Batina Smith, who chose a
blue suit with a beige blouse. The 35-year-old mother of three has
been working at her retail sales job since March and got off public
assistance in April.
</P>
<P>
   For another excited woman, the new set of clothes meant she
could dress well like everyone else at her office. She just got off
welfare and couldn't afford to lay out the $350 it would have cost
to buy the clothes off the rack.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CLOTHES MEAN A LOT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The clothes mean so much for the women, who have traditionally
received their first working outfit from a thrift store, O'Laughlin
said.
</P>
<P>
   And that largess means a lot to Mervyn's customers. Mervyn's has
done surveys, and consumers decide where to shop based on how a
store contributes to its community, O'Laughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, when affordable child care was the hot-button
issue, Dayton Hudson spent $10 million on improving teacher
training and boosting pay and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   While the Mervyn's program is unique among retailers, other
companies also are reaching out to give welfare recipients a hand.
</P>
<P>
   Katy Mills mall is courting welfare workers to fill its 3,000 to
5,000 jobs when the mall opens Oct. 28.
</P>
<P>
   It's a great way to find workers in a tight labor market,
company officials said last month when they unveiled the plan. And
the shopping mall developer wanted to do something to help welfare
recipients find jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The mall is addressing the child care and transportation issues
head-on. The mall is building an on-site child care center and
shuttle buses will pick up employees and their children.
</P>
<P>
   So far, between 150 and 200 welfare recipients are in the
process of either getting hired or being trained at Houston
Community College, said Kevin Kudlo, vice president and development
director for the mall in Katy, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
COMMITMENT FROM EMPLOYERS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's easier for welfare recipients to find jobs when employers
seek them out, said Jeff Crain, area manager for Houston Works in
Houston. And with all the attention welfare reform has had, there
is more commitment among employers to hire welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Welfare used to be an entitlement program _ anyone who qualified
received benefits. That changed two years ago when Congress limited
the number of years a person could receive welfare. Limits are
based on previous job history and educational level.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, the maximum time anyone can receive benefits is 36
months, said Crain, whose organization put 1,777 welfare recipients
into jobs between May 1998 and July 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Several local organizations, including Houston Works, have
contracts with the Houston-Galveston Area Council to find jobs for
welfare recipients.

   PRIVATE-SCHOOLS (New York) _ Parents used to view private
schools as a gateway to good colleges and a rewarding career;
increasingly on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, having a
private-school child is a means of social advancement (italics)for
parents.(end italics) By Monique P. Yazigi.
</P>
<P>
   JIMENEZ-FASHION (New York) _ Part performance artist, part
designer, Ms. Elisa Jimenez, 34, likes to sew her clothes directly
onto the body and douse them in ginger, eucalyptus and other
spices. Hunger World, the name of her label and quasi-spiritual
fashion sect, embraces sexuality, ancient mythology and magic. Her
one-of-a-kind separates, with prices from about $150 for a G-string
to $800 for an evening dress, have become favorites among
celebrities known for their naughty she-power personas like
Courtney Love and Cher. By Julia Chaplin. Photo.

   GLAMOUR-NAILS (New York) _ With the advent of Korean-owned nail
salons here in the last decade or so, manicures and extensions,
called tips, have become affordable to all women, not just the
traditional privilege of the old money set (clear polish, short
tips) or the new money set (a flair for the extravagant, if not the
tasteful). By Alex Witchel. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   NITEOUT-CYNTHIA-NIXON (New York) _ In a cluttered, unisex
dressing room in the dingy basement of the Greenwich House Theater
last Wednesday night, Cynthia Nixon was still aglow from her
opening night performance as a wry, listless WASP in Douglas Cater
Beane's new play, ``The Country Club.'' Ms. Nixon, 33, has become
semi-famous playing Miranda, a high-powered, wryly hard-bitten
lawyer on HBO's ``Sex and the City.'' By Anthony Lappe. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-COLUMN (New York) _ The cultivar Actaea dates to the
1920s. It was a product of what aficionados call the golden age of
daffodils, when breeders stopped obsessing about tulips and started
exploring the possibilities of other bulbs. Of the 7,000 or so
daffodil varieties created during that golden age, Actaea is among
the few still available today. By Cass Peterson. Photo.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ I can't say I've ever paid much attention to my
fingernails. I don't bite them. I don't polish them. I don't even
cut them. If they get long enough, I peel them.
</P>
<P>
   I know, I know. But it's just one of those girl things that
never interested me _ like flower arranging. I stare at the
two-inch acrylic nails on the hands of cashiers at Zabar's and
Fairway _ the look that David Sedaris described as ``resembling
lacquered corn chips'' in a recent Allure essay _ and marvel that
they can even pick up a pen. And in my house, if I'm not the one
who takes on the glamour jobs of scrubbing the broiler pan or
picking pills out of their foil seals, they don't get done. Which
is fair enough. Hobble skirts and bound feet disappeared for a
reason. And I've certainly never yearned for hobble hands.
</P>
<P>
   I seem to be alone. With the advent of Korean-owned nail salons
in the last decade or so, manicures and extensions, called tips,
have become affordable to all women, not just the traditional
privilege of the old money set (clear polish, short tips) or the
new money set (a flair for the extravagant, if not the tasteful).
Sheril Bailey, the manicurist who is the author of ``The Sheril
Bailey Complete Manicure and Nail Care Handbook'' (Andrews McMeel),
said recently: ``It used to be that only wealthy women could afford
manicures, which they would have while getting their hair done.
Working women couldn't. When the small neighborhood salons started
in the '80s, suddenly a manicure became affordable for the working
class.''
</P>
<P>
   That working class included a new black clientele, Ms. Bailey
said, who embraced manicures ``as a way to say, `We know about
fashion.''' They took over, doing nails brighter and longer, she
continued, and the trend of nail art took off with hip-hop artists
like Mary J. Blige and Foxy Brown, who sported flamboyant acrylic
talons airbrushed with all manner of design, from stripes to palm
trees.
</P>
<P>
   The fashion world is now co-opting that flashy look: Gucci ads
this season show a hand with long black nails, the pinky pierced
with silver hoops; Marc Jacobs and Alexander McQueen both made
black, sparkly nail statements in their recent runway shows, and
the Gen Art fashion show featured 14-karat-gold nails. Some fashion
stylists are having their pinky nails airbrushed and calling it a
``Chloe nail,'' after airbrushed T-shirts Stella McCartney designed
for Chloe.
</P>
<P>
   One practitioner of the new nail art is Ji Baek (pronounced gee
beck), who owns Rescue Aromatherapy Nail Spa with her husband, Alex
Sobolevsky. Ms. Baek, 29, is a former viola prodigy who was forced
to abandon her studies at Juilliard when she developed tendinitis
in her shoulder. ``The first thing I did was get a manicure,'' she
said recently at her shop, at 21 Cleveland Place (Spring Street) in
lower Manhattan. Ms. Baek quickly recognized the need for ``a
middle ground'' between the neighborhood salons offering $5
manicures and the fancier places where they went for $80. ``People
my age don't want cheap stuff, but they don't have money,'' she
said. (A manicure at Rescue is $15).
</P>
<P>
   Besides shunning the use of thick acrylic tips in favor of the
thinner, more expensive silk extensions, Ms. Baek saw a need for a
tasteful, conservative translation of nail art from fashion and
hip-hop for women who ``want to be naughty but don't want to
experiment with their hair or get plastic surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nail design is recent for the upper middle class,'' she said.
``They want something, too, but they don't want to look like
that.'' She pointed to a magazine featuring blue fingernails
adorned with white feathers.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue's trademark is delicate hand-painted designs _ flowers,
animals, even tiny rhinestones set against a navy background,
though Ms. Baek acknowledges that most of her clients prefer to
keep those on their toenails. ``Your hands reflect your
personality, and nails make a statement about your individualism,''
she said. ``And yes, people get jaded. We're planning on doing
ladybugs for the fall and winter, when everyone is really bored.''
</P>
<P>
   Though I've never looked toward my hands as a potential source
of entertainment, I agreed to let Kathy Sanchez of Rescue give me a
full set of silk extensions, complete with a French manicure and
one tiny hand-painted flower on my left ring finger. The procedure
took 2 hours 15 minutes and cost $93.60, not including a $20 tip,
entirely fair for such painstaking work. Would I pay it again? No.
Not to mention that maintaining the job requires weekly follow-ups.
As for having to schlep back to lower Manhattan, the good news is
that Rescue will open a branch at Bergdorf Goodman in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   I must say I left Rescue floating, and couldn't wait to show off
my hands to everyone I knew. It was a job beautifully done, making
my fingers look longer and my rings look better. I even got some
admiring glances from women on the subway who had nail statements
of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The downside, I quickly discovered, was that I had no feeling in
the tips of the nails, an odd disconnect I couldn't quite get used
to. I was also not used to opening a box of Cascade with a knife
because I couldn't pull the spout with my fingernail, and once I
sat at my computer, I quickly realized that typing had become a
contact sport. I did love the sound, though. Whether my nails hit
Formica, wood or tile surfaces, it was my every tap-dancing fantasy
come true.
</P>
<P>
   My husband, who had shown no enthusiasm at all for this project,
was nonplused by the results. ``It's not he proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't like the flower?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   He squinted. ``Is that what that is?''
</P>
<P>
   I kept my promise to give him what I imagined would be a deluxe
back-scratch. But my nail tips felt strange on the skin, like
plastic, as if they were attached to a doll's hand. Back-Scratch
Barbie.
</P>
<P>
   No, no, no, I was missing the fun, I was counseled by Linda
Wells, editor in chief of Allure, who is an expert on all girl
things, including nails.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of nail art now is that it's done with a wink,'' she
said. ``Even if it's not American flags, women are definitely going
with wilder effects. Remember the Nicole Miller tie in the '80s? It
said, `I'm racy _ I'm wearing a kooky tie.' Nails are not next to
the face and don't affect the essence of how you look. If you
change your hair, you're stuck with it. You can be playful with
your nails, because it's temporary and then you move on.
</P>
<P>
   Nadia Yaron, a manicurist at the Antonio Prieto Salon, agreed.
``Nails have always been like a fashion accessory, and the kind you
have are a matter of taste,'' she said. ``But most women feel more
sophisticated with their nails. They feel sexy. It becomes an
obsession. Women come in even when they have no nails left, just
skin.''
</P>
<P>
   The only obsession I have at this point is the packing tape I've
been trying to strip off the new roll for a week now. It's too
humiliating to ask my husband or even the doorman for help. Though
I've come close.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you feel more feminine?'' Ms. Baek had asked as I left
her spa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do,'' I said wiggling my new tips. But a week later, the
jig's up. Yes, I enjoyed being a girl. It's just that I enjoy
opening a Diet Coke even more.

COMPUTER COLUMN: MAVIS BEACON _ STILL TYPING AFTER ALL THOSE
YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By LONNIE BROWN   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I don't know how old Mavis Beacon was when she first popped on
my computer monitor with her typing lessons some 12 years ago. So I
can't tell you now if she was 33 years old then and pushing 45 now,
or if she was 47 now and nearing 60.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the age, she doesn't look like she's nearing retirement
soon. The picture on the promotional materials for Mavis Beacon
Teaches Typing Version 10 is of a woman less than half retirement
age.
</P>
<P>
   Mavis doesn't exist. She's a Betty Crocker _ someone to give a
typing program a face and a personality. And like her counterpart
on the cake-mix boxes, she's done exactly what she was supposed to
do. Sales of the typing program have averaged 500,000 copies a
year; awards have been numerous.
</P>
<P>
   Her popularity is further proved on the shelves: Stores still
carry copies of previous versions _ priced lower than the estimated
street price of $50 for the new program _ because they still sell
well.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a reason to upgrade or buy the new version instead of
previous ones? Only if you can't do without some of the features
added to Version 10. One of the better ones: Users can now select
an age group and skill level when they go into the classroom to
sign up. Mavis will then select lessons appropriate for that group
while looking at the typist's strengths and weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   The program carries a guarantee to produce measurable typing
results for all students through 15 minutes of practice a day. It
offers frequent progress reports and sets benchmarks for speed and
accuracy for the student to beat in subsequent drills.
</P>
<P>
   The program is divided into three categories: classroom,
practice area and games. New this version is ``Far-Off Adventure,''
where students can practice typing rhythm. A smooth rhythm keeps a
hot-air balloon at the right speed and altitude. Other games
involve road races, undersea chase, space flights and grocery
checkout (for building skills on the computer keyboard's 10-key
pad).
</P>
<P>
   There's a new section of typing ergonomics that provides a check
list so students will know when they're typing correctly. To
further promote that, the program comes packaged with an ergonomic
mousepad (it has a rolled bottom edge to support the wrist) and a
stress ball to squeeze to exercise the fingers.

<P>
   LavaPort-Plus PCI is a plug-in card for computers with PCI
slots. The name of the card gives a hint of what it does: lava, the
melted rock flowing down from a volcano. The flow in the computer's
case is information sent to other devices.
</P>
<P>
   LavaPort provides two ultra high-speed serial ports capable of
handling data speeds of 460K bps and one enhanced parallel port to
which an external drive (like a ZIP) can be connected. The port
speed will be three times faster than the parallel port on the
computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``LavaPort-Plus (PCI) breaks the speed and interrupts
bottlenecks that limit expandability and performance in today's
personal computers,'' a company spokeswoman said. ``Combining both
serial and parallel port acceleration on one PCI bus card, the
LavaPort-Plus provides PC users with a single board _ and shared
IRQ _ solution for all of their I/O connectivity needs.''
</P>
<P>
   The new card builds on Lava's two popular products: a line of
COM port accelerators for modes and a parallel-port PCI accelerator
for Zip drives and parallel-port scanners. The new LavaPort-Plus
PCI provides both those capabilities in a single PCI-card.
</P>
<P>
   The company points out that users can now connect their external
modem to one of the card's serial ports, and use the additional
port to run their PalmPC or digital camera without using an
additional system interrupt.

 &HT;    KREMLIN URGED TO CONTAIN FIGHTING IN CHECHNYA
 &HT;    800&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Russian government Friday came under increasing
pressure at home and abroad to avoid a full-scale war in Chechnya,
even as warplanes pressed their assault on the breakaway republic
and ground forces made a limited incursion across the border.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after an unsettled truce ended a ferocious war
between Russian troops and separatist guerrillas in the southern
republic, Russia appears again on the brink of a large, if limited,
military entanglement in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The United States Friday urged Russia to use ``restraint and
wisdom'' in its drive against rebels in Chechnya. The State
Department has asked Russian officials to clarify their intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to believe that any resumption of general
hostilities in Chechnya would damage Russia's own interests and
would further threaten stability in the entire northern Caucasus
region,'' State Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Until reports Thursday and Friday that ground forces had moved
into Chechnya to occupy positions in the highlands just inside the
border, Russian's military operation had resembled NATO's strategy
during the war over Kosovo _ an air-only campaign that began 10
days ago.
</P>
<P>
   While Russia's air operations against Chechnya have won approval
from the majority of the public, a ground invasion conjures painful
memories of Russia's disastrous war in the republic from 1994 to
1996. Chechnya claimed independence when Russian troops withdrew,
but Moscow maintains that the republic remains part of the Russian
Federation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is a ground operation, a wide-ranging operation with
many federal army units, and resistance from fighters _ which there
will be _ we will have many casualties among our soldiers and
civilians,'' warned former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, now the
popular leader of a major political faction opposing President
Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this shouldn't be considered,'' he added in an
interview Friday night on Russian television.
</P>
<P>
   An editorial in the popular Russian daily Moskovsky Komsomolets
said Friday: ``With our poverty, we soon might face the same thing
we faced some time ago _ shame and new coffins. But the problem now
is there is no money even for the coffins.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has stressed the right of Russian
troops to move wherever they wish on Russian territory _ including
Chechnya _ but has also said Russia will avoid a repeat of its
brutal war with Chechen rebels. At least 30,000 people are believed
to have died in that war, which ended with a humiliating retreat by
Russian forces.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev suggested Friday that
Moscow was not planning a massive ground invasion of Chechnya but
would patrol a ``security zone'' inside the border. In recent days,
Russian officials have indicated that such a buffer zone could be
used to deter Chechen guerrillas from infiltrating to neighboring
Russian territory.
</P>
<P>
   Others have suggested that the Kremlin has not ruled out a
full-scale invasion of the territory 900 miles south of Moscow.
Russia has amassed about 50,000 troops, supported by tanks,
artillery and helicopters, along its border with Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``A security zone is being created sufficient to guarantee
security,'' Sergeyev said. Asked whether the zone would include the
Chechen capital Grozny, Sergeyev said, ``everything will depend on
further developments.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian planes have struck oil refineries, communications links,
airports and other targets inside Chechnya that Moscow insists are
used by Islamic militants to finance and support terror and
guerrilla warfare.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive was begun after a series of terror attacks on
apartment buildings in Moscow and other cities killed nearly 300
people. Russian officials have blamed Chechnya for supporting
terrorists and allowing Islamic guerrillas in August to invade
neighboring Dagestan, a southern republic under Russia's control.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Rubin called on Russia to open ``a political
dialogue with the more pragmatic leaders in the north Caucasus, not
antagonizing them or their populations.''
</P>
<P>
   He disputed as an ``almost ridiculous analogy'' comparisons to
the NATO campaign in Kosovo and the current Russian strategy in
Chechnya. Unlike Yugoslavia's President Slobodan Milosevic, who
controlled troops ravaging the Kosovo province, ``In the case of
Chechnya, there is no leader to coerce who has control over the
rebels,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, Putin announced that Russia no longer recognized
the government of moderate Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov and
effectively rejects the treaties signed in 1996 that ended the war.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing has forced as many as 88,000 refugees to flee
Chechnya for the neighboring Russian republic of Ingushetia to the
west, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. The
U.N. agency began deliveries of supplies to Ingushetia on Friday,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian government agency estimated this week that the refugee
total could climb as high as 200,000.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Reports say Russian ground forces, supported by tanks, have not
met resistance in their limited movement into Chechnya, occupying
six villages and establishing positions on strategic high ground as
far as six miles into the rebel republic.
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview Thursday night, from Grozny Chechen
Defense Minister Magomed Khambiev said more than 50,000 well-armed
and professionally trained fighters are ready to engage the Russian
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Russian ground forces need to complete their thrust into
Chechnya within the next six weeks if they want to set up a buffer
zone, according to a Russian military newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Fog and rain _ and snow in the higher elevations of the Northern
Caucasus mountains _ could hamper ground and air operations, the
newspaper said, quoting military sources.
</P>
<P>
   It also reported that Russian special forces are considering
commando raids specifically to target the two Chechen warlords _
Shamil Basayev and a Jordanian-born fighter known simply as Khattab
_ who led incursions into Dagestan in August and September.
</P>
<P>
   The elite units would go into Chechnya after the region's
infrastructure had been destroyed, Yuri Baluyevsky, first deputy
head of the Armed Forces' General Staff, was quoted as telling the
newspaper.

   CHRISTIAN-COALITION (Washington) _ In a striking testament to
the potency of his presidential quest, Gov. George W. Bush on
Friday glossed over many issues vital to the Christian Coalition
but still drew a rousing ovation at the group's annual conference
here. Unlike his rivals for the Republican nomination _ and past
front-runners who have addressed the organization of religious
conservatives _ Bush essentially delivered his standard stump
speech to the more than 3,000 delegates. His only nod to the group

have been slow. And there is at least the possibility that for
hoteliers, restaurateurs and impresarios, the party to end this or
any other century may turn out to be a bit of a bust. Not a total
bomb, of course. Reservations at hotels and restaurants are still
ahead of where they would be in a normal year, and travel and

JAPAN-TYPE ACCIDENT NOT LIKELY HERE, OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The nuclear accident similar to the one that
occurred in Japan on Thursday would not likely happen in the United
States because of special regulations and techniques used in this
country, federal officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory are
tracking the path of a radioactive plume from the accident in the
village of Tokaimura 70 miles northeast of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The last time that such an accident struck a uranium fuel plant
in the United States was July 24, 1964, in Wood River Junction,
R.I.
</P>
<P>
   In that accident, a nuclear worker received an extreme dose of
radiation _ about 40 times as much as a dose that would prove
lethal 50 percent of the time. He died 49 hours after the accident,
said Victor Dricks, spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, Dricks said the safeguards that are in place ``make it
extremely unlikely that we could have an inadvertent criticality
accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his comments implied the Japanese nuclear program's
procedures are less strict, Dricks replied, ``I can't answer that.
We're not commenting on the accident.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he didn't know if the Japanese accident would
trigger a federal review of safety procedures at U.S. nuclear fuel
manufacturing plants.
</P>
<P>
   Uranium nuclear fuel for commercial atomic reactors is
manufactured at seven plants in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, Japanese and U.S. procedures for manufacturing
uranium fuel for nuclear reactors appear similar.
</P>
<P>
   Both involve so-called wet processes, involving liquid solutions
of chemicals _ resembling a dark sludge _ such as uranium
hexafluoride.
</P>
<P>
   A common type of nuclear reactor known as a light water reactor
works by burning uranium nuclear fuel in the form of uranium
pellets stacked inside long, thin tubes made of zirconium.
</P>
<P>
   Bundles of these zirconium tubes sit in a pool of water. The
liquid slows high-speed subatomic particles called neutrons so that
they can engage in nuclear reactions with the uranium.
</P>
<P>
   While the nuclear reactor is on, neutrons split Uranium-235
atoms, causing them to unleash more neutrons plus energy. The newly
unleashed neutrons then split other U-235 atoms, causing them to
spill even more neutrons and more pure energy. This generates
enough heat to drive a turbine that, in turn, generates electricity
for a commercial power grid.
</P>
<P>
   Because uranium atoms naturally decay over time, releasing
neutrons, it is essential to avoid putting too much uranium in one
place at a time, otherwise the steady rain of neutrons could
trigger a chain reaction and a very small explosion.
</P>
<P>
   In a nuclear bomb, chemical explosives confine the chain
reaction into a small space long enough to unleash an extraordinary
amount of atomic energy.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, a normal criticality accident isn't nearly so
awful. If uranium-containing chemicals get too close together,
they'll generate just enough heat to blow themselves apart. That
separates them enough to shut off the nuclear reaction.
</P>
<P>
   During an accident like the one in Japan, victims see a blue
glow coming from the liquid solution in which they're mixing
uranium-containing chemicals. At that moment, a flood of neutrons
is ripping through their bodies, splitting DNA coils that control
heredity and upsetting the body's metabolism.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the victims feel nauseated and suffer diarrhea. In many
cases, excruciating suffering follows _ then death.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent such accidents in U.S. plants, officials maintain
tight limits on the amount of uranium hexafluoride that can be
placed into a tank at any one time, Dricks said.
</P>
<P>
   A different process, called a dry process, is used for handling
plutonium, at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, said lab spokesman
David Schwoegler. The lab has a plutonium research center used to
study the physics of plutonium deployed in nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Livermore's dry system _ involving poather than liquids _
is used because it is much easier to control than liquids,
Schwoegler said.
</P>
<P>
   In U.S. nuclear fuel manufacturing plants, some criticality
accidents have been caused by what experts call unfavorable
geometry _ that is, the chemicals getting into a shape that favors
a sudden critical reaction. The ideal shape for a disaster is a
sphere.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, in U.S. plants, workers pour uranium hexafluoride
into tanks that ``tend to be elongated, to minimize the likelihood
of a spherical arrangement'' of chemicals forming, Dricks said.
</P>
<P>
   Even a leading critic of the U.S. nuclear complex said processes
at manufacturing plants have improved since the early days of the
nuclear age.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the United States up through the mid-'60s, there were a
couple of dozen critical events throughout the weapons and civil
programs'' dealing with nuclear energy, but today ``it only happens
rarely,'' said Tom Cochran, a physicist who works for the Natural
Resources Defense Council in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the Japanese accident, Cochran said, ``It's going to
take months of investigation to determine why this happened.''

HOW TO CONTACT PAUL TIBBETTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ I am doing school research on the dropping of the
atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan. How can I contact crew members of
the Enola Gay? _ T.B., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ You can contact the pilot, retired Gen. Paul Tibbets,
in care of Mid Coast Marketing, 1620 E. Broad St., Columbus, OH
43203. He also has an official World Wide Web site at
www.theenolagay.com.
</P>
<P>
   Tibbets piloted the Boeing B-29 Superfortress Enola Gay, which
dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, causing an
estimated 66,000 to 240,000 deaths. He named the plane after his
mother, Enola Gay Tibbets.
</P>
<P>
   Autographed copies of Tibbets' book, ``Return of the Enola
Gay,'' are available from his Web site. Book signings are scheduled
for Oct. 1-4 at the Confederate Air Force Air Show in Midland,
Texas, and Dec. 4-5 at the Flying Tigers Warbird Restoration Museum
in Kissimmee, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ If you look at Texas license plates at an angle, you
can see circles with a series of numbers and letters. What is their
purpose? _ R.W., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ ``Those are lot numbers used for inventory and quality
control purposes,'' said Mike Viesca of the Texas Department of
Transportation. ``They are about the size of a quarter. Sometimes
they are in the middle, and sometimes on the side.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers and letters are on the 3M-manufactured sheeting
material that covers each license plate and makes it more
reflective, Viesca said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a safety feature,'' he said. ``It has a lifespan of about
eight years; that's why license plates are changed every eight
years.''
</P>
<P>
   During the past fiscal year, Texas prisoners manufactured 7.56
million license plates.
</P>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ Our church quit collecting canceled stamps. I don't
know what they were used for. Is there a charity that wants them? _
C.J., Arlington, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ Stamps for the Wounded, a not-for-profit group founded
in 1942, seeks donations of canceled stamps and other postal items
for redistribution to hospitalized veterans and outpatients.
</P>
<P>
   Donations should be in good condition, and if you are requesting
a receipt for tax purposes, include an inventory that estimates the
value of what you're sending.
</P>
<P>
   Send items to Stamps for the Wounded/LI, Box 1125, Falls Church,
VA 22041. To promote interest in stamp collecting and encourage
patients to be active, the group sends stamps and other supplies to
more than 11,000 veterans and stamp clubs at hospitals and
convalescent centers.  &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON, Sept. 31, -- Europe might be a long way from
Pennsylvania but this year there were 167,300 jobs in the Keystone
state supported by European businesses, according to a Fall 1999
study by the European-American Business Council.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Pennsylvania was fourth in the top ten states supported
by European-generated jobs, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania's scene is part of the European investment
nationally, which reached $470 billion and about 6.5 million jobs,
according to the study. California, New York and Washington are the
top three exporters to Europe. Those states also have the most jobs
supported by European businesses. The study said strong
transatlantic economic ties continue to boost the U.S. economy, the
study said.
</P>
<P>
   Pennyslvania's top export is industrial machinery, and computer
equipment, which adds up to $768 million. Electronic and electric

RUNNING AMOK WITH AOL? TRY THIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: I guess anyone who has been online for more
than a month or so has an America Online horror story. I won't bore
you much. They knocked me off for several weeks and continued to
charge me. Disgruntled users should do what I did. Fire AOL. Don't
even try to call their help desk. Call your bank. Dispute any
current charges, and don't accept any new ones. You'll get
attention real fast. _ Righteously Indignant
</P>
<P>
   Dear Righteously: Half of America must be ticked off at AOL,
judging by the ton of e-mail clogging up my mailbox after I told
some guy to just tough it out until he got through to a rep so he
could actually quit. I've got no beef with AOL, but I haven't tried
to unsubscribe lately, either. Plus, I'm so full of Saint Johnswort
right now, I'm starting to think this old world of ours is a pretty
wonderful place where all we have to do is love one another. Tell
you what: I'll let you guys do the ranting for a change.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: If you want to cancel AOL or another ISP, just
call your credit card company and tell them to refuse future
billing _ it's amazing how fast you will be canceled when you stop
paying. _ Chop 'Em Off
</P>
<P>
   Dear Chop: I wonder if that would work for my utility bills. I
don't think I really used all the electricity they said I did.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: Several years ago, I was having the same
problem with Compuserve. I hastened the solution by ``cutting them
off at the credit card.'' That got their attention. There were a
few threatening letters and e-mails, but they finally stopped. No
matter how tough and insensitive some of these leatherheads are,
they have a tender spot somewhere. Keep probing until you find it.
_ Free at Last
</P>
<P>
   Dear Free: Aren't any of you guys worried about this stuff
showing up on your permanent records? I almost got turned down by
the mortgage company because I had disputed a J.C. Penney bill for
some jockey shorts. Anyone who knows me knows it's boxers or
nothing. Lord knows what the AOL goons would have put in my
financial folder.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: I have found a phone number that AOL does not
give out freely that will help your reader cancel his service
without any problems: (888) 265-8008. _ Number's Up
</P>
<P>
   Dear Num: I actually tried this number on a Sunday afternoon and
got through to a real human being within 30 seconds. I was too
awe-struck to do anything but hang up, though. I should have at
least asked if his refrigerator was running. Better call it fast,
though, now that it's not a big secret anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: A suggestion: Write the attorney general of
Virginia. That is the state where AOL's headquarters is. The
address is: Office of the Attorney General, Anti-Trust and Consumer
Litigation Division, 900 E. Main, Richmond, VA 23219. _ Litigious
</P>
<P>
   Dear Litigious: Can't we all just be friends? I guess not. I
talked to a couple of suits at the AG's office last week while I
was making some other personal long-distance calls at work. Even
though AOL is in Virginia, they suggest writing your own state's
attorney general, then sending a copy of that to Virginia. Call 'em
at (804) 786-6551 if you have more questions. Use the phone at the
office.

PUTTING OLD HOME VIDEOS ON CD-ROM CAN BE DONE, BUT IT SURE WON'T BE
CHEAP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clil~us)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I just got a writeable CD-ROM drive. Now I'd like to take
some old home videos and put them on CD-ROM. What do I need to do
this?
</P>
<P>
   A: Unless your computer already has what's necessary, you're
going to have to make another hardware investment, and probably
pick up some new software as well.
</P>
<P>
   You will need a video card that can accept video images, or an
add-on video capture card. Most of these come with at least
rudimentary versions of video editing software. If you want to get
fancy, you'll probably have to buy the full version.
</P>
<P>
   Some computers come with a special port that is excellent for
capturing video, called FireWire or iLink. With this, you can
bypass the video card and take the images in directly, but your
camera must have one of these ports as well.
</P>
<P>
   Among the video cards that include video-in capabilities are
3dfx's new Voodoo3 3500 TV; ATI Technologies' All-in-Wonder 128;
and Matrox's G200 TV. All of these are available in both AGP and
PCI versions, except for the Voodoo3, which comes in AGP only.
</P>
<P>
   There are several products out there that will augment an
existing graphics card if you don't want to replace your current
model. For example, Iomega makes a device called the Buz that
connects to a PC or a Mac. (Note that Iomega recently said it would
quit distributing the PC version via retail, but you may still be
able to find some in stores.)
</P>
<P>
   You'll also need software if the package that comes with your
hardware isn't adequate. Try Ulead's Video Studio 3.0, MGI
Software's VideoWave II or, if you're really serious (and
affluent), Adobe Premiere 5.0.
</P>
<P>
   How much moolah are we talking about here? The video cards with
capture capabilities will run in the $200-$300 price range; add-on
boards will be a little less. The software will start in the $100
price range, and go up to well over $600.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a strange problem with Outlook Express 5. When I type
a line of text, it looks fine. It's in a normal font. When I type
the next line, it's much smaller. Then, when I type the third line,
it's back to normal. What can I do to stop this from happening?
</P>
<P>
   A: This is a known bug in Outlook Express, and it's easily
fixable.
</P>
<P>
   Click on the Tools menu, then click on Options. Go to the Read
tab, and then click on Fonts. Choose the Medium setting, and click
OK.
</P>
<P>
   You can find more information on this bug at the Microsoft
Knowledge Base at support.microsoft.com/support/c.asp. Enter
Outlook Express as the product you want to search on, and use the
keywords ``font changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Sometimes when I get an e-mail on America Online and it's
supposed to have an attachment, it comes through all garbled, with
a note that it's a MIME file. What is this, and how can I view the
attachment?
</P>
<P>
   A: This is a function of the way AOL's e-mail works. MIME, or
Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, is a way of converting a
file into a format _ a process called encoding _ that can be sent
via the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, AOL's e-mail software doesn't always handle the
decoding of these attachments properly. Instead of getting the file
as it is intended _ say, as a JPG picture, a word processing
document or a program _ it comes through with a .MIM extension.
</P>
<P>
   It is such an issue, in fact, that AOL has set up an area on its
Web site describing the problem and how to fix it. Use the keyword
MIME to read more about it.
</P>
<P>
   What you will have to do is grab a program that can translate
the .MIM attachment into the file it is supposed to be. A list of
programs is available at the MIME area on AOL.

`God's Little Acre' an earthy tale of the Deep South 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before TV sets were mass-marketed for American homes, reading
was a popular indoor pastime, certainly for adolescent boys. Books
were passed around, mostly paperbacks, and the most coveted items
were those with high quotients of sexual commotion.
</P>
<P>
   Was I a hypocrite? I professed not to like ``dirty'' books, and
some I did scorn, unread. But I certainly read Erskine Caldwell's
``God's Little Acre;'' and as soon as I finished it, I read it
again. Over a period of half a century plus, I've read ``God's
Little Acre'' I don't know how many times.
</P>
<P>
   If sexual curiosity was the initial lure, it soon ceased to be.
The lascivious goings-on in and around Ty Ty Hardin's rugged spread
in rural Georgia explain the novel's phenomenal sales _ more than
20 million copies in the Signet paperback edition alone _ but do
not define its greatness. ``God's Little Acre,'' Caldwell's fourth
novel, was published in 1933, one year after ``Tobacco Road'' made
him notorious. The two works have much in common: almost identical
Deep South rustic atmosphere, human characters reduced to
animality, and believably gamy dialogue sheathed in a rapid-fire
prose style.
</P>
<P>
   Only slightly tamer are some later, lesser-known Caldwell
studies of unlettered Georgia folk: ``Trouble in July, Journeyman,
A House in the Uplands, Tragic Ground, The Sure Hand of God.'' Each
may be worthy, but the author is vulnerable to a charge of writing
the same book many times.
</P>
<P>
   So why does ``God's Little Acre'' transcend the others? Not
because it's dirtier, if it is in fact so. Its strength is the
validity of characters with romantic and tragic substance quite
apart from their bawdiness. There's more sympathy here, or at least
there's greater compassion. ``God's Little Acre'' is a novel of
obsessions: Ty Ty Hardin is obsessed by the search for gold on his
rotted land. His son-in-law, Will Thompson, is obsessed by a need
to break into the closed-down mill and turn on the power. And
there's Pluto, the obese layabout, whose obsession is Darling Jill,
the youngest of Ty Ty's three voluptuous daughters. Where Jeeter
Lester of ``Tobacco Road'' is shiftless and apparently bereft of
ambition, Ty Ty is a committed dreamer, prodded by a primitive
religious faith. He is Dickens' Mr. Micawber transplanted in a
desolate, unforgiving earth.
</P>
<P>
   Bygone discovery of a few nuggets has fostered a local legend of
gold in this Georgia scrubland. Ty Ty is sure that his land will
yield gold, so he and his sons have pockmarked the spread with
holes from their incessant digging. Ty Ty continually redesignates
1 acre as belonging entirely to God. The widowed Ty Ty has little
to show for his life except three sons (one of whom has disowned
the family and gained wealth as a stockbroker in a nearby city) and
those three oversexed daughters (one of whom married Will Thompson
before the mill closed). Poverty is rampant, tragedy is inevitable,
yet the narrative is buoyed by a richness of folk humor.
</P>
<P>
   The story is funny and sad, not by turns but simultaneously.
``God's Little Acre'' and other Caldwell works were ineligible for
the Pulitzer Prize in fiction _ which, according to Joseph
Pulitzer's will, must impart a ``favorable impression of American
life.'' The lowest stratum of American life is Caldwell's own
preserve, and he was adamant that his novels did not exaggerate.
</P>
<P>
   Did people really live like this, and were they confined to a
specific region? Carolyn Chute's ``The Beans of Egypt, Maine''
would suggest that such primitivism prevails to this day, in the
Down East country as well. Two-thirds of a century have passed
since ``God's Little Acre'' apprised its first readers of our
nation's lower depths. It was a shocker then, but times and reading
have changed, and it doesn't shock now.

EXHIBIT FOCUSES ON THE PHOTOS OF GREAT ARTISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID BONETTI  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``From today, painting is dead,'' French
academic painter Paul Delaroche proclaimed when he was first shown
a photograph in 1839, the year the process was made public.
</P>
<P>
   And in England, when he first saw the products of the machine
that recorded realistic impressions of the world by means of light,
J.M.W. Turner, whose atmospheric, proto-Impressionist canvases owed
little to a ``photographic'' vision, exclaimed, ``This is the end
of Art. I am glad I have had my day.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the response to the camera eventually moderated.
Delaroche swiftly came around to seeing the virtue of using
photographs as a visual aid, urging fellow artists to compile
photographic archives of images they might find useful in their
work.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the attitudes of early modern artists toward photography
was often grudgingly negative. Yet even as many of them dismissed
the medium _ Edvard Munch said, ``The camera cannot compete with
painting so long as it cannot be used in heaven and hell'' _ they
used it, often in ways that considerably determined the form their
art would take.
</P>
<P>
   The fascinating exhibition, ``The Artist and the Camera: Degas
to Picasso,'' at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art through
Jan. 2, examines the complex relationships 14 turn-of-the-century
artists had with photography. Organized by the Dallas Museum of
Art, it is accompanied by a dense catalog (Yale University Press;
$49.95, hardbound) that abounds in fresh scholarship. Those who
think they already know modern art might find that this show will
overthrow some of their preconceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Among the surprises are some of the artists featured. We don't
expect to see Fernand Khnopff, Gustave Moreau, Alphonse Mucha or
Franz von Stuck at the museum. But modernism is far more complex
(and interesting) than the view that dates it only from 1900, as
the museum does. The museum might not collect art from before that
date, but it can certainly benefit from showing it from time to
time as its regular visitors can benefit from seeing it.
</P>
<P>
   Even though this is essentially a photography exhibition, an
important addition to the historical archaeology the medium has
undergone in recent years, the knock-out works are mostly paintings
and sculptures. Masterpieces by Edgar Degas (two pastels of ballet
dancers), Pierre Bonnard, Medardo Rosso, Constantin Brancusi and
Pablo Picasso (his ineffable rose period ``Boy With a Pipe'') are
of a quality not seen in local museum collections. And paintings by
some lesser lights, Khnopff, von Stuck and Felix Vallotton, for
instance, offer unexpected pleasures.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a thesis show, and it's not about ``great'' works,
even though it can boast of more than a few. And the idea addressed
_ how turn-of-the-century artists came to terms with the new medium
that utterly transformed image-making _ proves to be absorbing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The focus on photography's influence on painters and sculptors
who worked between 1885 and 1915 obscures the fact that the
exhibition is also a survey of Symbolism and its influences, the
primary interest, I suspect, of exhibition curator Dorothy
Kosinski.
</P>
<P>
   The thesis of the exhibition is made visually clear in the many
pairings of photographs with paintings, sculptures and works on
paper that relate to them, some of which are uncanny. The way
Munch, for instance, took two visually uninteresting studio
photographs of two female musicians and combined them to create a
lithograph, ``The Violin Concert,'' that is resonant with
unfulfilled longing goes to the heart of artistic creation _ the
ability to turn dross into gold.
</P>
<P>
   An even more dramatic example of artistic transformation is
evident in how Bonnard used a tiny 1 1/2-by-2 inch photograph he
made himself of a female nude reclining unalluringly on a bed in a
visually cluttered room to create one of his most erotic paintings,
``L'Indolente,'' an image of an open-legged nude sprawled upon a
large, sun-streaked, white-sheeted bed in solitary sensual abandon.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition makes it clear that there was no single pattern
followed by the artists investigated. Each of the 14 offers a
different model of how an inquiring artist can make use of a new
technological development.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the artists, like Degas, von Stuck, Khnopff and the
Nabis, Bonnard, Vallotton and Edouard Vuillard, took their own
photographs for their own purposes. Some, like Paul Gauguin and
Picasso, kept an archive of photographic reproductions of great art
masterpieces of different cultures for inspiration or to
appropriate when needed. Some, like Vallotton and Picasso, used
commercially available ``academies'' _ nude studies.
</P>
<P>
   Both Rosso and Brancusi took photographs of their sculptures
after they were completed, and Rodin, who never took a photograph
himself, commissioned photographers to document his work as it was
being made and after it was completed. In a unique instance, Degas
used Eadweard Muybridge's famous photographic time studies to make
physiologically accurate sculptures of galloping horses.
</P>
<P>
   None of these artists, however, took photographs that they
considered equal to their major work, however interesting we might
find them today.

 By CASS PETERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the fascinations of buying an old house with an
``established yard,'' as real estate ads call it, is discovering
the gardening tastes of its previous owners. Some former owner of
my old farmhouse planted a hedge of lilac, spirea and forsythia
closer to the house than I would have preferred, and I sometimes
wish for the cedar tree by the driveway to be magically transformed
into an oak.
</P>
<P>
   But the place is well supplied with old-fashioned perennials,
including a tall cultivar of heliopsis that I've yet to identify,
and irises and peonies of varieties that were popular in the 1930s
and '40s. And I was charmed the first spring to find a large clump
of Actaea daffodils growing at the edge of the kitchen garden in
the backyard.
</P>
<P>
   My daffodil expertise is limited, and it took me some time to
identify the variety. The daffodils bloomed so late in the season
that I could mix them in vases with lilacs, and were so fragrant
that the vases had to be placed near open windows to avoid
overpowering the room with the combined scent of lilac and
daffodil.
</P>
<P>
   The flowers are on the small side, with white, rounded petals
and a tiny yellow cup, gently fluted and rimmed with red. The stems
are slender and willowy, in contrast to the stout stalks that hold
up King Alfred's robust blossoms. In bloom, the clump looks like a
drift of large dogwood blossoms come to earth, or fairy faces
bobbing in a breeze.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, I understood the comments of the garden
writer Henry Mitchell that there is a difference between ``a superb
daffodil and a good old boy of a flower.''
</P>
<P>
   The name of the genus, Narcissus, is commonly thought to have
come from the Greek lad who was so taken with his own good looks
that he pined away over his reflection in a pool and was turned
into a narcissus flower. But it's more likely that it comes from
the Greek word ``narkao,'' which means ``to benumb'' and refers to
the narcotic properties of daffodil bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   The common name, daffodil, is a corruption of Asphodel, a lily
relative that hails from the same Mediterranean region as
daffodils.
</P>
<P>
   Daffodil bulbs, and to a much lesser extent their blooms, have
enough toxic alkaloids to be poisonous to people and animals. The
leaves and roots also contain needlelike crystals of calcium
oxalate, which make them indigestible and therefore unattractive to
deer and rodents.
</P>
<P>
   All this I learned in the process of identifying my pretty
clump, the inhabitants of which belong to the species N. poeticus,
or poet's narcissus. The cultivar Actaea dates to the 1920s. It was
a product of what aficionados call the golden age of daffodils,
when breeders stopped obsessing about tulips and started exploring
the possibilities of other bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 7,000 or so daffodil varieties created during that golden
age, Actaea is among the few still available today. Suppliers that
have it include White Flower Farm (P.O. Box 50, Litchfield, Conn.
06759-0050; 800-255-2852; www.800allbulb.com) and Old House Gardens
(536-W Third Street, Ann Arbor, Mich. 48103-4957; 734-995-1486;

</P>
<P>
   I have it, too, and I'd like to have still more of it. As with
many perennial bulbs, it is possible to increase your stock of
daffodils by dividing them, and it's a good idea to do that
regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Until I got acquainted with Actaea, I had assumed that daffodils
were perennial almost to the point of perpetual, and would thrive
with practically no attention from the gardener other than avoiding
cutting off the foliage until it had withered.
</P>
<P>
   If the bulbs have been naturalized with plenty of space between
them, they may not become crowded for more than a decade. But if
planted in clumps in flower beds, daffodils should be divided every
few years. My Actaea clump bloomed less freely than usual this
spring, a sign that it's overdue for dividing.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been best to do this in early summer, when the
foliage had withered but not disappeared. I always seem to miss
that ideal period, and I never have a bed prepared for the
daffodils in the summertime. My plan was to divide the Actaea in
the fall, as I did several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wouldn't be my first choice,'' Scott Kunst of Old House
Gardens said. The reason, he added, is that daffodil bulbs, unlike
many perennial bulbs, always have fibrous roots present, and those
roots begin growing actively again in the fall. If the tips are
damaged or dry out, root growth will be limited.
</P>
<P>
   N. poeticus cultivars, he said, are best moved in that brief
period after their foliage has withered, and then replanted
immediately. ``Poet's narcissus are notorious for never really
being dormant,'' Kunst said. ``But then I always say that gardeners
can do anything they want whenever they want, and the best time to
move the daffodils is when you think of it.''
</P>
<P>
   That perfectly matches my general philosophy about garden tasks.
And since the Actaea transplanted several autumns ago seem to be
doing well, I believe I'll risk it again. To minimize trauma to the
daffodil's roots, I'll do it on a cool and dampish day when the
soil is moist and pliant.
</P>
<P>
   If only it were as easy to move that shrubbery a few yards
farther away from the house.

   ``The Beautiful Game: Sixteen Girls and the Soccer Season That
Changed Everything''
</P>
<P>
   By Jonathan Littman
</P>
<P>
   Sports
</P>
<P>
   Avon, $23
</P>
<P>
   Reading Jonathan Littman's engaging account of one year in the
life of a teen-age girls' soccer team elicits more than a few
memories about proud-as-punch parents, painful losses and, more
times than your heart and patience can endure, wasted Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   Saturdays like the steamy spring one a few years ago on Fort
Worth's west side Lions complex. That's when a bubbly, bow-headed
young mother, bedecked in chic sweats and matching tennies,
suddenly appeared on the sideline at half time, cooler in hand. One
look, and you just knew her Suburban was idling in the parking lot,
ready to whisk her to brunch at the club after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls,'' gushed the mother as she passed out petite water
bottles to her daughter's teammates _ who were all more interested
in comparing fingernails and friendship bracelets _ ``this is not
just ordinary water.'' She paused, as if to let the drama build.
``Girls, this is ``sparkling water!'''' All the little bowheads
squealed.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, that's how many nonsoccer folk think of the sport
_ a game for the elite, for the white-dominated, monied suburban
crowd who have nothing better to do with their Saturdays but to
foist chilled juice and Rice Krispy treats upon their pampered
darlings.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately Littman's book, ``The Beautiful Game,'' is about the
grittier face of youth soccer. The girls of the Santa Rosa Thunder,
a Northern California team, come mostly from the more economically
challenged side of soccer tracks. These 13- and 14-year-olds aren't
chauffeured to practice in $40,000 SUVs, and don't gargle Perrier
at half time.
</P>
<P>
   Thunder is a new team, comprising remnants of a year-round Class
I team, the Eclipse, and a recreational-type Class III team, the
Fury, long mocked by Eclipse players. At best, the new Class I
Thunder, with its take-no-prisoners young coach, is an uneasy
alliance. But Thunder's goal is ambitious nonetheless: to win the
California State Cup championship.
</P>
<P>
   You most definitely don't have to be a soccer parent to
appreciate ``The Beautiful Game,'' but it helps, for Littman
records in abundant detail all the familiar nuances and scenarios:
</P>
<P>
   Parents wondering why some kid is getting so much more playing
time than theirs ... Wondering why, if the coach is so darn smart,
she can't communicate without screaming ... Enduring the
foul-mouthed, abusive coach on the opposite sideline ... Worrying
about who's jumping ship to another team ... Trying to remember
what life was like, especially weekends, before soccer. And,
``we're paying good money for this?''
</P>
<P>
   One might be tempted to dismiss ``The Beautiful Game'' _ the
title comes from soccer legend Pele's nickname for the sport _ as
just another juvenile sports book. You yawn and your eyes begin to
glaze. Well, this is no ``Bad News Bears Make the World Cup.'' This
is a sports story about a team with a heady goal, so to speak,
driven by Emiria Salzmann, a coach gifted in her game (college
All-America) but painfully flawed as a leader of young girls. As
the story unfolds, half the time you want to slap Salzmann's silly
teeth down her 22-year-old throat; yet other times, you wish your
child could play for her.
</P>
<P>
   The Thunder's tribulations are many. It is the 1997-98 soccer
year, and all the obstacles of rampant egos and insecurities,
jealousies and conflicts, race to the fore. Even El Nino proves an
indomitable foe. Because of record rains that winter, the Thunder
girls often have to practice on swampy fields or tennis courts.
They practice several days a week, for 21/2hours, in the rain,
cold, hail and lightning. One has to admire their determination, if
not their good sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Beautiful Game'' is sometimes uncomfortable reading,
because Littman, a former college soccer player, sugarcoats little
with his impressive behind-the-scenes reporting. But, then, that's
the same quality that makes the book compelling _ the intimate,
driving details of so many of the players, their coaches and
parents: Will bone-crunching Arlene, the team's enforcer, ever
learn to go easy on her teammates? Will the hugely talented
sweeper, Catherine, the team's quarterback, put school sports and
hanging out at the mall behind her and focus on Thunder? Will shy
Jenny, a reserve, and 95-pound Heather ever amount to a hill of
beans? How could the parent/assistant coach do what he did, and
will the young head coach who challenges coaching convention ever
prove herself right? Or grow up herself?
</P>
<P>
   So rich is the book's detail, especially about the 16 players,
that keeping characters straight in the early chapters can prove
challenging. But this is a minor hurdle. ``The Beautiful Game'' is
a story of a journey, an eventful and difficult journey for a team
and the players who comprise it, as well as for the girls' coaches
and parents. One father calls the excursion a love story; he may be
right. At the very least, it is the story of a talented, headstrong
and savvy group of girls who, in spite of circumstance and
themselves, forge a remarkable bond of mutual respect and uncommon
commitment, surprising themselves in the process.
</P>
<P>
   And that's precisely why ``The Beautiful Game'' is about so much
more than soccer.

 By JULIA CHAPLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The fashion designer Elisa Jimenez first trained her
eyes on me last spring at a trendy downtown clothing store where
she was giving one of her bizarrely ritualistic custom fittings.
</P>
<P>
   One of her customer-acolytes was sprawled on the shop floor on
top of a piece of shimmery tea-stained fabric redolent of exotic
oils, while Ms. Jimenez expertly snipped around her and fastened
the material with transparent monofilament fishing wire. She bit
the line in half, burnt a few holes in the hem for a lace effect
and turned and smiled at me.
</P>
<P>
   She then grabbed my shoulders and looked straight into my eyes.
``You're a beamer!'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A beamer?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You beam a very special energy. Would you like to model in one
of my shows?''
</P>
<P>
   I considered this an odd compliment. The only people who ever
tell me I should be a model are cab drivers and men lurking in
train stations. Perhaps Ms. Jimenez had spotted that hidden
something in me. ``Think about it,'' she whispered, slipping me her
number.
</P>
<P>
   I asked around and found out that I was just one of the hundreds
of women that the charismatic Ms. Jimenez had recruited at stores,
parties and on the streets of New York and Los Angeles over the
last few years for the Hunger World, the name of her label and
quasi-spiritual fashion sect that embraces sexuality, ancient
mythology and magic.
</P>
<P>
   Part performance artist, part designer, Ms. Jimenez, 34, likes
to sew her clothes directly onto the body and douse them in ginger,
eucalyptus and other spices. Her one-of-a-kind separates, with
prices from about $150 for a G-string to $800 for an evening dress,
have become favorites among celebrities known for their naughty
she-power personas like Courtney Love and Cher.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than show her clothes on a conventional runway, Ms.
Jimenez frequently stages orgiastic fashion happenings at old
churches, galleries and warehouses. She is one the few designers
represented by an art gallery; Holly Solomon Gallery added Ms.
Jimenez to their roster three years ago. They do not exhibit her
work on the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they arrange private fittings for clients and
occasionally house her 20-minute-long, mythically titled
spectacles. In ``Claiming the Sacred Harlot'' and ``In the Woods
... Well-Come-Bliss-Dawn,'' Ms. Jimenez is joined by dozens of
women wearing her sexy wood-nymph outfits undulating to a live
opera singer or drums. Somehow, the clothes always manage to slip
below the bust or waistline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elisa's clothes have a way of bringing out your more daring
side,'' said Miranda Brooks, an editor at Vogue, who recalled a
posh fashion event in which a long red dress Ms. Jimenez had made
for her drifted well below her spine.
</P>
<P>
   To perform in these spectacles, Ms. Jimenez maintains an
ever-fluctuating group of artists, musicians, stylists and
actresses, ranging in age from 16 to 40, who dance and model free
of charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I select my models out of intuition,'' Ms. Jimenez said. ``I
don't care if they're 5 feet 2 or 6 foot 3 and pregnant, but they
have to be open-minded, and they have to trust that the situations
I put them in will be safe.''
</P>
<P>
   In return for their modeling services, Ms. Jimenez, who has a
tattoo of a red flower between her breasts that appears to bloom
when she opens her arms, dotes over these women and hosts sewing
circles. At the marathon gatherings, which can last all night, the
Hunger World models sip honey wine, tell stories and learn how to
make their own clothes, so they don't have to ``spend all their
money at Prada and Gucci,'' Ms. Jimenez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elisa makes you feel like a princess,'' said Sarah Tregor, 22,
a graphic designer, at a recent performance that was being filmed
for the Hunger World Web site.
</P>
<P>
   No one had ever called me a ``beamer'' before, and so, after
resolving that I had lived in New York too long to be seduced into
a cult, I decided to take my chances and join the Hunger World just
in time for Fashion Week.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jimenez said she needed me in a show that was part of a
group exhibition called ``Fantastic Planet'' at an old shipping
warehouse in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The name of her performance
was ``Her Wild Horse Heart Matrix,'' and I had my choice of being
either a ``horse,'' which Ms. Jimenez said would require running
around with hooves on my hands, neighing and tossing my head
``rapaciously,'' or a ``heart,'' which would mean standing around
and ``exuding love.'' It wasn't a hard decision to make. I would be
a heart.
</P>
<P>
   I arrived for the 1 p.m. call time. (Our show was scheduled for
7:30 that night.) There were 20 or so other models, many of whom
were regulars and some ``newbies'' like me, sitting in a lot out
back, combing each other's hair and giggling.
</P>
<P>
   Among heaps of clothes, I noticed a jar of McCormick cinnamon,
which Ms. Jimenez explained would be sprinkled on the horse dresses
in the shape of a love sign to evoke prosperity and sexuality.
There were oils, a guitar and a copy of Jack Kerouac's ``On The
Road'' that belonged to one of the models. Over in the distance, a
young woman with a Walkman on was sleeping on a huge rock.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ms. Jimenez looked like a female warrior, racing
around in tight brown tea-stained pants with sewing needles stuck
handily in the fabric. When it was time for my fitting, she led me
into a moldy bathroom with a clogged toilet.
</P>
<P>
   My heart dress was purple and white and extremely slinky,
low-cut down the back and high cut up the back of my legs. It
smelled ripe. ``I marinated the fabric in red wine, whiskey and
sugar,'' Ms. Jimenez said. ``So you'll be intoxicating.''
</P>
<P>
   For my hair, a volunteer in a blue camouflage T-shirt emptied
half a can of Edge shaving gel onto my scalp. ``It keeps the hair
looking wet,'' he told me. Ever heard of Paul Mitchell? I wondered.
I also wondered if anyone here even knew what the Hunger World was.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all pretty vague,'' said the only male model, a thin
18-year-old ballet dancer named Misha Braun who had on brown
motorcycle boots underneath his horse outfit. ``But I feel like I'm
on the cutting edge of fashion. That band Hole wears her stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   I headed over to the other side of the parking lot. There, a
robust blonde named Silvie Jensen, 22, the in-house opera singer
for the Hunger World, was making patterns in the dirt. ``Elisa
wants me to sing the words `Do you know what you see when you see
what you know.''' Ms. Jensen confided. ``But I'm not going to do
it. It's too banal. I'm just going to sing vowel sounds like in
Mozart!''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jensen would be modeling two clumps of clay that she would
smear over each breast. Ms. Jimenez planned to sell the clay tops
as part of her Spring 2000 collection.
</P>
<P>
   By 6 p.m., we had the runway set up. Ms. Jimenez's laid down
white masking tape on the pavement in a giant spiral. (It's
supposed to symbolize a labyrinth.) Around the outside, we placed
several large pieces of brown paper and fabric held down by rocks
to serve as seating for the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jimenez instructed me to drip ylang-ylang oil over
everything to induce feelings of love and openness. I decided to
smear a bunch on myself to enhance my mood.
</P>
<P>
   Show time. We all huddled in a little room, and Ms. Jimenez gave
us a pep talk. ``Don't be intimidated by the crowd, be confident,''
she said. ``You're all beautiful!'' No one seemed to know what was
going on. I looked around at our small group.
</P>
<P>
   One woman was almost twice as tall as everyone else, another was
pregnant, some had rolls of fat hanging out and some had armpit
hair. The thinnest ones were wearing loin cloths and tall black
boots.
</P>
<P>
   When it was my turn to go out, I waved my arms in the air like a
beating heart. Ms. Jensen was singing, ``Do you know what you see
when you see what you know.'' I could see my boyfriend through the
whirl of horse girls cantering around me, his mouth hanging open in
shock.
</P>
<P>
   I started to recognize people in the crowd. I closed my eyes and
tried to exude love. By the time I looked again, almost everyone
had gyrated off stage. Ms. Jimenez was standing on the side
``beaming'' like a proud parent.
</P>
<P>
   The Hunger World seemed like a nice place to visit, but I felt
it was time to go home. As I was leaving, Ms. Jimenez invited me to
an ``evening of reciprocity,'' as the post-show sewing circles are
called. It was held at one of the model's apartments at Union
Square. About 12 of the women showed up, and each had brought some
fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzy Star, a folk rock group, played softly in the background,
and honey wine was served in paper Dixie cups. We talked about the
availability of Nike Air Rifts, the sneakers that separate the big
toe from the rest of the foot, and the film ``American Beauty,''
while Ms. Jimenez helped each woman make an article of clothing.
</P>
<P>
   She showed me how to sew a black halter dress. She cut a
pattern, and I stitched it up with transparent fishing wire. Five
minutes later, I pulled it over my head. All the women crowded
around my flirty cocktail number in awe. ``It's beautiful!'' they
cooed. I looked in the mirror. It was true. The same dress would
cost at least $700 at Barneys.

TWO NEW EXAMPLES OF MOUSE EVOLUTION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The computer mouse has come a long way, baby, since Douglas
Englebart's very first model, invented in 1963 as a simple wooden
shell on wheels. When it was finally patented in 1970, it was given
the catchy name of ``X-Y Position Indicator for a Display System.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, mice are the primary way folks interact with their PCs,
thanks to graphical interfaces and Web browsers. They're bristling
with new features, and you certainly won't suffer any wood
splinters from the smooth plastics and ergonomic shapes currently
used.
</P>
<P>
   And the mouse continues to evolve. A stroll down the
pointing-devices aisle at your local computer store will turn up
dozens of different styles and designs.
</P>
<P>
   I've been playing with two of the more advanced models from the
biggest players in the mouse category _ Microsoft and Logitech.
Both are excellent mice, but I sure wish either company would
combine the best attributes of both into one. It'd be a killer.
</P>
<P>
   _ IntelliPoint Explorer, $75, Microsoft: Anyone who has used a
computer for any length of time knows what eventually happens to
its mouse. No matter how clean you keep your workspace, dust, hair
and bits of grit are picked up by the mouse's ball and deposited
inside its housing.
</P>
<P>
   This junk gets onto the rollers that sense which way the ball is
moving _ and those rollers ultimately transmit location information
to the PC, which controls your cursor. If the rollers can't roll
smoothly, you get sluggish performance, or your mouse appears to
hit ``dead spots'' where the cursor won't even move.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's slick new IntelliPoint Explorer mouse fixes this
problem by doing away with the ball and replacing it with a bright
light and a tiny camera. The light points at the work surface, and
the camera snaps 1,500 ``pictures'' a second, reporting the changes
as movement back to the PC. That's a much faster report rate than
you get with a traditional mouse, resulting in smoother onscreen
movement. It also plugs into either a PS/2 or a Universal Serial
Bus port _ use the latter, if you can, for the best responsiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Because there's no ball, you don't need a mouse pad. You can use
this mouse on almost any surface, from the top of a desk to the top
of your thigh.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, this is not the first use of optical technology in
mice. Sun Microsystems for years made an optical mouse, but it
required a mirror-like mouse pad.
</P>
<P>
   The IntelliPoint Explorer, despite its klunky name, has a cool
design. It's a silvery gray on top and a translucent red on the
bottom. A bit of this translucent plastic curves up at the back of
the mouse, showing a red glow when the computer's on.
</P>
<P>
   It has two buttons in the usual place and a scrolling wheel
centered between them that, when pushed, serves as a third button.
There are two more buttons on the left side, where your thumb would
be, which are preset as forward and back browser-page controls. You
can, of course, reprogram all five buttons.
</P>
<P>
   I enjoyed using this mouse, particularly when playing
fast-action games, because it moved so smoothly, both on the
desktop _ where I'd removed my mouse pad _ and onscreen. My only
complaint about the design is that the thumb buttons are placed too
high on the side _ they should be lower, where the thumb naturally
falls when holding the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   This model is a bit pricey, but Microsoft also has a $55 version
that puts the light-and-camera feature _ which it calls IntelliEye
_ into its standard mouse body. Now, if only it was cordless ...
</P>
<P>
   _ Cordless MouseMan Wheel, $60, Logitech: Once you've used a
cordless mouse, it's hard to go back, and Logitech has long made
the best cordless mice around. Even after playing with Microsoft's
impressive new product, I'm probably going to return to this one.
</P>
<P>
   The Cordless MouseMan Wheel has the same rounded, satisfying
feel as the curvy Logitech MouseMan Wheel. Like the Microsoft
mouse, it's a silvery gray. It's got some heft to it, and will easy
fill a large hand. People with small hands might not find it as
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   It's got rubberized sides for a solid grip, and a thumb button
properly placed near the bottom of the mouse's left side. The wheel
centered between the right and left mouse buttons also can be
programmed as a button. It doesn't quite roll as smoothly as the
Microsoft wheel, however.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this mouse is best known for what it lacks _ a cord.
It uses radio waves to send its position signals to a small base
station _ about the size of a cigarette pack _ that plugs into a
computer's PS/2 port.
</P>
<P>
   The mouse uses a pair of triple-A batteries, which last about 4
to 6 months before they need to be replaced. You can tell when the
batteries are low _ the mouse occasionally loses contact with the
base station, which is easily fixed by pressing a button labeled
Connect on the base.
</P>
<P>
   Not having to keep a cord out of the way is a joy, particularly
in fast-action gaming. But, because of the limitations of the radio
frequencies used, the reporting rate to the computer is slower.
It's not something you notice in day-to-day Windows usage, but it
becomes quickly apparent in a hectic Quake III Arena firefight.
</P>
<P>
   Both mice come with useful software for configuring the various
buttons and other features. I prefer the Logitech MouseWare
program, which is easier to use and has more options.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, this mouse doesn't use the USB port, but again,
the speed-up you'd get with that option is likely to be negated by
the radio connection. It would be nice to see some technology that
inexpensively speeds this up. Then, if Logitech just converted to
an optical system to replace the ball in its cordless mouse, I'd be
in pointing-device heaven.
</P>

(th) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reggie Conyngham-Jervis is not an effusive mourner. In the
person of Albert Finney, seated in a London hospital waiting room,
he turns to a man who has just told him that his wife, like
Reggie's, died the night before and says, barely looking up from
his newspaper, ``Well, look at the bright side, what?''
</P>
<P>
   That man also turns up at Reggie's wife's funeral and murmurs
sympathetically, ``One day at a time, eh?'' To which Reggie replies
brusquely, ``Whatever you say, old chap.'' This is one repressed
Englishman.
</P>
<P>
   So it's all the more devastating to see Reggie arrive home that
night and, without thinking, stop at the staircase and call,
``Mary!'' In that second, as he realizes with blow-to-the-gut force
what has happened, signs are good that in ``A Rather English
Marriage,'' the ``Mobil Masterpiece Theater'' series has come up
with a remarkable drama.
</P>
<P>
   The other fellow, Roy Southgate, is played by Tom Courtenay,
Finney's co-star in both the stage and film versions of ``The
Dresser.'' Again, Finney ends up giving orders; again, Courtenay
serves; again the two men come to recognize a meaningful bond;
again both actors are outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Sad to say, ``A Rather English Marriage'' turns into sentimental
odd-coupleness at times. But the film is compelling from the
beginning, and in the course of two hours there are enough flashes
of brilliance to make it very worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie is a gruff old guy who, more than 50 years after the war,
still encourages people (nurses, prostitutes, his pals at the pub)
to call him Squadron Leader. Roy is a gentle soul, a retired
milkman who tells the social services worker who visits him that
he'll be fine cooking and cleaning for himself, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie, visited by the same worker, flirts with her and asks her
to dinner. She suggests that Roy move into Reggie's house (Reggie's
wife had money, most of which she has left to her nieces) to help
with household chores and for companionship. He does, but he's soon
addressed as Southgate and treated like a servant.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are dealing with their grief mostly silently (through
beautifully photographed flashbacks of their younger selves with
their young wives). Roy has the added weight of visits to his son,
Alan (Sean Murray), in prison. Then a romance complicates things.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie meets Liz Franks (Joanna Lumley, as convincing in drama
as she is in comedy as the happily hedonistic Patsy Stone of
``Absolutely Fabulous''), an attractive, middle-aged dress shop
owner, at the pub and they go out a few times. That she seems most
interested in him when she has financial problems is not a good
sign. Through it all, 1940s big-band numbers like ``Pennsylvania
6-5000'' and ``Moonlight Serenade'' play, setting a mood of fond
nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Rather English Marriage'' was written by Andrew Davies, who
has done television adaptations of ``Moll Flanders,'' ``Pride and
Prejudice'' and, a while back, ``To Serve Them All My Days.''
</P>
<P>
   The director, Paul Seed, has worked with Davies before, as
director of the BBC mini-series ``House of Cards'' and ``To Play
the King.'' Even when ``A Rather English Marriage'' gushes a
little, it's good to be in the hands of masters.

for Sunday, Oct. 3, will move Saturday.

<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   FERTILITY-BIOTECH-REVIEW (Undated) _ There is perhaps no more
unsettling noise in medicine than the sound of infertility
specialists tinkering with the biological clock. Witness the uproar
over their latest technological triumph, the apparent reversal of
menopause in a 30-year-old ballerina whose ovaries had developed
cysts. But the most remarkable thing about the supposed end of the
biological clock may be just how unrevolutionary the reproductive
revolution has been. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg. (`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   SAFRICA-RACE-REVIEW (Johannesburg) _ Five years after the death
of apartheid, some South Africans are still struggling to redefine
themselves and their roles here. And some are finding that old
classifications fade slowly from the hearts and minds, the politics
and economics of the new South Africa. By Rachel L. Swarns. (`i'
category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   VISITATION-RIGHTS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The idea that grandparents
have a right to see their grandchildren has much sentimental
appeal. But the legal issue of what third parties should have
visitation rights, even against a parent's will, is complex. In
Washington state, visitation rights were awarded under a law giving
such privileges not just to grandparents, but also to unspecified
third parties, if continued contact is in the child's best
interest. The U.S. Supreme Court will consider the
constitutionality of that law, in a case closely watched by
family-law experts By Tamar Lewin.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-FATHER&AMP;SON-REVIEW (Washington) _ As George W. Bush stakes
his own claim to the White House, he and his father still seem to
be resolving _ or, just as often, failing to resolve _ how to play
this whole filial-parental thing. And they continue to discover
that the elder Bush's history and the younger Bush's destiny
intersect in odd and unexpected ways. By Frank Bruni.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS-CHOKING-REVIEW (Undated) _ The psychology, and history,
of choking. Clutch and choke, as sporting terms, came from auto
racing and spread to other sports. Hemingway, writing about Joe
DiMaggio, defined `clutch` performance for all time: `Grace under
pressure.' `Choke` has never needed a Hemingway to define it. By
Allen Barra.
</P>
<P>
   GOP-BUDGET-REVIEW (Washington) _ The GOP, custodians of fiscal
responsibility, in the hot seat. It has been the deliberate
strategy of House Republicans to promise the American people that
they would not finance the operations of the government by spending
money out of the Social Security trust fund. To try to keep this
promise, the Republicans thus far have used every accounting device
in the book, and some previously unrecorded, to try to make the
numbers add up the way they want. By Tim Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   MONEY-LAUNDER-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at why it's so hard to
nail the bad guys in money-laundering cases. Much of the money
flowing around the world these days flits across borders
electronically in the blink of an eye. And that can be much harder
for banks to monitor than paper checks. By Timothy L. O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   REAGAN-BIO-REVIEW (Undated) _ Critics have chided Edmund Morris
for writing Forrest Gump-or-Zelig-meets-the-Gipper instead of a
conventional biography of Ronald Reagan. But such comparisons are
inexact. Forrest Gump and Zelig were comic creations, while Morris
is a serious biographer with a serious mission. He is trying to
make myths in the only way they can be made in these ironic times:
by pretending someone else is narrating.
</P>
<P>
   TWAIN-HANGING-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Back when hangings were a
gruesome public spectacle, people turned out to see the show _ Mark
Twain included. His eyewitness account of a celebrated 1868 hanging
in Virginia City, Nev., was recently rediscovered. Some excerpts.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week, leading
with Warren Beatty as a possible presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-U.S.-REVIEW (Washington) _ Half a century of fearing
China: if you ask the `Old China Hands' _ men like like John Paton
Davies and his younger counterparts who traveled the countryside as
Mao battled the Nationalists _ the problem of striking a balanced
view of China in Washington has never been easy. In fact, the
popular imagery has almost always been out of sync with the
reality. By Alan Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   KOREA-MASSACRE-REVIEW (Paris) _ The report that U.S. soldiers
massacred civilians in the Korean War raises a larger question: at
the end of the 20th century, the century of total war, can the
protection of civilians ever be more than a thin pretension, even
when protecting civilians is the declared war aim? Recent
experience in the Balkans is not encouraging. By Craig Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-RIGHTS-REVIEW (London) _ Britain prepares for a
constitutional revolution that will profoundly alter its citizens'
relationship to the state and the rule of law. A year from now,
when Britain incorporates the European Convention on Human Rights
into domestic law, ordinary Britons will for the first time have a
set of fundamental human rights that can be enforced in British
courts, similar to those guaranteed by the Bill of Rights in the
U.S. By Sarah Lyall.

BLUEPRINTS IN GENES: ARCHITECT'S BODY OF WORK MAY BE MORE THAN JUST
METAPHOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SARAH BOXER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was only a matter of time. And space. Sooner or later,
someone was bound to suggest that architecture is a biological
function. Since classical times, buildings have been likened to
bodies. Now the metaphor has grown up: buildings are not just like
bodies; they are deeply biological.
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars are now saying the kinds of buildings that people
design and the choices they make about where to put them are, to
some degree, inherited. Architecture is part of what Richard
Dawkins has called ``the extended phenotype,'' genes' ``effects on
the world at large.''
</P>
<P>
   Biology and architecture have been through a lot together. The
Roman architect Vitruvius codified the idea that the proportions of
buildings should be based on the ideal human form. In the
Renaissance, the metaphor was revived. Descartes compared muscles
to pneumatic devices. And Claude Perrault, designer of the east
front of the Louvre, explained the action of an arm _ its extension
and flexion _ by the mechanical analogy of a mast held by two
ropes.
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th century, biological metaphors for building started
to get out of hand. Dr. Adrian Forty, a historian of architecture
at University College, London, wrote in ``The Architecture of
Science'' (MIT Press, 1999) that Viollet-le-Duc first used the word
``circulation'' to describe humans moving around a building in
1872, some 250 years after Sir William Harvey used ``circulation''
to describe blood moving around a body. It was not the best of
metaphors. As Forty points out, people do not generally move round
and round in a building, hitting every room. But the metaphor was
still wildly successful, reaching its peak in Le Corbusier's
proposition ``Architecture is circulation.''
</P>
<P>
   Why so popular? Forty believes it's because it made architecture
seem scientific. ``Each one of the countless scientific metaphors
in 20th-century architecture is a little experiment, an attempt to
find a relationship between architecture and one or another branch
of science,'' he writes, ``but they all rely on our belief that
really, at the bottom, architectural practice is not scientific,''
that ``architecture cannot reach where science may.''
</P>
<P>
   The 20th century pushed the parallels between building and
biology to the breaking point. In 1928 Hannes Meyer, the second
director of the Bauhaus, declared, ``Building is a biological
event.'' What he meant was that buildings are not designed so much
as determined by their function and the constraints of construction
and materials. Buildings are not works of art. They are
technological organisms.
</P>
<P>
   Dreary as Meyer's formulation was, it did parallel some of the
lessons of D'Arcy Thompson's 1917 book ``On Growth and Form.'' If
Thompson showed how ``the forms of living things'' and their parts
_ skeletons, eggs, eyes, webs, shells _ ``can be explained by
physical considerations,'' Meyer did his best to enforce nature's
sternest laws.
</P>
<P>
   Now the building metaphors have gone genetic. In ``The
Monumental Impulse: Architecture's Biological Roots'' (MIT Press,
1999) Dr. George Hersey, an emeritus professor of art history at
Yale University, enumerates the similarities between nautilus
shells and spiral staircases, termite mounds and obelisks,
honeycombs and dome interiors, and concludes that the desire to
build is ``in our genes.'' Human beings appear to have inherited
some sort of architectural impulse.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are genetic homologies between us and the other species
that build, no matter how distant from us they seem,'' Hersey
writes. ``Science writers are always calling the genome a
blueprint; now I will call a blueprint a genome.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally there are problems with this idea. One of the biggest
stumbling blocks is that even though bees and termites are
wonderful architects, ``our own closest cousins, the other
primates, hardly build at all,'' Hersey writes. ``An African
termitary might remind us of Wright, or a Gaudi spire, or of a
skyscraper by Hermann Obrist. But no such thought comes to mind
when we look at the rudimentary retreats of chimps and gorillas.''
</P>
<P>
   Apes are terrible architects. ``Thus any genetic homology that
brackets us with the other builder-species will have to be very
ancient and, also, will have to have bypassed our immediate
ancestors and cousins,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds pretty unlikely, doesn't it? But Dr. E.O. Wilson, a
biologist at Harvard University, says there may be a kernel of
truth in it. Although the kinds of rules that determine the way
that nautiluses grow shells and the way termites build their
platforms and arches are far, far simpler than the kinds of rules
that determine the way human architects build, it is possible that
humans have inherited a monumental impulse, perhaps even an impulse
to build certain kinds of structures.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson says that when it comes to certain esthetic judgments _
the way human beings see and talk about color, decide how much
complexity they like in a painting or think about where they would
want to live _ there are ``genetically determined regularities,''
inherited tendencies they share with the rest of the species.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although Wilson was not ready to say anything about what kinds
of buildings human beings are wired to build and to like, he gladly
offered a description of the kind of real estate they are wired to
prefer. In much the same way that the Russian artists Vitaly Komar
and Alexander Melamid surveyed people around the world to find out
what they like in a painting (they love lots of blue), so Dr.
Gordon Orians, a zoologist at the University of Washington, has
surveyed people about their taste in landscape. (What they like are
places that alleviate their most primitive anxieties about
survival.)
</P>
<P>
   In a recent lecture to the American Society of Landscape
Architects at Harvard's Graduate School of Design, Wilson expanded
on Orians' findings about human landscape preferences. Given
complete freedom, Wilson says, people will gravitate to
environments with the following features: ``They want to live, to
have their habitation on a height, looking down. They prefer open
savannalike terrain, parkland with scattered trees and copses. And
they want to be near a body of water, such as a river or lake,''
even if the water has no function.
</P>
<P>
   They also want a retreat with good prospects for foraging. They
want to see ``trees that have low, nearly horizontal branches,
preferably with compound, finely divided leaves,'' he said. And
they want to see large animals, like deer and sheep, scattered off
in the distance. That may be why people decorate their lawns with
animal statuary, Wilson observed in a telephone interview. (Lawn
jockeys are still a mystery.)
</P>
<P>
   Wilson even speculated about why humans have inherited these
tastes: ``People want to be in the environments in which our
species evolved over millions of years: that is, hidden in a copse,
against a rock wall, looking out over savanna and transitional
woodlands at acacias and other similar dominant trees of the
African environment. And why not?'' Animals have a tendency, ``an
inborn guide,'' he said, to go toward the micro-environments that
they need to survive, and so do humans.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the properties of human behavior, he said, are so
natural that people don't even realize they are there. But one day,
he suspects, humans will not only recognize them but understand
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on the threshold of a new theory of art,'' a theory
that will explain human esthetic judgment, he said. In the meantime
it's probably good to remember that one of the things humans like,
one of the things that separates people from termite builders _
other than lawn animals _ is ``that humans metaphorize'' about
their buildings, Wilson said. Termites don't.

WHOSE JOB IS IT TO PROTECT ME AND MINE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Within hours after the shootings at the Wedgwood Baptist Church,
a letter arrived at the ``Star-Telegram'' expressing the wish that
I had been inside the church on that deadly Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I had, too, but for a different reason than the writer's
desire for me to witness the carnage left by two handguns wielded
by a raging paranoid.
</P>
<P>
   At least the seven victims would have had a fighting chance.
</P>
<P>
   Every time this argument is raised by proponents of
concealed-carry permits for private citizens, gun-control advocates
counter that they don't want public venues turned into some
modern-day version of the OK Corral. Firearms should be left to the
professionals, they say _ law enforcement officers trained in their
use.
</P>
<P>
   The first concern has been proved as statistical nonsense. Since
1987, 24 states including Texas have permitted the concealed
carrying of handguns by law-abiding citizens. The country has yet
to experience such an occurrence. Despite macabre hopes to the
contrary, concealed-carry does not lead to bloody rampages. Folks
will have to look elsewhere for the culprits.
</P>
<P>
   The second argument _ leave the guns to the police _ reflects a
naivete that could turn you or your loved ones into victims. As
well-intentioned as every man and woman who wears a badge might be
to protect and serve, it is not now and has never been their job to
protect your individual hide _ or your child's. A slew of court
cases confirm that law enforcement is necessary to help keep peace
throughout society, not to protect individual citizens.
</P>
<P>
   As far as training goes, state certification standards for peace
officers require that they qualify with their firearms once a year.
No other proficiency training is mandated for the average patrol
officer in Texas _ the type of officer who initially will be
dispatched to your house in your time of need _ to take his or her
gun from the holster.
</P>
<P>
   Qualification takes 20 minutes. And it's done while the officer
stands still and shoots at a fixed target in broad daylight. No
night shoots. No moving targets.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, many police departments go beyond what the Texas
Commission on Law Enforcement Officer Standards and Education
requires for officers to keep their licenses, but any police
department training officer speaking honestly will admit that the
rank and file spend precious little time at the gun range.
</P>
<P>
   When the bad guy is crawling through your child's window, do you
want to trust that the police, with an average response time in the
Metroplex of about seven minutes for Priority 1 calls, will be
there in time to help? A lot of damage can be done in that time.
Look what Larry Gene Ashbrook did in less than 10 minutes, with a
police officer at home across the street from the church when the
shooting started.
</P>
<P>
   The argument always turns to a ban on handguns. If no one but
the law had them, then America wouldn't be agonizing over the
sporadic but nightmarish situations that occur when they are
misused. Right?
</P>
<P>
   Let's suppose that Congress does vote to ban private ownership
of handguns. From henceforth, the manufacture, sale and importation
of handguns are forbidden by federal law. Why, that's a strategy
that has worked wonders for illegal narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   As keen as the desire might be among some people for this to be
reality, the experiences of such bans in other nations show the
deficiencies. Take Australia, which recently instituted a
nationwide ban on private ownership of many types of firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Before the ban, 84 percent of the homicides Down Under were
committed with something other than a gun, and the homicide rate
had been level for 80 years. One high-profile case involving a
gunman at a resort was enough to push policy-makers to change the
law.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's homicide rate has risen more than 3 percent since
the surrendering of more than 600,000 guns by law-abiding citizens;
assaults have increased by more than 8 percent; and armed robberies
_ bad guys don't turn in their guns _ have increased 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In England, which is often cited by gun-control activists as a
model for strict gun ownership, people are 40 percent more likely
to be mugged or assaulted than in America, according to a study
done three years ago by the U.S. Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Does the United States have a problem with the misuse of
firearms by a minuscule percentage of the population? Yes. Are
there reasonable steps that can be taken to curtail the potential
for future problems, even though violent crime is statistically
down in this country? Probably.
</P>
<P>
   But telling me and mine that we must rely on law enforcement to
ensure individual safety is a leap of faith I'm not willing to
gamble on.
</P>
<P>
   I'm married to a police officer. I have my own security detail
living under the same roof. Guess who's the one in the family to
insist that we spend time at the shooting range?
</P>
<P>
   He knows better than anyone that the only person who can give me
a fighting chance to survive an attack is me.

 (ATTN: Fla.)  
 WHIDDON CAN'T WALK, BUT HE'S A WORLD CHAMPION WATER SKIER  (mk) 
 By DICK SCANLON   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   POLK CITY, Fla. _ At one time, Clay Whiddon was a natural as a
water skier. That is no longer the case, although he is a world
champion.
</P>
<P>
   Whiddon grew up near Lake Arianna in Auburndale and learned to
love the water early in life. By the time he reached the age of 21,
he could do just about anything behind a boat with a rope in his
hands _ with or without skis.
</P>
<P>
   That all changed abruptly in a single-car accident 14 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit a tree. The steering wheel went through my chest and
killed my spinal cord,'' Whiddon said. ``I'm very fortunate. They
told me I'd never walk again.''
</P>
<P>
   For about nine months, Whiddon was completely paralyzed in a
wheelchair. Getting up on skis wasn't something he cared to think
about, even after he was informed it was being done by disabled
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of had a little ego problem then,'' he said. ``If I
couldn't ski like I used to ski, I didn't want to ski at all.''
</P>
<P>
   So for more than a decade, he didn't. He raced Go-Karts for a
while, studied computer systems at the University of South Florida
and gradually regained the use of most of his body. Whiddon learned
that a lot of people are far worse off physically than he is and
that some of them are serious water skiers.
</P>
<P>
   That was his first step toward winning the overall gold medal in
the MP3 division at the World Disabled Water Ski Championships last
month. He competed on a sit-ski, a water ski adapted so it can be
maneuvered from a seated position.
</P>
<P>
   Whiddon went to Heron Lake in Wraysbury, Middlesex, Great
Britain, as a complete unknown and came home with five medals. One
of the gold medals was for being a member of the champion American
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there as an alternate,'' said Whiddon, who had to
qualify for the team last year. ``Then somebody got hurt at the
nationals, and I went in and it was just kind of my week. Plus, I
had gotten better. In '98, when I qualified for World, I was new at
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The tournament's official program includes no mention of the
35-year-old Whiddon, who set a world MP3 record in trick skiing
(1,010 points), won a silver medal in slalom and finished fifth in
jumping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty much a newcomer,'' he said. ``Most of the people at
that level have been doing it for a number of years. But being from
around here and having skied before was a great advantage, and now
I think I can continue to compete at this level for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   To do that will require a lot of traveling and, at some point, a
sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   The MP3 Class is for paraplegics who are the least disabled.
There are tests and strict guidelines placing skiers in their
respective classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very grateful to be able to do the things I can,'' said
Whiddon, who lives in Polk City and trains five days a week nearby
at the Lake Hamilton Water Sports ski school. ``I'm on the upper
end of disability.
</P>
<P>
   He said when he first heard about sit-skiing, he didn't think
many people would be interested. ``But when I got back into it, I
found it was very competitive,'' he said. ``It's been a great
challenge.''

THE WEB HASN'T REPLACED THE STOREFRONT QUITE YET  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 3) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   More bad news for bricks-and-mortar retailers: A new survey has
found that 30 percent of the personal computers bought by American
households in the last six months were purchased directly from the
manufacturer. That represents a sharp jump _ up more than a half _
from the previous six months, according to the market research firm
Odyssey, based on its twice-yearly surveys of the technology buying
habits of 2,500 American households.
</P>
<P>
   The trend should further strengthen the position of Dell
Computer and Gateway, the leading direct marketers of PCs. It can
also be seen as a more general sign of things to come. After all,
Internet commerce is merely the direct-sales model on steroids, as
Michael Dell says, with customers and suppliers enjoying an
electronic connection, any time, any place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The businesses that should be most concerned are the
retailers,'' said Nicholas Donatiello, president of Odyssey in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In some industries _ computers, travel, banking _ the Internet
direct sales threat is severe, to be sure. But the notion that
people are about to do any substantial portion of their overall
buying online is suspect, if not downright nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, few things drive home that point more clearly than a
recent study on the outlook for online retailing from Forrester
Research, which is regarded as an unequivocal bull on E-commerce.
And it is the kind of research that helps put in perspective some
of the revolutionary rhetoric about the ``new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Forrester's widely quoted projections on the growth of online
sales have a hockey-stick trajectory, and its report issued two
weeks ago is no exception. In fact, the forecasts in its new report
have been revised upward: Forrester now expects online retail sales
in the United States to rise sharply this year, to more than $20
billion.
</P>
<P>
   By 2004, Forrester predicts that retail sales over the Internet
should reach $185 billion _ a huge number, representing striking
growth. Still, even assuming that this heady forecast proves
accurate, the $185 billion will be just 7 percent of total retail
sales in the United States, Forrester reports.
</P>
<P>
   Guess who accounts for the other 93 percent? ``Obviously, the
bricks-and-mortar world is not going away,'' noted David
Cooperstein, an analyst for Forrester.
</P>
<P>
   The modest lesson here is that a passing familiarity with
economic statistics is a useful tool for anyone trying to make
sense of the Internet-driven new economy. Yes, there is a lot of
growth, excitement and substance to the Internet economy.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a lot of hype and churning and many failed
start-ups _ but that is all part of the process of entrepreneurial
endeavor. Hype encourages investment, which accelerates the
innovation cycle of trial and error, leading to growth-creating
breakthroughs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the attention given to Internet companies, they
still represent mainly an innovative ferment on the surface of the
nation's economy. As Kevin Kelly, editor at large of Wired magazine
and author of ``New Rules for the New Economy'' (Viking Press), has
noted, the new economy doesn't replace the old economy; it builds
on top of the old, and its technologies eventually permeate the
underlying layers.
</P>
<P>
   In America's $8.5 trillion economy, that two-step process will
not happen overnight, even if the Internet enthusiasts are correct
in saying it is inevitable. Recognizing that reality, Forrester
called its recent report ``post-Web retailing.''
</P>
<P>
   Established retailers from Wal-Mart to Tiffany are already
building up Internet presences, and more will follow. But as
Cooperstein of Forrester sees it, the future belongs to those who
pursue a ``multichannel strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Look no further for a pioneer of that future than Gateway.
Starting in 1997, Gateway began opening retail stores across the
country _ 180 so far, heading for 400 over the next few years. But
they are retail stores with a difference, likened to petting zoos
for PCs, so people can come in and try out the Gateway machines,
which are all connected to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   These stores have no inventory on shelves in the back room.
Customers place orders and receive delivery a few days later at
their homes. So all the advantages of scale of Gateway's direct
business model _ made-to-order manufacturing, warehousing and
delivery _ remain intact.
</P>
<P>
   Further and more futuristic second thoughts on Internet
retailing can be found in an intriguing research paper by Hal R.
Varian, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley.
In his paper, Varian raises questions about economic efficiency and
consumer benefits often predicted for Internet shopping _ a world,
it is said, in which a person's ``software agent'' will roam the
Net on his behalf, seeking the best bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but perhaps not, Varian says, if the predicted shakeout
occurs in some online markets. He looks at two established
electronic markets with a limited number of suppliers _ airline
computerized reservations systems like Sabre and market makers in
NASDAQ stocks _ and suggests that a result can be price-signaling
and implicit collusion among those suppliers. At NASDAQ, of course,
a price-fixing investigation was prompted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody says the Internet will be a consumer paradise,''
Varian said. ``But it is not so clear that consumers will be the
winners in the long run.''

IMPASSIONED BEATTY ADDS TWIST TO POLITICAL SEASON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Warren Beatty's last movie role was a naive
politician. What would be so strange then about his moving to a
real-life campaign for president?
</P>
<P>
   A White House bid by the 62-year-old Hollywood legend would be a
piquant turn for an actor long given to liberal causes and just one
more twist in a political season that may be far more interesting
than seemed possible a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Not many associates _ in the movie business or Washington _
believe Beatty will ultimately take the plunge, but he has not
ruled it out.
</P>
<P>
   A phalanx of journalists from around the world gathered
Wednesday night at a Beverly Hills hotel to await word as Beatty
received an award from the Southern California chapter of the
liberal Americans for Democratic Action.
</P>
<P>
   Insiders predicted yet another tease. And they were right.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of an impassioned defense of his liberal agenda,
including a call for recognition of Fidel Castro's Cuba, Beatty
coyly addressed a mythical drum majorette who might be considering
a presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no harm in thinking about this, however unlikely it
may be,'' Beatty told a ballroom full of fellow left-wingers who
had whooped it up throughout his remarks. ``But whatever you do, go
ahead and speak up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speak up for the people nobody speaks for. Maybe you'll
influence some people. Maybe you'll influence the party. Maybe
you'll influence the candidates who are running.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his remarks Beatty expressed dissatisfaction with the
two candidates for the Democratic nomination, Vice President Al
Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, and only modest
hope they might find their way to a more liberal path.
</P>
<P>
   In closing, Beatty urged his audience: ``Keep talking. Keep the
spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   That apparently is what Beatty plans to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll assess it and decide whether he's serious or not,'' said
one of Beatty's political friends as the crowd filed out of the
Beverly Hilton, some disappointed they had not gotten a clearer
sign from a famously enigmatic figure.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, say political operatives with Hollywood connections,
Beatty is most interested _ as he has made clear _ in affecting the
debate, especially in the Democratic Party, which he believes has
become too comfortable and too inattentive to its historic
constituency among the less well off.
</P>
<P>
   This may seem anomalous for a wealthy actor, director, writer,
producer _ and former playboy _ who lives with his actress-wife,
Annette Bening (who has already played the president's girlfriend,
but opposite Michael Douglas), and a growing young family in the
Hollywood Hills.
</P>
<P>
   But not, perhaps, for a movie man whose last film was
``Bulworth,'' in which he starred as a Democratic senator from
California who has a nervous breakdown in the midst of the
intellect-dulling nature of high-dollar politics and begins to
speak oracular truths _ in rhyming rap as he woos a young woman.
</P>
<P>
   And not strange given the tightening of the race for the
Democratic nomination between Gore and Bradley. Beatty apparently
figures there's no reason he should take himself out of
speculation. A situation might crop up in which a long-shot
outsider with a distinctive message might have a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beatty could be a very strong candidate, could be a very fine
president,'' said former Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., who sought
his party's presidential nomination in 1984. ``He's been working in
politics and campaigns for 35 years. He knows the issues upside
down and backwards. He's never going to be caught making some
blunder because he doesn't understand some issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging by his speech Wednesday, Beatty would be the most
unabashedly liberal candidate in a major party since the Rev. Jesse
Jackson sought the Democratic nomination in 1984 and 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Early in his remarks, Beatty described himself as ``an old time,
unrepentant, unreconstructed, tax and spend, bleeding heart, tax
and spend Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in the value of social programs,'' he said. ``I
believe in the safety net. I believe in regulation. And I believe
in active government.''
</P>
<P>
   Beatty was most pointed in criticizing what he sees as the
self-satisfaction of the Clinton-Gore administration with the
economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we gloat about prosperity when the poverty level
hasn't changed at all?'' Beatty demanded.
</P>
<P>
   After ticking off some bad economic indicators, Beatty asked:
``Do we have a party that quietly shoves this stuff under the rug
and says, 'Most things are going right for America...?' What would
Hubert Humphrey say today?''
</P>
<P>
   Beatty blasted what he sees as Democratic complicity in
sacrificing labor and environmental interests to the increasingly
international economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need a third party. We need a second party,'' Beatty
declared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have we come to the point where the Democratic Party needs to
have a Republican president before it finds its voice again?''
Beatty asked. ``A rising tide is not lifting all boats.''
</P>
<P>
   But Beatty sought to draw a bright line between his views on
global economics and the protectionist proposals of Pat Buchanan,
who may quit his race for the Republican presidential nomination
and seek to be the Reform Party candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat Buchanan is wrong,'' Beatty said. ``We can't build a wall
or turn our backs. We have to work with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beatty boomlet began last month when speculation about his
prospective candidacy appeared in a column by Arianna Huffington, a
generally conservative gadfly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if he doesn't run, he will have shaken up the ossified
system,'' Huffington said as she arrived for the dinner, clearly
thrilled with having stirred the political pot.
</P>
<P>
   Her championing of a Beatty candidacy has drawn barbs. Fellow
columnist Mark Shields, a center-left Democrat, said it was as if
Anthony Lewis, the liberal New York Times columnist had promoted a
presidential candidacy by actor Charlton Heston, the conservative
activist and gun-rights spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty seemed to rule out a campaign in an op-ed piece that ran
newspapers in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 35 years of liberal activism as a Democrat, I am being
urged by some people to spend 40 years of fame on a presidential
campaign,'' Beatty said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no wish to diminish the capable, cautious centrists Al
Gore and Bill Bradley, who have unselfishly devoted much of their
lives to public service when they could so easily have enriched
themselves in the private sector, as I have.''
</P>
<P>
   But after an indictment of the party's current stance on issues
foreign and domestic and a call for public financing of all federal
campaigns, Beatty tantalizingly signed off with: ``Stay tuned.
We'll be back after this message.''
</P>
<P>
   The dinner crowd of about 1,000 included a glittering
cross-section of the Hollywood Left: Hustler publisher Larry Flynt,
Courtney Love, Dustin Hoffman, Faye Dunaway (who played Bonnie to
Beatty's Clyde), Morgan Fairchild, Mike Farrell.
</P>
<P>
   A taped presentation praising Beatty started rolling with Barbra
Streisand and ended with historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. urging
the actor to ``Keep up the debate, Warren, and let us save our
party.''
</P>
<P>
   In between, were cameos that included: Rob Reiner, former Texas
Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower, Penny Marshall, Goldie
Hawn, Paul Newman and Sean Penn. The heavily reconstructed Roseanne
asked Beatty to include free plastic surgery in his health plan,
and comedian Gary Shandling, in true Hollywood fashion, urged the
actor to seek billing ``above the country,'' as in ``Warren Beatty
in the United States of America.`` Beatty was introduced by
producer Norman Lear, founder of the liberal advocacy group People
for the American Way, who encouraged him to ``kick some tires.''
</P>
<P>
   No sooner was the Beatty dinner over than Hollywood was
tantalized by the news that Arnold Schwarzenegger might run for
governor of California as a Republican in 2002. He'd have to stop
there, however, as the federal Constitution requires presidents be
native-born _ and he's a naturalized citizen, having been born in
Austria.

CRIME LACED WITH ROMANCE MAKES FOR A DEFENSIBLE `ALIBI'

   ``The Alibi''
</P>
<P>
   By Sandra Brown
</P>
<P>
   Fiction
</P>
<P>
   Warner, $25.95
</P>
<P>
   ``The Alibi,'' Sandra Brown's latest novel, isn't completely
ironclad, but it is well worth investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Straight-arrow Charleston assistant district attorney Hammond
Cross (an assistant county solicitor in Southern-speak) stops by a
county fair to blow off some steam and ends up in a very sticky
situation (no, not cotton candy). Within hours of meeting a mystery
woman at the fair, he ends up tangled in a web of sex, lies and
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``The Alibi'' gets off to a promising, steamy start, it
suffers a mild case of predictability. You know Cross will resort
to ``redial'' to get a lead on the mystery woman at least a page
before he actually does it. And the ending, in particular, holds no
surprises. There's also a problem with continuity. At the end of
one chapter, a character leaps to her feet to defend herself. At
the beginning of the next chapter, her attorney tells her to stand
up, they're leaving. But this is a minor flaw that should have been
caught by a sharp-eyed editor.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Brown throws a few curveballs I didn't see coming.
She kept me guessing until the very end about the identity of the
killer, and she tosses in some surprises that interconnect
characters, much like an episode of the dearly departed ``Melrose
Place.'' She's also adept at jumping from one location to another
to build suspense, a tactic that can backfire and leave some
readers confused in the hands of lesser writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Alibi'' is sure to be a movie of the week _ a casting
agent's dream. The characters are engaging, and Brown does a nice
job of adding them to the story unexpectedly, making the reader
wonder what's around the corner, and how can this person possibly
be involved? But the story bogs down when it gets to Cross and the
mystery woman, who suffer from too much thinking out loud in the
form of questions. For example, Hammond Cross ponders: ``How could
one, anyone describe the instant when it all comes together? How to
describe that burst of clarity when one knows that his life has
only just now begun, that everything that's happened before was rot
compared to this, and that nothing will ever be the same again?''
It's nice to know what's on the characters' minds, but not in the
form of 20 flowery questions.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the characters aren't so besotted, and a couple are
refreshingly funny. One comment made me laugh out loud. (Sorry, I
can't repeat it in a family newspaper.)
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Brown fans won't be disappointed by ``The Alibi;'' but
hard-core mystery fans may judge it good but not great. Melding
romance and mystery is tricky, and jaded mystery aficionados are
difficult to shock. ``The Alibi'' shows that Sandra Brown has what
it takes to churn out a good mystery. She just needs to use less
talk and more action to make one first-rate.

FINNEY DOMINATES `ENGLISH MARRIAGE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
A RATHER ENGLISH MARRIAGE 
Starring: Albert Finney, Tom Courtenay, Joanna Lumley, 
Directed by: Paul Seed 
On: PBS, Sunday at 9 p.m. 
Rated: TVPG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With his booming voice, Albert Finney is a thunderstorm of an
actor, and never more so than in ``A Rather English Marriage,'' the
first ``Masterpiece Theatre'' of the series's 29th season. Finney
plays a gruff, hard-drinking old coot named Reggie who likes to be
addressed as ``Squadron Leader'' by ordinary people, including the
hookers he visits. When his long-suffering wife dies, he mutters
``Look on the bright side'' and heads to the local bar to pickle
his vague sorrows. The phrase ``self-absorbed'' understates
Reggie's state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Courtenay, too, is a force of nature, although the quiet
persistence of his style is more like a slowly accumulating
snowfall. In ``A Rather English Marriage,'' he plays the low-key
Roy, a retired milkman and mother hen who is happiest when serving
others. After his domineering wife dies, he loyally addresses her
photograph, lonely without any whims to cater to. And he visits his
son in prison every week, despite the bitter young man's verbal
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, this odd couple of widowers make beautiful music
together. ``A Rather English Marriage'' is a rather unusual
second-time-around story that adds more shadings to its male-couple
theme than you might expect. Reuniting the two actors from ``The
Dresser,'' this British production is for Finney and Courtenay what
the ``Grumpy Old Men'' movies were for Jack Lemmon and Walter
Matthau _ a new vehicle to revive old chemistry. But unlike the
``Grumpy Old Men'' movies, ``A Rather English Marriage'' relies on
cool, engaging melodrama and not on sentimentality and shtick.
</P>
<P>
   The two men meet in the hospital while visiting their dying
spouses. Once the wives pass on the same day, Roy pursues Reggie's
friendship, and soon he moves in with Reggie as his manservant and
buddy. They have a perfectly interlocking psychological dynamic,
one that happens to mirror each of their long marriages. They
realize this instinctively, and they never discuss their
friendship, or question it. All they know is that Roy is content
preparing meals for Reggie, and Reggie is content to sit back and
sing the praises of Roy's cooking.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Rather English Marriage,'' which won a British Academy of
Film and Television Arts Award for best single drama, features two
scenes in which Roy and Reggie dance together in the living room.
It's the rare movie that can pull off such moments without
resorting to humor, or alluding to the torment of latent gay
desires. And Finney and Courtenay are remarkable as they
consistently avoid defining the friendship with easy cliches. Both
characters have had bad luck in the child department, but neither
actor resorts to sympathy-mongering or bathos as their secrets
unfold.
</P>
<P>
   Joanna Lumley also adds luster to ``A Rather English Marriage''
as the boutique owner who appears to fall for Reggie. Lumley, Patsy
from ``Absolutely Fabulous,'' is oddly touching as a woman whose
questionable motives are softened by her acute self-knowledge. She
thinks Reggie is rich, unaware that his wife has left her fortune
to her nieces. In a powerful scene that doesn't become evasive
simply because the characters are older, she and Reggie make love.
Like the rest of ``A Rather English Marriage,'' it grants the
characters dignity, illusion, and loneliness.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   A generally dry pattern will prevail across the eastern half of
the nation as westerly winds above the ground hinder the northward
advance of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. However, a low
pressure system over Ontario will glean moisture from the Great
Lakes, setting the stage for spotty showers, mainly across
Michigan. The forecast for the Michigan-Purdue football game at Ann
Arbor will be mostly cloudy and cool with a chance for showers.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of the system, a shield of high clouds will stream into
western New York and west-central New England, gradually dimming
the sun. On the western flank of the low, rain mixed with snow will
fall across Michigan's Upper Peninsula as cold air streaming across
Lake Superior is moistened in transit and lifted overland.
</P>
<P>
   Chilly air will dive southward across the Great Plains, reaching
the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma, as a broad ridge of high
pressure builds south from Canada. Snow will develop from the Black
Hills of South Dakota to the Big Horn Mountains of Wyoming as moist
winds from the southeast associated with the high glide up the
sloping terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated showers and thunderstorms, a few of which could produce
moderately heavy rain, will develop later Saturday near the east
coast of Florida in concert with the sea breeze moving inland.
Isolated thunderstorms are also possible in extreme south Texas in
response to a sea breeze. Meanwhile, an area of clouds with very
spotty light rain will arrive over the middle Mississippi Valley
later Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Computer Fire
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, an electrical fire knocked the fastest computer at
the National Centers for Environment Prediction in Washington,
D.C., out of commission. This division provides computer guidance
to weather forecasters across the nation. With the loss of the fast
computer, guidance distributed to forecasters has been diminished
and less timely. Fortunately, the weather pattern across the nation
has quieted down, reducing the need for a high volume of timely
computer forecasts. For example, without the threat of an Atlantic
tropical storm, there has been no need for hurricane computer
guidance.

ANNUAL SOCIAL SECURITY STATEMENTS MAY HELP BOOMERS PLAN  
(HLW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROL BENFELL   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ It used to be that one of the first signs
of advancing age came at 50, with an invitation in the mail to join
the American Association of Retired Persons. But soon all of us
will be getting annual reminders of our mortality in the form of
retirement statements from the federal Social Security
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning on Friday, Social Security will mail individual
estimates of future benefits to wage-earners over 25, a change from
times past when a worker had to write to the agency and request a
statement in order to do financial planning.
</P>
<P>
   Some 125 million wage-earners will receive the annual statement,
which will arrive about three months before each person's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Congress mandated the $70-million annual mailing after a poll
showed those who received statements had a better understanding of
how Social Security works.
</P>
<P>
   The annual mailing comes at a time when baby boomers are edging
toward retirement age and the number of people on Social Security
is expected to increase. People also are living longer and are
drawing more benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The statements are expected to be particularly relevant to the
boomers, who, more than their parents, find they need to do their
own financial planning for retirement. As traditional pensions
disappear, the boomers will need to juggle Social Security, 401(k)
plans and other investments to provide for their futures.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security earlier tried to make the information available
over the Internet. Wage-earners could type in their Social Security
numbers and get statements of earnings and benefits on the spot.
But privacy concerns and fears the information would be
appropriated for criminal use led the agency to close the site
temporarily. It has since reopened, at www.ssa.gov, but a statement
is available only by mail.
</P>
<P>
   The four-page statement being mailed out annually will contain
several kinds of information. One section lists the agency's
records of past earnings, year by year. It's important to make sure
the list is accurate, because eventual retirement benefits will be
based on it.
</P>
<P>
   Another section of the statement projects the amount individuals
will receive at retirement, using the examples of age 62, the
earliest you can receive Social Security; your ``retirement age,''
which is between 65 and 67, depending on your birthday; and age 70.
You can retire and receive benefits any time after you reach 62,
but you are penalized for retiring early and given a premium for
working longer.
</P>
<P>
   The statement is also a reminder that you can draw benefits if
you are disabled before retirement and that your children and your
spouse also may be entitled to benefits if you are disabled and
when you die. It also estimates what those benefits might be.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing about survivors' benefits is important, because the
burden is on family members to apply for benefits. Social Security
doesn't take responsibility for notifying them that they may be
eligible.
</P>
<P>
   The first rule of Social Security is that you don't get Social
Security benefits if you don't pay Social Security taxes.
Consequently, many public school teachers, local and state
government workers and others on civil service won't be receiving
statements. Federal government workers will get statements,
however, because they began paying into Social Security in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   If you do pay Social Security taxes, you need a minimum of 10
years of work to receive benefits. The amount you receive is
generally based on your lifetime earnings. However, if your annual
income exceeds the Social Security maximum, which is currently
$72,600, your benefits will be based on the maximum, which changes
from year to year.
</P>
<P>
   To figure your benefit, the agency adjusts your earnings for
inflation and then picks your 35 highest earning years. A
complicated formula is used to determine the exact amount of your
monthly benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security currently is providing about 40 percent of a
retiree's income, according to agency figures. Some 27.5 million
retired wage-earners currently receive Social Security, with an
average benefit of $780 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Another formula is used for those who want to retire earlier or
later than their Social Security retirement age. It used to be that
a person received full retirement benefits at 65, but recent
changes in the law extended the age so that currently, for workers
born after 1937, retirement age ranges from 65 1/2 to 67.
</P>
<P>
   If you retire before your Social Security retirement age, your
monthly benefit will be 0.56 percent less for each month you retire
early. If you retire after your retirement age, your monthly
benefit will include a bonus of up to 0.67 percent for each month
you delay. For example, a worker born in 1960, with earnings of
$68,400 a year, would receive about $1,105 a month at age 62, about
$1,580 a month at retirement age of 67 in this case and about
$1,905 a month at age 70.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security is usually thought of as a retirement tool, but
about one out of every three Social Security recipients is a
disabled worker or a family member of a deceased or disabled
worker. Their benefits stem from their relationship to the
wage-earner and are based on his or her earnings.

MEDICARE HMO SHAKE-UP TAKING HEAVIEST TOLL IN SMALLER COMMUNITIES

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The turmoil in Medicare's managed care initiative
has sent older Americans in some cities scrambling to find new
coverage after their health maintenance organizations
unceremoniously pulled out. But at least those seniors had
alternatives available to them.
</P>
<P>
   In smaller communities, the HMO options under the troubled
Medicare Plus Choice program are drying up entirely if they ever
existed in the first place. Recent reports from the White House and
an interest group found that HMOs are scarce in rural America and
becoming rarer, forsaking the very communities that need them most.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the report by the group Families USA disclosed,
almost 75 percent of the more than 9 million Medicare beneficiaries
living in rural counties are not served by any HMO. Just one in 10
resides in a county that has two or more managed care plans from
which to choose.
</P>
<P>
   In 13 states _ Alaska, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky,
Mississippi, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota,
Utah, Vermont and Wyoming _ rural residents have no HMO option. In
another 12, the choices are greatly restricted. In Alabama, for
instance, only one rural county out of 46 has a Medicare HMO.
</P>
<P>
   ``The managed care industry has virtually ignored Medicare
beneficiaries in rural communities,'' declared Ron Pollack,
executive director of the liberal watchdog organization.
</P>
<P>
   The White House report, which focused on the decline in drug
coverage provided by Medicare HMOs, found that only one-fifth of
rural beneficiaries had access to a health plan that provided
prescription benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The consequences of this lack of health care choice in
small-town America are significant for the residents, who are
older, less healthy and less affluent than their urban counterparts
and are thus more dependent on Medicare. The scarcity of HMOs means
beneficiaries have no opportunity to obtain the drug coverage,
wellness protection and other extra benefits offered by managed
care plans to attract customers.
</P>
<P>
   Both studies confirmed the suspicions of many lawmakers and
senior advocates that Medicare beneficiaries in rural communities
are at a serious disadvantage when it comes to managed care.
</P>
<P>
   These critics say a flawed funding formula based in part on past
Medicare spending has driven up federal managed care reimbursement
rates in urban areas, where health care usage is high, while
penalizing rural areas for conservative medical practice. Take the
case in Florida, where HMOs in Miami's Dade County are paid $778
per month per HMO enrollee compared to the $452 HMOS would be
entitled to if they served largely rural Hamilton County in North
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, HMOs have clustered in large population centers
while moving more slowly into areas beyond the suburbs. And as
managed care companies pull out of areas due to their ongoing
struggles with Medicare, rural counties are often the first to be
jettisoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is, in business you go where there is
the best return and the heck with everybody else,'' said Rep. Karen
Thurman, D-Fla., who has pushed for Medicare HMO reforms intended
to draw more plans into rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the managed care industry has lobbied for higher
reimbursement rates, saying companies can only provide services in
areas where they are adequately compensated.
</P>
<P>
   The Families USA report said factors other than reimbursement
rates are at work in keeping HMOs out of rural areas. Besides the
general problems of a limited number of enrollees and fewer health
care providers and facilities, the report said HMO companies find
it difficult to wring savings out of rural health care systems
since health care spending is already low.
</P>
<P>
   ``HMOs _ at least as they are currently structured _ may be an
inherently unsuitable system of health delivery for rural areas,''
said the Families USA report, entitled ``Rural Neglect.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the White House and the interest group offered their
findings in support of President Clinton's reform plan and said any
alternative that relies on competition among HMOs _ as several
circulating on Capitol Hill do _ will further harm rural Americans.
The group says reform must be done in a way that guarantees that
Medicare benefits remain affordable and available to all
beneficiaries equally.
</P>
<P>
   It is still unclear how or if Congress will make any substantive
changes to Medicare yet this session. But it is clear that the
effort to expand the availability of HMOs is not now reaching rural
America.

 &HT;    `Farm' presents beastly specter of Stalinism
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TNT's ``Animal Farm'' is an epic near-miss. It's the kind of TV
movie you wish TV attempted more often. Airing at 8 p.m. Sunday,
``Animal Farm'' is startling and ambitious and harrowing and bold _
all virtues that should add up to something triumphant and not
merely noble. Yet the fact that it makes you wish for more than
mere nobility is a kind of triumph in itself. ``Animal Farm'' is TV
as moral victory.
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour, $23 million film is an adaptation of George
Orwell's classic political fable, a 1945 novel famous to many high
school students, one critic has put it, as ``the Shortest Serious
Novel It's OK to Write a Book Report About'' (it edges out
Hemingway's ``The Old Man and the Sea'' by three pages). The book
endures for many reasons, not the least being the affecting,
brazenly simple way it morphs the atrocities of Soviet Communism
under Joseph Stalin into a believable barnyard society.
</P>
<P>
   This is a world where the animals of Manor Farm overthrow their
oppressive human masters and set up a one-for-all, all-for-one
utopia. Anybody recall the Bolshevik revolution? Doesn't matter.
Manor Farm is quickly redubbed Animal Farm, a place where ``four
legs are good, two legs are bad,'' where animals are animals and
not tools for others' gain.
</P>
<P>
   Things go along like this until power corrupts the pigs, who
concoct a corrupt dictatorship of their own. They employ propaganda
films, a secret security force and paranoia. Anybody recall Stalin?
Doesn't matter. Things turn worse than before.
</P>
<P>
   Only today, in the age of ``Babe,'' could the book be plausibly
adapted as a live-action film. (A 1955 feature was animated. In
fact, this production, from executive producer Robert Halmi Sr.
(``Merlin,'' ``Alice in Wonderland''), is crafted by much of the
same crew that created that heralded 1995 film: Jim Henson's
Creature Shop built 14 farm animals, and John Stephenson directs.
</P>
<P>
   Their work here is as realistic as it gets, though there's
always something self-consciously curious, if still thrilling,
about watching a dog or a horse or a pig move its lips properly to
speak the queen's English.
</P>
<P>
   But the film's staggering atmospherics extend beyond special
effects. Filmed in Ireland, there's a lush bleakness bled into
every scene that perfectly frames this tale's theme of ideals gone
awfully wrong. Even when characters are portrayed with a kind of
cartoonish heavy-handedness, the film never loses its weight.
Animals might talk, but this ``Animal Farm'' isn't for kids.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when you're more amazed by what you're seeing than
engrossed in what you're watching, something fundamental is amiss.
That's often the case here.
</P>
<P>
   The real defect is hidden in the movie's strength: the animals
so wonderously created by the Creature Shop. They have life, but
little depth. An oppressed horse is pretty much the same as an
oppressed goose or mule or sheep _ no matter which celebrity voices
it (Kelsey Grammer, Ian Holm, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Patrick Stewart,
Julia Ormand, Peter Ustinov). The animals are more sympathetic than
the humans, but also flatter. We root for them in the simple way we
root for the good guy in a wrestling match.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Postlethwaite (``In the Name of the Father''), brilliant as
the pathetically heinous Jones, the drunk farmer against whom the
animals originally revolt, is seen as both the oppressor and the
oppressed. He's crude and complex, and ultimately more gratifying
to despise than the animals are to embrace.
</P>
<P>
   By the time you reach its contrived, un-Orwellian end, ``Animal
Farm'' isn't the memorable TV movie it could have been. But it is a
memorable attempt.

 &HT;    1999 Georgia American Institute of Architects Design Awards
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Oct. 3.
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The construction of a new department store in an old
downtown is an event in itself, and architects at the Atlanta firm
Cooper Carry Inc. celebrate the occasion with an urbane design that
tips its hat to tradition without losing its modernity.
</P>
<P>
   The Lazarus Department Store in Pittsburgh, the first
free-standing store to be built there in 25 years, is a grand
building in the spirit of Marshall Field's in Chicago or Macy's in
Atlanta. Its highly articulated facades, which give the building
scale and character, were inspired by the sturdiness, texture and
vertical rhythms of the early 20th-century structures nearby, such
as H.H. Richardson's Allegheny County Courthouse. Vertical bands of
windows sliced with mullions break up the facade further and call
attention to the entrances below them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike our mall department stores, we placed the entrances on
the corners,'' Jerry Cooper says. ``They line up with the
crosswalks at the intersections, the way pedestrians approach the
building.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury for the 1999 Georgia American Institute of Architects
Design Awards, which gave the store one of three top awards this
year, was particularly appreciative of the old-style monumentality
and copious use of natural light. Beyond the qualities of the
building itself, Lazarus is, says jury chairman Stephen Muse, ``a
great piece of urban design.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The best work among the 80-some entries went beyond the
building itself to play a larger role in the environment,'' says
Muse, a Washington architect.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Heery International's additions to Darrell K.
Royal-Texas Stadium at the University of Texas in Austin created
more than seats and skyboxes, Muse says. The project, whose
monumentality and decorative flourishes bring to mind Atlanta's
Turner Field, which Heery also designed, enhances the campus,
giving it a front facade.
</P>
<P>
   Muse describes the third honor award winner, the Lee B. Philmon
Branch Library in Riverdale, as ``a great piece of highway
architecture.''
</P>
<P>
   The attention to detail alone distinguishes this small but
elegant library, which uses triangular windows and skylights to
welcome light inside. Scogin Elam and Bray Architects designed the
casework and tables to complete the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The library plays other roles in the community. As Carol
Stewart, director of library services for Clayton County, explains,
``Riverdale is so chaotic; Merrill (Elam) wanted to create a quiet
refuge.'' Stewart and the firm have teamed up on two other
libraries to earn a reputation for adventurous architecture, which
serves to announce that the library is a special, exciting place to
visit.
</P>
<P>
   The following merit awards _ like the honor awards, all going to
Atlanta firms _ will be presented Saturday in Atlanta during the
Georgia AIA chapter's annual convention. Here's a rundown:

 &HT;    Atlanta College of Art builds a reputation amid tight quarters,
creative classes and culture clashes
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Oct. 3.
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Antonio Garcia started taking classes at the Art
Institute of Chicago while in elementary school. Then an awful
thing happened.
</P>
<P>
   His parents moved to Peachtree City (GA.). ``All I wanted to do
was get back to Chicago,'' says the 20-year-old, remembering his
junior year in high school. ``That was the plan. I just wanted to
finish school and go back home.''
</P>
<P>
   But in 1997, he enrolled at the Atlanta College of Art, moving
into its residence hall behind the High Museum of Art. The dorm,
where baggy jeans, pink hair, tribal dance music and pot-smoking
are part of the status quo, is the last refuge of Bohemianism in
the button-down world of the Woodruff Arts Center.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, things were looking up for Garcia. Then he met his
roommate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when he was eating a bowl of cereal on Friday
and I said goodbye to him and went home,'' says the advertising
design major, now a resident assistant at the 35 Lombardy Way dorm.
He stretches out on his unmade bed, stares at a ``Taxi Driver''
poster showing a young Robert De Niro with a gun and a Mohawk, and
continues: ``I came back Monday morning and the bowl of cereal was
still out in the living room and the whole place smelled like a cow
died in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Living in tight quarters has never been easy.
</P>
<P>
   So even as Garcia settles into his junior year _ with several
scholarships, a 3.9 grade point average and a roommate that he
likes _ the 71-year-old liberal arts college is undergoing its own
growing pains.
</P>
<P>
   As Italian architect Renzo Piano sketches a new master plan for
the Woodruff, including an addition to the High Museum of Art that
is expected to displace the college dorm and sculpture studio, the
school is enjoying unprecedented enrollment growth and an excellent
academic reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Ellen Meyer, the college president, met with the Piano
workshop to discuss construction, which she expects to be completed
within three years. More tangibly, since February, the college has
raised $3.4 million of a $4 million campaign that will give its
technological programs a major boost.
</P>
<P>
   There's just one catch: Behind the all-consuming sprawl of the
Woodruff, the ACA seems almost invisible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I tell somebody where I go to school,'' says Janet
Lankford, a senior photography major from Birmingham, ``they are
like, `Oh, the Art Institute,' and I am like, `No, the Atlanta
College of Art! The Woodruff Arts Center!' It's like it's just
hidden. Nobody knows that we are here.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody outside of the academic world, that is.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the school _ which founder Benjamin Shute described in
1928 as ``a bunch of girls standing around in fur coats waiting to
go to the Piedmont Driving Club'' _ is one of the South's most
prestigious art colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The school has really come into its own in the past few years
and is exercising a leadership position, partly in the Southeast,
but it is also positioning itself gradually with respect to the
national scene,'' says Charles Olton, former dean of New York's
Parsons School of Design and former chairman of the Association of
Independent Colleges of Art and Design. Olton credits Meyer _ who
has focused on technology and internationalism and put in place a
rigorous multidisciplinary world studies curriculum _ with the
school's ascent.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a quick turnaround for a college that was almost
closed in the mid-'80s, after running up a $300,000 deficit. When
Ofelia Garcia, Meyer's predecessor, came on board in 1986, she was
given a mandate: Stop the red ink or the college will be closed.
When she left in 1991, she had more than doubled the enrollment and
stabilized the coffers.
</P>
<P>
   Today, all debt has been paid off, and enrollment is at a record
430. The demographic is impressive: 19 percent African-American and
7 percent from foreign countries. Meyer is particularly proud of
the recruitment program that takes her to Seoul, South Korea, to
enlist students every year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its credentials, the school suffers the distinction of
being the least sexy, and least noticed, of the Woodruff siblings:
the High, the Alliance Theatre and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra.
With a $9.8 million budget, it's the smallest of the four
divisions. Yet from tuition, it generates 62 percent of its
operating budget. By comparison, the ASO, the largest division,
earns back only 47 percent of its $23 million budget, and gets the
rest from contributions. The Woodruff gives about $1 million a year
to the college, its most intensive space occupant, and $4.2 million
to the symphony.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a big light saying, `Eat, eat, eat,'' says
Marcia Cohen, who has been a professor of painting and drawing at
the college for nearly 25 years. ``But it's been a very consistent,
a very strong energy. Maybe no one knows we are here, and yet I
think they do know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you actually go in the college or the gallery,'' says
ACA board Chairwoman Sallie Adams Daniel, ``you don't realize how
exciting it is. It's not as exciting as going to a symphony
performance or the Alliance Theatre with Elton John or the High
Museum's impressionism or Picasso exhibit.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt about it: The college is the only institution in
America that is part of a vibrant arts complex that includes a
theater, a symphony and a museum. This remains one of its most
compelling selling points. But as it prospers, some observers
question whether its relationship with the Woodruff is an asset or
a liability.
</P>
<P>
   Does the concept of living together still work?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Woodruff Arts Center should have busted up years
ago,'' says Larry Jens Anderson, who has taught drawing at the ACA
since 1982. ``It's a small town concept to put all the arts on a
city block.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel is more circumspect: ``We are all kind of busting out of
the seams,'' says the Bank of America vice president, who is also
chairman of the Fulton County Arts Council. ``If we can tackle the
space issue, if we can fix that part of it, I still think it's a
great idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Campus life
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Garcia is sitting in his room when Lankford drops by to
show off her new haircut. ``You look so fine, Janet,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia is a slightly stocky kid who wants to go to film school
after graduation. On this day, he's wearing big, baggy bluejeans,
athletic shoes and a baggy gray sweatshirt. There's the beginning
of a goatee on his chin. Over his bed is a ``Trainspotting''
poster, and on another wall there's a Puerto Rican flag. He proudly
tells a visitor that his family is from Puerto Rico, how he likes
to get back to Peachtree City on weekends to load up on his mom's
cooking. But his trips have gotten less frequent as he's adjusted
to dorm life.
</P>
<P>
   Lankford is a svelte 21-year-old who has spent the last few
years making documentary photographs of her grandmother, who has
Alzheimer's. On one wall of her dorm room, there's a
heartbreakingly beautiful portrait of her grandmother, sitting up
in bed. The image is not maudlin or poignant; instead, it captures
the woman in a state of vulnerability and grace. It was shot by a
young photographer who already knows something about mortality and
fading beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Lankford is disturbed over the sale of condoms in the dorm
vending machines. ``I've been fighting that one,'' she says. ``I
just don't agree with it. I just feel like it promotes it.''
</P>
<P>
   She says she became a Christian while still in high school, and
she shows a visitor one of her favorite images. Ripped from Rolling
Stone magazine, and stuck up on the wall by the door, it's a
photograph of Jay Bakker, the youth minister and son of Jim and
Tammy Faye, flexing his muscles and showing off his tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   During the 30 seconds she is in Garcia's room, he taunts her for
being a Miss Goody Two Shoes. She says she's going out to dinner.
He says: ``I never thought you went out. You are such a dorm
body.''
</P>
<P>
   She shoots back: ``I am not!''
</P>
<P>
   ``You go out for Bible study and then go back to your room.''
He's joking but she seems uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   When Lankford leaves, Garcia says he used to have a ``beef ''
with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sophomore year she was my R.A., and it's like anything that
went wrong she blamed it on us. ... She wrote us up for a pipe bomb
that blew up, and we weren't even aware of it. That was the first
time I ever felt discriminated against. But now that we are R.A.'s
together, we've put it all behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   On another visit to the dorm, Lankford tells a visitor about the
time last year when a man got shot on the street next to the dorm.
``It was the students who administered first aid on this guy who
had been shot five times in the head,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``They saw it out their dorm window. He survived. He came back
last year to thank the people who had helped him. They never caught
the guy who did it. Security got a lot better after that. Anybody
could have walked in this building. It almost took somebody getting
killed and then they paid attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia says the most difficult thing he has to do is get tough
with the residents who smoke pot. ``If I smell it, I'm going to
deal with it. I'm not going to let you off because you are my
friend. ... I almost take it as a personal offense, especially if
it's a friend of mine, because they know my situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Both students save about $4,000 a year by working as resident
assistants. Still, the tuition is expensive, $13,180 a year. ``I've
thought a lot about if I could have gotten the same education at
another school for a lot less money,'' Lankford says.

WITH POMP AND PRECISION, CHINA'S MILITARY MARKS 50 YEARS OF
COMMUNISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ With a Soviet-style procession of goose-stepping
troops, tanks, missiles and fighter jets setting the tone for the
parade marking 50 years of communism, China showed off a formidable
armory Friday, even if few of the weapons could match the latest
Western models.
</P>
<P>
   There were no technological surprises to cause gasps in Taiwan
or in Washington. Still, military officials from foreign embassies
here eagerly studied the display through binoculars, viewing some
of China's best anti-aircraft missiles and other systems for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   Yet potential foreign adversaries were not the main intended
audience, Chinese and Western experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military parade is intended to show confidence and
strength, especially domestically,'' said Zhang Yunding, director
of Asia-Pacific Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
``It's to give the people a sense that we have a new China, to let
people feel proud of that rather than to focus only on our current
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Any intimidation of Taiwan is an added benefit, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Pollack, a China specialist at the Rand Corporation in
California, said: ``The leadership wants to signal that it's not
standing still and that it can display this prowess _ at least as
much to its own citizens as to the world at large.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's parade, the first of its kind in 15 years, also served
the political ambitions of Jiang Zemin. In a stiff drive-by review
of the forces from an open-roofed limousine, Jiang aped the late
Deng Xiaoping's performance in 1984 and also showcased his own
position as chairman of the Central Military Commission, as well as
president and general secretary of the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   All this year, preparations for the exacting procession absorbed
a huge share of the military's attention.
</P>
<P>
   If the tanks and jets on display were a generation or so behind
the world's best, the Chinese also displayed mobile short- and
medium-range ballistic missiles that are nearly impossible to
counter effectively.
</P>
<P>
   China still lacks the ability for sustained air and naval
operations that would be necessary to invade well-defended Taiwan,
100 miles off shore and the main focus of Chinese military
planning. And should the United States be drawn into combat, China
would almost certainly be outfought by American ships and planes,
which can strike precisely from hundreds of miles away.
</P>
<P>
   But the mobile missiles on display Friday, which are being
deployed in growing numbers adjacent to Taiwan, could serve in a
sense as equalizers, able to inflict terrible damage on the island
as well as on more distant American bases.
</P>
<P>
   The parade also featured the recently tested DF-31
intercontinental ballistic missile, able to reach parts of the
United States. Unlike China's existing, vulnerable nuclear forces,
this one can be moved about, lending it far greater protection from
surprise attack.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The military chest-thumping comes at a time when the
long-outmoded and underfunded military has gained status in top
political circles and, almost certainly, a new boost in funds for
weapons development and purchases, Chinese and Western military
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Many of China's best weapons, including some fighter jets and
surface-to-air missiles seen Friday as well as naval destroyers and
submarines, have been purchased from Russia. But even with recent
budgetary increases, military spending here remains only a fraction
of that in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The generals' political stock is up these days, experts say,
because the modernization of Chinese forces now seems all the more
urgent.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans' dazzling display of precision bombing in the 1991
Persian Gulf War caused consternation in China's backward military
and led to a major overhaul that is still going on. This spring,
the long-distance prowess showed by the United States in its
bombing campaign against Yugoslavia was, in the words of an army
newspaper here, ``a new wake-up call'' to the Chinese military.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big surprise to the military people,'' Zhang said.
``There's really pressure now to develop high-tech weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   This summer's war of words with Taiwan, too, heightened the
sense of urgency. In the months since Taiwanese President Lee
Teng-hui declared that relations between Taiwan and China should be
conducted on a ``state-to-state'' basis, a statement Beijing took
to be another step toward formal independence, the Chinese press
has been filled with bluster about China's new capacity to easily
vanquish Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   But thus summer's crisis forced China's military and political
leaders to confront how limited their military options actually
are, especially with the specter of American involvement in
Taiwan's defense.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from backward technology, the Chinese military is in the
throes of multiple transitions and its leaders appear especially
anxious to avoid any conflicts in the next few years, outside
experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Burdened with a surplus of troops, a legacy of the old doctrine
of ``people's war,'' the three-million-strong army is trying to
reduce its numbers by another 500,000, after already pruning one
million people in recent years. But the dearth of jobs for
cashiered soldiers is slowing the process.
</P>
<P>
   The military is also supposed to be ending its involvement in
the myriad businesses that helped pay its bills in the past. It is
revamping the organization of forces and is in the midst of a
fundamental rewriting of military doctrine and strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all these traumas, the military put on an impressively
precise show Friday, even if it seemed from another era.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 50th anniversary was a special occasion,'' Zhang said. ``I
think this is probably the last parade of this type.''

 &HT;    Washington relics hit the road
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Oct. 3.
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND _ If you ever wondered why George Washington looks
irritated on the dollar bill, you'll understand when you see one of
the oddest artifacts in all Americana. It's the star attraction of
``Treasures From Mount Vernon,'' an exhibition about the first
president that opens Saturday, Oct. 16, at the Atlanta History
Center.
</P>
<P>
   As schoolchildren kept asking during the show's previous run at
the Virginia Historical Society, ``Where are the teeth?''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes, the presidential dentures. Of all the precious relics
assembled for the traveling exhibition, none seems as personal as
the disembodied set of choppers. They're a mouthful. Carved from
ivory, cow's teeth and perhaps a nut (or is it a peach pit?), the
teeth are rooted in a heavy lead base that was held in Washington's
mouth not by adhesive, but with metal springs. The contraption
looks as uncomfortable as a Clydesdale's bit.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Washington appears almost ready to blow his lunch
in the dollar bill cameo. The likeness is based on the famous
portrait by Gilbert Stuart, who earned Martha Washington's
disapproval by faithfully reproducing the facial distortions caused
by ill-fitting false teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martha hated that portrait,'' says King Laughlin, special
projects director at Mount Vernon.
</P>
<P>
   The Mount Vernon Ladies' Association, the preservation society
that runs Washington's home and tends his flame, organized the
exhibition to mark the 200th anniversary of his death in December.
It's part of a public relations campaign to increase interest in a
man whose monumental reputation has made him seem remote and
unknowable. ``Washington eludes us,'' the writer Gary Wills once
put it, ``even in the city named for him.''
</P>
<P>
   So Mount Vernon wants you to meet the real George, a tall,
well-muscled, hot-tempered Virginian who liked to gamble, dance,
ride fast horses and toss back a few at the Masonic hall. ``In many
ways,'' Laughlin says, ``he was a normal guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Except that he wasn't, at least not in the important ways
Americans remember and revere. Washington realized his symbolic
position as the first head of a new republic, and he carried
himself with an appropriate reserve and dignity. No one actually
called him George (at least until JFK Jr.). Even around the house
they addressed him as ``the General,'' or if Martha was in a frisky
mood, she might call him her ``old man.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition fleshes out Washington through 170 artifacts _
paintings, letters, clothing, personal effects _ more than half of
which have never been shown publicly. They illustrate different
sides of a remarkable life:
</P>
<P>
   Soldier. Washington first made his reputation as a military man
fighting with the British during the French and Indian War. We see
the bloody silk sash he was given by his mentor, Gen. Edward
Braddock, as Braddock lay dying after a battle. Washington survived
with four bullet holes in his coat. ``There is something charming
in the sound'' of musket fire, he admitted in a letter.
</P>
<P>
   Man of peace. Washington came to see gunfire less romantically
during the Revolutionary War. After the British were defeated, he
commissioned a copper dove weather vane with an olive branch in its
mouth to crown his mansion overlooking the Potomac River. It was
removed for restoration a few years ago and will be returned to
Mount Vernon after the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Husband. Washington fell hard for a neighbor as a young man, but
she married his best friend. He ended up with the widowed Martha
Custis, whose tiny wedding slippers and blue checked linen bathing
gown are seen. It has weights in the bottom to prevent anyone from
glimpsing her bare legs. Martha might have feared other
indiscretions; she burned all but two of her husband's love letters
to her. The survivors are displayed in rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Icon of freedom. Europeans were fascinated by a man who won a
war and then had to be coaxed from his farm to head the victorious
government. During the French Revolution, Washington's old
lieutenant Lafayette sent him a big iron key to the Bastille, the
Paris prison that became a symbol of the repressive monarchy. The
French also gave Washington a model of the jail carved from one of
its stones. Notice the chipped places; Martha's grandchildren
apparently liked to play with it.
</P>
<P>
   Slaveholder. Washington was the only Founding Father who
actually freed his slaves. Though he and his wife owned more than
300, he grew so disenchanted with the institution of slavery that
he wrote Lafayette, ``I do not like to even think, much less talk
of it.'' In a neatly scripted ledger, Washington accounts for which
slaves are his and which belong to the Custis family. He could free
only the ones he owned, which he did in his will.
</P>
<P>
   Washington was only 67 when he died on Dec. 14, 1799,
suffocating from an acute case of tonsillitis. We see the
blood-stained dressing gown he is thought to have worn during his
final hours, as doctors bled him, bathed his throat in ammonium
carbonate, forced him to vomit, gave him an enema and applied a
poultice of wheat bran to his feet and legs.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of other artifacts: his pistol, his dress
sword, his camp bed from Valley Forge, a deerskin bag of his hair
powder. But none of them humanizes the Father of His Country quite
like his dentures.
</P>
<P>
   Washington started losing his teeth in his 30s, probably, he
told John Adams, because of all the walnuts he cracked in his
youth. He had trouble finding good-fitting false teeth; the
exhibition includes a letter he wrote to a dentist complaining of
dentures that ``bulge my lips out in such a manner as to make them
appear considerably swelled.''
</P>
<P>
   He never owned a set of wooden teeth, as is commonly thought.
They just looked wooden, having yellowed to the tone of varnished
hickory. ``It took us five or six hours to clean them,'' Laughlin
says.
</P>
<P>
   And these are Washington's show teeth _ the ones he used for
greeting guests. He used another set for chewing food.
</P>
<P>
   Washington was a proper man who guarded his privacy, so one can
only imagine what he would think of airing his dirty teeth. But
from Mount Vernon's point of view, the anniversary attention has
proved a tonic. After declining for several years, attendance at
the estate has rebounded in 1999 and is expected to pass 1 million
before Thanksgiving. That's more visitors than Elvis Presley's
Graceland or Thomas Jefferson's Monticello draw.
</P>
<P>
   Dabney Barber of Mineral, Va., was so impressed with Mount
Vernon this summer that she took her two teenage children to the
``Treasures'' exhibition in Richmond to complete their tour of all
things George.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm embarrassed to admit this,'' she said, ``but I talked to
his tomb. I stood there and told him, `We could use a man of your
integrity and character right now.'''
</P>
<P>
   Caleb, her 14-year-old son, didn't go that far, but he agreed
with his mother. ``He was a good guy,'' he said. ``And his teeth
are pretty cool.''
</P>
<P>
   THE STUFF
</P>
<P>
   Washington's famous dentures were made of ivory and animal
teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Custis' silk slippers from her wedding to Washington in
1759.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Washington
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert Stuart painted this oil on canvas portrait about 1798.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert Stuart's famous portrait, which Martha Washington
``hated.''
</P>
<P>
   Martha Washington's brown silk satin gown from the 1790s.
</P>
<P>
   Leather holsters held this flintlock pistol, made by London
craftsmen.
</P>
<P>
   French sculptor Devile is credited with casting this plaster
mask.
</P>
<P>
   A tackle box holds fishing lines, floats and loose hooks.
</P>
<P>
   This key to the Bastille in Paris was sent as a gift by
Lafayette.

<P>
   ATLANTA: for a lot less money,'' Lankford says.
</P>
<P>
   A generation gap?
</P>
<P>
   The politics of living together is infinitely complex, whether
you are a college freshman living with a strange roommate for the
first time _ or a couple in a state of marital bliss. But the
culture clash among the Woodruff administration, patrons and art
students has always particularly obvious, and often comical. That
the tuxedo-and-gown crowd brushes against the tattooed-and-pierced
set is what gives the college so much vitality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time they have an event, they post guards at all the
doors around the whole building and redirect you to the slave
entrance like we are not fit to be seen by the patrons that are
basically supporting the arts center and the school anyway,''
Garcia says. ``We have to be rerouted so no one can see us and then
take the little elevator up. I know it has to do with not
disturbing whatever it is that they are doing and keeping traffic
down, but it feels kind of crummy.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Lankford: ``Our feeling of how they feel about us is that
we are a nuisance. And the beauty of it is that we are constantly
hanging out the windows or yelling or doing something that just is
not for the arts center. `It's just not proper!''' At this last
remark, her voice changes register, as if she is mocking a
schoolmarm scolding her charges.
</P>
<P>
   She continues: ``You feel tension between the High and here.
It's funny because you realize we are what fuels them and they
totally don't appreciate our creativity. No matter how intrusive it
is on their pristine white walls, we are the next generation that's
going to fuel their business. You would think they would be more
interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the board chairman senses conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always feel like the rest of the Woodruff Arts Center looks
at us like we are the art students who might be a little more
avant-garde than the patrons,'' says board chairman Daniel.
</P>
<P>
   This is nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   In a college history published by the Atlanta History Center,
the writer describes the atmosphere in the '50s: ``Adding to its
problems, (the college) made an increasingly odd mix with the
society ladies who ran the museum. They did not like finding
evidence that some down-on-his-
</P>
<P>
   luck student had camped there overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Meyer: ``Sometimes I see it, and it's all so human. All it
takes is one engagement as simple as, `Oh, are you a student here?'
And usually both sides relax and talk.''
</P>
<P>
   When the college does build a new dorm, Meyer and the board are
adamant about keeping it close to the college's teaching space.
Security is a prime concern.
</P>
<P>
   The college teaching space occupies the fourth floor of the
Woodruff building; its administrative offices are on the third
floor, as are the Woodruff's executive offices.
</P>
<P>
   Some faculty members say it might make sense if the Woodruff
moved its offices across the street and let the college use that
space. ``We wouldn't have the secretaries walking down the halls
getting offended,'' says Anderson, the drawing professor.
</P>
<P>
   There's only one problem: How do you move the Woodruff out of
its building?
</P>
<P>
   Paging Mr. Piano.
</P>
<P>
   The serious side of art
</P>
<P>
   But this was supposed to be a story about educating the art
student, and it is. In this temple of learning, there are at least
430 stories to tell.
</P>
<P>
   On a fine fall day, Anderson is telling a senior drawing class
about aspects of beauty, why we are drawn to symmetrical faces.
Marcia Cohen's drawing class is on the floor using sticks to
scratch images of her collection of pods and pine cones and dried
flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Down in the college gallery, senior painting major Scott Foxx is
writing a review of the faculty art show. He's angry that there's
not more new work, that some of it is so blatantly commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs, Anderson is counseling a student whose grandfather has
committed suicide. Back down in the gallery, Foxx is talking about
Anderson's installation in the faculty show. It's a series of
shovels that conjures up images of AIDS, religion and the grave
diggers in ``Hamlet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry says, `There are only three subjects in art: sex, death
and mom,''' says Foxx, with obvious admiration for his mentor.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Anderson if there is a schism between the computer art
disciplines and the fine arts, and he has a quick reply: ``Imagine
if Leonardo had had a computer. He probably wouldn't have
painted.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody has a story, it seems. Meyer likes to talk about the
time the entire college went to see the Picasso show at the High.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 8 o'clock in the morning,'' she says. ``They haven't
opened the elevator to the upper floors and it's incredibly noisy.
One student breaks free and tries to run up the ramp. You know, `To
the art! Get me to the art!' So then there was this amazing thing.
The elevators open, and everybody goes upstairs. Silence. It's like
being in a church. And you are taken aback because they are so
taken aback.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, who is a design major, says he's only been in the museum
once _ on assignment. Then he remembers a lovely story about the
day he learned an important lesson about art. Everybody was
supposed to bring a pepper to professor Tony Greco's drawing class,
but no one remembered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt really stupid because I didn't bring it in either. That
was like the very beginning of my freshmen year when I wasn't quite
adjusted and stuff. He was going down the roll, and he was asking
you if you had a green pepper, and for some reason I was just a
smart ass that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Greco asked Garcia if he had his pepper. ``And I was like: `No.'
Like: `Of course not.''' The professor flipped out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just gave us the most motivational speech I've heard since
I've been here about him being passionate about art. `Sure, it's
just peppers, but it boils down to you being interested in what you
are doing and paying so much money and then not coming equipped.'
He like broke down and his voice cracked, and he got teary-eyed.
And that made me realize with his pepper lecture that this was
serious and that was time to take art seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   The professor dismissed the class and told them to return in an
hour _ with peppers.
</P>
<P>
   This being an urban college, the students just ran across the
street and got some from the pizza place at Colony Square.
</P>

 &HT;    To give or not to give: That is the question _ and moral dilemma
_ people face daily when confronted by panhandlers begging for
change
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Don't forget to show hospitality to strangers, for some who
have done this have entertained angels without realizing it!'' (The
apostle Paul in Hebrews 13:2.)
</P>
<P>
   ALTANTA _ In a busy street corner in downtown Atlanta, a man is
about to become invisible.
</P>
<P>
   His name is Russell Tinsley, a scarecrow-thin man with a Don
King Afro. Tinsley, a 68-year-old panhandler with dirty fingernails
so long they're shaped like claws, wobbles to his sidewalk perch.
Twenty-one pennies rest in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be all right,'' he announces to no one in
particular as he holds out a plastic cup. ``I'm a child of David.''
</P>
<P>
   Tinsley's disappearance isn't caused by magic.
</P>
<P>
   He simply ceases to exist as the lunchtime traffic swirls by him
on Marietta Street. Most people who walk past speed up as they
approach; a few glance over with concern, but do nothing.
</P>
<P>
   This grim street drama is played out hundreds of times each day,
part of urban life in the late 20th century. With every fleeting
encounter, a choice must be made _ to give or not to give?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hard question,'' says Alan Harris, an activist for the
homeless for the past 16 years. ``I still don't have a simple
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Few do. There are an estimated 11,000 homeless people in Atlanta
on any given day. Some are in need. Some are on drugs or mentally
ill. And some are scamming. Each extended cup thrusts a moral
dilemma onto the panhandler's target.
</P>
<P>
   The right response seems simple at first. The Bible, Torah,
Koran and other holy books are filled with exhortations to help
strangers in need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theologically, you should think of people on the streets as
people created in God's image,'' says Andrew Walker, 40, a Georgia
Municipal Association employee who was so vexed by encounters with
beggars that he attended a recent seminar given by Columbia
Theological Seminary on the issue. ``You should be welcoming to
people you don't know because you could be entertaining angels.''
</P>
<P>
   But a seminar can only offer advice. The answers have to be
found on the streets, in that instant when both sides meet.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Schiele is caught in such a moment.
</P>
<P>
   He is part of the crowd that streams by Tinsley on this sunny
afternoon in early fall. He doesn't break stride, doesn't even look
at Tinsley when the man extends his cup.
</P>
<P>
   Schiele is startled when asked why he didn't give. He says he
never gives to panhandlers. He prefers charities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what they're going to do with the money, and what
they're going to spend it on,'' says Schiele, a 29-year-old
employee at the Federal Reserve Bank. ``I don't know if they got a
house and a job and come down here on their day off to panhandle.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people simply improvise. They bounce between compassion and
cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on the day, the moon and whether I have change in
my pocket,'' says Jessie Bitetti-Griffin, Schiele's co-worker and
lunchtime companion.
</P>
<P>
   Bitetti-Griffin, 29, says she was once approached by a desperate
woman who said she needed bus fare to visit her sick daughter. She
gave the fare to the woman. Later that day, she saw the same woman
approach a passer-by with the same story.
</P>
<P>
   When asked, Tinsley insists his needs are legitimate. He pulls a
wrinkled paper from a plastic bag, containing seven prescriptions
from Grady Memorial Hospital for assorted illnesses, including
emphysema.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could work, do you think I'd stay out here and become
subservient for three or four dollars?'' he asks in a raspy voice.
``I got too much pride as a black man to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Tinsley says he nets about $17 a day from begging. He says he
can't work because he's too ill, and he has no family or friends.
He says he sleeps on a bed of cardboard in abandoned houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to get a job again, maybe telemarketing,'' Tinsley
says, adding that he once did that kind of work. ``But first I
gotta get cleaned up. I gotta get shaved, trim my hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris Jolley says he's already found his job. A wheelchair
user, the 36-year-old man is holding a McDonald's cup outside of
Macy's department store on Peachtree Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goodness!'' Jolley shouts to a statuesque woman, swiveling his
wheelchair to get a better view.
</P>
<P>
   Jolley has been panhandling in Atlanta for 11 years. But he
doesn't call it that _ he says he's a tour guide. He flags down
tourists and gives them directions to city landmarks. ``If I help
them,'' Jolley says, ``then I expect a donation.''
</P>
<P>
   He makes up to $100 on a good day, he says, from assorted
donations. ``I live better than some of the folks who work down
here,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   James Hall, 33, approaches Jolley, frowns briefly and walks by
his rattling cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen him for years,'' Hall says. ``This guy might be in a
wheelchair and limited in mobility, but he has the ability to do
telemarketing, work with his hands or get trained to work on a
computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Jolley says he'll lose his medical benefits if he works full
time. He earns enough from his panhandling to rent a $550-a-month
two-bedroom apartment, complete with a television, microwave, CD
player and VCR.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no shame at all,'' he says of his panhandling. ``It
pays my light bill, my gas bill. I get to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Morningstar of the Columbia Theological Seminary thinks
there are several practical ways to handle panhandlers.
</P>
<P>
   Associate director for its Lay Institute of Faith and Life, she
taught a seminar on the subject that included a couple of options.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of money, Morningstar suggests giving panhandlers
coupons to fast-food restaurants, keeping nonperishable food items
in your car for panhandlers on freeway exits, or giving them a 211
card _ a free service operated by United Way that refers people to
agencies for food, clothing, shelter and day care.
</P>
<P>
   But she also gives money _ even though she knows it might be
used to buy drugs or alcohol. It's not her place, she thinks, to
judge others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each one of us is created by God and loved by God,'' says
Morningstar, 49. ``When you pretend that a person is not there and
do not acknowledge their humanity, it's a slam in the face of
God.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to Russell Tinsley, the invisible man.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, he's not having much luck. In two hours, only five
people _ mostly blue-collar types _ have stopped by to give him
change.
</P>
<P>
   The lunch hour crowd is thinning. Tinsley wraps a dirty
imitation-leather jacket closer around his thin body. A young man
in jeans and shades steps out of a pizza shop, looking like a young
Tom Cruise. He pauses and drops 50 cents into Tinsley's cup.
</P>
<P>
   A faint smile spreads across the panhandler's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone like him is obviously down on his luck,'' says Patrick
Venturella, 30, a tourist from New York. ``It's not something I do
all the time. You can be cold and callous but you gotta look at it
from their perspective. I've gone through periods where I've been
broke. You live on five bucks a day in these little minimum wage
jobs. You remember that.''
</P>
<P>
   Venturella shrugs and glances at Tinsley once more. Then he
vanishes into the sidewalk traffic, leaving the panhandler alone at
his sidewalk stoop. The chattering pedestrian traffic surges past
Tinsley's outstretched hand. He fades into the urban landscape,
just another bedraggled beggar, once again invisible.

PENTAGON PREPARES TO EVICT PROTESTERS FROM TARGET RANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon, anticipating that President Clinton
will temporarily reopen a target range on the Puerto Rican island
of Vieques, is developing plans for U.S. marshals to evict
protesters from the site and for U.S. Coast Guard vessels to
intercept any other demonstrators arriving by sea.
</P>
<P>
   The preparations set the stage for a potential confrontation
between federal law enforcement officers and Puerto Rican
demonstrators who have occupied the target range for the last five
months in an effort to prevent the Navy and Marine Corps from using
it.
</P>
<P>
   A four-member Pentagon review panel appointed at the request of
the president has recommended resumption of live-fire combat
training on Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Pentagon official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Friday that Clinton administration officials who report to
Defense Secretary William Cohen and Attorney General Janet Reno are
developing contingency plans to evict demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal will be to protect the safety of protesters in the
live impact area as they are removed from the site,'' the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Licatovich, a spokesman at the headquarters of the U.S.
Marshals Service in Washington, D.C., declined to comment about any
Vieques planning by the marshals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're aware of the situation on Vieques but at this point in
time, we do not have any marching orders,'' Licatovich said. ``We
do not comment on provisional planning for any kind of operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Navy Secretary Richard Danzig has written twice to Puerto Rico
Gov. Pedro Rossello to urge him to help persuade the trespassers to
leave the site on their own accord. Danzig appealed to Puerto Rican
authorities again, in remarks distributed by his office on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If President Clinton orders us to leave, we'll leave,'' Danzig
said. But noting ``increasing talk of civil disobedience,'' Danzig
added: ``I'd like to think that when a national determination is
made about Vieques, people in Puerto Rico also will respect that
determination _ and if it is that we stay, that that will be
respected.''
</P>
<P>
   Danzig initially delivered his remarks Wednesday to a U.S. Naval
Institute conference in Norfolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is nearing a decision on conflicting demands over the
future of the island target range. Puerto Rico's political leaders
and their allies in Congress want the Pentagon to permanently close
the 58-year-old range that has been used to prepare combat forces
since the World War II era.
</P>
<P>
   But the Navy insists that the range stay open so that
Atlantic-based forces can train for possible combat before sailing
on routine missions to the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   The range includes an 899-acre impact area for bombing and
shelling and an adjacent 11,000 acres for maneuvers by ground
troops.
</P>
<P>
   The range has been closed since April when a Marine FA-18 pilot
mistakenly dropped two 500 pound bombs more than a mile off target.
The bombs hit a hilltop observation post on the range, killing a
Puerto Rican security guard working for the Navy and injuring four
other civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The accident took place almost 10 miles from a three-mile wide
swathe of land where 9,300 civilians reside on the island.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had the Pentagon appoint a special review board in June
to recommend solutions to the stalemate between the Navy and Puerto
Rico.
</P>
<P>
   The board reported to Cohen on Sept. 16 that the Navy should be
allowed to temporarily resume live-fire training on a limited basis
for the next five years. At the end of that period, the Navy would
leave the island and turn over its property to Puerto Rican
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also recommended a multi-million dollar economic aid
program for Vieques and a comprehensive health study to look into
the causes of a cancer cluster on Vieques that some citizens blame
on contaminants from the target range.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the stalemate has potential political
repercussions for the prospective New York Senate campaign of First
Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton because the Vieques issue is an
emotional one among Puerto Ricans. Voters born in Puerto Rico make
up about 60 percent of the 2.6 million Hispanics in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello, the Democratic governor of Puerto Rico, has offered to
campaign for Mrs. Clinton in New York and has been vocal in his
opposition to the use of Vieques for target practice. He has vowed
to seek a federal court injunction to block any resumption of
firing there.
</P>
<P>
   Other prominent political leaders such as Rep. Carlos
Romero-Barcelo, D-Puerto Rico, and civil rights leader Jesse
Jackson have vowed to serve as ``human shields'' to thwart the
Navy's use of the target range if the White House approves
resumption of bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rubin, a member of the Vieques-based Committee for the
Rescue and Development of Vieques, said his organization would help
to find substitutes to take the place of any protesters arrested by
law enforcement officers at the series of encampments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are plenty of Vieques volunteers to fill the camps as
soon as they are taken,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers for the Vieques Support Campaign scheduled a rally in
New York City on Saturday at Hunter College and a vigil outside the
gates of the Navy maneuver range on Vieques.

   CHRISTIAN-COALITION (Washington) _ In a striking testament to
the potency of his presidential quest, Gov. George W. Bush glosses
over many issues vital to the Christian Coalition but still draws a
rousing ovation at the group's annual conference here. Unlike his
rivals for the Republican nomination _ and past front-runners who
have addressed the organization of religious conservatives _ Bush
essentially delivers his standard stump speech to the more than
3,000 delegates. His only nod to the group was an appended passage
where he mentioned his championing of a measure in Texas on
parental notification on abortion. By Richard Berke.

   NY-NEWYEAR-VACANCIES (New York) _ Despite all the hype, the
puff, the ``reserve now or you'll be ringing out the twentieth

have been slow. And there is at least the possibility that for
hoteliers, restaurateurs and impresarios, the party to end this or
any other century may turn out to be a bit of a bust. Not a total
bomb, of course. Reservations at hotels and restaurants are still
ahead of where they would be in a normal year, and travel and
tourism honchos express confidence that everything will be entirely
booked by the big day. But New Year's Eve has not, so far, been the
blow-out many expected. By Leslie Eaton.

AS BUSINESS CONFIDENCE GROWS, EURO STAGES A COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ After a nearly nonstop slide against the
dollar for the first six months of its life, the euro is coming
back into vogue.
</P>
<P>
   The euro, the common currency adopted in January by 11 European
nations, jumped 3.6 percent this week. On Friday it reached $1.0767
in European foreign-exchange trading, its highest level in eight
weeks, before settling in New York at $1.0728.
</P>
<P>
   That level is still well below the euro's opening value of
nearly $1.18 at its introduction on Jan. 4, but it represents a big
shift since the currency plunged to just a bit more than a penny
above the dollar in July.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts now believe the euro will continue to climb in the
weeks ahead, even if does not recoup its original value.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate reason for the rise is a growing suspicion that
the European Central Bank, which oversees the euro, might raise
interest rates soon to help cool inflationary pressure. Rising
rates tend to make a currency worth more.
</P>
<P>
   But the broader reason behind the euro's advance is an
unmistakable acceleration of European economic growth and a big
improvement in business confidence over the last month or so.
</P>
<P>
   Growth nearly came to a halt last fall, after the Asian and
Russian financial crises. European exports and industrial
production are now once again climbing.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, Europe's biggest and most beleaguered economy,
business confidence has soared in the last month, in part because
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has veered sharply to the right and is
pushing through big cuts in taxes and spending.
</P>
<P>
   European central bankers have turned much more hawkish in the
last few days, warning that inflationary pressure might be rising
again and that it might well be necessary to cool things down with
an increase in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Noyer, the bank's vice president, warned last Monday
that price pressures had increased and that the bank might have to
react to the inflation risk sooner rather than later. Friday, two
of the bank's top officials issued broad hints in the same
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Wim Duisenberg, the central bank's president, said Europe's
outlook for growth had improved and dangers to price stability
should not be overlooked. Otmar Issing, the bank's chief economist,
warned that price pressures were on the ``upside'' and should not
be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their message has changed over the last four weeks,'' said
Joachim Fels, an economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in London.
``I wouldn't overrule an increase in interest rates at the next
meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   The bank's board of governors is scheduled to meet next
Thursday, and the mere possibility of a rate increase has led
traders to buy up more euros and sell more dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Economists at Deutsche Bank Research, reflecting the view of
many experts, still predict that the bank will probably not raise
rates until next year.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, analysts say there are other reasons for the euro's
second wind.
</P>
<P>
   Economic growth appears to be picking up in both Europe and
Japan, a development that is tending to pull capital out of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the rest of the world looking better, it is now more
difficult to finance it,'' Fels said. ``Capital is looking for
other places to go.''
</P>
<P>
   As growth prospects here and in Japan improve, investors are
also focusing more anxiously on the huge U.S. trade deficit. A
widening U.S. deficit means that a larger supply of dollars is
leaving the country to pay for its imports, which can have a
weakening effect on the currency's value.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more surprising areas of economic expansion in Europe
is France, where the growth rate could reach 3 percent this year
and where the unemployment rate has fallen from more than 12
percent to about 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller euro-zone countries like Finland, Spain, Portugal and
Ireland are all growing rapidly. And though Germany remains
Europe's debilitated economic giant, business confidence has
climbed sharply there in the last month.
</P>
<P>
   Back in April, central bankers were so worried about declining
confidence and even the possibility of a recession that they
reduced the European Central Bank's key interest rate from 3.0
percent to 2.5 percent. But the climate has changed considerably
since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main rationale for the rate cut back in April was that
confidence was very low,'' said Sonja Helleman, a currency analyst
at Banque Paribas in London. ``But that is not the case now.''

NASA SAYS LAUNCH OF CREW MODULE TO BE DELAYED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The already tardy launching of a Russian-built crew module for
the international space station will be delayed from early November
to no sooner than Dec. 26, NASA said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Space agency officials from the two countries agreed to the
change during a series of technical sessions this week in Moscow
and are expected to set a firm date by early November.
</P>
<P>
   The 43-foot-long Zvezda crew module will furnish the living
space and life support equipment for the three-member crews of
astronauts and cosmonauts that are scheduled to take up residence
next spring. Without it, future assembly of the new orbiting
laboratory would be stalled.
</P>
<P>
   The previous target of Nov. 12 for the module's launching from
the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan was already 17 months later
than originally planned. Chronic financial problems in Russia are
to blame.
</P>
<P>
   The latest postponement can be traced to issues in the United
States and Russia, including the electrical wiring problems found
aboard NASA's space shuttles, said Kyle Herring, a spokesman for
the agency's station program.
</P>
<P>
   The latter date will produce favorable lighting conditions in
orbit for the automated docking between the new module and the
unstaffed components of the new station that were launched and
joined in orbit late last year.
</P>
<P>
   The linkup is to take place over Asia, where there is radio
contact between Russian ground stations and all of the orbiting
components.
</P>
<P>
   The area will be too dark between November and early December
for the live television views of the rendezvous and docking
activities from cameras on the new module that are to be beamed to
Earth, Herring said.
</P>
<P>
   During the operation, the new module is to act as a passive
target for the Russian propulsion and U.S. docking modules that
were linked previously.
</P>
<P>
   The delay will also permit Russian engineers to extend the
module's pre-flight software tests that have been under way at
Baikonur for months, Herring said.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is the readiness of the shuttle Atlantis, which
had been slated to follow Zvezda into orbit in early December to
deliver tons of supplies for future station crews.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttle flights, however, were suspended following the late July
launching of the shuttle Columbia. An electrical short that
jeopardized the Columbia launching prompted a lengthy round of
inspections and repairs of the wiring on Discovery, Endeavour and
Atlantis before launchings resumed.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery should be ready to launch before Thanksgiving on a
high-priority mission to replace failing gyroscopes on the Hubble
Space Telescope. Endeavour could be ready for launching in December
with a large radar apparatus to map the Earth's surface.
</P>
<P>
   Wiring work on Atlantis did not begin until late this week, and
it is unlikely to be ready for launching on its station supply
mission until February.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the latest delay of the Russian crew module and the
shuttle wiring problems, station planners had scheduled eight U.S.
and two Russian construction missions for next year.
</P>
<P>
   The accumulation of delays will have a ripple effect, forcing a
succession of delays in those missions to furnish the American
laboratory module, electrical power generators and an airlock,
Herring said.
</P>
<P>
   The station's first resident crew, though, could be launched as
soon as March.

GOP HOPEFULS COURT CONSERVATIVE RELIGIOUS GROUP

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Christian Coalition exercised its clout within
the Republican Party Friday as it flailed Congress, chastised
maverick Pat Buchanan and embraced Texas Gov. George W. Bush and
other candidates seeking the party's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want leaders who are motivated by love of country, not fear
of the next opinion poll,'' Christian Coalition founder Pat
Robertson told 3,500 cheering conservative activists attending the
``Road to Victory'' rally.
</P>
<P>
   All but two of the Republicans seeking their party's
presidential nod were scheduled to appear before the group in the
cavernous Washington Hilton and Towers during the two-day event.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has crafted a centrist message, got loud applause when
he sounded anti-abortion principles that remain at the core of the
Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every child, born and unborn, must be protected by law and
welcomed to life,'' Bush said in a 25-minute speech that touched on
personal responsibility, a stronger national defense, family themes
and the need for local control of education.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also called for a tax cuts and a tax plan that helps those
emerging from poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, he accused the Republican-led Congress of
trying to ``balance their budget on the backs of the poor'' by
deferring tax-credit payments to people with low incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gary Bauer, the former president of the Family
Research Council and a favorite of religious conservatives,
received a standing ovation when he told the crowd: ``I will not
sacrifice one baby for political gain.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer also vowed an administration that would work to overturn
abortion rights, repeal trade pacts with China and block gay rights
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marriage is between a man and a woman, not a man and a man,''
Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Moments before his speech, Bauer's wife, Carol, took the lectern
and tearfully insisted that rumors that her husband had had an
affair with an female aide were unfounded and untrue.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer's campaign accused aides with billionaire publisher Steve
Forbes of spreading the lies and innuendo.
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes campaign adamantly denied being the source of the
rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole, the former Red Cross president, invoked the
image and deeds of former President Ronald Reagan to bolster her
conservative credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to lead with your heart, not with the latest polling
data,'' said Dole, using one of several applause lines that got
only a tepid response here.
</P>
<P>
   Two Republican presidential candidates did not appear before the
rally _ Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Buchanan, who has strongly
hinted he will bolt the GOP and seek the Reform Party presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson issued a warning to Buchanan that conservatives would
not follow him to a party that was founded by billionaire H. Ross
Perot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see him taking many Christian conservatives with him,
not to the Reform Party,'' Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   He also accused Republicans in Congress of doing little to
further the causes of the religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We helped you to be elected. Now we ask for your principled
leadership. We ask for courage,'' Robertson said, adding that ``it
is better to lose fighting a noble cause than to live in peace as a
coward.''
</P>
<P>
   But Robertson saved his most blistering rhetoric for President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we prepare for a new millennium, I want to start with
cleansing the highest offices of the land from the sleaze and the
equivocation and the moral rot, which has embarrassed us all,''
Robertson said.

COURT WEIGHS AID TO RELIGION, FREE SPEECH AND CONGRESS' POWER

 (For release Sunday, Oct. 3)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Should states be allowed to give computers bought
with taxpayers' money to parochial schools? Does a limit on
campaign donations to candidates for state offices
unconstitutionally restrict freedom of expression. Has Congress
gone too far in protecting personal privacy and the rights of
women?
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court takes up these and other hot-button issues
this fall as it wrestles with a wide variety of cases in its
1999-2000 term that starts Monday.
</P>
<P>
   However, the court may have to deal with some cases without
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who underwent surgery for colon cancer
on Sept. 17 and is recuperating at home.
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg did some work during her hospitalization, taking part
by phone or with written comments in the court's review of hundreds
of appeals that had come in over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Although she may miss some oral arguments, court observers
expect her to vote on all the cases before the court. But if she
were to excuse herself from any case, these experts say her absence
would likely have little impact on the court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Vivian Berger, a Columbia University law professor, noting that
Ginsburg is one of the most liberal justices and rarely casts a
swing vote, says that her absence would mean ``that on a close
vote, the court would go 5-3 instead of 5-4.''
</P>
<P>
   The parochial school issue is a recurring problem for the high
court given the First Amendment rule that ``Congress shall make no
law respecting an establishment of religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the justices have agreed to decide whether the state of
Louisiana can continue to use taxpayers' money from a federal bloc
grant to provide computers, software and library books to religious
schools.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the court further relaxed the
separation-of-church-and-state doctrine by allowing public school
teachers to go into religious schools to provide remedial tutoring
for low-income students under a federal aid program. In that case,
the court said there was no violation of church-state separation
because the public school teachers were instructing the poor
students in secular subjects.
</P>
<P>
   In the Louisiana case, the Clinton administration wants the
court to apply that rule to computers and other electronic
equipment. ``We need to be sure all school children learn to use
computers and are connected to the Internet,'' U.S. Solicitor
General Seth Waxman said in a written argument to the court.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of school vouchers, which President Clinton has
opposed, are backing his position in this case because they see it
as a chance for the court to open the door for the use of taxpayer
money for private school tuition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voucher issue is cropping up all over the country, and
this case gives the court an opportunity to give some guidance as
to where the boundary between church and states lies in regard to
schools,'' said Steven Shapiro, legal director of the American
Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   The first big case on the court's docket involves a dispute over
whether a Missouri law capping contributions from individuals to
candidates for statewide office at $1,075 interferes with the
donors' right to free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the case will give the court a chance to reconsider
its 1976 ruling that upheld limits on contributions to federal
campaigns. In that decision, the court said that although political
contributions were protected under the First Amendment's right to
free speech, the government could limit their amount to avoid the
``appearance of corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the system is screwed up in that it favors
incumbents and candidates with a ton of money,'' says Professor
Joel Gora, a campaign finance expert at Brooklyn Law School. He
adds: ``The court could take this opportunity to really change the
laws and make the system a little more fair.''
</P>
<P>
   In another First Amendment case the court will decide whether a
public university can use mandatory student fees to fund
organizations that support political or religious views that some
students believe are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the
University of Wisconsin had violated the free speech rights of
students who objected to their fees being used to fund a campus
women's center that supported abortion rights and an environmental
group that lobbied against mining and supported a presidential bid
by Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering the number of publicly supported groups that hold
strong political or religious views, this case could have a major
impact on how public money is spent,'' says Stephen J. Wermiel, a
law professor at American University in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Another free-speech case involves a Colorado law that places
restrictions on abortion protests. The state law makes it a crime
for a demonstrator near an abortion clinic to approach another
person within eight feet in order to distribute leaflets, display
signs or engage in conversation unless invited to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy and women's rights issues are intertwined with a
question that keeps popping up before the high court: Where does
the power of Congress end and the power of states begin.
</P>
<P>
   Under Chief Justice William Rehnquist, the court has tended to
favor the states. Beginning in 1992, when the justices said
Congress had no constitutional power to make states accept nuclear
waste, they have repeatedly rejected the idea that Congress can
give the federal government authority over states on issues such as
gun-free school zones and gambling on Indian reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Now the court has agreed to decide, in a South Carolina case,
whether Congress exceeded its power when it barred state motor
vehicle agencies from revealing personal information about drivers
who did not consent to the disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   The case stems from an appeal by the Clinton administration of a
ruling last year that declared the Driver's Privacy Protection Act
passed by Congress in 1994 was unconstitutional. The law was
enacted after a stalker in 1989 used data from the California motor
vehicle bureau to track down and murder TV sitcom star Rebecca
Schaeffer.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina, which was considering selling drivers' license
information to businesses that wanted it for commercial use,
challenged the law, and last year the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of
Appeals ruled it unconstitutional. The appeals court said the law
had offended ``our system of dual sovereignty'' by telling the
states what they could and could not do with their drivers'
records.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Supreme Court took a case that it could use to
decide whether Congress overstepped its power when it allowed women
to sue rapists, stalkers and other attackers under the 1994
Violence Against Women Act. The case involves a student at Virginia
Polytechnic Institute in Blacksburg, Va., who went to federal court
rather than a state court to sue two football players who she
claimed had raped her.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the 4th circuit appeals court rejected the
federal violence statute, saying it ``cannot be reconciled with the
principles of limited federal government upon which this nation is
founded.''
</P>
<P>
   Other federalism cases before the court will decide whether
states can impose additional safety regulations on ships and cars
that go beyond federal regulations and whether states can be sued
in federal court under a federal age discrimination law.
</P>
<P>
   The age bias case was brought by public university professors
from Florida and Alabama and could affect millions of employees in
all states, including those who are not teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The court also has agreed to decide whether the Food and Drug
Administration has the power to regulate tobacco products. The case
tests the government's effort to control cigarette makers and
prevent young people from smoking.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the FDA asserted broad authority over tobacco products
and enacted extensive regulations that restricted cigarette sales
and advertising. But the 4th circuit appeals court ruled last year
that the agency had gone too far by asserting power that belongs to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Other important cases before the court this fall include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether states can give grandparents visitation rights. A
Washington state couple, after their son committed suicide, were
denied the right to see their granddaughters by the girls' mother.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether health maintenance organizations and their physicians
can be sued under federal law for policies that give doctors
incentives to keep costs down and potentially influence medical
care;
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether police on patrol in a high-crime neighborhood may stop
a person because he fled when he saw them approaching;
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether the city of Erie, Pa., was within its rights when it
banned nude dancing, which is protected as a form of free speech,
to prevent crime associated with strip clubs, such as prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether Congress had the right in 1996 to require cable
companies to completely scramble the signals from their adult
channels so children could not see them or to offer adult programs
only between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.

ONE GOOD SHOW THAT'S, LIKE, REAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Monday, Oct. 4)

<TEXT>
<P>
   As easy as it is to bash TV, I think you need a certain amount
of it in your life. You come home. You're too tired to read. You
don't want to talk to one more person but you want some noise. So
you look for a good dependable story, something to make you laugh
or cry and whose characters you feel you know even if you never
worked in a hospital or a law office or lived in a town with moose.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally you hit upon a new favorite that moves right into
your personal agenda. You start to speak of it in terms of ``my
show.'' It's why you need to get home on a certain day by a certain
hour, and if anyone dares to put football on in its place you are
aggrieved.
</P>
<P>
   The remote jockeys, those casual TV watchers who can walk in,
sit down, click around until any old thing catches their eye may
not understand this need to connect with one show. They're kind of
promiscuous about their viewing.
</P>
<P>
   But we monogamous types are true to our show and once hooked
will likely stick around as long as it does. When it's finally
canceled, as all shows must be, we mourn and years later will
wonder what ever happened to Murphy and Frank? Cybill's friend
Maryanne? What about the woman who ran the store in ``Northern
Exposure''?
</P>
<P>
   There's always the chance it will happen again, and so, when the
new fall lineup is announced, we start to cruise in a casual but
mildly interested way.
</P>
<P>
   This year's slate didn't look too promising. It looked at first
like the same sad extremes of the human spectrum _ leering
lunkheads who tell barf jokes and serial killers. In between, all
stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   Even the reviewers were talking in cliches. Here's a
``hard-boiled cop show.'' Here's a show with a woman detective who
gets emotionally involved in her cases.
</P>
<P>
   How about a show with a woman lawyer who says, ``I hate men and
I play dirty''?
</P>
<P>
   Here's a befuddled man trying to survive in a houseful of women
with a mother described as ``catty,'' and a mother-in-law who's
``nettlesome.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a year when TV could show its sensibilities are in the
right place, seeing as how it's been under heavy attack for having
shows with too much violence, too much sex and all white faces.
</P>
<P>
   But there were few repentant signs. Here's a new series that
focuses on sex crimes. They could call it the Dismemberment Hour.
And look, it's on at 9 p.m., that golden hour between homework and
bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   TV is like the weather. We take it very personally and talk
about it as if we should have some say over it. But it just
delivers what it feels like. We say we want less blood and gore and
we get psychopath of the week. We say we want diversity and the
characters get another bleach job.
</P>
<P>
   There's a newspaper cartoon with a white Hollywood mogul sitting
by a pool surrounded by white people, and he says, ``I'd put more
blacks in my shows but look around. There just aren't that many in
real life.''
</P>
<P>
   Real life, at least outside Hollywood, is not full of lunkheads,
vicious killers and stereotypes. Real fathers are not buffoons.
Women do not hate men. Mothers-in-law are not nettlesome.
</P>
<P>
   And, by the way, male detectives get pretty emotional about
their cases, too. Fans of ``NYPD Blue'' say that Dennis Franz's
Andy Sipowicz gets so overwrought they fear each week he'll have a
heart attack. And his connection with his late partner, they
contend, was the most convincing love story on TV last year.
</P>
<P>
   There is something new this season, however, that just might
grab on and become a lot of people's ``my show.'' It's intelligent,
romantic and, like, real, and it might make Tuesday at 10 p.m. a
regular date.
</P>
<P>
   It's called ``Once and Again,'' and not only does it have two
guilt-ridden divorced people who are both over 40, which is so real
it hurts, but they have children and ex-spouses who are downright
typical, not overdrawn ogres.
</P>
<P>
   It's sexy in a mature-couple-with-kids-watching way. So far it
has a divorced father character who can talk about being afraid of
being alone, a divorced mother character who likes flirting again
but isn't sure she should take time out from her kids, and a
teen-age daughter character who's conflicted about her looks and
going to a make-out party.
</P>
<P>
   That there was that much worth commenting on after one show,
along with the fact that some of us were wondering where Sela Ward,
the mother character, got her lipstick, is a strong sign of early
addiction.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ In a move that could intensify the conflict in the
northern Caucasus, Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin cut Moscow's
last links with the elected government of the breakaway republic of
Chechnya on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   For eight days, Russian planes have been bombing what it says
are strongholds held by Islamic militants in Chechnya who have
launched armed attacks against Russian territory. Moscow also says
the militants have set off bombs that have killed almost 300 people
in Moscow and other Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
   Putin declared that the only legitimate authority in Chechnya, a
region that eight years ago voted for independence from Russia, was
a parliament that took office on the eve of the defeat of Russian
forces in 1996 in their first, disastrous two-year war against
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Regional experts say the parliamentary leaders, who met Putin on
Friday in Moscow, had not been heard from since 1996 and had no
authority among the Chechnya population. The population, now
totaling less than one million, regard the parliamentary leaders as
puppets of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Although he did not say so directly, Putin effectively withdrew
Moscow's longstanding recognition of President Aslan Maskhadov, who
has repeatedly asked to reopen negotiations with Russian leaders.
As Russia carried out its aerial bombardment, Putin said he would
negotiate with Maskhadov only on the condition that he denounce the
Islamic militants who have set up base camps in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker of the discredited Chechen Parliament, Amin Osmayev,
told reporters Friday that the reinstituted parliament would be
based for now in Moscow and move later to Grozny, the Chechen
capital. ``The timing of our return depends on the situation in the
republic,'' Osmayev said.
</P>
<P>
   Chechnya's official representative here, Mayerbek Vachagayev,
took Putin's action, however, as a declaration of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means war,'' Vachagayev said. ``Until now, we thought there
would be some way to agree with Moscow. But now it is clear there
is none.''
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov had called for talks and asked regional leaders to
mediate. Putin rejected every offer, Vachagayev said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian leadership now intends to set up a puppet government
that it would try to install in the north of Chechnya and use to
rubber stamp a military offensive, just as they tried to do in
1994, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other regional leaders were also stunned by Putin's
announcement, saying it can only make a bad situation worse. ``The
legitimate authority in Chechnya is President Maskhadov, whether
anyone likes it or not,'' President Ruslan Aushev of Ingushetia
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ingushetia borders Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maskhadov is being left no chance,'' Aushev said. ``He is
being driven into a corner. I can't understand what kind of
advisers Mr. Putin has if they advise to take this road.''
</P>
<P>
   Aushev mocked the parliamentary leaders, who he said were
``perfectly aware that they will have no influence, no prestige in
Chechnya.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin made his announcement as Western governments stepped up
warnings to Moscow not to intensify the Chechnya conflict and to
move swiftly toward a political settlement. Until now, the
international community has cautiously supported the campaign
against the militants.
</P>
<P>
   But as bombing continues, the conflict has spread across
borders. More than 80,000 civilians have spilled into neighboring
Ingushetia, creating what a Russian official belatedly conceded
Friday was a serious humanitarian crisis. Federal and U.N. agencies
are scrambling to provide food and shelter for the refugees, mostly
women and children.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Refugees interviewed on Russian television said the bombing had
killed numerous civilians. Chechen authorities have put the
casualties at several hundred. But with Chechnya cut off by a wave
of kidnappings by gangs led by wayward warlords, there has been
scant independent confirmation of the damage or casualty numbers.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 50,000 federal troops are massed along the Chechnya
border. On Thursday, some reports said, columns of troops advanced
several miles into Chechen territory, although the Russian military
has denied that.
</P>
<P>
   Chechnya's representative here, Mayerbek Vachagayev, said the
troops had moved into the areas around Naursky and Shelkovskoy
along the eastern and western borders.
</P>
<P>
   Russian newspapers have reported this week that preparations are
under way for a ground invasion. Some reports said it might start
in days and move across the Chechnya lowlands up to the Terek
River, effectively redrawing the border between Chechnya and the
rest of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters Friday, Defense Minister Igor D. Sergeyev
did not deny that Russian troops would move into Chechnya. But
Sergeyev said the goal would be to establish a ``security zone''
along the border.

   ``Our Father in Heaven''
</P>
<P>
   By John W. Cooper
</P>
<P>
   Baker, $19.99
</P>
<P>
   Using full-bore inclusive language for the God of the Bible is
like using a pocketknife to open a paint can: Not only is it the
wrong tool for the job, but it's all too possible to wind up with a
serious injury.
</P>
<P>
   John W. Cooper doesn't use that figure of speech in ``Our Father
in Heaven,'' but it's a fair summation of his case.
</P>
<P>
   Should we _ can we _ call God ``Mother''? Is the deity beyond
gender? Are the Bible and the Christian tradition sexist? Cooper, a
supporter of women's ordination and a professor at Calvin
Theological Seminary, painstakingly dissects the pros and cons of
inclusive language and argues that although the Bible does use
feminine imagery for God (and therefore believers can also do so in
certain ways), the church cannot adopt the inclusivist agenda and
remain true to Scripture _ which he sees as the central issue in
the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper's study is rather technical and certainly not a light
read. But ``Our Father in Heaven'' approaches this difficult and
touchy topic with great care and considerable subtlety, and it
deserves the attention that it demands.

   ``Mountain High ... Valley Low''
</P>
<P>
   Yolanda Adams
</P>
<P>
   Elektra Records
</P>
<P>
   This is Yolanda Adams' moment, and she's not letting it go to
waste.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, who has become the top contemporary female gospel singer,
took an at least slightly controversial route by recently signing
to a secular label, Elektra (home of the sometimes decidedly carnal
Doors, for instance) after releasing four CDs in 10 years for
smaller labels Tribute and Zomba.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't happen that often, and it wasn't as if Adams needed
Elektra to maintain her career: She long ago became a huge favorite
in the gospel community and frequently shared the stage with gospel
superstar Kirk Franklin.
</P>
<P>
   But Adams clearly wants to build on her success _ and no doubt
would also like the crossover pop/contemporary Christian/R&AMP;B
success that Franklin has enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Mountain High ... Valley Low'' is any indication, she will
have it. A richly varied contemporary gospel CD, ``Mountain'' finds
Adams co-writing five of the CD's 11 tracks, and often working in
tandem with veteran superstar producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis,
who have produced numerous multimillion-selling CDs for Janet
Jackson and other mainstream R&AMP;B stars.
</P>
<P>
   Like Franklin, Fred Hammond and several others, Adams is
striving to give gospel a clean, contemporary R&AMP;B feel. And like
them, she is largely successful. There are definite touches to the
opening ``Time to Change'' (a terrifically catchy number about
personal responsibility) and definite nods to Whitney Houston's
big, sweeping ballad style throughout.
</P>
<P>
   But Adams is not ``going secular.'' These songs are clearly
rooted in religious messages, from following God's will on
``Wherever You Are'' and ``Open My Heart'' to reaching out to help
other people on the moving ``The Things We Do.'' As with previous
Adams CDs, there is a slight overreliance on big ballads, but in
general this is a very good contemporary gospel release.

OUR CRITIC'S NORTHERN EXPOSURE LEAVES HIM GROGGY FROM FILM
OVERLOAD

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Toronto International Film Festival is not the oldest in
North America; that would be the San Francisco International
Festival. Nor is it considered the most prestigious _ that title is
a toss-up between the Sundance and New York festivals. But the
Toronto festival is easily the most comfortable, and it has the
most interesting mix of mainstream and international fare. It has
more than 300 films to choose from, so one would hope that would be
the case. (And you can tell which people are in Toronto to check
out the festival; they stumble through the downtown streets in a
daze, happy but more sleep-deprived than most new parents.)
</P>
<P>
   If you decided during last month's festival that you were
interested in studio pictures with an imminent release, there were
films such as ``Boys Don't Cry,'' the achingly tragic true-life
memoir of Teena Brandon, the young woman who impersonated a boy, or
``Black &AMP; White,'' director James Toback's heated and funny quest
to deal with the race issue in pop culture. And those movies
generated as much conversation as any movies playing at the
festival's 24th installment, proving that even the films that most
might consider mainstream because of their associations with major
studios deserved a look.
</P>
<P>
   Or if you were looking for less-than-mainstream fare, there was
also ``The War Room,'' the troubling directorial debut of actor Tim
Roth, a film that may have provoked the incensed audience response
during a question-and-answer segment held at the end of the movie.
That's saying something, because Canadian audiences tend to wait
politely in movie lines that are so long they bring back memories
of seeing queues in the Soviet Union for bread and toilet tissue.
One of the endearing aspects of Toronto's festival is that the city
takes part in it; the pictures are well attended by residents.
(Keep in mind that Toronto, New York and Los Angeles have the
highest movie-theater attendance in North America.) The lines are
also filled with excited conversation about the movies, with
attendees gleefully trading information. It's stimulating to be
part of a festival whose mandate isn't to serve the rarefied
movie-business crowd. It should be said, though, that the show-biz
component gets bigger and bigger every year.
</P>
<P>
   It's been noted that this year's festival featured films that
deal with sexuality more than any other year in recent memory. But
given the stigma facing adult sexuality in the cinema, the movies
focusing on this subject in Toronto gave the collection of films a
buzz of sophistication lacking in other festivals. Some films, such
as ``Lies,'' which was quickly tagged the Korean ``Last Tango in
Paris'' (part of it even takes place in Paris), featured a graphic
look at the power plays between an older man and a younger woman.
(The subject matter got ``Lies'' banned in its home country, where
it has yet to play.) Even the studio pictures premiering here, such
as ``American Beauty,'' struggled to bring a discussion of sexual
politics to the proceedings. And ``Beauty'' wasn't the only movie
to touch briefly on the baby boomer-chasing-teen-age girl story:
besides ``Lies,'' there was ``Gregory's Two Girls,'' a
disappointing sequel to the fluky 1980 comedy by Scottish director
Bill Forsyth, whose better days seem long behind him. (There is
also an aspect of the theme in Roth's ``War Room,'' although it's
part of the predatory, incestuous relationship in which a father
forces himself on his young daughter.)
</P>
<P>
   Equally potent on the subject was the French film ``Une liaison
pornographique,'' which showed the power of language. The movie is
a series of funny, corrosive interviews with a couple describing
their highly charged affair. Provocative subject matter wasn't
simply limited to films about sex. Kevin Smith's ``Dogma,'' a
revisiting of the Christ story, was the talk of the festival, too.
Harmony Korine's follow-up to ``Gummo'' _ ``Julien Donkey Boy'' _
sent people out scratching their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the films that got good buzz _ such as the crowd-pleaser
``But I'm a Cheerleader'' and the likable
white-guys-sitting-around-chatting movie ``The Big Kahuna'' with
Kevin Spacey and Danny De Vito _ were picked up for U.S.
distribution. But there wasn't the kind of distributor feeding
frenzy that most people expected. The haunting and beautiful
``Ratcatcher,'' a touching Scottish film with waves of magic
realism about a boy growing up in a squalid housing project, was
not bought. It deserves better.
</P>
<P>
   The international thrust of the festival has to be noted, too.
After all, this is the festival where ``Diva'' had its North
American premiere, and where ``Run, Lola, Run'' and Bernardo
Bertolucci's ``Besieged'' were first seen last year. ``Lola'' and
``Besieged'' caused such a stir that this year's festival was said
to be a letdown in comparison. But that kind of talk _ the
you-shoulda-been-here-last-year contingent _ can always be found at
a film festival. (Remember, too, that U.S. films are seen as
international in Toronto.) And anyone who saw the Michael Apted
documentary ``Me &AMP; Isaac Newton,'' a wonderfully entertaining look
at how scientists were inspired to pursue their various
specialties, had to be excited; each person had a beatific
expression as they spoke in vivid terms about their particular, and
peculiar, love of science. (A NASA scientist said seeing ``Flash
Gordon'' serials gave him the bug; he really wanted to be the
scientist who sent men into space.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite its size, Toronto is a festival that acknowledges its
roots. Hometown boy Norman Jewison, the director whose long and
intriguing career includes films as varied as ``In the Heat of the
Night, A Soldier's Story'' and ``Moonstruck,'' received a warm
response to the work-in-progress he chose to show here: ``The
Hurricane,'' his version of the story of boxer Rubin ``Hurricane''
Carter (Denzel Washington), a man railroaded into prison in the
1960s, and of the Canadians who mounted an investigation to get him
released. It was worth attending the festival to watch Carter speak
and move the crowd with his roiling, powerful reminiscences before
the film on his life played. (When some of the show-biz types in
the theater began to grumble during Carter's remarks, Washington
quelled the impatience with quiet authority: ``Take your time,
Rubin.'') There were enough moments like this to make me start
sleeping in to prepare for next year. .MDNM/ (Elvis Mitchell is a

PIANO PERFORMANCE HELPED AMATEUR FINE-TUNE HIS LIFE

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Fort Worth changed Greg Fisher's life.
</P>
<P>
   He's inspired. He's in demand. He's even engaged.
</P>
<P>
   When the Oklahoma pianist came to town to participate in the
International Piano Competition for Outstanding Amateurs in June,
he was only two years removed from a prison stint and four years
removed from the crack cocaine habit that put him there. He worked
part time, installing auto glass at his parents' shop. He saw a
parole officer once a month.
</P>
<P>
   But when Fisher put his fingers to the Steinway keyboard at
11:28 a.m. on June 11, Ed Landreth Auditorium became his oyster.
The audience shouted their enthusiasm for Fisher's 10-minute
performance, and that night, he socialized with the other 89
pianists at Van Cliburn's Fort Worth home.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the evening, Fisher was announced as one of 18
semifinalists.
</P>
<P>
   The semifinals is as far as he got, but it was far enough,
Fisher says. His performance of Liszt's ``Sposalizio'' was ``the
most fulfilling single performance of the competition'' wrote
Boston Globe classical music critic Richard Dyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great experience,'' Fisher says. ``I wouldn't trade
it for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Fort Worth almost immediately after the
competition to take master classes and to compete for the chance to
play with the Fort Worth Chamber Orchestra. He won, and debuted
with the orchestra June 22. Back at the University of Central
Oklahoma in Edmond, where Fisher is pursuing a graduate degree in
piano, he was offered four dates with the school orchestra (the
first was Sept. 28).
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Marlene, says that audience members from the Fort
Worth competition still keep in touch with him. Some have said they
plan to travel to suburban Oklahoma City to hear him play.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher now has a graduate assistantship at UCO, where the
competition ``kind of put me on the map,'' he says. He'll receive
his degree in May and hopes to pursue a doctorate at the University
of Miami, or with his former teacher, Richard Cass, at the
University of Missouri-Kansas City Conservatory. Then again, he'd
love to study for an artist's diploma in Italy under Benedetto
Lupo, the 1989 Cliburn bronze medalist.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Fisher is back working at the glass shop part time
(but doing bookkeeping, not installing glass). His parole officer
released him from his last three years of parole.
</P>
<P>
   If all that weren't enough, Greg Fisher is engaged to be married
_ to another amateur competition contender, no less. Fisher met
Miho Yamada during the master classes that followed the
competition. Yamada, a pediatric cardiologist from Japan, was a
research fellow at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston until
mid-August, when her work visa expired. In November, Fisher will
travel to Japan to ask Yamada's parents for their permission to
marry their daughter. The wedding is scheduled for this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher says he has come away from the experience in Texas with
``lots and lots of pride.'' He attributes much of that to the
response his playing received from the Cliburn's hometown audience.
</P>
<P>
   Says Fisher: ``I can't imagine any pianist not falling in love
with the people of Fort Worth.''

IRAN'S RELIGIOUS LEADER TRIES TO DEFUSE CLASH WITH REFORMIST
PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN F. BURNS  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ Iran's supreme religious leader moved decisively
Friday to head off a fresh confrontation with the country's
reformist president, instructing hard-line Muslim clerics and their
loyalists in the police not to ``take matters into their own
hands'' in a potentially explosive dispute involving university
students.
</P>
<P>
   Ten weeks after student protests touched off the worst rioting
here since the overthrow of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi in 1979,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, a conservative cleric who wields paramount
religious and political power in this nation of 70 million, used a
major sermon to defuse tensions over a satire in a Tehran campus
magazine that hard-liners had denounced as insulting to one of
Islam's most revered saints.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have heard that some people in some quarters have said that
they will take matters into their own hands and will mete out
punishment,'' Khamenei said. ``Never! Never! In an Islamic system,
punishment is the authorities' prerogative. Any such act from any
person is forbidden, and now that I have forbidden it, it is not
only legally barred but religiously forbidden.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally stunning, Khamenei gave effusive backing to President
Mohammed Khatami, his rival in a tense power struggle between
conservative clerics and a reform bloc led by Khatami, a leading
cleric himself, who won a landslide election in 1997 on a promise
to make Islamic rule more democratic.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, most Iranians have seen Khamenei as the main obstacle
to Khatami's efforts to make government accountable, to subordinate
the police and courts to an impartial system of law, and to broaden
freedoms of speech and press.
</P>
<P>
   In wording with a broad resonance among the conservative clergy,
Khamenei said that Khatami ``is pious, he loves the household of
the Prophet Mohammed, and he is working for the rebirth of Islam.''
Among reformers, the reference to the president working for a
renewal of Islam was taken as particularly significant, since it
appeared to be an acceptance, even if only tactical, of Khatami's
insistence that what he wants is a more tolerant Islamic state, not
Western-style secularism in which the Muslim faith is relegated to
the private domain.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In other remarks, Khamenei hinted that his shift of tone, after
months of pronouncements that appeared intended to isolate Khatami,
resulted from concern that a new showdown might not end in a
triumph for the hard-liners, given Khatami's strong popular
support. Even in the senior clergy, the hard-liners have suffered
major defections, including several high-ranking clerics who were
virulent supporters of the event that traumatized Americans 20
years ago _ the Islamic militants' seizure of the U.S. Embassy, and
the holding of U.S. diplomats as hostages for 444 days.
</P>
<P>
   Khamenei said he had met with ``leading officials'' of the
conservative and reform factions within the government in recent
days in an effort to reduce tensions, and claimed that his efforts
had been successful. Failing to find common ground, he implied,
could lead to both sides losing out to more radical elements who
favor sidelining Islam.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country and the revolution need unity,'' he said. ``The
regime's two main forces, both faithful to the revolution, must
reconcile themselves so as to isolate those who do not belong to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Khamenei's remarks were assured of maximum impact by virtue of
their having been delivered at the shrine of Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, the forbidding cleric who imposed a puritanical Islamic
regime on Iran after 1979 that began to moderate only after Khatami
won the presidency, with more than 20 million of the 29 million
votes cast. Khamenei's sermon at Friday prayers, rebroadcast across
Iran, capped 10 days of commemorations marking the 100th
anniversary of the birth of Khomeini, who died in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In his references to the student satirists, Khamenei appeared to
take a leaf out of Khatami's book, saying that it would be wrong to
``defame all students'' because ``two or three, either deliberately
or through ignorance,'' had insulted Islam.
</P>
<P>
   In demanding that the students not be subjected to summary
justice, as many opponents of Islamic rule have been since 1979,
Khamenei described his instruction that they be given a proper
trial as a ``fatwa,'' a religious decree that is considered binding
on all Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   But he coupled this with a demand for a policy change by the
education and culture ministers, Khatami allies who have licensed
reformist newspapers, broadened intellectual freedoms in schools
and colleges, and otherwise worked to soften Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected more from the country's cultural managers,'' he
said. ``I do not want the cultural atmosphere to be such that a
person feels he can offer insults with impunity, even where such
insults occur through carelessness.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I seriously call on the cultural officials to
rethink and revise their policies.''
</P>
<P>
   The mixed signals left Iranians to ponder where the balance of
Khamenei's message lay. Among Khatami supporters, the prevailing
view was Khamenei and his allies saw profound dangers in a new
showdown. In this, the reformers said, there were echoes of 1979,
when the shah decided not to fight for his throne.
</P>
<P>
   Like the shah, they said, the clerics in power now either abhor
the prospect of a bloodbath, or fear that trying to settle the
issue by force could end with the army, police and even the
Revolutionary Guards, the main bulwark of Islamic rule, splintering
between conservatives and reformers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Khamenei's decision to hold out an olive branch
came as a relief to Iranians, who had braced themselves for a new
showdown on Tehran's campuses after the conservatives took up the
issue of the student satire. After quelling the July riots by
busing tens of thousands of supporters into Tehran for a show of
force, Islamic hard-liners went on a broad offensive, holding
secret trials of student leaders, banning a leading reformist
newspaper, and warning of further crackdowns through the speeches
of hard-line conservative clerics.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, they appeared to have found a pretext for a new
crackdown in the publication of a satire in an obscure campus
magazine. The magazine, Wave, was circulated among students at the
Amir Kabir University in Tehran, a scientific college, and took the
form of an imaginary dialogue between a student and the Imam of the
Age, an Islamic saint whose return to usher in a new age of justice
is a major tenet of belief among Iran's Shiite Muslims. In the
dialogue, the student asked the Imam to delay his re-appearance for
a few days to allow the student to complete exams and other pending
chores.
</P>
<P>
   The affair quickly mushroomed, with hard-line newspapers running
banner headlines, conservative students staging protests demanding
that the authors be hanged, and a senior police commander saying he
would personally carry out any sentence imposed by Muslim clerics.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing the risk of a replay of July's events, when police units
joined with Islamic militia gangs in an attack on a student
dormitory, killing at least two students, Khatami stepped in with a
condemnation of the satire as ``insulting'' to Islam, but said the
greater offense was the hard-liners' efforts to turn ``a small wave
into a storm''.
</P>
<P>
   After Khamenei's sermon Friday, the risk of the affair getting
out of hand appeared to have been contained. But there were doubts
as to how long a truce could last, given the countdown to
parliamentary elections in February, when Khatami hopes to win a
majority that would strengthen the reform drive. In recent weeks,
conservative clerics have vowed to use their powers in a powerful
overseer body, the Council of Guardians, to reject any reformist
candidates they deem threatening to Islamic rule.

   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA _ MOSCOW _ The Russian government Friday came
under increasing pressure at home and abroad to avoid a full-scale
war in Chechnya, even as warplanes pressed their assault on the
breakaway republic and ground forces made limited incursions across
the border.In a policy address at Harvard, Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott Friday will urge the Kremlin to show
restraint. So, too, are the Russian media. While Russia's 10-day
air campaign against Chechnya has won approval from the majority of
the public, a ground invasion conjures painful memories of Russia's
disastrous war in the republic from 1994 to 1996. An editorial in a
leading Russian daily said Friday: ``With our poverty, we soon
might face the same thing we faced some time ago _ shame and new
coffins. But the problem now is there is no money even for the
coffins.'' (Holmes, Cox News Service).

   TIBET-AID _ WASHINGTON _ House liberals like John Lewis and

introduce a bill punishing the World Bank for its approval of a
loan to underwrite the resettlement of 60,000 Chinese farmers onto
Tibetan farmland. ``This plan will displace a large number of
indigenous people from their land. I tend to identify with the
Tibetan people because they've been peaceful warriors for their

Israeli, welcomed by a Palestinian and highlighted the nearly
uncontrolled dumping of waste in the West Bank. The barrels were
removed this week. But, it was just the latest incident that
threatened the groundwater supplies for both Israelis and
Palestinians. Now, with peace talks warming up, officials are

   TOBACCO _ PAINT LICK, Ky. _ Baked by a summer-long drought, some
Kentucky tobacco fields will produce half their typical yield. But
the real heat, the farmers say, comes from a $206 billion health
settlement by Big Tobacco. Experts predict cigarette prices will
keep climbing and escalating excise taxes will further diminish
domestic demand. That means Kentucky farmers will need to grow less
tobacco. Their toil has made Kentucky the state most economically
reliant on tobacco and helped generate the country's highest
smoking rate. (Manuel, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

COURT WEIGHS AID TO RELIGION, FREE SPEECH AND CONGRESS' POWER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 3)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Should states be allowed to give computers bought
with taxpayers' money to parochial schools? Does a limit on
campaign donations to candidates for state offices
unconstitutionally restrict freedom of expression. Has Congress
gone too far in protecting personal privacy and the rights of
women?
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court takes up these and other hot-button issues
this fall as it wrestles with a wide variety of cases in its
1999-2000 term that starts Monday.
</P>
<P>
   However, the court may have to deal with some cases without
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who underwent surgery for colon cancer
on Sept. 17 and is recuperating at home.
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg did some work during her hospitalization, taking part
by phone or with written comments in the court's review of hundreds
of appeals that had come in over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Although she may miss some oral arguments, court observers
expect her to vote on all the cases before the court. But if she
were to excuse herself from any case, these experts say her absence
would likely have little impact on the court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Vivian Berger, a Columbia University law professor, noting that
Ginsburg is one of the most liberal justices and rarely casts a
swing vote, says that her absence would mean ``that on a close
vote, the court would go 5-3 instead of 5-4.''
</P>
<P>
   The parochial school issue is a recurring problem for the high
court given the First Amendment rule that ``Congress shall make no
law respecting an establishment of religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the justices have agreed to decide whether the state of
Louisiana can continue to use taxpayers' money from a federal bloc
grant to provide computers, software and library books to religious
schools.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the court further relaxed the
separation-of-church-and-state doctrine by allowing public school
teachers to go into religious schools to provide remedial tutoring
for low-income students under a federal aid program. In that case,
the court said there was no violation of church-state separation
because the public school teachers were instructing the poor
students in secular subjects.
</P>
<P>
   In the Louisiana case, the Clinton administration wants the
court to apply that rule to computers and other electronic
equipment. ``We need to be sure all school children learn to use
computers and are connected to the Internet,'' U.S. Solicitor
General Seth Waxman said in a written argument to the court.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of school vouchers, which President Clinton has
opposed, are backing his position in this case because they see it
as a chance for the court to open the door for the use of taxpayer
money for private school tuition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voucher issue is cropping up all over the country, and
this case gives the court an opportunity to give some guidance as
to where the boundary between church and states lies in regard to
schools,'' said Steven Shapiro, legal director of the American
Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   The first big case on the court's docket involves a dispute over
whether a Missouri law capping contributions from individuals to
candidates for statewide office at $1,075 interferes with the
donors' right to free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the case will give the court a chance to reconsider
its 1976 ruling that upheld limits on contributions to federal
campaigns. In that decision, the court said that although political
contributions were protected under the First Amendment's right to
free speech, the government could limit their amount to avoid the
``appearance of corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the system is screwed up in that it favors
incumbents and candidates with a ton of money,'' says Professor
Joel Gora, a campaign finance expert at Brooklyn Law School. He
adds: ``The court could take this opportunity to really change the
laws and make the system a little more fair.''
</P>
<P>
   In another First Amendment case the court will decide whether a
public university can use mandatory student fees to fund
organizations that support political or religious views that some
students believe are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the
University of Wisconsin had violated the free speech rights of
students who objected to their fees being used to fund a campus
women's center that supported abortion rights and an environmental
group that lobbied against mining and supported a presidential bid
by Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering the number of publicly supported groups that hold
strong political or religious views, this case could have a major
impact on how public money is spent,'' says Stephen J. Wermiel, a
law professor at American University in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Another free-speech case involves a Colorado law that places
restrictions on abortion protests. The state law makes it a crime
for a demonstrator near an abortion clinic to approach another
person within eight feet in order to distribute leaflets, display
signs or engage in conversation unless invited to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy and women's rights issues are intertwined with a
question that keeps popping up before the high court: Where does
the power of Congress end and the power of states begin.
</P>
<P>
   Under Chief Justice William Rehnquist, the court has tended to
favor the states. Beginning in 1992, when the justices said
Congress had no constitutional power to make states accept nuclear
waste, they have repeatedly rejected the idea that Congress can
give the federal government authority over states on issues such as
gun-free school zones and gambling on Indian reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Now the court has agreed to decide, in a South Carolina case,
whether Congress exceeded its power when it barred state motor
vehicle agencies from revealing personal information about drivers
who did not consent to the disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   The case stems from an appeal by the Clinton administration of a
ruling last year that declared the Driver's Privacy Protection Act
passed by Congress in 1994 was unconstitutional. The law was
enacted after a stalker in 1989 used data from the California motor
vehicle bureau to track down and murder TV sitcom star Rebecca
Schaeffer.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina, which was considering selling drivers' license
information to businesses that wanted it for commercial use,
challenged the law, and last year the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of
Appeals ruled it unconstitutional. The appeals court said the law
had offended ``our system of dual sovereignty'' by telling the
states what they could and could not do with their drivers'
records.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Supreme Court took a case that it could use to
decide whether Congress overstepped its power when it allowed women
to sue rapists, stalkers and other attackers under the 1994
Violence Against Women Act. The case involves a student at Virginia
Polytechnic Institute in Blacksburg, Va., who went to federal court
rather than a state court to sue two football players who she
claimed had raped her.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the 4th circuit appeals court rejected the
federal violence statute, saying it ``cannot be reconciled with the
principles of limited federal government upon which this nation is
founded.''

CHILD CARE SCARCE IN TEXAS, SURVEY INDICATES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Quality child care is both scarce and expensive
in Texas, where only 5 percent of working poor families who need
government subsidized care actually receive it, a new survey shows.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Workforce Commission Chairwoman Dianne Rath underscored
the depth of the problem Friday as she released the 1999 Texas
Child Care Portfolio, billed as the first comprehensive survey of
child care data in Texas. The study covers child care conditions in
all 254 of the state's counties.
</P>
<P>
   The survey shows that the average weekly price of child care in
Texas is $83 for infant and toddler care, $73 for preschool care
and $48 for school-age care.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means a single mom working full-time in a minimum wage
job will have to pay on average in Texas 40 percent of her income
for care at a licensed child care center for one child under the
age of 2,'' Rath said.
</P>
<P>
   Such information is critically important to recognize and
understand as the state moves more families from welfare to work,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be sure that we have child care available, but we
also need to be sure there is quality child care available,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Just over half, more than 2 million children in Texas aged 13
and under, are in need of some type of child care, the survey
shows. Yet there are slots available for only 772,000 of them in
regulated day care centers and homes, said Nancy L. Hard, a child
care consultant who served as director of the project.
</P>
<P>
   State officials are especially worried about the potentially
unsafe and unreliable ``patchwork solutions'' of those in
unregulated care, she said, noting some of the children might have
no supervision at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where quality comes in. They're in substandard quality,
they're in very fragile relationships _ maybe two days with a
grandmother, a day with an aunt, a day with a neighbor,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where if it falls part _ if somebody gets sick or a car
breaks down or somebody has a doctor's appointment _ we really do
see the effect on the employer's bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   The study also identified important emerging trends, such as
growth in service sector and industrial jobs with non-traditional
hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``More of the growth in the Texas economy is expected to occur
in industry that will be utilizing swing shifts and receiving
increasing numbers of seven-days-a-week, 24-hour-a-day jobs
available,'' Rath said.
</P>
<P>
   She pointed out that in Dallas County fewer than 16 out of every
100 child care providers offered child care before 6 a.m. or after
6:30 p.m., yet that was better than in other large metropolitan
areas.
</P>
<P>
   In Harris County, which includes most of Houston, only 69
child-care facilities, less than 2 percent of the total, offered
services during non-traditional hours. Weekend care was available
at 238 or 6.5 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   The study also draws attention to the problem of rewarding and
retaining child care workers, who are often lured to other entry
level jobs where wages are higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not able to keep those people in child care,'' Rath
said. ``We're seeing 30 to 40 percent turnovers in the child care
staff, which is very unstable for children in care and also
difficult just from a management perspective.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After the political upheavals of the Gingrich era
and the impeachment saga, Republicans promised a new era in the
House. There might not be as many bold initiatives, they said, but
the trains would run on time.
</P>
<P>
   Better check that watch. Despite months of warnings, Congress
confronted a derailment of sorts as the new fiscal year kicked off
Friday with most of the annual spending bills still unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the way I would want government to work,'' sighed
Rep. Bud Cramer, D-Ala., who sits on the Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are having a hard time crafting the 13 spending
bills because they have seemingly contradictory goals. They propose
tax cuts, but they also want increased defense spending. They
proclaim that the Social Security surplus is off limits, but budget
analysts say they are in danger of breaking their promise. They
talk of spending cuts, but fear being labeled as callous.
</P>
<P>
   Gimmicks are coming in handy. Republicans classified some
routine spending as an ``emergency,'' a designation that allows
them to ignore their own self-imposed budget caps.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, for some programs, congressional leaders have
created what amounts to a 13th month, pushing spending beyond the
12-month fiscal year so they don't have to fully count it.
Democrats have mockingly dubbed this new month ``Spendtember.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a perfect world we wouldn't do that,'' conceded Rep. Dan
Miller, R-Fla., an Appropriations Committee member, about some of
the creative accounting techniques. He described the process as
``frustrating,'' but said competing interests within Congress and
with the Democratic White House forced lawmakers to look for
less-than-perfect solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Strategy
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley is attracting all the buzz for the aggressive
insurgent campaign he has mounted against Vice President Al Gore,
but Gore may have a secret weapon _ the South.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's been very active on what he considers his home turf and
he bolstered that emphasis this week with the move of his campaign
to Nashville, Tenn. Bradley, on the other hand, is concentrating
his efforts in California, Iowa and the Northeast while paying
scant attention to Dixie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen it,'' said Sen. John Breaux, D-La., when asked
if he had noticed evidence of Bradley working the South. ``Bradley
has positioned himself to the left of Gore and I think that is
going to be a problem in the South.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign is calculating that strong early showings up
North will quickly translate into organization and support in later
Southern primaries, when about one-third of the delegates to the
party convention will be chosen. But Gore's staff is confident that
his Southern strength will hold, particularly among black voters
who have been among the Clinton administration's strongest
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Country Caucus
</P>
<P>
   A new congressional caucus that will look out for the interests
of rural America is being organized.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Eva Clayton, D-N.C., who is working with Rep. Jo Ann
Emerson, R-Mo., envisions the aptly named Congressional Rural
Caucus as a way to ``promote economic and social policies'' that
may not always be in sync with the priorities of big cities.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the area of health-care reform, many lawmakers
from rural areas say the problem of access to medical care is just
as important as the more popular talk about patients' rights.
</P>
<P>
   A rural caucus existed in the 1970s and 1980s, but the group
disbanded in 1994 because of new congressional rules and little
money.
</P>
<P>
   Endangered Species?
</P>
<P>
   The rise of Southern Republicans was instrumental to the GOP's
winning control of the House of Representatives and the region is
usually viewed as increasingly safe territory for congressional
Republicans. It is the Democrats who are supposed to be nervous.
</P>
<P>
   But a political handicapping sheet in Washington paints a
different picture. Eight of 14 embattled GOP incumbents listed in a
recent edition of the Rothenberg Political Report hail from the
South while just one of 11 Democrats does.
</P>
<P>
   One possible explanation: GOP gains in the region have resulted
in Republicans' moving into seats serving areas with enough
Democrats to keep the districts competitive. Surviving Democrats,
on the other hand, represent districts with solid Democratic
majorities, making them difficult to knock off.
</P>
<P>
   Among Southern Republicans on the endangered list are Reps. Clay
Shaw of Florida, Richard Baker of Louisiana and Robin Hayes of
North Carolina.

<P>
   Other federalism cases before the court will decide whether
states can impose additional safety regulations on ships and cars
that go beyond federal regulations and whether states can be sued
in federal court under a federal age discrimination law.
</P>
<P>
   The age bias case was brought by public university professors
from Florida and Alabama and could affect millions of employees in
all states, including those who are not teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The court also has agreed to decide whether the Food and Drug
Administration has the power to regulate tobacco products. The case
tests the government's effort to control cigarette makers and
prevent young people from smoking.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the FDA asserted broad authority over tobacco products
and enacted extensive regulations that restricted cigarette sales
and advertising. But the 4th circuit appeals court ruled last year
that the agency had gone too far by asserting power that belongs to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Other important cases before the court this fall include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether states can give grandparents visitation rights. A
Washington state couple, after their son committed suicide, were
denied the right to see their granddaughters by the girls' mother.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether health maintenance organizations and their physicians
can be sued under federal law for policies that give doctors
incentives to keep costs down and potentially influence medical
care;
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether police on patrol in a high-crime neighborhood may stop
a person because he fled when he saw them approaching;
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether the city of Erie, Pa., was within its rights when it
banned nude dancing, which is protected as a form of free speech,
to prevent crime associated with strip clubs, such as prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether Congress had the right in 1996 to require cable
companies to completely scramble the signals from their adult
channels so children could not see them or to offer adult programs
only between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.

   A Ticket to Ride, But Seats Aren't There
</P>
<P>
   When you bought your ticket, the airline said there was space on
the flight. But at the airport check-in counter, the agent tells
you and other ticket holders that the flight is overbooked _ and
somebody is not getting a seat. You and the other wannabes start
eyeing one another like members of the Donner Party on their way
into the pass. Now what?
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., says this surprise should never happen.
In response to his earlier calls for legislation, airlines adopted
voluntary customer service plans. Not satisfied, he introduced an
amendment to a Transportation Department bill, eventually passed by
the House of Representatives; it comes before the Senate this week.
It would guarantee another change: at the time of ticket
reservation, an airline must inform customers who ask if it is
selling seats on a flight that is already overbooked.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of passengers are denied boarding every
year, but a report published quarterly by the Transportation
Department says that nearly all of these are ``voluntary,'' meaning
that they have accepted the promise of a seat on a later flight
plus vouchers for additional free travel, or even cash.
</P>
<P>
   The report lists the number of people denied boarding, and
calculates how many were involuntary, per 10,000 passengers
boarded. For the most recent report, covering January through
March, Continental had the lowest rate, at 0.31 involuntary bumpees
per 10,000, and Delta the highest, at 3.33.
</P>
<P>
   The average of 10 major airlines was 1.44, up from 0.95 for the
corresponding quarter last year. Other airlines with a rate above 1
were United, Southwest, America West and TWA. The report is
available at www.dot.gov/airconsumer/991qovs.htm.

   Charity Flows in Floyd's Wake
</P>
<P>
   From big tobacco companies to private foundations to a
Pennsylvania youngster who taped four quarters together and mailed
them in, Americans have moved quickly to help victims of Hurricane
Floyd in eastern North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   An emergency relief fund set up by Gov. Jim Hunt raised nearly
$5 million in the first week of the fund-raising effort from
individuals and corporations, with thousands of contributions still
not tallied.
</P>
<P>
   And North Carolina foundations acted quickly in approving $2.15
million in allocations. They are expected to contribute at least $4
million. ``In my 20 years of doing this, I've never witnessed the
foundation community come together as they did on this,'' said
David Winslow, a consultant in Winston-Salem who was enlisted as a
volunteer by the governor's office to aid in fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate pledges included $1 million each from Food Lion and
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina; $250,000 from R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco; $100,000 from Cisco Systems, and $50,000 from
Philip Morris, to name a few.

READING, WRITING AND SOCIAL CLIMBING 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Oct. 3) 
(jt) 
 By MONIQUE P. YAZIGI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Edes Gilbert saw it all. For 15 years as the
headmistress of the Spence School, she saw the parents who lobbied
for their 7-year-olds to be assigned to classes with children who
weren't their friends but whose parents were rich and prominent _
in the hopes that the students would become friends and so would
the parents.
</P>
<P>
   She saw the jockeying to volunteer on the ``right'' parent
committees. ``Mothers would be upset because they weren't put on a
committee with someone who would give them that social leg up,''
said Mrs. Gilbert, who retired in 1998 from Spence, the prestigious
Upper East Side girls' school. ``Mothers would throw a hissy fit.''
</P>
<P>
   And she saw how back-to-school night, when parents flood the
school to meet teachers and rub elbows with other parents, often
had the aura of a competitive Park Avenue cocktail party, with some
adults networking furiously to set up play dates for their
daughters with the offspring of prominent parents like Sigourney
Weaver, Michael Bloomberg, Katie Couric and Ronald O. Perelman.
</P>
<P>
   In her decade and a half as headmistress, Mrs. Gilbert saw these
rituals become increasingly common as some parents came to view
Spence and other elite Manhattan private schools as akin to country
clubs and charity committees _ arenas in which to advance
themselves socially. ``You have to say to yourself, `What's wrong
with this picture?''' Mrs. Gilbert said. ``Where does it say that
school is supposed to take care of the social aspirations of the
parents?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Education is not a country club, but parents are treating it
that way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For the large and mostly affluent pool of New York's
private-school parents, the motivation has long been to secure for
their children certain perceived advantages over public schools:
smaller classes, rigorous academic programs, a haven from the chaos
of the larger society. Private education, at $16,000 a year for top
schools, has been seen as a gateway to good colleges and successful
careers. It still is. But increasingly, having a child in a
Manhattan private school, especially a score or so of schools on
the Upper East Side, is also a means of meeting the right people
and having a focus to one's social life _ for the parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old story was that you had to make it into those schools
in order to insure an Ivy League school for your child,'' said Dr.
Pamela Sicher, a child psychiatrist whose patients live mostly on
the Upper East Side. ``The reasons now seem to have more to do with
parents' feeling accepted on the social hierarchy and less to do
with progression toward academic success on the part of the
child.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gilbert, in her year since retiring, completed a study on
reforming the arduous kindergarten admissions process, commissioned
by a group of Manhattan private schools. The schools' kindergarten
applications have risen some 25 percent since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   She said the pressures on very young children could be enormous.
``The children are carrying their parents' social hopes and
dreams,'' she said. ``Getting into the `right' school, so called in
the parents' eyes, means a lot to the parents. The 4-year-old gives
them a social leg up.''
</P>
<P>
   She stressed that this was not true for all parents at Spence,
not even the majority. But for an increasing number who may be new
to the city or to affluence, and who do not have strong ties to
churches, neighborhoods or other institutions, the school becomes
the social focus. ``What they think is that if they are associated
with the right institution, they will meet the right people,'' she
said.

</P>
<P>
   One private-school mother who lives on Fifth Avenue and spends
weekends in Millbrook, N.Y., amid a colony of fox-hunting types,
said she was the target of parents who, she suspects, seek social
advantage. At school-related parties, ``certain people make a
beeline right for you,'' she said, adding: ``It's very obvious. One
lady who we know wanted to get to know the Millbrook crowd kept
asking me for play dates with my daughter, and my daughter is not
friends with her daughter. I know why she was asking. It's
obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Hausman, an author of ``The Manhattan Family Guide to
Private Schools'' (Soho Press, 1999), said: ``That's typical.
Social climbing through your children _ there's a lot of it. It's
high-class schmoozing.''
</P>
<P>
   Her co-author, Victoria Goldman, pointed out that the presence
of a famous or prominent person's child often swells the number of
applicants at a school. ``After Caroline Kennedy sent her kids to
nursery school at All Souls, it became the No. 1,'' she said.
``Why?''
</P>
<P>
   In their guide, the only one of its kind, Ms. Goldman and Ms.
Hausman generalize about the parental dress style, professions and
school-related activities like cocktail parties at many schools,
details meant to evoke the parental social life typical of each
school. Some schools have more of a social component, they note,
while others have little. Of the Chapin School on East End Avenue,
one of the city's seven private girls' schools, they write:
``Chapin is also social in the traditional sense. `You would never
dress informally for a school event,' we were told, although we
noted that khakis and hair clips have replaced suits and headbands
at drop-off and pickup.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Spence, on East 92d Street, they said one parent told them,
``Ascension through the ranks of Spence's Parent Association
requires a certain amount of social skill and savvy.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the Calhoun School on West 74th Street: ``Socially, Calhoun
is low-key. The primary focus is always on the child, not the
parent or social scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at many schools acknowledge that social climbing takes
place among parents but say they try to discourage it. Elizabeth
Manley Murray, the director of admissions at the Brearley School on
East 83d Street, one of the city's most sought-after, said
prospective parents regularly try to learn the names of the other
children in the grades their daughters are applying to. ``Parents
don't come out and ask me who else will be in their daughter's
class, but they ask other people, and I find out,'' she said. ``We
discourage it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Bosworth, the headmaster of St. Ann's School in Brooklyn
Heights, where there are 10 applicants for each place, said: ``Do I
have a repellent magnet that repels the social climbers? No. What I
do is make it somewhat awkward to be in this community because I do
not allow them to participate in the school as they do with many
private schools.'' There are very few parent-run fairs, he said,
and very few fund-raising auctions.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Bass, the editor and publisher of Private School Insider,
an independent newsletter, said: ``There are tremendous social
expectations of parents. It's no longer who has the second house
but who has the third house and how many cars you have and what
fabulous vacation you're taking. These are the children you should
be hobnobbing with and also the parents. There are many parents who
think it's good for their businesses. There is a group who want to
social-climb through their kids.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``The schools don't necessarily want that,'' but
``the parent body'' does.
</P>
<P>
   Still, are there ways that schools foster social maneuvering
among parents, and an aura that connections count in life? One is
suggested by the surprisingly widespread conviction among parents
that getting a child into some schools is like joining a club.
Maeve Heath, a marketing consultant, decided to put her daughters
into the Marymount School, where 65 percent of the students are
Roman Catholic and religion is part of the curriculum, after
visiting other girls' schools she deemed too social. ``I picked
Marymount because when I went to Nightingale-Bamford, I sat on the
bench with the other mothers who were applying with their
daughters, and it was a bunch of people who just all knew each
other, either from East Hampton or private schools,'' she said.
``They said, `Muffy,' `Buffy.' `It's just like old home week.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have any connections, and I knew we wouldn't get
in,'' she added. ``I knew you had to know someone to get in.''
</P>
<P>
   Her assertion was denied by Carole J. Everett, the director of
admissions for the Nightingale-Bamford School, on East 92d Street,
where according to ``The Manhattan Family Guide to Private
Schools,'' ``the parent body is diverse and varies from class to
class.'' Twenty-two percent of students are members of minority
groups. Ms. Everett, in an interview in her office, pointed to a
couch and said, ``People sit there and say, `I know so-and-so,' and
`We are good friends with the parents of so-and-so.' And that is
supposed to make them a good fit for our school?'' It has no
bearing, she said. Still, many parents, making inferences from the
notoriously opaque process in which their 4-year-olds are tested,
interviewed and observed at play when applying to kindergarten,
insist that it does matter whom they know. ``You hear about this
kindergarten thing, and you never really believe it until you go
through it,'' said one father, a magazine editor, whose son is now
a first-grader at an all-boys school. ``You hear that it is all
about connections. Then you apply, you write essays, you go in,
they look at you. Then you bring your son, and they look at him.
Then you go in again. And then you all go in. And you know what? At
the end, it's all about who you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether parents' social circles have anything to do with
who is admitted to kindergarten, Ms. Gilbert, the retired
headmistress, said: ``Without a question.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one of the subtle ways we limit who applies,'' she
continued, adding that her report is aimed at making kindergarten
admissions more fair and open.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Buckley School on East 73d Street the other day, a
lawyer in a navy blazer stopped to chat after picking up an
application for next year's kindergarten class. Buckley, the
all-boys school where students address male teachers as ``sir,'' is
one of the city's most traditional. ``My partners' sons all went
here,'' said the man who would not to give his name or the name of
his firm. ``So will my son.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Walsh, Buckley's headmaster, said: ``Admissions are not
dependent on social aspirations or social contacts. We do not even
ask for letters of reference.''
</P>
<P>
   Educators and other experts say that children pay a price when
parents make them, even unwittingly, into agents of their social
aspirations. The impact can be general, manifested as anxiety
brought on by parental pressure. Or it can be quite specific, as
when children reflect their parents' hyper-awareness of status
symbols.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children are absorbing an enormous amount of anxiety with
parents who are concerned if they don't get a certain place,'' said
Dr. Sicher, the psychotherapist.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gilbert said: ``The girls are given power they shouldn't
have. They are supposed to get good grades so they can go to
Princeton _ and then you are responsible for your parents' social
life? It's too much power for the child.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Sarasohn, whose daughter graduated from Spence in May,
marveled at how young her daughter's classmates were when many
began parroting parental notions about the ``right'' addresses and
vacation spots. ``They all know the good buildings,'' said Ms.
Sarasohn, a real estate broker. ``It went from kindergarten, where
they might think an apartment was great because there were a lot of
stuffed animals, to seventh grade, when they would describe who
lived in what building _ East Side, West Side.''
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter, Jamie Beilin, recalled how the mother of a
classmate who lived on the West Side used the Spence directory,
with its listing of student addresses, to select her daughter's
playmates from across Central Park. ``It started with the play
dates in the very first months of school,'' said Ms. Beilin, now a
freshman at Cornell. ``Then the birthday parties.'' Only girls from
Park Avenue and Fifth Avenue were invited.
</P>
<P>
   This attitude was once unusual at Spence, Ms. Sarasohn said, but
is now more common. ``There was always one parent who might be
orchestrating play dates for the wrong reasons, but that was the
exception,'' she said. Today, ``there's a mentality of who you
know, who you should get to know,'' she continued, adding: ``The
parents will comment on who else is in the child's class, who's
famous and social. The kids learn directly from the parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sarasohn's daughter seems to be no exception. From her dorm
room last week, she expounded on one topic her 13 years of private
school on the Upper East Side had taught her: the difference
between a Range Rover and its cheaper-by-half cousin, the Land
Rover Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Land Rover looks like you want to have a Range Rover but
can't afford it, and it hurts you,'' she said. ``It looks like
you're trying, and the whole point is to look like you're not
trying, but you know. That's the style of the school.''

INDONESIA'S ASSEMBLY SEEKS TO SPEED UP SELECTION OF PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By WAYNE ARNOLD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ The new national Assembly convened Friday,
and in an irreverent demonstration of the first precarious steps
toward popular government, members booed when President B.J.
Habibie arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The assembly also decided that the presidential selection should
be conducted this month instead of in November, as originally
planned, although two contending procedural proposals emerged.
</P>
<P>
   The 700-member People's Consultative Assembly includes the
500-member Parliament elected in June and 200 appointees. Once a
rubber-stamp body whose primary function was to re-elect President
Suharto every five years, the assembly's first task is to elect a
president from a field that includes Habibie and Megawati
Sukarnoputri, the widely revered daughter of Indonesia's the first
president, Sukarno.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now want the government to be formed quickly,'' said Ms.
Megawati, whose Indonesian Democratic Party Struggle won the
largest share of the vote in June, 34 percent. The party has
proposed a plan that would choose a president by the middle of the
month. The second plan would select a president by the end of the
month.
</P>
<P>
   The assembly is also expected to ratify the results of an August
referendum that the United Nations sponsored in East Timor in which
80 percent of the voters chose independence.
</P>
<P>
   The assembly delegates are highly unlikely to court further
international condemnation by withholding approval, despite
widespread public anger over Habibie's decision to allow the
referendum and subsequently to let foreign troops operate there.
</P>
<P>
   Many politicians and other Indonesians also hope that the
assembly will rewrite the constitution to make the president more
accountable to Parliament, protect human rights and reduce the role
of the military in politics. The present constitution guarantees
the military's place in politics. The new assembly reserves 38
seats for the military's representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Looming over the presidential vote is the question of whether
the results will mollify the public's demand for political reform
and stave off further unrest. Habibie, whose administration has
been rocked by a corruption scandal, the East Timor crisis and
accusations that it has failed to press an investigation into the
finances of Suharto, has rejected demands that he drop his
candidacy.

   EUROPE
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE: BEEF BAN STANDS
</P>
<P>
   The Food Safety Agency recommended that the government maintain
its embargo on imports of British beef because of continuing risks
of mad-cow disease. European Union officials, who ruled that the
three-year old ban be lifted, said they might take legal action if
Paris persists in its ban. France's action has infuriated British
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   BRETONS HELD
</P>
<P>
   The French police have detained two Breton nationalists
suspected of having helped Basque separatists steal eight tons of
dynamite in western France. After recovering part of the stolen
explosives near the Spanish border and arresting three Basques, the
police said, they had found a second lot in an abandoned truck in
Brittany.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN: TORIES PICK ARCHER FOR MAYOR
</P>
<P>
   The millionaire novelist and member of the House of Lords,
Jeffrey Archer, 59, won in a postal ballot of party members as the
Conservative candidate to be London's first elected mayor. His
Labor opponent in the May vote 4 is still to be chosen from a field
that includes the former actress Glenda Jackson, who is now a
member of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   IRELAND: 6 ARRESTED
</P>
<P>
   Six hardline republicans were arrested for questioning in two
counties south of Dublin amid reports from the police in Ireland
and Northern Ireland that dissident guerrillas were planning acts
of violence in the North to disrupt peace talks. The renegades
oppose the cease-fire adopted by the Irish Republican Army two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   VATICAN: 3 NEW PATRON SAINTS
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II announced three new patron saints for Europe:
two 14th-century nuns and Edith Stein, a Jewish philosopher who
became a nun and was killed at Auschwitz in 1944. Until now, Europe
had only male patron saints. The pope explained that he picked them
``to underline the great role women have played in the civil and
ecclesiastic history of the Continent.''

<P>
   COLOMBIA: LEGISLATOR AN EXILE
</P>
<P>
   Citing repeated death threats, a prominent Liberal Party
legislator has announced she is going into exile. In a statement
issued from Spain, Piedad Cordoba said that the government ``does
not have the will to end a war in which human rights violations are
the order of the day.'' More than a dozen rights activists have
been killed since 1997. Senator Cordoba was kidnapped in May and
held for two weeks by a right-wing group.

</P>
<P>
   NORTH KOREA: NUCLEAR ACCUSATIONS
</P>
<P>
   The International Atomic Energy Agency said in Vienna that North
Korea is refusing to upgrade safety at its nuclear installations,
as required by treaty, and is generally not cooperating with the
agency. The agency said 12 rounds of talks with the North Koreans
had produced ``no progress on important issues.''
</P>
<P>
   INDIA: HINDU ALLIANCE FADING
</P>
<P>
   A poll conducted for The Times of India predicted that the
alliance led by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party would
win only a narrow majority in the national elections, which largely
conclude on Sunday, not the sweeping victory that one large exit
poll had forecast. A total of 23,098 people were questioned, with a
margin of sampling error of 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   PAKISTAN: 8 SLAIN IN MOSQUE
</P>
<P>
   Gunmen attacked a Shiite mosque in Karachi and killed eight
worshipers. Pakistan has a history of sectarian violence between
its Shiite minority and the Sunni Muslim majority.
</P>
<P>
   KAZAKHSTAN: PREMIER QUITS
</P>
<P>
   After months of rumors that he was about to be fired, Prime
Minister Nurlan Balgimbayev resigned, saying it was time for a new
government to try to tackle the republic's economic crisis.
Kazakstan's autocratic president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, appointed
Foreign Minister Kasymzhomart Tokayev as acting prime minister.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS: AMERICAN GUILTY OF THEFT
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in recent years, an American has been found
guilty of defrauding the United Nations. A Manhattan jury found
Charles Kim, of Great Neck, N.Y., guilty of stealing $800,000 from
the organization through false travel claims for staff in the
Balkans. From 1995 to 1998, he was chief of travel and traffic for
the United Nations, based in Zagreb, Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   GULF WAR PAYOUTS
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations gulf war reparations body announced it had
approved payments of $234 million to companies that suffered losses
in Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The body said $190 million would
be paid to Kuwaiti firms. The rest was shared among companies from
China, India, Japan, Britain and the United States. The payout will
bring to $3.6 billion the payouts to individuals, companies and
governments that were able to document losses.

   MOROCCO: EXILE RETURNS
</P>
<P>
   A Marxist leader from Morocco, Abraham Serfaty, has been allowed
to return home after eight years of exile in France. Serfaty had
written to the new king, Mohammed VI, asking to be allowed to
return, according to a palace spokesman. Serfaty was expelled by
the king's father, who died in July.

HELEN HUNT INSPIRED ROBERT B. PARKER'S FIRST FEMALE PRIVATE EYE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After devoting years to his revered Spenser series, Robert B.
Parker has landed a book with his first female protagonist on the
bestseller lists. And he has Helen Hunt to thank for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weird, huh?'' the 67-year-old Parker says, chuckling, during a
phone interview. ``But, what the hell. It's the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   While in Los Angeles to attend the 1998 Oscars ceremony, Parker
says, he was told that the Academy Award-winning actress wanted to
meet with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turned out she was a fan of the Spenser books,'' Parker says,
``She asked me to write a book with a female character she could
play in the movie version. We talked at length. The deal we made
was, her (production) company would buy the novel even if, after I
wrote it, they didn't like it. I said to her, `This is my novel;
I'm interested in your views, but I might not pay attention to your
suggestions.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen months later, ``Family Honor'' is a bestseller, and
Hunt loves the book. It's all about Boston-based private eye Sunny
Randall, who has split up with a Mafia-connected husband and is hot
on the trail of the missing teen-age daughter of a slimy
banker/politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw in some Helen Hunt things,'' Parker says. ``For
instance, I learned she loves to paint, so Sunny Randall likes to
paint, too. I like this new character, though Spenser will stay my
main focus. We'll see about Sunny. If `Family Honor' keeps selling
well, she may be back.''
</P>
<P>
   While ``Family Honor'' is still fresh on bookstore shelves,
Parker is already working on Spenser's next adventure. He says it
takes ``four to five months for me to write a book, and that means
seven to eight months a year to do something else if I want, except
I don't. I like to write. I have no desire to travel to far places,
sit on the beach and look at sunsets. I don't fish or hunt. I just
go to the gym and lift weights, and then I come home and write _
five pages a day, five days a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Creating his first female heroine was an interesting challenge
for Parker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I don't entirely understand a woman's point of
view,'' he admits. ``But I've been married to a very smart woman
for 43 years, and she was very helpful with her input. The hard
part for me wasn't how a woman puts on makeup, but, say, what does
a woman think when she's looking at a guy, their sexual take on the
world, all of that.''
</P>
<P>
   With his continued high ranking among modern crime novelists
assured, Parker doesn't mind admitting that he trusts his own
judgment as a reader as well as a writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just write books I want to read,'' Parker says. ``I don't
think about anything else when I'm doing a book, really. Not is
this a hot market topic, not is this politically correct. I'm not
one of those authors who thinks, `Hey, I'm the character I'm
writing about.' Spenser is fiction. And I'm not a writer who thinks
I'm on a higher mission than entertaining people with my books. I'm
not a crime fighter using a pen.''
</P>
<P>
   So whether it's Sunny Parker or Spenser, Parker's protagonists
will continue to be quick with quips and fists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been writing these books now for 25 years,'' he
concludes. ``I hope I'm getting better as a writer, and I'm
inclined to think most of the later books are better than the
earlier ones. But I'm going to keep writing a day at a time, a book
at a time, and if Helen Hunt asks for another one, I'm probably
going to give it to her.''

IS REEBOK STILL REELING OR POISED TO REBOUND?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 3)

graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by
calling (888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)  
 (af)  
 By MICHELLE LEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the great sneaker face-off, Nike Inc. has cleaned the floor
with the competition. It had 34 percent of the $13.8 billion United
States athletic shoe market last year, nearly three times that of
its long-suffering rival, Reebok International, with 13 percent.
And Nike's market capitalization, at $16.25 billion, is about 28
times Reebok's.
</P>
<P>
   So why are some investors still betting on Reebok these days?
It's an interesting question.
</P>
<P>
   The past few years have been miserable for Reebok, largely
because the company was ill-prepared to cope with a consumer shift
from sneakers toward hiking shoes. Managers came and went. Adding
to the company's woes _ and not helping Nike, either _ was negative
publicity about use of child labor in the apparel industry.
Reebok's stock fell 31 percent in 1997 and 48 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But the past four months have been particularly rough. The
stock, which had shown signs of bouncing back earlier this year as
investors warmed to a restructuring plan, has lost more than half
of its value since hitting a high of $22.75 on May 24. Last Friday,
Reebok hit a 52-week low of $10.25.
</P>
<P>
   The main cause of the recent decline was a disappointing second
quarter. Analysts had forecast that Reebok would report earnings of
12 cents a share. Instead, it posted earnings of 8 cents a share on
sales of $697.4 million, down from 11 cents a share on sales of
$760.6 million in the second quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some value investors say there is reason for Reebok to
rebound. In that camp is Robert Rodriguez, chief investment officer
for First Pacific Advisors in Los Angeles, which owns about 6
percent of Reebok's shares.
</P>
<P>
   Though Rodriguez calls the stock ``one of my most unsuccessful
investments,'' he says Reebok's stable of brand names, including
Rockport and Ralph Lauren footwear, still resonate with shoppers.
The Ralph Lauren line _ though small _ was a bright spot in the
second quarter, with sales up 42 percent, to $23.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Maramarco, manager of the Babson Value fund, which also
owns Reebok shares, likewise says the company has potential at its
current price. ``Sooner or later, people are going to come along
and pick this stock out of the gutter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maramarco and Rodriguez say they are bullish on some of the
changes being made by Carl J. Yankowski, a former Sony executive
who was hired last September as chief executive of Reebok
Unlimited, the sneaker division. Yankowski has put more focus on
women's and children's lines _ two areas in which Reebok has
traditionally done well.
</P>
<P>
   New senior managers have been hired and _ in contrast to Nike _
the company decided to place less emphasis on sports celebrities in
marketing. Debt and expenses were reduced, and last month, Reebok
announced plans to cut its payroll by 600 people after laying off
500 in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But several analysts say the changes have not exactly been
sweeping. ``It's hard for me to say that there's anything dramatic
going on,'' said Leslie McCall, an analyst at Brown Brothers
Harriman, where she has a neutral rating on Reebok.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCall has short- and long-term buy ratings on Nike and says
the stock, which closed at $57.5625 on Friday, will hit $70 within
12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Even Rodriguez says Nike is the better company. But he says
Reebok, with a 1999 price-to-earnings ratio of 10.7 and a
price-to-sales ratio of just 0.2, versus 27.9 and 1.83,
respectively, for Nike, remains the better value. ``At the current
share price, it discounts a lot of Reebok's problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks Reebok's enterprise value _ what it would be worth to
an acquirer buying the entire company _ at $900 million to $950
million. The current stock price puts the company's value at $575.1
million.

EVEN IF FED IS IDLE, RATES ARE ON THE RISE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 3) 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To the relief of many investors, members of the
Federal Reserve Board have made clear that they will not be voting
to raise interest rates at their meeting next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   So why are yields on U.S. Treasuries rising? The yield on the
30-year Treasury bond jumped to 6.13 percent on Friday, from 5.97
percent a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious reason for the move was renewed inflation fears
brought about by rising oil and gold prices. Adding to the anxiety
was news on Friday that an index of prices paid by factories rose
to its highest level in more than four years and that manufacturing
grew faster in September than analysts had expected.
</P>
<P>
   But investors who remain certain that bond yields will retreat
again should take note. A pattern of unrelenting selling sweeping
through the Treasury market in recent weeks is not caused by bad
economic news alone.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those doing the selling may be foreign investors who see
the decline of the dollar hammering their returns. But Charles
Peabody, bank analyst at Mitchell Securities in New York, says the
bond market's behavior also reflects a broad unwinding of bets
placed by investors who were later caught unware by recent
interest-rate increases. Many of these positions are now going bad;
as they are unwound, they push rates higher.
</P>
<P>
   First was the so-called yen carry trade, in which investors
borrowed funds in Japan at microscopic interest rates and bought
Treasuries with the proceeds. When the yen spiked up, profits
turned to losses and the Treasuries had to be dumped.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's disastrous trade was a variation on this theme _ the
gold carry trade _ in which investors bet that the price of gold
will drop. They borrowed gold from a bank, sold the gold and bought
Treasuries, making perhaps 4 percent on the difference between what
they paid to borrow the gold and what they earned on the
securities. With gold prices running up this week, those trades had
to be unwound.
</P>
<P>
   The gold carry trade is nowhere near as big as outright bets
made on rates, known as interest-rate swaps, in which one investor
agrees with another to exchange a fixed rate for a floating rate.
</P>
<P>
   Interest-rate swaps account for more than 80 percent of
derivatives held at American banks. In the second quarter, the
notional value of interest-rate related derivatives at domestic
banks stood at $25.7 trillion, up 28 percent from the corresponding
period in 1998. As rates climb higher, these holdings become
worrisome.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Peabody believes that we are starting to see
the ill effects of rising rates on the nation's financial
institutions. ``Because of the positive reinforcement of declining
rates over the last two decades,'' he said, ``most financial
players have increasingly used that trend as a way of boosting
their profits.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the reverse is happening. In recent weeks, three small
banks _ Keystone Financial Inc., the Regions Financial Corp. and
Flagstar Bancorp _ have warned of earnings shortfalls owing to
higher rates.
</P>
<P>
   Will rates rise further? ``Any time you get a trend reversal in
the discount rate, that trend remains in force on average for 14
months,'' Peabody said. ``August represents the first month of a
trend reversal.'' &QL;

TEXAS STUDENT TO RECEIVE NATION'S HIGHEST HONOR FOR YOUTH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALLAN TURNER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ No doubt about it, the challenge facing high school
student David DeFilippo was daunting.
</P>
<P>
   First he dedicated hundreds of hours to community service, then,
dictionary in hand, he haltingly navigated the pages of two
Spanish-language novels. Somewhere along the way, he scaled a
12,000-foot mountain.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, all of his effort will pay off. DeFilippo, 18, a
senior at Strake Jesuit College Preparatory, will become the 22nd
Texan in 20 years to receive the prestigious Congressional Award.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, will present the Silver Award during
ceremonies at Houston Community College's Central Campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to mention that David did not win this
award,'' Archer said. ``He earned it. Congressional Award
recipients represent the best America has to offer, and this young
man is a shining example.
</P>
<P>
   ``... We hear so much about what young people are doing wrong.
But we know that there are also so many young people who are doing
good things.''
</P>
<P>
   The award _ the nation's highest honor for youth _ is open to
contenders ages 14-23. To earn the gold, silver or bronze awards,
they must set and meet goals in four areas: volunteer public
service, personal development, physical fitness and
expedition/exploration.
</P>
<P>
   Seven thousand people have received the award since it was
created in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, the expedition was what really interested me,''
DeFilippo said Friday. ``But as I set my goals and began getting
involved, I recognized that the whole thing attracted me. It was a
way to get myself going in the right direction, a way to get
focused.''
</P>
<P>
   DeFilippo began working toward the goals two years ago after his
mother, Marilyn DeFilippo, a reading teacher at Northbrook Middle
School, stumbled onto an article about the program in a magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``She actually got the whole thing going,'' he said. ``She
showed it to me and said it might be neat.''
</P>
<P>
   To meet community service requirements, DeFilippo spent 200
hours, first as a volunteer at a Houston hospital then, during the
past two summers, as a counselor at a camp for young muscular
dystrophy patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was assigned to one kid with MD, Dwayne Campbell from
Houston, and I'd help him do whatever he couldn't do,'' DeFilippo
said, referring to multiple dystrophy. ``We'd do horseback riding
and canoeing. Mainly, we'd hang out. He was pretty fun to talk
to.''
</P>
<P>
   For the award's physical fitness section, DeFilippo, who had
played basketball and soccer in high school, devised a strenuous
regimen of daily workouts. For the expedition, he accompanied his
older brother Anthony DeFilippo, 21, and a friend on a three-day
outing near Ruidoso, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   In three grueling sunrise-to-sunset treks, the trio hiked about
25 miles. On the second day, they scaled Sierra Blanca. ``It was
pretty rugged,'' DeFilippo said. ``There were a lot of loose rocks
and the wind was going extremely fast. I have pictures of my
brother and I just leaning over into the wind.''
</P>
<P>
   For the academic section, DeFilippo twice made Jesuit's honor
roll, and, though a struggling Spanish student, he read Spanish
translations of two novels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd read maybe 15 minutes a night,'' he said. ``I don't speak
Spanish at all. I struggled. I have a hard time with Spanish. When
I first started reading, any word I didn't know I'd look up in a
Spanish-English dictionary. I'd make notes. Then I bought English
versions of the books and read a chapter in each, comparing, trying
to get the feel.''
</P>
<P>
   For his reading, he chose Jean Craighead George's ``My Side of
the Mountain'' and C.S. Lewis' ``Lion, the Witch and the
Wardrobe.'' ``I picked those because I like them,'' he said. ``The
weren't Odyssey; they weren't complicated reading.''
</P>
<P>
   DeFilippo said he hopes to be admitted to the Air Force Academy
or, alternately, to pursue environmental studies at an as yet
unselected university.
</P>
<P>
   DeFilippo's mother _ his father is John DeFilippo, a computer
account manager at CISCO Systems _ described her son as a selfless
teen who ``really likes people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm prejudiced,'' she said, ``but he really is very caring. He
puts other people before his own interests.''
</P>
<P>
   DeFilippo's brother, Anthony, is an engineering student at
Columbia University. His sister, Christina DeFilippo, 20, is a
sophomore at the University of Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a really good kid from a really good family,'' said
Becky Sheetz, Congressional Awards Foundation spokeswoman.

DOW WATCHERS' ALERT: HERE COMES OCTOBER DREAD  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 3)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   September, historically the worst month for the Dow Jones
industrial average, has been worse than normal. Now, here is
October, which is the second-worst month of the year for the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   And on Tuesday, Federal Reserve policy makers will meet to
decide whether to raise their short-term interest-rate target for
the third time since June.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow dropped 4.5 percent last month, its worst September
since 1990. Since 1915, the Dow has declined 0.68 percent, on
average, in September. For October, the Dow's average performance
is a decline of 0.05 percent. All other months are up.
</P>
<P>
   The decline of 6.33 percent in October 1997 was the worst recent
performance for the Dow. Though investors may have unhappy memories
of the summer and fall of 1998, September and October that year
turned out to be good and spectacular, in that order. The Dow rose
4.03 percent in September and 9.56 percent in October, the best
one-month performance since January 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Roger G. Ibbotson, a professor at the Yale School of Management
and chairman of Ibbotson Associates in Chicago, a market research
firm, doesn't think the threat of history, however, should make
investors flee the market. ``I just get a little bit more worried
in October,'' he said. ``But I don't tell people to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he seems hopeful about the outlook for stocks, taking a
long-term view that peers well beyond what the Fed will or will not
do this week. In the recent rage for predictions about how far the
Dow can go, he has set his marker at 120,040.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dow 36,000,'' a three-to-five year forecast and title of the
book by James K. Glassman and Kevin A. Hassett, already seems
pretty far-fetched. So what about 120,000?
</P>
<P>
   Well, Ibbotson doesn't get there until the end of 2025. He
doesn't get to Dow 36,000 until 2013, which shows how much the
magic of compounding plays into his prediction.
</P>
<P>
   His forecasting method is simple. Using the yield on the
Treasury's 30-year bond as a base, he adds the historical premium
that stocks earn over bonds, known as the equity risk premium,
because stocks are riskier. He subtracts the 1998 dividend yield
for the Dow of 1.6 percent, giving him an annual growth rate of 9.7
percent, starting in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The 120,000 sounds big. But Ibbotson is relatively conservative
given the current stock mania. His annual growth rate for the Dow
is lower than the performance so far this year _ 11.9 percent _ and
well below the 14.9 percent average annual rate of growth from 1990
through last year. If he used that rate, the Dow would hit 120,000
in 2017, the year it would just reach 56,000 in his forecast.
</P>
<P>
   But he is also assuming a risk premium for stocks of 5.7
percent, much higher than the 2.5 percent to 3 percent that many
bullish Wall Street strategists are using. He acknowledges that
others believe the risk of holding stocks is lower.
</P>
<P>
   And he says that his Dow forecast would be much lower using a
more modest equity risk premium. But he wants to stick, he says,
with the historical risk premium, based on data since 1926.
</P>
<P>
   Choose your historical period. The average annual growth for the
Dow since 1915 is 8.54 percent, according to Birinyi Associates in
Greenwich, Conn. That growth rate brings you to 120,000 in 2030. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE GOLD WATCH The rally in gold last week, in which the price
jumped 15 percent, to $308.10 an ounce, before settling at $305.30
on Friday, makes one wonder how closely European central bankers
watch the precious-metals market. With more than 16,200 tons of
gold in their vaults, the nearly 40 percent fall in the price since
1996 should have received their attention.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems that they realized only recently that the fear of a
flood of central bank gold sales had taken control of market
sentiment. Sales had been coming at a pace of 315 tons a year. So
when 15 European central banks announced that they would limit
their total sales to 400 tons a year for five years _ poof! _ gold
took off.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Banque de France, explained
it this way: ``When the Banque de France, the Bundesbank and the
Banca d'Italia, amongst others, were saying that they would not
sell gold, markets did not seem to understand this and did not seem
to be fully informed on this.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems that central bankers took too long to understand how
easily they could fully inform the market.

<P>
   I'm often (twice in the past 5 years) asked what it's like to be
married to a restaurant critic.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing you should know is that it's not as glamorous as
it sounds. Sure, you get to eat at fancy restaurants with
unpronounceable names and order whatever you want off the menu with
no thought of the cost, but that's only part of the story.
</P>
<P>
   Being the husband of a restaurant critic is a big
responsibility. It is my job to hand the car keys to the parking
valet, sneak out a menu and figure the tip. I have also been known
to give directions to the rest rooms, though that service is not
stipulated in my contract and is purely voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   My wife is supposed to dine anonymously and it's sometimes hard
for me not to ``blow her cover.'' If the service is slow, it takes
all the self-restraint I possess not to leap out of my chair and
scream, ``Hey, buddy! How about a little bread over here! Don't you
realize this woman's a restaurant critic?''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I go a little overboard trying not to look like I'm
dining with a restaurant critic, and that can cause problems, too.
Take it from someone who's ``been around the block'' a few times:
Loud burping, tucking the edge of the tablecloth under your chin
and stuffing six meatballs into your mouth at the same time tend to
attract, not deflect, attention.
</P>
<P>
   My wife likes to give a restaurant the benefit of the doubt when
it comes to food, wine and service, but as her dining-out
companion, I feel obliged to ``tell it like it is.'' Although I
think my wife appreciates my thoughtful, critical appraisal of the
cuisine (''They sure do give ya a great big ol' wad o' meat
here!''), I have had to ``tone down my act'' over the years, at my
spouse's insistence. When the soup is too hot, I no longer run
around the dining room clutching my throat and grabbing glasses of
ice water off other diners' tables. Also, when the bill comes, I
have learned to resist the urge to smack my forehead with the palm
of my hand and yell, ``Holy cow! What did we do, break a window?''
</P>
<P>
   Although I try to conscientiously appraise my food, I'm not
always sure what I'm eating. I have, for example, given high marks
to a roasted duck that turned out to be veal and I once mistook
peas for capers, which was just as well because I don't like peas.
</P>
<P>
   The primary reason for these misunderstandings is that I am an
unsophisticated lugnut who does not know a moose from a mousse. The
other reason is that I get confused by all the ``daily specials''
rattled off at tobacco-auctioneer speed by the waiter.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know who started the trend of reciting food items rather
than listing them on the menu, but whoever it was should be stood
up against a wall and shot or, better yet, forced to recite the
Declaration of Independence after hearing it read aloud only once.
</P>
<P>
   My mind a blank but pressured to come up with something, I wind
up ordering ``that thingamajig with mushrooms'' or ``one of the
first ones you said; you know, the smothered one.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately my wife, who has the kind of memory one normally
associates with professional bridge players, is able to keep it all
straight, which is fortunate since she is the one writing the
restaurant reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Also, it's my job to remember the doggie bags when we leave,
which is a big responsibility and not something your average
husband is capable of mastering without years of practice.

PUTIN MOVES TOWARD RUSSIAN-CONTROLLED RULE IN CHECHNYA

<P>
   MOSCOW _ In yet another sign that Russia is preparing for a
full-scale war with Chechnya, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said
Friday that the Kremlin no longer recognizes the breakaway
republic's democratically elected president and took the first
steps toward setting up a pro-Moscow puppet government-in-exile.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister's announcement came as Russian warplanes
pounded Chechnya for the ninth straight day and officials claimed
that government troops had seized strategic heights several miles
inside the separatist republic's borders.
</P>
<P>
   Russian news media have speculated that Russia, which rejects
Chechnya's claims to independence, may seize part of the territory
and install a rival government loyal to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Putin gave credence to that speculation Friday when he said that
an obscure pro-Moscow parliament, elected in 1996 when Russia's
military still occupied about half of Chechnya, was the only legal
authority in the rebel region.
</P>
<P>
   ``This parliament is the sole legitimate authority in Chechnya
and we give it full support,'' said Putin at a news conference.
``The legitimacy of all other bodies in Chechnya is, to put it
mildly, conditional, since they were not elected according to
Russian law.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement indicated the Kremlin was withdrawing
recognition from Chechnya's President Aslan Maskhadov, with whom
President Boris N. Yeltsin signed a peace accord in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-Moscow parliament was elected in June 1996 during
Russia's bloody and unsuccessful attempt to stop Chechnya from
gaining independence. At the time of the vote, Chechnya was a war
zone and Russian troops occupied about half the republic, including
the capital Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Amin Osmayev, speaker of the rump parliament, appeared with
Putin Friday and said that ``Mashkadov is not (Chechnya's)
legitimate president.''
</P>
<P>
   The parliament and a puppet government the Kremlin had installed
were disbanded and fled Chechnya after Russian troops withdrew late
in 1996. Since then Chechnya has run its own affairs, although no
country has recognized its independence.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1997 Chechnya held its own parliamentary and
presidential elections, which were monitored by international
observers. Maskhadov won the presidency in a landslide, taking 65
percent of the vote. The Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe, which monitored the vote, called Maskhadov's election
``democratic and free.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's announcement was criticized as folly by several analysts
and politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine what kind of advisers Vladimir Putin has if
they advised him to take this road,'' said Ruslan Aushev, president
of Ingushetia, a republic in southern Russia which borders
Chechnya. ``The legitimate leader of Chechnya today is President
Maskhadov whether anybody likes it or not.''

FOR FLEEING CHECHENS, AN ALL-TOO-FAMILIAR SITUATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTERN CHECHNYA, Russia _ The Arsagireyev family was preparing
for bed when they heard a loud explosion and the roar of a jet over
their home in a residential neighorhood in Chechnya's capital,
Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Startled and unsure what it meant, they turned on the TV and
watched as a Russian general explained that federal warplanes had
begun conducting ``pinpoint airstrikes'' against Islamic terrorists
suspected of hiding in the separatist Caucasus region.
</P>
<P>
   For eight days of terror, the Arsagireyevs huddled in their
basement as the rockets flew and their neighbors fled.
</P>
<P>
   The lights went out and the gas stopped working. The train
station blew up and the TV tower went down. The phones shut down
and the water stopped running. A family of refugees was hit as they
were crossing a bridge and six children were incinerated when a
rocket exploded where they were standing in the street.
</P>
<P>
   On the ninth day, Friday, the radio said all civilians had left
Grozny and there was nothing left in the city but bandits. The
implication was clear _ now everything was a target.
</P>
<P>
   The Arsagireyevs knew what that meant. They had twice fled heavy
fighting in Grozny during the 1994-1996 war between Russian forces
and separatist militants that killed tens of thousands of
civilians. Fearing a repeat of that nightmare, Berlan Arsagireyev,
59, gathered what belongings she could _ as well as eight of her
nine daughters and two small grandsons _ and joined the exodus. Her
husband and eldest daughter stayed behind to look after the family
homestead, under the rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the family members who escaped pondered their fate as
they sat on the side of a road clogged with cars and trucks heading
out of Chechnya to the west, toward the tiny southern Russian
region of Ingushetia, where some refugees have found places to stay
with friends or relatives.
</P>
<P>
   For the Arsagireyevs, sweating in 80-degree temperatures, there
was no place to go and no money for food. The nearby tent city that
Russian relief workers have thrown up was full, with a five-day
wait for space in a tent.
</P>
<P>
   So the Arsagireyevs got ready to spend the night in the open,
and repeated the bitter refrain so often heard from Chechens, whose
claim to independence is not recognized by Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are the bandits?'' said Mariam Arsagireyev, 19, the
youngest daughter, a sophomore ecology major at a Grozny
University. ``There is no reason why the Russians should want to
destroy us.''
</P>
<P>
   Their fate is shared by many of the 88,000 Chechens who Russian
officials say have fled the violence. Russia's sudden air campaign
against Chechnya took everyone by surprise, including Russian
relief agencies. Unable to accommodate all the refugees, Russia has
appealed to the United Nations for help. Four trucks carrying
tents, mattresses, food and other supplies arrived in Ingushetia
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But at a makeshift refugee camp on an unnamed field on the
Chechen-Ingush border, there was no sign of new supplies. Here,
some 3,000 refugees huddle in torn and crowded tents, sleeping on
straw. Food is whatever they brought from home, plus the bread
sporadically brought in by relief workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have is what you see,'' said Major Tugran Chepanov, a
Russian relief official. ``We have received no help yet.''
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of pregnant women and mothers with small children
gathered around a tent where Tamara Akhmedova, a doctor at nearby
hospital who fled Grozny during the 1995 fighting, conducts
perfunctory checkups. She has no antibiotics and little besides a
stool and a table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the children have colds from sleeping on the floor,''
she said. ``There's also diarrhea; these are not sanitary
conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   But people continued to stream into the camp Friday as Russian
warplanes again pounded Chechnya. As cars and trucks stuffed with
belongings crept towards Ingushetia, a large armored column of
Russian troops moved in the opposite direction toward Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The military situation around the separatist region's volatile
borders remained unclear. Russian political leaders said Thursday
that government troops had moved several miles inside Chechnya, but
the military declined to confirm or deny that a ground offensive
had begun.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has made it clear it will punish Chechen targets until
the region stops aiding and abetting the Islamic militants, whom
they blame for bringing crime and violence to the region. But
Russia denies its planes are targeting civilians.
</P>
<P>
   That is news to Audin Magomedov, who Friday left Grozny with his
wife and family after daily bombing had caused her to suffer a
nervous breakdown. As they left the city a rocket hit two families
of refugees, killing several people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us are just normal people who want to live normal
lives,'' Magomedov said. ``I wonder if the people ordering these
air strikes realize that. It is disgusting what they are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the people in the camps expressed sympathy for the
rebels Russia says it is fighting, the militants led by Chechen
renegade commander Shamil Basayev and his Saudi-born sidekick,
Khattab. Their forces twice invaded the southern Russian region of
Dagestan in August and September, and Russia blames them for the
wave of deadly apartment blasts that killed nearly 300 people in
Moscow and other cities last month.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the refugees see Basayev and Khattab, who say they are
fighting to end Russian rule in the Caucasus and unite Chechnya and
Dagestan in an Islamic republic, as their enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't stop (the Islamic rebels), then a new war is
unavoidable, not just for us but for the whole North Caucacus,''
said a slight young man who gave his name, Hadzhi, and the nickname
he picked up as a prisoner of war during the 1994-1996 conflict,
``The Executioner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Executioner'' and two comrades were taking their wives,
children, blankets, and a potted pepper plant out of Chechnya. Then
they were heading back home, they said, where they and some 400 of
their followers were planning a military operation to ``punish
those responsible'' for the new outbreak of fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Executioner'' did not elaborate on his plan. He only
predicted new upheavals and fighting in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our nation is destroyed every 50 years,'' he said. ``Every
generation has been through a war. We are used to it, but it's a
bad habit.''

 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in 1985, when President Ronald Reagan selected Edmund
Morris as his official biographer, the writer vowed he would
produce ``a substantial, scholarly book.'' Fourteen years later,
after years of worrying he didn't ``understand the first thing''
about his subject, Morris has produced a book that is anything but
scholarly or substantial. He has produced a bizarre, irresponsible
and monstrously self-absorbed book _ a Ragtime-esque ``memoir''
featuring a self-annotating narrator out of a Philip Roth novel and
childlike hero out of ``Being There.'' Even worse, this loony
hodgepodge of fact and fiction is being sold not as a novel but as
``the only biography ever authorized by a sitting president.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only does Morris' new book ``Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald
Reagan'' recapitulate the very blurring of reality and
stage-managed illusion that that president was often accused of
perpetrating, but it also underscores disturbing trends percolating
through biography writing and the culture at large today. Instead
of using his extraordinary access to a sitting president and his
personal papers to grapple with important matters like Iran-contra
or the end of the Cold War, Morris simply ratifies the familiar
mythology of Reagan as a charismatic actor blessed with a resonant
vision of America. And instead of working hard to evaluate Reagan
and his administration, Morris gives us pages and pages of
self-indulgent maundering about himself _ or rather, about a
fictional alter ego who knew Ronald Reagan as a teen-ager and who
pops up, Zelig-like, in later episodes of Reagan's life. We are
coyly told that Reagan rescued America ``in a time of poisonous
despair'' ... and also saved the fictional Morris from drowning as
a youth.
</P>
<P>
   This narrator is 28 years older than the real Morris, and has a
fictional son named Gavin, who is a political radical, and a
fictional friend named Paul Rae, who works as a gossip columnist.
The ersatz Morris blathers on at length about his romances, his
fictional family and his private regrets (``budding opportunities
unblown, breasts not cupped in my hands, scripts unfilmed and books
unfinished''). He resembles one of those academic
deconstructionists continually nattering on about how things exist
only in the beholder's eye. Or the narcissistic Ted Baxter on the
old ``Mary Tyler Moore Show,'' always making everything about
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Who cares, the reader wonders, whether Morris' ``fish-white
body'' earned him the nickname ``Moon-Tan''? Who cares whether
``happiness suffused'' Morris' heart when President Reagan
mentioned reading his biography of Theodore Roosevelt?
</P>
<P>
   Although Morris has repeatedly argued that he did not
fictionalize Reagan, his virtual narrator's ubiquity, not to
mention his youthful hero worship of the future president,
undermines all credibility. This narrator appears in the footnotes
to the book alongside real-life sources, and he makes the reader
think: if Morris won't tell the truth about himself, why should we
believe what he has to say about the president or anyone else?
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, Morris has described his use of this narrator as
``an advance in biographical honesty,'' a signal to the reader
concerning the subjective element involved in all writing. It is an
argument that recalls the disingenuous reasoning of Janet Malcolm,
who suggested in ``The Silent Woman,'' her highly partisan 1994
portrait of Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath, that all biographers share
her own disdain for fairness and objectivity. It is also an
argument that recalls the reasoning of current academic writers,
who preface scholarly papers with lengthy disquisitions on their
own ``positioning,'' their ethnic background, sexual identity and
personal experiences that might just possibly skew their arguments
or outlook.
</P>
<P>
   This approach _ what the scholar Daphne Patai aptly calls ``the
nouveau solipsism'' _ does not hold, as the old scholarship did,
that truth, however fragmentary and provisional, is an end worth
trying to pursue. Instead, it assumes that writers are
intrinsically biased by their own demographics, that, in Ms.
Patai's words, ``men cannot speak for women, one group of women
cannot speak for another.'' Hence, perhaps, the decision of Morris,
who was born in Kenya in 1940, to turn himself, in ``Dutch,'' into
a Reagan contemporary _ an American born in 1912 who migrates from
the Middle West to Hollywood and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   All too often, this sort of ``moi criticism'' _ as the writer
Leslie Heywood dubbed her use of personal anecdotes about anorexia
in a 1996 study of literary modernism _ simply gives an author
license to substitute personal talk show-style testimony for the
careful weighing of available evidence, to substitute polemic and
lazy speculation for hard-won argument and research.

EX-ENVOY URGES RUSSIA TO AVOID CHECHEN WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID BEARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who stood
close to Moscow during its 1994-96 war in Chechnya, edged away
Friday, emphatically urging the Kremlin to steer clear from another
full-fledged conflict there.
</P>
<P>
   As Russian warplanes bombed Chechnya and refugees streamed from
the southern region, Talbott declared that Russia must embrace
peaceful solutions in the volatile area or risk deep and violent
dissent for years. Hours after Prime Minister Vladimir Putin
snubbed Chechnya's moderate leader by endorsing a puppet group of
pro-Moscow legislators as the region's leaders, Talbott was urging
Russia to work with the moderates instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``For there to be any chance of success, Russia must show
restraint and wisdom in the coming weeks. This means taking action
against real terrorists, but not using indiscriminate force that
endangers innocents or resuming the disastrous 1994-96 war in
Chechnya,'' Talbott told a crowd at Harvard University's John F.
Kennedy School of Government.
</P>
<P>
   In comments there, and to a group of editors at the Globe,
Talbott, the State Department's senior Russian expert, also
lambasted Moscow's wholesale roundups and deportations of an
estimated 10,000 people of darker complexions _ often associated
with the southern Caucacus region that includes Chechyna.
</P>
<P>
   ``This, too, is not just an ugly and atavistic development but
an ominous one _ and, I believe, profoundly contrary to Russia's
own interests,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is taking a careful line on who is responsible for a
terrorist bombing campaign that prompted both the crackdown in
Moscow and the intensifying military attack on Chechnya. Moscow has
blamed Islamic separatists based in Chechnya for the attacks, but
Washington has not entirely accepted that explanation _ nor has it
supported speculation that another group carried out the series of
apartment bombings.
</P>
<P>
   A concern amid the attacks on Chechnya is that a new Chechen
conflict will spill over or destabilize other formerly Soviet areas
such as Georgia or Azerbaijan. Unlike Russia's conflict with
Chechnya in 1994-96, when Washington stuck with Boris N. Yeltsin in
fear of a Communist rollback in Moscow, the United States is less
firmly aligned now with the Russian leadership, which Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright has criticized for widespread corruption
and Central Bank money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott's Harvard speech sought to emphasize that Russia,
despite its myriad troubles this decade, may still become a modern
state. He pointed to the excitement over upcoming parliamentary and
presidential elections as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more firmly established that mechnanism becomes, the
longer it continues to function, the greater the chance of having a
government _ and a state _ more responsive to the needs of the
citizenry,'' Talbott said. ``This would be something new under the
Russian sun.''

 UNDATED: and research.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the case of ``Dutch,'' Morris tends to play down anything
that transpired in the Reagan administration that he did not happen
to witness himself, eschewing the sort of reportorial legwork and
archival research that might have enabled him to more fully assess
the president's character and his foreign and domestic policies.
Earlier events in Reagan's life, of course, are filtered through
his virtual narrator's mind.
</P>
<P>
   Morris reports the rumor that Reagan tried to become a Communist
during his early years in Hollywood (and was discouraged by a local
party leader), but never really determines its accuracy: ``So
what,'' he shrugs, ``if Dutch, young and ardent in 1938, thrilled
to the message of Marx for a few experimental months?''
</P>
<P>
   As for the funneling of Iranian funds to Contra operations in
Central America, Morris reports his ``suspicion'' that ``Dutch did
authorize the transfer, not having the smallest comprehension of
the laws he was subverting,'' but leaves serious reporting to
others, arguing he is simply ``writing Dutch's personal story, and
not correlating the millions of impressions of the hundreds of
witnesses whose testimony fills more than 50,000 pages of
documents.'' Analysis of such testimony, after all, might interrupt
the user-friendly flow of Morris' narrative, a narrative weighted,
like so much writing in our post-Monica, post-Matt Drudge era,
toward the sensational and the private.
</P>
<P>
   This is Morris, ``the Official Biographer,'' on the future
president of the United States: ``Even his pectorals are flat and
square: he has no bulges in him, of brawn or brain.'' This is
Morris on the future first lady: ``Her figure _ 5 feet 4 inches of
pile-driver purpose _ was more suited to table-hopping than couch
football. She was not averse to sex, as Dutch would discover.''
</P>
<P>
   While the chatty, you-are-there style of ``Dutch'' is a kind of
extrapolation of methods used in Bob Woodward's political books
(which blithely tell us what various people thought or felt on a
given occasion, even when they were not directly interviewed by the
author) and Joe McGinniss' egregious ``Last Brother'' (which
employed wholesale speculation to try to convey ``what it might
have been like to be Teddy Kennedy''), the book as a whole also
points up the contamination of biography writing that has
accelerated during the last decade or so.
</P>
<P>
   Those years saw the publication of many exemplary works of
biography _ from A.N. Wilson's vivid life of Tolstoy to Joseph
Ellis' sympathetic portrait of John Adams to the riveting first
volume of Peter Guralnick's biography of Elvis Presley _ but they
also bore witness to the proliferation of ``pathographies,'' those
lurid, voyeuristic works that relentlessly focus on a subject's
foibles and failings (Jeffrey Meyers' ``Scott Fitzgerald,'' Ronald
Hayman's ``Tennessee Williams,'' Joan Peyser's ``Bernstein,'' to
name just a few).
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, we have become all too familiar with the
phenomenon of biography as spin job (Andrew Morton's ``Diana: Her
True Story,'' Jonathan Dimbleby's ``The Prince of Wales''),
biography as feminist tract (Francine du Plessix Gray's ``Rage and
Fire: A Life of Louise Colet''), biography as deconstructionist
exercise (S. Paige Baty's ``American Monroe: The Making of a Body
Politic''), and biography as philosophical manifesto (Norman
Mailer's ``Portrait of Picasso as a Young Man''). Mailer and Ms.
Baty at least make it clear that they are writing interpretative
studies; in many cases, editorializing is simply woven into what
purports to be a standard life.
</P>
<P>
   Part of this has to do with the tenor of the times: the erasure
of the lines between opinion and fact, the tabloidization of the
cultural zeitgeist and the relativistic approach to truth fostered
by identity politics. It also has something to do with the growing
desire on the part of biography writers like Morris to be
``creative,'' to think of themselves, in Justin Kaplan's words,
``not as post-mortem amanuenses but as writers, even participants,
agonistic heroes and joint tenants in ongoing posthumous lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make literature out of Ronald Reagan,'' said Morris,
who in this book lays out his impressions of the president in a
cringe-making mixture of screenplay scenarios, phony letters, poems
and bad novelistic prose. ``Dutch,'' a Random House publicity
release reads, ``is a unique literary achievement,'' enlivened ``by
a poetic sensibility.''
</P>
<P>
   There are precedents, of sorts, for Morris' strange approach. In
his 1991 biography of Dickens, Peter Ackroyd imagined encounters
between the novelist, his characters, other famous writers and
himself. In her 1995 book about the duchess of Windsor, Caroline
Blackwood turned her own frustrating efforts to come to terms with
her elusive subject into the volume's central story line. And in
her 1989 biography of Josephine Baker, Phyllis Rose wrote of
identifying so strongly with the dancer that she perhaps imposed on
her ``some of my own sensibility.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am getting too interested in myself, which is the mark of
the burned-out biographer,'' Ms. Rose wrote in an essay several
years later. ``The burned-out biographer is no longer willing to
suppress herself in the service of another. She no longer wants to
express indirectly in terms of the narrative of another's life the
burning issues of her own. That interrogation by the self of
another, which animates a good biography, no longer works. The self
wants center stage, the whole enchilada.''
</P>
<P>
   That, apparently, is what happened to Edmund Morris. By turning
his biography into the work of a novelist manque, he could show
readers he could write _ not just the sort of sedate prose that won
him the Pulitzer Prize in 1980 for his biography of Teddy
Roosevelt, but also something more purple and poetic. (``All his
life, Ronald Reagan has ridden a long road dissolving, at the limit
of sight, into something scintillant yet ethereal.'') By tricking
up his narrative with the distracting pyrotechniques of fiction, he
could try to conceal his own inability to understand his subject _
never mind the fact that earlier biographers like Lou Cannon and
Garry Wills, and dozens of reporters with considerably less access,
managed to make sense of Reagan in the past. And by turning himself
into a central character in the former president's story, he could
absolve himself of the responsibility of trying to rise above his
personal feelings and turn his simultaneous adoration and contempt
for the man into a post-modern narrative device.
</P>
<P>
   There may, of course, be something fitting about America's first
actor-turned-president (whose carefully scripted White House was
predicated on perception, whose view of the past, in Wills' words,
was ``largely shaped by the movies he saw or made'') getting a
biographer who freely glosses history with fantasy, who values
style over substance. There may also be something fitting about a
man renowned for his contradictions (a ``hemophilic liberal'' who
became a conservative poster boy, a big-government hater who
created a huge national debt) getting a biographer who argues that
Reagan was ``a great president'' and ``an apparent airhead''
endowed with an ``encyclopedic ignorance.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that a rare opportunity to chronicle a sitting
president in office has been squandered, while readers have been
cheated: under the guise of an authorized biography of Reagan we
get a cloying, egocentric novel; instead of a revealing portrait of
a president, we get a phony self-portrait of the president's
would-be Boswell, another self-absorbed Ted Baxter doggedly hogging
the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan once wrote an autobiography called ``Where's the Rest of
Me?'' The rest of him is decidedly not to be found in ``Dutch,'' a
book that might well have been titled ``The Rest of Edmund
Morris.''

AIRLINES SHOULD BE UNFAZED BY Y2K `BUG,' GROUP SAYS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The nation's major airlines and airports should function
smoothly on New Year's Day, but they are hammering out contingency
plans in case computers are fouled by the date change, officials
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be as safe to fly on Jan. 1 as it is today,'' vowed
Tom Browne, executive director of the Aviation Millennium Project,
the Year 2000 program for the Air Transport Association in
Washington, the trade association group which represents virutally
all of the nation's major airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Because so much of the aviation system is interconnected, the
Aviation Millennium Project has compiled information for 102 North
American airlines to use, as well as some 500 airports, pertaining
to 9,000 computer-dependent systems ranging from baggage systems to
airport runway lights.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration, which is responsible for
the computer-dependent air traffic control system, has been working
to make sure the system functions on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we have been looking at tells us we are ready,''
said Robert Bartanowicz, the New England regional administrator of
the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   Browne said about ``99.9 percent'' of airline systems in the
United States have been tested and validated to be year 2000
compliant. Avionics equipment on board airplanes has been tested by
Boeing, Airbus and the equipment manufacturers. Three systems were
found to have problems, and they have been replaced or corrected.
The airplane manufacturers have flight tested every plane, Browne
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coffee maker might not work, but there are no
safety-of-flight issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   US and Canadian airlines have spent about $750 million on
solving the so-called Y2K problem, and the two-year budget for the
Aviation Millennium Project is $16 million.
</P>
<P>
   There is some concern that if there are significant failures in
the system, planes will be delayed and travelers stranded as the
air traffic control system is slowed down and planes spaced further
apart to ensure that safety is maintained.
</P>
<P>
   Some carriers, including American Airlines, have announced
reduced service on Dec. 31 and Jan. 1, but Browne said those flight
cancellations were because of low advance bookings, not concern
about Year 2000 problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest party night of the last millennium, and
people are not going to want to be on a plane when the partying
starts or ends,'' he said. ``If airlines were really concerned
about Y2K, the reduction of schedules would not be for 12 hours; it
would be much longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Tara Werho, general manager of the Year 2000 Program at Delta
Air Lines said the airline has spent about $90 million on fixes,
and everything is ``100 percent complete.'' She said work on about
230 systems was completed in June. That work now is being validated
by independent consultants, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Anglin, director of information services at the
Massachusetts Port Authority, which owns and operates Logan
International Airport, said the agency has spent about $5.5 million
on making certain everything functions smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 111 Massport computer systems tested, 27 percent ``had
problems,'' including some important ones controlling airfield
lighting, security control, and fuel distribution. Those systems
have been fixed and are being tested, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Anglin added, ``We do have a contingency plan to keep the
airport operational if something happens with power or
telephones.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Massport officials will be in contact with airport
managers in Australia and England on Dec. 31 to see how those
airfields, where the New Year arrives earlier, manage at the stroke
of midnight and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Anglin said, Massport will be in touch with West
Coast airports when it is midnight here.

ACID RAIN DEADLINES UNMET, ENVIRONMENTALISTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fifteen months after New England governors and eastern Canadian
premiers vowed to crack down on acid rain and mercury pollution,
they are already falling behind on their self-imposed deadlines,
environmentalists charged Friday. If anything, pollution from the
region's power plants is rising, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint, contained in a letter signed by representatives
of 45 environmental groups, went to the state and provincial
leaders as they prepare for a three-day meeting beginning Monday in
Rockland, Maine, where air pollution will be on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a disconnect between our public officials and
what the public thinks and how deeply these sentiments run,'' said
Cindy Luppi of the environmental group Clean Water Action in
Boston. ``New England is one of the most hard hit regions in the
country by both acid rain and mercury.''
</P>
<P>
   Acid rain and mercury deposition do major environmental damage
in the Northeast, from Vermont forests killed by high acidity to
scores of lakes and streams where the fish are unsafe to eat due to
high mercury levels. New England is especially vulnerable because
its pollution comes from both local sources and windblown emissions
from Midwestern coal-burning plants.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the New England Governors' Conference conceded that
the activists were technically correct that regional leaders missed
a May deadline to come up with ways to cut releases of toxic
mercury. However, they said the protest letter overlooks major
progress in other areas, such as reducing mercury emissions from
trash incinerators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the first year of a multi-year plan and we've done a
lot already,'' said John Shea, spokesman for the governors
conference. ``A plan like this is beyond anything anybody else is
doing so it becomes kind of a target . . . Sometimes it gets a
little frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   The sparring comes little more than a year after the political
leaders and environmentalists jointly celebrated the governors' and
premiers' landmark agreement to tackle both acid rain and mercury
pollution, promising to make coal-burning power plants install
state-of-the-art mercury pollution controls and to cut emissions of
sulfur, the main ingredient in acid rain, in half by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Northeast's resolution has no effect on pollution
drifting in from other regions, the political leaders said it would
give them moral authority in demanding that Midwestern states clean
up their old power plants whose super-tall smokestacks send air
pollution here.
</P>
<P>
   But, almost as soon as the crackdown was approved, states and
provinces ran into objections from the industries likely to bear
the brunt of it, coal-burning power plants and trash incinerators.
Last month, the incinerator industry sued Massachusetts to overturn
new limits on mercury emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Now, environmentalists fear that the governors and premiers are
squandering their moral authority just when it's needed most. US
Representative Tom Allen of Maine, backed by the Massachusetts
delegation, plans to announce a bill Saturday to require pollution
reductions at the dirtiest power plants nationwide, and the state
of New York recently sued several Midwestern governments to
accomplish a similar goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that unless our officials in New England come up with
good strong precedents, it is very unlikely that there will be any
progress nationally,'' said Luppi.
</P>
<P>
   But Shea of the New England Governors Conference said the US and
Canadian leaders are making far more progress than
environmentalists give them credit for. He said new initiatives to
reduce mercury releases from hospitals, municipal facilities and
incinerators will cut overall mercury emissions in the region by 40
percent, assuming the Massachusetts incinerator rules survive their
legal challenge.
</P>
<P>
   He conceded that the governors and premiers haven't come up with
ways to limit mercury from coal burning plants yet, but he said
that is partly because controlling mercury from coal-burning is
costly _ anywhere from five to 300 times the cost of controlling
mercury releases from trash incinerators.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of concern within the utility sector of the
costs and the technical feasibility of some of these options,''
said Shea. ``That's why we are taking our time trying to develop a
set of options . . . that will be feasible and not rush out with
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, say environmentalists, the result is that many
Northeastern power plants, spurred by the hot regional economy, are
increasing releases of sulfur and mercury. Sulfur releases from the
five most polluting power plants in Massachusett rose by 50 percent
from 1996 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are disappointed that there does not seem to be the
followthrough on the commitment they unveiled with great fanfare,''
said Rob Sargent of the Massachusetts Public Interest Research
Group. ``There has to be clear action now to show that they are
serious.''

`THE OXFORD BOOK OF WORK': FOR BEGGARS OR BIG SHOTS, WORK IS A
HUMAN CONDITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(js) 
 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The word for ``work'' in French _ ``travail'' _ is derived from
the Latin ``trepalium,'' an instrument of torture. And is there any
doubt that in the course of the nasty, brutish and short lives of
humankind, work has often been indistinguishable from torture? But
the word ``labor'' derives from the Old French word ``labeur,''
meaning ``ploughing,'' an activity that, however difficult, is also
a declaration of victory over natural forces. Ploughing cultivates;
it reflects a plan; it organizes both time and space; it creates
culture. And is there any doubt, that work also has this quality?
If work is, as we now commonly say, ``dehumanizing,'' it is also
distinctly and deeply human.
</P>
<P>
   There may be no reconciliation between work as torture and work
as cultivation, judging from ``The Oxford Book of Work,'' a massive
anthology of writings compiled by Keith Thomas, the president of
Corpus Christi College of Oxford. ``What a dreary subject!'' he
recalls his friends saying when he announced his ambitions to
gather literary and historical material on the theme of work. But
also, in all its contradictions and variety, what an astonishing
one.
</P>
<P>
   Once the subject is unleashed, it seems to have no bounds. Mark
Twain's Tom Sawyer teases his friends into trading their most
cherished trinkets for the right to whitewash his fence. Tolstoy's
Levin, beginning to doubt the foundations of his urban life, works
with the peasants in the fields. A professional sword swallower in
1850 recalls how he began at his trade, forcing the first stick
down his throat into his stomach. George Orwell wryly speculates
that the beggar is universally despised not because he is without
honor or pride but because he is so unsuccessful at his chosen
metier: ``He has merely made the mistake of choosing a trade at
which it is impossible to grow rich.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor also regularly inspires advice. An Egyptian homily from
the 14th century B.C. warns the reader about the host of
tribulations facing the mason, the gardener, the weaver and the
bird-catcher, only to offer a rather questionable occupational
recommendation: ``See, there's no profession without a boss,/Except
for the scribe; he is the boss.'' A more realistic homily of
corporate efficiency appears in the familiar law formulated by C.
Northcote Parkinson in 1958: ``Work expands so as to fill the time
available for its completion.''
</P>
<P>
   It also expands under contemplation. In 1980, the British
government listed 23,000 different occupations. Walt Whitman
celebrated manual labor in cascading lists: ``Leather-dressing,
coach-making, boiler-making, rope-twisting, distilling,
sign-painting, lime-burning, cotton-picking . . . '' But there are
also the horrors of such manual labors, evident in an 1897 magazine
account of the ``fur-pullers'' of London whose job it is to remove
long coarse hairs from rabbit skins: ``The choking sensation caused
by the passage of the hairs into the throat, and the nausea from
the smell of the skins, is at first almost too overpowering for
speech.''
</P>
<P>
   So what is one to make of this anthology's phantasmagoric
mixture of wit and witness? Some attempt is made to organize the
selections in grand thematic categories, like ``The Primal Curse,''
``Compensations and Rewards,'' or ``Women's Work and Child Labor.''
But the organization is often arbitrary, and within each category
the sequence is neither chronological nor clearly thematic. And why
should the reader have to do the work of turning the pages to find
its author and date when that information should precede each
selection? It also would have been helpful to limit the number of
repetitious examples in favor of more expansive selections from
Dickens, Dreiser, Hardy or Zola. It might even have been useful to
have a section on the history of labor unions, or one on the
philosophy of work, in which Hobbes, Marx and more recent
economists and political thinkers could have outlined contrasting
interpretations of labor and its discontents.
</P>
<P>
   But in his brief introduction, Thomas provides some hints about
what sort of shape might be given to a history of work, a subject
that has inspired a small academic industry in recent years. The
abstract concept of work, he points out, is a modern one. In the
pre-modern world, slaves and prisoners often made up the bulk of
workers; labor was also associated with particular classes. Until
labor became a ``commodity,'' as Hobbes put it, and was traded for
wages, it hardly seemed worth analyzing in itself. It was simply a
condition of life, having all the natural force of God's punishment
of Adam in Eden.
</P>
<P>
   The anthology's selections show, though, just how important a
transformation took place in the 19th century. Factories and coal
mines are horrifically described in novels; the hypocrisies of the
office are skewered. Marx placed the experience of work at the
center of human consciousness; Engels considered labor an
evolutionary shaper of the body as well as the mind. This may not
have been because the workplaces themselves were more brutal than
any ever constructed (they probably were not), but because, perhaps
for the first time in history, it was possible to imagine that
things could be different. Work could create a surplus, so why
couldn't the surplus alleviate work? On a wide scale, work began to
promise the possibility of nonwork. Labor offered the prospect of
leisure.
</P>
<P>
   So it may be that the reform of the workplace, the
transformation of the household, the beginnings of labor laws and
the formation of unions were in part reflections of this change,
not just causes of it. Marx wrote that labor ``produces culture,
but also imbecility and cretinism for the worker.'' The question
some future anthologist might think about is what happens when
work's tortuous claims weaken and when the goal of work is to make
nonwork possible _ the welcome situation now for many in the
Western world. Is culture then also remade, in the image not of
cultivated labor but of pleasurable leisure? It sometimes seems so.

TOYS `R' US WORKS TO PREVENT MISHAPS THAT HURT IT LAST HOLIDAY
SEASON

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last fall, Toys ``R'' Us shoppers, armed with holiday wish
lists, often left the chain's cavernous stores frustrated and
empty-handed. It was not just the hot sellers like Furby that were
in short supply. The stores even ran out of stocking-stuffers like
Crayola Crayons. And the company felt the pain acutely in its
bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   But what of this year? As the company heads into the
all-important Christmas season, with Walmart and Etoys continuing
to snatch a big share of its business, Toys ``R'' Us is trying
mightily to do things differently.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it is hoping to avoid a repeat of last year by
placing bigger bets on top-selling toys like Furby and Pokemon as
well as must-have items like Potato Head. But even if it succeeds _
and that is very much an open question _ it would take several
quarters of solid results for the company to get back in investors'
good graces, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate fate of Toys ``R'' Us, which throughout the 1980s
bestrode the nation's toy industry like a giant Jesse Ventura doll,
depends in large part on how successful it is in mending its
bruised relationship with its suppliers _ the ones it must rely on
to get toys on its shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Toy makers became frustrated last year with management's
haphazard handling of its inventory and failure to communicate with
key customers. But since its previous chief executive resigned in
August, Michael Goldstein, the chairman and now acting chief
executive, has been busily calling industry chums to try to ease
the tension.
</P>
<P>
   In but one case of communications breakdown, Mattel Inc. sales
representatives warned Toys ``R'' Us buyers early last year that
the chain risked running out of some popular Fisher-Price items
during the holidays and should probably order more. But Toys ``R''
Us, trying to shave costs largely by unloading warehouses full of
slow-moving merchandise, did not listen. When December came, many
of its 700 stores ran out of Fisher-Price's Magnadoodles and Little
People play houses. Not only did this hurt Toys ``R'' Us, but it
caused Mattel to stumble, cutting into its revenue last year by
about $350 million.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``They were ordering only when necessary as opposed to taking
some direction on what we felt they needed to order to stay in
stock,'' said Fisher-Price president Neil Friedman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vendor relationship is very important. They have to be
able to trust us and we have to be able to trust them. That is
something that has never been a problem with Toys `R' Us prior to
that year.'' But on a more optimistic note, he added, ``I think all
of those issues are past.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us' troubles are far from over. Its profits are still
tumbling, and its stock price is off 40 percent from the year's
high, closing Friday at $14.8125. Walmart, after all, earlier this
year stole the title of top toy seller, while Etoys has become the
Toys ``R'' Us of online toy selling. And the chain still has work
to do to win back customers who had grown weary of its
warehouse-like stores and dismal customer service _ a problem it is
also trying to address with an extensive program to retrain all
workers and managers.
</P>
<P>
   But heading into the year's final quarter, when toy makers and
retailers typically earn more than half their annual profits, Toys
``R'' Us _ according to suppliers and industry experts _ has a
better merchandising mix and will have enough of the stuff people
want. In short, it is no longer operating like a closeout chain
offering bargains on toy-chest rejects.
</P>
<P>
   Even Toys ``R'' Us management admits that its obsession with
winnowing inventory got out of control last year, and that top
executives had to step in to smooth over wrinkles in relations with
companies like Mattel, which last year described the reduced orders
from Toys ``R'' Us as ``very painful and disappointing for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, who is filling in until a replacement is named for
Robert Nakasone, the chief executive who resigned abruptly under
board pressure, said, ``If you talk to vendors about what the
issues were, it gets back to the point that the partnership was too
adversarial.'' Goldstein has personally called on large
manufacturers that Toys ``R'' Us executives had not visited in
years, as well as small but important ones that had also been
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   He has assured those toy makers that the company is now open to
more suggestions about what will sell, invited them to visit the
chain's spruced-up stores and sent a message that unresolved issues
will be handled by top management.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``They are just bringing everybody back into the family in a
sense,'' said Stephen Berman, co-founder and president of Jakks
Pacific Inc., maker of World Wrestling Federation action figures,
who said his company has not had a problem with Toys ``R'' Us but
has, nonetheless, noticed a new era of openness at the company.
</P>
<P>
   The schmoozing helps, but Toys ``R'' Us has also finally begun
to show some competitive spunk. Two weeks ago it introduced Pokemon
leagues in stores, prompting thousands of youngsters to sign up to
compete in six-week competitions involving the trading cards'
imaginary creatures.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, after an embarrassingly unsuccessful dabble in
cyber selling, Toys ``R'' Us is reviving its website
(www.toyrus.com) in October month to go toe-to-toe with Etoys,
Amazon and the growing list of online toy sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect Toys ``R'' Us to finally do what critics say it
should have done in the first place _ promote the new site heavily
on television and in national print adds, play up customers'
ability to return goods bought on line to its hundreds of stores
and offer exclusive deals to lure shoppers.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In September, Toys ``R'' Us smartly found a way to one-up the
discount chains, which have lured the retailer's once-loyal
shoppers by cutting prices. Walmart, Etoys and other retailers were
selling the Sega Dreamcast system for $199, and Toys ``R'' Us
matched that price, but offered an added incentive.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for bringing in old video game systems when they
purchased Dreamcasts, the company offered shoppers $100 worth of
``Geoffry Dollars,'' toy money named for the chain's giraffe mascot
that could be used to purchase any item in its stores. As a result,
many consumers traded up to the new game system and spent the play
money on accessories to go with it, which enabled Toys ``R'' Us to
sell more Dreamcasts than its competitors, luring new customers in
the process, said Jim Silver, publisher of Toy Book, a trade
publication, and co-publisher of a new toy-buying guide, Toy
Wishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``By heavily couponing, they can compete because they offer
deals like Sega Dreamcast that bring people in stores,'' Silver
said.
</P>
<P>
   But change will not come overnight. ``A lot of things, the
redesigned stores, the push and pull here and there, it sounds in
theory good, but I think it may take a while before customers
really notice an improvement,'' said Maureen Carini, an analyst
with Standard &AMP; Poors Equity Group. ``I'm not looking really for
any short-term big changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street has good reason for its wait-and-see attitude. The
company turned in its seventh quarterly earnings decline in August,
reporting a 25 percent drop, to $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   And any changes that followed Nakasone's departure, even though
it came before most shoppers were thinking about the holiday
splurge ahead, will have little impact soon, because toy retailers
lock in their merchandise orders and promotional budgets and
strategies months ahead of the season. Nakasone could not be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Since his departure, Toys ``R'' Us may have gotten back in the
good graces of its suppliers, but it will take far longer to win
over customers and investors. For just that reason, the most
important change for Toys ``R'' Us may well be not the number of
Millennium Barbies sitting on its shelves on Dec. 24, but whom it
brings in to lead the company into the next century _ and how well
that person executes the strategy Goldstein and team have begun. As
of now, there is no clue who that person will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``This might be the most important hire Michael Goldstein
makes,'' said Silver, the trade magazine publisher. ``A lot of
people have been brought in through the years, but this will be
watched more closely and have more impact than any in the past.
With all the problems, this one has to be right.''

 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   McLEAN, Va. _ This vernal, affluent suburb of Washington is
known for the discreet coexistence of the CIA and Patrick Buchanan,
the maverick presidential candidate who lately takes pre-dawn jogs
around his CIA neighbor's perimeter, all the better to plot his
next intrigue against the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exhilarating, waking up at three in the morning, running,
planning things,'' says Buchanan, describing a Napoleonic edge to
his aerobics in his current threat to spurn the GOP and make a run
for the Reform Party nomination. ``You think of what you're going
to say, how they'll come at you in sound bites, how much time
you'll have to make your proper point. Very exhilarating.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, far from flinching from a two-week bout of controversy
over his isolationist views on America's involvement in World War
II, seems exultant. He believes he has mastered, not merely
weathered, a ``firestorm'' that one of his mentors, President
Richard M. Nixon, taught him can only add strength to a quixotic
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Galvanized by being targeted, Buchanan avidly discussed one
theoretical battle plan in an interview at his home in McLean. He
estimated that he could likely wrest the Reform nomination from his
opponents in that party, collect the resultant $12.6 million in
federal campaign subsidy to get off the ground, and maintain enough
of an insurgent free-media blitz next year to register 15 percent
approval in presidential campaign polls. This would earn him a
place in the critical televised debates, where Buchanan envisions
his best haymaker shot at undoing the big-money candidacies of the
other two nominees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we go, we would have a fighting chance,'' he said, claiming
polls show him defeating other possible Reform rivals, including
his most serious opponent in that party, Minnesota Gov. Jesse
Ventura, who has thus far said he will not seek the nomination
himself but has also expressed opposition to Buchanan getting it.

   ``Ross Perot would be a benign neutral, I think, and Ventura
would not,'' Buchanan said of the former professional wrestler. ``I
think he has in mind body-slamming me,'' he added with a sudden
grin of delight in the virtual warfare that he likes to make of
politics.

<P>
   ``You're up there on that high diving board, my friend,''
Buchanan said, offering the image of himself poised in presumed
uncertainty about the party switch. He smiled, relaxing in his
handsome library stocked with biographies of political and military
leaders. ``It seems a thousand feet down to the water. It's go or
no-go. If I come down that ladder, you know what people will say,''
he continued, looking pleased enough at the sheer political anxiety
he is teasing out with his threat.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   As the forces of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the GOP
front-runner, plead with Buchanan not to attempt to create a
three-way race, some fellow conservatives have begun denouncing him
as an ego-tripper and hypocrite driven to flirting with fringe
politicians of the Marxist left and madcap right. In reply,
Buchanan mainly beams at all the attention that he knows attends
political controversy. No one laughs harder than he at some of the
anomalies of his courting the more exotic Reform politicians, like
Lenora Fulani, the New York figure associated with such
controversial firebrands as Louis Farrakhan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only going to say this just once: I did not have sex with
that woman,'' Buchanan sternly declared, then guffawed in mocking
the disapproving talk of his recent lunch meeting with Ms. Fulani.
``I did not convert to Marxism,'' Buchanan continued, and described
a luncheon discussion of mainline social and political ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in Beijing in 1972 when Richard Nixon toasted the
greatest mass murderer of all time, Mao Tse-tung,'' Buchanan
continued. ``If we can do that, why is it wrong for me to have a
Caesar salad with Lenora Fulani? This is absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   His barking laughter rang through the stately home that the
60-year-old conservative politician earned across decades of work
in Republican politics and cable television as a celebrity
polemicist turned chronic candidate.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   As he mused upon the opportunities and risks of a Reform run,
Buchanan seemed more excited than nonplussed. ``I think I can hear
the distant sound of bugles,'' he lightly allowed, as if the
``pitchfork brigade'' supporters of his earlier presidential runs
had somehow found their way to the curved driveway of his home.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As he contemplates switching to the Reform Party, Buchanan is
drawing fire from some conservative stalwarts, including radio
talk-show host Rush Limbaugh.
</P>
<P>
   Respected as a canny wordsmith, Buchanan was asked about one
criticism, by conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer, that he
softens his candidate image on television and mutes his
sharpest-edged views. Buchanan wrote last year, for example, that
``non-Jewish whites'' ``get the shaft'' at Harvard where, he
contended, admission favors Jews and Asians.
</P>
<P>
   Dogged for years by accusations of anti-Semitism, Buchanan
contended in a recent TV interview that the Harvard comment was
intended ``tongue in cheek.'' But Krauthammer quickly wrote that
there was not a hint of irony in the complaint's angry wording on
behalf of ``white Christians.'' He accused the supposedly candid
Buchanan of going ``impish and squishy'' in his TV persona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you do everything perfectly?'' Buchanan responded when
asked about this at home in McLean. ``Of course not. But look, I
believe this is by and large rooted in hostility and malice towards
me because it only bursts out when I'm doing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Current controversy centers on his new book about foreign
policy, but he feels this was unfairly seized upon once his
political enemies realized he might seek a third-party outlet.
``They thought I was dead,'' he observed. ``Then they saw the
casket lid open and the arm come out and they said, `Oh my Lord,
it's him again.'''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan insisted he has not made a final decision about party
switching, even though he conceded that it would seem ludicrous if
not cowardly to come down that ladder now as the alternative to
taking a ``swan-dive of humiliation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be parturition,'' he said of the pain of his
possible _ many politicians guess all-but-certain _ decision to
quit the Republican Party, where his standing in pre-primary polls
has been merely single digit. ``Whatever you do, there's no doubt
you're going to wound yourself forever with people who have been
your friends and supporters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we go, this is going to be the darnedest coalition you've
ever seen,'' he enthused. ``All kinds of disenchanted people. Can
you put together a left-right-center coalition for a single brief
campaign?''
</P>
<P>
   As an avid history buff, Buchanan had to concede third-party
politics historically yields a spoiler's role at best, not outright
triumph. ``It may be possible and it may not,'' he said. ``But the
whole challenge of something like that is very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan claimed a political realignment of the two parties is
already under way with an internationalist approach by one major
faction and what he called a ``Buchananite'' outlook in the other
opposed to global free trade, military intervention and large-scale
immigration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may end up hurting, at least for a period of time, the
causes in which I believe deeply,'' he said of the contemplated
Reform run. ``And that weighs upon me and it weighs upon my
conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, however, Buchanan seems ebullient as he jogs and
strategizes after a revivifying, controversy-crammed stint of 50
radio shows and 20 TV shows in the past two weeks. He rates himself
overexposed right now and wants to go off and think in time to make
his decision by the end of October. ``The thing to do now is go
down under the water, then surface at the other end of the pool,
fresh and new,'' he said with no further mention of that high
diving board.

 &HT;    BIPARTISAN HOUSE BILL WOULD PUNISH WORLD BANK FOR CONTROVERSIAL
TIBET LOAN
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bill introduced by an unusual coalition of
liberals and conservatives would restrict U.S. support for the
World Bank because of a controversial loan to help open
traditionally Tibetan lands to impoverished Chinese farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, for which the bank has tentatively approved a $40
million loan to the People's Republic of China, would re-settle
nearly 60,000 farmers from the heavily populated and eroded Qinghai
region onto a sparsely populated plateau in autonomous Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   Liberals such as Democratic Reps. John Lewis and Cynthia
McKinney of Georgia joined conservative Republicans in introducing
the bill this week to withhold U.S. funds from bank projects found
to result in harm to the environment or the rights of indigenous
peoples.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the United States and 10 other countries on
the bank's board of executive directors had opposed the loan, which
was approved in June, pending a review by an independent bank
inspection panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This plan will displace a large number of indigenous people
from their lands,'' said Lewis. ``I tend to identify with the
Tibetan people because they've been peaceful warriors for their
independence for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and McKinney joined such conservative Republicans as
Christopher Cox and Dana Rohrabacher, both of California, in
introducing the bill _ entitled the ``Ecosystems and Indigenous
Peoples Protection Act.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This project would harm the cultural and social life of the
area,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   He said ``liberals, conservatives and moderates'' had signed the
bill, which was introduced as representatives to the World Bank
gathered in Washington for the bank's annual meeting this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a message for the international financial officials
who are in Washington for these meetings,'' said Cox, a primary
sponsor of the bill. ``The World Bank must make human rights and
the environment top concerns when it is deciding to allocate its
resources.''
</P>
<P>
   The inspection panel, which operates within the bank but
independently, was to arrive in China over the weekend to begin its
review.
</P>
<P>
   Bank management was under intense and conflicting pressure when
the loan was approved. China had said it would ``re-evaluate'' its
relationship with the bank if the loan were not approved.
</P>
<P>
   The land that is to be turned over to Qinghai farmers is now
occupied primarily by Tibetan and Mongolian nomads, a bank
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, led by the International Campaign for Tibet, say these
people would be forced to give up their traditional lifestyles and
become sedentary farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Qinghai is hilly and heavily eroded and the (Chinese) people
there are unable to feed themselves. They are very eager to move,''
said Peter Stephens, a bank spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Chinese plan contains provisions that would
``protect the ethnic health'' of the Tibetan region.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the project violates the bank's own policies on
environmental impact and protection of indigenous peoples.
</P>
<P>
   The bill in Congress would require the United States to withhold
World Bank contributions equal to the amount loaned for any project
the Environmental Protection Agency or the Agency for International
Development determines violates the bank's own environmental or
social policies.
</P>
<P>
   Other authors of the bill include Reps. Dennis Kucinich and
Sherrod Brown, both Ohio Democrats; Ben Gilman, R-N.Y; John Porter,
R-Ill.; California Democrats Barbara Lee, Nancy Pelosi, Pete Stark
and Tom Lantos; Democrats Jesse Jackson Jr., Lane Evans and Luis
Guiterrez of Illinois; James McGovern, D-Mass., and Mark Udall,
D-Colo.

PEACEKEEPERS MOVE TO SECURE WESTERN REGIONS OF EAST TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, East Timor _ International forces opened what they called
a decisive phase in the campaign to secure East Timor Friday,
sending troops for the first time into the western region of the
territory, where militias that oppose them have a strong presence.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Peter Cosgrove, commander of the peacekeeping forces,
said the mission was intended to protect East Timor from threatened
attacks by armed groups that have retreated across the border into
the Indonesian region of West Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a grouping of militia who have threatened to come
into the province with the intent to cause harm,'' the general
said. ``Our notion in going into the western regencies is to
demonstrate that the mandate is clear that we must offer protection
to all East Timorese.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the peacekeeping forces, which began arriving here 12
days ago, had spent considerable time securing the capital, Dili,
from violence by militias. Now, he said, ``we also have to take
seriously the threat that they will attempt to deny the western
regencies to all those other East Timorese who live there but do
not agree with them politically.''
</P>
<P>
   The operation, involving 1,000 soldiers along with armored
vehicles, naval landing craft and Blackhawk helicopters, met no
initial resistance, said Brig. Gen. Mark Kelly, chief spokesman for
the peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a significant event within the expansion of our
operations,'' he said. Until now, the multinational force, heavily
dominated by Australians, has operated in the eastern part of the
country, where resistance has been light.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said the force, which is to grow to about 7,500 troops
from a dozen countries, numbers just over 5,000. He said the
western operation, which is intended to secure the area for food
distribution to refugees, could continue for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Cosgrove said that although the international force is mandated
to operate only within East Timor, there were circumstances under
which it could pursue aggressors or fire into West Timor if its own
security was threatened.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The militias, set up by the Indonesian military to oppose
independence for East Timor, have not so far confronted the
peacekeepers, but they continue to issue threats from their
sanctuary in West Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the militias' campaign of terror, the people of East
Timor voted on Aug. 30 to break free of Indonesia, which has
administered the territory since invading it in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   After the result of the vote was announced on Sept. 4, the
militias began a program of destruction in which most of the
territory's towns and villages have been wrecked and more than half
of its population of 800,000 people have been driven from their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said that the peacekeepers fired the first warning shots
of their mission here on Thursday, in an incident that involved
British Gurkhas escorting an aid convoy in the town of Com in the
east.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The shots were fired when the Gurkhas encountered 10 to 12
members of a militia group holding more than 2,000 people hostage,
said Lt. Col. David Richards, commander of the Gurkha unit here.
</P>
<P>
   ``They scattered and took to the hills,'' he said of the militia
members. ``In pursuit, troops fired warning shots.'' Three militia
members were detained while the rest escaped, he said. The hostages
were released and returned home.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout East Timor, militia groups have moved large numbers
of people like these from their homes and out of the territory. As
many as 200,000 people have settled _ both willingly and
unwillingly _ in West Timorese camps controlled by the militias.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of this huge forced migration remains unclear, but
the camps do offer a potential base for possible cross-border raids
by the militias and by renegade Indonesian troops who support them.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The continuing threat of attacks, both in the west and
elsewhere, has slowed the start of a huge international relief
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers said Friday that they planned their first major
distribution of food and water here in Dili at the start of next
week. They estimated that as many as 100,000 people could come down
from their mountain refuges for supplies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At six distribution points around the city, each family is to
receive one 110-pound sack of rice per month, said Rachel Stabb, a
representative of the British aid group Oxfam.
</P>
<P>
   As tens of thousands of refugees return to the capital from
their hideouts, the focus here has shifted from destruction and
threat to the immediate need for food and shelter.
</P>
<P>
   The first downpour of the rainy season Friday afternoon
heightened the urgency of finding shelter for huge numbers of
people.
</P>
<P>
   And the desperate need for food aid was underscored when
hundreds of people, lined up near the central stadium for small
handouts of rice, paid no attention to a large fire that had been
set just two blocks away at the central police station.

JAPANESE PUBLIC, TOLD RADIATION DANGER IS OVER, REMAIN SKEPTICAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHARON MOSHAVI  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ A day after a major radioactivity release from a uranium
processing plant, Japanese officials moved Friday to reassure the
public that the danger was over. But many Japanese remained
skeptical, amid accusations that the government was slow to respond
to the country's worst nuclear disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The government officially admitted Friday that an uncontrolled
nuclear reaction in Tokaimura, 70 miles northeast of Tokyo, had
spewed radioactivity for 20 hours before it was extinguished.
</P>
<P>
   The company that runs the Tokaimura plant, JCO Co., blamed the
accident on human error but came under fire for having lax safety
measures. Forty-nine people, most of them plant workers, were
poisoned, three of them critically.
</P>
<P>
   Chief government spokesman Hiromu Nonaka called the accident a
``simple, primitive mistake'' that should not affect the country's
nuclear policy. But some here wondered if Japan, the only country
ever attacked with nuclear weapons, should rethink its heavy
dependence on nuclear power. Fifty-one reactors provide a third of
Japan's electricity,
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Nuclear Safety Commission said Friday that
radiation levels were back to normal. The 300,000 people living
within a six-mile radius of the plant, who had been instructed to
stay indoors since Thursday night, were told it was safe to go
outside in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred people who had been evacuated from homes close
to the site, though, were told not to return yet.
</P>
<P>
   Many wondered whether the government was being completely
candid. They found it hard to believe that the radioactivity _
which had been 10,000 times above normal in the plant's immediate
vicinity _ had suddenly evaporated a day later. ``The government is
saying the problem has finished. But we think the radioactivity may
be continuing,'' said Mika Ohbayashi of the Citizens Nuclear
Information Center in Tokyo. ``People don't trust the government,
because they have a tendency to hide information on nuclear
incidents.''
</P>
<P>
   The center received a deluge of calls from frightened Japanese _
some living as much as a hundred miles from Tokaimura _ worried
whether it was safe to go outside.
</P>
<P>
   One scientific observer in the United States said he, too,
feared that Japanese authorities were prematurely reassuring people
that the danger had passed, when they haven't done enough study to
be sure.
</P>
<P>
   Hisham Zerriffi, project scientist at the Institute for Energy
and Environmental Research in Maryland, said he was skeptical that
radiation levels were back to normal outside the plant, since the
radiation released probably included isotopes that take much longer
than a day to disintegrate.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Japanese government, in particular, should err on
the side of caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``With certain segments of the public, they don't have the
benefit of the doubt. We already know they have in the past tried
to cover up accidents so they wouldn't look bad,'' said Zerriffi,
whose organization provides scientific analysis for environmental
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, officials conceded the government did not move quickly
enough to contain the damage and safeguard the public. The
government did not hold its first emergency meeting on the accident
until ten hours after it began.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, we must frankly admit that we were slow in
responding,'' chief government spokesman Nonaka. ``We must frankly
admit that we were too optimistic in assessing the seriousness of
the accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people in the Tokaimura area, in Ibaraki
prefecture, flocked to community centers and hospitals to have
themselves tested for radiatioactive contamination. They were urged
to bring clothing they were wearing at the time of the accident for
testing as well.
</P>
<P>
   Keiko Haginoya came with her nine-year-old daughter to be tested
and was relieved they were found to be free of contamination. But
she was still worried. ``We really don't know what it means in the
long run,'' she told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The government at first played down the severity of the accident
and did not evacuate families living within 350 yards of the site
until nearly five hours later. Instructions that thousands more
should say indoors didn't come for 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   According to officials at JCO Co., the accident started when
workers improperly mixed uranium oxide with nitric acid, part of
the process to turn uranium into nuclear fuel. They used nearly 35
pounds of uranium, seven times more than the limit designed to
avoid criticality, the point at which a nuclear fission reaction
can occur.
</P>
<P>
   The workers bypassed certain other procedures, said Makoto
Morita, spokesman for JCO. Several company executives and staff
were questioned by police on suspicion of negligence.
</P>
<P>
   The company is being sharply criticized for its lack of safety
controls. Japanese media reports said the plant did not have proper
measures to protect workers from radiation, such as glove boxes, or
automated or remote-controlled safety systems.
</P>
<P>
   When JCO Co. president Koji Kitani appeared at an evacuation
location in Tokaimura to apologize to residents, he was jeered and
called ``liar.''
</P>
<P>
   The fuel made at the Tokaimura plant is designed for Japan's
first experimental fast-breeder reactor and uses a higher
concentration of uranium than that used in conventional nuclear
power plants. Under those circumstances, analysts said, the plant
should have had especially tight controls in place.
</P>
<P>
   Also, there was little government oversight over the plant.
Ibaraki prefecture governor Masaru Hashimoto said the site had a
single bare-bones inspection in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   After 15 hours in which it was termed too dangerous for anyone
to approach the site, 16 JCO workers began efforts to bring the
nuclear reaction under control. Early Friday they removed the
coolant around the uranium, since water helps sustain nuclear
fission, and then began to inject about eight gallons of
boron-containing chemicals into the facility to shut down the chain
reaction. The boron absorbs neutrons released by uranium molecules,
which split other molecules and keep the reaction going.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese are increasingly skeptical of their country's reliance
on nuclear power. The country has had six serious mishaps at
nuclear facilities since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent was in July, when 51 tons of coolant water
leaked from the Tssuruga power station. A government poll taken
several months before that incident showed that 68 percent of
Japanese were concerned about the nation's use of nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
   The worst accident occurred in March 1997 when a fire broke out
at another reprocessing plant in Tokaimura, exposing 37 workers to
radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Public mistrust grew after that incident. Officials later
admitted that a report on the fire was altered. It also was later
disclosed that a radioactive waste storage facility had been
leaking for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, officials at a nuclear agency tried to conceal
videotape of massive coolant leak.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's nuclear safety culture is poor, says Shaun Burnie, who
as East Asia research director of Greenpeace International, spends
most of his time in Japan. ``That's because they retain an
arrogance that their nuclear technology is superior and won't go
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Also the government's desire to keep nuclear power affordable
pushes it to keep costs down with fewer inspections and safety
systems, said Burnie. ``The government is conspiring with the
nuclear industry to keep it operating,'' he said.

NEW HEWLETT-PACKARD CHIEF CRITICAL OF COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ After warning that sales growth would not be
quite as robust as Wall Street had hoped, Hewlett-Packard Co.'s new
chief executive on Friday criticized the company's ``inadequate
performance management'' and announced that employees would be
dismissed in a lagging division.
</P>
<P>
   In her first analysts' briefing since joining the company in
July as president and chief executive, Carly Fiorina said revenue
growth, previously estimated at 10 to 13 percent for the quarter
compared with a year earlier, would be closer to the low end of
that range.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard shares dropped 3 3/8, or 3.72 percent, to close
at $87 3/8 on the New York Stock Exchange. But the trading day also
concluded with drops in several other leading technology stocks,
including Microsoft Corp., Apple Computer Inc. and
Hewlett-Packard's archrival, Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Fiorina laid some blame for the anticipated slowdown
in revenue growth to a slowdown in chip production after the
earthquake in Taiwan, she also singled out Hewlett-Packard's Unix
servers division as an area in need of her attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite an absolute winning Unix server product line, our
North American sales organization continues to underperform,'' she
said. ``This is not news. It is a longstanding problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many a new chief executive, Ms. Fiorina laid the blame at
the feet of her predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view, we have operated over several years with
inadequate performance management, and we're correcting that right
now,'' Ms. Fiorina said. She announced that sales people with poor
track records were being dismissed and that the company's
compensation program was being restructured.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sales force issue is fully in our control,'' Ms. Fiorina
said. ``The earthquake in Taiwan, on the other hand, was not. And
while the situation is still somewhat fluid, we are sure of some
disruption and delay in some elements of our PC supply chain.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Hewlett-Packard is the first major U.S. technology
company to formally warn of financial repercussions from the 7.6
magnitude earthquake last week in Taiwan, analysts said the
earthquake was also likely to disrupt other major PC companies,
including Apple and Dell Computer Corp. Chip makers, including
Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., may also suffer, since
56 percent of motherboards, the circuit boards that house most PC
chips, are produced in Taiwan, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard is particularly vulnerable, however, because of
the degree to which it has shifted PC production to contract
manufacturers, many in Taiwan. Mitac International Corp., one of
Taiwan's biggest PC makers, said this week that factory shutdowns
would shave about $13 million off September sales, and
Hewlett-Packard is among its biggest customers. The use of contract
manufacturers has, however, helped Hewlett-Packard reduce costs and
improve profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   John Jones, an analyst with , described the Taiwan situation as
``not news and short-term in nature,'' and said he still expected
Hewlett-Packard to meet his earnings estimate of 81 cents per share
in the quarter. ``HP can still meet earnings expectations for a
series of reasons,'' he said. ``The PC pricing environment is
better than planned, and HP is getting better PC margins. HP is
increasing its inkjet market share, up two points in August, and
sales of very high-margin consumables are booming.''
</P>
<P>
   The weak performance in Unix servers has, by contrast, been a
problem spot for some time as Hewlett-Packard has steadily lost
market share to Sun. Although Hewlett-Packard now has a competitive
product line, and the new compensation system should help, analysts
said the company still lacked the focus Sun brings to the market.
Sun's message is that Unix is the most robust operating system and
that Sun's version of Unix, Solaris, is the most advanced.
Hewlett-Packard, on the other hand, sells both Unix servers and
machines running Microsoft's Windows NT, thus diluting its efforts,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Fiorina said the problems were in Hewlett-Packard's
business processes. ``We have had compensation systems that failed
to drive superior performance,'' she said. ``We are instituting
significant changes to improve performance in this quarter, and we
are implementing an entirely new incentive-based compensation
system, starting Nov. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Hewlett-Packard will have some special charges in
the quarter because of the spinoff of its test and measurement
business, now known as Agilent Inc. ``We also will have other
special charges to reflect some of the actions we are taking to be
more competitive as we enter the year 2000,'' Ms. Fiorina said. ``I
am not able to provide any specific numbers on that at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fiorina also said that two of Hewlett-Packard's business
unit presidents would assume new responsibilities. Ann Livermore,
who has been president of enterprise computing, will now have
primary responsibility for the company's 100 largest customers
across all business units as well as for e-services,
Hewlett-Packard's central Internet strategy. Antonio Perez, who has
been president of the hard copy business unit, will head up
Hewlett-Packard's efforts in digital imaging for both commercial
and consumer accounts.

AT THE EDUCATION SUMMIT, BROAD AGREEMENT BUT LITTLE SPECIFICITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., N.J., N.C., Mich., Calif., Colo., Texas, Wis.)  (th) 
 By JACQUES STEINBERG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALISADES, N.Y. _ Hugh B. Price, the president of the National
Urban League, recalls fuming as he left the last National
Educational Summit, held here in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The talk then was of establishing standards for what students
should know, and dealing forcefully with those who came up short,
none of which Price opposed. But whenever Price or anyone else
tried to discuss how to help those in danger of falling behind,
particularly minority children, he says such concerns were ``ruled
out of order.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so at this year's conference, which concluded here Friday,
after two days of discussion, with the release of a five-page
pledge approved by 24 governors, 34 corporate executives, 21 state
education superintendents and the presidents of the two biggest
teachers unions, among other leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The document was sprinkled with seeds of the kinds of ideas that
Price felt were lacking at the last conference. Among the new ideas
were commitments to examine salary plans that tie teacher pay to
student performance, to link professional development courses to
what teachers are actually teaching and to provide failing students
with extra help before they are held back or denied diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   Though the good intentions of policymakers are no guarantee of
good works _ many here made promises, out of earshot of their
legislatures, that were not theirs alone to keep _ all involved
said they would report back with ``specific targets and time lines
for action'' within six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very encouraged,'' Price said, ``given when you think
about where the discussion has been, even in the last year: `You've
got to end social promotion. You've got to hold students back.'
This conversation was more sophisticated than that.''
</P>
<P>
   The conversion noted by Price and others came about, in part,
out of fear. Several governors acknowledged that they had not
expected that imposing standards and high-stakes tests would set
back and stigmatize so many children.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the governors committed themselves to extending the
school day, and school year, for students identified as most at
risk of failing, and to train volunteers from colleges and local
businesses as tutors.
</P>
<P>
   Govs. Christie Whitman of New Jersey, Gray Davis of California
and James B. Hunt Jr. of North Carolina were among those who joined
business leaders in resolving to create alternatives to teacher
certification programs that would make it possible for technology
workers, among others, to more easily change careers and become
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The business leaders, among them Kurt M. Landgraf, an executive
vice president at DuPont, and John E. Pepper Jr., the chairman of
Procter &AMP; Gamble, said they would work with any interested states
to rewrite teacher salary plans ``to incorporate pay for
performance,'' an idea once strenuously opposed by teachers unions
but now, however tentatively, on the table.
</P>
<P>
   For all that it promised, the conference, which was convened by
Louis V. Gerstner Jr., the chairman of IBM, and Gov. Tommy Thompson
of Wisconsin, was hardly without its flaws.
</P>
<P>
   The final statement was often deliberately vague, offering ample
room for representatives of the bipartisan delegation to read into
it whatever they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The participants emphasized, for example, that they were for
``choice,'' especially for students wanting to attend public
schools outside their neighborhoods, but the organizers barely
touched the debate over publicly financed vouchers to private
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Though the participants' work is sure to ripple across the
country, attendance was spotty. While 41 governors came here in
March 1996, only 24 came this year. Among the noticeable no-shows
were Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who cited presidential campaign
obligations, and Gov. George Pataki of New York, who, organizers
said, had initially committed to attend but who was on a
fund-raising trip in California.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the discussions, in halls and in small committee rooms
on a wooded IBM campus here, were often conducted on a rarefied
plane, with no speeches by rank-and-file teachers or principals,
and little acknowledgment of the problems of large class sizes and
dilapidated school buildings that can undermine even the best
learning standards.
</P>
<P>
   The participants took pains to emphasize their unity, but there
were many fissures.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Feldman, the president of the American Federation of
Teachers, and Bob Chase, her counterpart at the National Education
Association, both urged caution on linking pay to performance. But
Ms. Feldman was critical of pilot programs, like the ones endorsed
by Chase in Denver, that would pay teachers based on student test
scores.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was the governors who seemed to have learned the
most. Davis, for example, said he was eager to supplement a program
that paid teachers and schools for their good work with an idea,
borrowed from Michigan, that would give scholarships to students
who make great gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very instructional for me,'' Davis said.

 &HT;    CHINA PARADES ITS NUCLEAR MISSILES THROUGH TIANANMEN SQUARE
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service (at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China put its arsenal of nuclear missiles on parade
for only the second time in its history Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The rare show of thermonuclear hardware was the crowning moment
of a day of pageantry and power in which more than 500,000
carefully chosen patriots celebrated the 50th anniversary of the
People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
   This largest display of Communist China's military brawn carried
a twofold message.
</P>
<P>
   One had a domestic audience, pumping a strong infusion of
patriotism into a population at loose ideological ends without an
anchoring set of national values. With no clear political blueprint
to follow, pride and love of motherland are pitched as the national
glue.
</P>
<P>
   The second target seemed to lie 90 miles away on Taiwan, whose
leaders have this year inched themselves to the verge of declaring
the island an independent state.
</P>
<P>
   Each major utterance from mainland China's officials over these
celebratory days has warned Taiwan of the folly of making a final
declaration of independence and expressed confidence that the
Chinese of Taipei soon will be reunited under the single rule of
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   As China's leaders watched the troops from atop the Gate of
Heavenly Peace Friday, rocket forces paraded three types of
nuclear-capable missiles through Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   The most powerful weapon on display was China's new three-stage
Dongfeng-31, a mobile solid-fueled ballistic missile capable of
landing a nuclear warhead up to 5,000 miles away in Hawaii, Alaska
or parts of the state of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Tractor-trailer trucks slowly hauled three Dongfeng-31s, each
encased in a heavy khaki-colored metal tube, past the reviewing
stands. They were the last weapons to appear in the half-hour
military parade of 11,000 troops that also featured tanks,
self-propelled cannons, Marine commandos, goose-stepping honor
guards and a fly-over by 132 warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   After successfully flight-testing the Dongfeng-31 in August,
China is expected to begin deploying 20 to 30 of the missiles next
year. Unlike previous Chinese fixed-site ICBMs, these will be
difficult to target because they are mobile.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer's report by the U.S. congressional Cox Committee
alleged that the Dongfeng-31 rocket will exploit nuclear warhead
technology stolen from the United States through espionage. But
China has issued a blanket denial.
</P>
<P>
   The two other types of nuclear rockets in the parade, the
Dongfeng-11 and Dongfeng-15, were short-range ballistic missiles.
With a 250-mile range, they are mainly capable of striking Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Beaming down on the parade from the Gate of Heavenly Peace was
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, 71, who has used the weeklong 50th
anniversary observance to consolidate his stature as China's
paramount leader.
</P>
<P>
   Six years after Jiang took over as China's head of state, a
giant poster showing his picture was carried in a national day
parade for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang had finally attained sufficient power within the ruling
Communist Party politburo to claim equal billing with communist
China's founder, the late Mao Tse-tung, and the initiator of its
market reform era, the late Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Practice has fully proved that socialism is the only way to
save and develop China,'' said Jiang, wearing a gray Mao suit as he
addressed a throng that included paratroopers, flower-waving
scientists, newlyweds in wedding clothes and a two-year-old girl in
a baby carriage chanting ``Long Live the Motherland.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese historians insist that the world's first military parade
took place in China more than 4,000 years ago, when a Chinese
chieftain named Yu gathered soldiers from tribes across China for
marching, music and songs.
</P>
<P>
   Soviet-style martial displays were an annual event in China
throughout the 1950s. But this was only the second military parade
in Tiananmen Square in the last four decades, according to the
state-run Xinhua news agency.
</P>
<P>
   The last such military parade took place in 1984, when Deng
Xiaoping was consolidating his power eight years after the death of
Chairman Mao Tse-tung. It was during the 1984 parade that China
showed off its nuclear missiles for the first time.

BUCHANAN CANCELS CHRISTIAN COALITION APPEARANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Signaling a split between Patrick J. Buchanan and
religious conservatives, Christian Coalition President Pat
Robertson warned Friday that a third-party candidacy could doom
Republican prospects in the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, for his part, canceled Saturday's scheduled appearance
at the coalition's annual convention.
</P>
<P>
   The two actions fueled speculation that Buchanan is moving
rapidly toward switching to the Reform Party. Robertson, at a news
conference, said he was surprised Buchanan would want to join such
a party, which leaves out any mention of social issues in its
platform, and questioned whether religious conservatives would
follow the former CNN commentator.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson became the latest GOP figure to voice concern that a
third-party candidacy would harm the party in the general election.
Robertson said he is convinced Bill Clinton won in 1992 and 1996
because the third-party candidacy of Ross Perot drew away votes
from the Republicans, and Robertson fears history will repeat
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said he couldn't understand Buchanan's motives,
asserting that the Reform Party is ``180 degrees out in terms of
social issues. They don't share any of the views that Pat Buchanan
claimed to espouse so vociferously.''
</P>
<P>
   The coalition leader noted the Reform Party's top elected
official, Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, said in a Playboy
magazine interview this week that organized religion is ``a sham
and a crutch for weak-minded people.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said Ventura was ``off his rocker.''
</P>
<P>
   While Robertson says he is not endorsing any candidate, he spoke
warmly about Texas Governor George W. Bush, calling him ``worthy of
support.''
</P>
<P>
   The contretemps over Buchanan occurred as five GOP candidates
addressed the opening day of the convention. The candidates pledged
in varying degrees to oppose abortion, although Bush's addressed
the issue only obliquely, saying, ``In our compassion, we should
set this goal: The born and unborn must be protected by law and
welcomed to life.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, unlike the other candidates, did not mention the word
``abortion,'' leaving that to the person who introduced him. Still,
Bush received one of the most enthusiastic receptions among the
crowd of 2,000 to 3,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two weeks, Bush has asked Buchanan not to leave the
Republican Party, noting that many believe President George Bush's
reelection bid in 1992 was doomed by Perot.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson is especially concerned about the impact of a third
party because the Christian Coalition is at its weakest financial
and political point in its 10-year history. Robertson, who said he
is ``not satisfied'' with the state of the group, recently donated
$1 million to keep afloat the coalition, which claims only 15 to 20
active state organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the coalition recently won a court ruling allowing it to
distribute its voter guides, which typically give favorable ratings
to Republicans, and Robertson said the organization will regain
strength in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be the margin of victory in the key states,''
Robertson said. ``The Christian Coalition is going to be bigger and
stronger and more powerful than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who is ardently antiabortion and usually a favorite
among the Christian Coalition membership, canceled his appearance
earlier this week, according to spokeswoman Joanne Hansen. But as
recently as Friday morning, the coalition had Buchanan listed on
Saturday's agenda. Hansen declined to explain the ``scheduling
conflict'' that caused Buchanan to cancel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a conflict,'' she said. ``I can't say what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan did not return a call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John McCain of Arizona was the only other GOP candidate
to decline an invitation to appear.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Bush, the other candidates who spoke Friday were
fomer Reagan aide Gary Bauer, former Red Cross President Elizabeth
Dole, talk show host Alan Keyes, and Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer on Wednesday held a news conference to deny having an
affair with a campaign staffer and implied the rumor was spread by
the campaign of Steve Forbes, who has denied the accusation.
Friday, Bauer took on the GOP front-runner, challenging Bush to a
debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you afraid of, governor?'' Bauer asked. Bush has
declined to appear at a town hall meeting in New Hampshire later
this month with other Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, who left the Republican
Party and is running as an independent presidential candidate, told
the audience the GOP doesn't follow its rhetoric in opposing
abortion. On that point, Smith sounded most in sync with Robertson,
who also criticized the Republican Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Directing his comments to GOP leaders, Robertson said, ``We
helped you to be elected. Now we ask for principled leadership. We
ask for courage. We ask you to remember it is better to lose
fighting a noble cause than to live in peace as a coward. In the
words of Ronald Reagan, we would say, `Paint in vivid hues, not in
pale pastels.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi, who spoke
shortly afterward, defended his leadership, saying he needs more
help from religious conservatives. Lott said electing at least four
additional Republicans to the Senate would provide enough votes to
override a presidential veto of legislation that would ban
late-term abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes is the only candidate scheduled to address the convention
Saturday. The millionaire publisher, who has sharpened his
opposition to abortion since the 1996 campaign, has hired many
former top officials of the Christian Coalition in an effort to win
over social conservatives.

   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: LAWSUITS
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Sept. 23, the House approved, 222 to 207, a bill to
move some class action lawsuits into federal courts. The bill would
give federal courts juridisction in cases where the party filing
the suit is a citizen of a different state than the defendent.
Supporters said the measure would prevent lawyers from filing cases
in states where they know they will get a ruling in their favor.
Opponents, including the White House, said the bill would make it
harder for individuals to sue companies for wrongdoing. A ``yes''
vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: ENERGY-H
</P>
<P>
   The House on Monday approved, 327 to 87, a $21.3 billion
spending bill for the Department of Energy. The bill left out $35
million requested by the department for computer security.
Supporters of the bill said the department needs to reform its
management before getting more money. Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson said he objected to the final bill's failure to
adequately address cyber security needs. A ``yes'' vote favors the
spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: PREGNANT
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday rejected, 201-224, a substitute measure
that would have increased penalties for crimes committed against
pregnant women. The bill would have replaced a measure, that later
passed, that makes it a separate federal crime to harm a fetus.
Supporters said the measure addresses the need to protect pregnant
women without compromising a woman's right to have an abortion.
Opponents said the measure failed to address the need to protect
unborn children. A ``yes'' vote favors the substitute measure.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: UNBORN
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 254 to 172, a bill that makes it
a federal crime to harm a fetus. The measure says anyone who
injures or kills a fetus in the act of another federal crime can be
punished for a separate offense on behalf of the ``unborn victim''.
Supporters said the bill properly addresses crimes against fetuses
without affecting abortion rights. But opponents said that by
recognizing a fetus parate entity, the bill is just the
first step in an attempt to eliminate a woman's right to have an
abortion. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

SUN OFFER OF SOURCE CODE LESS THAN THRILLING TO LINUX BACKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leaders of the booming Linux software movement are less than
impressed with Sun Microsystems Inc.'s plan to imitate one of the
key strategies behind Linux' growing popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Sun has announced it will publish the source code _ the raw
programming instructions _ for Solaris, Sun's version of the Unix
operating system. Solaris is one of the most popular versions of
Unix, and is run on millions of computers throughout the world.
Companies can easily pay tens of thousands of dollars to install
Solaris on their networks. But now Sun will give away the source
code to all comers. A skilled user will be able to convert the
source code into a usable version of Solaris, free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   A similar policy underlies the widespread acceptance of Linux, a
Unix-like operating system used in a growing number of businesses,
schools, and governement agencies. Many Linux users like the
software because they can modify the source code in any way they
choose, customizing their computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   The new Solaris policy will permit the same kinds of
modifications, but with a big difference. Sun will require that any
modifications to the Solaris code be shared with Sun. In addition,
users of the Solaris source code are barred from including any of
the code in software they plan to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Linux places no such restrictions on its users. Linux uses a
method called ``open source,'' which permits all users to make any
modifications they like, without having to submit them to a central
authority. And users can use Linux to build entirely new programs,
which they are then free to sell as commercial products.
</P>
<P>
   Linux specialists say Sun's offer of Solaris source code will
fizzle because Sun is maintaining such strict controls on the
software.
</P>
<P>
   ``I predict this is going to be a big yawn,'' said programmer
Eric Raymond, author of ``The Cathedral and The Bazaar,'' a widely
read analysis of the open source movement.
</P>
<P>
   In his essay, Raymond wrote that open source software tends to
improve more quickly than commercial software products. The reason,
he argued, is that with open source code, hundreds of programmers
write improvements and repair bugs, then freely share their work
with others.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond thinks Sun is trying to harness this same legion of free
programming talent to improve Solaris. But at the same time, by
requiring all modifications be submitted to Sun, the company hopes
to maintain a standardized version of Solaris and prevent the
development of many incompatible versions. ``Essentially, Sun still
controls the game,'' Raymond said.
</P>
<P>
   But Raymond believes the restrictions will merely cause
programmers to refuse to write improvements to Solaris. Instead, he
said, they'll stick with Linux, where they can do as they like.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond's views were echoed by some major Linux software firms.
Lonn Johnston, vice president of TurboLinux Inc., the leading
distributor of Linux software in Asia, said Sun is trying to have
its cake and eat it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being pregnant,'' said Johnston. ``You either are
pregnant or you aren't.'' And Melissa London, a spokeswoman for the
biggest Linux distributor, Red Hat Inc., called the Sun
announcement ``a lot of smoke and mirrors.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun officials failed to return several phone calls Friday.

HEINZE GIVEN MAJOR DEFENSE ROLE BY BURNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Steve Heinze has bounced back and forth from left wing
to right, from a boat load of ice time to a few shifts here and
there, depending on whether he's riding a hot streak or a cold one.
</P>
<P>
   With the Bruins set to open the regular season Saturday night
against Carolina at the FleetCenter, coach Pat Burns told Heinze,
who turns 30 in January, he is one of the forwards the team is
relying on to provide a steady stream of offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good discussion about it,'' said Burns. ``It's a big
year for him, he's not getting any younger. He's got to be a strong
skater. When he's down on his knees or on his belly, he's not a
strong skater. He can fire the puck with a lot of speed and if he
does that, he'll do well. (He can't) get down on himself when
things are going bad; that's been his problem the last eight or
nine years, and he has to find a way to get out of it. I think he
knows me now. He knows I'm not going to wait forever. I have to win
hockey games and that's the most important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Heinze had 22 goals and 40 points in 73 games, down
from a career-high 26 goals and 46 points in 1997-98 in just 61
contests. He will start the season with Joe Thornton at center and
Sergei Samsonov at left wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' he said. ``Those guys have a ton of offensive
skill. I think with Sammy, you've got to play a little bit
different than when Joe has the puck. When Joe has the puck, you go
straight ahead and get to the net quick. When Sammy has it, you
have to kind of time yourself and lay back a bit because he's going
to dangle and beat three guys. If I go flying to the net, I'm just
going to have some 6-foot-5-inch guy beating me up for 30 seconds
before the puck gets there. Sammy pulls guys to him so if I come in
late, I'll be going to the net with no one around me.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinze, a righthanded shot, said part of the reason he has
switched to the right side is because of opportunity. There weren't
any open left-wing spots, and he said that's fine with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time I think about it is when I'm out there, if I
have a center who's a lefty and a left wing who's a righty and just
remember who you're passing to and which side of the stick it's
going to be on,'' he said. ``It helps out on the power play if
you've got a left and a right on defense and at least one lefty or
righty to mix with others but if you don't have that, you've just
got to make do.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said part of the reason he wants Heinze to step it up is
to help absorb some of the offensive void created by Dmitri
Khristich's departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows this is a contract year for me and I'm a couple of
years away from free agency,'' said Heinze, who was married this
summer. ``I kind of slowed down in the scoring department last
year, not extensively but a touch slower than the year before. He
was saying he needs a lot from me and I have to expect a lot from
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns has adjusted his forward lines in an attempt to strike a
balance, but he said it's been difficult because of the
preponderance of righthanded shots at forward (only Thornton, P.J.
Axelsson, Mikko Eloranta and Ken Belanger are left shots), and
left-shooting defensemen. Among the top nine blue-liners, only
injured Nick Boynton and rookie Jonathan Girard are right shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most odd team I've ever had,'' said Burns.
``(Nearly) all our forwards are righthanded shots and all our
defense are lefthand shots, which makes for a power-play nightmare.
We can't have everybody playing on the left side. We already have a
right shot who's playing the left side (Dave Andreychuk). We have
Samsonov who's a right shot and plays the left side. I think
Heinzey can handle the right. All he has to do is go up and down
his wing and wait until Samsonov comes out of the corner and feeds
it to him. He has to shoot the puck and skate. If he does that,
he'll do well.''

<P>
   TOKAIMURA, Japan _ For years, Tomi Oshiro lived practically in
the shadows of this town's nuclear plant, yet she and most people
in town had little inkling of the perilous work going on inside.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery ended abruptly Thursday, when the fuel-reprocessing
plant suffered the worst nuclear accident in Japanese history. Ms.
Oshiro returned from shopping to find helicopters buzzing madly
above her house. It was several hours later before she was warned
of the full dimensions of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am furious,'' she said, adding that ``this incident was
incomparably more serious'' than previous accidents in the town,
which is the home to more than a dozen nuclear research and
production sites, including Japan's first nuclear power plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took place right next to peoples' houses,'' she said, ``and
still it took a long time before people were warned or any
emergency measures were taken.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oshiro spoke on a sidewalk less than hour after the
government declared that the danger had ended and told the 313,000
people living within a six-mile radius of the plant that they no
longer needed to stay indoors.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving her home for the first time in 24 hours, she expressed
her profound distrust of the government's handling of nuclear
safety. But in Tokyo, some 90 miles away, senior officials labored
to convey the impression of a return to normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that this should not lead to worries about the
nation's nuclear policy,'' said Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu
Nonaka, who acknowledged the government's slow handling of the
crisis but tried to allay concerns about the safety of Japan's
nuclear power industry, anxieties held both inside and outside the
country.
</P>
<P>
   But with people like the townspeople in Tokaimura, those in
civic groups around the country and independent experts in Tokyo,
government credibility had hit rock bottom, provoking cries for
everything from abandoning the nuclear industry altogether to a
sweeping overhaul of the industry, which provides nearly a third of
Japan's electrical power.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Tokaimura interviewed by phone while barricaded in
their homes, or caught on the street in the first minutes after the
ban on going outside was lifted Friday afternoon, expressed their
anger and disbelief that safety precautions could have been so lax
and that the government could have minimized the accident in the
crucial first hours.
</P>
<P>
   There was an accident two years ago that the town handled
calmly, said Kazuko Hagiya, the director of Tokai Hospital, just
two miles from the plant. ``We never realized the situation was so
serious this time,'' he said. ``I didn't close the windows right
away. Some patients didn't know anything about the accident, and
kept their windows open until they were warned, late in the
afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Yukio Hosogai, a ruddy hospital refrigerator technician who was
walking his dog, Hayato, said he learned of the accident in a call
from his wife around noon, but was surprised to see civilian cars
driving through the area two hours later.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, walking in an abandoned roadway, dozens of
white-suited nuclear clean-up workers combed the rice fields
nearby, using Geiger counters to measure radiation levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly speaking, I will never get rid of the anxieties that
come from living here,'' he said, ``and if I could get rid of
everything today and move somewhere else, I would. But I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Tokaimura once thought that the town of about
33,000 inhabitants had been lucky to become the home of Japan's
nuclear industry, beginning in the 1950s. Before that, it had been
a poor pearl in a string of what the Japanese call company castle
towns, meaning towns dominated by a single corporation, in this
case Hitachi.
</P>
<P>
   First came the country's first nuclear lab, then its first
reactor, then its first nuclear fuel-processing plants, and
finally, its first breeder reactor, which uses plutonium rather
than the uranium fuel and is theoretically self-sustaining.
</P>
<P>
   Little by little, residents in this coastal area _ with deep
green rice fields, peaked tile-roofed houses and the country's
characteristic commercial sprawl _ began to realize the costs
associated with the new industry.
</P>
<P>
   This realization exploded into the public consciousness here and
throughout Japan in 1995 with a huge leak of radioactive coolant at
the breeder plant in Tokaimura and again two years later with a
fire at another fuel-reprocessing plant here that exposed 37
workers to radiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few of us tried to sound the alarms of danger from this
industry starting way back,'' said Osamu Yatabe, a lawyer who once
represented the district in the National Assembly. ``We were always
in the minority though, because officials were able to convince
people that accidents like Chernobyl and Three Mile Island could
never happen here. Japan's safety precautions were in fact perfect,
they said.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tokyo on Friday, independent nuclear experts and civic groups
ridiculed the government's contention that the uncontrolled
reaction, in a privately owned uranium-reprocessing plant, did not
reflect on the overall safety of Japan's huge nuclear energy
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Even one senior official, International Trade and Industry
Minister Kaoru Yosano, took exception to the prevailing official
line, saying he was more concerned about ``psychological damage''
to the public than any economic impact. ``I am worried that the
unthinkable critical accident may throw cold water on the public
trust in nuclear facilities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One the most critical stances, though, came from Greenpeace
Japan, which said it was starting a campaign to force the
government to phase out the nuclear industry.
</P>
<P>
   Others may have stopped short of a demand like that, which has
little prospect of being realized, but insisted on sweeping changes
and were no less scathing in their dismissal of government
explanations of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about such reassurances by the government, Kiyoshi
Sakurai, a former researcher at the state-run Atomic Energy
Research Institute said: ``Nonsense. Safety management or
operational management of other nuclear facilities has a lot in
common with this plant _ that is, the system is designed in ways
that allow workers to intervene easily in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   According to most accounts of the accident, a flash of blue
light and a critical chain reaction of nuclear fission were
produced when workers inside the plant put five times the amount of
uranium in an acid solution-filled processing container than is
normally allowed. Three of those workers are among the critically
injured, altogether 49 people were exposed to radiation.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction was eventually contained when emergency workers
managed to break a drainage pipe for the container holding the
fissionable material. Later, emergency crews douses the
contaminated site with radiation-absorbing chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many in the public say that this accident must have been
caused by a procedural infractions, but I do not buy that,'' said
Keiji Koyabashi, a scientist at the Research Reactor Institute of
Kyoto University.
</P>
<P>
   ``In nuclear power matters, there should always be fail-safes,''
he said. ``Even if a mistake occurs, safety must be assured.''

CELTICS OWNER FOREGOES $1 MILLION SALARY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON _ Celtics owner Paul Gaston declined his $1 million
salary for the fiscal year that ended June 30 after a tough
financial season for the franchise, due to the NBA owners' lockout
of players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a personal decision, he felt it was the right thing to
do because of the lockout,'' said Celtics' executive vice-president
Richard Pond.
</P>
<P>
   There is precedent for the move. NBA Commissioner David Stern
declined to collect his salary for the period of the lockout, which
lasted until Jan. 20 and erased 32 games of the Celtic's 82-game
season.
</P>
<P>
   The lockout began July 1, 1998 and had a substantial negative
impact on the Celtics' bottom line. Revenue for the fiscal year
ending June 30 was $43 million compared to $75.7 million in the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Celtics LP, the ownership group for the
publicly-trade franchise, last month reported a loss of $10.1
million. The team told the Securities and Exchange Commission that
it lost $950,000 in ticket revenue and $115,000 in broadcast fees
per game.
</P>
<P>
   Gaston would make no public comment on his decision to forego
his salary, which was first reported by Street &AMP; Smith's
SportsBusiness Journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just talked to him and he said, `I don't even know what all
of the fuss is about.' '' Pond said. ``He basically told me answer
the questions, but he doesn't see it as a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The questions I've gotten is was he forced to do it?
Absolutely not, this was completely a decision that he made,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pond denied that Gaston's move or the poor economic performance
of the team last year suggested that the franchise is financially
troubled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' Pond said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gaston family, including Paul's father Don, who passed
control of the team to his son, has other, considerable business
ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``His family I am sure has all kinds of other investments,''
Pond said. `I don't even know them all. But I am certain from some
of those other ventures that he derives income.''

INVESTING WITH SUSAN M. BYRNE: GABELLI WESTWOOD EQUITY FUND  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 3) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, Okla.)  (ART ADV: Graphic of Gabelli Westwood Equity fund is being sent to
NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase
by calling (888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Wall Street, there is money to be made running with the herd
_ or against it. Susan M. Byrne, portfolio manager of the $194.1
million Gabelli Westwood Equity fund, takes the second approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look for stocks where I see that improvements in a company's
growth prospects are going unrecognized by Wall Street, either in
consensus earnings or forward growth rates,'' she said from her
office in downtown Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Bucking the crowd has paid off. The fund returned 19.8 percent
for the 12 months ended Sept. 30, compared with 15.7 percent for
its peers in the large value category, according to Morningstar
Inc., the Chicago financial publisher, and 21.4 percent for the
Standard &AMP; Poor's Barra Value Index of large-capitalization value
stocks, with dividends reinvested monthly.
</P>
<P>
   It returned 18.1 percent a year, on average, for the three years
through Sept. 30, versus 15.4 percent for its peers, according to
Morningstar, and 19 percent for the S&AMP;P Barra Value Index.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing stocks, Ms. Byrne, 53, makes use of what she calls
``a proxy for professional skepticism'': She starts with the
percentage by which a company beats analysts' consensus earnings
estimates for a quarter and compares that number with the
percentage increase in earnings that analysts forecast for that
year. A ratio higher than 1 suggests that analysts may not be
giving enough credence to the company's improving fundamentals. (In
the fourth quarter, she will look at the next year's earnings
forecast.)
</P>
<P>
   ``When analysts don't revise earnings upward after a company
beats its estimate,'' she said, ``it means that they don't believe
that the company can do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   That situation, she added, creates opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Byrne looks at a company's price-to-sales ratio, but pays
relatively scant attention to its price-to-earnings multiple when
buying. ``When you have a large company that is in a period of
turning around its business, its income statement could mean
anything,'' she said. ``The balance sheet is the real story.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, Ms. Byrne likes to see companies with debt-to-total
capitalization ratios of less than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   She steers clear of companies with price-to-sales ratios
exceeding the average of roughly 4 for the S&AMP;P 500. That eliminates
most Internet, software and early-stage growth companies, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, she also demands an improving return on shareholder
equity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I combine that with a showing of stable to lower debt,'' she
said, ``which tells me that the improvement is coming from company
operations, not financial leverage.'' (A rising return on equity,
of course, can be a result of increasing debt.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Byrne, who works with three analysts on the fund, said she
tends to sell stocks when their price-to-earnings multiples rise
above their corresponding earnings growth rates _ when the P/E
climbs to 31, for example, and the earnings growth rate is 30
percent or less.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Byrne likes the Devon Energy Corp., an Oklahoma City-based
oil and gas company. In August, Devon bought Pennzenergy, formerly
Pennzoil, based in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The natural-gas companies are coming through with tremendous
positive earnings surprises and no earnings revisions,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gas prices have been strong this year and oil prices have risen
sharply, she noted. ``We did our work on Devon,'' she said, ``and
kept getting multiples and cash flow estimates that were
significantly higher than other people's.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund began buying shares in January at an average cost of
$30. Ms. Byrne forecasts earnings growth of 30 percent a year, on
average, over three years, and has a 12-month price target of $60 a
share. The stock closed on Friday at $41.625.
</P>
<P>
   She bought shares in the Walt Disney Co. in late summer at an
average cost of $27, after the company announced that it would sell
its Fairchild magazine division and its two hockey teams. The
company posted a positive earnings surprise in the second quarter,
beating analysts' estimates of 19 cents a share by a penny.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts, worried about deteriorating attendance at Disney's
Florida operations and lackluster video sales, revised their annual
earnings estimates downward by 5 cents a share, to 67 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we'll see an improvement in Disney's focus,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She forecasts an annual three-year growth rate in earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of 18 percent
to 20 percent, and has a 12-month price target in the mid-$40s. The
stock closed on Friday at $25.325.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Ms. Byrne bought shares in Federated Department Stores
at an average cost of $46. Federated, which owns chains like
Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Lazarus, acquired Fingerhut, a catalogue
retailer of lower-priced novelties, in late March, she said,
because of its expertise in order fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that a year from now, when people look back at the
Internet, they will realize that it's a lot easier to create a Web
page than it is to get an order out to a consumer at the right time
and get paid,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter, Federated posted earnings of 61 cents a
share, beating analysts' consensus estimate of 50 cents. But
analysts did not revise their annual earnings estimates upward, she
said, because ``they're concerned that consumers will stop buying
because of the rise in interest rates.''
</P>
<P>
   She estimated that Federated's earnings would grow 20 percent a
year, on average, over three years. Her 12-month price target for
the stock is $85; it closed on Friday at $44.8125.

EATON GLAD TO HAVE WOHLABAUGH ON THE LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ There's a good chance Dave Wohlabaugh wasn't
shaking in his boots in Cleveland this week, but he probably got a
good laugh from the series of phone messages from Chad Eaton.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a friendly battle of interior linemen Sunday between
Eaton, Wohlabaugh, the Browns' center. The two battled on the
practice field for two years before Wohlabaugh jumped ship and
signed a lucrative seven-year, $26.5 million deal with Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be fun,'' said Eaton. ``Dave's a friend, but it was fun
just trying to get him going. I was going to leave him phone
messages every so often just to get him going. I just wanted him to
know that I'm going to be in front of him all day. I want him to
know I'll be there.''
</P>
<P>
   One time Wohlabaugh called back and left a message saying, ``Why
are you stalking me? Leave me alone. No, just kidding, call you
later.''
</P>
<P>
   Another time Eaton left a song he heard on the radio on the
message machine. Eaton said he would probably leave another message
or two by the end of business Friday, but then he would leave
Wohlabaugh alone.
</P>
<P>
   Other Patriots, including Max Lane, also have been in touch with
Wohlabaugh this week.
</P>
<P>
   Concidentally, Eaton left Cleveland to come to New England. He
often tells the story of being in the Browns' locker room when
owner Art Modell told the team it was moving to Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Wohlabaugh has been the steady hand on the Browns' offensive
line this season, working with No. 1 pick Tim Couch, just as he had
to work with Drew Bledsoe, though Bledsoe was in his third year
when Wohlabaugh was drafted in '95 out of Syracuse. He was a very
effective player for the Patriots and he wanted to remain with the
team, but a contract offer never came. When the Patriots finally
got into it, their offer couldn't touch the Browns' deal, which
made Wohlabaugh the highest-paid center in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots then opted for Boston College's Damien Woody with
their first round pick.
</P>
<P>
   And Eaton had a new center to torment.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton will certainly be motivated by two factors Sunday: his
matchup against Wohlabaugh and returning to Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wondered what it would be like to play against Dave
in a game,'' said Eaton. ``He was a great guy to battle with in
practice, because the centers I'd face in the games couldn't match
up against Dave. We all hated to see him go because he meant a lot
to this team, but now he's on the enemy side and we have to battle
him and make sure he doesn't get the best of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Pete Carroll has gotten into the ``matchup'' saying earlier
this week, ``We'd like to see Chad whip him, but I know Dave's
going to do everything he can to keep that from happening. We'll
keep close watch on the film and see if Chad gets him.''
</P>
<P>
   If he doesn't?
</P>
<P>
   Eaton will have to swallow a few of his words.
</P>
<P>
   But this kind of friendly matchup has been missing in the NFL
for many years now. It seems that teams are afraid to exchange
barbs for fear of ``locker room material'' that might incite the
other team.
</P>
<P>
   Some players fear that, but Eaton feels confident enough in his
ability to have some fun in pure WWF style, while understanding the
matchup is vital to the success of the Patriots, who must not only
get to Couch and pressure him, but also stop the Browns' running
game.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton is also very serious about the Cleveland game, echoing
Carroll's words that this could very well be a ``trap'' game _ in
which the Patriots get overconfident.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the games that you need to worry about,'' said
Eaton. ``They have some good players and we have to play against
those good players. It's not an easy game and I'm not going to go
into it that way. I know more than anyone the guy I'm facing is a
good player. I know because I've faced him a lot. It'll be
interesting to see what I can exploit against Dave and what he can
exploit against me.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Patriots don't want to do is get into a close game and
have the ``Dawg Pound'' involved. Eaton recalls the home-field
advantage those fans used to give the Browns. The stadium may be
new and the team different, but dawgs will be dawgs.

`THREE KINGS' DAZZLES WITH A SURREAL BREW OF HUMOR AND HORRORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Three Kings'' _ an action/comedy/melodrama set during the last
days of Operation Desert Storm in 1991 _ is the movie Oliver Stone
has been trying to make his entire career. It's a pi$ata of a
picture, filled with ideas, exhilarating filmmaking technique and a
robust (even off-putting) bleak humor. ``Kings'' mostly uses
contradictions to set a questioning, roughhouse tone, both in its
storytelling and in its use of popular culture _ the movie careens
from one irony to another like a master player's pinball, scoring
at will.
</P>
<P>
   The story follows four American soldiers who happen upon a map
that leads to Iraqi gold, treasure that the men plan on liberating
for themselves. As they make the trek, they discover that the heist
will end up being as complicated as the war itself. Nothing is
simple.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing except the film's action sequences, which come together
with ruthless clarity. Writer/director David O. Russell employs
moviemaking skills and fervor that, based on his modestly staged
but thoughtful screwball comedies, ``Spanking the Monkey'' and
``Flirting With Disaster,'' he seemed incapable of. The story is
told with a variety of camera tricks and hand-held moves that give
the film a journalistic immediacy. Russell also uses the bravura
mechanics of action moviemaking to impart an element of swiftness.
He never lingers on anything for too long. It's a pulse-pounding
style that makes ``Three Kings'' feel like Jean-Luc Godard's ``Les
Carabiniers'' _ a legendary anti-war film about a pair of kids who
go off to war to loot and arouse themselves from boredom _ but as
handled by the Bomb Squad, the sonic masterminds who produced the
dizzying assault of rappers Public Enemy. (One of their songs,
``Can't Do Nuttin' for Ya, Man,'' which includes the line that
could sum up the characters' plight _ ``You jumped out of the jelly
into a jam'' _ is used on the ``Three Kings'' soundtrack.)
</P>
<P>
   The men out to recover the gold are Archie (George Clooney), a
Special Forces veteran whose brow is twisted into a permanent
furrow, and the Army reservists Troy (Mark Wahlberg), who tries to
do what's decent whenever he can, his buddy Vig (Spike Jonze), an
eager but brainless redneck who'd rather shoot or fight, and the
resourceful Chief (Ice Cube). It's Troy who sets into motion the
moral questioning when, in the first scene in the picture, he asks
``Are we still shooting people?'' and blasts a man who may have
been trying to surrender ... or trying to kill him, we're never
sure. Wahlberg's light, raspy voice _ how was this guy ever pop
star Marky Mark? _ gives him a querulous quality. He seems to
always be wondering how people are feeling, which doesn't mesh with
the ``collateral damage'' of the Persian Gulf War, where the
killing techniques far surpassed any of the soldiers' abilities to
figure out what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   When this quartet proceeds with their free-enterprise mission,
they get to see, up close, the calamities they've only caught on
TV. Despite the apparent U.S. victory, and the cease-fire, Saddam
Hussein's army is still beating and torturing Kuwaitis. It doesn't
make any sense to the young reservists, who are itching for a
fight. (''We didn't see any action,'' they tell Archie, which leads
to a hilarious scene involving a cluster bomb and a wandering cow.)
When Archie decides to take an active stance, ``Three Kings''
hurtles into a faster mode.
</P>
<P>
   Clooney is used for his commonsense star quality. He's a brooder
with a Heathcliff aspect and a patient, deliberate way of speaking
that masks an undercurrent of anger; until he explodes, he seems to
be the sanest and most beleaguered of men. This may not be his best
performance, but he shows why he's a star; he steps up and takes
command. He's also a generous actor, and an ambitious one who makes
interesting choices. Neither ``Three Kings'' _ which he is said to
have campaigned for _ nor Clooney's previous film, ``Out of
Sight,'' are the picks of a complacent actor. Clooney doesn't
overshadow any of his co-stars. And Spike Jonze, the talented young
music-video director who lives to perpetrate pop-culture scams,
shines as Vig, the comic relief who always says the wrong thing.
Nora Dunn is a Christiane Amanpour-ish reporter who's angry over
the Army's stonewalling of the media. It points the press toward
only the news it wants broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three Kings'' shows an unblinking willingness to exhibit the
real results of action-picture violence. A flash-cut to a body's
interior _ Wahlberg's _ shows the damage a bullet can do. ``Three
Kings'' treads a dangerous line between wanting to have its cake
and eat it, too. You can't help but be excited by the bravado and
precision of the action the movie is trying to comment on, tinged
with its drab khaki and olive palette. When a woman is executed,
we're almost catapulted out of the movie, even as ``Three Kings''
tries to depict the casual cruelty of war.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the movie seems so hungry to express ideas that it
feels pitiless. After Troy has been captured _ following a funny
digression by his captor on race oppression and Michael Jackson _
he has an eye-opening political discussion in which he strains to
convince the Iraqis (who have been pressed into service, like Troy,
for the extra money, and don't really believe in Saddam) why the
United States is involved. Here, a point is made too crudely about
the real basis for the gulf war. Troy's captors shove oil down his
throat to teach him what the West is really fighting for.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the ironies in ``Three Kings'' come more quickly and
smoothly. When Ice Cube bursts into a bunker filled with Iraqis,
and their Western booty _ computers, VCRs and TVs _ the camera
whips around to show Rodney King being beaten by police officers to
raise the question, What is this black man fighting for? On an even
subtler front _ and in maybe one of the funniest scenes of the
decade: Cube and Jonze, once two of the most subversive figures in
popular culture, argue over which music is more suitable for
listening, Chicago or Judas Priest. And this before they're about
to drive a fleet of luxury cars across the desert to save their
captured buddy. When the contrasts pile up this fast, you know
you're seeing something unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three Kings'' is so smart and nimble, making references
ranging from ``Star Wars'' to ``The Stunt Man'' to the media
establishment, that it comes off as a little cold, not affecting
when it could be. But that's meant as a compliment _ there's
nothing else out there remotely like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three Kings'' is rated R for profanity, violence, gore and
brief sexuality. .MDNM/ (lvis Mitchell is a film critic for the

   RAMPUR, India _ Maneka Gandhi is the other daughter-in-law, the
one who did not inherit the dynasty. And oh, how the irony grates
on her.
</P>
<P>
   After all, she is the one born in India, Sonia Gandhi in Italy.
She has been in politics for 20 years, Sonia for two. She is the
widow of Sanjay, the anointed son who was a natural wielder of
power and his mother's right-hand man. Sonia's husband was Rajiv,
an airline pilot, mild in disposition, disinclined to the hard
knocks of governance.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the irony. ``That's what's known as life,'' said Maneka,
who is used to pondering fate's unwanted intrusions. ``I was going
along smoothly and then life got in the way.''
</P>
<P>
   One day recently, life _ that meddlesome conniver _ was again up
to no good.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, both of the estranged daughters-in-law had come
to politic in Rampur, a small city 120 miles east of New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   Sonia, leader of the venerable Congress Party, arrived in a
helicopter, which alighted in a pasture where 40,000 wildly
cheering people awaited her.
</P>
<P>
   Maneka, the cabinet minister for welfare in the national
government, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party, came by car over
tedious, pot-holed roads. She then spoke before a modest and
restrained crowd of 1,000 at a street corner rally beside a mosque,
a shoe store and a beauty parlor.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Maneka did not want to be here at all. India is
finishing five weeks of voting on Oct. 3. A political independent,
running for her fourth term in Parliament, she was merely helping
out a party ally from another district. Nationwide, the party seems
to doing quite well, though this was not the case in Rampur.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few hours after reaching town, Maneka concluded that this
race was a lost cause. Moreover, the local politicos struck her as
so many dolts; she was furious at them. Before her speech, they had
left her to wait in a shabby, ill-lighted hotel room. And it was
there, in an interview, that she opened the steam valve to what is
a notorious temper.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people have no idea what they are doing,'' she
complained. ``They sit with their feet up, studying polls and
picking their toes. I am wasting my time here. These fools did not
announce me properly and now they tell me they are expecting 500 to
1,000 people. Ugh! I can draw 5,000 in one of my little villages.
Now they're saying the crowd will be smaller because Sonia was here
today. Sonia! Sonia! Sonia is no excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Sonia, with whom she talks no more. Sonia, who has also survived
the dynasty's epidemic of tragedy. Sonia, the aloof woman who now
wants to run the country.
</P>
<P>
   From 1974 to 1982, the two daughters-in-law lived under the same
famous roof. ``They hated each other's guts from the word go,''
said the writer Khushwant Singh, who was a family friend. ``Their
husbands didn't like each other either.''
</P>
<P>
   The head of the household was Indira Gandhi, then the prime
minister, a woman with a tempestuous political career, alternately
loved and loathed by the masses.
</P>
<P>
   A traditional Indian mother-in-law, she expected quiet deference
from her sons' wives. Sonia, raised in a conservative Roman
Catholic family near Turin, was appropriately dutiful, building a
life around her husband and their two children. She would often
cook her mother-in-law a soothing plate of pasta after a hectic
day.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Maneka, daughter of a Sikh army colonel, was brash
and opinionated. Once a petite model and an aspiring journalist,
she was less inclined to wrap herself in elegant saris and far more
eager to poke her nose into the family business: politics.
</P>
<P>
   Sonia, now 52, may have been a rival for her mother-in-law's
affection, but Maneka, 43, never considered her an equal as a
thinker. ``Take it from me, there's nothing upstairs except
cooking,'' she said of her sister-in-law, breaking into a naughty
giggle.
</P>
<P>
   When the titters subsided, Maneka said she regretted sounding so
``nasty,'' but then she proceeded to get nastier. She likened Sonia
to a Barbie Doll and complained that the Congress Party hierarchy
had chosen her as their leader because she is ``totally nondoing
and harmless and somebody who won't get in the way of their own
individual ambitions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They think any Gandhi can win for them,'' Maneka said, going
on to explain why she could never be that Gandhi: ``I am much too
independent a person and much too serious about what I do to be of
value as leadership material to the Congress Party.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gandhi name holds a regal sort of magic in India _ a tug at
the heart strings if not always a lure to the ballot box. Indeed,
during this election, one of the biggest stories has been the
emergence of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Sonia's 27-year-old daughter.
She has been stumping for her mother, and the crowds adore her.
Thousands wait along the sun-parched roads for a glimpse. News
accounts have her ``casting a spell'' wherever she goes, with her
eventual rise to prime minister ``a political inevitability waiting
to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Gandhis' mystique is in sheer soap-operatic appeal.
Their saga is hard to top, what with the birth of a nation, three
wars, two assassinations and one fatal plane crash. Pages in
India's 52-year history pile up like leaves beneath the family
tree.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, the dynasty bears no blood kinship to the most
famous Gandhi of all, Mohandas K., better known as the Mahatma.
Rather, its progenitor is Jawaharlal Nehru, the moody and dynamic
man who was India's prime minister during its first 17 years.
Nehru's only child, Indira, married Feroze Gandhi, the son of a
shopkeeper, who brought to his bride a politically useful surname
if no distinguished pedigree.
</P>
<P>
   Indira, once thought to be a malleable political figurehead,
turned out to be both reliably bright and occasionally ruthless.
She dominated Indian politics for nearly two decades.
</P>
<P>
   At her side was her younger son, Sanjay, who, while not a
tenacious student of self-knowledge, was a formidable political
enforcer. He was Indira's acknowledged political heir, but his
destiny turned fickle among the clouds on June 23, 1980. That
morning, as he pursued the risky hobby of stunt flying, his plane
failed to pull out of a dive.
</P>
<P>
   At age 23, Maneka was a widow with a 3-month-old son. Grief did
not bring her and Indira closer. ``Maneka was totally neglected,
and Rajiv and Sonia came to the center stage as Mrs. G.'s closest
confidantes,'' said Singh, the writer. ``Mrs. G. actually went out
of her way to belittle the girl. With Maneka in the room, she'd
give Sonia something of her father's _ a watch or a pen _ and say,
`I want only you to have this.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Whatever went on between the young widow and her powerful
mother-in-law is undoubtedly a convolution of mutual hurts. Maneka
wanted to establish her own political career, and by most accounts,
Indira suspected disloyalty. In March 1982, she ordered Maneka out
of the house. Maneka, who had anticipated the eviction, made sure
the press was there to cover her forced departure.
</P>
<P>
   Both women went public with invective. At one point, Indira
vilified Maneka for her rudeness, snidely adding that the family
had accepted her even though she was from ``a different
background.'' To some, this has always seemed a slam at Maneka for
not being of the Brahman caste _ and regrettable proof that Sonia,
a white European girl from a middle-class family, rated higher on
Indira's measure of social status.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 31, 1984, Indira was murdered by her security guards.
Sonia sat beside the bullet-ridden body on the trip to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   That same day Rajiv Gandhi _ the reticent son who had preferred
to stay out of politics _ was sworn in as prime minister. Sonia,
fearing for her husband's life, had begged him not to accept. Her
trepidation was warranted. He too was assassinated, in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress Party, so long dependent on the dynasty, suddenly
found itself out of Gandhis. Sonia declined to get involved.
Maneka, the renegade, had drifted further astray: She now had her
own political identity as a champion of the environment and an
animal rights advocate. And she had already served in the Cabinet
of an opposition government.
</P>
<P>
   Through the 1990s, the Congress Party has had its ups and downs.
During one descent, in 1998, things seemed to be in free fall.
Beseeched repeatedly, Sonia finally agreed to campaign for the
party, and later the hesitant widow became its president.
</P>
<P>
   Her primary opponent is the incumbent, the Hindu nationalist
Bharatiya Janata Party, whose candidates often stress Sonia's
foreign birth. Some of it is simple mockery. One leaflet wrongly
claims that she forced Rajiv to convert to Christianity and change
his name to Roberto.
</P>
<P>
   As a campaigner, Sonia is much improved from a year ago, reading
her Hindi speeches with barely a hint of an Italian accent. Still,
with polls showing Congress behind, many party workers are ready
for ``The Gandhis: The Next Generation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing _ or appalling _ how so many around here believe
Priyanka can revive the party,'' said one Congress official,
speaking on the condition of anonymity. ``It's clear that we're a
family concern, and the leadership will pass from Sonia to
Priyanka, and she will be more acceptable to the Indian public
because she is more Indian.''
</P>
<P>
   All three members of the dynasty's younger generation have been
out on the hustings. Besides Priyanka there is her brother Rahul,
29, a securities broker who lives in London, and Feroze Varun, a
19-year-old student who is Maneka's son.
</P>
<P>
   None of these up-and-coming Gandhis have declared an interest in
public office. In fact Priyanka, a former kindergarten teacher who
is married to a jewelry exporter, said she is decidedly cynical
about politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was just dealing with people and getting the work done,
that would be fine,'' she said. ``But the manipulation process _ I
can do without it.''
</P>
<P>
   Restraint is one of Priyanka's traits. In an interview, she
would not excoriate Maneka, saying that people are entitled to
their own opinions, no matter how unflattering, and that ``my aunt
ceased to be my aunt in 1981.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She obviously has a lot of anger inside her,'' Priyanka added.
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign goes on, Priyanka is repeatedly likened in
appearance and mannerisms to her grandmother Indira. In her
professed aversion to the family business, she is more like her
mother.
</P>
<P>
   Only Maneka seems at ease in the fray. She finds the fuss made
over Priyanka's future as ludicrous as the idea of the wrong
daughter-in-law ending up atop the dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   Life, forever haywire, seems to be getting in the way again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Priyanka, that's another one!'' Maneka said acidly. ``Here's
someone who has made no particular contribution to anything.''
</P>
<P>
   She paused to harrumph, then finished her thought, ``And now
they want this little child to take over.''

U.S. ISSUES SOME GUIDELINES ON FORMING JOINT VENTURES 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department and the Federal Trade
Commission published proposed guidelines Friday for joint ventures
among businesses, indicating the sorts of agreements that do not
violate federal antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Joint ventures or collaborations in purchasing, marketing,
patent licensing or research are growing more common, but the legal
standards showing when cooperation is permissible, and when it
might violate antitrust laws, are murky and confusing.
</P>
<P>
   The two agencies, in a summary accompanying the guidelines,
said, ``Competitive forces of globalization and technology are
driving firms toward complex collaborations to achieve goals such
as expanding into foreign markets, funding expensive innovation
efforts and lowering production and other costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pitofsky, chairman of the Trade Commission, said: ``What
we have strived for is a uniform standard. It's the first effort in
this country to have guidelines that cut across all joint ventures
_ research and development, marketing, patent, cross-licensing,
production.''
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines are merely proposals. They are now subject to
comment for 90 days, after which time the agencies will decide
whether to modify or approve them.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-page guide sets out the tests the two agencies will apply
in determining whether to investigate or challenge a proposed joint
venture. They do not definitively establish which ventures are
legal and which are not, noting that each case has unique
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   But, in general, they do say that ``agreements among
competitors'' to ``share or divide markets by allocating customers,
suppliers, territories or lines of commerce'' are automatically
considered illegal and will be challenged. An alleged proposed
agreement of that sort is at the center of the Justice Department's
antitrust suit against Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But when two companies in an otherwise competitive industry
choose to cooperate in a way that does not significantly alter the
competitive landscape, the likelihood is that the joint venture
would be permitted, the guidelines say. One indication that a
problem might exist is if the two companies, combined, hold more
than 20 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky said the genesis of the guidelines came from hearings
the agency held on high-tech competition two years ago. At the end,
the commissioners asked the witnesses ``what area of law we should
turn to to assist global and high-tech competition by clarifying
the law, and we were blown away by the unanimity of responses,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The witnesses said they wanted more clarity on joint ventures
and antitrust because ``American joint venture law is unclear,
murky, uncertain,'' Pitofsky said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Often, the trade commission will approve a cooperative agreement
in part but make certain stipulations, just as is true in many
merger cases. For example, the commission approved a significant
joint venture between Shell and Texaco last year after the venture
agreed to sell a refinery and divest itself of some retailing
operations in Hawaii and California, eliminating areas where the
commission believed the two companies, together, would hold too
much market power.
</P>
<P>
   At other times, the commission tries to block cooperation when
one company's arrangement with another causes what the
commissioners see as anti-competitive harm.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, seven months ago the commission charged Mylan
Laboratories, one of the world's largest makers of generic drugs,
with violating antitrust law by entering into illegal agreements
with one of its suppliers to eliminate competition in the market
for two generic drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked on these guidelines to give certainty to the
parties,'' Pitofsky said. ``There are no absolute bright lines. But
at least if you know the progression, we'll all be on the same
page.''

<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: ENERGY-S
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday approved, 96 to 3, a $21.3 billion
spending bill for the Department of Energy. The bill left out $35
million requested by the department for computer security.
Supporters of the bill said the department needs to reform its
management before getting more money. Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson said he objected to the final bill's failure to
adequately address the cyber security needs. A ``yes'' vote favors
the spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: BUDGET
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday approved, 98 to 1, a temporary spending
measure that will keep the federal government open until Oct. 21.
The bill gives lawmakers time to resolve several problems
surrounding the annual spending bills, some of which President
Clinton has threatened to veto. Clinton has signed the resolution
into law. A ``yes'' vote favors the measure.

   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: LAWSUITS
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Sept. 23, the House approved, 222 to 207, a bill to
move some class action lawsuits into federal courts. The bill would
give federal courts juridisction in cases where the party filing
the suit is a citizen of a different state than the defendent.
Supporters said the measure would prevent lawyers from filing cases
in states where they know they will get a ruling in their favor.
Opponents, including the White House, said the bill would make it
harder for individuals to sue companies for wrongdoing. A ``yes''
vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: ENERGY-H
</P>
<P>
   The House on Monday approved, 327 to 87, a $21.3 billion
spending bill for the Department of Energy. The bill left out $35
million requested by the department for computer security.
Supporters of the bill said the department needs to reform its
management before getting more money. Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson said he objected to the final bill's failure to
adequately address cyber security needs. A ``yes'' vote favors the
spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: PREGNANT
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday rejected, 201-224, a substitute measure
that would have increased penalties for crimes committed against
pregnant women. The bill would have replaced a measure, that later
passed, that makes it a separate federal crime to harm a fetus.
Supporters said the measure addresses the need to protect pregnant
women without compromising a woman's right to have an abortion.
Opponents said the measure failed to address the need to protect
unborn children. A ``yes'' vote favors the substitute measure.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: UNBORN
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 254 to 172, a bill that makes it
a federal crime to harm a fetus. The measure says anyone who
injures or kills a fetus in the act of another federal crime can be
punished for a separate offense on behalf of the ``unborn victim''.
Supporters said the bill properly addresses crimes against fetuses
without affecting abortion rights. But opponents said that by
recognizing a fetus as a separate entity, the bill is just the
first step in an attempt to eliminate a woman's right to have an
abortion. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

protection last week, its chief executive, William Dragon Jr., had
a culprit: his own stores.
</P>
<P>
   In its heyday, London Fog was perhaps the best-known
manufacturer of rainwear and outerwear in the country. Its products
were sold mainly through upscale third parties, like department
stores.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, however, London Fog went directly into
retail in a big way. Not only did the company roll out a national
chain of 140 stores, it also experimented with both small- and
large-store formats and with sites as disparate as urban centers,
suburban malls and airports.
</P>
<P>
   Dragon said the strategy was a mistake, in large part because it
alienated the brand's most loyal customers _ the department stores.
``Previous strategy was to compete in the direct retail sector,''
Dragon said in a statement on Monday. ``We have reassessed this
initiative and have concluded that we should not be competing
directly with our retail partners.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the filing, the company owes its 20 largest
creditors more than $101 million. The company, which is seeking to
restructure its debt, will close 110 stores, leaving only its
outlet locations open _ and these will be reviewed for performance
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The news could not have been consoling to other manufacturers
that have been rushing to open their own stores _ Ralph Lauren,
Donna Karan and dozens more. London Fog is a privately held
company, but Mark Millman, president of the Millman Search Group, a
Baltimore-based retail consultant and outlet store personnel
recruiter, has placed many executives with the company and has
followed it closely.
</P>
<P>
   He discussed how London Fog went awry and what other clothing
manufacturers could learn. Here are excerpts from the
conversation. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Not long ago London Fog was a pre-eminent retail brand. What
went wrong? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. In surveys as recently as seven or eight years ago, up to 92
percent of Americans recognized London Fog. It ranked right up
there with Coca-Cola and Pepsi as a great American brand. It
started to go wrong around then, when a new president forced the
company to make an ill-fated move from Eldersberg, Md., to
Connecticut. It cost the company many top executives. It was the
beginning of the end. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What happened next? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Someone came in with a very ambitious retail agenda, thinking
it would help the brand name. Then they went beyond outerwear and
got the company into sportswear. They decided to open up small
stores. Then they decided they could be a big-box retailer like
Wal-Mart and Home Depot and go into strip centers. Since they are
into weather gear, they said, ``Let's go into airports and train
stations.'' It all failed miserably. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. A lot of other brands are going big into retail. Is this a
warning for them? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. No. Retail can work for manufacturers, if it is done right.
For some manufacturers, their retail outlets are now 20 to 30
percent of the business. It can work when you have a limited number
of outlet stores in quality locations, and you have infrastructure
with people who really understand retail issues like merchandising.
Ellen Tracy is very successful, as is Nautica and Tommy Hilfiger. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. So what did London Fog do wrong in its stores? And what about
the department stores that made up its wholesale accounts? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. London Fog went into 140 locations _ that is way too many.
They had no business in opening 40,000-square-foot stores. And they
were paying too much money on the leases. Also, the wholesale
accounts were competing with retail. The move into retail was
ill-timed and ill-fated. London Fog has been slowly, slowly
descending since that period. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Some people think London Fog was in descent before retail.
Wasn't this inevitable? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Not at all. They brought one of the best-branded names in the
country to the bottom of the barrel in seven years. It is a sad
story, a textbook case in how not to manage a business.

A TURN OF EVENTS HAS LIMITS FOR GOLD

 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time was, ``Worth its weight in gold'' meant something. Trouble
is, for the past two decades, gold has been on a diet.
</P>
<P>
   For two days in early January 1980, a time of double-digit
interest rates and stagflation, gold fetched more than $800 an
ounce. But then the ride that had taken the metal up to that level
ended, and prices have been falling pretty much steadily ever
since. Earlier this year, they hit a 20-year low, at $252 an ounce.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past week, gold has perked up.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen European central banks said on Sept. 26 that they would
limit their sales of gold to 400 tons a year for the next five
years. With the fear removed that monetary authorities would swamp
the market and push the price lower, gold jumped more than $42 an
ounce in two days. On Friday it closed at $TKT.TK.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Marie Eveillard, portfolio manager of the Sogen Gold fund,
took some time last week to discuss what the gain does _ and does
not _ mean for investors. Here are excerpts from the conversation: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Has the rise in gold prices been due solely to the central
banks' announcement? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There may be some worry about Y2K and perhaps some worries
about the inflationary implications of a weaker dollar. But on
Sept. 26 there was a major turn of events that was unexpected,
particularly by me. As a result, I think things look good for gold
for the next few months. But to carry the price much higher than
the current $300 an ounce will take something else, like an
increase in investment demand. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What do you think motivated the European central banks to
take this step? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. On one level, they said that gold remains an important
monetary asset, a position Alan Greenspan shares. When he has been
asked about gold in the past, he has called it the ultimate form of
payment.
</P>
<P>
   But my own suspicion, which I cannot prove, is that the central
bankers may have been worried that too many hedge funds were
playing a gold ``carry trade'' with a lot of leverage. Until
recently, you could borrow gold at a rate of about 1 percent, turn
it into cash and buy two-year Treasury bills and pocket the
difference when you bought back the gold and returned it with the
interest. If you leveraged the purchase, you could make even more
money, because the price of gold was coming down.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the central banks were not lending gold to the hedge funds,
but to bullion banks, which in turn lend to hedge funds. By shaking
things up now, perhaps the central banks thought that by creating a
little bit of trouble now they might avoid a lot of trouble in six
months to a year. The memories of Long Term Capital are still
pretty fresh. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You started the fund in 1993, when gold had been in decline
for years. Why? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. When Warren Buffett bought silver last year, he said he had
observed that demand exceeded supply and concluded the imbalance
could only be resolved by a higher price for the commodity.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of gold, demand, mostly for jewelry, has exceeded
supply for the last 10 years. The gap has been somewhere between
500 and 1,000 tons a year. But it has been more than filled by
central bank selling, producers selling gold forward and commodity
funds shorting gold. That was my mistake.
</P>
<P>
   I started the gold fund not because inflation was coming back or
that monetary disaster was impending, but that the demand-supply
gap would take care of itself through an increase in price. It was
a big mistake on my part. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You said gold will need something extra to push it much
higher. Can you elaborate? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Anything more would be triggered by inflation, poor
performance by financial markets or a financial market crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the price can go to $350 an ounce, but no higher without
something like that.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, that is because there is price resistance on
jewelry, particularly in Asia. If the price of gold goes up more
than that, it will drive people out of the market. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Should investors consider gold, even if the upside in prices
is somewhat limited? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think gold can play a modest role in one's investment
portfolio. By modest, I mean a position that does not exceed 5
percent of assets.
</P>
<P>
   If one comes to that conclusion, the decision then is between
buying bullion, which is the least risky way, or gold mining and
related securities. The problem with securities is that you are
introducing considerable leverage. Whenever gold prices go up 10
percent or down 10 percent, securities fluctuate 30 percent in
either direction.
</P>
<P>
   In order to reduce risk, one is probably better off with
established producers like Newmont Mining and Homestake Mining, or
Placer Dome in Canada. And there are a few South African gold
stocks like Gold Fields Ltd. and Harmony Gold, which trade ADRs in
this country. The advantage they have is that they are a lot
cheaper than the Canadian and American stocks.

 &HT;    Christian Coalition founder says Bush is worthy of group's
support
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson had kind
words for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas on Friday at the group's
political convention, but called on congressional Republicans to
show more courage.
</P>
<P>
   He reminded Republicans in Congress that they achieved a
majority with the help of Christian conservatives and warned them
about compromising their conservative beliefs. ``It's better to
lose fighting a noble cause than to live in peace as a coward,''
Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   But he seemed to have no such qualms about Bush, even though
some coalition members suspect the governor is not conservative
enough on a range of social issues.
</P>
<P>
   While Robertson did not endorse Bush, he is openly in search of
a Republican candidate who can win in 2000, preferably with the
coalition's help. Bush appears to be the strongest Republican
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far George Bush has said things that cause me to believe
he'd be worthy of the support of Christian Coalition members,''
Robertson told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson praised Bush shortly before the candidate delivered
his standard stump speech to a few thousand delegates. Remarks
about his opposition to abortion was the only nod Bush made to the
socially conservative crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every child born and unborn must be protected by law and
welcomed to life,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that he signed a parental notification law on
abortion in Texas, saying ``Parents should be the first to help,
not the last to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush received a warm ovation from the audience, which filled a
hotel ballroom with many empty seats for other speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Reed, a Bush adviser and former coalition executive
director, said he believes the Texas governor has strong support
among coalition members. ``Given his standing in the polls, it's
demographically impossible for him not to have a plurality among
Christian conservatives,'' Reed said. ``He otherwise could not get
to those numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was also little doubt that Bush's centrist campaign
makes some coalition members uneasy. ``I like him, but people here
just seem nervous about him,'' said David Shepard of Arlington,
Va., a convention attendee who is not affiliated with any campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's remarks contrasted with those of conservative activist
Gary Bauer, who thundered his intent to appoint only dedicated
anti-abortion judges. ``I will not sacrifice one baby for political
gain,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of oratory drew rousing applause from delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire, who left the GOP this year and
is considering running as a third-party candidate for president,
said that if the Senate rejected a pro-life judicial nominee of
his, ``I'd send them another one and another one and another one.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole spoke about her
commitment ``to strive to lean on the Lord with my whole heart,
reading His Word daily and earnestly seeking His will in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, Bauer and other speakers were harshly critical of
Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, who told an interviewer in Playboy
magazine that organized religion is a ``sham'' and a crutch for the
weak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse is off his rocker,'' Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer suggested that instead of ``The Body'' or ``The Mind,''
Ventura's nickname should be ``The Bigot.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said Ventura had ``spoken like a true
pro wrestler.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson also had a warning for commentator Pat Buchanan, who
is thinking about moving his GOP presidential campaign to Ventura's
Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the Reform Party is ``180 degrees'' different from
Buchanan on social issues, Robertson predicted Buchanan would lose
the support of coalition members if he jumped.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan had been scheduled to address the convention, but his
staff said an unspecified conflict forced him to cancel his
appearance.

 By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ For decades, Jeon Eun-yong tried, with no
success, to convince the United States and South Korean governments
that U.S. soldiers had fired at his wife, young children and
hundreds of other civilians in 1950 during the early days of the
Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   So when word broke here Friday morning that in an Associated
Press article published this week former U.S. soldiers spoke about
the killings, neither his arthritis nor the heavy rains could keep
Jeon, a 77-year-old retiree, from attending a demonstration in
front of the U.S. Army base at Yongsan.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't begin to imagine the pain and anger I have felt all
these years,'' Jeon said, addressing a cheering crowd of about 50
protesters who chanted anti-American slogans and carried placards
calling for justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that the facts have been established, I want an apology,''
Jeon said. ``If America is to live up to its role as leading nation
of the world, it must uphold the human rights of the survivors of
the massacre as well as the deceased.''
</P>
<P>
   Though small in number, the protesters expressed the sentiments
of many South Koreans, who sharply criticized the United States for
long ignoring the claims of massacre survivors and called on their
own government to conduct an independent investigation.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Pentagon announced that it would undertake a
new and thorough inquiry into reports that U.S. soldiers killed
hundreds of refugees under a bridge near No Gun Ri in South Korea
at the start of the war.
</P>
<P>
   That new investigation was prompted by the AP article, in which
some of the U.S. soldiers at No Gun Ri said they had been ordered
to fire on the refugees because their commanders believed that
North Korean troops, disguised as peasants, had infiltrated a
refugee column and were shooting at the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Jeon, who became separated from his family as they fled the
war's early fighting, said that his son and daughter, ages 5 and 2,
were killed by U.S. gunfire as they took cover with his wife under
the bridge at No Gun Ri. Although his wife, Park Sun-yong, survived
the attack, she was critically wounded.
</P>
<P>
   She was not at the protest Friday but said in a telephone
interview from her home: ``Now, some of the burden from 50 years of
rage and sadness seems to be easing. Now I can die in peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see, my children's lives were taken away so unjustly. They
died such vicious deaths _ their bodies were ripped apart right in
front of my eyes. The U.S. secretary of defense can conduct all the
investigations he wants to, but he'll find that our memories of the
event are still the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Park, now 73, said that she harbors no bitterness toward the
United States, noting that after the attack a U.S. medic discovered
her bleeding and unconscious and saved her life.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Moon Bae-gol, director of a group called the Committee
to Stop Crime by the United States Military, on Friday called on
the United States to prosecute the soldiers who took part in the
massacre and to compensate relatives of those who perished.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He demanded that the South Korean government and the Parliament
form a special commission to investigate the incident. Sohn
Woo-hyun, a Korean government spokesman, said that the government
is currently gathering evidence on the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters at the military base said that violence by U.S.
soldiers in South Korea is not just a thing of the past but
continues today.
</P>
<P>
   They said dozens of crimes, including murder, theft and assaults
by U.S. soldiers, had gone unpunished in recent years. There are
more than 37,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   On a wall just outside the gate of the Yongsan Army Base, the
protesters hung graphic posters of battered South Koreans that they
said were victims of violent crimes by U.S. military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   An Army base official said that the incidence of crimes
committed by U.S. military personnel in Korea was no higher than in
society at large.
</P>
<P>
   The official said that the protesters had held a weekly rally in
front of the base for many years and that their claims of
widespread military violence by U.S. soldiers in Korea were greatly
exaggerated.

<P>
   As Coca-Cola's share price dropped below $48 in trading last
week, from a high of over $88 last year, investors were wondering:
Can it get any worse?
</P>
<P>
   It is pretty bad, and not just for Coke, whose recent track
record was described last week as ``the most significant
underperformance versus the S&AMP;P 500 in the history of the company''
by Andrew J. Conway, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico's share price is languishing at $31.375, well below the
company's 52-week high of $42.563. And Cadbury Schweppes, trading
as American depository receipts, is at $27.4375, down from a high
of $35.0625 within the last year. Bottlers like Pepsi Bottling
Group, the Whitman Corp. and Coca-Cola Enterprises are getting
clobbered, too.
</P>
<P>
   What has happened to the soft-drink stocks? The answer is part
global cautionary tale, part facts of life in the consumer products
business.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the downturn can be traced to the state of affairs at
Coke, which began a sharp decline 14 months ago. ``It starts at the
top,'' said Caroline Levy, an analyst for Schroder &AMP; Co. ``If Coke
is weak, it's very hard for Pepsi as well as the bottlers.''
</P>
<P>
   Coke's frailty is rooted in macroeconomic conditions around the
world that have gnawed at profits in a system designed when
emerging markets were booming. In countries like Germany, Japan and
Brazil, Coca-Cola's sales have been flat or falling for several
years, largely because consumers in those countries do not feel
they have the money to spend on what they perceive as a relatively
expensive American product.
</P>
<P>
   So second-tier brands have been cutting into Coke's market
share. In the United States, volume fell when bottlers raised
prices 5 percent to 6 percent earlier this year. The idea was to
regain profits lost during the last three years, when Coke and
Pepsi waged a price war in the supermarket aisles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, rather than having the stimulus of lower prices, we're
going to have the drag of higher prices,'' said Marc Cohen, an
analyst at Goldman Sachs. Sales of store-brand soda have been
creeping higher, too.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the investor retreat from Coke's stock can be attributed
to concern over the profitability of the two engines behind the
Coca-Cola system. Coke's return on invested capital _ 35 percent _
is far higher than that of its biggest bottler, Coca-Cola
Enterprises, which is about 5.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But even Coke's return on invested capital has been falling
lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think, in the long run, it's a great company with great
management, a great franchise and a great business model,'' said
David Garza, an analyst at Roxbury Capital Management, which has
sold most of its two million Coca-Cola shares since the beginning
of the year. ``The issue is the economics in the short run.'' He
added, ``Earnings growth is the worst it's been in decades.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's recall of 17 million cases of its products in France
and Belgium this spring has had more extensive repercussions than
the company publicly anticipated. Sales are still shaky in Italy,
Germany and Poland as a result of the recall, several analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   There are also worries about the effects of currency
devaluations abroad. And the company halted its share-repurchase
program earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Coke has said it will increase volume next year by 7 percent to
8 percent worldwide, and increase its earnings 15 percent to 20
percent. But analysts _ who are assiduously coached by Coke, but
have been burned in recent months as the company has failed to meet
its own earnings targets _ say that is an unreasonable expectation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe volume will grow 6 to 6.5 percent, and earnings per
share will be up 13 percent,'' said Bill Pecoriello, an analyst at
Sanford C. Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   Coke's once-hallowed executive suite is also coming in for
criticism. ``What people are worried about is why they are missing
their numbers,'' Ms. Levy said. ``The question is, is that global
economies? Or is that management?''
</P>
<P>
   The falling stock price reflects worry about whether Coke and
other global consumer products giants will ever again post the kind
of profit growth they did through most of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emperor has fewer clothes now than I thought,'' said
Daniel Peris, an analyst for Argus Research. He predicts that
Coke's share price will return to a more traditional valuation,
closer to the 71 percent premium to the S&AMP;P 500 price-to-earnings
multiple that it averaged over the last seven years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the premium was 96 percent, and in 1998, it rose to 106
percent. So far this year, the premium is about 83 percent, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Pepsico, management difficulties in the
soft-drink division are one cause of the stock's slide. But
analysts say some investors' worries may be exaggerated, since the
bulk of Pepsico's earnings are generated by its snack-food
business. ``Frito-Lay is easily one of the strongest consumer
packaged-goods companies that can be found,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected departure last month of Philip A. Marineau, the
former chief executive of Pepsi-Cola North America, sapped
confidence in Pepsico and its recently spun-off bottler, Pepsi
Bottling Group, analysts say. ``Part of PBG's selling proposition
to Wall Street was that Pepsi-Cola was under more solid
management,'' Cohen said. ``And the management decided to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottling company opened at $23 on March 31, rose to $25.25
in early July and was trading at $17.4375 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman, a major Pepsi bottler based outside Chicago, is down
44.5 percent for the year. It hit a 52-week low on Friday, trading
at $14 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Cadbury Schweppes has fared better, but is still down 20.6
percent for the year. Confusion about Cadbury's strategy, now that
it has sold many of its operations outside the United States to
Coca-Cola, hasn't helped.
</P>
<P>
   The soft-drink sector has experienced what Conway calls ``a
mini-implosion'' in recent weeks. ``The question is,'' he said,
``when will volumes return?''

THE RAINBOW DIDN'T JUST HAPPEN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The politics of immigration politics come up rarely these days,
at least in the newspapers. High-tech businessmen want more
greencards for engineers. Like a lot of topics, however, it lies
lightly on the mind of Pat Bucananan.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the bad boy of Republican politics got tangled up
in Ivy League admissions last fall when he complained of ``a
Harvard student body where non-Jewish whites _ 75 percent of the US
population _ get just 25 percent of the slots. Talk about
under-representation! Now we really know who gets the shaft at
Harvard -- white Christians.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Buchanan wants to send the 82nd Airborne Division to
the Mexican border! So a certain amount of apprehension is in the
air.
</P>
<P>
   Into this thundery situation has stepped George Borjas,
professor of public policy at the Kennedy School of Government of
Harvard University, and author of ``Heaven's Door: Immigration
Policy and the American Economy.''
</P>
<P>
   In it, he offers several reasons for his conviction that the
level of immigration should be scaled back to 1970s levels from its
current level of around a million people a year. He also recommends
the institution of a point system designed to give preference to
the more highly skilled, in order to spare America's least skilled
workers further competition at an especially difficult time.
</P>
<P>
   Borjas brings with him a fair amount of ideological baggage. A
refugee at the age of eight from Castro's revolution and a
conservative Republican, he served as adviser to ex-California
governor Pete Wilson in his failed 1996 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But he also brings a commitment to the highest standards of
empirical research. (He is a Columbia-trained economist greatly
influenced by a post-doctoral year at the University of Chicago.)
Thus even when one disagrees, it is possible to narrow the grounds.
A vigorous community of other economists studying the effects of
immigration serve to keep one another honest.
</P>
<P>
   Borjas traces the current situation to changes that began with
the 1965 Amendment to the Immigration and Nationality Act and
accelerated with its subsequent revisions. Before that, a quota
system governed immigration, guaranteeing the lion's share of
permits to immigrants from northern Europe, especially Great
Britain and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The 1965 amendment repealed the restrictions on national origins
that had been in place since the 1920s, increased the number of
visas, and made family ties to those already living in the United
States a key determinant for admission.
</P>
<P>
   The result of the change in the rules was an influx of Asian and
Hispanic citizens, especially Mexicans. In 1970, the US population
was 5 percent Hispanic, 8 percent Asian and 12 percent
African-American.
</P>
<P>
   In another fifty years the composition will be 26 percent
Hispanic, 8 percent Asian and 14 percent African-American,
according to a recent projection that Borjas cites. (The growth
rate is sustained by higher fertility rates among the second and
third generations of the immigrant population.)
</P>
<P>
   The rainbow complexion of our current population didn't just
happen, in other words. It was another expansive impulse of the
Great Society -- of a piece with civil rights legislation,
heightened sensitivity to gender and the expansion of Social
Security and healthcare programs. No more than the other struts is
it likely to be reversed.
</P>
<P>
   Borjas makes two main arguments. The first is that the
``quality'' of new immigrants has been dropping since 1965. Today's
newcomers have less schooling and fewer skills than their North
European precessors, he says. They are more likely to require
public assistance, less likely to integrate smoothly into American
life in the second and third generations.
</P>
<P>
   The second is that the new immigrants hurt the native poor. He
is highly alert to the significance of the pronounced decline in
relative wages of unskilled labor that took hold in the American
economy starting about 1980. It means that it is harder than ever
for those at the bottom of the ladder to make a living _ especially
if large numbers are continuously addded to those at the bottom of
the ladder
</P>
<P>
   In these circumstances, mainly the well-to-do gain. By dragging
down wages, immigrants shift around $160 billion from workers to
employers and the consumers of their services, he calculates.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to argue each of questions either way. Indeed,
Borjas himself has reversed his position from time to time. And new
evidence on the ``quality'' question _ the absolute and relative
level of skills of recent immigrants _ is being introduced all the
time. It is hard to believe on strictly intuitive grounds that
recent Asian and Hispanic immigrants are dragging down the level of
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   What really isn't acceptable is the alarmist tone that Borjas
adopts in framing the problem: his argument that the changes that
flowed from the 1965 amendement constitute a ``Second Great Wave''
of immigration, equal to the First Great Wave that unfolded between
1880 and 1924. Some 26 million Americans entered the country in
those years. He illustrates his conviction with a simple chart,
depicting two great spikes in the number of legal immigrants in the
United States peaking in 1910 -- and perhaps 1999.
</P>
<P>
   At the peak of the First Great Wave, during the years 1901 to
1910, immigrants were arriving at the rate of 900,000 a year. By
the early 1930s, after a decade of anti-immigrant agitation and
amidst the Great Depression,the flow slowed to a trickle. Starting
in the early 1980s, the annual rate of entry once again soared to
the 900,000 level. Hence, he says, a Second Great Wave.
</P>
<P>
   The difference, of course, has to do with the size of the total
population. In 1900, total US population was 76 million. Today it
is 272 million. A million a year additional citizens is a drop in
the bucket compared to the earlier time. At present rates, Botjas
says, it would take thirty years to reach the same level as 1910,
when 15 percent of the American population was foreign-born.
</P>
<P>
   Making the problem seem bigger than it is is a bad habit that
Borjas presumably picked up in Pete Wilson's failed campaign, which
was grounded in the experience of California's massive
in-migration. It is a legitimate strategy in politics. But it has
no place in a work of scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   For all its potential complexity, immigration policy comes down
to a single numerical target and a set of rules for achieving it.
Is the current rate of 1 million persons a year too many? Too few?
Just enough? Suppose we agreed to cut it by a quarter? By a third?
</P>
<P>
   This sort of thing is best answered by a blue-ribbon commission
-- after we see the results of the next election, and begin to form
an opinion about where the American electorate wants to go from
here.

SENATE WILL DEBATE TREATY BANNING NUCLEAR TESTING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., S.D., Pa., Va., Del.)  (mk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate leaders agreed Friday to begin debate next
Friday on a landmark treaty banning nuclear testing, and in a sign
of the Clinton administration's uphill fight to ratify the accord,
Defense Secretary William Cohen cut short by a day his trip to Asia
to return here and prepare strategy with the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, R-Miss., and his
Democratic counterpart, Thomas Daschle of South Dakota, agreed to
begin 14 hours of general debate on Oct. 8 and resume on Oct. 12,
with a vote taking place that day or soon thereafter. Lott had
originally offered to start the debate on Oct. 6, but Democrats
balked.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans expressed confidence Friday that they have
more than 40 ``hard'' votes in their ranks against the treaty, more
than the 34 necessary to block ratification of one of President
Clinton's top foreign policy goals. It takes the approval of
two-thirds of the Senate, or 67 votes if all 100 senators are
present, to ratify a treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., one of two Republicans who openly
support the test ban, expressed hope that a concerted White House
campaign and classified briefings for senators might change some
critics' minds, but he voiced doubt. ``I am very much concerned
that the votes are there to pass,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats heaped scorn on the Foreign Relations Committee's
continuing refusal to hold hearings on a treaty that falls under
its jurisdiction. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was signed by
Clinton in 1996, and hearings have never been held. But Sen. John
Warner, R-Va., a treaty opponent who heads the Armed Services
Committee, said Friday that his panel would hold three days of
hearings beginning next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Warner said in an interview that he expected the witnesses to
include former secretaries of defense and chairmen of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, who will be asked to assess the future safety and
reliability of America's nuclear arsenal if testing is banned. The
United States has not conducted nuclear tests since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also attacked Senate Republicans for scheduling a
quick vote without adequate time for hearings and analysis of a
weighty foreign policy issue, even though Democrats on Capitol Hill
and the administration have been clamoring for a vote for months.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the National Security Council, David Leavy, said
the White House would intensify its lobbying campaign next week
with a Rose Garden ceremony featuring Clinton, Cabinet members,
congressional supporters and Nobel laureates who back the treaty.
``The president is going to work aggressively to make his case to
the people,'' Leavy said
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has told her
staff to do everything possible to win Senate approval of the
treaty, seen as a test of Washington's commitment to arms control.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials stepped up their offensive Friday
morning, with Undersecretary of State John Holum, a top arms
control expert, arguing that a test ban would lock in American
nuclear superiority and curb the growth of nuclear states.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no need to test and no plans to test,'' Holum said.
With the treaty in effect, he said, it will be ``very difficult for
new countries to develop nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   But opponents say the treaty would undermine the country's
ability to insure the safety and reliability of the nuclear
stockpile. In the past few weeks, Senate critics have quietly lined
up a stable of national security experts who oppose the treaty to
advise senators, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats who have fought to free the stalled treaty say they
had no choice but to push for a vote, even against steep odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our choice is either let it die by attrition and have no one
be held accountable, or take a shot at it and have the president
and all of us make the strongest case we can,'' said Sen. Joseph
Biden, a D-Del.

PURDUE IS ON A ROLL WITH NO SIGN OF LETTING UP 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ANN ARBOR, Mich. _ How long has it been since ``Purdue
Boilermakers'' and ``football power'' have shared the same
sentence?
</P>
<P>
   Study the musty benchmarks. A victory against Michigan on
Saturday means Purdue would match the 11-game winning streak set
from 1928 to 1930. It means the Boilermakers would be 5-0 for the
first time since 1945. It means the 11th-ranked Boilermakers would
crack the top 10 Associated Press poll for the first time since
finishing No. 10 at the end of the 1979 season.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, it means the modern age offense of Coach Joe
Tiller and the Heisman Trophy-caliber arm of Drew Brees puts Purdue
in the Big Ten title hunt _ at least for a week.
</P>
<P>
   If Purdue survives the No. 4 Wolverines at Michigan, No. 12 Ohio
State awaits in Columbus next week, followed by consecutive home
dates against No. 14 Michigan State and No. 2 Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an unbelievable stretch,'' Tiller said. ``It will be a
real test for us, but I think we've got to lighten up and enjoy the
moment, the opportunity to play this level or caliber of
competition. That's a difficult draw for anybody. But that's the
way the schedule has been set, so we plan on being there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boilermakers will not be unarmed as they embark on what they
hope is a brawl to the Rose Bowl. They have Brees and a
multiple-set spread offense that Tiller brought from Wyoming in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   In only 24 games, 17 of them as a starter, Brees has thrown 49
touchdown passes and has amassed 5,530 yards. He is so comfortable
at the controls of the nation's ninth best team in scoring and
total offense _ 41 points, 447 yards a game _ that he believes a
perfect game is in reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think I should complete every pass, unless I'm trying
to throw the ball away to avoid a sack,'' said Brees, a junior.
</P>
<P>
   But the Wolverines (4-0) will counter with the nation's 18th
stingiest defense, one that gives up only 271 yards a game, and one
that pretty much derailed the Heisman aspirations of Wisconsin
running back Ron Dayne when it held him to 88 yards _ zero in the
second half _ last week in a 21-16 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan's defenders say they relish having an impact on the
outcome of the nation's most coveted college award. The defense is
already responsible for keeping the Wolverines' national title
drive alive while the offense has struggled with its transformation
from a running team (117 yards a game) to a passing team (223.8
yards).
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to change gears at any time and learn things quick,''
Michigan safety DeWayne Patman said. ``If you want to be a great
defense you have to learn a lot of different coverages. It's a big
challenge going against another Heisman Trophy candidate. And we
accept this challenge. We wouldn't have it any other way: to have a
great running back come in and then have a great quarterback come
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan Coach Lloyd Carr does not expect his defense to do to
Brees and Purdue what it did to Dayne and the Badgers' running
game. The one statistic Carr marvels at is one the Wolverine
defense must shatter if it hopes to contain Brees: the pass-happy
quarterback has only been sacked once.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would have to play a perfect game to stop it, and even
then I don't know if you could stop it because there is too much
space between the defenders,'' Carr said of Purdue's offense. ``You
are spread out and they have enough speed to throw the ball deep.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr said to keep Brees off balance you have to mix up the
coverages and the pass rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most impressive thing about Purdue, in spite of all the
statistics passing, is the fact that Brees has only been sacked
once,'' Carr said. ``That speaks of his athleticism, his getting
the ball off quickly and the job the offensive line is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   And that will be the key to whether Purdue updates its record
books and continues on the road to the Rose Bowl. &QL;

CAN `NEUROBICS' DO FOR THE BRAIN WHAT AEROBICS DO FOR LUNGS?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 3) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., N.J., Calif., Fla., Mich.)  (af) 
 By ABBY ELLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three years ago, in chatting with a guest at the Holiday Inn she
manages in Binghamton, N.Y., Candace Jones found herself confiding
in him about her problems renovating the hotel and managing her
staff.
</P>
<P>
   The guest, Anthony Dottino, president of the Dottino Consulting
Group in Old Tappan, N.J., suggested that she let him take a crack
at solving the problems. Ms. Jones agreed, joining a list of
clients _ including IBM, Consolidated Edison, British Airways and
Johnson &AMP; Johnson _ that have sought Dottino's help with business
applications of brain research.
</P>
<P>
   Contending that managers need to make use of ``intellectual
capital,'' Dottino has created what he calls a comprehensive mental
literacy program to help employees unleash their creative energies.
``The human being has unlimited creativity if focused and nurtured
properly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he is far from alone. Although some neuroscientists dismiss
the trend, business people are increasingly using pop neurology or
``neurobics'' _ brain teasers, puzzles and cognitive exercises _ in
the belief that mental workouts enhance job performance, just as
aerobic workouts build fitness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baloney,'' said Dr. Michael Gruber, director of neuro-oncology
at New York University Medical Center, adding there was no
scientific evidence to support neurobics.
</P>
<P>
   His colleague, Dr. Carol Maxfield, a neuropsychologist in the
center's psychiatry department, conceded, however, that the new
brain programs might have a placebo effect on users. ``On a
psychological level, if someone does a group of exercises that they
really believe will help them concentrate, they just might,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Elizabeth Gould, a neurobiologist in Princeton
University's psychology department, said that while mental
exercises were likely to enhance brain functioning, ``reading,
playing the piano or doing any number of different hobbies that
don't involve passive participation are probably enough.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, William M. Jenkins, a former professor of
neuroscience at the University of California at San Francisco,
School of Medicine, has embraced the field, becoming vice president
for development at Scientific Learning, a company in Berkeley,
Calif., that uses brain research and technology to develop products
intended to enhance human learning and performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientists have found that the brain is capable of altering
its connections,'' Jenkins said. ``The brain learns best through
associations, by linking new information to existing information in
synergistic fashion. You have the ability to change the synaptic
connections within the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Holiday Inn, Dottino met with the staff and encouraged
them to speak freely about their boss, while teaching them to draw
mind maps _ visual tools that resemble family trees but link words,
colors and pictures to express thoughts and ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a map of thinking that one has on a particular topic,''
said Dottino, co-author of ``The Brain Smart Leader'' (Gower,
1999). ``It maps one's neural patterns, or thoughts, in an
associative and connected fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Ms. Jones' employees expressed feelings that her
managing style was too didactic and controlling and that she
treated them like children. Dottino invited her into the meeting,
and they then told her how they felt. ``It wasn't easy listening,
but it was a positive step because it forced me to come to grips
with things I needed to improve on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dottino came to neurobics after a career in financial and
executive management at IBM, and while he is not a neuroscientist,
he is a convincing and passionate speaker, whose clients point with
satisfaction to the results he has achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising sales through Oct. 1 at WMXJ, a Miami radio station,
for example, were 10 percent ahead of a year earlier, after the
station's employees worked on mind maps with Richard Israel, a
colleague of Dottino's, according to Dennis Collins, senior vice
president for the station.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Bannon, former director of corporate accounting services
at IBM in Endicott, N.Y., recalled that the company was
restructuring and undergoing major layoffs when Dottino was doing
consulting work for IBM in 1992. ``Because of all the tension,
people were in a major state of paralysis,'' Bannon said.
</P>
<P>
   So he brought in Dottino, who had employees map their issues.
``The first time my boss saw me doing a mind map, he told me to
stop doodling,'' Bannon recalled. Nevertheless, he said, using
Dottino's methods, he was able to increase productivity in his
department enough to avoid more than two dozen planned job cuts in
the 18 months the consultant was there.
</P>
<P>
   Business people who want to test the idea of a mental workout
can do so easily without calling in a consultant. Numerous Web
sites offering memory- and attention-improving products have popped
up, including a mind map software program call Mind Manager
(www.mindmanager.com).
</P>
<P>
   Among the others are supermemo.com; brain.com; neurobics.com,
and enchantedmind.com, which presents a new set of puzzles weekly.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbia University School of Business has expressed
interest in Brain.com's services, especially Thinkfast, a series of
brain teasers and IQ tests.
</P>
<P>
   Al Thorrez, co-owner of Al Thorrez Industries, a maker of
automotive, tractor and office furniture parts in Jackson, Mich.,
was so impressed with Brain.com's products _ ``They increased my
decision-making and ability to think clearly,'' he said _ that he
invested in the company. He also said he had found its 12-minute IQ
test an effective way to screen job applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Bannon, now controller at Maxtor, a disk drive maker in San
Jose, Calif., said, ``We've been taught that as we get older, we
lose our memory.'' But that need not be so, he contended. ``The
older you get, the more connections and associations your brain
should be making,'' he said, ``Therefore you should have more
information stored in your brain. You just need to tap into it.''
</P>
<P>
   David Hill, a systems specialist at Con Edison, has similar
feelings. In the past, new employees at the company's nuclear power
plant in Buchanan, N.Y., were given thick notebooks; now they learn
with mind maps _ a great way to convey ``dry, boring material,''
Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mind-mapping, mental skills and intellectual capital are the
things that will make the difference in the next 100 years,'' Hill
said. ``It's the wave of the future.''

   The all-new 2000 Suburban, which made its worldwide public debut
at the State Fair of Texas, goes into production this month,
completely redesigned and much better.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicles will begin arriving at Texas dealerships in
December, but the rest of the nation won't see them until January,
General Motors officials said.
</P>
<P>
   There might be some confusion among shoppers at GMC dealers,
however, because the new GMC version of the venerable Suburban has
a new name: Yukon XL.
</P>
<P>
   Suburban fans can rest assured that it's the same vehicle as the
one called Suburban at Chevy dealers. But GMC officials said they
felt it was time to call their vehicle something different.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be foolish on our part to continue spending
advertising dollars on a Chevrolet name, especially since they
already outsell us two to one,'' Yukon Brand Manager Denny
O'Donnell said during a recent media ride-and-drive program for the
new Yukons. ``That's sort of like McDonald's and Burger King both
selling the Whopper.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite. Chevrolet and GMC are entities of the same
company. But I have often wondered why they would call the Suburban
the same thing under both the GMC and Chevrolet banners.
</P>
<P>
   What's important, though, is that the two vehicles are the same,
and they're bigger, more powerful and much more refined than
before. Considering that they were already very popular, especially
in Texas and California, which account for about half of their
sales, the big sport-utilities could be poised to take an even
larger share of the SUV market.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is only one competitor as big as the
Suburban/Yukon XL _ the all-new Ford Excursion (which is 7 inches
longer and about 2,000 pounds heavier than the Suburban) _ the
Suburban has been going head to head against the Ford Expedition
and its clone, the Lincoln Navigator, since the Expedition was
introduced in 1996. Expedition accounts for 35 percent of the sales
in the full-size SUV class in which Suburban is lumped.
</P>
<P>
   The new Suburban and Yukon XL are just slightly longer versions
of the Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon full-size SUVs. Until now, the
biggest difference was that only the Suburban came with a third
seat, but even that has changed for 2000. To help meet the
challenge from Expedition, which has always offered a third seat,
the extra seat now is available in the Tahoe and standard-length
Yukon.
</P>
<P>
   With that third seat in place, there is very little cargo space
in the shorter vehicles. To maintain ample cargo room with a third
seat, you have to go with the longer Suburban or Yukon XL.
</P>
<P>
   The exterior appearance of the big new SUVs is no surprise to
those who have seen the redesigned Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra
full-size pickups introduced last year. From the back of the front
seat forward, the Suburban, Tahoe, Yukon and Yukon XL look
identical to their pickup counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   The new Suburban/Yukon XL is wider and taller than before, but
it's a fraction of an inch shorter, and it has a shorter turning
radius. That radius is nearly five feet less than that of the
Excursion. And, GM officials like to point out, the Suburban/Yukon
XL still fit nicely in a standard residential garage and a downtown
parking space.
</P>
<P>
   Those are definite advantages in the marketplace for the
Suburban, said Bruce Aiello, GM's assistant vehicle line manager
for full-size SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   ``During our marketing studies, no one asked us to make the
Suburban seven inches longer and 2,000 pounds heavier,'' he said.
``People did ask for us to make it roomier, and we have
delivered.''
</P>
<P>
   Suburban and Yukon XL offer a choice of a full swing-up tailgate
or full-height double doors that open to the sides, just like the
previous models. There is no price differential.
</P>
<P>
   Two new Vortec V-8 engines are offered in the Suburban and Yukon
XL, and they are more powerful and more durable than ever, GM
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The base engine, standard on the half-ton Suburban and Yukon XL,
is a 5.3-liter V-8 rated at 285 horsepower and 325 foot-pounds of
torque. That's 30 more horsepower than the 5.7- liter V-8 that it
replaces.
</P>
<P>
   Standard on the heavier 3/4-ton models is a 6.0-liter V-8 with
300 horsepower and 355 foot-pounds of torque.
</P>
<P>
   These engines give the new Suburban and Yukon XL higher tow
ratings and allow for higher gross weight capacities. Despite the
Excursion's bigger size and engines, the Suburban and Yukon XL
still outrank it in towing capacity. Maximum trailer weight with
the 5.3-liter engine is 9,000 pounds; with the 6.0-liter engine,
that climbs to 10,500 pounds (500 more than Excursion).
</P>
<P>
   Four-speed automatic transmissions are standard, and they have
been improved to provide more durability, GM said.
</P>
<P>
   Ride and handling are better, steering response is improved, the
body and frame are stiffer than last year's, and there are choices
of suspensions offered. The ride is much smoother and more carlike
than that of the Excursion, which is built on the chassis of Ford's
Super Duty pickup line.
</P>
<P>
   An option is the new Autoride suspension, which automatically
varies the amount of shock-absorber action to provide the same
level of control and stability whether the vehicle is empty or
loaded, or pulling a trailer. Half-ton models with this suspension
have an automatic rear leveling system that uses compressed air.
</P>
<P>
   The interior has improved dramatically. For the first time,
automatic climate control is offered, and the air-conditioning
vents are easy adjusted for direction. The front bucket seats are
very comfortable, and rear passengers get more leg and head room.
</P>
<P>
   Power windows and door locks are standard, and the door locks
can be programmed four ways to allow for automatic or manual
locking and unlocking.
</P>
<P>
   Shoulder belts on the front and third-row seats are attached to
the back of the seat rather than the side walls so they don't ride
up on the neck, a major point of irritation for occupants in many
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Among the safety features are four-wheel antilock brakes, front
and side air bags for the front seats, telescoping front frame
rails designed to absorb energy in a frontal collision, and
energy-absorbing foam inside the interior trim to help protect the
driver and passengers' heads during a collision.
</P>
<P>
   Suburban's three trim levels are the base model, the midlevel LS
and the top-of-the-line LT. The LT comes with leather interior and
automatic climate control, among other amenities.
</P>
<P>
   Yukon XL comes in two trim levels: the base model is the SLE,
and the high-end one is the SLT, which includes leather interior.
You have to choose a ``luxury convenience package'' to add the
automatic climate control.
</P>
<P>
   Both vehicles are offered in two- or four-wheel-drive in all
configurations. GM says about 65 percent of all sales are expected
to be four-wheel drive models. But in Texas, probably only about 20
percent of buyers will choose four-wheel drive, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen-inch wheels are standard, and available designs include
chromed steel and polished, brushed or painted aluminum.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings were not provided, but you should
expect a range of 12-16 miles per gallon based on previous
performance of these vehicles. The tank holds 26 gallons. &QL;

KATHERINE ANN POWER FINISHES JAIL TERM IN 1970 KILLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Katherine Ann Power haunted Clare Schroeder for years.
She would stare at Power's face on the FBI's Most Wanted List,
puzzled at the face staring back.
</P>
<P>
   The wispy bangs and thick eyeglasses, the chunky-toothed smile,
belied Power's militant, rebellious side. For 23 years, Schroeder
prayed police would find Power, who vanished after her involvement
in the 1970 shooting death of Schroeder's father, a Boston police
officer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, when Power gave herself up, Schroeder finally got what
she wanted: to see Power in handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   But today, as Power is released from prison in Framingham,
Schroeder says she is no closer to forgiving Power than she was the
day she fled Boston. But she hopes that Power is sincere when she
says she was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what forgiveness is in this circumstance,''
Schroeder said. ``I'm not going to extract any vengeance. I don't
wish her ill will. Other than that, she has no significance for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The day Walter Schroeder died, Sept. 24, 1970, the lives of both
women _ the victim's eldest daughter and the fugitive _
dramatically changed.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the two women have been entwined in the minds of
anyone who looks at the bank robbery shooting as a reflection of a
tumultuous time, when youthful activism blurred into the realm of
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since Power turned herself in, Clare Schroeder, 46,
has struggled to understand Power's actions as a renegade driver of
the getaway car, the woman who spirited away the man who shot her
father in the back, before getting away with $26,000 in cash. And
Power has had to come to grips with her past, with living 23 years
as a lie. She surrendered, Power later said, because her conscience
was eating away at her.
</P>
<P>
   Only in prison, after years of therapy did Power come to terms
with her guilt, Power told a parole board in March 1998, after
withdrawing her request for release.
</P>
<P>
   ``My work in prison has been to peel off the layers of that
defensiveness, to get to the point where I could look squarely into
the pained, accusing faces of the victims of my crime and say, `I
was wrong. I was wrong all along. Before God I am sorry. I will
always be so sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, she issued a similar statement: ``Today marks the
payment of my legal debt for my role in the murder of Walter
Schroeder. But I will always carry my human responsibility for the
sorrow my actions have caused. As I noted in my parole statement of
March, 1998, I do not intend to cultivate media attention to my
feelings, to my problems, or to what the media see as my `drama.'
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a time to acknowledge that a human life, once lost, is
lost forever: that the death of a father, husband, and brother is a
terrible event, and one for which I will always be deeply sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
The daughter.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clare Schroeder tightened her grip on the phone, agitated at the
stranger babbling about wanting to save her father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should I go to the hospital to donate blood? Do you think it
will save your father?'' the man repeated.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, a senior at Mount St. Joseph Academy, remembers his
words swarming like mosquitoes; she couldn't process them.
</P>
<P>
   Just then, her mother walked into the house, with such a hollow
sadness in her eyes, that, with just one glance, Schroeder knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to worry about donating blood,'' she bluntly
spoke into the receiver. ``My father is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   From that day forward, Schroeder was no longer just big sis to
her eight brothers and sisters. She took on more and more
responsibilities, helping her mother cope with the cooking, the
cleaning, the disciplining.
</P>
<P>
   Her family moved to a quiet street in Waltham, away from the
Brighton neighborhood where there were too many reminders. But they
couldn't get away from the memories, or the reporters who always
asked the same question: ``Where is Katherine Power?''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder's mother, Marie, a very private woman, would not talk
to the media, so it fell on her. She became the family
spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
   She spoke when Power became the longest woman to remain on the
FBI's Ten Most Wanted List. When the FBI took her off the list,
media crews flocked to her doorstep. Every time rumors surfaced
about Power being found, every time media did the `Whatever
happened to Katherine Ann Power?' story, Schroeder spoke up.
</P>
<P>
   She kept tabs on the investigation, especially after she became
a cop herself. Following in her father's footsteps, she joined the
Waltham police force after graduating from Regis College.
</P>
<P>
   The day of Power's sentencing, Schroeder met with Boston Police
Lieutenant Timothy Murray of the Cold Case Squad. He showed her his
files, the places throughout the country he thought Power might be.
Just a few months before Power surrendered, Schroeder said Murray
had compiled a list of 300 names _ all possible aliases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alice Metzinger was on that list,'' said Schroeder. ``I'm
convinced he would've tracked her down. He's a phenomenal
investigator.''
</P>
<P>
   As a detective, Schroeder made a living trying to understand
criminal minds. But understanding Power seemed to be as elusive as
finding her.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, she came to this conclusion: That Power arrogantly
believed her cause justified her illegal, immoral behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a group of young idealists whose goal was peace
and harmony,'' Schroeder told the parole board two years ago.
``These people were experienced career criminals whose only goal
was to reap profit for themselves regardless of the consequences to
anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people protested the war in Vietnam. They would
perform acts of civil disobedience, they burned draft cards, and
did a lot of things, but they didn't steal guns and rob banks,''
she said. ``To me, it's hypocritical.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder doesn't want to relive the past, and says that she
never let anger consume her. She looks at Power's release as the
end of a chapter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm satisfied in that she's fulfilled what the state requires
of her,'' Schroeder said. ``The length of time served is
irrelevant. It doesn't change anything.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
The fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Ann Power stood in her Beacon Street studio hours
after the bank robbery, surrounded by a stash of rifles, shotguns,
and grenades.
</P>
<P>
   She kept the radio on, and heard the news: ``Boston Police
Officer Walter Schroeder has been shot...''
</P>
<P>
   Her group's plan _ to rob $26,000 from the State Street Bank in
Brighton to fund their antiwar campaign _ crossed the line of
militant activism to terrorism. A day later Schroeder died and now
murder hung over their heads. Power and the four others went
underground.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, police caught her accomplices: Robert Valeri within
hours, William ``Lefty'' Gilday and Stanley Bond within days. Five
years later, the FBI nabbed Susan Saxe. But Katherine Ann Power
continued to elude police, year after year.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen, Power semed a model citizen in the making. She was
valedictorian of her Denver high school, the product of Catholic
schools, the daughter of Winfield Power, a banker, and Marjorie
Power, a nurse. As a teen, she won a Betty Crocker Homemaker Award
for her sewing and cooking skills. But later, on the campus of
Brandeis University, she became a fervent crusader against US
involvement in the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, though, she found herself at its violent fringes. She
hooked up with Stanley Bond, an ex-con with a seventh-grade
education who charmed his way into Brandeis through a government
program for parolees. Together with Bond, a violent thief who spent
time in Walpole State Prison, they became a 60s version of Bonnie
and Clyde, robbing several banks, and even breaking into a National
Guard Armory in Newburyport, to steal a cachet of weapons to use in
their antiwar campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Several days later, after careful planning, Bond, Saxe, Gilday,
and Valeri stormed the State Street Bank, armed with high-powered
guns. Power _ who later said she was not considered dependable
enough to join the others inside the bank _ waited in a humming
Ford stationwagon six blocks away. Her accomplices rode by in the
getaway car, a blue Chevy, and hopped into the ``switch'' car.
Gilday remained behind, where, unbeknownst to the others, he shot
Officer Schroeder in the back, piercing his aorta. He bled to
death.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Power was on the run, changing identities several times
before settling in rural Oregon as Alice Metzinger, wife,
restaurateur, mother.
</P>
<P>
   After serving six years of an 8- to 12-year prison term at MCI
Framingham, less time for good behavior, Power walks out of prison
and can finally be herself again. No more fake identities. No more
lies.
</P>
<P>
   But everywhere she goes, she knows a spotlight will be on her.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she leaves she hopes to leave the legal system behind,''
said her attorney, James M. Doyle. ``She does not want to be a
celebrity. It's that kind of human interest in her that detracts
from the enormity of the crime she committed.''

 &HT;    Carter celebrates 75 years, happily at home in the town of his
birth
 &HT;    By Alan Judd
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLAINS, Ga. _ On his 75th birthday Friday in the place where he
was born, former President Jimmy Carter was all smiles.
</P>
<P>
   He grinned broadly as schoolchildren serenaded him with ``Happy
Birthday'' at the national historic site that bears his name. He
beamed as celebrities such as Pat Boone, the Indigo Girls, the
McGuire Sisters and Sam Donaldson of ABC News honored him during a
black-tie birthday party in nearby Americus, where a giant birthday
cake blocked a downtown street.
</P>
<P>
   The state's most prominent resident and Georgia's 76th governor
seemed happiest, though, when he talked about his enduring
relationship with his neighbors in Plains, a southwest Georgia town
of 712 people. It's a hometown that has repeatedly sent him off to
wage political battle and, more important, has always welcomed him
home _ win or lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just been overwhelming,'' Carter said of the affection he
has felt in Plains as his milestone birthday approached. ``The
friendship and support, I have to say, are typical of what the
folks around here have always extended to me...''
</P>
<P>
   ``The intimacy with which I grew up as a boy here among these
same folks has been continued and even expanded,'' he said during a
private interview at the Jimmy Carter National Historic Site, the
former Plains High School. ``Our life has been here in Plains. This
has always been my home.''
</P>
<P>
   For James Earl Carter Jr., who studied nuclear physics but would
rather describe himself as a peanut farmer, Plains has always
served not just as hometown, but as metaphor. It is a simple,
straightforward place that gave the country a simple,
straightforward man as its 39th president.
</P>
<P>
   But even as he became a citizen of the world, monitoring
elections and fighting war and poverty in developing nations across
the globe since he left the White House almost 19 years ago, Jimmy
Carter has remained a citizen of Plains. That means a lot to the
others who live there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loves this community,'' said Rudy Hayes, who came to the
historic site to wish his old friend happy birthday Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In Plains, where Carter's 1976 presidential campaign
headquarters still dominates the small downtown and artifacts like
a giant peanut with a toothy smile still dot the landscape,
``everybody likes Jimmy Carter,'' Hayes said. ``Even people who a
long time ago may not have liked him politically.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering his fourth quarter-century, Carter seems to have made
peace with his political enemies, in Plains and elsewhere. He said
he consults frequently with former President Gerald Ford, whom he
defeated in 1976, on ways to repair what he called the ``really
sad'' state of American politics. He spoke wistfully of how he and
former President Ronald Reagan, who denied Carter a second term in
1980, referred to each other as ``my distinguished opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter would like to diminish money's influence on political
campaigns. But he is a realist: ``Obviously a former president
can't be too directly influential over what the Congress does.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he spends much of his time on the work of the Carter
Center, helping ``people and countries ignored by the rest of the
world.'' That work, he said, has given him a wisdom he lacked as
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a much greater insight into the ambitions and the
family values and the initiatives that ignored people have within
them,'' he said. ``And also the suffering that they have to endure
with unnecessary wars and with poverty and hunger and lack of
shelter.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important, he added, ``I understand how much the
United States could do to alleviate suffering and prevent wars that
I didn't understand when I was president.''
</P>
<P>
   His 75th birthday, Carter said, has prompted him to reflect not
just on his place on the world stage, but also in Plains. It is, he
pointed out, the only place in America that is the hometown of both
a president and a first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our families, who were born in the 1700s, are buried here, and
we own the same land that we've had since the Indians left,'' he
said. ``Our churches have been the foundation for our lives. This
building _ Rosalynn and I both went all our elementary and high
school years here. Our three boys did the same. Even Rosalynn's
mother went here. She's 94 years old now.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you can see our ties are very deep.''
</P>
<P>
   The birthday party _ at the recently restored Rylander Theatre
in Americus, 12 miles east of Plains _ further tweaked Carter's
reminiscing. The Rylander was an important part of his childhood,
providing the only glimpse of a world beyond the peanut and cotton
farms that surrounded Plains and Americus.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager, he would work late _ 9:30 or 10 _ at his uncle's
store in Plains on Saturday nights, then get a ride to Americus to
see a movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite often with a date from Plains,'' he added. ``Or
sometimes I'd meet an Americus girl over there.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``most momentous event'' of those years, he said, was when
``Gone With the Wind'' opened at the Rylander.
</P>
<P>
   ``School turned out,'' he said, ``and they hauled us to the
theater in buses so they could make sure everybody saw `Gone With
the Wind.'''
</P>
<P>
   Plains and Americus have changed little since those days, he
said, except in one important way.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy, Carter recalled, he and African-American playmates
from the Archery community outside Plains would want to see movies
together at the Rylander. They could walk to the train station in
Plains together, but ``we had to sit in different parts of the
train'' to Americus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we'd get to Americus at the railroad station and we'd
walk together to the theater,'' he said. ``Then my playmates would
go upstairs to the third floor, and I would go to the bottom
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused a moment, thinking about his 75th birthday party in
the same building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' he added, ``everybody will be sitting everywhere.''

CELTICS OWNER FOREGOES $1 MILLION SALARY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Celtics owner Paul Gaston declined his $1 million
salary for the fiscal year that ended June 30 after a tough
financial season for the franchise, due to the NBA owners' lockout
of players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a personal decision, he felt it was the right thing to
do because of the lockout,'' said Celtics' executive vice-president
Richard Pond.
</P>
<P>
   There is precedent for the move. NBA Commissioner David Stern
declined to collect his salary for the period of the lockout, which
lasted until Jan. 20 and erased 32 games of the Celtic's 82-game
season.
</P>
<P>
   The lockout began July 1, 1998 and had a substantial negative
impact on the Celtics' bottom line. Revenue for the fiscal year
ending June 30 was $43 million compared to $75.7 million in the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Celtics LP, the ownership group for the
publicly-trade franchise, last month reported a loss of $10.1
million. The team told the Securities and Exchange Commission that
it lost $950,000 in ticket revenue and $115,000 in broadcast fees
per game.
</P>
<P>
   Gaston would make no public comment on his decision to forego
his salary, which was first reported by Street &AMP; Smith's
SportsBusiness Journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just talked to him and he said, `I don't even know what all
of the fuss is about.' '' Pond said. ``He basically told me answer
the questions, but he doesn't see it as a big deal.

   ``The questions I've gotten is was he forced to do it?
Absolutely not, this was completely a decision that he made,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pond denied that Gaston's move or the poor economic performance
of the team last year suggested that the franchise is financially
troubled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' Pond said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gaston family, including Paul's father Don, who passed
control of the team to his son, has other, considerable business
ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``His family I am sure has all kinds of other investments,''
Pond said. `I don't even know them all. But I am certain from some
of those other ventures that he derives income.''

POKEMON CRAZE JUST KEEPS GROWING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT L. JAMIESON JR.  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Kate Speck is a Pok-e-chick.
</P>
<P>
   She collects Pokemon game cards, saving her modest allowance _ a
buck a week _ to splurge.
</P>
<P>
   She watches Pokemon on TV. She has Pokemon stuffed animals.
Pokemon books. Even a Pokemon keychain. And Kate will croon a giddy
tune based on, well, you know, the P-word.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yeah, and there was the time Kate's buddy Mia had a birthday
party and Kate gave a gift of Pokemon cards and Mia opened the deck
and _ oh brother! _ inside was this sparkly Pokemon card Kate
wanted really, really BAAAD!!!
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I didn't ask her for it,'' Kate says, the sound of
gentle longing in her voice. ``I mean, it was her birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough.
</P>
<P>
   Kate's mom is a cardiologist and her dad's a writer, but not
even their combined brain power can figure out why Kate _ a
self-described ``average'' fanatic at 8 _ goes bonkers over a tiny
yellow Pokemon creature with a name that sounds like a sneeze:
Pikachu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep telling them what I like about it,'' the Seattle girl
giggles. ``They just don't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Duh.
</P>
<P>
   But plenty of young people do get it _ and they are eating up
the Pokemon cultural feast of video games, trading cards, a
television show, comic books, T-shirts, soundtracks and notebooks.
The menu keeps growing.
</P>
<P>
   There are Pokemon leagues. Pokemon tournaments. Pokemon
contests. Pokemon Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, a full-length Pokemon movie hits the big screen; toy
experts say Pokemon will be THE THING for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo _ which is to be lauded or blamed for hatching Pokemon
_ even serves up training tours, aimed at teaching kids how to
develop skills and ``train how to battle'' for Pokemon tournaments
using Game Boys, Nintendo's hand-held video-game consoles.
</P>
<P>
   They also feature a card-trading area and a chance for players
to become (drumroll, please) Pokemon master trainers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this summer, when the 19-city training tour rolled to
the Mall of America in Minneapolis, it was a big hit _ 44,000
people showed up. (Music's 'N Sync and Shania Twain only drew
20,000 each in concerts!)
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon _ short for ``pocket monsters'' _ began in the mid-1990s
in Japan as a video game from Nintendo. In the game, a player
captures, nurtures or improves 150 different kinds of Pokemon
creatures that have Harry Potter-ish sounding names (Pikachu or
Paras, anyone?).
</P>
<P>
   The Pokemon are divided into different types _ including
``fire,'' ``water'' or ``ground.'' Depending on their type, some
Pokemon creatures are more suited to kick the Poke-butt of another.
</P>
<P>
   In both the video and trading-card versions of the game, players
seek to get as many Pokemon as they can _ thus the motto ``gotta
catch 'em all.''
</P>
<P>
   But because some video cartridges _ as well as card sets _ have
a specified number of premium characters, some Pokemon are harder
to get. So players must interact with other players, igniting
feverish swapping.
</P>
<P>
   When Pokemon came to the United States, it arrived first as a
cartoon show in 1998. Then it moved into card games, video games
and other areas _ fanned by companies with licensing agreements to
issue Pokemon products.
</P>
<P>
   Savvy marketing has worked like a dream: The TV show introduced
characters, which piqued interest in the video game, which in turn
set the tables for the trading cards.
</P>
<P>
   This year alone, Pokemon products are projected to generate $700
million in U.S. retail sales.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest licensing companies is Wizards of the Coast
Inc., a Renton, Wash.-based company that publishes trading/game
cards. The company has sold more than 2 millon of the two-player
starter sets since their release in January 1999, and has been
pressed by high demands.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone thinks Pokemon is grand. Reports have
crisscrossed the country of school kids getting Pokemon cards
stolen; trading cards instead of doing homework; pressing parents
for Pokemon purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Kate said at her school, University Child Development School,
teachers issued a no-card rule after kids who had them made kids
who did not feel left out on the playground.
</P>
<P>
   ``But people still talk about the cards,'' Kate says.
</P>
<P>
   Kate _ who is a big Beanie Baby collector and has taken part in
a girl youth ski group called Chicks on Stix ( the``X'' represents
crossed skis) _ likes Pikachu because he is cute and packs a punch
_ a tiny shock that stuns other Pokemon characters. She cracks up
just talking about it.
</P>
<P>
   But some lawyers have serious problems with Pokemon.
</P>
<P>
   In federal court in San Diego last month, attorneys filed a suit
on behalf of four parents who allege Pokemon trading cards promote
a form of illegal gambling. That's because only through chance can
players get the premium cards randomly inserted in packs, the
lawyers contend.
</P>
<P>
   The suit said wrapping on the card packs put the odds of getting
a premium card at 1 in 33; the premium cards have a resale value of
more than $70 each, compared to $3 to $10 for an unopened pack of
11 cards, the suit said.
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo attorneys said similar suits have been filed against
sports trading-card makers, without success.
</P>
<P>
   Kids, however, aren't sweating it. And Pokemon popularity is
growing.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Zyduck started watching Pokemon on TV after he heard a
news story about flashing lights in a Pokemon cartoon had sent
schoolchildren in Japan to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``So naturally, this piqued my curiosity,'' he wrote on the
Internet. ``But it's been strangely addicting. I started watching
it before I had to go to school. ... Now I'm hooked. And strangely
enough, I found someone at school who watches that show, too. And
we're in high school, man. High school.''

   Leadership Training With a Stellar Professor &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brand names are well known to business school professors, but
only one professor is a brand name herself. Call her Professor
Oprah. Oprah Winfrey began her pedagogical career at the highest
levels on Tuesday, teaching a course in ``Dynamics of Leadership''
to second-year MBA students at Northwestern University's Kellogg
Graduate School of Management in Evanston, Ill. Actually, she is
the co-teacher, with her beau, the marketing consultant Stedman
Graham.
</P>
<P>
   While ``The Oprah Winfrey Show'' itself has turned from
celebrities to spiritualism, with ``gratitude journals'' and ways
to ``remember your spirit,'' the 110 students in course G26 got
down to cases in the first session _ starting with Katharine Graham
and the Washington Post Co.
</P>
<P>
   The host of the ``change your life'' television talk show is her
own case study in entrepreneurial dynamism: Actress. Book promoter.
Movie producer. Charity organizer. And publisher of a new, as yet
unnamed Hearst Magazines title.
</P>
<P>
   Security was tight. The university urged students not to divulge
even the course syllabus, though it is available for purchase at
the student bookstore. It promises that students will ``increase
their capacity to enhance their performance potential,'' ``improve
self-awareness'' and ``develop a detailed plan to turn vision into
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I take it very seriously,'' the professor said on her way into
class with Graham, ``because both of us care very much about
leadership in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere Mrs. Duncan, my fourth grade teacher, is very happy
today,'' she added. &QL;

   Partners at Baker &AMP; McKenzie, which with 2,400 lawyers is
America's largest law firm, will vote this week to elect a new
chairman. Only one lawyer, Christine Lagarde, has been nominated
for the job of managing the firm, based in Chicago but with offices
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   If Ms. Lagarde is elected, she will become the first woman to
lead any of the 20 largest law firms in the nation. Insiders say
her election is virtually a done deal. &QL;

   Criticism on a Different Runway &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, Ralph Lauren learned that his sense of fashion
doesn't please quite everyone. He had entered one of his cars, a
black 1938 Bugatti 57SC Atlantic, in the Louis Vuitton Classic, an
annual concours d'elegance, or beauty pageant for antique cars, at
Rockefeller Center. One of only four of its type ever made, this
Bugatti has a magnesium alloy body so difficult to weld that it is
held together by a prominent riveted spine. It's the Batmobile's
sinister older brother.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren was there on Saturday to show off his car _ call it the
Polomobile _ which, like others in his collection, has served as a
prop in his advertisements. He was absent on Sunday, attending a
sister's birthday party, when the Bugatti was proclaimed best of
show. Poised to roll down a street converted to a carpeted runway
to receive a trophy, however, it wouldn't start.
</P>
<P>
   Once it did get rumbling, the jury chairman, Murray Livingstone
Smith, a partner in Bozell Worldwide, responded like an automotive
fashion critic. Noting that the car was not black before Lauren
bought it, he loudly appealed for a return to the original color,
saying ``Please. Paint it blue.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to Smith's appeal, a Lauren spokeswoman laughed,
saying: ``You're serious? And it still won best of show?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Staying in Toyland &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When your own house is on fire, it's no time to be lingering
down the block at the neighbors'. And so Jill E. Barad, chief
executive of Mattel, said last week that she would not seek
re-election to the Microsoft board, which she joined in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when corporate boards strive for diversity, her
departure would leave the Microsoft board without a woman. The
board, relatively small with just six members left, has no plans to
add others.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel's stock slid on Friday, reaching its lowest level since
1995. The stock has slumped as children have set aside their Barbie
dolls and other Mattel toys in favor of computers and electronic
games.

 By LESLIE EATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Despite everything you may have heard about
millennium madness, out-of-towners have not booked every overpriced
hotel room in the city for New Year's Eve. They have not snapped up
every $3,000 seat in the Rainbow Room, purchased every $1,000
ticket to every ``gala'' event, hired every limousine _ or even
every baby sitter.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, despite all the hype, the puff, the ``reserve now or
you'll be ringing out the 20th century in Scranton'' threats,
bookings for the New Year's holiday have been slow. And there is at
least the possibility that for hoteliers, restaurateurs and
impresarios, the party to end this or any other century may turn
out to be a bit of a bust.
</P>
<P>
   Not a total bomb, of course. Reservations at hotels and
restaurants are still ahead of where they would be in a normal
year, and travel and tourism officials express confidence that
everything will be booked by the big night. A few events, like a
dinner at the American Museum of Natural History, have sold out.
But New Year's Eve has not, so far, been the blowout many expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's concern that it's not as strong as it was anticipated
to be,'' said one longtime hotel manager, who predicts that hotels
will start offering better deals in the weeks before New Year's
Eve.
</P>
<P>
   A new survey by the agency that oversees the city's tourism
efforts, NYC &AMP; Co., finds that three-quarters of the 40 hotels that
responded are not yet fully booked. Cristyne F. Lategano, on her
first day as president of the agency, said that many people are
only now beginning to nail down their plans for New Year's Eve,
adding, ``We expect this to be the greatest party ever thrown.''
</P>
<P>
   While most hotels are reluctant to reveal exactly how much (or
how little) of their space has been spoken for, the Hotel
Association of New York City says that ``most'' of its 158 members
are at least half full. A spot check of Manhattan hotels found
rooms available all over, even near Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   At the New York Hilton on Sixth Avenue at 53rd Street, rooms
start at $550 a night, about double the usual minimum charge. The
Waldorf-Astoria has rooms starting at $695 a night and $1,075
suites big enough for a private party (room service is extra). Even
the Marriott Marquis, which overlooks Times Square and received its
first request for a 1999 New Year's Eve reservation back in 1983,
just had some rooms open up after a group canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Sherpick of Baltimore was pleasantly surprised to find that
she could get a room at the Hilton _ she recently booked three, and
is bringing her husband's family from San Francisco. ``I think
we're a little crazy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations were clearly inflated at the Millennium Hotel on
44th Street. The hotel's management tried _ and failed _ to rent
the whole building to a single party giver. ``It's not inexpensive
to do, and nobody really had the budget for that,'' said Michael
Littler, vice president and general manager of the hotel. It still
has ``several handfuls'' of rooms available for New Year's Eve, at
prices of $695 a night for three nights; for a room with the view
of Times Square, add at least $150 a night.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are the hotels alone. Steven Leber, a theatrical producer
who hopes to lure 25,000 people to a $1,000 a head bash at the
Javits Center, reports that tickets are still available. ``The
scuttlebutt is that we're doing badly,'' he confided, but he said
that is not so though he will not reveal how many tickets have been
sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found people are just waiting longer than expected'' to
make their plans, Leber said, adding that many balked at hotels'
high rates and four-day minimum stays. So he has arranged for some
one-night-only rooms at $500. And he plans to step up the
advertising for the event, Celebration 2000, emphasizing all of its
wonders: performances by Sting, Aretha Franklin and Tom Jones, a
disco room, a big band room, and a menu created by Jean-Georges
Vongerichten. ``People are either going to say that I must be a nut
job,'' Leber said, ``or that this is the most fun thing ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Many restaurants, from the elegant Union Square Cafe to the
boisterous Virgil's Real BBQ on 44th Street, are planning to close
that night. But others are still accepting reservations for
extravagant meals; the River Cafe, for example, has a multicourse
dinner for $2,500 a person.
</P>
<P>
   At Millennium Limousine Service, cars are still available,
though the minimum rental is for 10 hours, and there is ``nothing
for less than $900,'' said Brian Plaine, the owner, who plans to
have 30 cars on the road by year-end. ``Everybody increased the
prices so outrageously, people are waiting for the best deal,''
Paine said. (He'd like to have a party, himself, he said, ``but
I'll probably be sitting in my office, pulling my hair out.'')
</P>
<P>
   Things have been busy at the Baby Sitters Guild, which provides
sitters for hotels and individual families. People have been
reserving child care since April, said Heidi Davalos, who used the
service for her own children before going to work there. Sitters
are still available, though the price is steep: $250, in advance,
for five hours, and about $30 an hour thereafter. ``It's going to
be a rough holiday,'' Ms. Davalos said. ``If you want people to
work, you have to offer them something mildly attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside of New York, Carnival Cruise Lines has hundreds of
cabins still available on a dozen millennial cruises in the
Caribbean and other points south. It turns out that most of the
trips were too long, said Jennifer de la Cruz, a spokeswoman for
Carnival. ``Most people have a limited amount of time.'' (Ms. de la
Cruz is planning to spend her New Year's Eve quietly with friends,
she said, though some of her siblings plan to travel.)
</P>
<P>
   A lack of vacation time and outrage over high prices were two of
the main reasons that 90 percent of Americans plan to stay put at
New Year's, according to a survey by Travel Weekly, a publication
for travel agents.
</P>
<P>
   And when people say they plan to stay at home, they literally
mean at home, according to a survey of more than 10,000 people done
by the Zagat restaurant-rating empire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventy percent said they wanted to be at home with friends
and family, which is the way I feel,'' said Tim Zagat, co-publisher
of the restaurant guides and chairman of NYC &AMP; Co., the city's
tourism agency. ``I probably shouldn't say this,'' Zagat said,
``but I want to be as far away from the city as possible and home
with my family.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who do want to go out on New Year's Eve want to be
somewhere extraordinary, like on top of Mount Everest, Zagat said.
</P>
<P>
   And for such people, believe it or not, New York City may not be
exotic enough. Take Margaret Barry, who works for the University of
Notre Dame in South Bend, Ind., but travels every chance she gets
to New York, where she worked for nine years. She considered
returning to the city for the big celebration, she said, ``But I
wanted to do something really different.'' Her New Year's Eve
destination: Warsaw.
</P>
<P>
   Even if some of the city's 55,000 hotel rooms remain vacant on
New Year's Eve, Times Square is unlikely to be noticeably empty
when the big ball drops. The crowd that traditionally attends tends
to be younger than the group that can afford to plunk down
thousands of dollars on hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   And while many New Yorkers say being in Times Square at midnight
has all the allure of riding the Lexington Avenue local _ only
colder _ in the past city dwellers have made up only about 15
percent of the crowd, according to a study done several years ago
by the Times Square Business Improvement District, which sponsors
the ball-drop and attendant hoopla. Most of the revelers come from
the tri-state region, and many are college students whose schools
are closed.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Times Square BID expects more than 1 million
people to attend at least some of the festivities, which begin at
6:30 a.m. on Dec. 31. At that early, chilly hour, ``it's not like
at midnight, but there will be a substantial crowd there,'' said
Peter Kohlmann, the executive producer of the event, who will spend
New Year's Eve in Times Square between 45th and 46th streets,
``watching everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the crowds have become increasingly well-behaved _ and
sober _ in recent years, the very idea of being packed in with a
million revelers may be a turn-off even to those most likely to
attend.
</P>
<P>
   Isa Ferguson, a 20-year-old college student living in Brooklyn,
would seem to be a likely candidate, given that she does not have
much money, but does not want to stay home. ``I keep thinking that
when my kids are asking me what did I do, I don't want to say,
`Well, I played Monopoly.'''
</P>
<P>
   So is she going to Times Square? ``Yeah, right,'' she said. ``I
don't think I want to be out,'' she added, confessing to a sneaking
suspicion that the so-called Y2K computer problem may really cause
at least limited problems when midnight rolls around.
</P>
<P>
   Even more sotto voce, some New Yorkers confess to a worry that
terrorists, publicity seekers or plain old nuts might think Times
Square on New Year's Eve is the perfect place to make an explosive
splash, as hundreds of millions of people watch on television.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials are reassuring: ``It will be business
as usual for us, because we are always in aggressive mode,
anyway,'' said Joseph Valiquette, a spokesman for the Federal
Bureau of Investigation. As for what he'll be doing, ``I guess I'll
be home,'' he said, ``I don't have any plans.''
</P>
<P>
   The high expenses that may keep some tourists out of the city
will also keep some New Yorkers home. Christine Kulisek, a
packaging designer, had planned to go to Mexico for the millennium,
but sky-high air fares changed her mind. Now she plans to have a
small black-tie dinner with friends and ``enjoy the Manhattan
festivities.''
</P>
<P>
   Does she plan to stop by Times Square? ``Oh no, I'll watch it on
TV,'' Ms. Kulisek said. ``Everybody there will be from out of town.
I don't think anyone from Manhattan will be anywhere near Times
Square, I really don't.''

CLINTON ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS WILL MEET WTO CRITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House will invite critics of the World
Trade Organization to meet with high-ranking Clinton administration
officials this month, and President Clinton is hoping to make a
major speech defending his trade policy before this fall's meeting
of the World Trade Organization in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings and the speech were promised in a letter from U.S.
Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky to Sen. Patty Murray,
D-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, which Murray released to the news media Friday, was
dated Thursday, and followed news reports about a previously
unanswered Aug. 5 letter from Murray to Clinton in which the
senator suggested that the president needs to do more to reach out
to labor and environmentalists concerned about the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Barshefksy, who said she was asked by Clinton to respond, wrote,
``I want to assure you that the White House and USTR (the U.S.
Trade Representative's office) are actively working with labor,
environmental, consumer and other non-governmental organizations
that have concerns regarding the WTO.''
</P>
<P>
   Barshefsky said that during the past six months, her office has
``consulted extensively'' with such organizations about the U.S.
agenda for the ministerial meeting in Seattle, which is scheduled
to run from Nov. 30 through Dec. 3. And, she said, ``these
consultations will continue during October as many of these groups
will be invited to the White House to meet with senior-level
Administration officials for comment on our Seattle proposals.''
</P>
<P>
   Barshefsky said the meeting in Seattle will be more open than
any previous WTO meeting. She cited the WTO's decision to agree to
a U.S. request for a symposium in Seattle Nov. 29 at which groups
with concerns about the WTO will be invited to address the world's
trade ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, who has been concerned by reports of potentially
disruptive protests planned by critics of the WTO, had urged
Clinton to make a speech to the nation defending global trade. In
response to that request, Barshefsky wrote ``the White House is
looking for an appropriate opportunity for him to deliver such a
speech.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barshefsky also pointed to several comments Clinton has
already made this summer pledging to support trade agreements that
``enhance labor standards and environmental protection all across
the world,'' as he said in a speech in Chicago in June.
</P>
<P>
   Murray said she was pleased by the letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between now and the ministerial, we will see a concerted
effort by the administration to promote U.S. and Washington state
trade interests,'' she said. ``The administration is also stepping
up its efforts to work with the labor and environmental
communities. This is very encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor and environmental groups, long critical of the World Trade
Organization for paying too little attention to global working and
environmental conditions, have become increasingly critical of the
Clinton administration for not pushing more aggressively to make
sure that trade agreements don't harm workers or the environment.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference this week, five major environmental groups
said that the Administration's trade agenda has not matched
Clinton's rhetoric, and called on the Administration to alter its
agenda for the Seattle meeting to give a higher priority to
evaluating how trade agreements affect the environment. Labor
leaders want the administration to push for greater enforcement of
agreements by WTO members to allow workers around the world to
unionize and to prohibit child labor.
</P>
<P>
   Some opponents of WTO said they were still not satisfied when
told of the letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Access is not the same thing as influence,'' said Daniel
Seligman, responsible trade program director at the Sierra Club.
``While the U.S. Trade Representative has been talking to the
environmental community, there's precious little indication that
their approach to the summit has changed at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Barshefsky's office did not return a call to discuss the letter.

SOME U.S. PLANTS VULNERABLE TO NUCLEAR MISHAP LIKE JAPAN'S
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., R.I., N.M., Idaho, Wash., Tenn.)   (See also JAPAN-NUKE) 
(bl) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Friday told the Energy and
Defense departments to review the safety of civilian nuclear fuel
processing, but experts inside and outside government said that the
Energy Department itself owns the plants that are most vulnerable
to an accidental chain reaction like the one in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The only commercial plant in the United States to ever
experience such a reaction was in Charlestown, R.I., in 1964. But
the Energy Department and its predecessor agency, the Atomic Energy
Commission, suffered six such reactions from 1958 to 1978,
including three at the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant, near Idaho
Springs, Idaho, one at the Y-12 plant, near Oak Ridge, Tenn., one
at Hanford, near Richland, Wash., and one at Los Alamos, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Five people died in those incidents, in which uranium or
plutonium was accidentally assembled into a critical mass, starting
a chain reaction that created a shower of radiation.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Energy Department, there have been a total of
21 inadvertent ``criticalities'' in the United States, the Soviet
Union and Britain, of which 20 involved nuclear materials in liquid
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a statement, said, ``We've been providing
information to Japan on our experiences in dealing with similar
incidents in the United States, and making available our experts in
atmospheric monitoring and any other areas that might be useful.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the seven commercial plants licensed by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission process uranium that is 3 percent to 5
percent U-235, the type that sustains a chain reaction. The
accident in Japan involved a mixture enriched to 19 percent U-235,
meaning a smaller volume would suffice for a chain reaction.
</P>
<P>
   One commercial plant, in Lynchburg, Va., owned by Framatome
Cogema Fuels, handles uranium that is more than 90 percent U-235,
for naval propulsion reactors.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, the uranium solutions used in the United States
are a different chemistry from the mixture in Japan, but a critical
mass can occur with any of a variety of different chemical
mixtures. But in the United States the commercial plants have an
advantage because they perform the same activities over and over,
experts said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Energy Department, Dr. David Michaels, the assistant
secretary of energy for environment, safety and health, said the
weapons program once had that benefit, when it was in steady
production. ``We recognize this overall vulnerability, going from
doing the same thing every day in the production operation, to
cleanup, which is a more dynamic activity,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Now the department is trying to clean out tanks that have been
sitting for months or years, with materials whose volume, content
or concentration must be carefully measured and calculated.
</P>
<P>
   Liquids are the most prone to flow into containers where they
will assume a shape and volume that can support a chain reaction,
as happened in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Department officials acknowledge that over time, their ability
to deal with the problem has declined. A government panel of
independent experts chartered by Congress to advise on the safety
of the Energy Department's weapons production process, the Defense
Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, said in a recommendation in May
1997, that at many Energy Department plants, ``The typical
criticality safety staff consists mainly of individuals who have no
prior first-hand experience in criticality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They lack background in neutron physics on a fundamental
level, and are not familiar with work on assembles near a critical
state, activities that would foster intuitive approaches to
criticality control,'' said the report, which was written as the
department was considering closing its last criticality safety
training laboratory, as a cost-saving measure. The department kept
it open, but board members are still concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Herbert J.C. Kouts, a member of the board and former senior
scientist at Brookhaven National Laboratory, in Upton, N.Y., said
in a speech in August that two of the accidents, one at Los Alamos
National Laboratory and the other in Rhode Island, ``occurred
during cleanup of waste containing fissile material, an activity
that is now taking place at a number of the facilities for the
Department of Energy.''
</P>
<P>
   And while the public once accepted occasional nuclear mishaps,
Kouts said, ``in the most general way, a criticality accident is
now a complete no-no.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Kouts said, making the rules stricter to avoid criticality
problems is not itself the answer, because workers may happen to
break rules without causing an accident, and then ``develop a
contempt for the limits.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a special problem with ``orphan material,'' which is
nuclear material left over from experiments or projects from years
ago, said Robert Alvarez, a former senior advisor to the energy
secretary. Much of the department's clean-up work is driven by
agreements with state governments, he said, and if the orphan
material is not covered in such an agreement, it is often
neglected.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, ``criticality safety is rapidly atrophying
for lack of priority attention, because the front office doesn't
understand that this is one of the things that makes up the heart
and soul of nuclear safety.''
</P>
<P>
   But department officials said that they have intermittently shut
down plants for months at a time when they have found criticality
problems, and they recently discovered that they have ordered a
cumulative total of seven and a half years of shutdowns since 1994.
Partly for that reason, they organized the workshop at which Kouts
spoke in August.
</P>
<P>
   At the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which licenses the seven
commercial nuclear fuel processing plants, spokeswoman Sue Gagner
said, ``Right now, we have not instituted any changes.'' The NRC
inspects each plant twice yearly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We require that they have at least two safety measures to
prevent criticality,'' she said. These could include such
precautions as regulating the size or shape of containers to
configurations that could not support criticality.

CHRISTIANS JOIN JEWS IN FESTIVAL OF SUCCOTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ With parades and prayer services, some 5,000
evangelical Christian pilgrims descended on the Holy City this week
to take part in the Jewish harvest festival of Succoth.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian visitors _ mostly from America and Europe _ are
part of a growing fringe evangelical movement that embraces a
militant belief in Zionism and sees a biblical connection between
the emergence of a strong Israeli state and the Second Coming of
Christ.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian believers were easy to pick out among the usual
tourists and throngs of Jewish worshipers gathering for prayers at
the Western Wall. They were the ones wearing pendants with a
Christian cross in the center of a Star of David. One group had
T-shirts that read ``Oklahoma is for Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   The group began gathering in the desert a week ago at Ein Gedi,
80 miles southeast of Jerusalem, under the full moon that marked
the beginning of Succoth, or the Feast of Tabernacles. On Tuesday,
Christian representatives from more than 100 nations joined
thousands of Israelis in a ``Unity of Jerusalem'' march in an
annual parade to affirm Jews' ancient claim to the city.
</P>
<P>
   To the bemusement of many Israelis, the Christian marchers
passed along the ancient Herodian walls of the Old City in various
forms of traditional dress _ from Native Americans in fringed
buckskin and leather shields emblazoned with the Star of David to
natives of Tahiti in grass skirts.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian evangelicals' presence at the march is nothing
new. This is the 20th year that the International Christian Embassy
of Jerusalem has organized the pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that God gave this land to the Jews, and that their
ingathering here will bring about the return of our Lord, and that
that time is at hand,'' said Geraldine Kendall, 69, of Tampa, Fla.,
as she prepared for the final prayer vigil lastnight to mark the
end of the feast.
</P>
<P>
   In the 20 years it has been operating in Israel, the Christian
Embassy has flourished into a political force, with some 70
employees, foreign offices, and an $8 million annual budget, about
half from contributions by American evangelicals.
</P>
<P>
   The group's Washington office has become known as a political
lobbying group for Israel's rightist Likud Party and has worked
tirelessly in support of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and
Gaza and on the campaign to move the American Embassy from Tel Aviv
to Jerusalem. The Christian Embassy has also been a fierce critic
of the underlying premise of the Mideast peace process, under which
Israel would cede land captured in 1967 to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Ehud Olmert, Jerusalem's mayor and a leader of Likud, praised
the visitors as ``the most wonderful guests that this city has.''
</P>
<P>
   In past years, the group was fawned over by former Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Likud, who delivered thundering
speeches at its gatherings. But this year, newly elected Prime
Minister Ehud Barak of the more liberal Labor Party declined an
invitation to speak, which the organizers saw as a deliberate snub.
</P>
<P>
   The group's assiduous support of Israel grows out of a
fundamentalist belief that the ``ingathering'' of Jews in Israel
will prepare the way for the the Second Coming and Judgment Day.
Their rhetoric is often apocalyptic, and many speakers at a series
of seminars in Jerusalem demonized the Arab population.
</P>
<P>
   One, Gary Cooperberg, an Israeli who led a tour of his militant
settlement of Kiryat Arba, went so far as to tell the audience that
if Palestinians threw stones at his car he would shoot to kill
them.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of this largely Western group of Christian
evangelicals and their zealous support of Jewish settlements in the
West Bank and of extreme rightist views in Israel is not welcomed
by the indigenous Palestinian Christian population. The Palestinian
Christians deeply resent the evangelicals claiming to represent
``the Christian community'' in support of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Naim Ateek, a Palestinian Christian leader and theologian
who was uprooted from his home in the 1948 Israeli-Arab war, said
he was annoyed that the group did not seek out the views of local
Palestinians or bother to hear how Palestinian Christian
communities, which he said date back 2,000 years, have ``suffered
under Israeli occupation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it seems as if they are reading a different Bible,
twisting scripture to fit their own jigsaw puzzle,'' he said.
``They are not for the peace process, which seems unbelievable to
me, since the central focus of the Christian faith is to work for
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   David Parsons, the organizer of the event and a spokesman for
the International Christian Embassy of Jerusalem, said the
Christian presence for the feast had a ``special prophetic
significance.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited Old Testament passages from prophet Zechariah in which
God promises to ``gather all nations against Jerusalem'' and to
usher in the messiah and a final day of judgment.

BACON EXHIBIT SIZZLES WITH CONTROVERSY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDREW MARTON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Someone once intoned that the first casualty of war is truth.
Rejiggering that sentiment, one might now warn that the primary
loss in an arts controversy is the art.
</P>
<P>
   When the Fort Worth school district, responding to parental
complaints, canceled elementary and middle school field trips to
the Modern Art Museum's Francis Bacon exhibit in September, there
was breathless talk of the show's homosexual references, its
displays of frontal nudity and its being ``emotionally charged''
and not ``age-appropriate.'' There were reports of students seeing
the exhibit and suffering sleepness nights, their heads filled with
nagging questions.
</P>
<P>
   Those accounts only make clear that the Bacon exhibition did its
job of stimulating emotion and provoking debate. What the
field-trip cancellations achieved was to link the exhibit to such
perennial hot-button issues as policing of museums (a distant
cousin of censorship), the effects of art on fragile young psyches,
and how discriminating schools should be when exposing students to
art that isn't predictably classical.
</P>
<P>
   For the Modern Art Museum, this little dust-up is too
reminiscent of a previous flap. A year ago, some schools nixed
student tours of the museum exhibit ``Self-Taught Artists of the
20th Century: An American Anthology,'' outraged over its depictions
of copulation and hermaphroditic imagery. Currently, a moralistic
crusade against scrofulous art is under way in that bastion of
cultural openness, New York. Gotham Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has
threatened to shut the spigot on $7 million in city contributions
to the Brooklyn Museum of Art unless it cancels the opening of the
Saatchi collection of young British artists. That exhibition
features a shark suspended in formaldehyde and a portrait of the
Virgin Mary adorned with elephant feces.
</P>
<P>
   Now whether the marriage of elephant excrement to religious
subjects is art at all must be open for debate. Such heated
discourse should mark any society encouraging freedom of
expression. But financial blackmail of a museum, or the
</P>
<P>
   barring of fifth-grade schoolchildren from viewing an art
exhibit during a school-sponsored event _ especially when many
parents didn't agree with the decision _ inflicts a black eye on
any open-minded society.
</P>
<P>
   But what has been lost amid all the high-dudgeon indignation
over what children should see is exactly what it is they actually
experience at an art exhibit. The Francis Bacon show offers a
selection of his surreal and, yes, nihilistic, excursions into
various worlds. But what an eclectic world tour he leads, careening
from an imperious pope to an inscrutable Sphinx in Egypt, to the
wind-whipped fields of southern France or an elephant lolling in a
South African marsh. These are cultural postcards that any
land-locked 12-year-old could benefit from.
</P>
<P>
   As for Bacon's color choices, many of the exhibition's
detractors chose to fixate on his use of the blood-red often used
to paint, well, blood. But this is a cheap shot because it ignores
the enormous palette Bacon worked in, employing everything from
burnt umber to the lavender of a Vatican robe. There is sun-kissed
orange for Bacon's loving study of van Gogh or lemon-zest for his
cubist take on painter Lucian Freud.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Bacon did relish the more saturnine shades of pewter
gray and cobalt blue when doing his self-portraits, but those tints
are not more sinister than the somber clothes favored by any number
of youngsters and goth-inspired Bohemians. In fact, Bacon's color
and thematic choices owe much to Halloween and Grimm's Fairy Tales
by way of Salvador Dali, Andy Warhol, Diego Velazquez and Jean
Auguste Dominique Ingres. Last time anyone checked, no one was
prohibiting children from experiencing those great masters.
</P>
<P>
   And it isn't legislated anywhere that children should avert
their eyes from Bacon's favored territory: painterly expressions of
angst and melancholy, the baleful moments in a non-Disneyfied life.
No parent should fear their children departing on momentary trips
into somber artistic country and returning to decipher them
afterward. Kids are making these mind-expanding journeys every day
by watching television and surfing the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Certain parents objected most vociferously to their children
viewing some of Francis Bacon's nudes. True, in an exhibition
spanning more than 50 works, approximately 5 or 10 percent involve
nudity. But those are not photo-realistic portraits, but amorphous,
Henry Moore-like forms, bulbous relatives to Picasso's cubist
renditions. Bacon's nudes are either blurry (''Study for a Nude'')
or sketchy outlines (''Reclining Figure,'' where splayed legs
reveal a smudge of color suggesting either genitalia or a fig
leaf.)
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, some fifth-graders confessed that several of
Bacon's nudes made them feel as if their bodies were ugly. That
echoes how most adolescent girls feel looking at the anorexic
supermodels in ``Vogue.'' Again, no school has barred kids from
those fashion magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The Bacon exhibit also repelled some parents with its wall-text
descriptions of the homosexual relationship between Bacon and
George Dyer. How ironic that the paintings of Dyer are models of
prissy decorum. ``Portrait of George Dyer Talking'' and ``Study of
George Dyer'' aren't smutty body worship but show a man with primly
crossed legs. Within the catalog of homoerotic art, with
Michelangelo's ``David'' as its paradigm icon, Bacon's work is
extremely tame.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a shame if the balanced and invigorating Bacon
exhibit should be bruised by the Fort Worth school boycott. To
cordon off youngsters from an exhibit of one of the acknowledged
masters of 20th-century surrealism is, at best, a misguided attempt
to circumscribe the cultural intake of preteens. And that can only
hamper their ability to absorb, comprehend, and, yes, savor the
unsettling nature of good art.

NICOL BEGINS REVOLUTION RESCUE MISSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Before this season, Walter Zenga had been
the symbol of Revolution success. But lately Zenga has been
associated with the team's failure.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution almost completely collapsed in the second half of
the MLS season, and Zenga could not save them either as player or
coach. Now, the job has been given to Scotsman Steve Nicol, who
will guide the Revolution against the MetroStars in the final home
game of the regular season Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Nicol, a former star with Liverpool in England, has been in
Boston since April, when he arrived to be a player-assistant coach
for the Bulldogs in the A League. Nicol played for the Bulldogs in
a 2-1 exhibition loss to the Revolution in Framingham May 5 and has
been observing the Revs most of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem is that they haven't played as a team,''
Nicol said after conducting his first practice Friday.
``Individually, the players can play with any team in the league,
but they've fallen down when it comes to team play. We need to
harness that individual talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``A coach has to come up with new ways, new ideas, give pointers
to show a team that's the way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Nicol has high-level credentials as a player and has
performed for extremely prominent teams in Europe, he has kept a
low profile. Nicol's speech is economic and he has remained in the
background since arriving in the United States. Nicol succeeded
John Kerr as player-coach of the Bulldogs for the final two games
of the season, both losses.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Zenga was always the center of attention, leading
the Revolution to their only playoff berth as a goalkeeper in 1997
and regularly in conflicts with fans, the press, and referees as a
player-coach this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad to be working with the players the Revolution have,''
Nicol said. ``I hope I can pass something on to them for the last
two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I will be here next year. I can't look that
far ahead, but if this team makes the playoffs anything can happen.
I came here in April and I've enjoyed it, and hopefully I will be
here longer than a year. Obviously, I was surprised by this. I
wasn't expecting it. It's a nice surprise, but unfortunate that
this situation has arisen.''
</P>
<P>
   General manager Brian O'Donovan said no decisions have been made
for next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an audition, that would be unfair,'' O'Donovan
said. ``Steve is here to help us out. He was effectively the coach
of our second team. We will discuss next year at the end of this
season. But right now that is absolutely the furthest thing from
our minds. We need to get through these next two games and try to
get into the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenga's dismissal was precipitated by a request from his agent,
Eric Manasse, to renew his contract for next season. O'Donovan said
he would wait until the end of the regular season to make a
decision and denied having negotiated with Nicol before Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Some Revolution players joined Nicol with the Bulldogs during
the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bulldogs were a very organized group and that's what we
need,'' midfielder Paulo Dos Santos said. ``He was able to motivate
players with the Bulldogs, and that is a key for us. There could be
just a little change that makes a big difference. Hopefully, we can
turn things around, but that's up to the players.''
</P>
<P>
   Said John Harkes, who played against Nicol in England: ``He was
a quality player and a nice person. We can only find out how good a
coach he is in time. We can't change what happened and we can only
live in the present. The best thing for us is to stay together as a
team and lift our spirits because the MetroStars are going to come
in pumped up.''

TWO DECENT TEAMS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE MIDDLE AMERICA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oxford, Ohio, home of Miami Univeristy, is known as being the
``cradle of coaches.'' Today, it's the center of the mid-major
football universe. The buzz is loud, the traffic will be snarled _
and not just because it's Parents' Weekend and John Cougar
Mellencamp is in concert.
</P>
<P>
   The Mid-American Conference has a showcase game in No. 17
Marshall (4-0) and Miami (3-1). The Thundering Herd attack is keyed
by senior quarterback Chad Pennington. The RedHawks' upset hopes
are carried by senior running back Travis Prentice. Both are
long-shot Heisman Trophy candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real excitement and energy surrounding this game,''
said MAC commissioner Rick Chryst, a former assistant commissioner
in the Atlantic Coast and Southwest conferences. ``There are some
pretty high stakes on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there's a melancholy aspect. Both Marshall and
Miami are in the MAC's East Division. The winner can shoot for
playing in the conference championship game for a place in the
Motor City Bowl, the MAC's only guaranteed bowl. The loser can
probably forget about the postseason. Last season, Miami finished
10-1 _ it's only loss coming to Marshall _ and did not gain a bowl
invitation.
</P>
<P>
   In basketball terms, today's game is similar to a conference
tournament championship game where the winner gets a spot in the
NCAA Tournament and the loser can start washing and packing
uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really not concerned about the top-25 rankings,'' said
Pennington, the nation's sixth-rated passer. ``We understand about
the only way to get to a bowl game is to win our conference. That
is what we're focused on. By no means are we taking this game
lightly. We understand what it is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   For Marshall, what it's all about is continuing a season that
could become magical _ and futile. Marshall could become this
season's Tulane, an undefeated team that winds up playing in an
also-ran bowl instead of for the national title. The Thundering
Herd cracked the top 25 on Sept. 20. At No. 17, they're about a
month ahead of Tulane's pace; the Green Wave was tied for No. 15
the first week of November last season.
</P>
<P>
   The MAC, like the Western Athletic, Mountain West and Conference
USA, are not part of the Bowl Championship Series. To even be
considered for a BCS at-large bowl, Marshall would need to finish
ranked 12th or higher in the final BCS rankings. Because of the
BCS' strength of schedule and computer rankings factors, not even a
miracle could push Marshall high enough in the BCS rankings _ No. 1
or No. 2 _ to play for a national title.
</P>
<P>
   ``People still perceive our conference as being inferior, but we
know that's not the case,'' Prentice said. ``We can go out and play
football and beat anybody. I mean football is football. It doesn't
matter what conference you come from.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the innocence of youth.
</P>
<P>
   Pennington and Prentice are each having solid senior seasons to
cap off excellent careers. Pennington, at 6-foot-4, 220-pound, has
passed for 8,155 yards in his career and thrown 74 touchdown
passes. Prentice, a 6-1, 228-pounder, has rushed for 4,445 yards
and scored 67 touchdowns. He needs nine rushing touchdowns to break
the career touchdown record held by Texas' Ricky Williams.
</P>
<P>
   A record crowd is expected at 30,000-seat Yager Stadium. ``USA
Today'', ``Sports Illustrated'' and ``ESPN Magazine'' will have
reporters and photographers on hand. There will be
loud-blazer-wearing representatives from the Motor City, Mobile and
Micron PC bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, it makes it more exciting to get all this press,''
said Prentice, who two years ago rushed for 203 yards and four
touchdowns in the RedHawks' 45-21 upset of Marshall, which then had
wide receiver Randy Moss. ``Everybody has their eyes on you. You
know people are paying attention. So you have to go out and have
your best ballgame. So, I like it. It's good for me, it's good for
my team and it's good for the conference, especially nationally.
It's good for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get caught up in all the hype. Because when you get
down to it, it's still football. You can't worry about the hype.
You have to win this game, first. It's about football, first.''

Safeguarding football's top trophy
Jared Newland has one of those dream jobs. He travels around the
country to the nation's top campuses and gets to watch each year's
best college football games, usually from the sidelines. Newland's
traveling companion on these trips is the 35-pound Sears Trophy
that is awarded to the No. 1 team as voted by the coaches' poll.
Think of him like the guys who escort the NHL's Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The Sears Trophy has been traveling around the country since
1993 and has been present for 45 games. Corporate Marketing
Associates, Newland's employer, targets nearly 10 games a year for
road trips. Thus far, Newland and the trophy have been at the
following games: Arizona-Penn State, Ohio State-Miami, Notre
Dame-Michigan, Georgia Tech-Florida State and Penn State-Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to pick out the games where there are
national-championship caliber teams,'' said Newland, who attended
Wyoming and worked in sports information there, at Tulsa, UT-San
Antonio and Utah State.
</P>
<P>
   For each trip, Newland ships the trophy _ which, with padded
carrying case, weighs in at 123 pounds _ via UPS. He shows up a few
days early in each town to display the trophy, squire it around to
television stations, etc. The football-shaped trophy is a frequent
set decoration on ESPN's ``GameDay''.
</P>
<P>
   There was some unexpected drama before the trophy's last road
trip. Newland shipped it from Tallahassee to Miami, but Hurricane
Floyd shut down UPS deliveries. When Newland arrived in Miami, he
couldn't locate the trophy in Miami at his hotel. He eventually
tracked it down after two hours of telephone conversations.
</P>
<P>
   The Sears Trophy, insured for more than $30,000, is a Waterford
crystal football that weighs 7] pounds and sits on a pedestal much
like a football tee. During games, it's displayed on the sidelines.
Newland keeps an eye on the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the players or the ball starts heading our way, I grab the
ball and head the other way,'' he said. ``Sometimes, the players
come over and look at it, touch it. Before the Arizona-Penn State
game, an Arizona lineman came over and touched it and then kissed
his fingers. Obviously, that didn't do his team much good.''
Stomping some grapes Last season, Wisconsin had 54 penalties for
423 yards. This season, the Badgers have 26 penalties for 241 yards
during a 2-2 start. Wisconsin coach Barry Alvarez called Big Ten
Conference supervisor of officials David Parry this week to discuss
his concerns about officiating.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a reason why we've led the league in least amount of
penalties for four years,'' Alvarez said. ``Then, all of a sudden,
we get a \Rlot of\S little touchy-feely penalties. Why, I don't
know. There are some that are obvious. But there are some that are
very questionable, too.''
</P>
<P>
   If it sounds like sour grapes and tastes like sour grapes, it's
sour grapes.
In quotes North Carolina quarterback Ronald Curry on the criticism
being leveled at coach Carl Torbush for the Tar Heels' 1-2 start:
</P>
<P>
   ``He's taking a lot of heat he shouldn't have to be taking. It's
not his fault. You can see who's out on the field making the plays.
It's not him; it's the players. We can talk all we want about
`we're going to do this; we can do that.' But a time comes when you
have to quit talking, put on your pants and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado senior cornerback Damen Wheeler on the Buffaloes'
second-half effort against Washington:
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second half they went straight at the belly of the
defense and were eating at us. I had to question our pride,
especially the second half. People were out there, but nobody was
making plays ... People stopped running to the ball _ just giving
up, I guess. No, I don't want to say giving up. But there's just no
excuse for how we played, no excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Purdue linebacker Mike Rose on today's game at No. 4 Michigan, a
team the Boilermakers haven't played in two years:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to finally say we can look forward to this Michigan
game ... To not play \RMichigan and Ohio State\S for two years,
everyone's kind of looked down on us and said, `Oh, yeah, you won
nine games, but you didn't play the big boys.' We're really looking
forward to showing everybody that we're for real.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA freshman quarterback Cory Paus on the sternum jacket he
doesn't want to wear to protect his bruised ribs:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a bulletproof vest. And it looks funny. If you don't
feel like you look good, you don't play good.''
By the numbers 1: Number of offensive touchdowns Southern
Mississippi allowed in consecutive losses to Big 12 teams Nebraska
and Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   4: Number of Texas teams ranked 100th or lower in scoring (out
of 114 Division I-A teams). Those teams are Baylor (101), Rice
(109), North Texas (110) and SMU (111). No other state has more
than one team ranked 100 to 114 in scoring.
</P>
<P>
   5: Misses by California on field goals in six attempts. All five
misses have hit one of the uprights.
</P>
<P>
   7: Number of pass plays by 5-0 Penn State that have covered at
least 47 yards. Last season, the Nittany Lions had just four pass
plays of that distance or greater.
</P>
<P>
   32-4: Florida State's record in games played when it was ranked
No. 1. The top-ranked Seminoles play 0-3 Duke today in
Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   25: Oregon State's losing streak against Southern California,
its opponent today. The Beavers' last victory over the Trojans came
in 1967, a 3-0 decision against the Trojans and junior running back
O.J. Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   34: Number of defensive touchdowns scored by Virginia Tech in
141 games under coach Frank Beamer.
</P>
<P>
   4 hours, 40 minutes The game time for the Southern
California-Oregon game Saturday. The Ducks won in triple overtime.
</P>
<P>
   0-5: Tommy Tuberville's record in the Mississippi-Auburn series.
While at Ole Miss, Tuberville was 0-4 against Auburn. He chalked up
another loss last week when his Tigers lost to the Rebels in
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   88-0: The aggregate score of New Mexico opponents in the third
quarter of the Lobos' past eight games.
Around the country Memphis can make the argument that it's the
nation's best 1-3 team. The Tigers' losses have been by a combined
seven points. And those three losses game to teams with a combined
record of 10-2 _ Mississippi State (4-0), Tennessee (3-1) and
Mississippi (3-1).
</P>
<P>
   East Carolina, displaced for a week because of flooding in North
Carolina, spent most of the $250,000 the school earned for its game
at South Carolina to cover its expenses for the unexpected extended
road trip. The school also had to pay North Carolina State about
$6,000 for damage caused by East Carolina fans to Carter-Finley
Stadium as they celebrated the Pirates' 27-23 upset of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   State College, Pa., home to Penn State, is acknowledged as one
of college football's toughest logistical road trips. Indiana's
trip last Saturday was one of the worst. After a 45-24 loss to the
Nittany Lions, the Hoosiers were stranded because their charter
plane had mechanical problems. There were no hotel vacancies, and
Indiana had checked out of its rooms. So, their hotel put up the
traveling party _ coaches, players, cheerleaders _ in two large
ballrooms.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina has the nation's longest losing streak at 14.
That's because Kent, Holtz's alma mater, won Saturday, ending its
16-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   As part of their lucrative contracts, coaches are often paid for
their time doing weekly television and radio shows. Sometimes, it
hardly seems worth the extra cash. On his call-in radio show this
week, LSU coach Gerry DiNardo heard from a disgruntled Tigers
``fan'' who asked if the coach needed help moving out of Baton
Rouge.
Short shots Short: Kansas State president Jon Wefald responded
(why?) to comments written by Will Leitch (who?) on ``The Sporting
News Online'' (what?) by ripping (in a letter posted on Kansas
State's Web site) the University of Texas and the state of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Shot: Another example of why not all adults should have access
to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Short: Tennessee is investigating possible academic fraud in its
football program involving other people doing work for players.
</P>
<P>
   Shot: Considering the school's graduation rates for football
players _ 57 percent, 11 percent, 25 percent _ in the past three
NCAA reports, the academic substitutes weren't exactly Rhodes
Scholars.
</P>
<P>
   Short: Colorado coach Gary Barnett's catch phrase to turn around
the Buffaloes was Return to Dominance (RTD).
</P>
<P>
   Shot: With the Buffs a disappointing 2-2, it turns out that RTD
might stand for Return to Durango. Barnett's first college coaching
job was at Fort Lewis College in Durango, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Short: Temple coach Bobby Wallace says, ``Offensively, we're
struggling about as bad as you can struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Shot: Wallace could be the coach at South Carolina. The
Gamecocks are last in the nation, averaging three points per game.
Wallace's Owls are next to last, averaging 3.8 per game.
</P>
<P>
   Short: Duke agreed to move today's ``home'' game with Florida
State to Jacksonville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Shot: To be fair, Florida State should agree to move this
season's ACC basketball home game with Duke to Charlotte.
Inside the numbers Air Force coach Fisher DeBerry recently became
the winningest coach in service academy history, passing Red Blaik.

FAMILIES HAVE DEEP ROOTS IN PANAMA CANAL ZONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
UNDATED:at Gorgas Hospital. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``They didn't have any work in Jamaica,'' Williams said. ``They
were very, very faithful to the old canal and the Americans, I
guess, because they got a job and living conditions were better.''
</P>
<P>
   Years later, Williams' father worked in the Canal Zone as a
paymaster. But Williams, who attended Panamanian schools and grew
up outside the zone, said he got a different perspective of canal
history and a sense of Panamanian nationalism that makes him
optimistic about the canal transition.
</P>
<P>
   The Canal Zone was like a country within Panama, with its own
jail, military and stores, Williams said. His grandparents were
loyal to the U.S. system in place, Williams said, but he questioned
the discrimination he noticed. For years, the neighborhoods were
segregated.
</P>
<P>
   In the early construction days, white Americans were paid in
gold and everyone else was paid in silver, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the difficult things to understand,'' said
Baquero, the canal museum director.
</P>
<P>
   Seabert Haynes, 80, lives in the Pedro Miguel neighborhood in
Panama, near the canal locks. He said his parents left Barbados
during the end of the construction period. In 1914, the family
resettled in the Canal Zone, where they were recruited to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are descendants of the West Indians who came to build the
canal,'' said Haynes, who is president of the National Association
of Retired Federal Employees of the United States. ``To me, it is
something that I don't think words can tell you. I feel we have
contributed so much to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard McConaughey, a Florida resident whose grandfather
traveled to Panama in 1906 to work on the passageway, also has deep
family roots at the canal. Four generations of McConaugheys have
labored for the canal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a McConaughey working the canal from the
beginning until the end. It's quite a feat,'' said McConaughey, 81,
who has a son who is a lockmaster for the canal.
</P>
<P>
   McConaughey was born in 1917 in Panama at Ancon Hospital, which
was later renamed after Col. William Gorgas, an American who helped
fight yellow fever and other diseases during construction of the
canal.
</P>
<P>
   McConaughey, a retired canal locomotive operator, said strong
friendships formed among workers who waited to pull ships through
the canal, and they got an unusual glimpse of the outside world.
McConaughey said he remembers goats, pigs and cattle en route to
Greece, and Egyptian workers drinking tea aboard English ships.
</P>
<P>
   The canal proved to be an important piece of the Muller family's
heritage, one that Walter Muller wanted to protect before he died
in June 1997. The former U.S. Navy officer wrote down many of his
memories while living in Southlake, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a pride about being a little piece in helping make
that possible,'' Pam Muller said. ``We always got the sense that it
was very important to the whole world.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Muller inherited a love for the canal from his parents,
Jack and Margaret, who lived in the Canal Zone during the
construction period and started a family there. Jack Muller, a
carpenter, helped build U.S. Army barracks, two high schools and a
Canal Zone junior college.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, when the U.S. government debated whether to give
the canal to Panama, Walter Muller argued against the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very concerned about the Panama treaties,'' he wrote in
1978 to members of Congress. A loss of hemispheric peace, defense
of the canal and degradation of morale in the U.S. military were
among his chief worries.
</P>
<P>
   The treaties won approval. But the family's connection to the
canal remains.
</P>
<P>
   When Jack Muller left New York in 1912, the 22-year-old was
searching for work and adventure, family members said. His voyage
on the SS Advance marked the beginning of a love that beckoned him
to Panama, even in death.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandparents' ashes were spread in the canal. That's how
attached they were to the area,'' Pam Muller said.

   As a child in the 1920s, Walter Muller played baseball, followed
railroad tracks to his grade school and enjoyed watching U.S.

   But instead of growing up on apple pie or selling newspapers on
New York streets, the plucky youngster ate plantains and sold
parakeets and fish to sailors traveling through the steamy,
tropical Isthmus of Panama.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the life of children whose parents migrated to Central
America during construction of a historic interoceanic passage, the
Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
   The passageway, completed in 1914, didn't just connect the
Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea (and thus, the Atlantic Ocean).
It was a strategic military point that solidified the United
States' role as a world power, and an engineering achievement from
which many Americans and Panamanians drew pride. Canal workers
built history and helped to establish Panama's rich mosaic of
cultures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The canal is not just the ditch, the waterway. The canal is
all those who participated in its construction and in its present
day,'' said Angeles Ramos Baquero, director of the Interoceanic
Canal Museum of Panama.
</P>
<P>
   That legacy is alive in the family albums and the memoirs of
those who descended from Panama Canal workers. It ties the Mullers
to other families _ the Williamses, the McConaugheys, the Hayneses
_ who are living miles apart in North Texas cities such as
Southlake and Plano, or across the United States or in Panama.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-five years after the canal was built, the Panamanian
government is preparing to assume control of it from the United
States on Dec. 31. As that day draws closer, families reflect on
their ties to the canal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of sad,'' said Pam Muller, a Southlake resident who
kept her father's memoirs. ``It makes me miss my dad. I wish he
were here to talk about how he feels.''
</P>
<P>
   Many descendants try to keep up with events leading to the
transition through e-mail, reunions and news stories about the
canal as its latest chapter unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   The personal stories they tell aren't in history books but are
among the canal milestones that began with U.S. workers leaving
states such as California and New Jersey to find work in Panama.
</P>
<P>
   After a French attempt to build the canal was plagued by
mismanagement and yellow fever, Americans took up the ambitious and
dangerous project during the leadership of President Theodore
Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Laborers came from all over the world to help build the canal.
Workers from Jamaica, Barbados and the Virgin Islands labored
alongside Panamanians, Greeks, Europeans and Asians. U.S.
carpenters, boilermakers and railroad crane operators were among
those lured by the promise of good wages and opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   The canal was completed in 10 years for about $387 million,
according to the Panama Canal Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing. It was a miracle,'' said Cedric Williams, a
Plano resident who is a descendent of a Jamaican immigrant who
found work in Panama in the early 1900s. ``I think that's the
biggest construction of this century. They had to do it through
sickness and while speaking different languages.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles W. Hummer Jr., executive vice president of the Panama
Canal Society Foundation in Florida, said his grandfather and a
great-uncle went to Panama in 1904 after seeing an advertisement
stating, ``Jobs in Canal Zone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me it seemed like a challenging thing to do,'' Hummer
said of his grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   Louis, the great-uncle, died while digging the canal when
dynamite left behind during the French effort detonated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a fact of life that people got injured or died in this
business,'' Hummer said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said financial opportunity brought his grandparents to
the isthmus. The 57-year-old member of the Panamanian Association
of Dallas-Fort Worth said his grandfather found work as a cook for
the hospital where malaria, yellow fever and other diseases were
treated. He retired after working at Gorgas Hospital. MORE &QL;

100 GREATEST: THE 100 MOST MEMORABLE MOMENTS IN THE CENTURY OF
SPORTS NO. 91: SAYERS' 6-TD GAME WAS ONE FOR THE AGES (For use by
NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEPHEN SCHROATS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is safe to assume that Steve Sabol has seen more professional
football than anyone. As president of NFL Films, where he's worked
for 38 years, Sabol's job has been to review, edit and catalogue
the filmed history of the league.
</P>
<P>
   Would it be possible to single out, among those miles of film, a
singular person or play as the most memorable? For Sabol, the task
wasn't difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 25,000 cans of film going back to 1894,'' Sabol said.
``The most thrilling five minutes of footage you'll ever find is
Gale Sayers in the open field. Gale Sayers is the most exciting,
thrilling player in the history of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   With the third and fourth picks of the 1965 NFL draft, Bears
coach and owner George Halas chose Dick Butkus, a middle linebacker
from Illinois, and Sayers, a halfback from Kansas. At the time,
Halas was certain that Butkus would excel, but about Sayers openly
wondered if, ``some of his \Rcollegiate\S performance was just
luck.''
</P>
<P>
   That was answered in Sayers' first exhibition game with the
Bears. He returned a punt 77 yards for a touchdown, took a kickoff
93 yards for a score, and completed a 25-yard option pass for a
touchdown . That was the precursor to Sayers' record 22-touchdown
rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   Sayers' legend was validated Dec. 12, 1965, on a soggy, sloppy
Wrigley Field. His six-touchdown performance that day was one of
the most extraordinary feats in the 80 years of the NFL, as Chicago
defeated San Francisco, 61-20.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter, Sayers took a screen pass from Rudy Bukich
and churned 80 yards through the mud for a score. By the end of the
third quarter, Sayers had added touchdown runs of 21, 7, 50 and 1
yard. His crowning achievement came on a fourth-quarter punt
return.
</P>
<P>
   Fielding the ball at his 15, Sayers started right, shed a
tackler, and sped upfield. At midfield, he crossed to the left
sideline, unimpeded by mud or tacklers, and finished his misty
flight in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been proud that I had enough left in the fourth
quarter to run that one in,'' Sayers later said.
</P>
<P>
   His six touchdowns equaled the NFL record set in 1929 by Chicago
Cardinals halfback Ernie Nevers and matched in 1951 by Cleveland
Browns running back Dub Jones.
</P>
<P>
   When he left the game in the fourth quarter, Sayers had touched
the ball only 16 times, yet amassed 336 yards: 113 on nine rushes,
89 on two catches, and 134 on five punt returns _ this in just his
11th NFL start.
</P>
<P>
   Sabol relayed a memorable line from Papa Bear that put the
halfback's career in perspective: ``Halas said, `If one is certain
of anything in football, it is that we shall not look upon his like
again.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sayers suffered a devastating injury to his right knee in 1968.
He returned in 1969 to lead the NFL in rushing, gaining 1,032
yards, despite no run longer than 24 yards. All on a surgically
repaired knee and for a Bears team that won only one of 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   An injury to his left knee in 1970 spelled the end of Sayers'
brief but magical career. He retired in 1971 after playing only 67
games. In 1977 at 34, Sayers became the youngest player ever
inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   His legacy lives on in snippets of celluloid that recall flashes
of fluid motion, grace and speed that might never be equaled.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great athlete never reminds you of someone else. Others are
compared to them,'' Sabol said. ``Gale Sayers had the capacity to
create a moment of pure wonder. What he did on a football field was
unimaginable and undefinable.'' nn

TWO DECENT TEAMS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE MIDDLE AMERICA (For use by
NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oxford, Ohio, home of Miami Univeristy, is known as being the
``cradle of coaches.'' Today, it's the center of the mid-major
football universe. The buzz is loud, the traffic will be snarled _
and not just because it's Parents' Weekend and John Cougar
Mellencamp is in concert.
</P>
<P>
   The Mid-American Conference has a showcase game in No. 17
Marshall (4-0) and Miami (3-1). The Thundering Herd attack is keyed
by senior quarterback Chad Pennington. The RedHawks' upset hopes
are carried by senior running back Travis Prentice. Both are
long-shot Heisman Trophy candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real excitement and energy surrounding this game,''
said MAC commissioner Rick Chryst, a former assistant commissioner
in the Atlantic Coast and Southwest conferences. ``There are some
pretty high stakes on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there's a melancholy aspect. Both Marshall and
Miami are in the MAC's East Division. The winner can shoot for
playing in the conference championship game for a place in the
Motor City Bowl, the MAC's only guaranteed bowl. The loser can
probably forget about the postseason. Last season, Miami finished
10-1 _ it's only loss coming to Marshall _ and did not gain a bowl
invitation.
</P>
<P>
   In basketball terms, today's game is similar to a conference
tournament championship game where the winner gets a spot in the
NCAA Tournament and the loser can start washing and packing
uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really not concerned about the top-25 rankings,'' said
Pennington, the nation's sixth-rated passer. ``We understand about
the only way to get to a bowl game is to win our conference. That
is what we're focused on. By no means are we taking this game
lightly. We understand what it is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   For Marshall, what it's all about is continuing a season that
could become magical _ and futile. Marshall could become this
season's Tulane, an undefeated team that winds up playing in an
also-ran bowl instead of for the national title. The Thundering
Herd cracked the top 25 on Sept. 20. At No. 17, they're about a
month ahead of Tulane's pace; the Green Wave was tied for No. 15
the first week of November last season.
</P>
<P>
   The MAC, like the Western Athletic, Mountain West and Conference
USA, are not part of the Bowl Championship Series. To even be
considered for a BCS at-large bowl, Marshall would need to finish
ranked 12th or higher in the final BCS rankings. Because of the
BCS' strength of schedule and computer rankings factors, not even a
miracle could push Marshall high enough in the BCS rankings _ No. 1
or No. 2 _ to play for a national title.
</P>
<P>
   ``People still perceive our conference as being inferior, but we
know that's not the case,'' Prentice said. ``We can go out and play
football and beat anybody. I mean football is football. It doesn't
matter what conference you come from.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the innocence of youth.
</P>
<P>
   Pennington and Prentice are each having solid senior seasons to
cap off excellent careers. Pennington, at 6-foot-4, 220-pound, has
passed for 8,155 yards in his career and thrown 74 touchdown
passes. Prentice, a 6-1, 228-pounder, has rushed for 4,445 yards
and scored 67 touchdowns. He needs nine rushing touchdowns to break
the career touchdown record held by Texas' Ricky Williams.
</P>
<P>
   A record crowd is expected at 30,000-seat Yager Stadium. ``USA
Today'', ``Sports Illustrated'' and ``ESPN Magazine'' will have
reporters and photographers on hand. There will be
loud-blazer-wearing representatives from the Motor City, Mobile and
Micron PC bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, it makes it more exciting to get all this press,''
said Prentice, who two years ago rushed for 203 yards and four
touchdowns in the RedHawks' 45-21 upset of Marshall, which then had
wide receiver Randy Moss. ``Everybody has their eyes on you. You
know people are paying attention. So you have to go out and have
your best ballgame. So, I like it. It's good for me, it's good for
my team and it's good for the conference, especially nationally.
It's good for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get caught up in all the hype. Because when you get
down to it, it's still football. You can't worry about the hype.
You have to win this game, first. It's about football, first.''
SAFEGUARDING FOOTBALL'S TOP TROPHY
</P>
<P>
   Jared Newland has one of those dream jobs. He travels around the
country to the nation's top campuses and gets to watch each year's
best college football games, usually from the sidelines. Newland's
traveling companion on these trips is the 35-pound Sears Trophy
that is awarded to the No. 1 team as voted by the coaches' poll.
Think of him like the guys who escort the NHL's Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The Sears Trophy has been traveling around the country since
1993 and has been present for 45 games. Corporate Marketing
Associates, Newland's employer, targets nearly 10 games a year for
road trips. Thus far, Newland and the trophy have been at the
following games: Arizona-Penn State, Ohio State-Miami, Notre
Dame-Michigan, Georgia Tech-Florida State and Penn State-Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to pick out the games where there are
national-championship caliber teams,'' said Newland, who attended
Wyoming and worked in sports information there, at Tulsa, UT-San
Antonio and Utah State.
</P>
<P>
   For each trip, Newland ships the trophy _ which, with padded
carrying case, weighs in at 123 pounds _ via UPS. He shows up a few
days early in each town to display the trophy, squire it around to
television stations, etc. The football-shaped trophy is a frequent
set decoration on ESPN's ``GameDay''.
</P>
<P>
   There was some unexpected drama before the trophy's last road
trip. Newland shipped it from Tallahassee to Miami, but Hurricane
Floyd shut down UPS deliveries. When Newland arrived in Miami, he
couldn't locate the trophy in Miami at his hotel. He eventually
tracked it down after two hours of telephone conversations.
</P>
<P>
   The Sears Trophy, insured for more than $30,000, is a Waterford
crystal football that weighs 7] pounds and sits on a pedestal much
like a football tee. During games, it's displayed on the sidelines.
Newland keeps an eye on the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the players or the ball starts heading our way, I grab the
ball and head the other way,'' he said. ``Sometimes, the players
come over and look at it, touch it. Before the Arizona-Penn State
game, an Arizona lineman came over and touched it and then kissed
his fingers. Obviously, that didn't do his team much good.''
STOMPING SOME GRAPES
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Wisconsin had 54 penalties for 423 yards. This
season, the Badgers have 26 penalties for 241 yards during a 2-2
start. Wisconsin coach Barry Alvarez called Big Ten Conference
supervisor of officials David Parry this week to discuss his
concerns about officiating.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a reason why we've led the league in least amount of
penalties for four years,'' Alvarez said. ``Then, all of a sudden,
we get a \Rlot of\S little touchy-feely penalties. Why, I don't
know. There are some that are obvious. But there are some that are
very questionable, too.''
</P>
<P>
   If it sounds like sour grapes and tastes like sour grapes, it's
sour grapes.
IN QUOTES
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina quarterback Ronald Curry on the criticism being
leveled at coach Carl Torbush for the Tar Heels' 1-2 start:
</P>
<P>
   ``He's taking a lot of heat he shouldn't have to be taking. It's
not his fault. You can see who's out on the field making the plays.
It's not him; it's the players. We can talk all we want about
`we're going to do this; we can do that.' But a time comes when you
have to quit talking, put on your pants and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado senior cornerback Damen Wheeler on the Buffaloes'
second-half effort against Washington:
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second half they went straight at the belly of the
defense and were eating at us. I had to question our pride,
especially the second half. People were out there, but nobody was
making plays ... People stopped running to the ball _ just giving
up, I guess. No, I don't want to say giving up. But there's just no
excuse for how we played, no excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Purdue linebacker Mike Rose on today's game at No. 4 Michigan, a
team the Boilermakers haven't played in two years:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to finally say we can look forward to this Michigan
game ... To not play \RMichigan and Ohio State\S for two years,
everyone's kind of looked down on us and said, `Oh, yeah, you won
nine games, but you didn't play the big boys.' We're really looking
forward to showing everybody that we're for real.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA freshman quarterback Cory Paus on the sternum jacket he
doesn't want to wear to protect his bruised ribs:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a bulletproof vest. And it looks funny. If you don't
feel like you look good, you don't play good.''
BY THE NUMBERS
</P>
<P>
   1: Number of offensive touchdowns Southern Mississippi allowed
in consecutive losses to Big 12 teams Nebraska and Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   4: Number of Texas teams ranked 100th or lower in scoring (out
of 114 Division I-A teams). Those teams are Baylor (101), Rice
(109), North Texas (110) and SMU (111). No other state has more
than one team ranked 100 to 114 in scoring.
</P>
<P>
   5: Misses by California on field goals in six attempts. All five
misses have hit one of the uprights.
</P>
<P>
   7: Number of pass plays by 5-0 Penn State that have covered at
least 47 yards. Last season, the Nittany Lions had just four pass
plays of that distance or greater.
</P>
<P>
   32-4: Florida State's record in games played when it was ranked
No. 1. The top-ranked Seminoles play 0-3 Duke today in
Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   25: Oregon State's losing streak against Southern California,
its opponent today. The Beavers' last victory over the Trojans came
in 1967, a 3-0 decision against the Trojans and junior running back
O.J. Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   34: Number of defensive touchdowns scored by Virginia Tech in
141 games under coach Frank Beamer.
</P>
<P>
   4 hours, 40 minutes The game time for the Southern
California-Oregon game Saturday. The Ducks won in triple overtime.
</P>
<P>
   0-5: Tommy Tuberville's record in the Mississippi-Auburn series.
While at Ole Miss, Tuberville was 0-4 against Auburn. He chalked up
another loss last week when his Tigers lost to the Rebels in
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   88-0: The aggregate score of New Mexico opponents in the third
quarter of the Lobos' past eight games.
AROUND THE COUNTRY
</P>
<P>
   Memphis can make the argument that it's the nation's best 1-3
team. The Tigers' losses have been by a combined seven points. And
those three losses game to teams with a combined record of 10-2 _
Mississippi State (4-0), Tennessee (3-1) and Mississippi (3-1).
</P>
<P>
   East Carolina, displaced for a week because of flooding in North
Carolina, spent most of the $250,000 the school earned for its game
at South Carolina to cover its expenses for the unexpected extended
road trip. The school also had to pay North Carolina State about
$6,000 for damage caused by East Carolina fans to Carter-Finley
Stadium as they celebrated the Pirates' 27-23 upset of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   State College, Pa., home to Penn State, is acknowledged as one
of college football's toughest logistical road trips. Indiana's
trip last Saturday was one of the worst. After a 45-24 loss to the
Nittany Lions, the Hoosiers were stranded because their charter
plane had mechanical problems. There were no hotel vacancies, and
Indiana had checked out of its rooms. So, their hotel put up the
traveling party _ coaches, players, cheerleaders _ in two large
ballrooms.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina has the nation's longest losing streak at 14.
That's because Kent, Holtz's alma mater, won Saturday, ending its
16-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   As part of their lucrative contracts, coaches are often paid for
their time doing weekly television and radio shows. Sometimes, it
hardly seems worth the extra cash. On his call-in radio show this
week, LSU coach Gerry DiNardo heard from a disgruntled Tigers
``fan'' who asked if the coach needed help moving out of Baton
Rouge.
SHORT SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   Short: Kansas State president Jon Wefald responded (why?) to
comments written by Will Leitch (who?) on ``The Sporting News
Online'' (what?) by ripping (in a letter posted on Kansas State's
Web site) the University of Texas and the state of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Shot: Another example of why not all adults should have access
to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Short: Tennessee is investigating possible academic fraud in its
football program involving other people doing work for players.
</P>
<P>
   Shot: Considering the school's graduation rates for football
players _ 57 percent, 11 percent, 25 percent _ in the past three
NCAA reports, the academic substitutes weren't exactly Rhodes
Scholars.
</P>
<P>
   Short: Colorado coach Gary Barnett's catch phrase to turn around
the Buffaloes was Return to Dominance (RTD).
</P>
<P>
   Shot: With the Buffs a disappointing 2-2, it turns out that RTD
might stand for Return to Durango. Barnett's first college coaching
job was at Fort Lewis College in Durango, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Short: Temple coach Bobby Wallace says, ``Offensively, we're
struggling about as bad as you can struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Shot: Wallace could be the coach at South Carolina. The
Gamecocks are last in the nation, averaging three points per game.
Wallace's Owls are next to last, averaging 3.8 per game.
</P>
<P>
   Short: Duke agreed to move today's ``home'' game with Florida
State to Jacksonville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Shot: To be fair, Florida State should agree to move this
season's ACC basketball home game with Duke to Charlotte. nn

PURDUE'S DIFFICULT MONTH BEGINS AT MICHIGAN (For use by NYTimes
News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michigan's 4-0 start and climb to the No. 4 ranking has been
fueled by a defense that ranks 18th nationally, allowing 271 yards
per game. The folks in Ann Arbor believe this Wolverines defensive
unit ranks favorably with the 1997 group that helped Michigan win a
share of the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Today, though, Michigan's defense has to switch from analog to
digital. In their first four games, the Wolverines faced
run-oriented teams _ Notre Dame, Rice, Syracuse and Wisconsin. No.
11 Purdue visits Ann Arbor today with junior quarterback Drew Brees
and the nation's sixth-best passing offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll know a lot more about our secondary after this game,''
Michigan coach Lloyd Carr said. ``I asked the team last week to
describe the secondary, and guys talked about it being hard-hitting
and all of that. I asked them if they wanted me to tell them what I
thought. I said it was a suspect secondary because that's what the
paper up in Syracuse said. I just call them the `suspects.'''
</P>
<P>
   Carr would like his defense to get some help from his offense,
which is averaging just 118.7 yards per game on the ground, 80th
nationally. Purdue enters the game with the nation's longest
winning streak, 10 games. For the Boilermakers, today's game marks
the start of the toughest four-game stretch any team could face
this season. Next Saturday, Purdue plays at Ohio State, then has
home games with Michigan State and Penn State. All are ranked
teams.

<P>
   MILAN _ Versace: By the end of Italy's Fashion Week, we had seen
bold colorations, intense beading, slit skirts, scarved necklines
and floral fabrications. At the standing-room-only Versace show,
which closed out the week of spring/summer 2000 previews, we were
hoping to see something original.
</P>
<P>
   But original this wasn't. It was more like a retrospective of
all the grand trails Gianni Versace had begun to blaze earlier this
decade before he was killed. All that seemed missing was the model
Naomi Campbell strutting in Versace as only she can, and ardent
customer Elton John in his usual front-row seat.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one does color and embellishment and vivid patterns
and just plain sexy like the house of Versace. And Donatella
Versace, who took over the design reins after her brother's death,
proved that the house is still in order.
</P>
<P>
   The clothes were either skintight or slashed at the breast,
thigh and backside to show a sinful amount of skin. Models came
down a Plexiglas runway over a narrow pond of waterlilies wearing
an eye-popping array of outfits, in shades of aquamarine, fuchsia,
orange, yellow, shimmering indigo, brilliant black and iridescent
white. Versace showed two distinct floral prints: one decadent and
blossoming, the other innocent and budding.
</P>
<P>
   There were compact jackets beaded with the trademark Medusa
logo, and breeze-blown coats bearing sequined buddhas in the lotus
position. Suede, silk and jersey knit shirtdresses had silver snaps
up the front. Gowns wrapped in the front and scarf-tied around the
neck. Super-sheer blouses were jewel-encrusted at the neck, waist
and wrists.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't much to signal where the label might go in the next
millennium. And though this show didn't break new ground, it was
quite a spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Miuccia Prada created classic clothes with a spoiled rich kid
edge to them for her more youthful and (relatively) affordable Miu
Miu line shown Friday. Given Prada's considerable influence over
the fashion industry, these were looks that will likely be copied
by other, even lower-priced, labels in some way, shape or form.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared as if Prada had deconstructed the wardrobes of prep
schoolers and debutantes down to their essential elements, and then
reconstructed them in styles to suit the postgraduate jet set.
</P>
<P>
   Dresses and unitards were cut from the same jib as button-down
oxford shirts. Necklines and pants hems were banded in the same
manner as varsity lettermen's jackets. A great many of the
ensembles featured T-shirt-thin turtlenecks. The line looked
sporty, relaxed and somewhat dressy all at once.
</P>
<P>
   Prada takes great pains to distinguish herself from other
designers. So while the trend is to infuse spring/summer styles
with vivid colors, she kept hers muted (pale blue, tan, burgundy
and olive). She didn't use as much leather as others have either,
but she did send out sheer looks in the form of pleated mesh
skirts.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Marni: If any Milanese label has burgeoning cult status, it's
this one. And dozens of women turned out for the preview at a
remote loading dock dressed in Marni's hot-selling arts-and-crafts
silk skirts. But Marni followers shook their heads in dismay after
viewing this latest, idea-starved collection. The clothes were
feminine, colorful and pretty, but the concept of putting dots on
nearly everything _ polka dots, painted dots, plastic dots,
sequined dots _ didn't seem especially inspired. The clothes looked
demure and delicate; skirts rarely rose above the knee, the fabrics
were thin but not too sheer, and the ruffled trims looked as if
they were unraveling. The collection had skilled craftsmanship in
its favor, but its one-trick nature left something to be desired.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a striking departure from other presidential
candidates _ past and present _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
delivered a speech to the Christian Coalition on Friday that barely
mentioned abortion, school prayer, gay rights or other matters
vital to religious conservatives. Even so, he drew a rousing
ovation and an unusually warm outpouring from the coalition's
founder, Pat Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's reception was a testament to the potency of his
presidential quest and underscored a new pragmatism among religious
conservatives. Many said they were comfortable with the governor
and, most important, believe he can win.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his advisers said he enjoys such a commanding lead in
the polls that he can behave more like a general election candidate
_ and avoid saying things that could haunt him if he wins the
nomination. That also explains why for the first time on Thursday
he surprised Republican leaders in the House by assailing their
spending proposals.
</P>
<P>
   But while Bush seemed to win over many at the Christian
Coalition, his strategy was not as successful on Capitol Hill:
Several House Republicans said they were angry, even felt betrayed,
by his criticism and that they had alerted the governor's aides of
their proposals in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Christian Coalition has waned in power in the past
year or so, it remains the nation's most powerful group of
religious conservatives. And its convention here attracted most of
the Republican presidential contenders.
</P>
<P>
   And while other candidates spoke more directly and passionately
about conservative issues, Bush was clearly favored by Robertson,
the group's president, who offered high praise for him and
dismissed the prospects of other Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm completely comfortable with him _ he is sound on the
issues and running a simply marvelous campaign,'' Robertson said in
an interview Friday. ``He's acting very presidential already. I
wouldn't say, `Well, come to the Christian Coalition and pander to
them _ and go to the labor unions and pander to them.'''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bush felt no need to tailor his message to the group.
Unlike his rivals, Bush essentially delivered his standard stump
speech to the 3,500 delegates. His only nod to the group was an
appended passage in which he mentioned having signed a bill
requiring that parents be notified whenever their unmarried, minor
daughters seek abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laws like this both respect families and protect life, and
these are some of the highest and most compassionate goals of
government.'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush opposes abortion and holds conservative views on many
issues, other candidates have questioned his commitment,
criticizing him particularly over his comment that there would be
``no litmus test'' for judicial nominees for their stands on
abortion and other matters.
</P>
<P>
   In their own addresses, other candidates put forth far more
direct and vigorous appeals, emphasizing abortion, homosexual
rights and prayer in schools.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole asserted that silent school prayer should be
permitted, and that the Ten Commandments should be displayed in
public schools. ``My commitment is to lean on the Lord with my
whole heart,'' she said, ``reading his word daily and earnestly
seeking his will in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, who is basing his campaign on backing from religious
conservatives, touched heavily on abortion, school prayer and
homosexuality. Unlike Bush, he said, he would make a judge's
opposition to abortion rights a prerequisite for appointment to any
federal bench. He added forcefully, ``My judges are going to
understand that marriage is between a man and a woman _ not two
men.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, reminded the group that he has
fought abortion for years. ``For 23 years,'' he declared, ``we have
fought together for the right to life.'' He vowed to be ``a
conservative president with guts.''
</P>
<P>
   The event at a hotel here came at a crucial time for religious
conservatives. Since former Vice President Dan Quayle dropped out
of the race this week and with Pat Buchanan expected to bolt the
party to seek the Reform Party nomination, Steve Forbes, Alan
Keyes, Mrs. Dole and Bauer are making particularly aggressive plays
for religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about other candidates who made more forceful appeals to
the coalition, Robertson offered a pragmatic analysis that they had
little chance of winning.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He was most critical of Bauer, saying, ``He's not going to win.
You don't win with 1 or 2 percent. And most people are not terribly
keen on a lost cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Told of the remark, Bauer replied, ``The voters decide who wins
_ not the heads of private organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said he admired Mrs. Dole, but explained: ``Elizabeth
is a very charming lady. She subscribed to virtually all of the
ideological points of the Christian Coalition. But I don't think
she will take first. Maybe she's playing for a role as vice
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson was even more critical of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
the only Republican contender who turned down an invitation to
speak. He said McCain's support of campaign finance reform would
make him a terrible president. ``It would absolutely gut
organizations like the Christian Coalition,'' he said. ``He will
not talk to our lawyers. He will not listen to reason. He is just
bullheaded on this.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the biggest threat to Bush is Forbes, because he is
organizing in pivotal states and pouring his own fortune into the
race.
</P>
<P>
   And while he was critical of Buchanan in his own speech for
Buchanan's comments on World War II _ and for threatening to bolt
the party for the Reform Party nomination _ Robertson defended Bush
for not mentioning Buchanan Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would seem self-serving if Bush goes after Buchanan,''
Robertson said. ``Then it would focus attention on Buchanan. And
that isn't necessarily a smart thing to do.'' Robertson said
Buchanan had canceled a scheduled appearance at the conference on
Saturday.

 &HT;    BellSouth considers merge with Sprint
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth Corp. is pondering a blockbuster merger with
Sprint, a combination of equals that could be worth nearly $90
billion.
</P>
<P>
   To complete such a deal, potentially the largest in
telecommunications history, BellSouth would have to outbid _ or
out-bluff _ MCI WorldCom, the aggressive, Mississippi-based giant
already reportedly closing in on an agreement to purchase Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth is also considering a range of other options,
including acquisition of several attractive pieces of Sprint, which
is based in Westwood, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Announcement of a deal between Sprint and MCI WorldCom could
come as soon as Monday. No competing bid from BellSouth is likely
until later in the week _ if it comes at all. Certainly BellSouth,
which has stubbornly held back from the telcom merger frenzy, could
again turn back from the brink.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of BellSouth are worth about $88 billion, roughly equal
to Sprint's value. By comparison, SBC Communications' pending
purchase of Ameritech is valued at just over $70 billion and AT&AMP;T
has offered to pay about $60 billion for MediaOne.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Marc Bacurin of JC Bradford, an investment company, said
a Sprint marriage to BellSouth stands a better chance of regulatory
blessing than a Sprint deal with MCI WorldCom. He said BellSouth
has ample reason to stop playing hard-to-get.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth could find itself too small to be a ``supercarrier''
and too big to be a niche player _ while its only potential
partners are either too anemic to help or too muscular to be an
equal mate. ``They have been so nonaggressive, but maybe they see
this as their last opportunity,'' Bacurin said.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has grown smoothly and profitably for years, but the
company seems increasingly hemmed in by events in an industry
roiled by mega-mergers. BellSouth has, in three years, gone from
the largest of seven regional Bells to the second-smallest of four.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to say that the industry is passing them by, but
relative to the others, they are getting smaller and smaller,''
said analyst David Burks of Hilliard Lyons.
</P>
<P>
   Should BellSouth desire just a portion of Sprint, analysts say
the most attractive is Sprint's Internet network, which might be
worth about $4 billion. MCI WorldCom would almost surely have to
shed that unit, since regulators won't allow one company to control
too much of the Net's ``backbone.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth might also be persuaded to take Sprint's local phone
service business, much of which is in the Carolinas and Florida,
both within BellSouth's nine-state territory. Analyst Anthony
Ferrugia, of A.G. Edwards, put the value of that business at nearly
$18 billion.
</P>
<P>
   For MCI WorldCom, Sprint offers the national wireless network
that a complete telecom company needs, Burks said. ``There are four
growth components in telecom: data, Internet, wireless and
international. MCI WorldCom has a strong presence in three of the
four.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth offers three of the four, but has mostly a regional
presence.
</P>
<P>
   That is drawback enough, but in those nine Southeast states,
BellSouth faces ominous trends that undermine its core business of
providing dial-tones for local service.
</P>
<P>
   Internet phone service and competition are likely to drive down
rates, and BellSouth already looks to calling features like voice
mail as the source of profits.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, rates that other companies pay for connections to
BellSouth's network have been dropping.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has looked to wireless service and international
investments to provide much of future growth. But the company has
been stymied in efforts to add long-distance service to its
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other Bells created by the 1984 breakup of AT&AMP;T,
BellSouth was long forbidden to offer long-distance in its region.
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 lifted the ban, but required the
Bells to open their network to rivals _ something federal
regulators say no Bell has yet done.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth hopes for permission to offer long-distance for its
first state _ Georgia _ early next year at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   When long-distance carrier Qwest Communications _ in which
BellSouth owns a 10 percent stake _ bought US West, it agreed to
surrender long-distance on US West turf. BellSouth might arrange
something similar with Sprint. Analysts said if the company waits
for regulators, it will pass up a strategic necessity.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth Chief Executive F. Duane Ackerman last year began
publicly touting data transmission as the future of the company's
business. Both Sprint and Qwest have national networks for carrying
data. In April, Ackerman announced the $3.5 billion investment in
Qwest Communications, the Denver-based company completing a
16,000-mile network of high-speed lines.
</P>
<P>
   But BellSouth's satisfaction with owning 10 percent of Qwest
proved temporary. Company stock has stagnated, while Qwest made a
high-stakes agreement to buy US West, the smallest of the Bells, a
merger that dilutes BellSouth's influence.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, analysts say, Qwest's network may not be
extensive enough. Sprint has a 30,000-mile high-speed network with
far greater reach.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth's high-stakes decision ultimately depends on its
directors. And the board members depend on the recommendations
brought by Ackerman, who, in turn, relies on a core of executives
who have spent their working careers in the company and _ before
the breakup _ at AT&AMP;T. The elite group includes Jere Drummond, who
heads BellSouth Communications, Charles Coe, who runs the phone
units, Earle Mauldin, president of BellSouth Enterprises, and Chief
Financial Officer Ron Dykes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the wild card in the BellSouth inner circle is Gary
Forsee, who was recently named to replace the retiring Sidney Boren
as the executive responsible for strategy. Forsee has been
unavailable for interviews since arriving about six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   He is a veteran telecom executive with some intriguing
connections. His previous job was as chief executive of Global One
Communications, a $1.1 billion-a-year venture that provides data
communications in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   It is part-owned by Sprint. Before that, Forsee ran Sprint's
long-distance division.

 &HT;    Looking into Norfolk Southern's history
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Norfolk Southern Corp. is the product of hundreds of
rail company mergers dating to the mid-1800s. In 1982, Southern
Railway and Norfolk Western Railway merged to form the current
company.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Railway, which was formed by the mergers of about 150
rail lines, traces its origin to the South Carolina Canal &AMP; Rail
Road Co., which ran the nation's first regularly scheduled
passenger train on Christmas Day 1830 in Charleston, S.C. When it
was renamed the Southern Railway in 1894, it operated 4,400 miles
of rail line in the East and South.
</P>
<P>
   Norfolk and Western Railway Co. was formed by more than 200
mergers over the years and began operating under that name in 1881.
Mergers during the 1960s positioned N&AMP;W as one of the nation's
dominant rail lines, with links from the Atlantic Ocean to the
Mississippi River and Great Lakes.

 &HT;    Norfolk Southern to sell Atlanta property
 &HT;    By Sallye Salter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Norfolk Southern Corp., whose large land holdings have
at times been eyed for office towers and sports facilities, has put
all those properties up for sale just as demand soars for sites in
the vicinity of Centennial Olympic Park and the new Philips Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Norfolk, Va.-based railroad, which has 2,700 employees in
metro Atlanta, owns 37 acres containing 404,020 square feet in four
aging office buildings along Spring Street. About 1,500 employees
are based in the buildings that are for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The company said Friday it won't decide whether to relocate any
of its employees until it strikes a deal for the properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't figure that out unless and until we have a deal for
these,'' said Norfolk Southern spokesman Frank Brown. ``We've got
to see what offers we get.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Holmes, a broker with Insignia/ESG Inc., which is handling
the sale of the property, said there has been ``some strategic
marketing'' to prospects such as large Atlanta companies who might
need the existing office buildings and to developers converting
downtown commercial buildings to loft residences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not really started the process with the land,'' Holmes
said. The largest tract, 20 acres on Spring Street next to the new
Philips Arena and CNN Center, is zoned for very high density
development, Holmes said. It was once considered a tower site for
the railroad or another company.
</P>
<P>
   Another eight acres adjoins the Castelberry area, where lofts
have recently flourished, Holmes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the opening of the arena, that whole area is hot,'' said
Kris Cooper, a Cushman &AMP; Wakefield broker who has handled deals in
the area. ``Interim uses could be parking,'' Cooper said, ``There
is a dire need for parking, and I don't know that the raw land is
ready (for development) yet. It may be a few years away.''
</P>
<P>
   No prices have yet been set for the properties, Holmes said.
While ``the timing is fortuitous'' with demand for downtown
property so strong, Holmes said the railroad's decision was driven
more by the timing in the business cycle for review of its
properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always been in the habit of looking at our assets all
around the system to determine the highest and best use for them,''
Brown said. ``It's been known for a fairly good while those
buildings are not ideal for us anymore. They are getting some age
on them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have spent a lot of time looking for relocation sites here
and elsewhere _ there are significant opportunities intown and out
of town,'' Holmes said.

 &HT;    Weather Channel transmitting via Internet
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Weather Channel has begun transmitting TV
programming via the Internet to a Memphis, Tenn., cable system, an
industry first and a step toward what the company hopes will become
a significant new business.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based programmer is sending local weather
information. The recipient is a Time Warner system, which serves
231,000 subscribers in metropolitan Memphis. The system will air
local weather information, commercial-free, on a separate, new,
24-hour channel.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Weather Channel and Time Warner say Memphis is the
first site _ in both companies' opinion _ to receive localized
24-hour television programming via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   If this service, called Weatherscan Local, proves popular in
Memphis, the Weather Channel plans to offer it to cable operators
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delivery via the Internet opens the way for the Weather
Channel to extend a great number of options to cable companies for
tailoring weather services to each unique market,'' says Decker
Anstrom, the Weather Channel's president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Although scheduled officially to launch on Monday, Time Warner
began airing the new channel Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The Weather Channel is based in Atlanta but is owned by
privately-held Landmark Communications, a diversified media
conglomerate. It is one of the most successful cable TV channels.
Its namesake channel is in more than 70 million households
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the Weather Channel has become a mature
business, and the company is looking for new areas for growth.
Executives say they believe the Internet offers the best
opportunity. It has built up a huge Web presence, becoming the
leading provider of weather content on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Now the company is moving that Internet weather content to
television with Weatherscan. Developed digitally for the Internet,
Weatherscan content can be endlessly customized and quickly
updated. This is not true for traditional television shows,
produced in a studio and transmitted via satellite to cable
systems.
</P>
<P>
   In Memphis, for example, Weatherscan will offer complete local
forecasts every two minutes. Not so on the Weather Channel, which
also offers national and international forecasts, specials and TV

   The cable system receiving Weatherscan Local recently upgraded
its plant to digital, a format that makes it easy to transmit data,
voice and video between televisions and cable wires.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Williams, a spokesman for the Time Warner Memphis system,
says his city is a good test site for Weatherscan. ``There is an
intense interest in the weather here,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   For one, the city is the No. 1 air cargo airport in the country.
It's the headquarters of Federal Express, and UPS also maintains a

agriculture. ``Farmers are also interested in the weather,''
Williams says.

WTO CHIEF DEFENDS ORGANIZATION IN SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Michael Moore, the New Zealand politician who now
heads the World Trade Organization, had a taste of Seattle Friday _
from breakfast and dinner with dignitaries to encounters with
protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who elected you?'' shouted protesters as Moore showed up for a
breakfast meeting on the Seattle waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   Moore was selected by a consensus of the WTO's 134 member
governments, some of which are democratic and some not. ``I would
have liked to have been called `the New Zealand candidate,''' he
said. In the eyes of the Asian and European press, ``I was always,
`the American candidate.'''
</P>
<P>
   He disputed the opponents' image of the WTO as a shadow
government in Geneva overruling national laws. ``We are an
organization of sovereign governments,'' he said. The rules are
what they agree upon, and in the case of the United States, require
ratification by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In trade negotiations, Moore said, ``Any country has veto power.
The United States puts its hand up, and things stop. Japan puts its
hand up, and things stop. The little guys put their hands up, and
things stop.'''
</P>
<P>
   At the breakfast, Moore got into a dialog with Jim Puckett of
the Asia Pacific Environmental Exchange. Puckett said the wealthy
countries can use the WTO to force poor countries to accept
shipments of toxic waste, which they thought they had banned under
the Basel Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your legal advice is wrong,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Puckett insisted that he was correct, and was finally cut off
from speaking.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Rockwell, WTO's spokesman, said later there has never been
a toxic-waste case before the WTO, and that if there were, a
country wishing to protect itself would win it. ``The WTO
specifically says that products that are dangerous to humans,
plants and animals can be kept out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office Sept. 1, Moore has been making the proposal
that the rich countries agree at Seattle to let in the goods and
services of the poorest countries with zero tariffs. ``For the
United States, these amount to 0.7 percent of imports,'' he said,
arguing that the United States could easily afford such a gesture.
</P>
<P>
   Moore bristled at opponents' questions that suggested that world
trade was against the poor countries. ``How dare they speak for the
poor countries,'' he said. ``These countries want investment.
They're desperate for it. They're all leading missions to
Washington, D.C., to get it. This,'' (he motioned as if the
protesters were still there) ``is very '60s stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore is a former minister in New Zealand's Labor government of
1984-1990, which deregulated the economy. ``Everywhere I worked,''
he said, ``we ended up sacking 50 percent of the workers.'' As a
result, he said, it takes a day and a half to unload a ship in New
Zealand, as opposed to four and a half days.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's opponents blame him for championing ``the most radical
set of economic reforms inflicted'' on any rich country. They call
him ``Mad Mike;'' he recently called them, they say, ``grumpy,
geriatric communists'' and ``a mutant strain on the left.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan's Ambassador Koji Watanabe was also in Seattle yesterday,
urging a greater effort be taken to communicate with trade
opponents who plan to disrupt the WTO meetings in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who believe in world trade should be talking to those
people who have misgivings about trade itself or WTO,'' Watanabe
said after addressing a Japan-America Society luncheon at the
Sheraton Seattle Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There must be some areas of meeting of minds. Trade has been
the most important engine of growth of the world's economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some arguments opponents are asserting ``may have some
justifiable grounds, and those are questions that must be
discussed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture and labor are valid areas for discussion, ``but WTO
is a positive organization for addressing issues of health and
environment,'' said Watanabe, whose first foreign service
assignment was as Japan's vice consul in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labor costs differ among countries and expansion of trade
creates opportunities for countries to overcome handicaps.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Watanabe told the Japan-America Society audience that
Japan is emerging from economic problems that forced it into
recession.
</P>
<P>
   Weak banks have closed and others have merged, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese companies, once bloated by workers assured of lifetime
employment have been reducing their workforce and becoming more
efficient, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a renewed confidence in the economy,'' and it is
resulting in imports from the United States and other countries,
Watanabe said.

POLICE PRESENCE AGAIN THWARTS ANTI-MILOSEVIC PROTESTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The demonstrations against President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia appeared to flounder Friday night,
with opposition leaders unsure how to respond to Milosevic's
willingness to use the police and an arbitrary legal system to
defend himself.
</P>
<P>
   A scheduled ``driving'' protest in cars and buses to Dedinje,
the suburb where Milosevic lives, failed when the police
predictably sealed off entry roads with armored vehicles and water
cannon.
</P>
<P>
   And a rally in downtown Belgrade attracted only some 7,000
people, who finally marched 200 yards to the political headquarters
of the opposition to protect a young Democratic Party official,
Cedomir Jovanovic, from being arrested by policemen who had
surrounded the building for nearly 20 hours.
</P>
<P>
   As Jovanovic was finally allowed to leave the building and went
into hiding, state television announced Friday that Belgrade
prosecutors had asked the police to investigate the ``perpetrators
and ringleaders'' of the violence at Wednesday night's rally that
left five policemen injured. Opposition leaders said they feared
that all of them might face arrest, even though the police
initiated the violence on both Wednesday and Thursday evenings.
</P>
<P>
   Early Friday evening, opposition leaders argued among themselves
about the risks and responsibilities of taking a more
confrontational line toward the police, one of them said. They have
not attracted the hundreds of thousands of demonstrators they say
are needed to force Milosevic to resign, yet they are unwilling to
call for an uprising. They decry Milosevic's willingness to draw
blood, but they seem unwilling to ask their followers to shed it.
</P>
<P>
   At Friday's rally, the Democratic Party leader, Zoran Djindjic,
said that on Saturday demonstrators would march to a hospital
center to visit those wounded earlier in the week. But the center
is on the same street where police blocked a march to Dedinje
Wednesday night. If the police block them again, Djindjic
suggested, ``we will stop this for a few days and then meet each
other in front of the federal Parliament and stay there until they
go.''
</P>
<P>
   His comments suggested that the leadership is considering a halt
to the nightly marches, with their risk of confrontation, and
instead will try to bring in more protesters from other Serbian
towns. The idea would be to produce a rally large enough to try to
show Milosevic that most Serbs want him gone.
</P>
<P>
   But other leaders suggest that they should turn their efforts to
forcing early elections from Milosevic, much as Djindjic's rival,
Vuk Draskovic, leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement, has urged.
Draskovic has refused to join these rallies and called them ``a
waste of time,'' saying that Milosevic can only be brought down by
elections, not by force. ``Milosevic is not a man you can force to
resign by singing, by dancing and by walking,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jovanovic's troubles, and the connected shutdown of the Glas
Javnosti newspaper and printing press for two weeks by the
financial police, are a good example of how Milosevic uses the
legal system to harass and undermine political challenges, said
Biljana Kovacevic-Vuco of the Lawyer's Committee for Human Rights.
``This country is expert at making a political case into a legal
case,'' she said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The police said they were investigating irregularities at Glas
Javnosti. But the real issue is a contract by the press to publish
the daily bulletin, Promene, or Changes, issued for free by the
Alliance for Change, and allegedly published without a license.
</P>
<P>
   The signer of the contract, and hence the publisher of the
bulletin, is Jovanovic, a 28-year-old aide to Djindjic, whom police
sought to arrest. He took refuge late Thursday in the offices of
the Alliance for Change, while plainclothes policemen surrounded
the building.
</P>
<P>
   They negotiated with Alliance lawyers for Jovanovic's surrender,
but he refused police offers of protection, and police did not
storm the building. Friday night, demonstrators set him ``free,''
and the police did not intervene. But he is likely to have to go
into hiding or face arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The police have also been blocking protest marches outside the
city center, where protests are authorized, on the grounds that
demonstrators are interfering with public order and blocking
traffic.

ADDRESSING LABOR UNION GATHERING, GORE AND BRADLEY CRITICIZE EACH
OTHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The debates that Vice President Al Gore and former
Sen. Bill Bradley are promising began in a virtual way Friday as
each candidate pleaded with an important labor union for support
and directly criticized his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   In his strongest words to date, Gore cast Bradley's brief
flirtation with an independent presidential candidacy in 1996 as
disloyalty to the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been tempted to leave the Democratic Party,'' Gore
said, speaking by satellite from Washington to members of Local 250
of the Health Care Workers Union, who were meeting in Oakland,
Calif. ``I've never been tempted to turn my back on the Democratic
Party. I've never been tempted to run as an independent and divide
the progressive coalition, and I have always, always been for
working families and for organizing.''
</P>
<P>
   In an videotaped appearance before the union, which played for
members earlier Friday, Bradley portrayed Gore as a life-long
Washington insider with little real-life experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president has a life that is primarily based in
Washington, and I think that gives us a different idea of who the
American people are and what we can do,'' Bradley said. ``I think
it also flows into a different style of leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments marked the first time that the two have criticized
each other directly to the same audience and signaled a distinct
escalation of Gore's determination to fight for his party's
nomination. When the two made separate appearances last weekend
before the Democratic National Committee they did not aim their
fire at each other.
</P>
<P>
   The comments also showed just how hard both candidates are
courting the labor vote. Local 250, a part of the Service Employees
International Union, is the second-largest health-care local in the
country after Local 1199 in New York.
</P>
<P>
   It is a critical part of the AFL-CIO, which is scheduled to meet
Oct. 12 in Los Angeles and consider whether to endorse a candidate
for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Gore once expected that endorsement, but Bradley's fund-raising
prowess and strong showing in opinion polls has given him enough
clout to at least forestall an automatic AFL-CIO nod to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism of Bradley was just one sign Friday that Gore was
trying to make good on his pledge to revitalize his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He also replaced his top pollster, Mark Penn, with Harrison
Hickman, a move that the Gore camp described as a way to focus more
closely on polling in the early-voting states of Iowa and New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters have very particular views in those states,'' said a
campaign aide, describing Hickman as an expert in polling specific
issues and voters rather than broad national sentiment. ``You need
research that is very, very targeted,'' the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gore was more overt in his criticism of Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas, the Republican front-runner. For the first time
Friday, he mentioned Bush by name, indicating that he believes that
while he must beat back the Bradley challenge, he must also carry
the party standard against the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   At a hospital here, Gore touted his support for a patient's bill
of rights and criticized Bush for not supporting one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that Gov. Bush will break with the Republican majority
in the Congress and start supporting the patient's bill of
rights,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also said that Bush, who on Thursday said congressional
Republicans should not ``balance their budget on the backs of the
poor,'' could not simultaneously oppose the Republican spending
plan and still support their proposed tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   And the vice president said that if Bush really wanted to
``demonstrate compassion for working families,'' he would break
with the Republicans and support an increase in the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who was in Washington to address the Christian Coalition,
seemed surprised that Gore had mentioned him. ``Really?'' he asked
a reporter excitedly when informed of Gore's comments. ``What did
he say?''
</P>
<P>
   After a description of Gore's comments, Bush said, ``Well, I
think that Vice President Gore needs to debate Bill Bradley.''

<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Like some other chief executives, Robert J. Nugent
shares the limelight with the founder of his company. In this case,
however, the ``founder'' is a clown with an oversize Ping-Pong ball
for a head.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday both Nugent and the clown, named Jack, will ring the
closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange to celebrate the
changing of the company's name from Foodmaker Inc. to Jack in the
Box Inc., after the quick-service restaurant chain that is its only
business.
</P>
<P>
   That Nugent, 58, can clown around at all is startling. In 1993,
Foodmaker was plunged into crisis after four children died and
hundreds more were sickened from Jack in the Box hamburgers
contaminated with deadly bacteria. The company was sued by victims
and franchisees and suffered heavy losses as customers abandoned
its restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Nugent himself, Foodmaker's No. 2 executive at the time, was
criticized after he apparently tried to deflect the blame.
</P>
<P>
   But Nugent and Jack in the Box have recovered in a major way.
The company has had record earnings in the last two years and
expects another record in the fiscal year that ends Sunday. Sales
in stores open at least a year were up 9.8 percent in the last
quarter, far exceeding those of most other burger chains.
</P>
<P>
   And Jack in the Box, which operates in the West, is expanding
into the Southeast this month as part of Nugent's long-term plan to
create a nationwide chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are running better than anyone else in the sector right
now,'' said David Rose, an analyst at Jefferies &AMP; Co. in Los
Angeles. ``Bob is the force behind all the change.''
</P>
<P>
   Nugent, who bought a golden retriever during the crisis for
added comfort when he went home, said the incident had made the
company stronger. ``As a result of having gone through it, we as an
organization have a sense of self-confidence that is second to
none,'' he said in an interview at the headquarters in San Diego.
``We just believe that there's nothing we can't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Nugent, a 20-year company veteran who became president and chief
executive in 1996, has received help in the recovery effort from
Jack, the star of a popular advertising campaign that is not afraid
to tweak the competition.
</P>
<P>
   In one spot, for instance, a Spanish-speaking Chihuahua tells
Jack he wants Taco Bell. Jack stares down condescendingly and says:
``So? You're a dog.''
</P>
<P>
   The company parking lot has a space reserved for Jack. The
annual report last year was a comic book featuring Jack. And new
business cards portray Jack's yellow hat on a red background.
</P>
<P>
   Nugent is more of a buttoned-down executive than a comedian. The
key to success, he said, is listening to customers through
extensive market research and providing good food and service.
``It's not rocket science,'' he said. ``It's really kind of a basic
business we're in.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack in the Box, whose real founder in the 1950s was Robert O.
Peterson, has a more varied menu than many competitors and aims at
young adults, rather than children. Nugent is proud of a new
policy, now also being tried by some other chains, of making all
sandwiches to order.
</P>
<P>
   With 1,500 restaurants, all in the United States, Jack in the
Box is the nation's fifth-largest burger chain, but is tiny
compared with McDonald's, which has more than 12,000 outlets in the
United States alone. With more than 75 percent of his stores
company-owned rather than franchised, Nugent says he can exercise
closer control over food and service.
</P>
<P>
   Nugent, who is from Dayton, Ohio, received a business degree
from the University of Cincinnati and went into banking. One day
about 30 years ago, he let his office be used to close the sale of
a mansion in Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   The buyer, Dan Lasiter, then 26, a founder of the Ponderosa
steakhouse chain, awed Nugent by paying in cash. Nugent soon shed
his banker's suit for a cowboy outfit to join Ponderosa as a
management trainee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute I went into the steakhouse it was love at first
sight,'' he said, explaining that one can change the look, service
or food at a restaurant and get instant feedback from customers.
``You can't do that in a bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Nugent worked at Ponderosa for 10 years _ the first two without
a day off. He joined Jack in the Box in 1979 as a division vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   When the first death from tainted burgers was reported in the
Northwest in January 1993, Nugent angered victims by blaming the
company's meat supplier and Washington state regulators. But Jack
in the Box got credit for offering to pay the medical expenses of
victims and for hiring an expert, David M. Theno, to create a new
safety system that set the industry standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning I would say it was a good healthy case of
denial,'' said Roni Rudolph of San Diego, whose 6-year-old
daughter, Lauren, died. Although her hard feelings linger, Ms.
Rudolph said Jack in the Box ``became a model or a template for
cleaning up a bad situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Nugent eats at Jack in the Box about twice a week. He also loves
fine wines and is part of a group starting a new vineyard in Napa
Valley. He was president of San Diego's Museum of Contemporary Art
for two years. He and his wife, Anne, have two daughters, one of
whom has followed him into the restaurant business as an executive
at Starbucks. Nugent now has four dogs.
</P>
<P>
   His goal, besides expanding nationwide, is to get Jack in the
Box onto Fortune magazine's list of most-admired companies. In
this, he's not clowning around.

   IPO WATCH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For New Issues, A Contagion of Red Ink &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is a truism that Internet companies that go public are
unprofitable, but that often doesn't stop their stocks from
soaring.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a page from that playbook, more unprofitable non-Internet
companies are deciding to go public, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet standards for lack of profitability are beginning
to affect the rest of the new-issue market,'' said Linda Killian,
manager of IPO(plus) Aftermarket, a $16 million fund that invests
in new issues.
</P>
<P>
   The trend has accelerated in recent months. According to Thomson
Financial Securities Data, a research firm in Newark, the
percentage of non-Internet new issues, excluding closed-end funds
and real estate investment trusts, that were running losses at
their offering rose from 25 percent in the first quarter of 1997 to
34 percent in the first quarter of this year, and to 55 percent
last quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public investors are behaving like venture capitalists,''
said Ms. Killian, adding that some such offerings hold promise:
``In many ways, they have business plans that are better thought
out and achievable than the Net companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Cohen, research director of Wit Capital, praises the
willingness of investors to look beyond the price-to-earnings
multiple. ``The growth of the Internet industry may have
conditioned the public to look at net present value measures other
than P/E's,'' he said. &QL;

<P>
   A Lackluster Quarter &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There were a few bright spots for mutual fund investors last
quarter: Japan funds and gold funds surged 23 percent and 18.5
percent, respectively, according to preliminary data from Lipper
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, these are also two of the least popular fund
categories, with total assets between them of $8.2 billion. That's
the size of the 65th-largest mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   The third quarter also showed that investors can lose money
during the summer without a global economic crisis and a hedge-fund
bailout, which clobbered equity markets last year, or an impending
war. (Stocks slumped badly in the third quarter of 1990, after Iraq
invaded Kuwait.) Every other year this decade, investors prospered
in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the S&AMP;P 500 Index lost 6.3 percent and the Dow
industrials dropped 5.4 percent, while the NASDAQ managed a 2.3
percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   Among the largest stock funds, those run by Janus stood out
again _ this time just by breaking even. The largest, the $32
billion Janus Fund, lost 1.6 percent for the quarter, while the $26
billion Janus 20 gained 1.2 percent and the $21 billion Janus
Worldwide was up 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the 12 months ended on Thursday, Janus 20 and the Janus Fund
ranked No. 1 and No. 2 in performance among the 25 largest funds,
with returns of 54.6 percent and 51 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Value funds skidded, with Washington Mutual Investors falling
9.4 percent, Vanguard Windsor down 10.4 percent and Vanguard
Windsor II off 13.6 percent. Over all in the quarter, small beat
large, and growth beat value.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of gold funds, ``the big winner in the domestic sector
is technology,'' said A. Michael Lipper, the Lipper chairman. ``The
loser is financial services.'' The average technology fund rose 7
percent, while financial services funds fell 12.7 percent, on
average. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Having failed to find a buyer willing to pay the
price he wanted, Ronald Perelman said Friday that he was taking
Revlon Inc. off the market and would instead try to sell two units
of the ailing cosmetics giant to raise much-needed cash.
</P>
<P>
   The news was a defeat for the billionaire financier, who
publicly put the company up for sale in April.
</P>
<P>
   Revlon said it expected the sale of the two units, Latin
American brands and salon-style hair care products, to generate at
least $500 million and to be completed by March 31. Talks were
being held with prospective buyers, Revlon said, but it declined to
name them. Revlon's chief executive, George Fellows, said the
proceeds would mostly be used to help reduce $1.6 billion in debt.
The rest of Revlon _ whose brands include the Almay, Ultima II and
Revlon lines of blush, lipstick and eye shadow _ will stay in the
Perelman stable.
</P>
<P>
   Because of troubles abroad and a glut of inventory, Revlon also
announced that it expected to post a large loss in the third
quarter instead of the small profit that stock analysts had
projected. That will lead to a large operating loss for the year,
and earnings next year are also expected to suffer. Investors
pummeled Revlon's stock Friday, sending it down 34 percent, or
$6.25, to $12, its 52-week low. Perelman was said to want up to $40
a share from an outsider investor.
</P>
<P>
   Although many companies had expressed interest in buying Revlon
_ Coty Inc., a German perfume mass marketer, and Unilever NV, a
Dutch consumer products company, were said to be among the suitors
_ they apparently could not countenance that top-dollar price. And
Perelman is known to hold the line on price _ whether in a
corporate deal or a divorce settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts conjecture that Perelman's intransigence on
Revlon's price stems from not really wanting to part with the
glamorous crown jewel of his portfolio anyway. Revlon gives the
thrice-divorced Manhattan bachelor access to the A-list parties
attended by supermodels and other beautiful women.
</P>
<P>
   Others suggest that Perelman could not take the loss of face.
``This is the first time in Perelman's career where he is put in
the position of other people dictating to him,'' said Allan Mottus,
a consultant to the beauty industry and the publisher of the
Informationist, a trade publication. ``When you bring a property to
other people that is reported to have some problems, I think in the
bargaining process what happens is people try to knock the price
down.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A 1980s-style corporate raider, Perelman has earned a dubious
reputation for bailing out of ventures just before they collapse.
Public shareholders have taken big baths at Marvel Entertainment,
Coleman, Consolidated Cigar and Sunbeam, in which he is still a
large shareholder. For many years after Perelman bought Revlon, in
a leveraged buyout in 1985, the company appeared to be an
exception.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last year, deep fissures have emerged in what
appeared to be a smooth skin. Competitors like Procter &AMP; Gamble
with its Oil of Olay line and Johnson &AMP; Johnson with its Neutrogena
line have been chipping away at Revlon's market share. A backlog of
inventory at the drugstore chains combined with weakening in key
international markets like Russia and Latin America also hurt the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Revlon now projects a 1999 operating loss, before charges, of
$70 million to $80 million. It said the loss stemmed from an effort
to reduce its bloated inventory, something that would position it
for better performance in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging investor displeasure, Revlon said it would
postpone product introductions and spend more on advertising to win
back customers. ``I don't want to diminish the effect of what we
announced today,'' Fellows said, ``but if you look past the short
term, getting the albatross of the inventory behind us really sets
the stage for a very solid and powerful year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   William Steele, a managing director of Banc of America
Securities, voiced support for Revlon's decision to take the
inventory down in one big bite. ``They have been trying to work
down quarter by quarter, and it wasn't working, so they are saying,
`Let's get it done now.' Obviously it's a very dramatic
announcement, but I think from a long-term perspective we are going
to start to see the company generate working capital efficiencies
and stronger cash flow.''
</P>
<P>
   But other analysts who examine corporate debt were not so
sanguine about Revlon's future. Indeed, the company's low-rated
bonds fell by as much as 36 percent Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed sale of the two units would make a meaningful dent
in Revlon's debt, said Al Alaimo, an analyst with Banc of America
Securities. ``But it is very difficult to say whether the company's
actual credit statistics will improve.''
</P>
<P>
   In a report on Revlon's creditworthiness, Merrill Lynch worried
that with operating losses so high, Revlon might exhaust its
current credit line before raising cash from the proposed sales and
be forced to borrow from lenders at high rates. The company said
that the expected loss would put it in violation of certain
conditions of its credit agreement and that it was confident it
could negotiate the necessary changes with its bankers.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the company does get a better grip on its debt, which
management has insisted that investors are making far too much of,
Perelman must contend with a big payment in another year.
Zero-coupon bonds he issued in 1998 through Revlon Worldwide, the
cosmetics company's privately held parent, come due on March 15,
2001, and are secured by 20 million of his shares.
</P>
<P>
   When the bonds mature, holders will be owed $770 million. ``In
order for the collateral underlying security on the bonds to
provide enough value to pay for the bonds,'' Alaimo said, ``he
needs a stock price of around $36 a share,'' or triple its current
level.
</P>
<P>
   Absent a surge in the stock, Perelman can roll over the bonds,
but to do so he must begin to clean up Revlon to attract new
investors. Or he could raise cash, which would require selling more
assets than announced Friday.

 &HT;    Suspected Florida A&AMP;M bomber arrested
 &HT;    By Marcia Gelbart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ A former potato chip deliveryman who used an
old identification card to get inside Florida
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M University has been charged in two recent bombings at the
state's historically black school, according to the U.S. attorney's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Michael Lombardi, 41, an unemployed white man, was
arrested by authorities early Friday at his home in a new
Tallahassee subdivision, a few miles from the 12,000-student
campus.
</P>
<P>
   Married and the father of two children, 9 and 16, Lombardi was
charged on two counts of illegally manufacturing a homemade bomb.
He could face up to 20 years if convicted. Other possible charges
include using a destructive device and also a civil rights
violation, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Patterson. Lombardi
is being held in the Federal Detention Center in Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI had been investigating the bombings, on Aug. 31 and
Sept. 22, as hate crimes. Both occurred in unoccupied restrooms. No
one was injured.
</P>
<P>
   An Ohio native who used to live in Orlando, Lombardi was
arrested a day after police officials publicized in the news media
an audiotape containing racial slurs and a surveillance camera
photo of Lombardi taken at a local Lowe's home supply store.
</P>
<P>
   The release of both led to more than a dozen tips from the
public. ``There was a consistency in the message in those calls,''
said Florida Department of Law Enforcement Commissioner Tim Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Lombardi had threatened a third bombing this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing leg chains and the jeans and plaid red-and-black shirt
he wore when a SWAT team of three dozen officers descended on his
house after midnight Friday, Lombardi said nothing during his
90-minute arraignment in the afternoon. His lawyer, Timothy Jansen,
entered Lombardi's plea of not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   He nodded to some of U.S. Magistrate William Sherrill's
questions, and occasionally conferred with Jansen. Not once did he
look at his wife, Cathy, as she sat in the courtroom behind a pair
of dark glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Jansen called the government's case weak, pointing out that
prosecutors haven't charged Lombardi with planting any bombs,
merely possessing one.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't prove that he made the device, and they can't prove
that he was at FAMU,'' Jansen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strictly circumstantial.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the complaint, Lombardi admitted it was his voice
on the audiotape, which recorded his Sept. 22 call to a Tallahassee
television station moments after the blast.
</P>
<P>
   Lombardi also admitted that it was him in the Lowe's photo, the
complaint said. That photo, taken the day before the first
explosion, shows him buying a plastic pipe _ fragments of which
were found at the Aug. 31 bombing. Lombardi told an FBI agent he
intended to use the pipe ``in a home irrigation system.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherrill ordered Lombardi held without bail, saying the evidence
of his making the incriminating phone calls as well as the bits of
plastic found on drill bits and a hand saw at his home were more
than enough probable cause to believe he is the FAMU bomber.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe I would be able to assure the safety of the
community with electronic monitoring,'' Sherrill said. He did grant
Jansen's request that Lombardi be kept apart from other inmates
while awaiting trial, because of the racially charged nature of the
phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Until about a month ago, Lombardi worked for Toms Foods, a
potato chip manufacturer with a plant about an hour from
Tallahassee. An employee there who helped FBI agents identify
Lombardi said that Lombardi's route included FAMU and that he kept
his ID card when he stopped working. The employee also described
Lombardi as ``an individual who did not like blacks,'' the
complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   Before his delivery route, Lombardi worked at Culley's
Meadowwood Funeral Homes, near his house, said a woman who answered
the phone there. He has a 1980 degree from the Cincinnati College
of Mortuary Science, and is a licensed embalmer in Florida. That
license was suspended from 1991 to 1994 because he failed to
complete an AIDS education course.
</P>
<P>
   Lombardi served in the U.S. Marines for about three years in the
early 1980s, his lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors at his old apartment complex were surprised. ``You can
tell he was kind of different,'' said Vatrus Parmer, a Tallahassee
city police officer who lived near him. ``He gave my boyfriend
beers, my boyfriend gave him beers, and my boyfriend is black.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a lovely wife and children,'' said Ralph Antonucci, a
realtor who sold Lombardi his new $115,000 home in December. ``He
was always friendly and always worried about whether he was doing
the right thing, with buying the house. He was just a man who
worried.''
</P>
<P>
   News of the arrest spread slowly across the usually tranquil
campus Friday, which was the first day of the school's annual
parents' day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scary at times, but you can't run,'' said Taunya Bryant
of Martin County, who was visiting her son, Zachary, a freshman at
FAMU.
</P>
<P>
   ``You, FAMU students, are the real heroes in this crisis. It
took courage to stay on this campus,'' University President
Frederick Humphries told hundreds of students and parents as he
stood in front of the administration building.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the explosions, the Rev. Jesse Jackson had
visited Tallahassee Sunday and encouraged students in a special
prayer vigil to keep attending classes.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, Gov. Jeb Bush said, ``Despite these
horrible attacks, the mission of the university has continued on
during these difficult times.''
</P>
<P>
   Heightened security throughout the campus will remain in place
over the next few days. Additionally, several permanent
surveillance cameras will be installed by next week, Humphries
said.
</P>
<P>
   And though the campus police checkpoints that were established
last week will gradually disappear, a new school policy will
require students and faculty to carry photo identification, the
president said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how relieved I feel,'' Humphries said. But he
reminded students and faculty to keep their eyes open. ``Students,
keep your doors locked in the student dormitories, and remain
vigilant to make sure there are no strange packages.''

REFORM CHAIRMAN ASKS VENTURA TO QUIT PARTY AFTER REMARKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Reform Party's lame-duck chairman demanded Friday that
Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura resign from the party because of his
assertion in Playboy magazine that ``organized religion is a sham
and a crutch.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's official response, as spelled by his spokesman,
was a smiling, ``Pffff!''
</P>
<P>
   In the November issue of Playboy, Ventura declared that
organized religion ``tells people to go out and stick their noses
in other people's business.''
</P>
<P>
   The party chairman, Russell Verney, faxed a letter to Ventura,
the party's only major electoral success story, saying his comments
``about religion, sexual assault, overweight people, drugs,
prostitution, women's undergarments and many other subjects do not
represent the values, principles or ethics upon which this party
was built.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have brought shame to yourself and disgrace to the members
of the Reform Party,'' Verney wrote. ``For the good of the members,
you should resign now from the Reform Party of the United States of
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Verney said in a telephone interview that he would meet with
party leaders early next week to decide whether to try to force
Ventura to stop using the Reform Party as his party identification.
Verney said members had lodged thousands of fax, e-mail and
telephone complaints about the Playboy comments.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Verney's move is sure to antagonize the many party
members who regard Ventura as the party's best hope for becoming a
permanent force in national politics. Verney is a longtime aide to
Ross Perot, who is believed by many party leaders to be encouraging
Pat Buchanan to switch from the Republican Party to the Reform
Party, forcing Ventura to share the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   At the party's national convention in July, members elected a
new chairman, John Gargan, who had been endorsed by Ventura. Gargan
had hoped to assume the duties before the official transition on
Jan. 1, but Verney has refused. The party's presidential nominee
will qualify for $13 million in Federal funds, and many leaders say
the party's constant infighting leaves it open to a coup by a
well-organized outsider.
</P>
<P>
   Verney said that before sending his fax, he called Ventura's
office and was told he could expect a response in ``two to three
months.'' Ventura, according to aides, read the fax, then smiled,
shook his head and went home for the weekend.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Flush with Republican pride after a visit to the
Reagan Presidential Library in California, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
endorsed Gov. George W. Bush of Texas for president on Friday,
saying he could restore the ``sense of unified purpose'' that
Americans had during the Republican administrations of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani made the announcement at an early-morning news
conference at City Hall, where he spoke with Bush by telephone,
their conversation broadcast for reporters over a loudspeaker.
Officials said the endorsement was timed to drum up attention for a
visit by Bush to New York state, which will begin Monday night in
Buffalo and end Wednesday in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am here this morning, just having returned from the Reagan
Library on the red-eye, so I think this is a very appropriate time
to do this,'' Giuliani said in the Blue Room at City Hall, where he
was joined by a fellow Republican, Borough President Guy Molinari
of Staten Island. ``I believe that Governor Bush is the best
candidate, Republican, Democrat, Independent or anything else, to
be our next president.''
</P>
<P>
   The unusual step of making the endorsement in a telephone call
rather than at a more traditional joint appearance also seemed
intended to insure that all of the formalities were out of the way,
and that Giuliani had joined the crowded bandwagon of Republicans
already supporting Bush, before the Texas governor arrived on
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani confirmed that. ``We thought it was best,'' he said,
``to make it clear that I support him and endorse him and therefore
everybody can have that question out of the way when we do
fund-raising and campaigning and everything else that we are going
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's endorsement was not a surprise. The mayor, who is
expected to run for the U.S. Senate next year, had quietly
committed himself to supporting Bush some time ago, and advisers
said he had been waiting for instructions from Bush campaign
headquarters in Austin. Gov. George Pataki formally endorsed Bush
in May.
</P>
<P>
   At the opening of their brief telephone conversation Thursday,
Bush quickly made it clear that the endorsement was mutual. ``Hey,
senator,'' Bush declared with his gentle Texas twang. ``I mean
mayor _ how are you?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Giuliani talked about teaming up on the campaign trail
next year. ``We're a winning ticket in your great state,'' Bush
told Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there were hints of a rivalry, although not a political
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that you're a winner _ like the Yankees,'' Giuliani
told Bush, needling him that the mayor's beloved team may well face
the Texas Rangers in the playoffs this year. Bush, a former owner
of the Rangers, quickly shot back, ``Wait a minute, Mr. Mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   But the rivalry that has been of biggest concern to Republican
politicians regarding New York state is that between Giuliani and
Pataki, both of whom harbor ambitions for higher office.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Giuliani had only nice things to say about the governor.
Asked if Pataki would make a good vice presidential nominee, the
mayor said: ``Yes, I do. I think that it's premature and
presumptuous to support anybody for vice president at this stage,
but I think Governor Pataki has the kind of record of leadership,
the kind of philosophy, the kind of approach to government so he
would be an excellent choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani also professed to have no interest in serving as
attorney general in a Bush administration. ``That is not one of my
preferences,'' he said. ``I haven't talked to anyone about being
attorney general. The thing that I am focusing on and the question
that I am resolving is about running for the Senate, solely that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani said he would welcome a return to the political
philosophies of the days when he served at the Justice Department
during the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent a good deal of the day yesterday at the Reagan Library
and Museum and it focused me on just how much this country is in
need of the kind of leadership that we had during the Reagan-Bush
administration,'' he said, ``the kind of focus in our foreign
policy, the kind of support of our military that we had then, the
kind of sense of unified purpose that Americans had.''

HOUSE REPUBLICANS FEEL BETRAYED BY BUSH

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans expressed a mixture of confusion
and bitter betrayal Friday after Texas Gov. George W. Bush
criticized their proposal to finance the party's spending plans by
delaying federal tax breaks for working-class families.
</P>
<P>
   Opening the first serious public rift between Bush, the
front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, and the
party's leadership in in Congress, Republicans said that Bush's
aides were informed several weeks ago about the proposal and never
gave any indication that they found fault with it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's strongly worded opposition to it in a statement on
Thursday clearly surprised House Republican leaders, particularly
House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, a fellow Texan and the plan's
author, who said on Thursday that Bush did not understand how
Congress works.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert said at a news conference Friday
that he had not seen it coming. ``The proposal was floated to his
people as well as others, is my understanding, and there was no
response,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill., accused Bush of ``a fairly
significant political misstep.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're right on the brink of trying to conclude our session,
and we're trying to resolve some controversial issues, and he's
poking his nose in,'' LaHood said in an interview Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of resentment and anger that he's poking his
nose in at the 11th hour,'' LaHood added. ``He needs to get on the
phone and do a little explaining.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Friday that he stood by his statement of Thursday that
House Republicans were trying to ``balance their budget on the
backs of the poor.'' He was referring to a plan to delay payments
of the earned-income tax credit, a tax break for 20 million
working-class Americans, in order to help finance the party's
spending plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a statement of principle,'' Bush said Friday, in a
serene, confident manner that suggested he was not ruffled by the
reaction of some House Republicans. ``And I still believe today
what I said yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for Bush, later added that Bush, who
is one of many contenders for the Republican presidential
nomination, does not coordinate his plans or statements with
congressional Republicans. ``That's not our role,'' Ms. Tucker
said.
</P>
<P>
   The chain of events suggested that although Bush has enjoyed a
good relationship with House Republicans to this point, and
although he has received endorsements from about two-thirds of
them, he will not be marching in lock step with them toward the
2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Several political analysts said that Bush was trying to
establish some distance from House Republicans, who have often come
across as ideologues embroiled in unending partisan feuds. Bush, by
contrast, has campaigned on the dual assertions that he is not a
Washington insider and that he is an inclusive, peacemaking,
compassionate conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much to their chagrin, the House Republicans became the foil
for Bush's attempts to establish himself as a compassionate
conservative,'' said Marshall Wittmann, an analyst at the
conservative Heritage Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to President Clinton's famed habit of finding the
broad center of issues, Wittmann added, ``It was a triangulation
moment and a declaration of independence by Bush. The irony here is
that congressional Republicans have linked their fate in 2000 to
his success.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and several advisers said his intention was not to separate
himself from House Republicans. Bush noted that he did not issue an
announcement about his opposition to the Republican plan, but
rather responded to a specific question he was asked by a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   But one senior House Republican aide said that Bush's remark
seemed more calculated than that, and that it indicated that he had
already figured out his position and therefore could have flagged
House Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't tell me it was an off-the-cuff remark to say `balancing
the budget on the backs of the poor,''' said the aide, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``The wording's too good.''
</P>
<P>
   The aide said that several of Hastert's staff members had
traveled to Austin, Texas, several weeks ago to talk to Bush's
policy director, Josh Bolton, about several upcoming issues in
Congress, including the Republican plan to propose spreading out
payments of the earned-income tax credit, currently paid in one
lump sum.
</P>
<P>
   Bolton indicated no opposition to it, the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were double-crossed,'' the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tucker said that Bolton did not remember the plan ever being
mentioned during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, Bush's dissent merely reflected the sharp
disagreements among Republicans in Congress about the plan, which
now appears doomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't agree with each other all the time, so why should he
agree with us all the time?'' said Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., who is
Bush's point man in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Blunt said that any pique at Bush was not widespread among House
Republicans, who he said appreciated Bush's intention, stated
several months ago, not to campaign against Congress.
</P>
<P>
   LaHood said that he did not believe that Bush was deliberately
reversing that course with Thursday's statement, which LaHood
chalked up to ``political naivete.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``These kinds of things can't happen if he wants to
continue to work as a team with those of us who want to support
him.''
</P>
<P>
   John Feehery, a spokesman for Hastert, suggested that Bush has
an interest in making House Republicans look good.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be much better for Gov. Bush if he had a Republican
Congress to work with as president,'' Feehery said. ``We hope he
keeps that in mind.''

MCHALE AND THOMPSON LEAD LATEST HALL CLASS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Mass. _ In one corner of the hotel ballroom, a
smiling Kevin McHale doled out a healthy supply of one-liners,
including, ``I used to have pictures of Bill Walton on my wall as a
kid, he's so old.'' Across the room, an introspective John Thompson
said he would probably be remembered for ``things that have kept me
out of the Hall of Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   McHale, whose repertory of post moves helped bring the Boston
Celtics three championships in the 1980s, and Thompson, who for 27
years was a domineering sideline presence at Georgetown University,
took divergent paths to the Springfield Civic Center on Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Carefree or controversial, their contributions to the game
earned them enshrinement in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall
of Fame, along with Wayne Embry, Billie Moore and the late Fred
Zollner.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who resigned from coaching at Georgetown on Jan. 8
with a record of 596-239, won one national title and turned
Georgetown into a perennial power by relying almost exclusively on
black players.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond coaching eight first-round draft choices, 75 of 77
players who remained at Georgetown for four years under Thompson
received their degrees. His legacy also includes a hard-line stance
on the unfairness of standardized tests by the National Collegiate
Athletic Association, an issue the NCAA recently gave credence to,
and a disappointing bronze medal as the coach of the 1988 U.S.
Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   McHale, the gangly kid from Hibbing, Minn., who gave up hockey
when he sprouted to 6 feet 11 inches, played in the NBA for 13
seasons. He made the All-Star team seven times and played on what
is generally regarded as the best front line of all time with Larry
Bird and Robert Parish _ a threesome that won three NBA titles,
nine Atlantic Division championships and six Eastern Conference
titles.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson and Embry _ who were backups for Bill Russell during
their playing days _ and McHale became the 26th, 27th and 28th
Celtics to be enshrined. They all dusted off Red Auerbach stories,
including Thompson, who made the mistake of not putting a contract
in writing with his new team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember telling Warren Brown I didn't care how much he paid
me, I just wanted to make the team first,'' Thompson said to the
former Celtics owner after he was drafted. ``I said: `Mr. Brown, if
you cut me, no matter what I tell you, I'm not going to get a dime
out of it. Let me make the team, and I'll come back and tell you
what I think I should have.' Well, when I came back, Mr. Brown had
passed away and I was in a smoke-filled room with a man eating
Chinese food, looking at me. I said, `Oh, no.' Red was sitting in
the room, waiting for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Embry, the five-time All-Star and NBA executive, was honored
Friday night as a contributor; Moore was a women's coaching pioneer
who won national championships at Cal-State Fullerton and UCLA, and
Zollner was the Pistons' patriarch and longest-tenured owner of an
original NBA team.
</P>
<P>
   Embry seemed the most affected by the induction, calling the
occasion ``the happiest day of my life.'' The 62-year-old president
of the Cleveland Cavaliers, who last season handed over the general
manager duties to Jim Paxson, was the first African-American to
hold a general manager post in any sport when he was hired by the
Milwaukee Bucks in 1972, a year after his 11-year playing career
ended.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond winning two national titles, Moore coached the first U.S.
Olympic women's team to a silver medal in Montreal in 1976. The
eighth coach in women's basketball history to reach 400 victories,
her players included the Hall of Famers Ann Meyers and Denise
Curry.
</P>
<P>
   Zollner died in 1982 at the age of 81, but his contributions
were remembered Friday night by Carl Bennett, the general manager
and coach of the Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons.
</P>
<P>
   Zollner helped the NBA weather financial crises its first few
seasons, contributing money, transportation and personnel to insure
the fledgling league's survival.

TEXAS GROUP CANCELS BUCHANAN APPEARANCES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAX B. BAKER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A Texas oil industry group canceled two
speeches by GOP presidential hopeful Pat Buchanan because of low
interest, officials of the group said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, whose high-profile interest in the Reform Party has
irritated some Republicans, was invited to speak to the North Texas
Oil and Gas Association next week at gatherings in Dallas and
Wichita Falls. But no one registered for the Dallas event, and only
eight people signed up in Wichita Falls, said Alex Mills, the
association's executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Although many of the group's members concur with Buchanan's
protectionist views on oil and gas trade, his anticipated bolt from
the GOP to the Reform Party and his recent comments on Hitler were
not well-received, Mills said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he'd be a great draw. He is a national figure, and
he is thought-provoking,'' Mills said. ``He is making people think,
and we like to have thought-provoking figures.''
</P>
<P>
   Association members also were concerned that a Buchanan
third-party candidacy would siphon off votes from the Republican
Party, just as Ross Perot's independent candidacy did in 1992,
Mills said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a sour taste in our members' mouths about Ross
Perot's run as a third-party candidate that got Bill Clinton
elected,'' Mills said.
</P>
<P>
   A campaign spokeswoman would not comment on the canceled
speeches. She said Buchanan will attend a private reception in
Dallas on Tuesday night and on Wednesday will autograph his book _
``A Republic, Not an Empire'' _ at a Borders bookstore in north
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan has said his critics are unfairly attacking his book,
one he has described as a ``boring, scholarly work on foreign
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Buchanan says that Hitler's Third Reich was no
threat to the United States after 1940 and that Allied guarantees
to Poland brought war to the Continent and gave the Soviet Union's
communist government two extra years to prepare for Germany's
invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, who is the GOP front-runner, and Republican
presidential contenders such as Ariz. Sen. John McCain, Elizabeth
Dole and Steve Forbes have criticized Buchanan for the writings.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said Republicans should welcome Buchanan's anticipated
switch from the GOP to the Reform Party. Bush has said he hopes
Buchanan will remain a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said he hopes to make a decision this month after
talking to Reform Party founder Perot and to Minnesota Gov. Jesse
Ventura, the party's highest-ranking elected official.

FLEET TO DOMINATE BOARD OF MERGED BANKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Having absorbed its former rival, BankBoston Corp.,
Fleet Financial Group Inc. has established a new corporate board
that reflects its chief executive's strong hand in shaping the new
company, sources familiar with the matter said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet's new 22-seat board is composed of 12 members of Fleet's
old 22-seat board and 10 members of BankBoston's 17-seat board.
</P>
<P>
   Gone in the new order are several strategic allies of Charles K.
Gifford, head of the old BankBoston and now the number two
executive under Terrence Murray, Fleet's leader.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent Gifford allies not on the new Fleet board include
Wayne A. Budd, the president of Bell Atlantic-New England, and
William C. Van Faasen, president and chief executive of Blue
Cross-Blue Shield of Massachusetts, according to the sources. Both
men were widely regarded as strong supporters of Gifford, who is on
the new board.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of a board might seem esoteric to casual
observers, but the choices reflect a business's heart, soul, and
character _ especially when the company is at the center of New
England's clubby banking world. Corporate boards represent the
interests of shareholders and oversee management. Members sit on
committees that set strategic agendas and policies, and must
approve all mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   The new Fleet expects to announce its new board next week, and a
complete list of appointees was not available Friday. Fleet
spokesman James Mahoney declined to comment, while two BankBoston
officials did not return calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Banking analysts could not be reached for immediate comment. But
one seasoned East Coast business executive said the choices
reflected moves by Murray to strengthen his hold over the nation's
eighth-largest bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry is consolidating his power,'' said the source, who is
familiar with the matter. BankBoston, a 215-year-old institution
that was America's oldest bank, ceased to exist Friday as an
independent entity.
</P>
<P>
   One BankBoston board member who has a place on the the new Fleet
board is William F. Connell, chief executive of Connell Limited
Partnership in Boston. Connell, a friend of both Gifford and
Murray, is widely credited with having played a major role in
bringing the two companies together in March, when they announced
their $16 billion merger.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said two other prominent BankBoston board members _
Alfred M. Zeien, the retired chief executive of The Gillette Co.,
and Thomas B. Wheeler, the chairman of Massachusetts Mutual Life
Insurance Co. _ would not sit on the new Fleet board. But
BankBoston board member Gary L. Countryman, chairman of Liberty
Mutual Insurance Co., will.
</P>
<P>
   Old Fleet board members not on the new board include Samuel O.
Thier president and chief executive of Partners HealthCare System
Inc.; Kim Clark, dean of Harvard Business School; and John R.
Riedman, chairman of Riedman Corp., a Rochester-based insurance
brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   Old Fleet board members who will stay include two longtime
Murray allies _ Paul J. Choquette Jr., chief executive of Gilbane
Building Co., a Providence-based construction firm, and James F.
Hardymon, retired chairman and chief executive of Textron Inc., a
corporate conglomerate also based in Providence, where Fleet was
headquartered before moving to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Current Fleet members Marian L. Heard, head of the United Way of
Massachusetts, and Joel B. Alvord, who owns a venture-capital
buyout firm, are also on the new board. Alvord was head of Shawmut
National Corp., the Boston bank that Murray acquired in 1995 in a
deal that moved Fleet's headquarters to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   When he struck his merger deal with Gifford, Murray amended
Fleet's charter to require an 80 percent vote by the board, or 17.6
members, to remove Gifford from the new company. Gifford is
scheduled to take the reins of the new Fleet at the end of 2001,
when Murray will retire.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet filed a document Friday with the Securities &AMP; Exchange
Commission that referred to the new company as Fleet Boston Corp.
Murray is considering using that name for the holding company, but
has insisted on calling the bank proper Fleet Financial Group Inc.
A Fleet spokesman said the name is a temporary one until a final
decision is reached next week.

AUTO INDUSTRY'S SALES FOR '99 MODEL YEAR BROKE '86 RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Customers lured by hefty rebates bought more than 16
million new cars, sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickup
trucks in the 1999 model year, breaking the sales record set in
1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are good times,'' said Roy Roberts, group vice president
of sales, service and marketing for General Motors Corp., which had
its best model-year results in a decade. ``The combination of
affordable vehicles, high employment and buying momentum continues
to propel us to record levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Most automakers reported strong September sales Friday, closing
out the 1999 model year on a strong note.
</P>
<P>
   Sales reported for the model year, which traditionally runs
through the end of September, so far total about 16.3 million
vehicles, already surpassing the 1986 sales record of 15.8 million,
said James Bush, publisher of Ward's Automotive Reports. That tally
doesn't include September sales for Ford Motor Co., the
second-largest automaker, which is scheduled to announce its
results Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is strong, and increasingly the auto companies are
buying the sales with aggressive incentive programs, and they can
afford to do that because of their continued success in containing
costs,'' Bush said. The incentives, offered by many automakers,
come in the form of rebates, discounted financing and cheap monthly
payments on leases.
</P>
<P>
   GM said its sales for the 1999 model year totaled 5,006,076 cars
and trucks, a 9 percent increase over 1998. However, the company
Friday turned in mixed results for September. Its overall sales for
the month rose 8.9 percent compared to the same period a year ago,
with its sales of sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickup
trucks jumping 30.2 percent because of strong sales of full-sized
pickups and sport utility vehicles. But its car sales dropped 6.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler Corp. said sales for its Dodge, Chrysler,
Plymouth and Jeep brands hit a record 2,651,090 for the 1999 model
year, up 8 percent from 1998. For the month of September, sales for
those brands rose 7.3 percent. Car sales rose 4.9 percent and truck
sales rose 8.4 percent. Small cars, small pickups and minivans
turned in weak showings, but larger sedans and sport utility
vehicles sold briskly.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Mercedes-Benz unit saw its sales rise 9.6 percent,
largely because of the continued popularity of its M-class sport
utility vehicle and its E320 sedans.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect Ford, which has been selling fewer discounted
cars to rental fleets this year than last year, to report Monday
that its sales fell between 2 percent and 4 percent in September.
George Pipas, Ford's manager of sales analysis, said that for the
industry as a whole, 1999 was ``easily the best model year in
history.'' The auto industry is also expected to sell more cars
this calendar year than in any previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota sold 1,465,399 cars and trucks in the 1999 model year, up
13.2 percent from the year before. The company said its September
sales rose 10.4 percent, with strong sales of its bread-and-butter
Camry sedan, its Tundra pickup truck and its Sienna minivan. Car
sales rose 4.2 percent, while truck sales rose 20.6 percent. ``Nine
months of sustained industry growth has surprised everyone,'' said
Jim Press, executive vice president of Toyota's American unit.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts earlier this week scrambled to revise their
estimates for industry sales upward. On Wednesday, John Casesa of
Merrill Lynch raised his estimate for the year's sales from 16.2
million to 16.6 million. David B. Healy of Burnham Securities
raised his estimate from 16.6 million to 16.8 million, well above
last year's 15.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Honda sold a record 1,067,468 cars and trucks in the 1999 model
year, up 7.4 percent from the year before. Honda's September sales
rose 9.7 percent from the same period a year ago. The increase was
due to strong sales of Honda's Odyssey minivan and its Accord and
Acura TL sedans. Honda's car sales rose 3.8 percent, while its
truck sales jumped 42.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan sold 653,771 cars and trucks in the 1999 model year, up
4.6 percent from the year before. The company said its September
sales rose 19.8 percent this year, with car sales up 12.7 percent
and truck sales up 29.3 percent. The increase came from strong
sales of its Xterra sport utility vehicle, Quest minivan and Maxima
and Altima sedans, and from sales of its Infiniti luxury division.
</P>
<P>
   Other automakers also reported strong September sales Friday.
Volkswagen sales rose 52.3 percent in September compared to the
same month in 1998, and the company said it had already sold more
cars this year than it did in all of 1998. Subaru said its sales
rose 17 percent for the month compared to the previous year, while
Isuzu's sales went up 55.7 percent, Mitsubishi's increased by 36
percent and Land Rover's rose 60.8 percent for the period.
</P>

BROOKLYN MUSEUM EXPANDS CHARGES AGAINST GIULIANI IN LAWSUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID BARSTOW

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Brooklyn Museum of Art on Friday refined its
lawsuit against Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, contending for the first
time that the mayor should be held personally liable for his
campaign to cut off public financing and evict the museum on the
basis of his displeasure with an exhibition of British art.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, ``Sensation,'' is to open to the public
Saturday, and several protests were planned by groups angered at
various pieces in the collection, which includes dead cows sliced
and suspended in formaldehyde and a portrait of the Virgin Mary
with a breast fashioned from elephant dung.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has called the portrait ``sick stuff,'' but the museum
asserted in a federal lawsuit this week that Giuliani had violated
the First Amendment when he withheld public funds from the museum
and then began eviction proceedings because the museum refused to
withdraw the disputed works.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the museum amended its complaint. In addition to the
First Amendment claims, the museum now contends that the mayor, by
singling out the museum for punishment, has violated the
Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law. In a
third allegation, the museum has accused Giuliani of violating the
state constitution and the City Charter by refusing to release
money already appropriated to the museum by the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas the museum's initial lawsuit was against Giuliani ``in
his official capacity,'' the amended lawsuit is directed against
Giuliani ``individually and in his official capacity.'' It also
seeks punitive damages, not simply lawyers' fees, in addition to a
judicial declaration forbidding the mayor from punishing the museum
in any way for staging the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   City officials did not return phone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the museum Friday
night to denounce the mayor. ``Lust for higher office and cultural
terrorism _ that offends my religion,'' read one protest placard.
Speaker after speaker warned of a chilling effect on all local arts
institutions should the mayor prevail. The demonstration, organized
by the New York Civil Liberties Union and People for the American
Way, seemed a sign of things to come Saturday, with counter
protests scheduled by animal-rights and religious groups.

   How would you like to be Peter Angelos, owner of the Baltimore
Orioles, and have the second highest payroll in major league
baseball ($86.4 million) but your team doesn't make the playoffs.
This has been a strange year in baseball. In recent years, the top
eight teams in payroll generally make the playoffs. Not so in '99.
</P>
<P>
   Player salaries:
</P>
<P>
   1.. NY Yankees $89.5 million
</P>
<P>
   2. Orioles $86.4m
</P>
<P>
   3. Dodgers $85.7m
</P>
<P>
   4. Mets $79.6m
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles and Dodgers are already out. And the Mets are on the
way out. Cincinnati is the only team in the majors with a payroll
under $50 million to make the postseason, if they hang on.

   Celtics coach Rick Pitino on second-year man Paul Pierce: ``He
is on his way to being one of the best players in the league. I
have never seen anyone work as hard as Paul has this offseason.
Every day he has been working out for five hours. Five hours. His
work ethic is fabulous. He wants to be a great player, and because
of the way he works at the game, he will be a great player.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino says the Lakers and San Antonio are the two best teams in
the league, but feels the Eastern Conference is ``wide open'' and
that his team will make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first year we overachieved. The second year we were a bad
team. This year we will be better and more competitive. People say
we pressed too much last season. In reality, we pressed about 10
percent of the time. We weren't in good enough shape as a team to
press more than that. And this year, we will press, maybe 30
percent of the time.''

   The thing that impressed the Giants' players and staff most
about Drew Bledsoe last Sunday night was the way he was unfazed in
the pocket even with defenders flying all around him. ``He never
moved once,'' said a top Giant executive. ``His feet stayed still,
and he got the ball out of his hand in a hurry. There's no one in
the league throwing the ball the way he is. No one.'' Says Chris
Palmer, head coach of the Browns who are next up on the Bledsoe
menu: ``The three games he has played this year are MVP season kind
of games. He is in total command of what he is doing.'' . . . Not
all things are rosy for the Red Sox. They have yet to be paid by
JCS, one of the two television networks broadcasting their games.
JCS got into the picture late, just before the start of the season,
and reportedly owes the Sox $10 million in rights fees. According
to some in the organization, the team has not been paid in full,
and wonders if the money is coming.

   It seems like Friday, I was sitting in the Celtic coaches'
locker room, listening to Bill Fitch relay a message from a mutual
friend. ``He said the big kid from Minnesota is the best player on
the team and if we have a chance to get him, he's the kid we should
go after.'' Fitch was telling Red Auerbach of a conversation he had
the night before with Indiana coach Bob Knight. Knight had coached
the United States in the Pan-Am games that summer, which had all of
the top US college players. At that point, Kevin McHale was not one
of the bigger names. Knight, who has a close friendship with
Auerbach, passed it on, and the Celtics followed up . . . Speaking
of Auerbach, who was 82 a couple of weeks back, he told a group at
the annual Red Auerbach Youth Foundation Golf Tourney this week,
``I've been down to see my statue (in Quincy Market Place) four or
five times. Every time I see it, I get scared. Only dead guys have
statues. But I got news for you. I'm not ready go yet.''

   Any sports fan with a brain knows by now the ESPN top 100
athletes of the century was picked by a bunch of clowns. How else
could you describe a group that picked Bill Russell at 18. Here's
Russell's unmatched career of championships: Thirteen NBA seasons,
11 championships. His final two collegiate seasons at San
Francisco, two national championships and a 56-game winning streak.
Also, one gold medal in the Olympics. So in 15 years of top-level
competition, he walked away with 14 championship medals. No one
else can match that.

   There has never been a bigger bunch of whiners and sore losers
as the European team that jetted home after the Ryder Cup with
tears on their blazers. Crybabies all. Did we hear griping about
the crowd or the conduct of the US team after Friday's play, when
Europe was ahead, 6-2? Nope. Did we hear any bellyaching after
Saturday when they went up, 10 to 6, and everyone conceded them the
Cup. Nope. Only when they lost were the fans unruly slugs, and the
US players a bunch of unsophisticated bums. The truth: it hurts
when you are supposed to have a walkover, and suddenly the putts
stop falling. Unsportsmanlike conduct had nothing to do with the
way the US team came back to win Sunday. The US team played better
when it counted most. I've spoken to more than 25 people this week
who were at Brookline Sunday and asked them the same question: Did
you hear anyone verbally insult the Europoean players? Every answer
was the same. No. In fact, many thought the crowd as overly
supportive of the European players. It is a shame that a vast
majority of what was reported in the aftermath was the beefing by
the losers, instead of praising the marvelous job the members of
The Country Club did putting this show on. There has never been
anything like it in sports in the history of this city. The members
are to be congratulated. Many of them gave up a good part of their
lives the last three or four years to pull it together. The
membership gave up their golf course for long periods to be primed
for the event. All of their work allowed the businesses in Boston
to gain more than $150 million in revenue. ``We have heard nothing
but the best of comments,'' says John Cornish, who chaired the
Ryder Cup committee. ``It couldn't have worked out any better for
us. And then we wound up with the greatest Ryder Cup in history on
top of it.'' I asked Cornish his most cherished memory: ``I have
not seen this reported anywhere, but I think it was the most moving
thing I experienced the entire week,'' he said. ``I was the marshal
with the first group, (Tom) Lehman and (Lee) Westwood. On the first
tee, Sunday morning, just as (Lehman) was to hit the first ball,
the fans around the tee started singing the national anthem. Tom
backed away, then went over and led the gorup in singing the
anthem. It was really moving, and it turned out to be a perfect way
to start the day.''
</P>
<P>

----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I pointed out that Pedro Martinez will be the first man to
average 13 strikeouts per game in major league history, and a
couple of fans wrote to point out that he'll have perhaps the best
strikeout-to-walk ratio ever, giving up just 37 walks and striking
out 312, one walk in every 8.43 strikeouts. Jim Pringle of Vineyard
Haven pointed out that pitching in the American League, Pedro had
to pitch against designated hitters, not pitchers . . . And last,
but not least, Rich Kreswick, who runs the FleetCenter, has just
been hired by the Bruins as their executive vice president. ``He
will still run the building like he has been doing,'' says Sinden.
``But now he will also work for the Bruins, running the business
side of the operation. He will head up marketing, ticketing, and
business side. He won't be involved in the hockey. I think it's a
great addition to our team.''

 &HT;    Forfeiture law funds police targeting drug dealers
 &HT;    By Scott Hiaasen
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In south Florida, when police
investigate a crime, they are thinking about more than just who
should be arrested and what the charges should be.
</P>
<P>
   They're also wondering if there's any property involved that the
police department can keep for itself.
</P>
<P>
   They do it all the time: grabbing a car used to drive to a drug
deal; snapping up tools used to strip a stolen car; taking money
used to buy and sell drugs; or keeping a computer used to download
child pornography. They can take any property used in a felony.
</P>
<P>
   Police see the forfeiture law as one of their most powerful
weapons against crime. But a Palm Beach Post examination of how the
law is used locally shows:
</P>
<P>
   _ Sometimes innocent people lose their property. For example, if
you lend your car to someone to buy groceries and they get caught
buying crack instead, the police can take your car and you may not
get it back.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nearly half the people whose property is seized _ and a third
of those who eventually lose it in court _ are not convicted of a
crime.
</P>
<P>
   _ Poor defendants are hurt by the law more than the big-time
drug dealers and criminals who can afford to hire lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Even some police and their lawyers admit that police make
decisions on seized property based on money, not justice.
</P>
<P>
   Seizing property has become standard police practice, one that's
also extraordinarily profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Police in Florida collected $124 million this way from April
1996 to March 1999 _ including $7.4 million seized in Palm Beach
County, the third-highest total for any county. Millions more was
collected by federal authorities and shared with local police.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office hauled in $4.3 million,
making it the most aggressive agency in the county. St. Lucie
County authorities seized just over $1 million in that time, and
police in Martin County collected $501,000.
</P>
<P>
   With this money, the police can bankroll long investigations,
buy high-tech equipment, meet state and federal grant goals, and
assist crime prevention programs. Last year, for example, the Palm
Beach County Sheriff's Office used $453,000 in seized assets to
buy, among other things, six video cameras for patrol cars, 10
bullet-proof vests, 25 bicycles, and 27 ``less lethal'' weapons
that fire beanbags and polyurethane bullets. The sheriff's office
also donated $328,000 to various youth groups and anti-drug
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Police are supposed to look at forfeitures not as a way to make
money, but as a way to prevent crime by stripping criminals of
their tainted wealth. But in practice, as the police and property
owners duel over the stakes, nearly every move and counter-move is
made with money in mind: The police want to collect as much money
as possible while spending little, and property owners try to get
back as much as they can without placing themselves at risk in
criminal court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like its own little ball park,'' said Catherine Kozol,
legal adviser to the Delray Beach Police Department. ``It's kind of
a game. I hate to say it that way, but it is. It's who can outsmart
who.''
</P>
<P>
   The peculiar nature of forfeiture law has spawned a court system
unto itself _ one that blends criminal issues with the rules of a
civil lawsuit. Defense lawyers say this system is harder on the
poor than on high-powered drug traffickers. For every major seizure
that can be linked to a large drug organization, police seize
dozens of cars from people in possession of small amounts of drugs,
or those accused of a comparably minor crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statute had some good intentions to punish the big-time
trafficker,'' said Stephen Melnick, a lawyer who once prosecuted
forfeiture cases for the Boca Raton Police Department. ``But the
only one getting punished is the small-time user.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They (police) use forfeiture law to raise money,'' said Jim
Eisenberg, a West Palm Beach defense lawyer who handles dozens of
seizures every year. ``It's the most regressive tax that's ever
been established. It's the poor that get hit the hardest.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a seizure has been made, the owner is thrust into a
complicated legal process separate from any criminal charges he may
face.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the police can seize property without even arresting
anyone. Forfeiture law is based on the premise that the property
itself is at fault, regardless of who owns it. The standard of
proof needed for the police to keep property is lower than the
standard necessary to make an arrest. Property owners must fight
the police at their own expense, and even those who are cleared of
criminal charges can lose their belongings.
</P>
<P>
   A Palm Beach Post analysis of 678 seizures in Palm Beach County
from 1996 to 1998 shows that property owners who have their
belongings taken by the police are found guilty in about 50 percent
of the cases.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm Beach Post analysis shows that this system can put the
poor at a disadvantage. For example:
</P>
<P>
   _ Defendants represented by the public defender in criminal
court are more likely to lose their property entirely, because the
public defender is barred from handling forfeiture cases. Private
lawyers hired to fight the criminal charges typically negotiate a
settlement with the police in return for the property.
</P>
<P>
   _ Because they didn't have a lawyer, some defendants have lost
their property for as little as a $5 crack rock, even though
seizures over such a small amount of drugs could be considered an
excessive fine under the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   _ So-called ``innocent owners,'' those whose cars were used in a
crime without their knowledge, sometimes must pay an
``administrative fee'' to get their cars back _ usually about $250.
</P>
<P>
   _ Often the police will choose not to use the forfeiture law
after taking small amounts of cash _ but in many cases they still
get to keep the money. The Delray Beach police have kept as little
as $32 belonging to a defendant, calling the cash abandoned
property after the criminal case has concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, police in Palm Beach County have seized all
sorts of items: guns, cameras, computers, boats, engines, cellular
phones, Jet Skis, jewelry, even an airplane (which crashed with 777
pounds of cocaine on board) and a golf cart (the getaway car in a
Boca Raton burglary). But cash and cars are the most common.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Lucie County, the Sheriff's Office files just two or
three forfeiture cases a month. But because it often costs more to
file the cases than it's worth, the Sheriff's Office usually just
levies fees _ usually between $250 and $750 _ that suspects have to
pay to get vehicles back.
</P>
<P>
   Most forfeitures stem from drug cases. Several times, state
troopers have found bundles of cash concealed in cars traveling on
the highway _ sometimes drug money is kept in a secret compartment,
or it's wrapped in sheets of fabric softener to throw off
drug-sniffing dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 678 cases reviewed, the police found $10,000 or more in
cash 62 times. Twenty-four of those came aboard Greyhounds or other
interstate buses, which are routinely searched by sheriff's
deputies looking for couriers moving drugs or cash for drug
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Over that same time, 432 cars and trucks were taken by police.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law is applied against whoever is caught with
contraband,'' said Jim Hicks, a lawyer who prosecutes forfeitures
for the Lake Worth police. ``It's disingenuous to say we are
punishing the little guy when the little guy has $100,000 in his
car that he can't explain.''
</P>
<P>
   LARGE DEPARTMENTS THE MOST AGGRESSIVE
</P>
<P>
   The most aggressive police departments are typically the largest
_ those with full-time attorneys. The sheriff's office and police
in West Palm Beach, Delray Beach and Boca Raton account for 86
percent of the assets seized in the county, according to state
records.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, police use the seizure law in tandem with an
arrest; it's the exception when officers simply take property
because they believe it's part of a crime. Of the 678 seizures
reviewed, an arrest was made 86 percent of the time; in 75 percent
of the cases, it was the owner who was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   But there were 94 cases where property was taken even though no
one was arrested. And in 72 other instances, the owner had to pay
the police or lose his or her belongings even though the criminal
charges were dropped.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened to Jorge Ignacio Alvarez, 27, of South Bay.
On the night of July 1, 1997, Alvarez was driving home with a
girlfriend in his 1993 Mustang when he was pulled over because his
license tag light was out. The deputy asked to search the car, and
found more than a half-pound of marijuana in a shopping bag under
the seat.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez and his girlfriend, Jennifer Baker, were charged with
felony marijuana possession. The charges against Alvarez were
dropped after Baker was placed in a pretrial intervention program.
But that didn't help Alvarez get his Mustang back. After paying a
lawyer to fight his criminal case, he had nothing left with which
to bargain with the sheriff's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just ran out of money,'' said Alvarez, who earns $11 an hour
at a sugar mill. ``I thought that once they dropped the charges I
would get the car back ... I had just finished paying for it when
it was taken.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez now drives a 14-year-old Oldsmobile his grandfather
bought for him for $800. His Mustang was later used by a sheriff's
deputy as an undercover car.

<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Walter Zenga went out a winner at home, at
least as a player. Zenga's final home start as goalkeeper produced
a 3-2 victory over Kansas City Sept. 7. But Zenga was playing with
an ankle injury, then was suspended after a confrontation with
referee Ted Covaciu, and did not perform again at Foxboro Stadium
before being fired Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga also played his last game for the Italian national team at
Foxboro Stadium, in a 2-0 victory over Ireland, June 4, 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the way I intended to say goodbye,'' Zenga said in
an open letter. ``Our goal was to bring the MLS championship to a
city that has had winning teams like the Celtics, Patriots, and Red
Sox. I wanted to give New England soccer fans a team they could be
proud of.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe I tried my best to do that in the short 10-month
period I was coach of the Revolution. Though it pains me to have to
watch my players and teammates from the stands, I will be at the
stadium to support my players against the MetroStars and into the
playoffs. Everybody who knows me knows that I will always be there
for my players and the American soccer fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some may say that I am too passionate, that I love the game of
soccer too much. To that I must say, yes, I am guilty. I am not a
bean counter that counts the number of people in the stands. I hope
I will never be. If there is even one fan in the stands I will play
for him. (Today) was supposed to be my last pro soccer game in a
20-year career. Management knew that. I didn't get a chance to play
in that game or salute the fans in the manner they know best.
That's a shame but it was not my decision. Unbeknownst to me,
management had already been offering my job to many other coaches
for more than three months. That's not the way to support your
team, your coach, or your players. That's not the way to win
championships. I know in my heart that I gave 110 percent to the
city of Boston and to the Revolution. For that I am proud and proud
of my players. (Former assistant coach) Beppe Galderisi and I thank
all of you for the support you have given me throughout this year
and know that you will always be in my heart.''

LEADING GUN MANUFACTURERS OPEN NEGOTIATIONS TO GET LAWSUITS
DROPPED 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif., Ill., Mich, La., N.J., N.Y. Conn., Va., Ga., Ohio,

<P>
   In their first major meeting with officials from cities that are
suing the firearms industry, the nation's leading gun
manufacturers, trying to get the suits dropped, have agreed to
begin negotiations to improve gun safety and reduce the flow of
weapons to criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Gun executives who attended the meeting said they would quickly
respond to a list of demands from the cities, including making new
safety devices mandatory and cracking down on corrupt gun
retailers. In return for an agreement, the municipal officials
said, they would withdraw their suits and their demands for
hundreds of millions of dollars in damages for dealing with the
cost of gun violence in their cities.
</P>
<P>
   The firearms industry has strongly resisted talks with its
opponents, insisting it could win any lawsuits in court, as it has
almost always done until now. So even the meeting of the two sides,
conducted in Washington on Monday, was seen as highly significant
by the participants, who were sworn to secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some manufacturers on our side who two or three
months ago would never have expected to go to such a meeting,'' one
gun industry executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure was growing on the gun makers, however, as the meeting
convened, as the first of several of the lawsuits filed by 28
cities and counties moved toward the discovery phase. That would
open the gun makers to the risk that lawyers for the cities might
uncover damaging corporate documents in an industry that has never
been held up to public scrutiny. Such documents proved critical in
producing settlements between the tobacco industry and states last
year.
</P>
<P>
   More pressure came later in the week, as a California appeals
court cleared the way for a trial in which a gun maker, Navegar
Inc., could be held liable for a murderer using its product. And
Colt's Manufacturing Co., one of the nation's oldest gun makers,
acted to reduce its role in producing handguns for the consumer
market in an effort to head off litigation against it. The
participants in the Washington meeting cautioned that the talks
were preliminary and that many obstacles remain to a settlement.
Some gun makers, most notably the so-called Ring of Fire companies
that encircle Los Angeles and produce cheap guns favored by
criminals, were not invited. Several key cities, including Chicago
and Detroit, which feel they have very strong legal cases against
the industry, did not attend.
</P>
<P>
   Also uninvited was John Coale, a Washington lawyer whose legal
team is representing five other cities, including New Orleans and
Newark.
</P>
<P>
   But one reason for optimism, some participants said, was that
Robert Delfay, president of the National Shooting Sports
Foundation, the major firearms industry trade organization, was
behind a carefully crafted framework that provided common ground
for both sides in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Delfay, who has close ties to the National Rifle Association,
stressed that the talks should focus on ways to reduce accidental
shootings and curb the flow of guns to criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The cities' lack of demand for money and the focus on reducing
accidental shootings and criminal misuse of guns led one industry
lawyer to remark, ``I don't think I've ever been at such a meeting
where both sides want the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The cities' demands were presented by Jim Hahn, the Los Angeles
city attorney, an easy-going person who was said to have made a
good impression on the gun industry officials.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most important and far-reaching of the demands was
that the gun companies establish tighter contractual control over
their chain of distribution, to curb the supply of handguns to
criminals and juveniles through corrupt dealers. If a dealer is
found to be supplying a sizable number of guns used in crimes,
based on gun traces conducted by the Federal Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms, he would be cut off by the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   The gun makers have denied they bear any responsibility for what
happens to a gun after it leaves their factory because they sell
only to wholesalers, or distributors, who in turn sell to dealers.
To enforce the agreement, it would be entered as a consent decree
by courts in the states where the cities suing the gun industry are
located. An independent monitor, picked by the cities and approved
by the gun makers, would be appointed with authority to oversee the
agreement. The gun companies would pay for the monitor and he could
only be removed for serious breach of his duties, lawyers involved
in the talks said.

 UNDATED: talks said. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The idea for the monitor came from Eliot Spitzer, New York
state's attorney general, who helped get the talks started by
threatening to file the first state suit against the gun makers but
then delayed it to give them a chance to negotiate. He attended the
Washington meeting, as did Richard Blumenthal, Connecticut's
attorney general, who has also threatened to sue.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent gun company executive in attendance was Ed
Shultz, the chief executive officer of Smith &AMP; Wesson, the largest
firearms manufacturer in the nation. Also present were officials
from Sturm, Ruger &AMP; Co., Colt's Manufacturing Co., O.F. Mossberg &AMP;
Sons, Taurus, Glock and Beretta.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal put forward by Hahn, the companies would also
have to take some other difficult steps, including agreeing to stop
selling handguns at gun shows or through the Internet. In addition,
they would have to stop advertisements claiming that handguns
increase safety in homes. And they would have to agree that
customers can buy only one handgun a month, a way to try to stop
illegal traffickers and straw purchasers who buy guns to resell
them to criminals or juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, industry executives have strongly opposed the one
gun a month idea, which is now law in Virginia and California,
arguing it interferes with their profits while doing little to stop
criminals. Instead, gun executives at the meeting asked the cities
to agree to lobby Congress for an increase in the budget of the ATF
so it can better monitor dealers and trace more guns, and to push
the Justice Department to get U.S. attorneys to more vigorously
prosecute gun traffickers, proposals the cities are happy to
support.
</P>
<P>
   To improve gun safety, Hahn said, the companies should include
external locks by next year and incorporate new technology still
under development by 2004 that would personalize a gun so that only
its owner could fire it.
</P>
<P>
   A city attorney who took part said that Hahn presented his
proposals as a wish list, but said that if the gun companies do not
agree to almost everything on the list, the cities would go ahead
with their lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regard this as a sweet deal,'' the lawyer said, because the
cities would be giving up potentially hundreds of millions of
dollars in claims.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Detroit and Chicago did not take part, a lawyer
familiar with their thinking said, ``because the tobacco companies
only made concessions when they realized they could lose and the
gun companies don't yet believe they will lose. Right now they are
just putting up a smokescreen.''
</P>
<P>
   Coale, whose group represents New Orleans, Atlanta, Cleveland,
Cincinnati and Newark, also said he felt the gun companies were not
yet ready to negotiate seriously. He held earlier talks with Robert
Ricker, of the American Shooting Sports Council, another trade
industry group, only to have the organization disbanded and Ricker
fired for daring to meet with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Spitzer and Blumenthal are being used, to make it look
like the gun industry is reasonable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Bruce Jennings, the owner of B.L. Jennings
Inc., a large gun wholesaler in Nevada who has close ties to the
group of handgun makers around Los Angeles, said none of the
California gun makers had been invited to attend, or even informed
about the talks by Delfay, breeding suspicion any agreement would
be reached at their expense.
</P>
<P>
   The exclusion of the California companies from the talks
underscores one of the major differences with the negotiations that
eventually produced a settlement between the states and the tobacco
industry _ there are only a handful of cigarette companies, and
while competitive, they had a largely unified negotiating stance.
But the gun industry is made up of many small, often barely
profitable companies who have different cultures and dislike each
other.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one of the California gun makers, Davis Industries, in
part to avoid the city suits, has filed for federal bankruptcy
protection, a tactic the others firms there may copy.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINE MOUNTAIN CLUB, Calif. _ Perched on a roof in this small
wilderness community, California condor W0 is a sight to behold.
Weighing in at about 20 pounds, with a wingspan around 9 feet and
history going back to the time of the mastodon, its presence is
awe-inspiring. But Mike Barth, a wildlife biologist, would rather
it just went away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have to flush him,'' said Barth, a supervisory
biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, after examining
the bird through binoculars.
</P>
<P>
   Before he got the chance, however, W0 obligingly lifted off and
sailed across the valley to its cohorts resting on dead trees. But
chances are it will be back.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the free-flying condors released in California
seem to have taken a shine to this retreat in the San Emigdio
Mountains about 50 miles northwest of Los Angeles. They have been
visiting regularly over the last month, confounding wildlife
officials, captivating residents and creating mischief by ripping
up deck furniture, doormats and, in one case, tearing through a
screen and into a bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   The condors are part of a group born in captivity after the
California condor's dwindling numbers and the threat of extinction
led officials to capture the last of the wild condors in 1987. At
that time, only 27 California condors remained.
</P>
<P>
   So successful was the breeding program that officials began
reintroducing the condors to the wild in 1992. There are now 162
California condors, with 113 in captivity, 29 flying free in
California and 20 more in Arizona near the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Although the condors have shown up in communities before, never
have there been so many that have been so persistent in their
presence in one area. One day last month, 15 condors showed up on a
Pine Mountain Club roof, and they have continued to visit.
</P>
<P>
   The new boldness has led to concerns and ultimately some debate
about how to address the situation.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Fish and Wildlife biologists move the birds along by waving
their arms or lobbing pine cones in their direction, and community
meetings have been held in many areas to encourage residents to do
the same. But some residents object to running the birds off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made my property off limits to fish and wildlife officials
because I don't like them harassing the birds,'' said Les Reid, a
former board member of the Sierra Club, who lives in Pine Mountain
Club. ``As far as I'm concerned they should leave the birds alone.
They're a great addition to our community.''
</P>
<P>
   This from a man who has had the most invasive visit to date.
Last month Reid, who is 83, was working at his computer when he
heard a racket upstairs in his bedroom. He went to check, and found
that eight condors had torn through a screen door and were wreaking
havoc.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't mad, I was just astonished,'' Reid said. ``I looked
at them. They looked at me. It was as if we were having a meeting.
I said, `You have to go the same way you came,' and they filed
out.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Reid and his wife, Sally Milhauser Reid, who has advanced
Alzheimer's disease and lives in a Bakersfield institution, had
opposed efforts to take the California condors out of the wild,
urging the authorities to focus more on securing their habitat.
Their fear at the time was that the birds bred in captivity would
become too tame.
</P>
<P>
   Reid points to the condors' behavior as proof that he and his
wife were right.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Mesta, the condor program coordinator for the Fish and
Wildlife Service, said it remained to be seen whether the
California condors bred in captivity would be different from those
that were captured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the population is heavily manipulated to maintain
it in the wild, there is a certain amount of evolution that has to
occur,'' Mesta said. ``These guys are going to have to learn to be
wild condors.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems being confronted now are not unlike those that
occurred when the birds were released, only to be killed or injured
when they came into contact with electrical lines. In response,
wildlife officials introduced a pre-release exercise in which the
birds received mild shocks when they sat on utility poles.
</P>
<P>
   Puppets have been used in raising the chicks to avoid human
contact, and now officials have also introduced a program to make
the first contact with humans unpleasant.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Mesta said, ``It wasn't as successful as the
power-pole aversion.''
</P>
<P>
   To some extent the birds' nature presents a problem. California
condors have existed in the wild with no predators and, as a
result, no real natural fears. In addition, the condors that fared
best in the wild were the best foragers; these were also the ones
with the most curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   Pine Mountain Club, a community of 1,900, is on a flight path
historically used by the condors, and many homes sit enticingly on
ridges where the condors can catch updrafts that allow them to
soar.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've never had any parents out here as role models, so
they've kind of learned everything on their own,'' Barth said. ``So
when they land on a house I try to make it feel wrong to them.''
</P>
<P>
   His concern is not so much that the birds will hurt humans, but
that they will hurt themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife officials hope that the birds' interest in humans will
disappear once they come of breeding age, which is 6 to 8 years
old. Eleven in the group of 20 staying in the southern part of the
California habitat are 5{ and could possibly begin mating next
spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping they have to think more about having another
mouth to feed and they won't have time to go curiosity-seeking as
much, if at all,'' Barth said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, wildlife officials and bird enthusiasts said
they would continue to try to strike a balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dilemma, it really is,'' said Clark Moore, a volunteer
condor monitor who conducts community education programs that
encourage residents to shoo the birds away. ``My philosophy is just
keep doing what we're doing until they get to be adults and have
some responsibility. I suppose it's not all that different than
raising a teen-ager.''

GARCIAPARRA'S WRIST BRUISED, NOT BROKEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Red Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra received the
expected good news Friday _ that his right wrist was bruised and
not broken _ but Boston manager Jimy Williams saw extra value in
his shortstop's trip back to Boston for the definitive opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It alleviates the concern that (Garciaparra) had,'' said
Williams after being notified of the medical results. Williams
added that Garciaparra had suggested that he return to Boston for
the examination, ``and it was a good suggestion by Nomar, to go
back to Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Team physician Arthur Pappas examined Garciaparra Friday at the
University of Massachusetts Medical Center in Worcester.
Garciaparra was hit by a pitch during last Saturday's game at
Fenway Park against Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bone looks fine,'' said Pappas. ``But there is a tendon
that travels under the bone that is bruised and that tendon is
swollen. Extra stress on the tendon can be painful such as a
checked swing, but it doesn't bother Nomar when he makes good
contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Pappas said he expects Garciaparra to take several days off but
should be fine for the American League playoffs, which begin
Wednesday. Garciaparra is expected to be back with the Red Sox
Sunday in Baltimore and will definitely sit out Saturday night's
game. Whether he plays in the season finale, said Williams, won't
be determined until he has a chance to talk with his shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he is not concerned even if Garciaparra, who leads
the AL in hitting, sits out this entire series in Baltimore. ``We
still have that workout day Tuesday (in Cleveland or Texas), which
will allow him to evaluate himself,'' said Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra left the team before Thursday's night game in
Chicago. On Wednesday, when the Red Sox clinched their wild-card
berth, Garciaprra led the team to victory with a key two-run home
run and sealed the victory with an unassisted double play to end
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't even close to 100 percent for that game,'' said
Williams, ``but, damn . . . that'd be a career game for me. That's
pretty impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   But the soreness in his wrist concerned Garciaparra and he
wanted to clear his mind of any worry, said Williams. Now,
``mentally he feels a lot better and physically, too.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Williams again would not disclose the Red Sox' third and fourth
starting pitchers in the division series, but left little doubt
that it would be Ramon Martinez and Kent Mercker. ``You guys are
smart guys,'' said Williams, ``you see what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Martinez will start Saturday for the Red Sox against
Baltimore and Williams would like to see him throw approximately
90-100 pitches. The third playoff game is scheduled for Oct. 9,
meaning Martinez will have a full week's rest. Mercker will be
Boston's starter Sunday. Pedro Martinez will pitch the opener of
the playoff series, with Bret Saberhagen pitching the second game.
</P>
<P>
   What has impressed Williams in Ramon Martinez's comeback from
reconstructive arm surgery is that his stamina has been strong. A
pitcher's legs weaken before his arm, said the manager, ``and I
thought his legs have been good. He looks strong to me out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams also will apparently wait until the final moments
Tuesday or Wednesday before setting his playoff roster. If the Red
Sox choose to go with 11 pitchers, as Williams seems to be leaning,
it may be that rookie third baseman Wilton Veras or DH-first
baseman Reggie Jefferson won't make the cut.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Williams intends to bring as many as 28 or 29
players to the playoff site and hopefully have them dress and be in
the dugout. The American League, and the opposing team, would have
to approve inactive players being in uniform, said Williams, but he
would prefer the inactive players be with the team as a gesture of
their contributions to the season.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Game 1 for the Sox (either in Cleveland or Texas) is scheduled
for Fox at 8:07 p.m., and Game 2 will be the following afternoon at
4:09 on ESPN . . . Williams gave third baseman John Valentin the
night off Friday, but said the veteran would be back in the lineup
Saturday as a final prep for the playoffs. ``I'm ready to go,''
said Valentin, whose achy left knee left him on the disabled list
three weeks ago. ``I'm pretty excited about being in the playoffs
and I hope everybody feels the same way I do.'' Valentin said he is
trying to recover his timing at the plate (``Sometimes it's there,
sometimes not; it depends on the pitcher'') but said he is both
physically and mentally ready for the playoffs . . . Pedro Martinez
was named the American League pitcher of the month for September,
the fourth time Martinez has won the award this season. It marked
the first time any major league pitcher has won the award four
times (out of six months) in one season. Martinez is expected to
pitch an inning Saturday after his brother Ramon exits. The two
brothers pitched in the same game six years ago when they were with
Los Angeles . . . Mike Port, the Red Sox' vice president for
baseball operations, is one of several candidates for the vacant
general manager's position with the Seattle Mariners. ``Mike's a
versatile baseball executive,'' said Red Sox GM Dan Duquette, ``and
has done a very nice job for the Red Sox.'' Port, the former
California Angels GM, has been with the Red Sox since 1993.

DEMOCRATS END THREAT TO BLOCK COURT NOMINEES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah, Calif., N.Y., Mo.)  (js) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An impasse over confirming federal judges ended
Friday as Senate Democrats gave up their efforts to block a vote on
a judicial candidate favored by Sen. Orrin Hatch, the Utah
Republican who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In order to press a point, Democrats had threatened a filibuster
against all the judicial nominees of President Clinton, a fellow
Democrat. The Senate Democrats had complained that the Republicans
were pushing through Ted Stewart, a Republican from Utah, who had
only been nominated in July, while other Clinton nominees had been
waiting years to be considered by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton nominated Stewart as a courtesy to Hatch and with the
hope that the gesture would speed up confirmation of several other
Democratic nominees to the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Under Friday's agreement, Stewart, along with two other
nominees, will be voted on by the full Senate on Tuesday. In
dropping their opposition, the Democrats ended the logjam, but may
have received little in return beyond a vague promise to consider
the candidates who have been held up the longest.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the Democrats will probably not get votes on
Marsha Berzon and Richard A. Paez, two nominees to the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, which covers California and several
western states.
</P>
<P>
   Paez has waited nearly four years for a floor vote and Ms.
Berzon almost two years. Democrats said that the Republicans are
trying to defeat Paez by denying him a vote because it would be
politically risky to vote against him on the floor in full public
view.
</P>
<P>
   Nan Aron, the executive director of the Alliance for Justice, a
liberal group that monitors judicial selections and supports the
Paez and Berzon nominations, said of Friday's agreement, ``We're
deeply disappointed that Senate leaders once again failed to
schedule votes on two superb nominees to the federal bench.''
</P>
<P>
   But in breaking the logjam, the Senate on Friday quickly
confirmed two people to the bench. They were Victor Marrero, a New
York lawyer, to be a federal trial judge in Manhattan, and M. James
Lorenz, to a district court seat in California.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over Stewart's nomination threatened to produce a
situation in which no judges would be confirmed until after the
next presidential election. There are 40 vacancies in the U.S.
district courts and 15 on the nation's appeals courts, the level
just below the Supreme Court, a vacancy rate of nearly 8 percent.

 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ From the vantage point of his college major,
business administration, and his current calling, homelessness,
Jesse Martin offered his considered summary of the latest federal
findings on the booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the statistics mean the Bill Gateses get the money
_ there's the boom,'' Martin said, more stoic than resentful as he
counted as riches his barracks-bed existence inside the Community
for Creative Non-Violence, a shelter housing 600 poor men, women
and children six blocks from the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the poor, they go like the song _ just getting poorer,''
Martin continued, citing all manner of real-life experience of his
60 years _ lately a heart attack without benefit of health
insurance _ to confirm the fresh data of the bureaucrats. ``Of
course the gap is widening. Whoever got the money, that's who
continues to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the capital city's underside, where social workers say
the most noticeable boom lately is the growing population of needy
homeless women with children, impoverished Americans easily
confirmed Friday the bleak footnote to the new Census Bureau report
on the rising incomes of America. For all the boom, income
inequality continues apace, the government concluded, with the gap
between the rich and the poor failing to narrow despite record
prosperity in the late '90s in the middle and upper social reaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of that surprises me,'' said Patricia Smith, a care-worn,
determinedly optimistic 49-year-old grandmother deep in poverty.
Ms. Smith, surviving on a patchwork of welfare and workfare,
charity and volunteer labor, recently learned that the four
grandchildren she found herself forced to nurture on the city's
streets all last winter will soon be joined by a fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``My two daughters are on drugs and one of them is pregnant
again,'' explained Ms. Smith, quietly alarmed at this growth
indicator in her role as the drug-free, court-appointed guardian of
the children of her addicted daughters.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of Ms. Smith, drug addicts receiving what she
considers overly generous government assistance stir far more
resentment than the rich Americans getting richer out there beyond
her horizon. ``The economy's plain,'' she said. ``If you don't have
money, you're not going to get anywhere. If you know somebody or if
you're not on drugs, you get pushed aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's rough out there,'' she said, describing a
harrowing three-month homeless period of bobbing and weaving with
the children in the streets and back alleys because, she said, she
could find no clear help from the city's anti-poverty bureaucracy.
``They said I had too many children for a shelter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This place saved me,'' Ms. Smith said gratefully at one of the
city's charity bastions, Bread for the City and Zacchaeus Free
Clinic. All about her, the monthly flow of 3,500 families seeking
charity food baskets was particularly heavy at midday. The first of
every month presses the poor to reach extra deep and seek out the
center's basket donations in waiting for their regular cash and
food-stamp dole to come around again.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``In the streets, I was washing the kids and changing their
clothes behind bushes, and many people were kind to us,'' Ms. Smith
said. She scowled at the memory of one man who she said talked of
charity in return for sex with the oldest granddaughter. ``I didn't
have a life, never mind an economy.''
</P>
<P>
   In a nearby corridor, 25-year-old Patrina Swinson waited for
some free-clinic care and scoffed at the boom and what she
considers its incessant consultation as an ultimate barometer of
life. ``My reality is not in stocks and bonds,'' she said. ``We're
all still scraping around here, still at the bottom. My reality is
in my neighborhood, not the economy,'' she insisted, proudly
describing her plans to learn computer technology to move beyond
her low-scale job as a counselor in group homes for troubled
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The economic boom's presence can be noted in the city's poorer
neighborhoods in the form of land speculation and the razing of
low-rent, if seedy, housing, in the view of Fred Henry, vice
president of the Community for Creative Non-Violence, a private
charity dating from the old anti-poverty programs and Vietnam War
protests of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Developers are closing out a lot of poor people with their new
emphasis on building middle-class housing,'' Henry said, citing
this as a factor in the fastest growing homeless category, women
with children. Aside from that, he said, ``Nothing has really
changed across the last five years of economic boom.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Larry Weeks, a 42-year-old resident of the center who was
disabled after a series of odd jobs, has been working in the
center's kitchen school, aiming for a fresh start. ``I listen to
all the news a lot and usually go by what I hear,'' said Weeks.
``But if you're out there living the economy, you know it's not
really booming,'' he said, describing his frustration in seeking
$10-an-hour jobs and finding only $6 or $8 ones. ``So what should
be reported from here is hard times, lots of hard times,''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A number of poor people interviewed emphasized that in the
depths of unrelenting material troubles, they bolstered themselves
on spiritual values. Steven Sanders, a 35-year-old computer
technician who said his life fell apart in addiction to crack
cocaine, insisted that he was on the right track back precisely
because he had adopted the Bible, not the economy, as his guide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, that's very
true,'' he said. ``But I feel you can only be `rich' in how you
treat others in God's image and how you feel within.'' He grinned
at what he said was this obvious point being missed in the endless
government data and analysis about the boom and the state of
national contentment. ``When the Bible says, `To whom much is given
much is required,' it's not really about the economy,'' Sanders
said from his place in the homeless shelter, looking happily out of
tune with the boom times.

 &HT;    By Rhonda Cook

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After 10 months in operation, two southeast Georgia
private prisons failed to meet the state's minimum standards in
inmate health care, staffing and security, according to a quarterly
audit.
</P>
<P>
   Critical security posts were not staffed for entire eight-hour
shifts, and inmates had easy access to medications and tools that
could be used as weapons, and more than one-third of the nursing
positions at one prison were vacant, the state Department of
Corrections audit said.
</P>
<P>
   Corrections Corp. of America showed ``borderline deliberate
indifference'' in running Wheeler Correctional Facility at Alamo
and the Coffee Correctional Facility in Nicholls, DOC regional
director Johnny Sikes, part of the review team, said in the audit
report.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the problems in the report were not as bad as
they were made to appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say the facilities are operated in a safe, secure,
humane matter,'' said Jimmy Turner Jr., CCA's director of
operations. ``The taxpayers are saving money by our management.''
</P>
<P>
   CCA receives $90,000 a day to incarcerate almost 2,000 inmates
in the two institutions, which opened in December.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the deficiencies have been raised in other
routine, quarterly audits. Some of the problems are only now being
fixed, DOC spokesman Mike Light said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a large prison corporation and these relatively minor
problems should have been fixed by now,'' said Light. ``These
issues are basic security issues (and) personnel issues.''
</P>
<P>
   There are almost 1,000 medium-security inmates in the Coffee
County prison. The state stopped sending inmates to Wheeler because
of the concerns; its population is 960.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of this comes to light because we have close oversight
over the private prisons,'' Light said. ``And we're not putting
(more) inmates in there until we get things right.''
</P>
<P>
   The report noted that both prisons did not have enough guards
and some ``priority'' security posts were not staffed as they
should be. ``No overtime was paid and there was no indication that
an effort was made to fill these positions or cover them in any
way,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Inmates had easy access to tools that could be used as weapons,
like scissors. Turner said there was only one such incident, yet
the report made a single mistake by one employee seem like
continuing, prisonwide problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have certain ways of doing things, within our policies and
procedures, that is different from the people, who are being
subjective, are used to,'' Turner said. ``We are attempting to make
it more clear to those individuals that we are meeting the
requirements by changing some titles. ''
</P>
<P>
   The report said there was no discipline and that ``inmates are
loud and unstructured throughout the facility. ... Inmates act
disrespectfully toward line staff, talking back, ignoring
directives, etc.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner disagreed. ``I just didn't see any disrespect,'' Turner
said. ``I saw more respect at the Coffee facility and the Wheeler
facility than I have at any prison.''
</P>
<P>
   DOC officials said they are most worried about the health care
CCA provides.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, health care services had deteriorated since the
time of the medical audit on July 22, 1999,'' the report said. ``At
that time, serious concerns were noted, which had not been
addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Light said many of the medical problems have been resolved since
the most recent report was written, but ``we still feel there are
some problems with the overall management of the medical area.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said inmates waited more than a week to see a nurse
because of staffing shortages. Dr. Christopher Fletcher, CCA
managing director of health services, said it was more like ``2.7
days from the time the inmate filled out the request.''
</P>
<P>
   The auditors also said narcotics were left on the pharmacy
counter; it took four days to refill medications; nurses sometimes
wrote prescriptions without a doctor's authorization; and the daily
distribution of medications was chaotic and took too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``The staffing pattern is not deficient,'' Fletcher said. ``We
have added staff beyond what is required. ... The scheduling is
improving gradually. (And) pill call could be shortened.''
</P>
<P>
   Light said the problems at the CCA prison began after the inmate
populations passed 750, moving toward 1,000 prisoners at each. DOC
plans to ask the Georgia Legislature next year for funding to fill
all 1,500 beds at each of the prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, DOC found some problems at a third private prison
in South Georgia, a prison Cornell Corrections Inc. built in
Folkston. Light said that facility now is operating properly.
</P>
<P>
   CCA has plans for 1,500-bed prisons in Jenkins, Wheeler and
Telfair counties. DOC says it has no agreement with CCA for those
facilities; the company has said it will try to lease the cells to
Georgia first before asking other states if they want to send
inmates.

ON BASEBALL: CANDID PIAZZA FAILS TO GRASP THE BIG PICTURE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mike Piazza has been as candid as any player while
the Mets have allowed their once-special season to disintegrate
into praying for a miraculous weekend. Piazza has never been the
type to berate teammates or make bold declarations, but he has been
honest and available, conspicuous traits in the midst of a
phenomenal collapse.
</P>
<P>
   When the Mets lost three straight games to the Braves last week,
Piazza admitted they had been walloped and looked nervous. When the
streak continued with three more depressing losses in Philadelphia,
Piazza's rambling answers and contorted facial expressions
indicated how bewildered he was about the Mets' spiral into
oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   So it was rather surprising that when Piazza offered his opinion
on the state of the Mets Thursday night, he expressed satisfaction
with a season that has disappeared faster than a slice of pizza at
a fraternity house. Piazza's voice was a curious mixture of
exasperation and pride, unwilling to let this season be remembered
as a total disaster. No, Piazza claimed, he would repeat this again
and again.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, with these guys here, if we're in the
same position next year, I'll take it,'' Piazza said. ``If we're in
the same position the year after that, I'll take it. I hope we're
always in a position to get to the postseason. I hope this doesn't
sound like we're folding the tent, because we're not. As I said,
our timing is tough. That's just the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza is wrong. Simply being in position to make the postseason
is not good enough for the Mets. It is not even close, not after
the way they crumbled last year and not after the way they have
collapsed even more dramatically this year. The Mets are a strong
team, a team that should have made the postseason after investing
$164 million during the off season. Just challenging for a spot is
unacceptable, no matter how many games the Mets wind up winning.
</P>
<P>
   This season is likely to be remembered as torturous, for the
Mets and the fans, especially the last 12 days. Piazza reiterated
his comments outside manager Bobby Valentine's office Friday and
explained that he would take 93 victories over the first 159 games
any time. It sounded like something a leader would say, but it is
hollow. The number of victories in a season is not relevant.
Playing games in October is.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're playing for the last weekend to get in, I'd take it
again,'' Piazza said. ``I know, sooner or later, it's inevitable,
these guys are going to come through. When we do, it's going to be
that much sweeter.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets probably have botched a journey to the postseason by
losing 8 of 9 games before facing the Pirates Friday night. Blame
Valentine, blame a lack of clutch hitting, blame an erratic bullpen
and blame Chipper Jones. When a team loses this often in pressure
situations, the blame spreads throughout the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   If Piazza were in Cincinnati, where the Reds have a $33 million
payroll and were not expected to reach the playoffs, his comments
would be correct. The Reds should be thrilled to simply challenge
for the postseason, and if they had ever stumbled out of the chase,
it would still have been a memorable season. Because the Mets have
a payroll of around $71 million, have not reached the postseason
since 1988 and occupy the same city as the defending World Series
champions, the scrutiny and the expectations are much different
here.
</P>
<P>
   When Piazza was reminded that another year without a postseason
berth was probably not going to be considered acceptable in New
York, he took umbrage with a realistic comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what?'' he said. ``Acceptable to who? I don't feel
that we have to validate ourselves. I think it's obviously an
unfortunate situation we put ourselves in, but by no means is this
a tragedy. Tragedies are little kids getting cancer. I think you
have to have perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Perspective is reality, and reality tells Piazza that the Mets
will make changes after two straight destructions. Valentine could
go, and though he is the same manager who guided the Mets to the
finest record in the major leagues for a three-month stretch, he
probably has to be fired. A fresh start would be necessary to
distance the Mets from the stench of the last two Septembers, but a
true No. 1 starter and a corner outfielder who can play defense and
go deep would be more vital than a new manager scribbling out a
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   As Piazza spoke about what has gone awry with the Mets, he
remembered to mention that they were not mathematically eliminated
before Friday night's games. Someone told Piazza that the Mets
could make those who have already buried them look silly by somehow
wriggling into the playoffs. Piazza smiled, considered the
possibility and expressed more honesty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the planets are lined up the right way,'' he said, ``I
guess that could happen.''

UCLA'S BROWN READY TO SERVE NOTICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ His injuries have healed and his suspension is
over, so make way for the local kid. UCLA senior tailback Keith
Brown will start today in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who attended Phoenix Mountain Pointe High, replaces
DeShaun Foster (sprained ankle) in the lineup, and his timing
couldn't be better. This is UCLA's only appearance in Sun Devil
Stadium in Brown's career. ASU visited the Rose Bowl in 1996, and
the teams did not play in 1997 or '98.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been thinking about this game since my freshman year,
when I looked (at the schedule) and saw we were playing ASU in
Arizona in my senior year,'' he said. ``This is a chance to show
people that Keith Brown still has it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a perfect opportunity for me. Maybe I'll get booed or
called a traitor, but I'll probably know half the people in the
stands, because Arizona's not that big.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown attended the UCLA-ASU game in 1995 (the Sun Devils won
37-33) and remembers fans throwing beer at the players. He
eventually chose UCLA over Arizona State, joining Jermaine Lewis
and Durell Price in coach Bob Toledo's first recruiting class.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get away from home and gain some independence,''
Brown said. ``The decision had nothing to do with ASU.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown battled injuries as a sophomore (knee) and junior (toe),
and he did not play in the first two games this year because of the
disabled-parking suspension. He doesn't plan to waste today's
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my breakout game,'' he said. ``I plan to shock the
world and show people who I am. They'll see my best. This is the
game I've dreamed about, so people in Arizona won't forget me.''
</P>
<P>
   Split loyalties: Arizona State coach Bruce Snyder's daughter,
Paige, is a UCLA sophomore and has been hired part-time in the
football office. Although the Bruins welcomed her, Paige postponed
her start until next week to avoid any conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about her access to sensitive information, Bruins coach
Bob Toledo scoffed.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't know our plays,'' he said. ``Heck, we don't even
know our plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Old friends: Toledo may have more in common with Snyder than any
head coach in the Pac-10. They play golf together and their wives
are friendly. In fact, Snyder helped get Toledo a job at USC in the
mid-1970s.

   ``He got me hired at USC,'' Toledo said. ``He called (ex-Trojans
coach) John Robinson and told him he should interview me. He was
leaving (to be the head coach at) Utah State, and I was at UC
Riverside and they were shutting down the program.''

degrees this afternoon, and it'll probably be hotter on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo urged his players to hydrate throughout the week, and at
their request agreed to use calf-length socks instead of standard
knee-length socks.

especially on the lines _ to prevent cramping and keep players
fresh for the fourth quarter.

 ILLINOIS HIGH COURT LETS PATIENTS SUE HMOs  
 (bl)  
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Illinois Supreme Court has ruled that patients can
sue health maintenance organizations for malpractice, declaring
that decisions on what treatments the companies will cover amount
to medical care.
</P>
<P>
   In the decision, Chief Justice Michael Bilandic wrote: ``Where
an HMO effectively controls a physician's exercise of medical
judgment and that judgment is exercised negligently, the HMO cannot
be allowed to claim that the physician is solely responsible for
the harm that results.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling is the latest in a string of decisions by state and
federal judges who have begun allowing patients to sue HMOs for
malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois decision, which was handed down Thursday, comes
after the legislature decided not to give patients the right to sue
HMOs in a law passed this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, California Gov. Gray Davis signed a bill that
will allow patients to seek punitive damages from HMOs for
negligence.
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois ruling came in the case of a Chicago woman, Inga
Petrovich, who complained of mouth pain in the fall of 1990 and was
told by her doctor to have an expensive diagnostic test. But her
HMO, Share Health Plan of Illinois, initially refused to approve
payment for the test, a magnetic resonance imaging examination.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year later the HMO relented and when the woman was
tested, doctors found that cancer had penetrated the base of her
tongue. Ms. Petrovich died last fall; her husband has continued the
suit.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, Bilandic, wrote that ``HMO accountability is
essential,'' because they are for-profit ventures. The court said
that HMOs act as a health-care provider and not just as insurers
since their rules on coverage affect the decisions of doctors.
</P>
<P>
   A trade group that represents HMOs expressed concerns that the
ruling could drive up insurance costs and ultimately leave more
people without coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very disappointed with the ruling,'' said Christopher
Hamrick, a spokesman for the Illinois Association of HMOs. ``It's
hard to gauge its impact right now, but we're concerned that it
could result in higher costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for patients hailed the ruling, saying that it was a
powerful tool in holding HMOs accountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``HMOs are going to be much more cautious about denying needed
medical care,'' said John Cameron, the executive director of
Citizen Action, an Illinois group that advocates for consumer
rights. ``This ruling is part of an increasing trend that
recognizes that HMOs are practicing medicine, even though they
don't have license on the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the laws in California and Texas that allow patients to
sue HMOs, laws in Georgia and Louisiana give patients a mechanism
to appeal HMO decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois suit was initially dismissed by a Cook County Court
judge, who ruled that the HMO could not be held responsible for the
actions of doctors who were not their employees, but rather
independent contractors.
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois Supreme Court did not rule on the merits of the
case, but decided the woman's survivors were entitled to a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for United Health Group, the Minneapolis-based parent
company of Share Health Plan, have said that they will not comment
until they can study the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Bilandic, who served as mayor of Chicago briefly after the death
of Richard J. Daley in 1976, said the Share Health Plan had
advertised itself as more than simply an insurer. He noted the HMO
had billed itself as the source of ``all your health care needs,''
and a ``good partner in sickness and health.''
</P>
<P>
   Politicians in the Illinois Legislature, as in many other
states, have been debating whether to allow patients to sue HMOs. A
bill signed in August by Illinois Gov. George Ryan, broadened the
rights of patients but did not address the question of whether
patients could sue HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Mary Flowers, who supported giving consumers the
right to sue, said many patients have come to see HMOs as arrogant
and callous.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good first step,'' said Ms. Flowers, Democrat of
Chicago. ``HMOs have not had any accountability. That's wrong. We
expect and deserve due process in this country. When we feel we've
been harmed, we ought to have the right to do something about it.''

<P>
   Federer ran the resulting magazine, Sky and Telescope, with a
firm hand for 33 years. It was a business but also a passion for
him. As editor in chief, he was seldom out of the magazine's
offices in Cambridge, Mass., and even when he was, he was usually
not far away (he lived next door).
</P>
<P>
   Then, as now, Sky and Telescope offered news about discoveries
and trends in astronomy, how-to articles and regular features like
sky maps and equipment reviews. It was not the slickest of
magazines, but it soon became a bible for amateur astronomers,
serving to unify people engaged in the largely solitary pursuit of
stargazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to build as large a community of amateur astronomers
in the United States as possible,'' said Leif J. Robinson, the
current editor in chief of the magazine, which now has a
circulation of about 125,000. ``Sky and Telescope was the vehicle
to connect them.''
</P>
<P>
   Federer had a good grasp of business, said Dennis di Cicco, who
was one of the last staff members Federer hired before his
retirement, in 1974. ``But he never attempted to maximize the money
gain from the magazine,'' di Cicco said. ``He never ran it with the
idea, `This is how I'm going to make my fortune.' He ran it for the
readers.''
</P>
<P>
   Federer taught himself astronomy as a child, observing the stars
from the family's home in Redding, Conn. In the 1930s he earned a
degree in physics from the City College of New York, taking classes
at night while working as an insurance underwriter.
</P>
<P>
   By the middle of the decade he had quit his insurance job and
become a staff assistant and lecturer at the new Hayden Planetarium
at the American Museum of Natural History, and secretary of the
Amateur Astronomers Association of New York, which he had helped
found.
</P>
<P>
   The museum approached him and his wife, Helen Spence Federer,
who also worked at the planetarium, about taking over The Sky, a
publication of the museum that it could no longer afford to
support. The Federers agreed, and were provided an office in the
planetarium's basement, a mailing list of 4,200, and $1,980 from
prepaid subscriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Several years later, at the suggestion of Harlow Shapley,
director of the Harvard Observatory, they also took over The
Telescope, a journal being produced in Cambridge. They moved to
Massachusetts and produced the first issue of Sky and Telescope in
1941. It was essentially a mom-and-pop operation at first, and even
as the magazine grew, Federer's management style remained very much
hands-on.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was something of a taskmaster,'' said Bill Shawcross, a
former president and publisher of the magazine. ``He always strove
for perfection. He and the rest of the staff were able to read the
astronomical literature, talk to astronomers and pretty much get it
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Federer's first marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by his
wife, Marion Wilcox Korab Federer; a son, C. Anthony Federer of
Durham, N.H.; a daughter, Barbara Meredith of London; four
grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.

ASHBROOK TALKED TO POLICE CHIEF OVER THE YEARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB MAHLBURG 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Larry Gene Ashbrook, the jobless loner who
killed seven people and fatally shot himself at a Baptist church,
rarely talked to his neighbors or even his family. But he spoke
regularly with someone else: Police Chief Thomas Windham.
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook called Windham off and on for years and once visited
Windham's office for rambling conversations about unemployment, his
years in the Navy and concerns that police might be following him,
Windham said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Windham said he talked with Ashbrook at least four or five
times, the last occasion just a few months before the shootings.
Windham said Ashbrook sounded lonely and paranoid, but never
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't make anything out of it other than, here's a guy who
lost his job,'' Windham said. ``He always seemed like a nice enough
guy to me. It's an understatement now to say that's a misperception
of him, but nothing in those conversations would ever signal he was
a violent individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook walked into Wedgwood Baptist Church in Fort Worth with
two handguns, denounced the Baptist faith and opened fire at youth
meeting Sept. 15. In addition to the people he killed, he wounded
seven more.
</P>
<P>
   After the shootings, Windham said, he told police officials and
the city manager about the conversations. He said he didn't reveal
them publicly until a reporter asked Friday because he feared that
it would disrupt the city's emotional healing.
</P>
<P>
   Windham said he began talking to Ashbrook about 1990, when
Ashbrook called to say he believed that he had lost a job because
police had gone to his workplace and that police were following
him. Windham said he assured Ashbrook that neither allegation was
true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a number of conversations with him after that,'' Windham
said. ``He would call me on occasion. It was very interesting,
because he would never tell me who he was. He would just start a
conversation. Eventually, I picked up on things he said, and I'd
say, `Larry, you rascal, how you doing?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Windham said he hadn't heard from Ashbrook in several years when
Ashbrook called him a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `How are you doing?' He said: `Not too good. My father
died.' I said, `I'm very sorry to hear that.' He said: `All he left
me was debts. I don't have a job. I haven't worked for years, and I
guess I'm going to lose my house because it's not paid for, and I
don't have any way to pay for it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't angry, and he really wasn't distraught. It was just
a voice of concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook never mentioned guns, religion, family or friends,
Windham said.
</P>
<P>
   In one previous talk, the chief said, Ashbrook claimed that he
was being followed by police and was mistaken for a serial killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He expressed a little concern that people would think he's a
serial killer. I said, `Larry, no one would think you're a serial
killer. An officer may have thought you fit a description.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ashbrook expressed similar fears in calls and letters to the
Star-Telegram and FWWeekly, an alternative newspaper. But Windham
said Ashbrook seemed ``just a guy who needed someone to talk
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Windham said it is not unusual for him to spend time reassuring
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get calls at the office from people who are distraught about
personal issues, financial issues, and I talk to them,'' he said.
``That may be a surprise to people, but that's the way I operate.''
</P>
<P>
   Windham, who has been praised for being accessible to the
public, said he regularly talks with ``probably half a dozen''
people like Ashbrook.
</P>
<P>
   Windham said he didn't consider urging Ashbrook to seek
professional help. ``Obviously, hindsight would suggest that, but
it never struck me I should,'' he said. ``The only advice I ever
gave him was, just because he lost one job doesn't mean he couldn't
get another.''
</P>
<P>
   Windham said he invited Ashbrook to his office after their first
chat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came into the office and he was very well-presented: He was
very clean, very starched, well-groomed. He looked to me like a
typical middle-class worker,'' Windham said. ``I don't think
anyone's incapable of violence, but he struck me as someone
unlikely to do violence.''

DUCKS OPEN ON THE ROAD _ AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's enough to make a team wonder if the NHL schedule-makers
have something against them.
</P>
<P>
   The Mighty Ducks, a perfect 0-6 in season openers, begin on the
road for a sixth consecutive season tonight in Dallas against the
1998-99 Stanley Cup champions. A Stars team that is 19-4-1 in their
last 24 games against Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   And they might have to open without Paul Kariya (left quad) and
Kevin Haller (knee), who both remain questionable for tonight's
game.
</P>
<P>
   Goalie Guy Hebert, the only Duck to have been on the roster for
the six previous openers, didn't really want to discuss Anaheim's
opening-night woes. But Hebert, who is 0-5 in openers, couldn't
help himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someday we will win our first game,'' he said with a grin.
``Every year the odds get more in our favor.''
</P>
<P>
   It sure seems so. The Ducks would tie a NHL record for
season-opening futility with a loss tonight. The Minnesota North
Stars lost seven straight openers from 1972-78.
</P>
<P>
   Other Ducks haven't gone through what Hebert has and they insist
they don't worry about such a streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``No points on opening night... nobody even talks about,'' said
Teemu Selanne.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter,'' said Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg. ``I
don't think about the past, I just worry about Saturday's game.
There's nothing I can do about the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks might be in a state of denial, but they seem eager to
prove themselves against a team that has dominated the series since
Anaheim won the first three games between the two clubs back in
1993-94.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be great,'' said Selanne. ``It would be a great
way to build confidence, to beat Dallas right away.''
</P>
<P>
   For Kariya, such confidence is a big factor in the Ducks taking
the next step up the NHL ladder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think Dallas or Detroit ever goes into a game thinking
they are going to lose?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's why Hartsburg and the players aren't overly
concerned about Kariya not playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a good team, we have to play without our top guys,''
said Hebert.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Kariya played all 82 games. Selanne missed seven and
the Ducks went 5-2 in his absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't miss him (Kariya) for a game or two, it doesn't
say much about our character,'' said Hartsburg. ``A lot of other
teams don't have (unsigned) free agents. You have to find a way to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Selanne and Kariya, if he plays, will face a Dallas team that
will be without two veteran defensemen. Craig Ludwig retired and
Richard Matvichuk, a holdout who signed a four-year contract
Friday, might not be in the lineup.

 By CAROL MARIE CROPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ When last we left her, Anna Nicole Smith, the
Playboy centerfold and former Guess jeans model, was at war over
how to hold a proper funeral for her husband, J. Howard Marshall
II, the Texas oilman who was one of the richest people in America
when he died at age 90.
</P>
<P>
   That 1995 feud, with one of Marshall's sons, was never really
settled. They wound up holding two services and dividing the dead
man's ashes.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Ms. Smith has battled drug addiction; suffered as
snide journalists published photographs of her weighing more than
200 pounds; filed for bankruptcy protection, and gave up both the
Cypress, Texas, ranchette and the Los Angeles house that her
husband had given her.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she lives with her young son by a previous marriage in a
modest apartment in this decidedly unglamorous Los Angeles suburb,
trying to stage a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   But her luck may be about to change. Ms. Smith, the
5-foot-11-inch Marilyn Monroe wannabe, is back down to her vamping
weight of 155. She is also on the edge of what could be a major
legal victory in her struggle to win a huge chunk of the Marshall
estate from E. Pierce Marshall, the stepson who fought her over her
husband's remains.
</P>
<P>
   If she wins, Ms. Smith, now 31, could become one of the richest
women in America. The estate is estimated to be worth more than $1
billion, and she hopes to get as much as half. The bulk of it is in
stock in Koch Industries, the nation's second-largest private
company, so Ms. Smith, a ninth-grade dropout from tiny Mexia,
Texas, could conceivably wind up with a seat on Koch's board and a
say in the Koch family's own long-running and much-litigated feud.
The Marshall clan controls 8 percent of Koch's voting stock and 16
percent of the nonvoting stock.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, the Koch family of Wichita, Kan., has been drawn
into the Marshall estate battle. A disinherited Marshall son, J.
Howard Marshall III, 63, has sued the Koch company, its chairman
and other Koch associates, accusing them of conspiring with his
brother, Pierce, to influence his father and cheat him of his
inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Cordes, a lawyer for Koch Industries and himself a
defendant in Howard Marshall's suit, called such claims
``completely meritless.'' Referring to Howard's dead father, Cordes
said, ``I don't know how any individual could have influenced J.
Howard Marshall to do anything that he didn't want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce Marshall, meanwhile, remains the heir, and he seems
unlikely to settle with Ms. Smith, the stepmother he detested, or
with his estranged brother. His lawyers maintain that, if anything,
Ms. Smith owes money to the estate, given her lavish life style and
the way it drained millions of her husband's fortune during his
last months.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 1 percent of American estates wind up in litigation,
according to Stanley Johanson, a professor at the University of
Texas School of Law. But this one has all the ingredients of a
spectacular fight: An enormous amount at stake, a disinherited
child, a new wife who is not the mother of the children. ``That's
the kind of case where you could say, `Anticipate a will
contest,''' Johanson said.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Ms. Smith seemed more intent on pouting
for a photographer than discussing her prospects in the trial in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Los Angeles, scheduled to begin on Oct.
25. (The estate battle became an issue in bankruptcy court after
Ms. Smith listed her claim to part of the fortune as an asset in
her personal bankruptcy filing in 1996.)
</P>
<P>
   She pleaded ignorance of the legal details _ or unwillingness to
discuss them _ while leaning forward obligingly in a low-cut black
knit dress for the camera.
</P>
<P>
   But one look at a May ruling by Judge Samuel L. Bufford of the
Los Angeles Bankruptcy Court makes it clear that Ms. Smith, who was
married to Marshall for 14 months, approaches the trial date with a
huge advantage. In a slap at Pierce Marshall for refusing to
cooperate in pretrial discovery, Bufford ruled that Ms. Smith
should share equally in proceeds from the estate.
</P>
<P>
   If the ruling stands, it will give Ms. Smith, a one-time Playboy
video star, more than enough to bankroll her dream of opening her
own film studio, one where innocent, less sexually explicit movies
like those from the 1950s could be produced. ``That's kind of weird
coming from me,'' she acknowledged. But referring to sexual content
on TV and in films, she said, ``It's just gotten out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith said she would be happy to both direct and star in,
and perhaps even write, movies with scripts like those of the old
Marilyn Monroe films. She, of course, would play the Marilyn parts.
</P>
<P>
   Through his lawyers, Pierce Marshall, 60, who lives quietly in
Dallas managing the family investments, refused requests for an
interview to discuss how he would feel if half of his Yale-educated
father's estate were to go to such an enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   But Rusty Hardin, a lawyer for Marshall Petroleum, a holding
company containing most of the Marshall fortune, had more to say.
``This is ludicrous,'' he said. ``This woman is not entitled to a
dime. And nobody who rationally looks at this case would give it to
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a very brief relationship with a man who was pleased
by her appearance,'' Hardin added, dismissively. ``And that's
all.''
</P>
<P>
   In his quest for the Marshall millions, J. Howard Marshall III,
the older son and the founder of an electronic instruments company,
is suing in Houston probate court to overturn his father's will and
a family trust that benefits his brother Pierce and Pierce's
family. In this effort, Howard is also suing Koch Industries.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Marshall and Ms. Smith make similar arguments in their
suits. Each says the elder Howard Marshall orally promised to
remember them in his will, but that Pierce Marshall interfered. Ms.
Smith goes further, saying that signatures on 1994 documents
amending the Marshall trust and gave Pierce Marshall his father's
power of attorney were not really those of her late husband, or
were obtained through fraud or duress.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce Marshall's lawyers brushed aside the contentions of oral
promises. ``Pierce's position is that J. Howard Marshall II's will
should be followed,'' said Don Jackson, one of Pierce's lawyers.
Referring to Ms. Smith by her real name, he said, ``He did not
leave anything to Vickie Marshall, or to his older son, J. Howard
Marshall.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 amendment to the Marshall trust, dated just two weeks
after Ms. Smith's marriage to Marshall, specifically excludes his
older son from the benefits of the trust. It makes no mention of
his young wife.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce Marshall's distaste for his flamboyant stepmother became
clear even before his father's death in August 1995. According to
Ms. Smith, Pierce, as co-trustee of the family trust, failed to
cover a $956,000 check that his father had written to a Beverly
Hills jeweler to buy jewelry for her. The jeweler then sued Ms.
Smith and the elder Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   When her husband's deteriorating health left him bedridden, Ms.
Smith appeared on the ``Howard Stern'' show to complain that her
stepson was restricting her to 30-minute visits once a day with her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   During a court battle for guardianship of the dying man, she
contended that Pierce Marshall had so starved the couple for cash
that ``one of the wealthiest men in America and his wife have had
the water turned off in residences for nonpayment.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith's remarks on Stern's show were among those Pierce
cited in a 1995 slander and libel suit against her and two of her
lawyers. The claim against her was discharged last month by the
bankruptcy court; the two lawyers settled.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith now says she forgives him. ``I have no harsh feelings
for anybody, not even Pierce,'' she said. ``It's a peaceful
feeling.''

HEARING LOSS DOESN'T SLOW DEFENSIVE END
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC ZARATE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Defensive end Casey Wines expects to see the
largest crowd of the season Friday when his Arlington (Texas) Colts
take on the Arlington Lamar Vikings at Cravens Field.
</P>
<P>
   His senses can also expect the pungent odor of freshly trod
grass chunks, the glint of stadium lights on band instruments and,
perhaps, the end-over-end flight of the football during a field
goal.
</P>
<P>
   The sounds of the game, however, are missing for this Arlington
High senior. Wines is profoundly deaf _ 90-percent hearing loss _
in both ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like (playing football), and it's fun,'' said Wines, who
reads lips when you look directly at him. ``This doesn't hold me
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not.
</P>
<P>
   Wines is a two-year starter for the Colts, and his coaches and
teammates regard him as one of the most tenacious players on the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great one to have in your program,'' Arlington High
coach Mickey Finley said. ``I think he kind of motivates us all
sometimes and is a great inspiration. Besides that, he's a great
football player and helps our football team. He's one of the best
football players we've got.''
</P>
<P>
   Wines' 34 tackles tie him for second-best on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's aggressive as anything,'' linebacker Lath Staats said.
``He's always going 110 percent. He just goes. He's awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Wines lost his hearing between the ages of 3 and 4, said his
mother, Leigh Anne Drake.
</P>
<P>
   ``His speech was developed, so that helped him read lips,''
Drake said, ``but he says he does not remember hearing at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In the classroom, where Wines wears hearing aids and has been in
the mainstream curriculum most of his life, he is almost painfully
shy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Casey's withdrawn in unfamiliar surroundings,'' Drake said.
``I try to make him do things on his own. He registered for school
on his own this year. I was pretty proud of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Wines played linebacker last year, but works closest with
defensive ends coach Jason Blevins this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been times when I'm coaching him and he gets
frustrated,'' Blevins said. ``I think he'll agree just so I'll go
on. He never gives any excuses and he's real hard on himself. He
bounces back and tries even harder on the next play, and the
players see this.''
</P>
<P>
   Hand signals from the sideline tell Wines what to do on each
play. Wines also looks back a second time in case Blevins wants to
add a stunt or warn his end about something else.
</P>
<P>
   A touch of the shoe by Blevins alerts Wines to a possible
bootleg. When the coach moves his arms like a pair of windshield
wipers, Wines looks for the reverse.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been real effective,'' Blevins said.
</P>
<P>
   Wines has played football since the fifth grade, and would like
to play at the college level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to make tackles and I love taking on the blocks,''
Wines said. ``No, I don't really get discouraged. If I miss the
play, I'll still go hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The sights and movement of football are enough for Wines, while
his mother also enjoys the sounds of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me proud when he makes a tackle and the crowd
cheers,'' Drake said. ``He can't hear it, but I sure can.''

 BURBANK, Calif.: peaceful feeling.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How much Pierce Marshall values Ms. Smith's forgiveness is
uncertain. What is clear is that the bankruptcy judge presiding
over her case takes a less beneficent view of him.
</P>
<P>
   Bufford slammed Pierce Marshall after finding that he had
destroyed some documents and refused to produce others showing what
happened to his father's assets after 1990, and that he had refused
to appear for depositions. As punishment, the judge upheld Ms.
Smith's contention that her husband had directed Pierce to equally
share proceeds from the Marshall estate with her. He said Pierce
had lost his chance to argue the point.
</P>
<P>
   Such a dramatic action, known among lawyers as a ``death
penalty'' sanction, is within the court's power but ``a bit
unusual,'' especially given that the California bankruptcy ruling
would make moot part of an active Texas probate case, said Dan
Bussel, a professor of law at the University of California at Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, neither Ms. Smith's nor Howard Marshall's claim
for a share of the estate seems strong. Texas law does not honor
oral contracts to make a will. Ms. Smith's filings alternately
argue that under the Texas community property law, she should at
least get half the income generated by the Marshall fortune during
her marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Marshall acknowledges that his father threatened to
disinherit him in 1980, after the younger man joined with dissident
sons in the Koch family to take control of Koch Industries, where
his father had been on the board for years.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Marshall and his father apparently remained on hostile
terms afterward. In a June 1999 filing, Howard Marshall said his
father had a habit of ``entering into oral contracts and breaching
such contracts if he felt like doing so.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Howard Marshall says his father agreed to treat him
equally as part of a bargain struck in return for his Koch stock,
which he sold back to his father rather than pooling it with the
Koch family dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   No one in the Koch family responded to requests for comment on
the Marshall lawsuits or their impact on Koch Industries, including
the prospect of Ms. Smith becoming a major shareholder and board
member. However, Cordes, the Koch Industries lawyer, said it was
unlikely that Ms. Smith would be given a board seat even if she
managed to win her case.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he said, much of the Marshall estate's Koch stock will
probably be sold to settle claims against the estate, with Koch
Industries having a right of first refusal. ``She has a long way to
go before she gets Koch stock,'' Cordes said. ``Nobody's staying up
late at night and worrying about it.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Ms. Smith said her husband not only promised her
half his estate, but was also planning to adopt her son, Daniel. In
proposing marriage, she said in a filing, her husband told her she
needed to be married to him so that he could provide for her and
``protect her from Pierce.''
</P>
<P>
   Within days of the marriage, she contended, her husband directed
his advisers to change his estate plan in keeping with his pledge.
Instead, she said, they ``began planning a series of false and
fraudulent transactions'' to permit Pierce to seize control of his
father's assets.
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 documents giving Pierce control of the trust bear an
illegible scrawl of a signature, made, she said, at a time when her
husband's eyesight was so poor that he could not have read what was
put before him.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith described her late husband, whom she called Paw-Paw,
as her ``security blanket.'' Referring to her days as a topless
dancer in Houston, trying to support her son, she said: ``He had
taken me out of this bad place. I loved him deeply for that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People can think what they want. I really don't care,'' she
said. ``He's the only person who ever cared for me in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   After her husband's death, with lawsuits mounting and Pierce
Marshall cutting off her support, ``I just lost it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was taking over 100 pills a day,'' she added. ``I got fat. I
was having seizures. I was having panic attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   During this period, the media were sometimes vicious. A
photograph of her at her heaviest, bulging out of a red evening
gown, turned up repeatedly in magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Her emotional condition may help explain the disappearance of
more than $3 million worth of jewelry given to her by Marshall
before he died. A court-appointed examiner in 1996 found Ms. Smith
so addled by prescription drugs and alcohol that it would have been
easy for people around her to steal the jewels.
</P>
<P>
   Business associates described Ms. Smith as ``naive'' and
``childlike,'' said the examiner, who added that she was surrounded
by people motivated by their own self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce Marshall offered a different explanation for the missing
jewels. ``The debtor may have simply manufactured the disappearance
to prevent the jewelry from becoming estate property upon her
bankruptcy filing,'' he argued in court documents.
</P>
<P>
   After fours years of court battles, a settlement that could put
an end to the protracted fight seems as distant as ever. With case
files already swelling in two states, ``It has become a
full-employment act for lawyers in Texas and California,'' said
Hardin, the Marshall Petroleum lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith says she hopes something good comes of the Oct. 25
trial. ``I'm praying to the good Lord,'' she said. ``I just want
this to be over with.''
</P>
<P>
   But her career seems foremost in her mind. ``I'm reading
scripts,'' she said. ``I'm thinking about a perfume line. And I'd
love to do another jeans contract.''
</P>
<P>
   And, like virtually everyone else in America, she is setting up
a Web site. One of the items to be auctioned on the site, she said,
is the infamous red gown.

DAFOE, BRUINS MAY YET LET ARBITRATOR SETTLE IMPASSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH AND NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It's possible a solution to the Byron Dafoe contract
stalemate could be right around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins president/general manager Harry Sinden says he is willing
to give Dafoe a second crack at arbitration if the league, the
Players Association, and Dafoe agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a chance to go to arbitration and didn't do it,'' said
Sinden Friday, two days after his No. 1 netminder asked to be
traded when the team and player clearly couldn't come to terms.
``That's why we have arbitration in our collective bargaining
agreement. It's there for the player who doesn't think he is going
to get a fair shake. Now, here's what I'll do. I'll gladly go to an
arbitrator as soon as possible if Byron is willing, and take
whatever the award is and live with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's no problem with the league or the Players
Association, and I don't think there would be, let's get an
arbitrator, submit our offers from both sides, and see what he
decides. Byron said if he knew this (impasse) was going to happen,
he would have taken arbitration. I'm giving him a second shot at
it. And since he said he wanted to be traded, we haven't had a
single call from anybody because there isn't a single team out
there willing to pay him what he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, it's a win-win situation for the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   From a public relations perspective, it would be positive for
management because people would credit the Bruins with finding a
solution to the impasse. It is also, in Sinden's eyes, a calculated
risk. Sinden has maintained that he thought Dafoe would get far
less in arbitration (between $2.2 million and $2.6 million) than
the Bruins were offering ($3 million). Sinden said he thought Dafoe
knew that, and that's the real reason he didn't seek arbitration
when he was eligible to file prior to July 15.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe said he elected to pass on having a third party decide his
fate because he thought he and his agent, Ron Salcer, could sway
the Bruins after the club made such a positive initial offer in
late June. As it turned out, the Bruins didn't move off their
offer, and Dafoe continues to sit as the season is set to begin at
the FleetCenter Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe was pleased with Sinden's idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronnie and I were actually talking about going to him with
that approach,'' said Dafoe. ``I'd definitely be open to that
because we honestly thought they wouldn't take it. That's exactly
what we were thinking about doing. That definitely could be an
alternative. There aren't really too many other options out there
the way it's going. I'm glad he said that. At least we both agree
to that, if anything, so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe said he didn't think it would be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``If both parties agree, it's like settling out of court, why
couldn't you?'' he said. ``I shouldn't say settling out of court,
but it's two parties going to an arbitrator because you and the
parties tried to work it out a different way but it didn't work.
That's definitely an alternative that could work. The bottom line
is if you go to an arbitrator and no matter what the award is,
whether it's good or bad for either party, you accept it because
supposedly it's fair.''
</P>
<P>
   A stumbling block, however, could be that this proposal flies in
the face of the collective bargaining agreement. The deadline for
arbitration has passed. It would take a special exception to do
this, and commissioner Gary Bettman might not want to open that can
of worms.
</P>
<P>
   If the league didn't allow it, it's possible the Bruins and
Dafoe could hire a private arbitrator to end the dispute.

WAS POPE PIUS XII A SAINT, OR HITLER'S PAWN? 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some Roman Catholic leaders are pushing to have Pope
Pius XII declared a saint. By contrast, John Cornwell, in the title
of his new book, calls Pius ``Hitler's Pope.''
</P>
<P>
   Are those the alternatives? There is a lot of room between being
a saint and being Hitler's pope. Which is where one can find most
of the knowledgeable historians.
</P>
<P>
   Chatting in his room at the Regency Hotel in Manhattan last
Monday, his tie loosened and his feet up on the bed, Cornwell made
it clear he was not a historian. He is a British journalist, whose
interests have run from the history and philosophy of science to
grisly murders and tales of demonic possession.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, he published ``A Thief in the Night'' (Simon &AMP;
Schuster), an investigation into the sudden death of Pope John Paul
I, which occurred scarcely a month (33 days) after his election in
August 1978. Cornwell's account sometimes made the Vatican look
like an HMO from hell, but the book was a model of common-sense
reporting compared with the conspiratorial fancies that other
writers concocted about John Paul I's unexpected demise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitler's Pope'' (Viking, 1999) is quite another matter. The
author plunges through territory that has been raked over by
painstaking historians as well as Pius XII's many critics and
defenders. Cornwell's distinctive contribution, he said on Monday,
was simply to paint ``the first full portrait.''
</P>
<P>
   The book also shifts the story's center of gravity from the
familiar debate about Pius' ``silence,'' his refusal to voice a
loud and unambiguous condemnation of Nazi deeds during the war and
Holocaust, to the less familiar debate about the church's fateful
dealings with Hitler during the months when the Nazi regime was
consolidating its dictatorial powers.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1933, the German Catholic Center Party voted for the
Enabling Act affirming those powers, and, four months later, voted
itself out of existence.
</P>
<P>
   Also in March, the German Catholic bishops lifted their previous
censures of Nazism. Immediately afterward, Hitler and the Vatican
moved to sign a concordat, an agreement regulating church-state
affairs that removed the German church from politics in exchange
for pledges of Nazi non-interference in church matters, which
Hitler, of course, violated.
</P>
<P>
   Orchestrating it all, according to ``Hitler's Pope,'' was
Eugenio Pacelli, the Vatican secretary of state who would be
elected Pope Pius XII in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   He may have hated Nazism, Cornwell acknowledges, he may even
have risked the most serious reprisals by later abetting a plot to
depose Hitler in 1939, but ultimately he spent his life in the grip
of a ``papal ideology'' that subordinated everything, including
resistance to Hitler, to the extension of papal control over the
rest of the Catholic church.
</P>
<P>
   This may come as a surprise to Catholics and non-Catholics alike
who assume that papal claims to govern the church were centuries
old. In principle, yes; but in practice, those claims were hedged
by concessions to Europe's monarchies and local officials, both
religious and secular.
</P>
<P>
   Following the traumas of the French Revolution and its
aftermath, when two popes were taken captive and humiliated by
Napoleon and when anti-clerical politicians frequently replaced the
old dynasties, the papacy became militant about asserting its
claims against state restrictions and local prerogatives.
</P>
<P>
   All his life, Pius XII surely held this exalted view of papal
power and a corresponding distrust of independent Catholic
movements. He was austere, solitary, a problematic figure
undoubtedly more at home with authoritarian leaders than democrats.
But was that all there was to him?
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to lean heavily on reputable scholars,'' Cornwell
said on Monday. And to get through the thicket of German historical
debates, he has leaned most heavily on Klaus Scholder, whose two
volumes on ``The Churches and the Third Reich'' (Fortress Press)
have been available in English since 1988, three years after his
death.
</P>
<P>
   Footnote after crucial footnote refers to Scholder, who is
certainly a reputable scholar, but not the only one in the fray.
Others insist that protecting Catholic schools was always the
uppermost consideration for both the Vatican and the German bishops
in the pursuit of a German concordat, not nominating bishops or
imposing canon law. Or they argue that the Center Party, Catholic
trade unions and other political church groups were already
buckling under the Nazi mix of emergency powers and street-level
terror. The Vatican was simply salvaging what it could.
</P>
<P>
   Did other groups, not burdened by a code of canon law,
concordats or Vatican diplomacy, do better in resisting Hitler? The
German Protestant churches? The Catholic church in France? The
other German political parties?
</P>
<P>
   ``A fair criticism up to a point,'' Cornwell said of his book's
lack of comparisons, which results almost inevitably from the
author's skill in keeping Pacelli always in the foreground. If Pius
XII was ``Hitler's pawn,'' as Cornwell writes, then everyone else
was Pacelli's pawn. No one seems to act from motives or principles,
virtues or vices, independent of his _ not the German bishops, the
Center Party leaders or even Pius' predecessor, Pius XI. One
chapter describes the young Pacelli's hand in the negotiation of a
June 1914 concordat with Serbia, and the reader ends up wondering
whether this man did not also start World War I!
</P>
<P>
   Clifford Longley, a veteran English religion writer, in an
article in the London Daily Telegraph, calls ``Hitler's Pope'' a
book about the present, not the past, a book whose ``real target is
Pope John Paul II.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfair, said Cornwell, although his book closes with a chapter
titled ``Pius XII Redivivus,'' attacking John Paul for reaffirming
``the ideology of papal power.''
</P>
<P>
   The real issue of course is not the disagreements among
Catholics over the current pope's leadership, but whether fighting
them out over Pius' dead body does an injustice both to him and to
the memory of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pacelli was no monster,'' Cornwell says in his book, and he
repeated that on Monday. But the author misses no opportunity to
portray a man obsessed by papal power, harboring a secret antipathy
to Jews, insensible to pity, narcissistic and self-exonerating.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic church used to assign a church official to
relentlessly pursue any possible unworthiness of a person proposed
for sainthood. That position was called the ``devil's advocate.''
John Cornwell, by his own admission, is not a historian. But he
certainly makes a superb devil's advocate.

 &HT;    After 2 years in making, Thrashers ready to go
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The South's first major-league experiment with this
sport from the northern provinces concluded with an ugly exit.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Flames lost their final game at the Omni, ousted
from the playoffs by a 5-2 New York Rangers victory April 12, 1980.
The owner, Tom Cousins, needed cash to support his sagging
real-estate interests and jumped on a $16 million offer.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the team was shoved into a moving van bound for Calgary,
and the NHL's existence in Atlanta was over after eight seasons and
not nearly that many playoff victories.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, all memories of the city's NHL cameo can, like the
Omni, be imploded.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers make their regular-season debut at Philips Arena
against the New Jersey Devils, a matchup of teams expected to have
opposite seasons. The Devils led the Eastern Conference in
victories last season. The Thrashers led the league in scouting
backup goaltenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that this has been building for a long time,''
said Thrashers coach Curt Fraser, a second-year player in Vancouver
at the time of the Flames' departure. ``But as a team we don't want
to get hung up in all that too much. We just want to go out and
play a game. Training camp was great, but it's training camp. This
is the real thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The NHL took Time Warner's $80 million expansion fee and
returned no favors. The Thrashers open with a three-game homestand
against three teams expected to contend for the Stanley Cup _ New
Jersey, which won it in 1995 and has averaged 47 victories the past
three seasons; Detroit, which won Cups in 1997 and '98; and
Buffalo, a finalist last year with the world's best goaltender,
Dominik Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser's team is expected to rely on goaltending and defense.
And perhaps he could find solace in the Thrashers' 6-1 exhibition
victory over the Devils two weeks ago. But New Jersey did not play
a number of its front-line players, most notably goalie Martin
Brodeur. Fraser even suggested the Devils might have sleep-skated
on purpose, to set up a sneak attack tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Jersey knew they were going to play us in the first game,
so they weren't going to show us anything,'' Fraser said. ``I know
what they're all about. I'm sure they wanted us feeling pretty good
about ourself. But they don't need to do that. They're a great
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Thrashers defenseman Kevin Dean, plucked from New Jersey during
the expansion draft, doesn't quite subscribe to Fraser's conspiracy
theory. ``I think we'd be the last team that could be lured into a
false sense of security,'' Dean said. ``That would be pretty
foolish of them, if that was their plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils will be missing two players, center Brendan Morrison
and left winger Patrik Elias, both of whom are restricted free
agents and playing for a club team in the Czech Republic. But the
Devils have an attack deep enough to pressure goalie Damian Rhodes
and play more of a wide-open style under coach Robbie Ftorek than
they did under Jacques Lemaire.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end, the Thrashers' aggressive forechecking system
will be given its first severe test. The forwards will be trying to
create more scoring attempts against Brodeur than they did against
Carolina and Nashville in the last two exhibitions, both shutout
losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we have to go all out every game,'' said left winger
Denny Lambert, a member of expansion Nashville last season. ``We're
not like Colorado or New York or Detroit. They can take a night off
and still win 3-2. If we take a night off, it's going to be 6-1 the
other way. We want to set the tone right off the bat. We want to be
physical and be in their face. We want other teams thinking, `These
guys don't give up.'''
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Gord Murphy agreed. ``We want to make it tough for
teams to come into our building,'' Murphy said. ``We want to make
it so that if teams come in and beat us, they're going to be pretty
fatigued and sore when it's over.''

 &HT;    Whitesell's debut works for Gordon
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARTINSVILLE, Va. _ Brian Whitesell was the center of attention
for his sensational debut at Martinsville Speedway on Friday, but
he wasn't driving.
</P>
<P>
   Whitesell, 35, replaced Ray Evernham this week as the No. 24
team's crew chief. With the new guy on the headsets, Jeff Gordon
earned a prime starting position in Sunday's NAPA AutoCare 500 by
qualifying fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today went real well,'' Gordon said with a smile. ``Obviously,
the results are there. We were fifth, (which) is the best we've
qualified here in a little while.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is certainly a lot of pressure on (Whitesell) and,
really, the whole team. So it was a big relief to have a good
qualifying run. We had no problems, and everything was smooth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was the first challenge _ it went real well _ and the
next is calling the race on Sunday. I don't expect anything to be
different Sunday than it was today.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitesell was heavily watched from the moment he entered the
track gate at 6 a.m. Friday. Despite stepping into the most
prolific crew chief job in Cup racing, Whitesell gave the
appearance of being calm and unassuming, yet confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The promotion) has not sunk in yet and there is too much work
to be done to get nervous,'' Whitesell said. ``I'm not really
worried about this weekend, but I want to make sure to do
everything right. Ray taught us very well, and we're going to do
the best we can and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Only after qualifying did Whitesell admit he felt like he was in
an awkward situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing interviews is the biggest thing,'' Whitesell said. ``I'm
over here with reporters, and the car is over there. I want to be
working on the car, but I've got great people who can do it, and I
can rely on them. That is the way that it has got to be from now
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Landing the job was the culmination of Whitesell's rapid rise
through Hendrick Motorsports. He arrived at the organization with
Gordon and Evernham in 1992, working as transporter driver, timer,
scorer and chassis technician during the first season.

 &HT;    A Case of good timing
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Baltimore Ravens quarterback Stoney Case owes the
Indianapolis Colts a long thank-you note.
</P>
<P>
   Case opened training camp in July as a backup in Indianapolis
after signing a two-year contract with the Colts. But he was
stunned when the team waived him after the preseason opener, in
which he completed five of six passes.
</P>
<P>
   It was a blessing in disguise.
</P>
<P>
   In Indianapolis, Case wasn't going to get much playing time
behind starter Peyton Manning, the only NFL quarterback to take
every snap last season. When he signed with Baltimore, Case had a
legitimate chance of starting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tremendous opportunity,'' said Case, who kept a
$500,000 signing bonus from Indianapolis. ``I guess I owe the Colts
a favor. It sounds strange saying that now.''
</P>
<P>
   New Ravens coach Brian Billick traded for Scott Mitchell and
Tony Banks, who last season lost their starting jobs in Detroit and
St. Louis, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   After leading the Ravens to last-minute victories in the final
two preseason games, it took Case only two regular-season games to
leap-frog Banks and win Mitchell's starting job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of surprised, because I missed the first three
weeks of training camp (with Baltimore),'' Case said. ``I was in
Indianapolis. I got a late start in learning the offense. Those
guys had the whole offseason, all summer and the first couple of
weeks of training camp to learn the offense. I had a lot of
catching up to do. When I got released from Indy, I was coming here
to get a job and make the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Billick's decision is one of the few breaks Case has received in
his five-year NFL career. A third-round pick of the Arizona
Cardinals in 1995 from New Mexico, Case expected to study under
veteran Dave Krieg and then take over the offense in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But Cardinals coach Buddy Ryan was fired during Case's rookie
season, and the new coaching staff had little regard for Case.
Under coach Vince Tobin, Case spent the next year and a half behind
Boomer Esiason and Kent Graham.
</P>
<P>
   When Arizona drafted Jake Plummer in 1997, it became clear that
Case's future wasn't in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   It might be in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Harbaugh, who started in Baltimore last season, signed with
San Diego in the offseason, and backup Eric Zeier was traded to
Tampa Bay. Billick gave up four future draft picks for Mitchell and
Banks, but both struggled in learning his sophisticated offense.
</P>
<P>
   After Mitchell threw four interceptions and was sacked six times
in the first two games, Billick turned over his offense to Case.
</P>
<P>
   In his first start against Cleveland last week, Case was shaky.
He completed 12 of 25 passes with three interceptions, but he
rushed for 57 yards and two touchdowns. Case was sacked four times
and amassed a passer rating of 30.0 against the Browns, who gave up
69 points in their first two games.
</P>
<P>
   But he directed Baltimore to a 17-10 victory, something Mitchell
couldn't do in the first two games. Billick said that result is
reason enough to stick with Case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't make the change to Stoney as a temporary situation,''
Billick said. ``He has everything a quarterback needs to succeed:
size, speed, vision, arm strength, confidence and intelligence.
We're giving him this opportunity. If he hits his stride and uses
all of his abilities, we could have a heck of a quarterback here.''

 &HT;    3 tied for lead at Buick
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINE MOUNTAIN, Ga. _ Those Ryder Cup players are news hogs. One
falls out of the picture at the Buick Challenge and another grabs a
headline.
</P>
<P>
   Friday was Jeff Maggert's turn at Callaway Gardens. Hal Sutton's
partner at Brookline, Maggert is flourishing back on his own. The
Houston resident shot a 9-under par 63 to move to within two shots
of leaders David Toms, Stuart Appleby and Harrison Frazar.
</P>
<P>
   Ryder Cup teammate Justin Leonard, after a 67 Thursday, shot a
72 in his second round and is at 5-under 139. First-round leader
Bob Friend shot a 73 and fell to four shots off the lead at 6-under
138.
</P>
<P>
   The cut came at 2-under 142, pushing 70 players to the weekend.
Among those missing were John Daly, Curtis Strange, Nick Faldo,
Atlanta's Billy Andrade and defending champion Steve Elkington.
</P>
<P>
   Maggert was surprised he could manage a 10-birdie performance
Friday, but not that he would regroup from last week's emotional
drain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't get any more relaxing than this tournament,'' he
said. ``You've got a cabin in the woods, a little baseball on TV at
night ... it doesn't get any better than this.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the players to catch at 10-under-par 134, Frazar is the only
one without a tournament win. Frazar, who has a pair of 67s, has
been friends with Leonard since they were children in Texas. The
two have not had an opportunity to discuss what happened in
Brookline.
</P>
<P>
   Frazar and Toms are not in the physical condition you might
expect from co-leaders entering weekend play. Frazar has a thick
bandage on his left wrist from a possible stress fracture and needs
to keep the ball out of the rough to minimize pounding. Toms, who
shot a 66 Friday, had to withdraw from the Wednesday pro-am because
of severe pain in his neck and back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying not to swing too hard,'' said Toms, who won
the Sprint International in August.
</P>
<P>
   Appleby, who shot a 64 Friday, is showing the fatigue of a long
season. He won the Shell Houston Open in May, his first since the
death of his wife, Renay, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just very tiring this time of the year,'' said the
Australian. ``But you've got to do the last few laps.'' Tom Kite,
with a 65, and Trinidad's Stephen Ames join Maggert at 8-under, a
stroke better than Columbus resident Larry Mize (69). Sea Island's
Davis Love III continued his strong play following the Ryder Cup
with a 68 that placed him at 138. Teammate Steve Pate (73) is at
3-under 141, along with Duluth's Stewart Cink (68).

<P>
   TOKAIMURA, Japan _ For years, Tomi Oshiro lived practically in
the shadows of this town's nuclear fuel plant, yet she and most
people in town had little inkling of the perilous work going on
inside.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery ended abruptly Thursday, when the fuel-reprocessing
plant suffered the worst nuclear accident in Japanese history. Ms.
Oshiro returned from shopping to find helicopters buzzing madly
above her house. It was several hours later before she was warned
of the full dimensions of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am furious,'' she said, adding that ``this incident was
incomparably more serious'' than previous accidents in the town,
which is the home to more than a dozen nuclear research and
production sites, including Japan's first nuclear power plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took place right next to peoples' houses,'' she said, ``and
still it took a long time before people were warned or any
emergency measures were taken.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oshiro spoke on a sidewalk less than hour after the
government declared that the danger had ended and told the 313,000
people living within a six-mile radius of the plant that they no
longer needed to stay indoors.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving her home for the first time in 24 hours, she expressed
her profound distrust of the government's handling of nuclear
safety. But in Tokyo, some 90 miles away, senior officials labored
to convey the impression of a return to normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that this should not lead to worries about the
nation's nuclear policy,'' said Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu
Nonaka, who acknowledged the government's slow handling of the
crisis but tried to allay concerns about the safety of Japan's
nuclear power industry, anxieties held both inside and outside the
country.
</P>
<P>
   But with people like the townspeople in Tokaimura, those in
civic groups around the country and independent experts in Tokyo,
government credibility had hit rock bottom, provoking cries for
everything from abandoning the nuclear industry altogether to a
sweeping overhaul of the industry, which provides nearly a third of
Japan's electrical power.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Tokaimura interviewed by phone while barricaded in
their homes, or caught on the street in the first minutes after the
ban on going outside was lifted Friday afternoon, expressed their
anger and disbelief that safety precautions could have been so lax
and that the government could have minimized the accident in the
crucial first hours.
</P>
<P>
   There was an accident two years ago that the town handled
calmly, said Kazuko Hagiya, the director of Tokai Hospital, just
two miles from the plant. ``We never realized the situation was so
serious this time,'' he said. ``I didn't close the windows right
away. Some patients didn't know anything about the accident, and
kept their windows open until they were warned, late in the
afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Yukio Hosogai, a ruddy hospital refrigerator technician who was
walking his dog, Hayato, said he learned of the accident in a call
from his wife around noon, but was surprised to see civilian cars
driving through the area two hours later.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, walking in an abandoned roadway, dozens of
white-suited nuclear clean-up workers combed the rice fields
nearby, using Geiger counters to measure radiation levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly speaking, I will never get rid of the anxieties that
come from living here,'' he said, ``and if I could get rid of
everything today and move somewhere else, I would. But I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Tokaimura once thought that the town of about
33,000 inhabitants had been lucky to become the home of Japan's
nuclear industry, beginning in the 1950s. Before that, it had been
a poor pearl in a string of what the Japanese call company castle
towns, meaning towns dominated by a single corporation, in this
case Hitachi.
</P>
<P>
   First came the country's first nuclear lab, then its first
reactor, then its first nuclear fuel-processing plants, and
finally, its first breeder reactor, which uses plutonium rather
than the uranium fuel and is theoretically self-sustaining.
</P>
<P>
   Little by little, residents in this coastal area _ with deep
green rice fields, peaked tile-roofed houses and the country's
characteristic commercial sprawl _ began to realize the costs
associated with the new industry.
</P>
<P>
   This realization exploded into the public consciousness here and
throughout Japan in 1995 with a huge leak of radioactive coolant at
the breeder plant in Tokaimura and again two years later with a
fire at another fuel-reprocessing plant here that exposed 37
workers to radiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few of us tried to sound the alarms of danger from this
industry starting way back,'' said Osamu Yatabe, a lawyer who once
represented the district in the National Assembly. ``We were always
in the minority though, because officials were able to convince
people that accidents like Chernobyl and Three Mile Island could
never happen here. Japan's safety precautions were in fact perfect,
they said.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tokyo on Friday, independent nuclear experts and civic groups
ridiculed the government's contention that the uncontrolled
reaction, in a privately owned uranium-reprocessing plant, did not
reflect on the overall safety of Japan's huge nuclear energy
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Even one senior official, International Trade and Industry
Minister Kaoru Yosano, took exception to the prevailing official
line, saying he was more concerned about ``psychological damage''
to the public than any economic impact. ``I am worried that the
unthinkable critical accident may throw cold water on the public
trust in nuclear facilities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One the most critical stances, though, came from Greenpeace
Japan, which said it was starting a campaign to force the
government to phase out the nuclear industry.
</P>
<P>
   Others may have stopped short of a demand like that, which has
little prospect of being realized, but insisted on sweeping changes
and were no less scathing in their dismissal of government
explanations of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about such reassurances by the government, Kiyoshi
Sakurai, a former researcher at the state-run Atomic Energy
Research Institute said: ``Nonsense. Safety management or
operational management of other nuclear facilities has a lot in
common with this plant _ that is, the system is designed in ways
that allow workers to intervene easily in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   According to most accounts of the accident, a flash of blue
light and a critical chain reaction of nuclear fission were
produced when workers inside the plant put five times the amount of
uranium in an acid solution-filled processing container than is
normally allowed. Three of those workers are among the critically
injured, altogether 49 people were exposed to radiation.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction was eventually contained when emergency workers
managed to break a drainage pipe for the container holding the
fissionable material. Later, emergency crews douses the
contaminated site with radiation-absorbing chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many in the public say that this accident must have been
caused by a procedural infractions, but I do not buy that,'' said
Keiji Koyabashi, a scientist at the Research Reactor Institute of
Kyoto University.
</P>
<P>
   ``In nuclear power matters, there should always be fail-safes,''
he said. ``Even if a mistake occurs, safety must be assured.''

GORE AND BRADLEY TAKE AIM AT EACH OTHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for complete writethru to reorganize and make additions
throughout. No pickup.)  (th) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The debates that Vice President Al Gore and former
Sen. Bill Bradley are promising began in a virtual way Friday as
each candidate pleaded with an important labor union for support
and directly criticized his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   In his strongest words to date about Bradley, Gore cast the
former senator's brief flirtation with an independent presidential
candidacy in 1996 as disloyalty to the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been tempted to leave the Democratic Party,'' Gore
said, speaking by satellite from Washington to members of Local 250
of the Health Care Workers Union, who were meeting in Oakland,
Calif. ``I've never been tempted to turn my back on the Democratic
Party. I've never been tempted to run as an independent and divide
the progressive coalition, and I have always, always been for
working families and for organizing.''
</P>
<P>
   In a videotaped appearance before the union, which played for
members earlier Friday, Bradley suggested that Gore could not get
elected because independents and Republicans would not support him
in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The objective of nominating somebody is to win in the fall,''
Bradley said. ``Since January, people have come up to me, in hotels
and restaurants, and said, `I'm an independent or a Republican and
I would vote for you and I would never vote for him,''' Bradley
said, citing a recent poll that showed Bradley beating Bush in New
York while the Republican would beat Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The comments marked the first time the two have criticized each
other directly to the same audience and signaled an escalation of
Gore's determination to fight for his party's nomination. When the
two made separate appearances last weekend before the Democratic
National Committee they did not aim their fire at each other.
</P>
<P>
   The comments also showed just how hard both candidates are
courting the labor vote. The union, a part of the Service Employees
International Union, is the second-largest health-care workers
local in the country after Local 1199 in New York. It is a critical
part of the AFL-CIO, which is scheduled to meet Oct. 12 in Los
Angeles. At that meeting, the AFL-CIO will consider whether to
endorse a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Gore once expected the endorsement, but Bradley's fund-raising
prowess and strong showing in opinion polls has given him enough
clout to at least forestall an automatic nod to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism of Bradley was just one sign Friday that Gore was
trying to make good on his pledge to revitalize his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He also replaced his top pollster, Mark Penn, with Harrison
Hickman, a move that the Gore camp described as a way to focus more
closely on polling in the early-voting states of Iowa and New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters have very particular views in those states,'' a
campaign aide said, describing Hickman as an expert in polling
specific issues and voters rather than broad national sentiment.
``You need research that is very, very targeted,'' the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was also more overt in his criticism of Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas, the Republican front-runner. For the first time Friday,
he mentioned Bush by name, indicating that Gore believes that
although he must beat back the Bradley challenge, he must also
carry the party standard against the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   At a hospital here, Gore touted his support for a patient's bill
of rights and chided Bush for not supporting one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that Governor Bush will break with the Republican
majority in the Congress and start supporting the patient's bill of
rights,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also said that Bush, who on Thursday said congressional
Republicans should not ``balance their budget on the backs of the
poor,'' could not simultaneously oppose the Republican spending
plan and still support their proposed tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   And the vice president said that if Bush really wanted to
``demonstrate compassion for working families,'' he would break
with the Republicans and support an increase in the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who was in Washington to address the Christian Coalition,
seemed surprised that Gore had mentioned him. ``Really?'' he asked
a reporter when informed of Gore's comments. ``What did he say?''
When told, Bush said, ``Well, I think that Vice President Gore
needs to debate Bill Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore thinks so too. He has called for debates every two weeks.
On Friday, the Bradley campaign sent a letter thanking the Gore
camp for its ``sudden interest'' in joint appearances.
</P>
<P>
   In their comments to the health-care workers, Gore and Bradley
gave a taste of how they planned to engage each other and present
their differences.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley portrayed Gore as a life-long Washington insider with
little real-life experience. ``The vice president has a life that
is primarily based in Washington, and I think that gives us a
different idea of who the American people are, and what we can
do,'' Bradley said. ``I think it also flows into a different style
of leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's comments about Bradley's loyalty to the party stem from
statements he made four years ago. After he announced in 1995 that
he would not run for a fourth term for the Senate, Bradley declared
the political system ``broken.'' The comment reflected his feeling
then that Congress had become too partisan and controlled by
big-money and special interests.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1995, he delivered a keynote address at a Liberal
Party dinner in New York and said he had ``not ruled out'' an
independent candidacy, especially after a series of discussions
with other independents, like Lowell Weicker, a former senator from
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bradley insisted at the time that his discussions were
``not groundwork for a formal third-party challenge to the
two-party system,'' and in the last month he has said that he never
seriously considered a third-party candidacy.

TXU TO SELL SIX TEXAS GENERATING PLANTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAN PILLER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ TXU Electric has hung a ``For Sale'' sign on
the generating plant that has stood guard over the north side of
downtown Fort Worth for 47 years.
</P>
<P>
   The 55-acre North Main plant is one of six TXU generating plants
offered in Texas. Other plants on the block are Mountain Creek and
Parkdale in Dallas, Lake Creek and Tradinghouse near Waco and
Rivercrest outside Mount Pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Mountain Creek units, built in 1945 and 1949, are older
than North Main in the TXU system.
</P>
<P>
   Even before TXU announced the sale Friday, North Main had ceased
to be a daily part of the utility's generating capacity. Three of
the four steam-driven turbines have been closed. The fourth, with
capacity of 80 megawatts, is used only during peak demand periods,
usually during the hottest days of a Texas summer.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the work of providing electricity to Fort Worth-Dallas
was assumed a decade ago by the Comanche Peak nuclear plant when it
opened in Somervell County near Glen Rose.
</P>
<P>
   North Main, like other generators, feeds directly into the
national electrical grid. Its output could potentially be sold
throughout Texas, although TXU spokeswoman Carol Peters said that
``economics always dictates that electricity be used as close to
its generation as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The plant has no permanently assigned employees. Peters said
that on occasions when North Main is restarted, TXU shifts workers
from other generators nearby.
</P>
<P>
   North Main and the other five plants are natural gas-fired,
steam-driven units. TXU (formerly Texas Electric Service Co.) says
it is selling the plants in anticipation of the deregulation of
electric service in Texas in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas is recognized as a very attractive market in which to
operate when competition begins, and many entities are expressing
interest in owning generating facilities in the state,'' TXU said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Potential buyers are likely to be other utilities or energy
companies seeking a piece of Texas' lucrative and growing
electricity market.
</P>
<P>
   After the plants are sold, TXU said, the utility will buy
electricity from other providers rather than relying solely on its
own generation.
</P>
<P>
   Deregulation will open up Texas' electricity market, including
TXU's 2.5 million residential customers in North and Central Texas,
to any and all electric providers. Monopolistic utilities such as
TXU, which already possess exclusive residential customer bases,
are expected to rely more on purchased rather than generated
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Outside corporations such as Calpine Corp. of San Jose, Calif.,
and Duke Energy of Charlotte, N.C., have announced plans to build
generating plants in Texas to sell power to utilities.
</P>
<P>
   TXU spokeswoman Peters said that TXU expects the North Main
plant to continue as a generator under its next ownership, and that
TXU could conceivably buy electricity from the generator it once
owned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generating plants don't just go away,'' she said. ``It is
conceivable that we would buy power from the next owner.''
</P>
<P>
   Although three of the four turbines are inactive, Peters said,
they could be re-equipped and started up again. The other three
turbines can each generate 80 megawatts of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   One megawatt can provide peak electricity power to 250 homes.
</P>
<P>
   The market for used electrical generators is considered strong.
Robert Rubin, an analyst at Bear Stearns &AMP; Co. in New York, told
Bloomberg News that ``this is a phenomenal time to sell. There's at
least 20 different companies that will be looking at the assets TXU
is offering for sale.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors viewed the potential sale favorably. While the Dow
Jones industrial average fell 63.90 Friday, TXU stock rose 3.2
percent to close up $1.19 at $38.50 per share.
</P>
<P>
   The strong potential market is the reason TXU expects to get
more than $1 billion for the six generators, although it carries
the plants on its balance sheet at $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The sale will leave TXU still with 18 generators. Another
generator, near downtown Dallas, is being taken out of service and
converted to a distribution center as part of the development of
the new Dallas sports arena.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the buildings, structures and wiring, North
Main's assets include land, water rights, emissions permits and
fuel transportation contracts. A levee on the Trinity River
protects the site from flooding, Peters said.
</P>
<P>
   TXU said it will sell the plants as a package, singly or in
smaller groups.
</P>
<P>
   The utility has hired Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. to conduct the sale.
No real estate brokers are involved.

EDITORIAL: JAPAN'S NUCLEAR LESSON 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Oct. 2:
</P>
<P>
   It was nowhere near as bad as the 1986 accident at the Chernobyl
nuclear reactor in Ukraine, which spewed radiation over a vast
territory. It was not even as scary as the 1979 accident at the
Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania, which had the
entire nation on edge wondering if the reactor core would break
through its confinement and reach the outer world. (It didn't.) But
the nuclear accident this week at a fuel processing plant at
Tokaimura was certainly the worst in Japan's history _ and a vivid
reminder that nuclear energy is a demanding technology that
severely punishes human error and inadequate technical designs.
</P>
<P>
   Just what went wrong will not be known until investigations are
complete and the Japanese make full disclosure. But from the
fragmentary and conflicting accounts now available, the accident
appears largely due to human error. Workers at a privately operated
plant who were preparing nuclear fuel poured far too much liquid
uranium into a small vessel, more than its design could safely
handle, with the result that a chain reaction started that released
lethal neutrons and fission products.
</P>
<P>
   There was apparently no real danger of a major explosion or
massive release of radiation that would contaminate large areas of
the countryside and threaten public health. The amount of uranium
present was too small for that, only some 35 pounds as compared
with the 50 to 100 tons in a power reactor. High doses of radiation
did escape outside the building into the immediate surroundings,
some 150 people nearby had to be evacuated, and more than 300,000
people living within six miles were told to stay in their homes.
But the chief danger was to workers inside the facility. At least
two received such high doses of radiation that they are likely to
die, barring a medical miracle.
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood of a comparable accident in this country is hard
to assess. ``Criticality'' accidents were once common in the United
States, occurring in plants other than reactors about once a year
on average in the two decades from 1945 to 1964. But there have
been none since 1978, an indication perhaps that nuclear engineers
have employed safer designs and nuclear technicians have learned to
be more careful. Still, an accident is hardly impossible here. As
recently as 1991, conditions conducive to criticality occurred at a
plant in North Carolina. The Japanese accident may have involved
fuel for a research reactor, which is susceptible to inadvertent
chain reactions in smaller quantities than power reactor fuel, but
it is not yet known whether the process that went awry is similar
to processes used to make such fuel in this country.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese government, which has been accused of cover-up
tendencies after previous nuclear accidents, will need to make full
and prompt disclosure of what happened at Tokaimura if it is to
maintain credibility and salvage its troubled nuclear industry. For
the United States, the main lesson may lie less in the particular
flaws and errors uncovered at Tokaimura than in the reminder that
it is alarmingly easy to get into trouble in the nuclear business
the minute one's guard is lowered. As the U.S. nuclear industry
continues to press for easier regulation and less stringent
standards, Tokaimura is a warning that too much relaxation can be
dangerous.

SAL SALVADOR, 73, TEACHER, BE-BOP GUITARIST AND KENTON PROTEGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The guitarist Sal Salvador, a warm-toned be-bop improviser who
performed with Stan Kenton, Bill Evans, Phil Woods and other
canonical jazz figures, died at a medical rehabilitation center in
Stamford, Conn., on Sept. 22. He was 73 and lived in Stamford.
</P>
<P>
   He died of cancer, said his daughter, Lorinda.
</P>
<P>
   Salvador, who was also an instructor and the author of many jazz
instruction books, was born in Monson, Mass. At the age of 18,
Salvador, whose name was originally Silvio Smiraglia, heard Charlie
Christian on a record and taught himself to play the guitar. With
his friends the saxophonist Phil Woods and the drummer Joe Morello,
he performed in Springfield, Mass., and was eventually hired by the
vibraphonist Terry Gibbs and the guitarist Mundell Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950 he became a staff musician at the Columbia label and two
years later went to work with Stan Kenton in his breakthrough job.
He left the band 18 months later but Kenton enabled Salvador to
make an LP for Capitol records under his own name, ``Kenton
Presents Sal Salvador,'' in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Kenton spotlighted him in the work ``Invention for Guitar and
Trumpet'' on the ``New Concepts of Artistry in Rhythm'' album, and
the piece was later included in the 1955 film ``Blackboard
Jungle.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1960 Salvador started his own big band, the Colors in Sound
Orchestra, which toured and recorded for five years. Later he
served as an accompanist to singers like Johnny Mathis and Paul
Anka.
</P>
<P>
   From 1970 until recently Salvador taught jazz at the University
of Bridgeport and Western Connecticut State University; he also
taught privately in New York City. In the 1990s he began recording
again with a small group for the Stash and Jazzmania, and he
performed in several recent JVC Jazz Festival concerts, usually in
duets with his longtime colleague Mundell Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his daughter, who lives in Stamford, he is
survived by his wife, Catherine D. Smiraglia; his sons, Daniel B.
Smiraglia of Stamford and Barry S. Smiraglia of Pepperill, Mass.,
and two grandchildren.

DYKES' TASK AT HAND ISN'T SAVING JOB (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUBBOCK, Texas _ Life was good in Coahoma for Sharon and Spike
Dykes that fall of 1964.
</P>
<P>
   They owned a ``new'' Volkswagen beetle with 150,000 miles, but
they generally got where they wanted to go. They lived in a
$10-a-month oil-field house (''They charged you $5 a bedroom, and
we had two bedrooms,'' Dykes recalled), but it was comfortably
appointed with castoffs from Sharon's father's furniture store in
Ballinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time they'd throw something away, we'd pick it up,''
Dykes recalled. ``We had a bunch of junk, I'm telling you.''
</P>
<P>
   Spike had just completed his first season as a head football
coach. He had taken over a team that was winless the year before
and guided it to 10 consecutive victories and a district
championship, though the Bulldogs lost the bi-district tussle to
Seagraves, 32-28.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was bulletproof and invisible,'' Dykes said.
</P>
<P>
   That is until that November afternoon when Sharon came through
the door of their home visibly upset. After several minutes of
urging, she finally blurted out the reason she had come home close
to tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spike,'' she said, ``they're after you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What? Who's after me?'' said Spike, stunned.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon said she overheard a conversation between two crusty old
ranchers while she was at the post office picking up the mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to do something about that coach,'' one of them had
said. ``If he'd played that other quarterback the other night, we'd
still be in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Dykes still laughs at the memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of those welcome-to-the-head-coaching-business
deals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The story recently has taken on added significance. Just a week
after Dykes became Texas Tech's winningest head coach with a
victory over Louisiana-Lafayette, Red Raiders fans were in an
uproar after a loss to North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old saying that things are never quite as good or as bad
as they seem is probably true,'' Dykes said. ``Everybody has an
answer for everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate over Dykes' future rages anew each day on Lubbock
radio and in the letters-to-the-editor section of the local paper,
unabated after an open date following the 21-14 loss to UNT on the
heels of the historic victory over Louisiana-Lafayette.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the antis are going to call more than the pros in any
circumstance,'' said longtime Lubbock radio announcer Jack Dale,
who does three daily sports-talk segments. ``But there are a ton of
anti-Spike Dykes people who want him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech president Donald Haragan last week said that Dykes, who is
in the next-to-last year of a contract, will remain through the end
of the season. Then, Haragan said, Dykes' status will be fully
evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are even more upset about that,'' Dale noted.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dykes goes about business as usual, getting his team
ready for what is perhaps the Red Raiders' biggest game of the
season today against fifth-ranked Texas A&AMP;M, one of college
football's winningest teams of the '90s. Tech has beaten the Aggies
in consecutive visits and four of the past six times A&AMP;M has played
in Lubbock.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Dykes has maintained the wit that both endears
and alienates, depending on one's point of view.
</P>
<P>
   At Tech's weekly news conference Monday, sports information
director Kent Partridge announced that he was out of this week's
passes for ``shooters,'' meaning sideline photographers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shooters, huh?'' Dykes observed. ``That's encouraging to
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in his lived-in office suite, Dykes addressed the
firestorm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider the sources,'' he said. ``Now if \Rformer boss\S
Darrell Royal calls me and tells me I'm doing a \Rbad\S job _ and
he might _ that would worry me.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're going to get this team ready to play, and I'm not
going to worry about what people are saying because I don't care. I
really don't. A lot of things are important to me _ things I hold
dear _ but \Rkeeping\S this job is way down the list. These kids
are a lot more important than this job.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Rob Peters, who has also taken his share of blame
for Tech's 1-2 start, said the players regrouped during the
off-week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, we found out a lot about ourselves,'' Peters said.
``We had a good team meeting. Some admitted they weren't playing
like they should. Others challenged some people. I believe we're
headed in the right direction. We realize we've got to have each
other. It's us against the world _ maybe even Lubbock.''
</P>
<P>
   Extenuating circumstances abound, though Tech fans are not
interested in debating them after what they consider to be the
inexcusable loss to the Mean Green. The most pertinent is the loss
of four of the Raiders' best offensive players _ tailback Ricky
Williams, fullback Sammy Morris and two offensive linemen _ in the
first half of the first game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they got off to a pretty good start in the Arizona
State game, and then they lose their guys and have to play without
them for a few weeks,'' A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum said. ``That makes a
huge difference.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People just don't realize what kind of an impact that had,''
Tech linebacker Kyle Shipley said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams re-injured the strained ligaments in his right knee in
practice Tuesday and is out for the season. But he is aware the
personnel losses have taken a toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``With me and Sammy, you're looking at two captains who bring a
lot of motivation and leadership to the team,'' he pointed out.
``But I think this team got it back last week \Rand is\S mentally
ready to play Texas A&AMP;M.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he also was surprised by fan reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how so many people can doubt \RDykes\S like they
are,'' he said. ``We've only lost two games. We can still win the
Big 12. We do that and a lot of people are going to look pretty
silly.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Dykes won't speak about it publicly, sources close to him
confirm that he would have retired two years ago if not for wanting
to see Tech through a four-year NCAA probation that has forced his
program to operate under an 80-scholarship limit and lose 18
initial grants through the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to get into all that,'' Dykes said with a wave
of the hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've enjoyed \R13 years as Tech's head coach\S. I love this
school. I love these kids. I'm going to have fun today. I'm going
to enjoy next week. I'm going to have a lot of fun until the last
day _ whenever that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not going to lay awake at night and worry about this
deal. No way.''
</P>
<P>
   At least Sharon and Spike get their mail at home now. nn

GAILEY: MCIVER WON'T PLAY TOMORROW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cowboys coach Chan Gailey officially ruled guard
Everett McIver (hamstring) out of tomorrow's game against the
Arizona Cardinals yesterday, but said that decisions on cornerback
Kevin Smith (back) and tackle Erik Williams (quad) won't be made
until right before the kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve guard Tony Hutson has been taking all the snaps this
week at right guard and will start in place of McIver.
</P>
<P>
   The decision on Williams could have the most impact for the
Cowboys. Though he is listed as probable for the game, he has not
taken many snaps in practice. Rookie Solomon Page got all the work
with the first-team offense yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said it was crucial for Page to get the repetitions in
practice. If Williams can't play, the Cowboys will at least have
the comfort of knowing they did everything they could to get Page
ready for a possible matchup with Cardinals defensive end Andre
Wadsworth.
</P>
<P>
   One of the factors in the game-day decision on Williams is
whether he can be more effective hobbled against the speedy
Wadsworth than an inexperienced Page.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said Smith had a good day of practice yesterday for the
third consecutive day. If he plays, he would back up Kevin Mathis
at left cornerback. nn

   STOCKS CONTINUE TO SLIDE ON STRONG ECONOMIC NEWS
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index on Friday was flat, rising
a mere 0.10 point, to 1,282.81. The index is up 4.36 this year and
had been down 10.6 percent this week from its July 16 high, putting
it into what Wall Street defines as a correction _ a selloff of 10
percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   Other market gauges resumed their slide after reports showed
that the economy's surging growth has not slowed in recent months.
The data renewed concerns that the Federal Reserve might raise
interest rates next week. The Dow Jones industrial average fell
63.95 points, to 10,273, and the NASDAQ composite index fell 9.31
points, to 2,736.85.

   NEW YORK CITY'S MILLENNIUM BOOKINGS ARE SLOW
</P>
<P>
   Bookings for the New Year's holiday have been slow in New York,
and there is at least the possibility that for hoteliers,
restaurateurs and impresarios, the party to end this or any other
century may turn out to be a bit of a bust. A new survey by the

that three-quarters of the 40 hotels that responded are not yet

   AETNA NAMES LIAISON TO DOCTORS
</P>
<P>
   Health insurer Aetna named a division president, John Kelly,
director of the company's new office of physician relations to help
bolster its ties with doctors. The creation of the unit comes after
the American Medical Association, among others, objected to Aetna's
$1 billion purchase of the Prudential Insurance Company of
America's health-insurance unit in August, saying it would hurt
competition in the managed health care market.
</P>
<P>
   MANUFACTURING GREW IN SEPTEMBER
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturing sector grew in September much more strongly
than expected, while prices of raw materials soared to the highest
level in more than four years. The report by the National
Association of Purchasing Management confirms that industry is
recovering from the Asian financial crisis and provides further
evidence that the economy rebounded from a sluggish second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   EURO ENDS WEEK UP 3.6 PERCENT AT $1.07
</P>
<P>
   The euro, the common currency adopted in January by 11 European
nations, jumped 3.6 percent this week. It reached $1.0767 in
European foreign-exchange trading, its highest level in eight
weeks, before settling in New York at $1.0728. European central
bankers have turned hawkish in the last few days, warning that
inflationary pressure might be rising again and that it might well
be necessary to cool things down with an increase in interest
rates. Wim Duisenberg, the central bank's president, said Europe's
outlook for growth had improved and dangers to price stability
should not be overlooked.

FROGS WON'T BE WELCOME IN `DOG HOUSE' (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TCU coach Dennis Franchione will introduce the Horned Frogs to
one of his old haunts tonight ... a charming arena in California's
San Joaquin Valley known affectionately as ``The Dog House.''
</P>
<P>
   Bulldog Stadium is the home of the Fresno State Bulldogs (2-2),
who _ along with the Frogs (1-2) _ are the favorites in the Western
Athletic Conference title race.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the engagement is therefore somewhat awkward,
since it is the conference opener for both teams. Properly
distressed by this development, Franchione's response is the
equivalent of, ``So what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a little bit early to be worrying about `title
showdowns,''' he said. ``There's a lot of football left, and the
way this league is, I don't think anyone is going to come through
without at least one loss, maybe two.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a good team, and this is an important game for us. But
as I told the team, it doesn't count more than any other game.''
</P>
<P>
   Franchione has adroitly sidestepped the suggestion that a
``rivalry'' is growing between the two schools, based on their
status as favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``A rivalry?'' he said. ``No, I don't sense any rivalry here. It
takes more than one game \Ra 21-10 TCU win last year\S to develop a
rivalry. Most of our kids have probably never even been to
California.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the chunk of California occupied by 41,000-seat
Bulldog Stadium, Franchione has been there, memorably.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went in there my first year at New Mexico \R1992\S,'' he
said, ``and I'll never forget it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had beaten New Mexico, 49-17, the year before, and I
guess they figured on an easy game. When we went in with a lead at
the half, it was like their fans became enraged. They were very
abusive, throwing things and screaming at us. I'm not even sure
they realized I was the head coach, but they knew I was from New
Mexico and it was one time when I was very grateful for the police
escort. We ended up losing by three points.''
</P>
<P>
   Fresno State coach Pat Hill has vowed to recreate the Bulldogs'
glory period of the 1980s, when they achieved success under coach
Jim Sweeney with quarterbacks like Kevin Sweeney (the coach's son)
and Trent Dilfer and were known as ``Wide Receiver U.''
</P>
<P>
   He also regards this as a rivalry, regardless of what the Frogs
think.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been waiting for this game for a year,'' he said. ``They
beat us down there last year and outplayed us, and they're an
exceptionally good program.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked for his evaluation of TCU's two-headed quarterback
monster, Hill replied, ``We're preparing for their starter, Patrick
Batteaux.''
</P>
<P>
   This despite the fact Batteaux didn't play last week due to a
hand injury and freshman Casey Printers is expected to start. nn

UCLA, ASU ARE DESPERATE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Both coaches have three daughters. Both worked
for John Robinson at USC, and both used to play the sax. But the
similarities don't end there for UCLA coach Bob Toledo and Arizona
State boss Bruce Snyder.
</P>
<P>
   Their teams, which meet today in Sun Devil Stadium, are united
in injury, they are united in defeat, and they are united in
desperation. When dusk falls and the desert shadows disappear, one
of them can make millennium plans. The Rose Bowl won't be an
option.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pivotal game,'' Toledo said. ``The winner still has an
outside shot at the Rose Bowl. The loser, in my opinion, is out of
the Rose Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   The loser will have two conference losses _ first-place Stanford
has none _ and while that doesn't guarantee elimination, it comes
pretty close. In the last 40 years, there have been just four
two-loss champions. The most recent was UCLA in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Stanford wins the head-to-head tiebreaker with UCLA
(2-2, 0-1) based on its victory last week. If the Bruins lose
today, they'll need Stanford to lose three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened when we lost to Stanford was we lost our margin
for error,'' Bruins safety Joey Strycula said. ``We still have a
legitimate shot at the Rose Bowl, but we have to win out. If we
lose (today), it's the Aloha Bowl or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Same for Arizona State (1-2, 0-1), which suffered the biggest
upset in Pac-10 history two weeks ago. A 25-point favorite, the Sun
Devils lost to New Mexico State by 28 points. Last week, they
wasted a fourth-quarter lead and lost to Cal 24-23.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we took a huge step in getting rid of (the New Mexico
State) loss,'' Snyder said. ``Maybe we still have little remnants.
But we have a chance to not carry it for the season. If we do,
it'll be like an anchor.''
</P>
<P>
   Predicaments aside, the Bruins and Sun Devils have plenty in
common:
</P>
<P>
   _Both have injured tailbacks. Arizona State's J.R. Redmond,
perhaps the best player in the Pac-10, has a slight shoulder
separation and practiced sparingly this week. Despite his official
status (questionable), Redmond told reporters he expects to play.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA tailback DeShaun Foster did not participate in contact
drills this week because of a sprained ankle suffered in the first
quarter at Stanford. Chances are, he'll play. But how long _ and
how effective he'll be _ is unknown. (Senior Keith Brown will start
at tailback for UCLA.)
</P>
<P>
   _Both have quarterbacks with bruised ribs, which means both are
one tackle from the training table. UCLA's Cory Paus has had two
weeks to recover and looked sharp in practice Thursday. ASU's Ryan
Kealy, who was injured at Cal, missed several practices early in
the week.
</P>
<P>
   _Both teams have inconsistent offenses _ partly the result of
injured quarterbacks _ and porous defenses. New Mexico State rushed
for 363 yards on Arizona State, while Stanford passed for 465
yards, a record for UCLA opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game will show a lot about the character of our team,''
Toledo said. ``And I hope it's good character.''
</P>
<P>
   If not, the Bruins will be home on New Year's.

   NEW YORK _ With a lengthening lineup of Hispanic political
leaders calling for the removal of Herman Badillo as chairman of
the City University of New York, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Gov.
George Pataki said Friday that they would stand by him, though they
described as inappropriate his remarks about Dominican and Mexican
students that ignited the uproar.
</P>
<P>
   A number of prominent Hispanic officials _ including Fernando
Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, Guillermo Linares, a Manhattan
councilman, Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez of the Bronx _ have
demanded Badillo's removal, saying remarks he made last week
demonstrate that he is racially insensitive and bigoted and not fit
to be CUNY's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Many who are calling for Badillo's dismissal have strongly
opposed the policies he has introduced at CUNY, including the
exclusion of remedial students from CUNY's bachelor's degree
programs, and his remarks last week gave them one more ground for
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Badillo's comments came in response to a question about how
immigrant children with little formal education should be taught,
and he explained that the city's middle schools face an influx of
students from the hills of the Dominican Republic and Mexico who
arrive with little formal education. He referred to the immigrants
as ``pure Indians _ Incas and Mayans who are about, you know, five
feet tall with straight hair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that in Mexico and Central America, there has
never been a tradition of education,'' he told the audience at a
lunch sponsored by the Center for Educational Innovation on Sept.
22.
</P>
<P>
   Badillo, who was born in Puerto Rico, two days later issued a
statement that stressed his role as ``passionate defender of
immigrant rights.'' He added: ``I know my words were wrong and I
apologize. My intent was to suggest assistance to the groups
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   But the apology did not quiet the criticism or calls for his
dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani acknowledged that Badillo had used ``wrong and
insensitive'' words in talking about immigrants but called the
attacks on Badillo politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a whole political agenda in trying to remove,''
Giuliani said. ``They are not trying to remove him because of the
remarks that he made, they are trying to remove him because they
don't like the policy and direction of CUNY, and this is a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Deister, a spokesman for Pataki, said the governor
continued to back Badillo. ``Obviously his remarks were
inappropriate and he's acknowledged that,'' the spokesman said,
``but that by no means overshadows his accomplishments or his
commitment to provide CUNY students with a better education.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor appoints 10 of CUNY's 17 trustees as well as the
chairman and vice chairman of the board. He named Badillo chairman
in late May.
</P>
<P>
   Badillo, who declined to be interviewed Friday, has been in a
battle with many leading Hispanic politicians for years. Once a
liberal Democrat who served as Bronx borough president and a
congressman in the late 1960's and early 70s, Badillo is seen as
having become more conservative in his views and he recently joined
the Republican Party and has expressed interest in running for
mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Some Hispanic leaders defended Badillo.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Ruben Diaz, president of the New York Hispanic Clergy
Organization, with more than 150 Hispanic ministers, said the
political leaders attacking Badillo were widening the splits in the
Hispanic community when they should be healing them. He argued that
while Badillo had used some inappropriate words, he had done more
for Hispanic people in the United States than anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Herman Badillo is not racist,'' Diaz said. ``He has helped
Dominicans. He has helped Puerto Ricans. They are using Herman
Badillo to advance their own political agenda.''

 A TALE HANGS IN THE TEST NUMBERS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 3)

   DETROIT _ Big cars and minivans produce sterling performances in
federal crash tests. Large sport utility vehicles, which tend to be
modified pickup trucks with very stiff bodies that absorb little
energy in a crash, often fare worse.
</P>
<P>
   When regulators crashed a new Chevrolet Impala sedan into a
concrete and steel barrier at 35 miles an hour recently, the dummy
in the driver's seat escaped largely unscathed. Measured on a point
scale in which 500 reflects a 1-in-25 chance of a life-threatening
injury and 1,000 indicates a greater than 1-in-6 chance, the dummy
in the Impala test suffered only 322 points' worth of harm.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, when a big Dodge Durango sport utility vehicle with
four-wheel drive took the same test last December, the dummy in the
driver's seat suffered head injuries scored at 1,008, as well as
severe chest injuries. It was the worst score for driver's head
injury of any recently tested vehicle and was particularly
dismaying to regulators because it was the second time they had
tested the Durango; DaimlerChrysler had made adjustments to the
vehicle after it scored equally poorly in the first test a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I look at the truck, it's beautiful, but my gosh, it does
let tremendous forces go into the dummy,'' said Richard Morgan, the
group leader of the government's New Car Assessment Program, which
runs the tests.
</P>
<P>
   The government conducts a separate test at 30 miles an hour
before letting any vehicle be sold in the United States. If the
Durango had recorded the same head- or chest-injury scores on the
slower test, it would have flunked and been ineligible for sale.
</P>
<P>
   But the slower test was never performed on the Durango; instead,
the government accepted DaimlerChrysler's assurances that the
Durango was virtually identical to the Dodge Dakota pickup truck,
which was tested and passed with good scores.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Gruber McLean, a DaimlerChrysler spokeswoman, said the
company had done many of its own safety tests on the Durango,
including the basic safety test at 30 miles an hour, and the
vehicle had always passed. ``We're confident this vehicle offers
adequate protection for its occupants and meets all the standards
it needs to meet, or exceeds them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McLean contended that federal crash tests at 35 miles an
hour are meant ``to reflect a Durango hitting a Durango, which is a
very rare crash.'' But regulators and the insurance industry
disagree, saying the tests also simulate what happens when a
vehicle hits a fixed object or another vehicle of similar size and
weight.
</P>
<P>
   The Durango was also rated ``acceptable'' in a somewhat
different test for the insurance industry, in which a vehicle hits
a barrier with its front, driver's-side corner, rather than with
its whole front as in the government test.
</P>
<P>
   Other sport utility vehicles have somewhat better crash test
scores than the Durango does for head and chest injuries, but do
worse on potentially crippling leg injuries. The Cadillac Escalade,
Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon Denali full-size sport utility
vehicles have the worst scores for injuries to drivers' legs of any
automobiles on the market that regulators have tested.
</P>
<P>
   The Jeep Grand Cherokee has the worst scores for injuries to
front passengers' legs, according to raw data from recent
government tests.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Volvo S-70 sedan and V-70 wagon have the best
scores on driver's head injury among currently available
automobiles of any type, while the Ford Windstar minivan does best
on chest injuries to drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Sport utilities do better than large cars and almost as well as
minivans on side-impact tests that the government recently began
conducting. Such side-impact crashes, although often deadly, are
much less common in the real world than frontal crashes.

   &UR;  &LR; DETROIT _ As the 2000 model year arrives, sport utility vehicles
have captured the hearts and garages of millions of Americans,
while sales of large cars and minivans are lagging.
</P>
<P>
   But many in the auto industry say there is an untold story:
large cars and minivans have been greatly improved. They actually
do as well as or better than sport utility vehicles by many of the
criteria American buyers have long considered most important. These
include price, performance, passenger comfort and, perhaps most
surprisingly, safety.
</P>
<P>
   The height and sturdy appearance of sport utility vehicles make
them seem safer than cars to many buyers. But in crashes, people in
the latest large cars and minivans are less likely to die than
people in all but the very largest sport utility vehicles,
according to an insurance industry analysis to be released this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Even the very largest sport utilities have death rates only
slightly lower than those of large cars and minivans, yet are far
more likely to kill occupants of other vehicles in crashes.
</P>
<P>
   The safety comparison goes beyond death rates. Recent federal
crash tests show that large cars like the Ford Crown Victoria and
Chevrolet Impala, and minivans like the Honda Odyssey and Ford
Windstar, provide more protection than large sport utility vehicles
like the Dodge Durango and the Cadillac Escalade.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, sport utility vehicles have received many of the worst
scores in recent tests and are more likely to roll over than cars
or minivans, according to a Federal study last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors that are important to buyers also favor large cars
and minivans over more popular sport utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Consider price. Auto makers sell large cars and minivans at thin
profit margins and often offer rebates. They tack markups of $5,000
on pickups and of $10,000 to $15,000 on large sport utility
vehicles, often with no rebates.
</P>
<P>
   Consider performance. The typical large car can now accelerate
from zero to 60 miles an hour in 9.2 seconds, almost 2 seconds
faster than a large sport utility vehicle, according to government
figures. And because large cars are lower and lighter, they tend to
be more nimble and to brake more quickly, especially on wet
surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Minivans, which are built like large cars but with taller
passenger compartments that produce more wind resistance, roughly
match large sport utility vehicles in acceleration times and handle
better, though not quite as well as cars.
</P>
<P>
   Consider spaciousness. Large cars and minivans offer leg room
and shoulder room similar to that of sport utility vehicles for
passengers in the front two rows of seats, and almost as much
headroom. Minivans also provide a third row of seats, as large
sport utilities do.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans care little these days about their vehicles' fuel
economy or emission of air pollutants, industry surveys show. But
on these criteria, too, large cars do far better than sport utility
vehicles, while minivans tend to be in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Strict government standards for cars have forced auto makers to
design large cars that now get up to 32 miles a gallon on the
highway. That is double the mileage of some of the biggest sport
utility vehicles, which are allowed by law to be considerably less
fuel efficient.
</P>
<P>
   Cars of all sizes also emit less than half the volume of
smog-causing gases for each mile that most large sport utility
vehicles do. (Ford now builds its sport utilities to pollute no
more than cars.)
</P>
<P>
   People who know automobiles usually say that big cars offer a
better combination of driving performance, affordability and
roominess than other large vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would steer most families toward a large sedan because they
provide the best cross-section of capabilities,'' said Csaba Csere,
editor in chief of Car and Driver magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Even auto makers, wealthy from sport utility profits,
acknowledge that big cars are underappreciated. ``Trucks are not as
nimble, they're not as light, and if you don't have the need for
the load-carrying capability or the three rows of seats, the
passenger cars are a great value and a lot of fun to drive,'' said
Ronald Boltz, a senior vice president at DaimlerChrysler AG.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, large cars have two substantial disadvantages when
compared with sport utility vehicles: they have less cargo space,
and they are not as tall. These days, Americans increasingly like
riding up high, or at least dislike being in short automobiles when
motorists around them are driving taller models.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the many advantages of the latest large cars and minivans
have not been much help to the people who market them because to
many Americans these products are something worse than less safe,
less economical or less nimble: They are out of fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, children liked to play with model sports cars
and dreamed of the day when they might drive the real things. But
auto industry market researchers now say that the younger a person
is, the more enthusiastic he or she is about sport utility
vehicles. That could shape the auto market for many years to come.
</P>
<P>
   When DaimlerChrysler held promotional events for its cars and
for its Jeeps recently in a Detroit suburb, visitors to the car
promotion mostly had gray hair or were balding. The Jeep display
across the street, which included an off-road driving course, was
full of families with children.
</P>
<P>
   Milo Perreault, 11, from Shelby Township, Mich., ogled the sport
utilities and spoke wistfully of the long wait until he would be
old enough to drive. ``I'd actually like a Jeep,'' he said. ``Some
of the sports cars, like the Viper, are low to the ground, and in a
Jeep I like the height.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, market researchers did not even ask about
height. Now surveys show that visibility from the driver's seat
ties a vehicle's driving performance and interior comfort as the
most important attributes that buyers seek.
</P>
<P>
   The taller sport utilities do well on this score, especially the
new Ford Excursion. It has just replaced the Chevrolet Suburban as
the world's largest sport utility vehicle, and at 6 feet 8 inches,
it allows tall drivers to look over the roofs of Suburbans.
Excursion drivers must climb two tall stairs and a short one just
to get in to the vehicle.

   Mary Cumberland, 76, who drives a big 1997 Chrysler New Yorker
and lives in Southfield, Mich., said she had always driven large
cars. But she was not sure that she wanted another because she was
tired of having other vehicles block her view of the road. ``A lot
of people are considering sport utilities just out of
self-defense,'' she said. ``I'm trying to get my husband to
consider a van, to be up higher.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest cars are low and streamlined, making them very stable
as well as reducing wind resistance and improving fuel efficiency.
But the seats and door openings in large cars are lower than they
were a generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion and seating height have contributed to the recent
stagnation in sales of large cars and minivans. Sales of large cars
have tumbled to 4 percent of the overall market, from 10 percent in
the early 1980s and from close to half the market in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Minivan sales, which had been hot and growing rapidly as
recently as the early 1990s, have now leveled off, and actually
lost some of their share of all new vehicles sold, falling to 8
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of sport utility vehicles, of course, have been soaring.
Though their annual growth rate peaked in 1996, the big vehicles
have still been the fastest-growing segment of the auto market
every year since 1994. Sport utility vehicles now account for a
majority of the luxury auto market and almost a fifth of the
overall market, up from less than 2 percent of each in the early
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Just by looking at sport utilities, some Americans conclude that
they are safer than cars and minivans. Their rugged, even
intimidating, appearance seems to remind buyers of the safety
advantages of size, an advantage that Americans used to forget in
buying small cars, said Adrian Lund, an insurance industry safety
researcher.
</P>
<P>
   But recent research by the government and the insurance industry
shows that, contrary to popular perception, sport utility vehicles
do not keep their occupants any safer than cars or minivans, or
even as safe in many cases.
</P>
<P>
   For example, large cars and minivans are increasingly winning
the government's highest, five-star rating for driver protection in
a frontal crash, but not one sport utility vehicle has won the
highest rating for such protection. And some of the worst safety
scores in crash tests have gone to sport utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the government assigns stars without assessing an
automobile's propensity to roll over. Sport utility vehicles and
pickup trucks fared worst in a federal study last summer that
looked at vehicles' tendency to roll over.
</P>
<P>
   The new insurance industry analysis, which included federal data
on every fatal crash reported in the United States last year, finds
that 106 occupants of large cars like the Impala and smaller
minivans like the Dodge Caravan died in crashes for every million
registered vehicles of those types.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, 131 occupants of large sport utility vehicles
like the Dodge Durango died in crashes for every million registered
automobiles of those types.
</P>
<P>
   For the very largest sport utility vehicles, like the Chevrolet
Suburban and the Lincoln Navigator, the death rate was slightly
lower than for large cars, at 93, while for midsize sport utility
vehicles like the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Chevrolet Blazer it was
much higher, at 151.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller minivans, like the Caravan, ended up being included
in the large car category in the study because they were similar in
wheelbase and construction and behaved similarly in crashes. Bigger
minivans, like the Windstar and Odyssey, wound up in the very large
car category, which also includes Lincoln Town Cars and which had a
death rate of 107.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ricardo Martinez, the administrator of the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration, said sport utility vehicles were no
safer for their occupants than other types of automobiles. ``It has
become a popular myth that the SUV is bigger and better, but we're
very concerned that people understand the tradeoffs,'' said
Martinez, a former emergency room physician. ``It's taller, and
that may help it in some kinds of crashes, but it also makes it
more likely to roll.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while people in sport utility vehicles die at least as
often as people in cars and minivans, they tend to die differently.
With minivans and cars, the fatalities tend to occur in collisions
with other vehicles, especially sport utility vehicles and pickup
trucks. But with sport utilities, deaths come relatively more often
when the vehicle rolls over.
</P>
<P>
   Sport utility vehicles also tend to provide much less protection
for occupants than cars during collisions with solid objects, as
when a vehicle slides on a slippery road and hits a bridge or tree.
</P>
<P>
   Data from recent government crash tests into solid barriers also
strongly suggest that sport utilities provide poor protection
during collisions with other sport utilities, although regulators
say they have never crashed sport utilities together to check.
</P>
<P>
   Sport utility vehicles fare better than other types of vehicles
in collisions with cars. The height and weight of a sport utility
vehicle allow it to pass over the strongest parts of a car and
penetrate deep into it, so that the car and its occupants absorb
the brunt of the crash, according to recent studies by regulators.
</P>
<P>
   But Martinez and other safety experts say it is a mistake to be
concerned only about collisions with cars. Indeed, surveys have
found that most drivers think their own driving skills are far
above average, and do not pay adequate attention to the possibility
that they will make mistakes themselves or encounter poor driving
conditions, like icy roads. Single-vehicle crashes account for
nearly half of all fatal accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Rollovers represent the biggest problem for sport utilities,
causing more than a third of all deaths in those vehicles, compared
with only a tenth of the deaths in cars. Recent federal research
has found very few cases in which vehicles roll over because their
owners swerve violently on a road. Instead, according to federal
research backed by auto makers' own findings, 92 percent of
rollovers occur after a vehicle has been ``tripped'' by striking a
curb, guard rail or another vehicle, or catches the wheels on one
side in the dirt or mud of a road's shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers should be concerned about all types of crashes, and not
just the possibility that a bad driver will crash into them,
Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to protecting their own occupants better than most
sport utilities do, large cars and minivans pose less hazard to
other motorists. They are only a third as likely to kill the other
driver in a crash as large sport utilities are, according to a
study to be published in the winter issue of the Journal of Crash
Prevention and Injury Control.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The height, stiffness and weight of sport utilities account for
the difference, according to the study, which was written by W.
Thomas Hollowell, a senior federal researcher, and his former aide,
H. Clay Gabler, now in academia.
</P>
<P>
   William Powers, Ford's vice president for research, said in a
speech on Aug. 5 that in the years ahead, motorists will ``see
increasing diversity in vehicle size, raising further issues in
occupant protection, vehicle-to-vehicle compatibility and
pedestrian protection. There is a lot of work yet to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, before tall automobiles became more common and
made visibility from the driver's seat an issue, Americans shopped
for the roomiest, best-handling vehicles at the best prices. If
that were still true, dealers would have trouble keeping cars and
minivans in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Large cars, minivans and big sport utility vehicles all cost
around $20,000 for carmakers to build, and a little more if they
are luxury models with lots of leather and fancy gadgets like
navigational computers.
</P>
<P>
   But while many large cars and minivans sell for under $26,000,
three-quarters of the nation's sport utility vehicles sell for more
than $26,000. The difference, analysts say, lies in the
manufacturers' fatter profit margins on sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Large cars and minivans offer seats that are just as roomy and
comfortable as sport utility vehicle seats _ more comfortable, if
the bumpy ride of sport utilities is considered. While large cars
these days may look smaller on the outside than the big sedans of
the 1970s, they are just as spacious on the inside. And while the
trunks of large cars may not accommodate tables and chairs, the
cargo areas of minivans do.
</P>
<P>
   Minivans have as much cargo room behind the second row of seats
as all but the largest sport utility vehicles, industry statistics
show. And because the second row of seats in most minivans can be
removed, while the second row in most sport utility vehicles can
only be folded down, minivans are actually the roomiest vehicles
for people with very large possessions to move.
</P>
<P>
   Many television advertisements show cars swooping through tight
curves on mountain roads. Ads for sport utility vehicles seldom
show this, for a good reason: sport utility vehicles are less
maneuverable than cars, or even minivans.
</P>
<P>
   Car and Driver magazine tests vehicles by having them swerve
over one lane to the left and then swerve back into their original
lane, as though circumventing an obstacle. The magazine found last
year that family sedans could accomplish the maneuver safely at
average speeds up to 63.4 miles an hour, and minivans up to 57.9
miles an hour; for luxury sport utility vehicles, the average was
53.9 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Csere said sport utilities' high centers of gravity, high weight
and off-road tires gave them inferior handling. ``SUV's are clearly
worse than cars of any kind, whether small or large,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer weight of sport utility vehicles also makes them
harder to stop than cars or minivans, especially on wet or snowy
roads. Indeed, Thomas Davis, General Motors' group vice president
for light trucks, said that, contrary to popular perception,
four-wheel drive does not help vehicles stop, nor does it help them
maneuver while braking.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the ways they compare favorably with sport
utilities, large cars and minivans suffer from an image problem.
Despite considerable improvements over the last five years,
especially in driving performance, minivans in particular are
unfairly derided, said Ralph Sarotte, DaimlerChrysler's general
manager for minivans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone put the `soccer mom' title on them, and a lot of
people don't want that image,'' he said. ``We could sell twice as
many minivans in this market if it were not for the image thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly that ``image thing'' is what makes sport utilities so
hot, auto executives say.
</P>
<P>
   ``SUVs are about image,'' said Joseph C. Collins Jr., Ford's
brand manager for sport utilities and minivans. ``It's about who
that customer is and who that customer wants to be.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Despite everything you may have heard about
millennium madness, out-of-towners have not booked every overpriced
hotel room in the city for New Year's Eve. They have not snapped up
every $3,000 seat in the Rainbow Room, purchased every $1,000
ticket to every ``gala'' event, hired every limousine _ or even
every baby sitter.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, despite all the hype, the puff, the ``reserve now or
you'll be ringing out the 20th century in Scranton'' threats,
bookings for the New Year's holiday have been slow. And there is at
least the possibility that for hoteliers, restaurateurs and
impresarios, the party to end this or any other century may turn
out to be a bit of a bust.
</P>
<P>
   Not a total bomb, of course. Reservations at hotels and
restaurants are still ahead of where they would be in a normal
year, and travel and tourism officials express confidence that
everything will be booked by the big night. A few events, like a
dinner at the American Museum of Natural History, have sold out.
But New Year's Eve has not, so far, been the blowout many expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's concern that it's not as strong as it was anticipated
to be,'' said one longtime hotel manager, who predicts that hotels
will start offering better deals in the weeks before New Year's
Eve.
</P>
<P>
   A new survey by the agency that oversees the city's tourism
efforts, NYC &AMP; Co., finds that three-quarters of the 40 hotels that
responded are not yet fully booked. Cristyne F. Lategano, on her
first day as president of the agency, said that many people are
only now beginning to nail down their plans for New Year's Eve,
adding, ``We expect this to be the greatest party ever thrown.''
</P>
<P>
   While most hotels are reluctant to reveal exactly how much (or
how little) of their space has been spoken for, the Hotel
Association of New York City says that ``most'' of its 158 members
are at least half full. A spot check of Manhattan hotels found
rooms available all over, even near Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   At the New York Hilton on Sixth Avenue at 53rd Street, rooms
start at $550 a night, about double the usual minimum charge. The
Waldorf-Astoria has rooms starting at $695 a night and $1,075
suites big enough for a private party (room service is extra). Even
the Marriott Marquis, which overlooks Times Square and received its
first request for a 1999 New Year's Eve reservation back in 1983,
just had some rooms open up after a group canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Sherpick of Baltimore was pleasantly surprised to find that
she could get a room at the Hilton _ she recently booked three, and
is bringing her husband's family from San Francisco. ``I think
we're a little crazy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations were clearly inflated at the Millennium Hotel on
44th Street. The hotel's management tried _ and failed _ to rent
the whole building to a single party giver. ``It's not inexpensive
to do, and nobody really had the budget for that,'' said Michael
Littler, vice president and general manager of the hotel. It still
has ``several handfuls'' of rooms available for New Year's Eve, at
prices of $695 a night for three nights; for a room with the view
of Times Square, add at least $150 a night.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are the hotels alone. Steven Leber, a theatrical producer
who hopes to lure 25,000 people to a party at the Javits Center,
reports that tickets (at $1,000 and $2,500) are still available.
``The scuttlebutt is that we're doing badly,'' he confided, but he
said that is not so though he will not reveal how many tickets have
been sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found people are just waiting longer than expected'' to
make their plans, Leber said, adding that many balked at hotels'
high rates and four-day minimum stays. So he has arranged for some
one-night-only rooms at $500. And he plans to step up the
advertising for the event, Celebration 2000, emphasizing all of its
wonders: performances by Sting, Aretha Franklin and Tom Jones, a
disco room, a big band room, and for its VIPs a menu created by
Jean-Georges Vongerichten. ``People are either going to say that I
must be a nut job,'' Leber said, ``or that this is the most fun
thing ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Many restaurants, from the elegant Union Square Cafe to the
boisterous Virgil's Real BBQ on 44th Street, are planning to close
that night. But others are still accepting reservations for
extravagant meals; the River Cafe, for example, has a multicourse
dinner for $2,500 a person.
</P>
<P>
   At Millennium Limousine Service, cars are still available,
though the minimum rental is for 10 hours, and there is ``nothing
for less than $900,'' said Brian Plaine, the owner, who plans to
have 30 cars on the road by year-end. ``Everybody increased the
prices so outrageously, people are waiting for the best deal,''
Plaine said. (He'd like to have a party, himself, he said, ``but
I'll probably be sitting in my office, pulling my hair out.'')
</P>
<P>
   Things have been busy at the Baby Sitters Guild, which provides
sitters for hotels and individual families. People have been
reserving child care since April, said Heidi Davalos, who used the
service for her own children before going to work there. Sitters
are still available, though the price is steep: $250, in advance,
for five hours, and about $30 an hour thereafter. ``It's going to
be a rough holiday,'' Ms. Davalos said. ``If you want people to
work, you have to offer them something mildly attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside of New York, Carnival Cruise Lines has hundreds of
cabins still available on a dozen millennial cruises in the
Caribbean and other points south. It turns out that most of the
trips were too long, said Jennifer de la Cruz, a spokeswoman for
Carnival. ``Most people have a limited amount of time.'' (Ms. de la
Cruz is planning to spend her New Year's Eve quietly with friends,
she said, though some of her siblings plan to travel.)
</P>
<P>
   A lack of vacation time and outrage over high prices were two of
the main reasons that 90 percent of Americans plan to stay put at
New Year's, according to a survey by Travel Weekly, a publication
for travel agents.
</P>
<P>
   And when people say they plan to stay at home, they literally
mean at home, according to a survey of more than 10,000 people done
by the Zagat restaurant-rating empire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventy percent said they wanted to be at home with friends
and family, which is the way I feel,'' said Tim Zagat, co-publisher
of the restaurant guides and chairman of NYC &AMP; Co., the city's
tourism agency. ``I probably shouldn't say this,'' Zagat said,
``but I want to be as far away from the city as possible and home
with my family.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who do want to go out on New Year's Eve want to be
somewhere extraordinary, like on top of Mount Everest, Zagat said.
</P>
<P>
   And for such people, believe it or not, New York City may not be
exotic enough. Take Margaret Barry, who works for the University of
Notre Dame in South Bend, Ind., but travels every chance she gets
to New York, where she worked for nine years. She considered
returning to the city for the big celebration, she said, ``But I
wanted to do something really different.'' Her New Year's Eve
destination: Warsaw.
</P>
<P>
   Even if some of the city's 55,000 hotel rooms remain vacant on
New Year's Eve, Times Square is unlikely to be noticeably empty
when the big ball drops. The crowd that traditionally attends tends
to be younger than the group that can afford to plunk down
thousands of dollars on hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   And while many New Yorkers say being in Times Square at midnight
has all the allure of riding the Lexington Avenue local _ only
colder _ in the past city dwellers have made up only about 15
percent of the crowd, according to a study done several years ago
by the Times Square Business Improvement District, which sponsors
the ball-drop and attendant hoopla. Most of the revelers come from
the tri-state region, and many are college students whose schools
are closed.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Times Square BID expects more than 1 million
people to attend at least some of the festivities, which begin at
6:30 a.m. on Dec. 31. At that early, chilly hour, ``it's not like
at midnight, but there will be a substantial crowd there,'' said
Peter Kohlmann, the executive producer of the event, who will spend
New Year's Eve in Times Square between 45th and 46th streets,
``watching everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the crowds have become increasingly well-behaved _ and
sober _ in recent years, the very idea of being packed in with a
million revelers may be a turn-off even to those most likely to
attend.
</P>
<P>
   Isa Ferguson, a 20-year-old college student living in Brooklyn,
would seem to be a likely candidate, given that she does not have
much money, but does not want to stay home. ``I keep thinking that
when my kids are asking me what did I do, I don't want to say,
`Well, I played Monopoly.'''
</P>
<P>
   So is she going to Times Square? ``Yeah, right,'' she said. ``I
don't think I want to be out,'' she added, confessing to a sneaking
suspicion that the so-called Y2K computer problem may really cause
at least limited problems when midnight rolls around.
</P>
<P>
   Even more sotto voce, some New Yorkers confess to a worry that
terrorists, publicity seekers or plain old nuts might think Times
Square on New Year's Eve is the perfect place to make an explosive
splash, as hundreds of millions of people watch on television.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials are reassuring: ``It will be business
as usual for us, because we are always in aggressive mode,
anyway,'' said Joseph Valiquette, a spokesman for the Federal
Bureau of Investigation. As for what he'll be doing, ``I guess I'll
be home,'' he said, ``I don't have any plans.''
</P>
<P>
   The high expenses that may keep some tourists out of the city
will also keep some New Yorkers home. Christine Kulisek, a
packaging designer, had planned to go to Mexico for the millennium,
but sky-high air fares changed her mind. Now she plans to have a
small black-tie dinner with friends and ``enjoy the Manhattan
festivities.''
</P>
<P>
   Does she plan to stop by Times Square? ``Oh no, I'll watch it on
TV,'' Ms. Kulisek said. ``Everybody there will be from out of town.
I don't think anyone from Manhattan will be anywhere near Times
Square, I really don't.''

   Dr. John J. Conley, a New York surgeon who made important
contributions to the treatment of cancers of the head and neck,
died on Sept. 21 in a hospital in Manhattan. He was 87 and lived on
the Upper West Side.
</P>
<P>
   Conley, an otolaryngologist, developed operations for improving
the speech of patients who had lost their voice boxes to cancer and
for reconstruction after the loss of the jawbone to cancer.
</P>
<P>
   He also developed operations for rehabilitating the larynx and
for grafting facial nerves. In addition, he developed the idea of
single-stage rehabilitation after extensive head and neck surgery _
that is, one-stage reconstruction by moving both skin and muscle to
use in the reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Conley's innovations came in the 1960s and early 1970s.
But as an Army surgeon in World War II, he pioneered methods of
reconstructing the cheek and the face.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, he founded the John Conley Foundation for
Ethics and Philosophy in Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Conley was the first president of the American Society of Head
and Neck Surgery and president of the American Academy of
Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology and of the American Academy of
Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Carnegie, Pa., he received his medical degree in 1937
from the University of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   His many professional writings include 13 medical textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   When Conley was 80, he stopped performing operations and retired
from his longstanding professional ties to Columbia University's
College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia-Presbyterian Medical
Center and St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center, all in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Monica; three children from an
earlier marriage, John of Honolulu, Mary Conley Downe of Manhattan
and Anna of Los Angeles, and three grandchildren.

 DR. DAVID PLATT RALL, CANCER AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. David Platt Rall, a cancer specialist and a leader in
environmental health research, died on Tuesday in Bordeaux, France.
He lived in Washington and was 73.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was injuries suffered in an automobile accident 10
days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   During almost 50 years as a researcher, Rall was principal or
sole author of about 180 scientific papers.
</P>
<P>
   For 19 years, before he retired in 1990, he led the National
Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, a division of the
National Institutes of Health, and was an assistant surgeon general
in the Public Health Service. From 1978 until 1990, he also led the
National Toxicology Program.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Rall was chairman of the Program on Chemical
Safety for the World Health Organization. He also served as foreign
secretary of the Institute of Medicine at the National Academy of
Sciences, was a board member of the Environmental Defense Fund and
a scientific counselor at the National Institute of Occupational
Safety and Health.
</P>
<P>
   He was especially interested in the problems posed by anticancer
drugs, which tend to be toxic in the doses needed to be effective.
That led Rall to predict toxic effects in human patients based on
studies of laboratory animals. He also explored the effects of
chemicals in the environment on the health of people in various
occupations and in the population as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   David Platt Rall was born on Aug. 3, 1926, in Aurora, Ill., and
was reared in nearby Naperville. He received a bachelor's degree at
North Central College in 1950, and a medical degree and a doctorate
in pharmacology at Northwestern University.
</P>
<P>
   He was an intern at Bellevue Hospital in New York City before
joining the National Cancer Institute in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Rall's first wife, Edith Levy Rall, died in 1987. He is survived
by his wife, Gloria Monteiro Rall; two children, Jonathan David, of
Irvine, Calif., and Catharyn Elspeth Ertel of Siegsdorf, Germany;
two grandchildren, and a brother, Dr. Edward, of Kensington, Md. &QL;

EDITORIAL: THE BATTLE OF BROOKLYN  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Oct. 2:
</P>
<P>
   The chaotic nature of the debate over the ``Sensation''
exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum of Art must not obscure the two
big issues involved. They have to do with the ground rules for
government financing of cultural institutions and the political
censorship of constitutionally guaranteed freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
   Reasonable people can disagree about spending tax money to
support the arts, but both Congress, by funding the National
Endowment for the Arts, and the city government, by funding a
variety of museums and programs, have made the political decision
to authorize such expenditures. We support that approach
wholeheartedly, believing support for the arts is essential to both
the intellectual climate and economy of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   We also believe, as a matter of law and constitutional
principle, that once the financial support has been granted, as it
has been for years, the institutions must be free to spend it
according to their own professional standards. Otherwise, citizens
will continually face situations like the current one in which
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has turned a gut reaction into a
destructive, punitive policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has addressed this foundation of principle in
a way that is not totally satisfactory, but that sheds an
interesting light on the current situation. The justices affirmed
the right of Congress to set ``advisory'' standards of decency for
programs receiving grants. But the high court warned against
pulling back or denying money already allocated because of the
content of the works being exhibited.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of New Yorkers seem to have a clear understanding of
this principle. To be sure, many citizens of conscience find parts
of the Brooklyn exhibition repugnant, and it is understandable that
many Roman Catholics would find Chris Ofili's image of the Virgin
Mary offensive. Others would agree with our colleague William
Safire that while the museum has a right to show what it likes, the
administrators of the Brooklyn Museum have been clumsy or
needlessly provocative. Yet a Daily News poll shows that the
majority of New Yorkers support the museum over Giuliani by a ratio
of two to one.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers show a broad-based support for New York's role as
the nation's cultural capital. The people understand intuitively
what Giuliani ignores for political gain. A museum is obliged to
challenge the public as well as to placate it, or else the museum
becomes a chamber of attractive ghosts, an institution completely
disconnected from art in our time.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, the battle will move to the courts. To support the
mayor's claim that the museum violated its lease, the city's
lawyers have concocted several theories. The city argues that the
museum broke its lease by conspiring with an auction house to
inflate the value of a private art collection at the expense of the
museum's public purpose. The city also argues that the museum
violated its public mission by deciding to charge a fee and to
exclude children under 17. We are confident the court will see the
city's arguments for what they are _ a pretext to justify the
mayor's anger at a museum that dared to defend artistic freedom. &QL;

1,000 GAMES AND COUNTING FOR USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Today's USC-Oregon State game marks the 1,000th
contest in the Trojans' history. Here's a look at some of the
important games that may have been largely forgotten in the first
50 years of this century:
</P>
<P>
   Stanford 16, USC 0; Nov. 4, 1905: This was not the first game in
school history, but it was the Trojans', uh, Methodists', first
against a major college. USC did not play another major college for
nine years after this loss. Football fell out of favor because of
its brutality, and many schools dropped the sport. USC dropped
football after 1910 and began playing rugby.
</P>
<P>
   USC 28, California 10; Oct. 23, 1915: This was the school's
first victory over a major college, although Cal was just beginning
to play football again after nine years of rugby.
</P>
<P>
   USC 14, Penn State 3; Jan. 1, 1923: This was the school's first
bowl game, and the start at the Rose Bowl was 45 minutes late
because Penn State was stuck in traffic. This was USC's first
victory with a national stature.
</P>
<P>
   USC was invited to play in the game because Cal turned down the
invitation several months before the contest.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska 17, Notre Dame 0; Nov. 26, 1925: Why is this game
included? USC had been hoping to find a marquee rival and sent
graduate manager Gwynn Wilson and his wife to Lincoln for this
Thanksgiving Day game.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame coach Knute Rockne was initially against the idea of
a series with USC, but Wilson's wife persuaded Rockne's wife that a
trip to Los Angeles every two years beat out snowy Lincoln, where
the fans were hostile to the Irish. Mrs. Rockne spoke to her
husband, and the rivalry was born.
</P>
<P>
   USC 27, Notre Dame 14; Dec. 1, 1928: This was USC's first
victory over the Irish, and followed two straight one-point losses.
This is the Notre Dame team that defeated Army in the famous ``Win
one for the Gipper'' speech.
</P>
<P>
   USC was led by quarterback Don Williams and running back Russ
Saunders, who was the model for Tommy Trojan.
</P>
<P>
   USC 74, California 0; Nov. 8, 1930: This stands as the worst
defeat in Cal history. USC also defeated Stanford 41-12, marking
the first time it had swept the Bay Area schools.
</P>
<P>
   USC 16, Notre Dame 14; Nov. 21, 1931: Johnny Baker kicked a
33-yard field goal with a minute remaining as the Trojans snapped
the Irish's 26-game winning streak, won their first game in South
Bend and eventually won the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   USC 38, Washington 7; Oct. 23, 1944: This was the first night
game for the Trojans in the Coliseum. Washington had travel
restrictions because of World War II, and was allowed to schedule
two games within seven days. Since the game had to be played on a
Monday, it became an evening contest.
</P>
<P>
   The game program said, ``This may well be the one and only
Coliseum night game in Trojan varsity football history.'' The crowd
of 62,865 was the largest of the season.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: WAITING FOR THE PRIZE MONEY AND GOOD NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DUDLEY CLENDINEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the middle of this decade, as mailboxes across the country
filled with junk mail of every kind, all competing for the personal
attention and dollars of the American family, the two biggest
sweepstakes mailers in the nation, Publishers Clearing House and
American Family Publishers, became more aggressive in the language
they used to make people think they were about to win something
big.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Eustace Hall,'' began a letter from Dorothy Addeo, the
contest manager at Publishers Clearing House, in Port Washington,
N.Y., to a 63-year-old day laborer in Brandon, Fla., who later
testified about it at a Senate hearing. ``I'm in a bit of hot water
and only you can help me out.'' Her boss had dropped into the
office to ask why Hall had not won a prize yet, Ms. Addeo wrote.
``It's not right when someone as nice as Eustace Hall doesn't
win,'' the boss supposedly said. Hall, who dreamed of sending his
daughter to law school, had bought many magazines from Publishers
Clearing House in hopes of winning a cash prize.
</P>
<P>
   Now, ``with a little help from you, I can personally guarantee
that you'll win a prize in our sweepstakes,'' Ms. Addeo wrote _ as
much as $5 million if he replied by a certain deadline. Signed
``Dorothy,'' the letter went out in October 1997 to 900,000 people,
each of whom was told that the boss had dropped in to inquire why
he or she had not won. The conversation with the boss, Publishers
Clearing House has admitted, was a fiction, one of about 100
mailings a year designed to stir up orders for magazines and other
goods. But that letter, along with millions of others sent out by
American Family Publishers over the signatures of the television
personalities Ed McMahon and Dick Clark, to retirees like
Margaretha Cryde, in Hallandale, Fla. (``YOU'VE JUST BEEN
POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED AS OUR $11,000,000 MYSTERY MILLIONAIRE FROM
FL!''), began to have unforeseen effects.
</P>
<P>
   In a Florida nursing home, eight old ladies sat in party hats
all day, waiting in vain for the Clearing House Prize Patrol to
arrive. In Baltimore, a poor young mother pulled her children out
of school, borrowed the plane fare and flew to Tampa, Fla., where
American Family's mail and distribution center is, to claim a prize
she had not won. Scores of others followed by bus and plane. In
Toledo, Ohio, an aggrieved psychologist wrote to Florida's attorney
general, Robert Butterworth, to say that her retired father had
spent almost $90,000 in seven years in response to direct mail.
</P>
<P>
   About 1 billion sweepstakes letters are sent each year. One was
addressed to ``Attorney General,'' in Butterworth's office. One
went to ``God,'' at a church in central Florida. But it is the
poor, the uneducated and particularly the old _ raised in a more
trusting time, and now often failing in eyesight or mind _ who seem
most easily deceived. Their humiliation _ and their families' rage
_ have prompted state suits against the sweepstakes publishers,
congressional hearings and tons of bad publicity for the
sweepstakes companies. The 30 percent of new subscriptions they
normally supply to the nation's magazine publishers are off by a
third.
</P>
<P>
   Because their letters are carefully written to stay inside the
law, sweepstakes companies usually prevail if sued. But now, losing
business and good will, they have become an industry receptive to
reform. American Family Publishers paid $4 million in May to settle
civil charges in four states, and reached agreement with 36 other
states and the District of Columbia on what new mailings can say.
Unimpressed, the Senate voted 93-0 in August to pass the Deceptive
Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act, championed principally by
Susan Collins, R-Maine. In Florida last month, Butterworth filed
suit against Publishers Clearing House for false and deceptive
practices.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill would require that sweepstakes letters make it
``clear and conspicuous'' that winning is not automatic, that the
odds of winning are very small, and that buying merchandise does
not improve them. It would also give the Postal Service nationwide
authority to stop deceptive mailings and to impose fines as large
as $2 million. The matter now goes to the Postal Service
subcommittee in the House, which is led by Rep. John McHugh,
R-N.Y., and it should move quickly to a vote, the full committee
and the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   The families of the old people hurt by sweepstakes companies
have done a service in complaining. They have given Congress and
attorneys general like Butterworth good reason to crack down on the
monster that direct mail has become. &QL;

USC SEEKS PRIME MOTIVATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Searching for a new way to motivate his team this
week, USC coach Paul Hackett sought the advice of Winston
Churchill. That might be all you need to know about how painful
last week's loss to Oregon turned out to be.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett didn't tell the Trojans anything about fighting Oregon
State on the beaches, in the fields or in the hills. Instead, he
chose an easy-to-understand Churchill quotation to post in the
locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Churchill said, `The only answer for defeat is victory,'''
Hackett said. ``And in football, you can't wait to get back out
there after a loss. There's a lot on the line for this game.
Mostly, it's about getting back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   USC gets its chance to atone for last week's bitter loss by
playing Oregon State today at 3:30 p.m. in the Coliseum. The
Beavers have not beaten USC since 1967 and have not won in Los
Angeles since 1960.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not your average Oregon State football team. The
Beavers are undefeated (3-0) and poised to have their first winning
season in 29 years.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in recent memory, USC will face an Oregon
State team capable of running and passing the football
proficiently. Tailback Ken Simonton leads the nation in rushing
(185.6 yards per game) while quarterback Jonathan Smith averages
277 yards passing. It's important to remember that Smith did not
even play in last year's 40-20 USC victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oregon State is a dangerous team for a couple reasons,''
Hackett said. ``One, they are rested and had a bye. Two, they have
a very potent offense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beavers are formidable, but it stands to reason that the
Trojans need to worry more about cleaning up their own act. USC
committed a school-record 21 penalties against Oregon, and by
week's end Hackett was weary over criticism of the Trojans'
sloppiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of questions about our lack of discipline,'' Hackett
said. ``We've just got guys doing stupid things.''
</P>
<P>
   So what is an acceptable level of mistakes? Hackett said
anything under 10 penalties would be OK. But USC has been under 10
penalties in just four of the 16 games Hackett has coached.
</P>
<P>
   One promise Hackett made was that playing time would be cut
because of the penalties. That means time for freshman cornerbacks
Darrell Rideaux and Kevin Arbet, who will relieve starters Kris
Richard and Antuan Simmons, who each had three penalties last week.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive line is also likely to have a minor shakeup, with
guard Faasea Mailo expected to start ahead of Donta Kendrick. The
reason for this change, however, is Kendrick's sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   There aren't many other options along the line because nearly
every player has been guilty of infractions and few of the reserves
are ready to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can just stop stubbing our toes and putting the offense
in bad situations, we'll be OK,'' offensive line coach Steve
Greatwood said. ``We're our own worst enemy in the running game.
Instead of first-and-10, it's first-and-15, or first-and-20. We've
got to keep ourselves in some second-and-6 situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Another change to improve the blocking has occurred at fullback.
Sophomore Charlie Landrigan, on the scout team three weeks ago,
will make his first start ahead of slumping Brennan Ochs. It's a
sign that anything is being done to eliminate mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett knows that with the Pacific-10 Conference full of
inconsistent teams, it won't take much to get back into the Rose
Bowl race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone can win three in a row and they are right in the same
position as Stanford is today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: A crowd of about 45,000 is expected for today's game....
Hackett said reserve quarterback John Fox would not necessarily see
action in today's game to get him used to the position again. Fox
has not played quarterback in a game since November of 1997.

NORTHRIDGE'S BACKUP QBS ARE WINGS IN WAITING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The odds are against Josh Fiske, David Lins and
Mitch Ryerson. And Brandon Martinovic, too. They might have a
better chance at winning $50 on a lotto scratcher than starting at
quarterback for the Cal State Northridge football team.
</P>
<P>
   But they practice every day with few complaints. They try to
help themselves, and the Matadors' receivers, get better. This
foursome knows Marcus Brady will start today's Big Sky Conference
game against Idaho State at North Campus Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Brady, a resilient sophomore who has made 14 consecutive starts,
probably has the job locked up for the next three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marcus has the easy job,'' CSUN quarterbacks coach Aaron
Flowers said. ``These (other) guys work their butts off in practice
and have little reward.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though they all play the sport's most glamorous position,
CSUN's four backup quarterbacks find themselves roaming from drill
to drill in practice, plugging in wherever they are needed.
</P>
<P>
   Fiske, a 6-foot-3, 205-pound senior who started three games for
CSUN in 1997 when then-starter Flowers was out with a broken foot,
will probably play on some kickoff and punt returns today. As
Brady's backup, Fiske also has to be the most prepared to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all good,'' said Fiske, who lost the starting job to
Brady before last season, ``but only one guy gets the shot.
Sometimes I think I'm working hard for nothing. That goes through
your mind, but you can't let that take away from what you're doing
on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   At least Fiske has had the chance to get into a few games. Lins,
a senior who was a standout at Crespi High and then Valley College,
hasn't taken a snap in two seasons at CSUN.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough, but obviously you never know what can happen,''
Lins said. ``You've just got to deal with it, I guess. It bothered
me a lot more last year.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ryerson transferred to CSUN from Iowa State two years ago,
he had a notion he was going to compete for the starting job. At
the time, Brady was a fourth-string redshirt freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ryerson, a junior, is fourth-string, behind Lins.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get down sometimes,'' he said. ``You just have to look
beyond that stuff. You have to remember why you are here. You're
working for a team. I'm also going to school, and that's important,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Education is what kept Fiske around. He considered quitting last
year and this past summer. But something kept him going.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been nights this past week when I don't feel like
playing anymore,'' he said. ``I talk with my dad, and I'm so close
to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Flowers is remembered now as holding CSUN's career
passing record, he was a fourth-string quarterback as a freshman at
Utah State six years ago. As the position's coach, Flowers has an
appreciation for guys like Fiske, Lins, Ryerson and Martinovic, a
freshman who may only get one chance to compete for the starting
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``They understand life,'' he said. ``You have to become a mature
person in the overall realm of life. These guys are helping Marcus
every chance they get.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiske said being a backup has ``become second nature.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can accept the role,'' he said, ``then do it. If not,
hang it up.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a striking departure from other presidential
candidates _ past and present _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
delivered a speech to the Christian Coalition on Friday that
mentioned abortion only in passing and did not touch on school
prayer, gay rights and other matters vital to religious
conservatives. Even so, he drew a rousing ovation and an unusually
warm outpouring from the coalition's founder, Pat Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's reception was a testament to the potency of his
presidential quest and underscored a new pragmatism among religious
conservatives. Many said they were comfortable with the governor
and, most important, believe he can win.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his advisers said he enjoys such a commanding lead in
the polls that he can behave more like a general election candidate
_ and avoid saying things that could haunt him if he wins the
nomination. That also explains why for the first time on Thursday
he surprised Republican leaders in the House by assailing their
spending proposals.
</P>
<P>
   But while Bush seemed to win over many at the Christian
Coalition, his strategy was not as successful on Capitol Hill:
Several House Republicans said they were angry, even felt betrayed,
by his criticism and that they had alerted the governor's aides of
their proposals in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Christian Coalition has waned in power in the past
year or so, it remains the nation's most powerful group of
religious conservatives. And its convention here attracted most of
the Republican presidential contenders.
</P>
<P>
   And while other candidates spoke more directly and passionately
about conservative issues, Bush was clearly favored by Robertson,
the group's president, who offered high praise for him and
dismissed the prospects of other Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm completely comfortable with him _ he is sound on the
issues and running a simply marvelous campaign,'' Robertson said in
an interview Friday. ``He's acting very presidential already. I
wouldn't say, `Well, come to the Christian Coalition and pander to
them _ and go to the labor unions and pander to them.'''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bush felt no need to tailor his message to the group.
Unlike his rivals, Bush essentially delivered his standard stump
speech to the 3,500 delegates. His only nod to the group was an
appended passage in which he mentioned having signed a bill
requiring that parents be notified whenever their unmarried, minor
daughters seek abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laws like this both respect families and protect life, and
these are some of the highest and most compassionate goals of
government.'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush opposes abortion and holds conservative views on many
issues, other candidates have questioned his commitment,
criticizing him particularly over his comment that there would be
``no litmus test'' for judicial nominees for their stands on
abortion and other matters.
</P>
<P>
   In their own addresses, other candidates put forth far more
direct and vigorous appeals, emphasizing abortion, homosexual
rights and prayer in schools.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole asserted that silent school prayer should be
permitted, and that the Ten Commandments should be displayed in
public schools. ``My commitment is to lean on the Lord with my
whole heart,'' she said, ``reading his word daily and earnestly
seeking his will in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, who is basing his campaign on backing from religious
conservatives, touched heavily on abortion, school prayer and
homosexuality. Unlike Bush, he said, he would make a judge's
opposition to abortion rights a prerequisite for appointment to any
federal bench. He added forcefully, ``My judges are going to
understand that marriage is between a man and a woman _ not two
men.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, reminded the group that he has
fought abortion for years. ``For 23 years,'' he declared, ``we have
fought together for the right to life.'' He vowed to be ``a
conservative president with guts.''
</P>
<P>
   The event at a hotel here came at a crucial time for religious
conservatives. Since former Vice President Dan Quayle dropped out
of the race this week and with Pat Buchanan expected to bolt the
party to seek the Reform Party nomination, Steve Forbes, Alan
Keyes, Mrs. Dole and Bauer are making particularly aggressive plays
for religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about other candidates who made more forceful appeals to
the coalition, Robertson offered a pragmatic analysis that they had
little chance of winning.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He was most critical of Bauer, saying, ``He's not going to win.
You don't win with 1 or 2 percent. And most people are not terribly
keen on a lost cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Told of the remark, Bauer replied, ``The voters decide who wins
_ not the heads of private organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said he admired Mrs. Dole, but explained: ``Elizabeth
is a very charming lady. She subscribed to virtually all of the
ideological points of the Christian Coalition. But I don't think
she will take first. Maybe she's playing for a role as vice
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson was even more critical of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
the only Republican contender who turned down an invitation to
speak. He said McCain's support of campaign finance reform would
make him a terrible president. ``It would absolutely gut
organizations like the Christian Coalition,'' he said. ``He will
not talk to our lawyers. He will not listen to reason. He is just
bullheaded on this.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the biggest threat to Bush is Forbes, because he is
organizing in pivotal states and pouring his own fortune into the
race.
</P>
<P>
   And while he was critical of Buchanan in his own speech for
Buchanan's comments on World War II _ and for threatening to bolt
the party for the Reform Party nomination _ Robertson defended Bush
for not mentioning Buchanan Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would seem self-serving if Bush goes after Buchanan,''
Robertson said. ``Then it would focus attention on Buchanan. And
that isn't necessarily a smart thing to do.'' Robertson said
Buchanan had canceled a scheduled appearance at the conference on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to Bush said they considered several options, ranging
from not appearing at the convention to speaking more directly
about social issues to making a splash by attacking Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, they arranged for a man who is popular with this
audience, Jay Sekulow, to introduce Bush. Sekulow, chief counsel
for the American Center for Law and Justice, a legal group, spoke
far more forcefully about Bush's conservative credentials than the
governor himself. ``Gov. Bush is obviously standing up for the life
of the unborn child,'' he told the crowd.

WITNESS COOPERATION IS CRUCIAL IN SOLVING CRIMES, AUTHORITIES SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TANYANIKA SAMUELS  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Police call him a hero.
</P>
<P>
   Clay County authorities might never have learned what happened
to 16-year-old James A. Weber had a young witness not volunteered
that a murder had been committed.
</P>
<P>
   He did the right thing, but with much apprehension, police say.
</P>
<P>
   He had good reason to be afraid.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents, Weber was killed because he
threatened to tell authorities about a planned armed robbery.
</P>
<P>
   The accused are behind bars, but the young witness may not be
out of harm's way. As a result, authorities will say little except
to praise his bravery.
</P>
<P>
   Police say it is increasingly difficult to get witnesses to come
forward, because many fear retribution.
</P>
<P>
   The fears are not unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   Sophia Szymczak was to testify against Michael Farris, 44, in a
burglary trial. On Sept. 3 the 76-year-old Kansas City woman was
strangled in her home. Now Farris faces first-degree murder
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``When situations like these happen,'' said Alvin Brooks,
president of the Ad Hoc Group Against Crime, ``it certainly has a
chilling effect on witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Burdened by fear
</P>
<P>
   Fear breeds silence. And that can impede investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to give us information,'' said Clay County
Prosecutor Don Norris, who is handling the Weber case. ``But
there's a very real fear of reprisal, not just from the individual
but also from some of that individual's friends and relatives.''
</P>
<P>
   It is happening in the case of Christy Schroeder, an 18-year-old
Northland woman who was murdered July 10. Authorities said she was
killed by William Brouse, who died in an Aug. 3 shootout with
police in Texas. But many questions remain unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get witnesses to talk so we can follow up on
other aspects of the case, but they're hesitant,'' County Sheriff
Bob Boydston said. ``We're seeing that they don't answer questions
directly, and the only thing we can attribute that to is that they
may still fear friends of Brouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses, he said, might have more to fear now than in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's young criminals are more apt to use violence during
the crime and to keep witnesses from going to authorities and
telling what they saw,'' Boydston said.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Whitley, spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in
Kansas City, said safety remained a serious and legitimate concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will always be some degree of risk,'' he said. ``But if
we ever decide, as a society, that we're going to let fear run that
process, then we have effectively turned over the power to the
criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Building trust
</P>
<P>
   Authorities also must battle distrust of the justice system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've found that people don't have a lot of confidence that the
system is going to work,'' Johnson County, Kan., Prosecutor Paul
Morrison said. ``They're thinking, `If it fails and this guy gets
out, he's coming after me.' &UR; ''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say a lot of work goes into establishing
relationships and building the confidence of witnesses. Sometimes
police must appeal to the witness' sense of duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had to tell people, `If you don't help us, this person
will walk,' &UR; '' Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Many law enforcement agencies offer temporary-relocation
programs and other protection for witnesses. Boydston said he
routinely informed potential witnesses of such programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Witness Protection Program since 1983 has provided
funding for moving expenses, food, and hotel stays, through the
state Department of Public Safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a witness is having a problem with threats and they let us
know, then we can help with relocation expenses or provide
additional security,'' Jackson County Prosecutor Bob Beaird said.
</P>
<P>
   County prosecutors can request the funding for witnesses and
victims alike, said Tami Holliday, spokeswoman for the Public
Safety Department. But with a budget of only $10,000, all
relocations are temporary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mostly to get them through the trial period and keep them
safe,'' Holliday said.
</P>
<P>
   The program helped six persons last year and two this year,
Holliday said.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas the Victims' Assistance Unit in Johnson County has
worked with crime victims since 1978, and more recently, with
witnesses. Counselors from the unit's Courts Awareness Program meet
one-on-one with witnesses to address fears and concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In federal cases the government also provides temporary
relocation. And in the most-extreme situations the FBI's Witness
Protection Program can provide a new identity for persons in
serious and ongoing danger.
</P>
<P>
   Anonymity helps
</P>
<P>
   One way to help solve crimes without witnesses having to
identify themselves is to use anonymous tip lines.
</P>
<P>
   The Greater Kansas City Crime Stoppers TIPS Hotline, sponsored
by the Kansas City Crime Commission, receives about 400 tips each
month, resulting in 50 to 70 arrests, said Sgt. Craig Sarver.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison said such tips were instrumental in solving the 1996
murders of two Shawnee, Kan., women. James R. Watson pleaded guilty
to killing April Sima, 16, and Rebecca Carlson, 21, and was
sentenced in February 1998 to life in prison with no chance of
parole for 80 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to do the right thing,'' said Norris, in Clay
County. ``And that's the greatest asset we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, authorities sometimes must go to extremes to gain witness
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, if a witness is uncooperative or is a flight risk,
police can obtain a court order, under the Material Witness Bond
Law, and hold the person until the scheduled court appearance.
</P>
<P>
   These instances are rare, but Morrison said he had used the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly don't want to make witnesses a victim,'' he said.
``But we have a job to do, and we're serious about getting it
done.''
</P>
<P>
   The consensus among authorities is that they cannot fight crime
alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact remains that were it not for information from
witnesses, the vast number of cases would never be made,'' said
Whitley, of the U.S. attorney's office. ``The public needs to
remember that law-enforcement agencies and prosecutors alone can't
make a case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to have witnesses.''

REASSURING PUBLIC IS IOC GOAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Utah)  (js) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The International Olympic Committee decided to let a foreign
anti-bribery treaty govern the actions of its members and cities
bidding for Olympic Games to reassure the public that there would
be no repetition of the recent Salt Lake City Olympic corruption
scandal, a committee spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's significant on a public relations scale,'' said Franklin
Servan-Schreiber, a spokesman for Juan Antonio Samaranch, the IOC
president. ``But we feel we're building enough firewalls inside the
organization that will be sufficiently deep to make sure the
problems don't happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday the Olympic committee asked to be placed under the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's
two-year-old convention on combating the bribery of foreign public
officials. Thirty-four nations have signed the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Under the treaty, any bribe directed at a committee member or
solicited by a member from a city that was bidding for the Olympics
would be prosecuted under anti-corruption legislation in 34
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The action by the OECD was recommended by an independent
commission that investigated the Salt Lake City scandal. Ten
Olympic committee members resigned or were expelled because of the
scandal, and the committee adopted new procedures to limit members'
visits to cities that are bidding for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Duberstein, vice chairman of the investigative commission,
said: ``We welcome this further affirmation that they are committed
to reform. We look forward to their action on all our
recommendations with the hope they will accept them.''
</P>
<P>
   Duberstein said Capitol Hill, which has threatened severe
legislative measures if the Olympic committee is not seriously
reformed, should welcome the committee's agreement to be governed
by the anti-bribery standard ``as an indicator that Samaranch is
committed to a systemic campaign of reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Servan-Schreiber said the Olympic committee would decide by
Monday whether Samaranch will testify Oct. 14 before a House
subcommittee investigating charges of vote buying during Atlanta's
successful bid for the 1996 Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic committee also said it might postpone executive
board meetings in Colorado Springs and Salt Lake City in February,
but denied that a decision would be based on FBI and congressional
investigations into Olympic bids. The committee noted a conflict
with a meeting Feb. 10-13 in Sydney, Australia, the site of next
summer's Olympics. &QL;

REGULATORS WOULD APPROVE A HYPOTHETICAL SPRINT-MCI MERGER, ESREY
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TED SICKINGER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Sprint Chairman William T. Esrey on Friday
would not confirm reported merger talks with MCI WorldCom, but _
speaking hypothetically _ he said such a deal could pass muster
with regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey addressed reporters after dedicating Sprint's partly
completed $920 million headquarters campus in Overland Park, Kan.,
a suburb of Kansas City. The ceremony was attended by dignitaries
who expressed a mixture of pride in the huge project and
apprehension about Sprint's future ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey said he had been fielding questions about possible deals
for a decade. Indeed, reports of the company's impending
acquisition have been standard fare in industry circles since
Sprint was formed by United Telecom and GTE in 1986. As long ago as
1987, The Wall Street Journal reported that Sprint was a prime
takeover target for MCI.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of MCI WorldCom, I think it's pretty clear that
merger could go through,'' Esrey said after the dedication. ``There
may be some Internet assets ... _ the extent of Internet backbone
that Sprint has and WorldCom has together _ that you would probably
have a divestiture there.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would not be a big deal in the whole scheme of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Esrey also stressed that if a merger were ever contemplated or
consummated, it would not be a doomsday scenario for about 15,000
Kansas City area employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to pose a hypothetical question, `What if MCI
WorldCom were going to buy Sprint?' I don't think it would make a
heck a lot of a difference around here,'' he said. ``If you look at
a pattern of the way they operate, I don't know anybody (who's)
ever moved to Mississippi.''
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom has two headquarters, one in Mississippi and one in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Sprint were going to be acquired by somebody, it's being
acquired because of the capabilities and the talents of the
employees,'' he said. ``Nobody in their right mind would acquire
Sprint and blow up what they're acquiring.''
</P>
<P>
   Esrey acknowledged, however, that recent reports about a
possible merger had been more persistent than those in the past and
were taking a toll on employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If rumors are true, I can't comment on them. And if rumors are
not true, I can't comment on them,'' Esrey said. ``That's the box
I'm in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's caused a lot of water-cooler comment. I've gotten a ton
of e-mail from our employees with questions and anxiety in some
cases.''
`Basic principle'
</P>
<P>
   Esrey said that the company had a ``tremendous commitment'' to
the Kansas City area and its employees and that those factors would
play an important part in any deal the company considered. But
management's primary consideration, he said, was to maximize
returns to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always (had) one basic principle, and that is, we're
in the business of creating value for our shareholders,'' he said.
``That's what management is supposed to do, over time, in the long
term.''
</P>
<P>
   A combination of Sprint and MCI WorldCom would form a powerful
force in the global telecommunications industry, with a formidable
presence in local-service and long-distance markets, a substantial
collection of international assets, the premier wireless company in
the country and a potentially dominant share of data and Internet
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Most investment analysts think that combination would be far
more rewarding for shareholders than a deal with an international
partner such as Deutsche Telekom, which has no presence in the
United States. And as long as regional Bell companies, such as
Southwestern Bell, are forbidden from offering long distance, an
MCI WorldCom deal is far more feasible in the short run.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey repeated his longstanding position on Sprint's ability to
go it alone in the industry, despite the increasing scale and
deeper pockets of competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said the same thing for 10 years,'' he said. ``Our
preference is to go it alone, but if anyone comes up and offers us
a price or creates a situation we think is better, we would act on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Sprint operates in parts of 19 states and would need to
seek approval from state, federal and European regulators, Esrey
estimated that it would take 12 to 18 months to complete any merger
into which the company entered.
--MORE--
</P>
<P>
   the company entered.
Backbone networks
</P>
<P>
   His comments about possible regulatory concerns in an MCI Sprint
deal match those of policy and industry analysts. Most observers
think the biggest hurdle would be potential concentration in the
top-level networks that provide long-haul connections throughout
the Internet, called backbone networks.
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom and Sprint are the two largest Internet backbone
providers, together providing more than 43 percent of Internet
service providers with their connection to the Internet, according
to a recent survey by Boardwatch Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   When WorldCom bought MCI last year, Sprint was one of many
parties that complained to regulators that the merger constituted
``a severe threat to the competitiveness'' of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   To expedite the merger, MCI agreed to sell its Internet business
to Cable &AMP; Wireless Inc. for $1.75 billion, along with the customer
contracts, employees, assets and services that would allow it to
replace MCI as a competitor in the market.
</P>
<P>
   Cable &AMP; Wireless is now suing MCI, alleging that it failed to
transfer all its customers, customer information and personnel, and
failed to provide all the services and support to operate the
business.
</P>
<P>
   MCI says it has filed a response to the allegations but declined
to provide any details.
</P>
<P>
   Any assets that the merged company would have to sell would be
eminently marketable.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Journal Constitution reported Friday that BellSouth
had approached investment bankers about the possibility of
purchasing a piece of Sprint, either its Internet network or its
local phone services business in the Carolinas and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sprint's Internet backbone might be for sale in the
event of a deal with MCI WorldCom, BellSouth could not buy it until
regulators lifted the ban on Bell companies providing long-distance
voice or data services in their own territory. It was unclear
whether a merged company would be interested in selling any local
telephone assets.
Merger mania
</P>
<P>
   A Sprint MCI merger also might face regulatory resistance based
on the resulting concentration in long-distance markets and in the
ownership of wireless cable spectrum across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint and MCI WorldCom collectively control more than 30
percent of the long-distance industry, and by some reports as much
as 37 percent. AT&AMP;T is said to have between 43 percent and 48
percent of long-distance markets.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the government's top telephone regulator sounded a
note of caution when asked about further consolidation in the
long-distance business.
</P>
<P>
   William Kennard, chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission, would not specifically address reports of a pending
MCI-Sprint merger. But he did credit competition in long-distance
markets for cutting rates for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today in America, consumers are enjoying the lowest
long-distance rates in history,'' Kennard said at a technology
conference. ``We cannot allow any merger to happen in this industry
that turns back the clock on that competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, after WorldCom's takeover of MCI, Kennard warned that
the industry might be testing the limits of megamergers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once this merger is consummated, the industry will again be
poised just a merger away from undue concentration,'' Kennard said
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint and MCI also have been acquiring wireless cable assets in
the last year, seeking a way to provide services to local customers
without leasing lines from the regional Bell companies. It was
unclear whether concentration in that market would give regulators
pause.
</P>
<P>
   Guests at Sprint's dedication ceremony Friday were circumspect
about the possibility that the company could be acquired.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the future holds, I don't know, but I'm counting on this
being a positive development in this state,'' said Kansas Gov. Bill
Graves. ``Until I hear something concrete, I'm operating under the
assumption that we're here to celebrate.''
</P>
<P>
   USA Today reported this week that MCI WorldCom and Sprint could
announce a deal as soon as Monday. That looks increasingly
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey said he planned to return to the office after the
celebration of the campus opening.
</P>
<P>
   And his plans for this weekend?
</P>
<P>
   ``If the weather cooperates, I plan to play golf or take a bike
ride,'' he said. ``I suspect I'll be in Kansas City on Monday.''

SENIOR CIRCUIT PLAYERS AGREE 
MEN'S TENNIS COULD USE HELP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CALVIN WATKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Jimmy Connors can't watch it. Bjorn Borg said
rivalries are needed. Mats Wilander said the game is doing fine.
</P>
<P>
   But on one thing all three former ATP Tour players agree _ men's
tennis isn't in the greatest shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad, but I think I found myself doing other things,''
said Connors, who will play today in the semifinals of the
PricewaterhouseCoopers Champions senior tennis tournament at the
Four Seasons Resort &AMP; Club at Las Colinas. ``I don't watch it, or
talk about it, and it's better that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Connors has won 133 singles titles over a 20-year career, which
makes his opinion generally well-respected.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he took some shots at the game's current No. 1
player, Andre Agassi, and in July, he ripped the tour in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something needs to be done because tennis had dropped below
lawn bowling in popularity,'' Connors told the ``Detroit Free
Press'' in July. ``In my day, what we did off the court was as
interesting as what we did on it. That was when tennis athletes
were more than just a name.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Mel Purcell, who was named the ATP Rookie of the Year in
1980: ``Jimmy gave it his all on the court. And Jimmy didn't have a
lot of talent. I think he sees Agassi with all this talent and
expects him to be No. 1 for the last 200 weeks. I really think he
feels Agassi fooled around with his talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilander, a winner of seven Grand Slam tournament titles, said
youngsters need to start playing the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this senior tour is going to help with the game,''
Wilander said. ``When the ball boys see us having so much fun out
there, they might want to pick up a racket and play this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Wilander also said the game itself is fine, more so
overseas than anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of play is in good shape,'' Wilander said. ``It's a
little bigger now overseas than it is here. I think people expect
Agassi and \RPete\S Sampras to be in the finals every time out, and
it's not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   At the U.S. Open last month, Sampras took himself out of the
tournament in the first week because of a bad back, and the
stiffest competition Agassi faced on the way to the title came from
Todd Martin. Agassi won the title match against Martin in five
sets.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, most of the buzz at the Opencame on the women's side.
The Williams family exchanged barbs with Martina Hingis, the WTA's
No.1 player, and Hingis ended up playing both Williams sisters in
the tournament. She beat Venus in the semifinals before losing to
Serena in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``See, that was great,'' Purcell said. ``You had all these great
women players in Hingis, and the Williams sisters and Steffi
\RGraf\S and Jennifer Capriati coming back to play; it was great.
The men's game was a real bore.''
</P>
<P>
   Borg, who won 11 Grand Slam tournament titles in his career,
said the current senior tour rivalries with him, Connors and John
McEnroe are needed on the ATP Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We enjoy these rivalries, even now,'' said Borg. ``What tennis
needs are rivalries like what we had in our day. Pete Sampras needs
Agassi and the rivalry that they had four years ago. That is what's
good for tennis.'' nn

 &HT;    Police prepare to arrest 4 in yogurt-shop slayings
 &HT;    By Leah Quin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ After hearing the news Friday, Dorothy Bradley
pinned a button to her butterfly sweater: In black and white, it
said, ``We Will Not Forget.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been waiting for this a long time,'' said Bradley, a
data-processing clerk at Lanier High School. She smiled at the
thought that one of Austin's most terrible crimes, the 1991 murder
of four teen-age girls at a frozen-yogurt shop, finally might be
solved. People familiar with the investigation said Thursday that
they are preparing to arrest four suspects, two of whom have
already confessed.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the city, Bradley never knew Amy Ayers, Eliza
Thomas or Jennifer and Sarah Harbison. She started at Lanier two
months before the murders, not enough time to meet Thomas and
Jennifer Harbison, both seniors or Sarah Harbison, a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   But like many in Austin in the early '90s, Bradley was wrenched
by the killings,which prompted a flood of grief and the staunch
slogan, ``We Will Not Forget.'' She wears the pin every year on the
anniversary of the girls' deaths: Dec. 6. On Friday, she wore it as
a badge of hope.
</P>
<P>
   It's a hope that Ayers' mother, Pam, didn't express Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we hear something from police, it's just another
story,'' Ayers said. ``There's been too many ups and downs with
this over the years. You learn to expect the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   For three families, the worst happened in 1991 at the I Can't
Believe It's Yogurt! store in a strip shopping center. Best friends
Eliza Thomas and Jennifer Harbison, both 17, worked there.
Harbison's sister, 15-year-old Sarah and her friend Ayers, 13, were
helping them clean up the store after it closed at 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:47 p.m., an Austin police officer on patrol reported a
fire at the store. In the back, firefighters found the girls'
bodies. Each had been shot twice in the back of the head. Three
bodies were burned beyond recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``For them to be taken out of this life with this kind of crime,
it was just horrendous,'' said Wayne Skrhak, assistant principal at
Lanier, where four crape myrtles and four oaks were planted as a
memorial by the school's FFA chapter, to which all four victims
belonged. ``It was pretty solemn around here for a while. Kids
would just start crying, adults were crying. Everybody was watching
the news, reading the paper. Everyone was on alert.''
</P>
<P>
   Lanier's seniors this year were in fifth grade when the murders
happened, and there was little discussion of the possible arrests
Friday, Skrhak said. However, he said, longtime teachers and
administrators had all heard the news by the time school began
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the year after the murders, dozens of suspects were cleared
and several confessions proved false.
</P>
<P>
   Two months after the murders, police arrested a woman suspected
of stealing tombstones, but later said she was not a suspect. Five
weeks later, police arrested a 17-year-old man but later released
him.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1992, Mexican authorities announced the arrest of
Porfirio Villa Saavedra and Alberto Jimenez Cortez and said one had
confessed to the yogurt-shop slayings. Two days later, Villa
Saavedra recanted his confession, saying he had been tortured by
Mexican police. He and Cortez are now in prison on unrelated
charges, but have never been officially charged in the Austin
murders.
</P>
<P>
   When police started a new look at the case in August, they had
more than 2,000 tips, a detective said Wednesday. An early suspect
who suddenly stopped talking drew police attention, leading to the
break. People close to the investigation said four men, two of whom
were juveniles at the time, are suspected.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the girls' parents founded We Will Not Forget SAJE,
named for the first initial of each child. The organization, funded
with a $12 million lawsuit settlement from I Can't Believe It's
Yogurt Ltd., its parent company and the owner of the strip shopping
center, promotes workplace safety for teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Ayers said she and Barbara Ayers, mother of the Harbison
sisters, have traveled all over Texas and in other states, talking
about the need for teen workers to remain alert in places where
cash is plentiful and security often lax. Though both have spoken
often in public about the deaths of their daughters, they plan to
hire another speaker soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emotions are still on a roller-coaster ride,'' Ayers said.
``I cry when I least expect it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Pam and Robert Ayers moved to a quarter-horse ranch in
Blanco, where Robert Ayers ranches full time. Pam Ayers works in
the cafeteria of a middle school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were too close to the yogurt shop,'' Pam Ayers said of
their former home in Northwest Austin. ``Too close to the sirens.
It got harder and harder to live there.''
</P>
<P>
   The yogurt shop never reopened after the murders. For a few
years, though the door was bricked over and the windows darkened,
the storefront became a shrine. Friends and strangers left notes,
flowers and burning candles on the window ledge.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, workmen ripped out a counter and started building a
partition, preparing the site for its new occupant, a catalog
company. A few yards from the entrance, an occasional news
photographer filmed the plaque embedded in the ground. Dedicated to
the victims and surrounded by a white picket fence, the plaque was
decorated during the day with a tissue-wrapped yellow rose and a
pot of tiny yellow buds.
</P>
<P>
   But tenants at the strip center said the crimes have never been
far from public consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once in a great while, I'll tell someone the address and
they'll say, 'Is that where those yogurt-shop murders happened?' ``
said one employee. ``People still come to look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Next door, Mary Caffrey said she was offered the space when she
opened Caffrey's sofa store a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to lease it. I didn't want to be where something
like that had happened,'' she said. ``It hasn't been forgotten.''

CULTURE OF YOUTH INVADES EVEN CURRENCY, SOME SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK MONTGOMERY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Look closely at your cash. Isn't Andrew
Jackson sexier than he used to be?
</P>
<P>
   Has Ulysses S. Grant been sneaking Grecian Formula and using
just a little anti-wrinkle cream?
</P>
<P>
   And Ben Franklin _ whoa! U.S. currency officials say Franklin's
enlarged image on the recently redesigned $100 bills was based on a
portrait done when he was nearly 80, about the same age as he was
on the old bills. Somewhere along the way he dropped 20 pounds and
regrew some hair.
</P>
<P>
   Next year the federal government's Currency Redesign Project
will unveil $10 and $5 bills with larger faces of Alexander
Hamilton and Abraham Lincoln. Watch out, GQ.
</P>
<P>
   Our forefathers seem to be fitter, less ancient and more
intriguing these days. The changes are not radical, but they are
enough to cause some to wonder. Ernest Lissabet, public affairs
manager for the Seniors Coalition advocacy group in Washington, was
only half-joking when he said, ``These portraits serve as yet more
evidence of the incredible obsession our society has for youth.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, says the engraver, Thomas Hipschen. Some engravings on
the old bills were based on miniatures and reproductions of
paintings, whereas Hipschen's were based on original sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``Franklin was a vibrant character, and I wanted him to look
vibrant,'' said Hipschen, who works for the Bureau of Engraving and
Printing.
</P>
<P>
   He already has finished Lincoln's new image, which was etched
from a different portrait than the one now on the $5 bill. The
engraver could not disclose any details before the bill's release.
</P>
<P>
   Face it: Nobody today has actually seen these leaders. Their
images were interpreted by painters who embellished, left out
blemishes or added shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Photography had arrived by the time of Lincoln and Grant.
Techniques were so primitive, however, that people had to pose like
mannequins to avoid blurring.
</P>
<P>
   ``An engraver, though he might be copying an image, is still an
artist in that he's making his own interpretations of the
subject,'' said Philip Meggs, a graphic-arts historian at Virginia
Commonwealth University.
</P>
<P>
   Besides that, Meggs said, ``the techniques used in engraving are
cleaner and more precise, the lines are finer. This results in a
crisper image and perhaps one that appears to be younger.''
</P>
<P>
   George Neighbors, a spokesman for the Gray Panthers, an advocacy
group concerned with ageism, does not buy that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think an enlarged portrait and sharper detail would show
more wrinkles, not fewer,'' he said after comparing old and new $20
bills.
</P>
<P>
   Some historians prefer the new engravings, but an article on the
Web site of the Council for Older Adults charged that the buffed-up
portraits reflected ``a classic example of federal mismanagement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In place of the dignified portrait of `Old Hickory' (Jackson),
we now see what appears to be a close-up of Henry Fonda on a bad
wig day,'' wrote columnists Stefan Kanfer and Michael Walsh.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was one of the most chronically ill presidents in U.S.
history, a sufferer of kidney disease and gunshot wounds, who
endured severe mood swings. The old image hinted at irritation as
he clutched the lapel of a cloak.
</P>
<P>
   Or so it seemed. In the original painting, according to
Hipschen, Jackson's knuckles were not visible below his neck; they
were added by the engraver of the old bill.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Moser, editor of Jackson's papers at the University of
Tennessee, said he likes the thoughtful expression on the new bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks more like a real person,'' Moser said, although ``I
do miss him clutching that cloak.''
</P>
<P>
   Franklin's images on both the old and the new $100 bills were
based on portraits done in the 1780s by painter Joseph Duplessis.
</P>
<P>
   The old $100, issued in 1929, re-created a 1784 Duplessis
portrait of Franklin _ jowly, thin-haired and beady-eyed. The new
image shades the flab on Franklin's neck, darkens his eyebrows,
thickens his hair and disposes of a heavy fur collar.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stood out more with the darker hair,'' said Hipschen, an
engraver for 31 years.
</P>
<P>
   Hipschen said he had heard good and bad comments. Some have told
him that the new Franklin resembles Jack Benny with locks, while
the new Jackson looks ``slick.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I did smooth out a few warts here and there, but I didn't want
(Jackson) to look slick,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hipschen's aim, he said, was to make the faces as real, bold and
enigmatic as their personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Since launching the Currency Redesign Project in the mid-1990s,
officials have stressed that the larger, off-center portraits and
all other design changes are needed to incorporate
anti-counterfeiting measures.

   ``We were not looking for aesthetic values per se,'' task force
director Thomas Ferguson said upon the release of new $50 bills
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Or, perhaps, they paid heed to what Franklin himself once wrote
of great people: ``All would live long, but none would be old.''

IN EDMONTON, A GREAT DAY CELEBRATING THE GREAT ONE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta _ Canada's favorite son came home to say
goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   The Edmonton Oilers raised Wayne Gretzky's No. 99 to the rafters
Friday evening, and no one in the National Hockey League will wear
it again. A sellout crowd stood throughout an emotional 45-minute
ceremony that included a video tribute, the raising of No. 99 to
the Skyreach Center rafters and a painting of the Great One.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever's an Oiler always calls Edmonton home,'' Gretzky said
before the season opener between the Rangers and Oilers, which
ended in a 1-1 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky, who played the last three seasons with the Rangers,
truly felt at home here for perhaps the first time since the former
Edmonton owner Peter Pocklington sold Gretzky to Los Angeles after
Gretzky's final Stanley Cup-winning team in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw the banner being raised, that's when I got
emotional; that's when I knew it was done,'' said Gretzky, who
began his career here as a 17-year-old and brought four Stanley
Cups to this city.
</P>
<P>
   Moments earlier, the Oilers' president, Glen Sather, had
delivered a moving speech in which he referred to Gretzky's
progression from boy to man to legend in Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm very proud to have been associated with all three of
them,'' said Sather, Gretzky's first NHL coach.
</P>
<P>
   Then three of his former teammates, Mark Messier, Jari Kurri and
Dave Semenko, helped Gretzky unveil a commemorative painting,
``Once an Oiler, Always an Oiler.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Gretzky delivered his own address.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could have played one more year,'' he said. ``It
wasn't meant to be. But I guess it's fitting they're parking me
behind that net.''
</P>
<P>
   With that Gretzky walked off the Oilers' ice before being
summoned back for one last curtain call.
</P>
<P>
   The city's anticipation had been mounting for this day since
April 18, when Gretzky played his final game for the Rangers at
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, local news stations interrupted programming
with special reports, cutting to Gretzky's private plane on the
tarmac at Edmonton's Municipal Airport. Gretzky entering a
limousine. Gretzky's route to a downtown restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The City Hall ceremony, in which the freeway by the old
Northlands Coliseum was renamed Wayne Gretzky Drive, was broadcast
live across Canada. Gretzky, who played his first 10 seasons for
the Oilers, sat on a dais between Sather and Mayor Bill Smith of
Edmonton. Gretzky's wife, Janet, their three children, his brother
and his parents were seated nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony had a homespun feeling to it. But it soon became
obvious that Gretzky has not lived in Edmonton in more than a
decade _ and that neither of his young sons had ever been here
before Friday. The high temperatures in Thousand Oaks, Calif.,
where the Gretzkys reside, have been around 108 degrees this week.
The temperature here hovered around freezing all afternoon, and
Gretzky's youngest son, Trevor, took refuge beneath a blanket as he
sat on his uncle's lap.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the ceremony, it began to snow. Gretzky, dressed
in a black turtleneck and a black leather coat, was shivering. More
than once, a black overcoat was thrown over his shoulders to help
him fight the chill.
</P>
<P>
   But it was also obvious that Gretzky was having a ball. Nine
schoolchildren had been selected to ask Gretzky a question each
during the ceremony. One second-grader asked the Great One if he
had not been a professional hockey player what would he have chosen
to do for a living?
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'd probably clean my highway,'' Gretzky said,
bringing on laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky arrived at Northlands Coliseum shortly before 4 p.m. and
walked straight for the visiting dressing room, where he met with
John Muckler, his coach from both his Edmonton and Rangers years,
and with his former Rangers teammates. Then, it was off to the
Oilers' dressing room, where Gretzky's former roommate, Kevin Lowe,
was preparing for his first game as a head coach. Lowe, who won
five Stanley Cups with Edmonton and one more with the Rangers, is
also credited with scoring the first goal in Oilers history,
although to this day, Gretzky playfully insists that it was he who
actually tipped the goal in. Lowe said he will always remember that
first goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it will be very easy for me to remember my first coaching
game, too,'' Lowe said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers and the Oilers are likely to remember this day for a
very long time, too. It was the Rangers' president, Neil Smith, who
petitioned the league to allow the Rangers to participate in Friday
night's game. And the Rangers will honor Gretzky with a sweater
retirement ceremony, perhaps Dec. 8, when the Oilers make their
only Garden visit.
</P>
<P>
   As for Gretzky, there is no chance he will ever forget Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the sweater goes up, it will be the official end to my
career,'' Gretzky said. ``The ceremonies in Ottawa and New York'' _
at the end of last season, when it became clear that Gretzky was
retiring _ ``were a celebration. This is going to be very
different. There will be a little bit of sadness. It is over and it
is an end. But I still wish I could play. And I still wish I was
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   That was after Sather had engaged in a little wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wayne's agreed to come back for one more year and play for the
Oilers,'' Sather joked. ``And he said no charge, which fits into
our budget.''
</P>
<P>
   And that _ and the resulting chants of ``One More Year!'' _
brought on the biggest cheers of the day at Edmonton's City Hall.

TAYLOR LOOKS TO BE IN CAMP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   According to exhaling sources within the organization, the
Clippers' neighborhood identity crisis will avoid a
public-relations pothole called ``No-Show Time.''
</P>
<P>
   This means a bad situation won't get any worse until later. It
also means that when the show goes on, Maurice Taylor is expected
to be in it.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, the pay-me-or-trade-me power forward, has been in touch
with other Clipper employees and plans to join his teammates when
the training camp fire is lit Tuesday at L.A. Southwest College.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds reasonable, but not when we rewind recent history:
</P>
<P>
   See, in our last peek at Donald Sterling's Clips, it was
business as unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, the team's best player and considered one of the NBA's
leading post-millennial hotshots, was volunteering to challenge
tradition and re-enlist for six more seasons. His enterprising new
agent, David ``Goliath'' Falk, posted the contract-extension price
tag as a league-maximum 70.9 million simoleons.
</P>
<P>
   But team owner Sterling, who holds a doctorate in sticker shock,
took a pass.
</P>
<P>
   So Falk, threatening to steer Taylor out of L.A. when Mo's
current three-year deal expires June 30, 2000, recommended a
pre-camp trade. When asked last week if Taylor would show up for
the grand opening of training camp, Falk said, ``I hope he's no
longer a Clipper by then.''
</P>
<P>
   But swapping Taylor for even meager value probably would require
Sterling to increase his current payroll, so that option is fading.
</P>
<P>
   Now Taylor, as the Clippers (with fingers crossed) expected,
will report for duty. According to a member of the Clipper staff,
Taylor insists he's ship shape, prepared to improve upon last
season's numbers (16 points, 5 rebounds per game) and prove he
deserves the monster loot.
</P>
<P>
   Falk, by the way, was in Springfield, Mass. for Friday's Hall of
Fame induction of pal John Thompson and could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of nowhere
</P>
<P>
   The team's hunt for a backup center also has been sabotaged by
Sterling's commitment to making a dollar holler.
</P>
<P>
   According to league sources, Elgin Baylor, the Clips' vice
president of basketball operations, was attempting to land Sean
Rooks from the Lakers. But on Planet Sterling, Rooks' reasonably
priced, multi-year deal was considered excessive. Rooks instead was
shipped to Dallas for A.C. Green.
</P>
<P>
   The latest backup-center candidate, 7-foot Croatian Zan Tabak,
seemed willing to play second fiddle to starter Michael Olowokandi,
but Sterling's frugal judgment wiped out that deal, too. Zabak has
signed with the Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Happy to be campers
</P>
<P>
   The non-roster roll call expected at L.A. Southwest includes a
Clipper encore from veteran point guard Scott Brooks (UC Irvine),
who missed last season after injuring his knee in an exhibition
game vs. the Lakers last February.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Jones, who led the nation in scoring for two seasons at
Long Island University, will be in camp after spending last season
with the Chicago Bulls. Other candidates are power forward Anthony
Avent, who used to work for the Orlando Magic, former Georgia
center Terrell Bell, small forward Rodney Elliott (a summer league
alumnus) and 6-11 Antonio Harvey, a former Laker and Clipper. But
with the Trail Blazers dealing six players to Houston for Scottie
Pippen, Harvey may end up in Portland.

(bl) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Friday told the Energy
Department and the Pentagon to review the safety of civilian
nuclear fuel processing. But experts inside and outside government
said that the Energy Department owns the plants that are most
vulnerable to an accident like the one in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Department officials also acknowledged that their ability
has declined to deal with a similar problem here, should uranium or
plutonium be accidentally assembled into a critical mass, starting
the chain reaction that would create a shower of radiation.
</P>
<P>
   A government panel of independent experts created to advise
Congress on the safety of the Energy Department's weapons
production said in a recommendation in May 1997 that at many Energy
Department plants ``the typical criticality safety staff consists
mainly of individuals who have no prior first-hand experience in
criticality.
</P>
<P>
   ``They lack background in neutron physics on a fundamental level
and are not familiar with work on assemblies near a critical state,
activities that would foster intuitive approaches to criticality
control,'' said the report, written by the Defense Nuclear
Facilities Safety Board. The report came just as the Energy
Department was considering closing its last laboratory for training
in criticality safety training to save money.
</P>
<P>
   The lab remained open, but board members are still concerned.
</P>
<P>
   The only commercial plant in the United States to ever
experience such a criticality reaction was in Charlestown, R.I. But
centers operated by the Energy Department and its predecessor
agency, the Atomic Energy Commission, suffered six such reactions
from 1958 to 1978, including three at the Idaho Chemical Processing
Plant, near Idaho Springs, Idaho, one at the Y-12 plant, near Oak
Ridge, Tenn., one at Hanford, near Richland, Wash., and one at Los
Alamos, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Five people died in those incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, there have been 21 ``inadvertent criticalities'' in
the United States, the Soviet Union and Britain, according to the
Energy Department. This is the term that nuclear engineers use for
accidental chain reactions. Twenty involved nuclear materials in
liquid solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a statement, said, ``We've been providing
information to Japan on our experiences in dealing with similar
incidents in the United States, and making available our experts in
atmospheric monitoring and any other areas that might be useful.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the seven commercial plants licensed by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission process uranium that is 3 percent to 5
percent U-235, the type that sustains a chain reaction. The
accident in Japan involved a mixture enriched to 19 percent U-235,
meaning a smaller volume would suffice for a chain reaction.
</P>
<P>
   One commercial plant, in Lynchburg, Va., owned by Framatome
Cogema Fuels, handles uranium that is more than 90 percent U-235,
for naval propulsion reactors.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, the solutions used in the United States are a
different chemistry from the mixture in Japan. A critical mass can
occur with any of a variety of different chemical mixtures. But in
the United States the commercial plants have an advantage because
they perform the same activities over and over, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Energy Department, Dr. David Michaels, the assistant
secretary of energy for environment, safety and health, said the
weapons program once had that benefit, when it was in steady
production. ``We recognize this overall vulnerability, going from
doing the same thing every day in the production operation, to
cleanup, which is a more dynamic activity,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Now the department is trying to clean out tanks that have been
sitting for months or years, with materials whose volume, content
or concentration must be carefully measured and calculated.
</P>
<P>
   Liquids are the most prone to flow into containers where they
will assume a shape and volume that can support a chain reaction,
as happened in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Herbert J.C. Kouts, a member of the board and former senior
scientist at Brookhaven National Laboratory, in Upton, N.Y., said
in a speech in August that two of the accidents, one at Los Alamos
National Laboratory and the other in Rhode Island, occurred in
cleanups of waste ``containing fissile material, an activity that
is now taking place at a number of the facilities for the
Department of Energy.''
</P>
<P>
   And while the public once accepted occasional nuclear mishaps,
Kouts said, ``in the most general way, a criticality accident is
now a complete no-no.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Kouts said, making the rules stricter to avoid criticality
problems is not itself the answer, because workers may happen to
break rules without causing an accident, and then ``develop a
contempt for the limits.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a special problem with ``orphan material,'' which is
nuclear material left over from experiments or projects from years
ago, said Robert Alvarez, a former senior advisor to the energy
secretary. Much of the department's clean-up work is driven by
agreements with state governments, he said, and if the orphan
material is not covered in such an agreement, it is often
neglected.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, ``criticality safety is rapidly atrophying
for lack of priority attention, because the front office doesn't
understand that this is one of the things that makes up the heart
and soul of nuclear safety.''
</P>
<P>
   But department officials said that they have intermittently shut
down plants for months at a time when they have found criticality
problems, and they recently discovered that they have ordered a
cumulative total of seven and a half years of shutdowns since 1994.
Partly for that reason, they organized the workshop at which Kouts
spoke in August.
</P>
<P>
   At the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which licenses the seven
commercial nuclear fuel processing plants, spokeswoman Sue Gagner
said, ``Right now, we have not instituted any changes.'' The NRC
inspects each plant twice yearly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We require that they have at least two safety measures to
prevent criticality,'' she said. These could include such
precautions as regulating the size or shape of containers to
configurations that could not support criticality.

POPPING THE `BUBBLE NIGHTMARE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're looking for a reassuring perspective, it's Merrill
Lynch to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   During a week when the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was dipping
below a ``correction'' level and The Economist featured a ``bubble
nightmare'' cover story, Merrill Lynch's Global Securities Research
&AMP; Economic Group issued a special report titled, ``The U.S. Economy
Is No Bubble.''
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics may say big investment firms have a vested interest in
playing the cheerleader role even when optimism isn't merited, but
the viewpoints of Merrill Lynch's economists are as valid as those
playing Cassandra. Perhaps even more so.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't as though the upbeat analysis was Panglossian. It
acknowledged that there would be ``bumps along the road ahead,''
but said this was no reason to be unduly pessimistic. The economy
is in ``excellent fundamental shape,'' the report said, and the
stock market is not overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   The Economist, on the other hand, sees danger everywhere and
urges Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan to use his influence
to engineer another interest rate boost when Fed monetary
policy-makers convene Tuesday. The main concerns are soaring trade
deficits, and explosive levels of consumer buying and borrowing.
The Economist also challenges the assumption that fundamentals
justify the stock market's historically lofty levels.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch, however, quarrels with such arguments and uses
convincing data to buttress its position. Excluding the technology
sector, its analysts note, S&AMP;P 500 companies are selling at 21
times this year's estimated operating earnings per share, which is
``in line with past experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the broader economy, it also takes issue with claims
that consumers are overextended and that America suffers from a
negative savings rate. This point of contention is key, because
personal consumption fuels about two-thirds of all U.S. growth. If
the consumer falters, so does the economy.
</P>
<P>
   While official figures show the savings rate plunging from 5
percent to a point where Americans spend more than their income,
this is due to faulty methodology when treating capital gains, the
report maintains. When the accounting adjusts for this conceptual
flaw, the savings rate is really 8 percent, not negative, ``and has
been stable for the past decade.'' Moreover, even if the stock
market declined substantially, household net worth levels would
still be at historically high levels. Consumption could be expected
to fall, the report says, but the falloff wouldn't be big enough to
be disastrous to the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, contrary to conventional wisdom, consumer borrowing
has been weaker than during any prior expansion cycle. Consumer
defaults not only are at a three-year low, but credit card debt is
being paid down at ``the fastest pace on record,'' Merrill Lynch
says.
</P>
<P>
   The key to current growth, according to the report, isn't an
asset bubble, but rather an ``acceleration of an underlying
productivity trend.'' Productivity growth since the mid-1990s, it
says, has been double the pace of the previous 25 years and is
still accelerating.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Merrill Lynch's economics team says, ``the doomsayers'
arguments look deeply flawed.''

BLOOD QUEST BEGINS IN NEW YORK FOR VIRUS RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By VIVIAN S. TOY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ City and federal health officials started going
door-to-door in northern Queens Friday seeking donors of blood
samples for a study to determine the overall infection rate of the
mosquito-borne West Nile virus.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they would continue to slip information in
mailboxes and underneath doors through the weekend and would
probably not begin visiting homes to actually draw blood from
volunteers until the beginning of next week.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials had expressed concern earlier in the week that
the city had not yet adequately informed residents about the study.
They urged the city to distribute information before sending teams
of health officials into the neighborhoods to interview residents
and take blood samples.
</P>
<P>
   Laboratory tests by the  &UR; f &LR; ederal Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention have confirmed 35 cases of the virus in New York
City, including four deaths. Officials plan to draw blood samples
from 300 volunteers over the next three weeks in the quest to
better understand the scope of the outbreak of West Nile, the first
in the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   The response from residents throughout the affected area, which
includes parts of the Whitestone, Auburndale, Linden Hill, Murray
Hill and College Point neighborhoods, ranged from apprehension
about strangers wielding needles to eagerness to do their civic
duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to find how to fight this,'' said Werner Dietrich of
Beechhurst. ``And I don't mind if they take the test in a proper
manner, but not if they come to my house with a needle.''
</P>
<P>
   Dietrich, 61, was even more put off when he learned that
officials would not be taking the names of volunteers and that the
donors would not receive the results of their individual blood
tests. ``Why should I volunteer for a test if I'm not even going to
know how the test came out?'' Dietrich asked.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Cheffo, who lives near Little Neck Bay, said she would
like to know how the West Nile virus found its way to Queens, but
also said she probably would not participate in the study if asked.
``I'm not a fan of the needle, especially on a volunteer basis,''
said Ms. Cheffo, 34. ``And why would you participate and agree to
get poked if you're not going to find out the results?''
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Mullin, a spokeswoman for the city's Health Department,
said officials had anticipated that some people would decline to
participate because results of the tests would not be provided. But
she said that the study was being conducted in the same way that
the Centers for Disease Control always carried out such studies.
</P>
<P>
   She added that the people who are to be tested would very likely
be healthy. The health workers hope to identify people who might
have been infected with the virus but who show no symptoms of the
illness or only very mild symptoms. While West Nile virus leaves a
person's blood very soon after infection, antibodies can remain for
months, or even years.
</P>
<P>
   A positive result on a test does not necessarily mean that the
person was ever sick or will become sick, Ms. Mullin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, there is no specific treatment for the virus, and the
only assistance we could give people is supportive therapy,'' she
said. ``So it's not as if we could administer something to make
them feel better even if they were to become sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mullin said that starting next week, teams consisting of a
doctor, a nurse and a public health worker would interview
residents in the designated neighborhoods and ask for voluntary
blood samples. Residents will be able to choose between having
their blood drawn at home or at one of the Health Department vans
that will be stationed in the area. Ms. Mullin said six to eight
teams would visit homes in the evenings during the week and during
daylight hours on weekends.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some residents said they would volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty healthy, so I'm not worried if I have the virus or
not,'' said Enis Mormile, 79, of College Point. ``Sure, I'd be
bothered by the test, but everybody's got to chip in and do their
part.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter O'Donnell, 61, of Whitestone, was almost blase about the
testing.

southern Westchester County.

Hollow, Ossining, Mount Kisco, Chappaqua, Bedford, Rye Brook, White
