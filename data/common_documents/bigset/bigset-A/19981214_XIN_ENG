JERUSALEM -- The Wye peace accord is a good one and both Israel
and Palestine must fulfill their commitments to implement it, said
U.S. President Bill Clinton here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference after his talks with Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Clinton said some progress has
been made so far in implementing the Wye agreement, but the peace
process needs both sides to do more.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side has began its troops withdrawal from the West
Bank, reached an agreement on opening the Gaza airport with the
Palestinians and started the difficult process of releasing
Palestinian prisoners. These were the progress made by the Israeli
side, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNC) has also taken some
important steps within their commitments to implement the
agreement, such as deepening its security cooperation with Israel,
starting confiscation of illegal weapons, dealing with incitement
and taking concrete steps to ratify the PLO charter, he said.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Speaker Vows to Support Palestinian Struggle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran's conservative Majlis
(parliament) Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri on Sunday vowed to
support the Palestinians to fight against Israel until the
"annihilation of the Zionist (Israeli) regime."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Majlis open session, Nouri said the ongoing visit
of the U.S. President Bill Clinton to Israel and the Palestine
self-rule area "cannot not change the mission and the armed jihad
(holy war) of the Palestinian people."
</P>
<P>
The United States leadership should realize that Jerusalem is
the permanent capital of the Palestinian state and the Palestinian
people will continue their resistance, according to Nouri.
</P>
<P>
He condemned the removal of anti-Israeli clauses from the
Palestinian national charter by leaders of the Palestinian
National Council (PNC), terming the move "an ill-omened and
dangerous plot."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the PNC chaired by Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, Nouri said the "small group led by a mercenary, capricious
and unstable agent will certainly fail before the will of the
Palestinian people."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian charter is the price of half a century of war
and resistance by the Palestinian people who "certainly will not
give it up so easily," he added.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Eradication, World's Central Task: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 13 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela said Sunday that poverty eradication and underdevelopment
are the challenge facing the world at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of
the World Council of Churches here in the Zimbabwean capital.
</P>
<P>
"The rights that have been gained, and that have been declared
universal, will remain hollow shells and our freedom incomplete
if they do not bring an end to the curse of hunger, disease,
ignorance and homelessness which blight the lives of millions, in
our country, in Africa and across the globe," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Mandela, the gap between the rich and the poor in
parts of the world is widening rather than narrowing. He called
for the creation of a new world order.
</P>
<P>
"The reshaping of the institutions of the existing order has
become a matter of urgency if peace and a life of dignity are to
become a reality for all," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela urged all countries in the world to work together to
ensure that the legacy of underdevelopment does not leave Africa
on the margins of the world economy.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to find ways to increase the inward flow of
investment, to widen market access, and to remove the burden of
external debt which affects Africa more than any other region.
</P>
<P>
On issues concerning Africa, he said the conflicts in the
Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, the Sudan and elsewhere are
a great concern.
</P>
<P>
"At the end of a century that has taught that peace is the
greatest weapon in development, we cannot afford to spare any
effort to bring about a peaceful resolution to such conflicts,"
said the president.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Mandela had a 30-minute courtesy meeting
with host President Robert Mugabe, Mandela's spokeswoman said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Officials Contact Arafat on Charter Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. officials contacted
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Sunday to try to find out
what the Palestinian National Council (PNC) could do on ratifying
the PLO charter, according to a senior Palestinian official.
</P>
<P>
Arafat did not give the U.S. side a clear answer to this
question, but promised that the charter ratification process will
be satisfactory to President Bill Clinton when he visits Gaza on
Monday, the official said.
</P>
<P>
During his one-day visit in Gaza, the first of its kind for a
sitting U.S. president, Clinton will attend and address the PNC
meeting which will reaffirm the nullification of the clauses of
the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) charter calling for
Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
As stipulated in the Israeli-Palestinian Wye peace accord
signed in October in Washington, the PNC has only to reaffirm a
letter sent in January this year by Arafat to Clinton, in which
Arafat outlined the anti-Israel clauses that the PLO has deleted
from its charter.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted that
the PNC vote on this issue, otherwise, there will be no further
Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Such a position of Israel has caused some trouble for Clinton
because asking the PNC to vote on this issue also runs against the
Wye peace accord.
</P>
<P>
In Gaza, Palestinian preparations for Clinton's visit have
been completed, said the official, adding that Arafat expressed
his hope that Clinton's current visit to the region will help
implement the Wye accord.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian and U.S. flags are flying on both sides of the Gaza
streets and the Arafat International Airport as well as the Shawah
Cultural Center where the PNC will hold its meeting on Monday, the
official added.
</P>
<P>
As asked by Arafat, 70 Palestinian hunger strikers requesting
Israel to release Palestinian prisoners in Gaza ended their
strike Sunday to make room for Clinton's visit, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Shaath, Minister of Planning and International
Cooperation of the Palestinian National Authority, said in Gaza
Sunday that Clintons' visit to Gaza is a historical event for the
Palestinians and the visit will help push the peace process
ahead.

<HEADLINE> President: No Solution to the Cyprus Issue Reached </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides said here Sunday that no solution to the Cyprus issue has
been worked out yet.
</P>
<P>
Upon returning from the two-day Vienna summit of the European
Union, which Cyprus is bidding for membership, Clerides said that
if any proposal regarding the Cyprus issue should emerge, it would
be before the U.N. Security Council session at the end of this
month.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed press speculations that the United Nations and the
United States were trying to avert the proposed deployment of
Russian S-300 missiles on the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus signed a deal with Russia in January 1997 to buy S-300
anti-aircraft missiles but postponed the arrival of the missiles
until the end of December amid Turkey's threat to launch
preemptive strike on the missiles if they are deployed.
</P>
<P>
Clerides did not rule out possible intervention from the
U.S. or the U.N. resident representative Ann Hercus, whom he will
meet on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hercus' shuttle talks between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
sides, initiated in mid-October, are aimed at finding "common
ground" between the two sides, the president said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that U.S. Cyprus Coordinator Thomas Miller, who
visited the island on Friday, has not been in touch with him.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said Greek Premier Costas Simitis briefed him on the
E.U. enlargement discussions on the Vienna summit.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
in 1974 following a failed pro-Athens coup.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Keep its Major Policies Unchanged: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 13 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's policies
would essentially remain the same after 1999 general elections,
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with reporters in Cape Town, Mbeki said there
would be no strange policies being cooked in secret, noting that
the African National Congress' policies were based on South
Africa's realities, which would remain the same.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there is a need for a radical review of policy.
We might have to do certain things to speed up implementation,"
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said the absolute numbers of civil servants needed to be
reduced, but the civil service's effectiveness needed to be
increased through training, stressing that the emphasis had to be
on quality rather than quantity.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed the government's economic strategy and
direction was correct but certain things needed to be speeded up.
</P>
<P>
"We need to move vigorously toward encouraging the small and
medium-sized business sectors, which provide jobs."
</P>
<P>
Speaking of crime, Mbeki said one of the biggest challenges
was rebuilding the capacity of the criminal justice system's
structures.
</P>
<P>
The leadership and skills of the police service had to be
increased and corruption in its ranks combated.
</P>
<P>
Private citizens themselves should also become the service's
"eyes and ears" in helping fight crime, he said.
</P>
<P>
On corruption, Mbeki said it should be fought vigorously but
it should be noted that corruption was not just to be found in
the government sector, but also in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Large numbers of people were, for instance, evading their tax
responsibility, which amounted to "theft of government funds by
private companies", he said.

JOHANNESBURG, December 13 (Xinhua) -- South African traffic
officers around the country will crack down on speeding and
drunken drivers over the holiday season, Transport Minister Mac
Maharaj warned Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a media briefing, Maharaj said traffic police

criminal records," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Officers will also be equipped with up-to-date radar and laser
devices to monitor vehicles speeds, he said.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,171 people were reportedly killed in traffic
accidents in South Africa between December and January last

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Israel to Live in Peace With Neighbors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Israel must live side by
side with its neighbors and only in this way the region can have a
real peace, said U.S. President Bill Clinton here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a big Israeli youth gathering at Jerusalem
convention Center attended by thousands of Israeli high school
students and army soldiers coming from different parts of the
country, Clinton said that every young Israeli should have a
vision for the future, that is to live in peace with others.
</P>
<P>
Fifty years has passed since Israelis established their own
country on this holy land, and millions of Jews lost their lives
for this, Clinton said, adding that the lessons gathered in the
past showed that if Israelis want to live in peace, they should
have to form partership with all its neighbors and live side by
side with them.
</P>
<P>
Foreign diplomats here pointed out that those remarks made by
Clinton were apparently aimed at urging those Israeli hardline
politicians and groups to change their attitude towards peace and
to support the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Peace is not only critical for the Israelis, but also for the
Palestinians, he said, adding that for realizing a real and
lasting peace in this region, Israelis must make joint efforts
with others, particularly the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israel should grasp every opportunity to realize peace with
others, otherwise, there will be more bloodshed and the Wye peace
accord signed in Washington in October can benefit Israel in
achieving peace, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged both Israelis and the Palestinians to speed up the
peace process and negotiate a final settlement of the problems
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian people also suffered a lot in the past and they
also have the right to live in peace, so the United States and
Israel should provide more economic assistance to them in order to
move the peace process forward, he said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also addressed the
gathering, insisting the Palestinians live up to their commitments
in implementing the Wye peace accord.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> FM: Russia Concerned Over New NATO Doctrine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said Sunday that Moscow was bothered by some points in
NATO's new strategic development concept.
</P>
<P>
"Judging by early estimates, there is a whole number of points
that bother us," Ivanov told the TV-6 "Observer" program, noting a
possible use of NATO force bypassing the U.N. Security Council and
possible NATO actions beyond its sphere of responsibility.
</P>
<P>
He warned that acceptance of these provisions might lead to
undermining the entire system of international relations based on
universal law and U.N. supremacy.
</P>
<P>
However, Ivanov, who's last week met with NATO counterparts in
Brussels, expressed the confidence that cooperation with NATO
undoubtedly benefits Russia.
</P>
<P>
"If we create a reliable European security system, we will be
able to spend more on our security and on solution of many social
and economic problems rather than on arms," he said.

<HEADLINE> France Ready to Support Egypt's Development: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 13 (Xinhua) -- A visiting French official
Sunday expressed his country's readiness to support Egypt's
development programs, the Egyptian Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, French
Minister of State for Foreign Trade Jacques Dondoux told reporters
that France is ready to finance Egypt's infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to attract foreign investments, Egypt has planned
to open infrastructure projects to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Dondoux voiced satisfaction with the growing ties among the
medium and small enterprises of the two countries. He proposed
that Egyptian medium and small companies set up joint ventures
with French firms to market their products in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate the step, France will organize a fair in Egypt
next May for its products, he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides the bilateral economic ties, Mubarak and Dondoux also
touched on the Egypt-EU relations, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak expressed dissatisfaction with EU's anti-dumping
measures against Egypt, Dondoux said, adding that this problem no
longer exists between Egypt and France.
</P>
<P>
Some EU members, including France, proposed early this year to
adopt the measures against Egypt's goods, including textiles and
cotton. The two sides have resolved the issue through talks.
</P>
<P>
The French official arrived here Saturday night for a three-day
visit.
</P>
<P>
He signed Sunday with Egyptian Minister of State for Planning
and International Cooperation Zafer el-Beshri a financial protocol
for 1999, under which France is to provide Egypt with a loan of
260 million French francs (47 million U.S. dollars) for
development projects.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Tajik President Emomali
Rakhmonov arrived here Sunday evening for a three-day official
visit on bilateral economic and cultural cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival, Rakhmonov said he would also discuss key regional
issues with Iranian officials, the Islamic Republic News Agency
(IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
He thanked Iran for its effective role in the restoration of
peace in Tajikistan and said Iran can play an important role in
the maintenance of peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
He called on Iran's private sector to invest in Tajikistan and
said the Tajik government is ready to cooperate with Iran in all
fields.
</P>
<P>
Greeting Rakhmonov, Iranian President Mohammad Khatami said the
two countries should take advantage of the commonalities between
them to expand their relations.
</P>
<P>
Khatami voiced Iran's readiness for cooperation with
Tajikistan, saying it will benefit both countries.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Afghan issue, Khatami called for the
establishment of a broad-based government in the war-torn country,

<HEADLINE> British Animal Rights Activist Ends Hunger Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 13 (Xinhua) - A British animal rights activist
who has been on hunger strike for 68 days in protest at
experiments on animals gave up his fast on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But it was not immediately clear why Barry Horne, 46, who is
serving an 18-year prison sentence for firebombings, ended the
fast, which was meant to force the government into setting up an
inquiry into animal experiments.
</P>
<P>
His supporters said they would issue a statement later on
Sunday which contained "positive" developments, according to a
Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
Horne, who had staged two previous hunger strikes, almost
become Britain's first "martyr" to the cause of animal rights in a
nation which is considered often to care more about dogs and
horses than children. But his campaign suffered a setback this
week when he was moved back to prison from hospital after refusing
medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
Animal rights activists had claimed for more than a week that
he was on the verge of slipping into a coma, had already gone
blind and had suffered irreparable liver damage.
</P>
<P>
Horne's supporters acknowledged that he had been taking orange
juice and sugared tea on several occasions during the hunger
strike.
</P>
<P>
The Animal Rights Militia, armed wing of the shadowy Animal
Liberation Front (ALF), had vowed to assassinate 10 people it
accuses of cruelty to animals, mainly leading medical researchers,
if Horne died.
</P>
<P>
Horne is a member of the ALF, which has claimed responsibility
for dozens of guerilla-style attacks over the years in its
campaign against cruelty to animals.
</P>
<P>
British officials said last week that there were no immediate
plans to set up a commission of inquiry into medical research on
animals and said the government would not give in to blackmail,
Reuters said.

<HEADLINE> OAU Ministerial Meeting on Refugees Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar
Bashir on Sunday called upon the international community to help
African countries in shouldering the burden of refugees.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal while addressing the opening session of the
ministerial meeting of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) on
refugees, returnees and displaced people in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The president appealed for the protection of refugees from
wars, particularly children who were being recruited in military
operations against their will.
</P>
<P>
He said that his country would give shelter to refugees and
support them despite its economic constraints, and asked the
participating countries to work out specific recommendations that
would lead to solutions to the refugee problem.
</P>
<P>
There are about 8 million refugees and displaced people in
Africa, out of a total of 20 million the world over. The Sudan
alone gave shelter to some 1.1 million refugees, most of whom from
neighboring Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Bashir further stated that the African continent has been
suffering ever since the 60s from waves of refugees, an issue that
merits concerted international efforts.
</P>
<P>
He also condemned terrorism in all its forms, and denied that
his country had been implicated in any terrorist activity. He
expressed his country's readiness to cooperate with the
international community in combating terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He called upon African nations to join hands in confronting its
problems and doing away with the causes that prompt refugees to
seek asylum.
</P>
<P>
He added that his government has laid the foundations of
justice and equality among all citizens without discrimination,
ethnic or religious, with the hope of establishing a just peace in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The Sudan has been suffering from a civil war in the south ever
since 1983, which led to the displacement of some 3 million people
who moved to the northern areas, and the flee of over 140,000
others to neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Also addressing the inaugural meeting, OAU Secretary General
Salem Ahmed Salem said that Africa should endeavour to defuse the
causes of conflict in each of the Congo, Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda,
Angola, Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
An end to the armed conflicts and problems in these countries,
would contribute to the stability in the African continent, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by ministers and representatives of 42
African states.

<HEADLINE> Arms Inspectors Finish Surprise Visits to Iraqi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 13 (Xinhua) -- U.N. arms inspectors finished
their surprise visits to suspected Iraqi sites on Sunday according
to schedule, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Hussam Mohammed Ameen, head of the Iraqi liaison with the
U.N. arms inspectors, said that 10 inspection teams of the United
Nation Special Commission (UNSCOM) and the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) inspected 25 sites, seven of which not under
long-term monitoring.
</P>
<P>
Ameen said an UNSCOM team headed by Australian Roger Hill
broke off its mission that should be carried out on Sunday and
left for Bahrain without explaining the reason for breaking off
its activities.
</P>
<P>
An IAEA team also left Iraq on Sunday after finishing its
surprise visits to Iraqi sites, he said.
</P>
<P>
Arms inspectors started surprise visits to Iraqi sites earlier
this week but found no banned weapons or activities so far.
</P>
<P>
United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright affirmed on
Sunday that some surprise inspections to Iraqi sites were carried
out.
</P>
<P>
"We know it (Iraq) has not turned over some of the documents
and some of the inspections were blocked. We also know some of
them went forward," said Albright in Jerusalem in an interview
with the U.S.-based Cable News Network (CNN).
</P>
<P>
She added that "it is a mixed record, we are looking at it
over. Options are on the table in terms of the comprehensive
review and how we go about it."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council should begin its comprehensive
review of Iraq's compliance with relevant U.N. resolutions if
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan reports to the council that
Iraq has fully cooperated with U.N. arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM spokeswoman in Baghdad Caroline Cross told reporters on
Saturday that UNSCOM Chairman Richard Butler would submit a
report to Annan next Tuesday on whether Iraq had kept its promise
of full cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
In late November, Butler alleged that Iraq had not handed over
all the documents concerning its weapons programs to UNSCOM, an
accusation denied by Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM alleged that during the past week, Iraq blocked
inspections twice, saying they were prevented from entering one
of the ruling Baath Party's regional headquarters and one base
that belongs to Iranian opposition force.
</P>
<P>
Iraq denied the allegation, saying the inspection of Baath
Party's regional headquarters was aimed at provocation.
</P>
<P>
In mid-November, Iraq announced unconditional resumption of
full cooperation with U.N. arms inspections it suspended three
months ago, narrowly escaping a U.S.-led air strikes.

<HEADLINE> DRC President Calls for Withdrawal of Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting President of the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) Laurant Kabila Sunday called on
foreign countries to pull back troops from DRC in a bid to realize
regional peace.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, who arrived here Saturday for a three-day visit, made
the call during a meeting with a number of African ambassadors on
the latest developments in DRC in Cairo, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, DRC Agricultural Minister Mawampanga Mwana
Nanga said that Kabila stressed that his country seeks peace,
which the DRC president said can never take place unless all the
foreign powers withdraw their troops.
</P>
<P>
Kabila urged the "aggressive countries" to pull back troops so
that DRC can maintain peace within the framework of democracy and
get rid of foreign influence.
</P>
<P>
Troops loyal to Kabila have been fighting against rebel forces
allegedly supported by neighboring Rwanda and Uganda. But DRC has
denied the existence of rebels, insisting that it is invaded by
foreign troops.
</P>
<P>
Mediated by United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan,
leaders of DRC, Rwanda and Uganda reached a ceasefire agreement in
Paris on November 28 to end the fighting in DRC.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is expected to be signed sometime before a
meeting of the Organization of African Unity on December 17-18.

<HEADLINE> Coordination Among Egypt, Jordan, Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said on Monday that coordination among Egypt, Jordan and
the Palestinians is "necessary" before the final-status talks
between the Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Coordination of stances on the final-status talks among Egypt,
Jordan and the Palestinians is "a must," Moussa said when commenting
on the prospect of forming a mechanism for cooperation among the
three parties for the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Moussa was quoted by Egypt's Middle East News Agency as saying
that he has held "fruitful and useful talks" with Jordanian
Foreign Minister Abdul Ilah al-Khatib on the current regional
situation.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is prepared to cooperate and coordinate with Jordan and
the Palestinians in the Palestinian-Israeli talks, he added.
</P>
<P>
Moussa and Osama al-Baz, advisor to President Hosni Mubarak,
met with visiting al-Khatib and Jordanian Chamberlain Jawad Anani
Sunday night and discussed the latest developments in the
Palestinian-Israeli peace process, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to whether it is useful to start the final-status
talks with Israel under the present circumstances, Moussa said
that it is up to the Palestinians to decide when to hold the talks
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Egypt does not decide anything for the Palestinians, it only
provides them with help and follows up the situation, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have been staging demonstrations for days to
protest Israel's release of criminals instead of political
prisoners, the Palestinians jailed for resistance against Israel,
as demanded by the recent land-for-peace interim accord.
</P>
<P>
Israel has threatened to suspend the implementation of the Wye
River agreement, which was signed between the two sides in October
in Washington, before the Palestinians stop street rioting.
</P>
<P>
The deal demands that Israel withdraw troops from another 13
percent of the West Bank in three phases and free 750 Palestinian
prisoners in exchange for Palestinians' tough measures against
anti-Israeli violence.

<HEADLINE> EBRD to Invest Russia by 1 Billion U.S. Dlrs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Bank of
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is going to provide up to 1
billion U.S. dollars for the Russian economy in 1999, the bank's
president Horst Koehler said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Koehler told a briefing after the meeting of the Consultative
Council for Foreign Investments in Russia, that the EBRD will
provide 150 million U.S. dollars by the end of the year to
implement earlier projects.
</P>
<P>
The EBRD is one of the largest direct investors in the Russian
economy. It has provided 3 billion U.S. dollars in investments in
Russia since 1994, according to Koehler.
</P>
<P>
The president said that despite the August economic crisis in
Russia, the EBRD has not given up its plans of investments in the
Russian economy.
</P>
<P>
Koehler also noted that the EBRD is interested in developing
Russia's banking sector and that the bank has already invested
considerable sums in this sector and wants it to operate
efficiently.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Monday's meeting of the Consultative Council for
Foreign Investment in Russia, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov reassured that the Russian government would not ban free
circulation of the U.S. dollar in the country, start
nationalization or stop the privatization of state-owned property.

<HEADLINE> PNC Members Revoke Anti-Israeli Clauses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA CITY, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Palestine
National Council stood up and raised their hands to reaffirm the
revocation of provisions in their national charter calling for
Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
This was a magnificent show of Palestinian support for the
peace process. Almost all the delegates at the Shawa Center raised
their hands when Palestinian national Authority Chairman Yasser
Arafat declared in front of U.S. President Bill Clinton that the
anti-israeli articles had been nullified.
</P>
<P>
This also put an end to the prolonged dispute over Palestinian
charter between Israel and the Palestinians. The show of hands
apparently got the endorsement of the Americans, although it is
now known whether it will satisfy Israeli Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu insisted that the PNC vote to ratify the annulment of
the articles calling for the elimination of the "Zionist regime"
in the covenant, the de facto Palestinian constitution drafted in
1964.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Arafat praised Clinton's role in the
peace-making between Israel and the Palestinians, saying his visit
will definitely boost the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said the Palestinian people's commitment to peace has
already been established, but the continued settlement activities
by Israel and its refusal to release Palestinian prisoners have
reduced mutual trust, which he said should be the base of
peace.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, accompanied by Arafat, was greeted with long-time and
warm clapping by the participants when they entered the convention
center.
</P>
<P>
In his opening address, PNC Speaker Salim Zanoun said the
Palestinians have fulfilled their obligations called for by the
recent land-for-security deal with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian people will be committed to peace, he said.

<HEADLINE> PNC Members Revoke Anti-Israeli Clauses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA CITY, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Bill
Clinton said that members of the Palestine National Council (PNC)
have done "a good thing, a remarkable thing" by reaffirming the
annulment of anti-Israeli articles in their national charter.
</P>
<P>
Almost all PNC members stood up and raised their hands to
reaffirm the revocation of provisions calling for Israel's
destruction.
</P>
<P>
This was a magnificent show of Palestinian support for the
peace process. "Your decision touches the people of Israel," he
said, with his remarks greeted by a long applause by the members.
</P>
<P>
This also put an end to the prolonged dispute over Palestinian
charter between Israel and the Palestinians. The show of hands
apparently got the endorsement of the Americans, although it is
now known whether it will satisfy Israeli Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu insisted that the PNC vote to ratify the annulment of
the articles calling for the elimination of the "Zionist regime"
in the covenant, the de facto Palestinian constitution drafted in
1964.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Arafat praised Clinton's role in the
peace-making between Israel and the Palestinians, saying his visit
will definitely boost the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said the Palestinian people's commitment to peace has
already been established, but the continued settlement activities
by Israel and its refusal to release Palestinian prisoners have
reduced mutual trust, which he said should be the base of peace.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, accompanied by Arafat, was greeted with long-time and
warm applause by the participants when they entered the convention
center.
</P>
<P>
In his opening address, PNC Speaker Salim Zanoun said the
Palestinians have fulfilled their obligations called for by the
recent land-for-security deal with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian people will be committed to peace, he said.

<P>
PARIS, December 14 (Xinhua) -- One police chief was suspended
of his post and two policemen detained after police shot dead with
a stray bullet a 17-year-old youth on Sunday in the
southern-central city of Toulouse.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Jean-Jack Queyranne Monday decided to
suspend a police chief, simply called Brigadier Bois, from his
duty after angry youths staged one day and one night of riots in
three working class districts of Toulouse to protest the death of
their friend.
</P>
<P>
Angry youths set fire to a police station and looted several
shops. They also burned 15 to 20 cars and beat up a bus driver in
the riot.
</P>
<P>
Police intervened by firing tear gas at the rioters who threw
stones and Molotov cocktails at them.
</P>
<P>
Habib Muhammed, also called "Pipo" by his friends, was shot
dead by police as he was trying to flee with a stolen car in a
working class district early Sunday morning. Police said the
bullet which killed Muhammed was shot by accident.
</P>
<P>
But the friends of Muhammed said that police shot six times at
the car and Muhammed was hit by two bullets while an accomplice of
his was unhurt. Muhammed was left uncared for hours before being
sent to a hospital, they said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bus drivers of Toulouse, which is a city of
350,000, staged a strike Monday protesting Sunday's attack on
their colleague by rioters.
</P>
<P>
The public prosecutor of Toulouse Michel Breard said that only
one bullet hit Muhammed and that the autopsy of his body will be
made Monday night.
</P>
<P>
He said that police are also looking for his accomplice who is
an important witness.
</P>
<P>
"Two arms fired, of two different types, one probably being
fired in the air as a shot of warning and it seems that the second
was fired in an accidental manner," he said.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that four policemen were involved in the accident
as they tried to catch Muhammed and his accomplice. A house
guardian called police after seeing a car stolen.
</P>
<P>
Two of the four policemen involved were detained Sunday and
were under investigation by the General Inspection of National
Police.
</P>
<P>
Relations between police and youths in the working class
districts of Toulouse are tense and police said they recently
broke up a gang who robbed banks and attacked shops.

<P>
TEHRAN, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of Iran's powerful
State Expediency Council (SEC) Mohsen Rezaie on Monday attributed
recent mysterious killings in Tehran to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a number of local students in Abadan, southwestern
Khuzestan province, Rezaie said there are signs that implicate the
Zionists (Israelis) in recent murders in a bid to prevent Iran
from attaining its objectives.
</P>
<P>
He did not elaborate what the "signs" or the "objectives" he
was referring to.
</P>
<P>
"The Zionists are launching a misinformation campaign against
Iran and the goal behind such murders is to divide the society and
prevent the government's objectives from being realized," the
Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that a specialized team is busy investigating the issue.
</P>
<P>
More than anyone else, the government is the main target of
such plots, said the secretary of the SEC, the conservative
advisory body to the hard-line supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
He also said there is weakness in the country's security
management, which should be rectified by the government.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several weeks, five government critics, including
three writers and an opposition leader, were killed under
mysterious circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Hard-liners of the country have respectively charged "agents
affiliated to foreign elements" or "unnamed foreigners," or an
exiled opposition party, of carrying out the killings.
</P>
<P>
Iran has not given recognition to Israel, which it dismissed as
the Zionists.

China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, attended

</P>
<P>
"The most significant accomplishment of the Third Plenum was
its reestablishment of the ideological line based on seeking truth
from facts," according to Ye Xuanping, vice-chairman of the CPPCC
National Committee
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping, chief architect of China's economic reform,
outlined the correct road for building socialism with Chinese

socialism.
</P>
<P>
Experience over the past two decades has proved the correctness
of the line, principles and policies formulated during the Third
Plenum. The great significance of this session will further be
displayed in the course of the socialist modernization drive, said
Ye.

The CPPCC, an organization dedicated to patriotic united front
work, focuses on multi-party cooperation and political
consultations under the leadership of the CPC.
</P>
<P>
Ye said the organization has not only implemented the correct
line, principles and policies formulated by the Third Plenum, but
has also adhered to the principle of emancipating minds and
seeking truth from facts over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
CPPCC departments at all levels should unite and expand the
patriotic united front, according to Ye.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet's Lawyers to Fight Moves of Extradition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Former Chilean leader Augusto
Pinochet's lawyers said on Monday they would fight the British
government's decision to authorize extradition proceedings against
the 83-year-old general.
</P>
<P>
They said they would ask the High Court in London to allow them
to challenge Home Secretary (interior minister) Jack Straw's
ruling last Wednesday that the Spanish extradition request against
Pinochet could go ahead in the British courts.
</P>
<P>
"We can confirm we will be seeking leave to apply for a
judicial review of the Home Secretary's decision to issue an
authority to proceed," lawyer Michael Caplan told Reuters.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Britain's upper house of parliament, the House of
Lords, is expected to study one of its earlier rulings which said
Pinochet is not immune from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet's lawyers had challenged the ruling, saying that
Pinochet should enjoy immunity as a former head of state. They
also accused that one of the five Law Lords, who ruled three to
two against Pinochet, was connected to the human rights group
Amnesty International.
</P>
<P>
Straw upheld the Law Lords' ruling and opened the way for lower
British courts to go ahead with considering the extradition case
against Pinochet, who ruled Chile from 1973 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
A Spanish judge wants the retired general extradited to face
charges in Spain. He accused Pinochet of responsibility for the
deaths and disappearances of more than 3,000 people during his
rule.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, who appeared in a London court last Friday, said he
refused to recognize the jurisdiction of any court outside Chile.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Finance Minister Paul
Martin said "no" to the country's two proposed bank mergers here
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I am announcing today that the bank mergers will not be
allowed to proceed because they are not in the best interests of
Canadians," Martin said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The mergers would lead to an unacceptable concentration of
economic powers in the hands of fewer, very large banks," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
"They would result in a significant reduction of competition.
And they would reduce the government's policy flexibility to
address potential future prudential concerns," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Bank of Canada, the largest in the country, proposed
to merge with the third largest bank, the Bank of Montreal, in
January, and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and
Toronto-Dominion Bank announced their intention of merger three
months later.
</P>
<P>
Martin's decision on Monday has slammed the door on these
mega-mergers between Canada's large banks, at least for a year.

BEIJING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The People's Liberation Army
(PLA) and Armed Police will complete the handover of all
businesses to central and local governments by the December 15
deadline.
</P>
<P>
Offices in charge of the handover will enter a new work mode on
Tuesday in order to ensure a smooth transition of business
ventures previously run by PLA and Armed Police units.
</P>
<P>
This transition will represent the final process in
implementing the central government's recent decision to prohibit
the army and armed police units, as well as judiciary departments,
from engaging business activities after the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to ensure judiciary departments divest themselves from
business ventures are on schedule and progressing smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Local observers note that the move to ban related units from
engaging in business activities will be conducive to rectifying
the economic order, improving the effectiveness of anti-corruption
measures and maintaining long-term social stability.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Condemns Mysterious Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran's paramount leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei here on Monday condemned the mysterious
killings of prominent writers in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a group of clerics on the eve of the holy fasting
month of Ramadhan, Khamenei said the killing of citizens whatever
their beliefs may be, was a "crime."
</P>
<P>
He urged the Iranian security and intelligence officials to
seriously follow up the recent killings and kidnappings, which he
strongly believed was a plot against the writers' support for
democracy and freedom.
</P>
<P>
The killings of prominent writers have prompted fears among
the public that the crimes are part of a conspiracy which might
result in more deaths.
</P>
<P>
The office of the Iranian President Mohammad Khatami on Monday
issued a statement, pledging to expeditiously identify and bring
the criminals to justice.
</P>
<P>
In a response to a letter signed by over 140 Majlis
deputies, the statement said that the recent crimes have not
only targeted the lives of the citizens, but it is also an
assault on the prestige of the Islamic Republic of Iran.
</P>
<P>
It assured the public that the issue has been the main
preoccupation of the president during the recent days.
</P>
<P>
"With the formation of the special judicial-security team and
with support of the leadership, there is high hope that the team
will soon have something to report to the nation on the issue,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The president of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the
government, once again reiterate their commitment to defend the
legitimate rights of all the citizens, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Medal-winning Pace Slows Down for China (Day Nine) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 14 (Xinhua) -- China's pace of snatching gold
medals slowed down on Monday with only 5 adding to their haul
while South Korea further enlarged their lead over Japan to 42-35.
</P>
<P>
With the athletics competitions in full swing, China found a
new gold mine in track and field as four of the five golds they
won on Monday came from the Thammasat Stadium while the remaining
one from their mixed doubles paddlers.
</P>
<P>
But at the same time they found their target of winning 18-20
gold medals from the 45 at stake might be an impossible mission.
</P>
<P>
China only managed to win the women's 10km walk, men's shot
put, women's 100 meters and heptathlon but suffered defeates in
the women's javelin, women's 1,500 and 10,000 meters which they
used to enjoying a comfortable domination.
</P>
<P>
In the most eye-catching men's 100 meters sprint, Japan's Koji
Ito further proved he was the fastest man in Asia by clocking a
10.05 for the title.
</P>
<P>
Koji, who set a new Asian record of 10.00 in Sunday's
semi-finals, bolted off from the block to take the win with a
clear leading margin.
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps I failed to live up to people's expectation to run
under 10 seconds, but I hope I had excited every one," Koji said.
</P>
<P>
Asian record holder Li Xuemei of China became the fastest woman
of Asia after overcoming a fever and stomach problem to win the
women's 100 meters in 11.05.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old, who holds the Asian record of 10.79, met no
fierce challenge since the withdrawal of Sri Lanka's S. Jayasinghe
made the race Li's sole show.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka is a surprise winner on Monday as its athletes took
two gold medals in just 10 minutes to end a gold-drought history
of 24 years.
</P>
<P>
India, Qatar and South Korea also made their impact in the
Asiad athletics by winning one gold each on Monday.
</P>
<P>
With Thailand's unbelievable victory over South Korea, the
Asiad soccer tournament heated up on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The host team, which took a 1-0 lead but was reduced to 9
players later in the second half, hung on to score a golden goal
six minutes into extra time to eliminate the pre-tournament
favorites South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The other teams qualifying for the semi-finals are China, Iran
and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
China will have to take on Iran for the second time in the
tournament when they meet in the semi-finals. They lost to the
Iranians 1-3 in the second round group competitions.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait will have an easier job in the match against Thailand as
the host team will play without two of their starters due to
suspension.
</P>
<P>
With Kim Tae Hyun winning the men's over 105kg class, the
weightlifting tournament of the Asiad came to an end.
</P>
<P>
China was the biggest winner in the sport by winning 7 golds in
women's competitions and 4 in men's classes.
</P>
<P>
Yet Chinese weightlifting officials said they were not in a
mood for celebration. "We lag behind in adjusting to the new
classification of the categories introduced early this year by the
International Weightlifting Federation," said Chinese head coach
Yang Hanxiong. "We also failed to keep well-informed of our
potential rivals in other countries."
</P>
<P>
Despite achieving mediocre results on Monday, China still
remains the run-away leader in medal table with 84 gold, 58 silver
and 41 bronze medals.
</P>
<P>
South Korea showed its determination of surpassing Japan by
taking 7 golds on Monday to post a record of 42-25-34. Japan
only added three golds to its pocket to place third at 35-37-46.

WASHINGTON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- House Republican leaders called on President Bill Clinton to
resign on Sunday to spare the country the tumult of the first
impeachment vote on the House floor in 130 years. But hours
before they spoke, the president had made clear he would not even
consider leaving the White House voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton struggled on Sunday to rescue the
floundering Middle East peace agreement he brokered this fall,
exhorting Israelis and Palestinians to overcome a "history of
heartbreak and loss" despite ongoing violence and hatred.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- With the full House returning for a vote on impeachment this
week, President Bill Clinton on Sunday rebuffed Republican calls
for him to admit to lying under oath and said flatly that he had
not committed perjury. Looking grim, he deflected suggestions
that he should step down. "I have no intention of resigning," he
said, "It's never crossed my mind."

<HEADLINE> Philippines May Tap Miyazawa Fund to Save Airline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
Monday is looking at the possible use of the Miyazawa fund from
Japan in its bid to rehabilitate the debt-strapped Philippine
Airlines (PAL).
</P>
<P>
Edgardo Espiritu, secretary of the Department of Finance, told
reporters Monday the government may take this option if there
continues to be no progress in negotiations by PAL with
prospective foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
He said using the Miyazawa fund for corporate debt
restructuring has been done in other Southeast Asian countries
such as Thailand and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"Considering the importance of PAL as flagship carrier, we're
now looking under the Miyazawa initiative a support for corporate
debt restructuring," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Miyazawa option would involve offering PAL shares to
the public, not only to the present stockholders.
</P>
<P>
The Miyazawa fund initiative is a 30 billion U.S. dollar
Japanese aid program for crisis-hit economies in the region. It
was named after its proponent, Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa.
</P>
<P>
Asked how much of the Miyazawa fund the government aims to tap,
Espiritu said the government is looking at a requirement of 150
million U.S. dollars for PAL to become viable.
</P>
<P>
He said the terms of the loan will have to be negotiated with
the Japanese government, the Japanese Export-Import Bank and the
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund.

<HEADLINE> Canada's F-18 Fleet to Get in Improvements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian air force has
embarked on a big program to extend the life of its F-18 fighter
jets, National Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The first part of the plan will spend 66 million Canadian
dollars (42.9 million U.S. dollars) to install modern computers
and software.
</P>
<P>
The final bill for the modernization project is estimated at
1.2 billion Canadian dollars (780 million U.S. dollars) over the
next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The plan includes the potential sale of 22 or more of the
fleet's 122 F-18s to help raise funds to modernize the remainder.
The jets could then fly to the year 2017, 14 years past their
original retirement date.
</P>
<P>
The modernization program is in addition to a major overhaul on
the F-18 bulkhead walls, which in June were discovered to have
cracks much earlier than forecast.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen F-18s were hauled in October 16 to fix the problem,
which occurs in a high-stress area where the wings are attached.
Other aircraft are scheduled for repairs over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
The most expensive cockpit upgrade is the installation of new
radars, expected to cost 500 million Canadian dollars (325 million
U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Two Games Records Smashed as Track Cycling Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Two Asian Games records were
smashed as track cycling events began here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's Ji Sung-Hwan set the new Asian Games record in
the men's 1-km time trial, timing one minute 5.406 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The previous record of 1:05.851 was set by Japan's Masanaga
Shiohara at the Hiroshima four years ago.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect a gold medal today because the Japanese rider
is very strong. I just tried my best," said the 27-year-old Ji,
who beat Olympic bronze medalist Jumonji Takanabu of Japan to
second.
</P>
<P>
Takanabu pocketed the silver while Chen Keng Hsien from Chinese
Taipei came third.
</P>
<P>
The other record-breaking moment came in the qualification
round for men's sprint, where Yuichiro Kamiyama timed a blazing
10.567 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The past mark of 10.733 seconds was also created in Hiroshima
by Japanese Toshinobu Saito.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, Evgeniy Vakker of Kyrgyzstan entered Tuesday's
men's 4-km individual pursuit semi-finals to clash against Japan's
Noriyuki Iijima.
</P>
<P>
The other semi-final will pit defending champion Vadim
Kravchenko against China's Shi Guijun.
</P>
<P>
In women's 3-km individual pursuit, China's defending champion

<P>
BANGKOK, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The youngest athlete at the
13th Asian Games is table tennis player A-Rahman Al-Hammadi of
Qatar, according to the Games Accreditation Center.
</P>
<P>
Al-Hammadi was born in 1987. However, his young age does not
mean that he is competing illegally.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Games Constitution allows each separate sports
federation to set their own age restrictions. So ages vary
according to each sport. The minimum age for sepkta takraw is 15
while for gymnastics 16 and for judo 18. But the federations for
swimming and table tennis have no age restrictions at all.
</P>
<P>
Other youngsters competing in the games are table tennis player
Nasser Al-Muhannadi and Jassim Al-Sullaiti, and swimmer Ammar
Al-Ejji. All of them are from Qatar and were born in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Other 12 years old are Kuwait table tennis player Ibrahem Al
Hasan and Macao swimmer Cheong Weng-Lom, who competed in the 100
meters and 200 meters freestyle.

<HEADLINE> Nepali King Returns Home Amid Political Uncertainty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 14 (Xinhua) -- After a detailed medical
check-up and treatment in London, Nepali King Birendra returned
home Monday evening amid a new round of political uncertainty
arising from a ruling partner's withdrawal from the government.
</P>
<P>
Waiting for the constitutional monarch are two conflicting
submissions made respectively by Prime Minister Girija Prasad
Koirala for dissolution of parliament for fresh polls and 62
members of parliament for a special session of parliament.
</P>
<P>
After sharing power with the Nepali Congress (NC) for three and
a half months, the Communist Party of Nepal (Marxism-Leninism,
CPN-ML) pulled out last Thursday, alleging that the NC had failed
to implement the agreements reached with it and other left parties
in August.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Prime Minister and NC President Girija Prasad
Koirala made a recommendation to the Royal Palace for dissolution
of parliament for general elections on March 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The NC said that given the present political situation in the
country, there was no other alternative to holding free, fair and
impartial general elections for a fresh popular mandate.
</P>
<P>
Hours later, the CPN-ML and its supporters requested the Royal
Palace to convene a special session of parliament to discuss a
no-confidence motion they are planning to table against the NC
government.
</P>
<P>
Man Mohan Adhikari, chairman of the main opposition Communist
Party of Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML), said that the
demand for a special session was positive.
</P>
<P>
He said that his party would not side with Prime Minister
Koirala if a special session of parliament is called.
</P>
<P>
The party's General Secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal said that his
party would not join the NC minority government unless the latter
formally agrees to form a national government of all major
political parties for the sole purpose of free and fair elections.
</P>
<P>
The faction of the National Democratic Party (RPP) led by
former prime minister Surya Bahadur Thapa, the third largest party
in parliament, also held that free and fair elections are the only
way out.
</P>
<P>
The party, which joined the CPN-ML in calling for a special
session of parliament, demanded a national government representing
all parties for the elections.
</P>
<P>
It may be recalled that in February this year, King Birendra,
on the advice of the Supreme Court, accepted the submission by 96
MPs to call a special session of parliament, turning down Prime
Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa's call for dissolution of parliament
for fresh elections.
</P>
<P>
The Himalayan kingdom has witnessed five governments since
November 1994 when the mid-term polls produced a hung parliament
where no single party holds a majority.
</P>
<P>
The 53-year-old king was struck by cardiac ischaemia on
November 4. Press reports here said that he had a successful
angioplasty with stent implantation on November 23 at Cromwell
hospital in London.

<HEADLINE> Organization Department Heads Meet in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese Communist
Party official today urged all organization departments in China
to work under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory, promote reform
and conduct in-depth investigations in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Quanjing, head of the Organization Department of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, summerized major
achievements organization departments have recorded over the past
year. Zhang presented his summary at today's closing session of a
conference attended by the heads of organization departments of
the Party in various provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities.
</P>
<P>
He cited new upsurges in studies of Deng Xiaoping Theory,
elections for both central and local government bodies,
improvements in grass roots organizations in state-owned
enterprises and rural areas, and implementation of the new
regulation for selecting Party and government leaders as the
principal achievements in 1998.
</P>
<P>
He outlined seven major tasks for the coming year, and called
for further improvements in establishing a leading body
responsible for the management of the nation's officials. He said
the existing management system should be reformed on the basis of
summarizing past experience.
</P>
<P>
A supervisory system will be established to oversee the
promotion of officials, and resolute measures will be adopted to
halt unhealthy tendencies involving appointments, said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Party building in grass roots units and efforts to educate
Party members should be strengthened, with special emphasis on
rural areas and enterprises. Officials of organization departments
should continually strive for improved quality, according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
He referred to reform of the personnel system and noted that "we
must implement the policy of ensuring both ability and integrity
when selecting officials and thereafter adhering to the principle of
Party management." He said the process of selecting officials
should involve thorough assessments carried out in a democratic
manner.
</P>
<P>
A major 1999 system reformation task centers on introducing an
open, fair and competitive system for selecting officials, said
Zhang.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The visit by Turkmenistan's
Foreign Minister Boris Shikhmurdev to Pakistan has been postponed
owing to his illness, official sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Turkmen foreign minister was scheduled to arrive in

the long-standing Afghan problem.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have agreed during the visit by Pakistan's
State Minister for Foreign Affairs Siddique Khan Kanju to

<HEADLINE> China's Dominance Blurred in Men's Weightlifting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 14 (Xinhua) -- With a lone world record
broken by South Korea, China can no longer boast of its dominance
in the men's weightlifting in Asia although it took half of the
golds at stake in the Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
As the strongmen bid farewell to the drum-beating Thai fans on
Monday, China halved the eight gold medals with two more silvers,
as Iran, Kazakhstan and South Korea all crowned in other four
events, indicating the coming of more fierce competitions in the
future.
</P>
<P>
"Our dominance in the continent is disappearing, the trio of
Iran, South Korea and Kazakhstan have stepped up fast to challenge
us, even in our strong events," said Yang Hanxiong, head coach of
the Chinese weightlifting team.
</P>
<P>
In the men's 69-kg class, which China claimed as a sure bet for
gold, Wan Jianhui was beaten to the second by South Korean Kim
Hak-Bong who lifted 195kgs to break the jerk world record of
190kgs.
</P>
<P>
The 105kg class was tipped as another event with the gold
surely to be taken away by China's Cui Wenhua, however Cui lagged
behind five kgs in jerk and only realized his champion dream after
chief rival Sergey Kopytov of Kazakhstan attempted a too heavy
weight in the snatch.
</P>
<P>
"Although we have met our pre-Asiad goal in the sport, we're
not in a mood for celebration as we lag behind in adjusting to the
new classification of the categories introduced early this year by
the International Weightlifting Federation and we also fail to
keep well-informed of our potential rivals in other countries,"
coach Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the four for China, South Korea bagged home two
golds, one silver and two bronzes, with the other two coveted gold
medals taken by Iran and Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
The victory podium also witnessed the footsteps of strongmen
from Myanmar, Chinese Taipei, DPR Korea, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Thailand and Uzbekistan, indicating the rapid development of the
sport in Asia.

<TEXT>
<P>
1989 -- The Enlarged Meeting of the Central Military Commission
was held in Beijing between December 10-12, 1989. Jiang Zemin,
chairman of the commission, made a speech at the meeting, pointing
out that strengthening the party's absolute leadership of the army
is a cardinal principle in the make up of the army and is also a
long lasting tradition of the party and underlines the army's
unique political superiority. It must be maintained and continued.
</P>
<P>
In a speech during the meeting on December 12, Deng Xiaoping
pointed out that defining the CPC Central Committee with Jiang
Zemin at the core was a correct choice by the whole party. Jiang
was qualified chairman of the Central Military Commission, he
said, because of his credentials as general secretary of the CPC
Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
1990 -- Jiang Zemin paid an official visit to the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea between March 14-16, 1990. This was
Jiang's first visit abroad following his election as general
secretary of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Third Plenary Session of the 7th NPC was held in Beijing
between March 20-April 4. It passed a decision on the Basic Law of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the
People's Republic of China and ratified the decision for
establishing the First HKSAR Government and Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
The session also passed a resolution on the 'Acceptance of Deng
Xiaoping's Resignation' from the Chairman of the Central Military
Commission of the People's Republic of China and elected Jiang
Zemin to take over that post.
</P>
<P>
On December 24, during a meeting with senior party officials,
Deng Xiaoping said that it was vital to seize the chance to solve
China's major development problems. He said that it must be
understood theoretically the essential difference between
socialism and capitalism is not merely a matter of introducing a
planned or market economy.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Host Regional Economic Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Officials from Bangladesh,
India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Thailand will meet here between
December 17 and 19 to discuss economic cooperation among the five
countries sharing contiguous land or sea boundary.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing here on Monday, Foreign Minister Abdus
Samad Azad said senior officials of the five countries, which
comprise the Bangladesh-India-Myanmar-Sri Lanka-Thailand Economic
Cooperation (BIMST-EC) forum, would gather here on Thursday and
Friday to finalize economic projects.
</P>
<P>
And on Saturday, state or deputy ministers of the five
countries would meet here to officially adopt the projects, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The BIMST-EC forum, a sub-regional grouping, was formally
launched in Bangkok, Thailand in June 1997 to promote economic
cooperation among three members of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and two members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
The coming meeting of the BIMST-EC was "very important in the
context of regional cooperation," as the meeting would be a show
of "Asian solidarity and pave the way for enhancing South-South
cooperation... in the face of challenges posed by international
trade systems," Azad told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Members of the BIMST-EC had earlier selected eight priority
areas for cooperation, including trade, investment and industry,
technology, infrastructure and transport, tourism, energy,
agriculture and human resources development, according to the
foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Bangladesh hosted a bazaar of products from
the five BIMST-EC member countries, the first economic and
business event within the framework of the BIMST-EC since its
establishment.

On June 9, 1989, Deng Xiaoping, while meeting with the army
generals charged with enforcing martial law, pointed out that
turmoil was inevitable, and would be dictated by both the
political climate abroad and within China. The core of the
question was that there was a movement to subvert China and the
Party, all aimed at establishing a capitalist republic which would
be totally subordinate to western powers.
</P>
<P>
Deng said that these events forced China to look at the past as
well as the future and it was realized that the biggest mistake
during the ten years was in underestimating the importance of
political education. China must steadfastly implement and adhere
to the policies and principles dictated by the Third Plenary
Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, and they included
summing up the experience, continuing to adhere to what is right
corrcting what is wrong, and improving what is weak.
</P>
<P>
on June 23-24, 1989, the Fourth Plenum of the 11th CPC Central
Committee was held. A report focusing on "Comrade Zhao Ziyang's
mistakes during the anti-Party and anti-socialism turmoil" was
adopted at the plenum. Zhao was deprived of all his status and
positions of power. Those attending the plenum elected Jiang Zemin
as general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, as well as new
members to the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the
CPC Central Committee, and reorganized the secretariat of the CPC
Central Committee. Jiang Zemin delivered a speech on June 24,
which made clear the need for adhering to the fundamental policies
adopted since the Third Plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
On September 4, Deng Xiaoping pointed out during a meeting with
several central leading officials that China should observe the
international situation carefully and with a cool head,
</P>
<P>
China should oppose corruption, and establish a brand of
politics clear of bad influences, and we must oppose corruption in
the entire process of reform and opening-up, Deng Xiaoping
declared on September 16 of 1989 during a meeting with Chinese
American professor Tsung-dao Lee.
</P>
<P>
On November 6-9, the Fifth Plenum of the 13th CPC Central
Committee was held. Adopted at the meeting was a resolution to
improve and deepen the reform while also overcoming any problems
which had arisen since the beginning of the reform. The meeting
accepted Deng Xiaoping's resignation from the position of chairman
of the Central Military Commission, appointing Jiang Zemin to
take on that role.

<HEADLINE> Govt Admits Fighting With UNITA in Central Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government has
admitted for the first time that the government forces has been
engaged in fierce fighting with UNITA forces, and blamed the
United Nations and international community for the worsening
situation.
</P>
<P>
Joao Batisata De Matos, Chief of General Staff of the Angolan
army, said in Huambo Province Sunday that the offensive
code-named "Dark Action", launched by the UNITA on December 1,
was aimed at capturing the capital cities of Huambo and Bie
Provinces and then lead its military action into other areas of
the country.
</P>
<P>
De Matos said that what the government forces are doing is a
response to the actions taken by the rebel National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), the Angolan News Agency
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The government troops are facing the UNITA military forces
much better armed than in the 1992-94 civil war period, with
tanks, assault vehicles, long-range artillery, and the back-up of
some mercenaries.
</P>
<P>
The deteriorating situation in the country, the chief of
general staff said, is a result of the passive stance of the
United Nations over UNITA's refusal to implement the Lusaka Peace
Protocol.
</P>
<P>
He said that the international community has been condemning
the government forces for its large-scale military in central
part of the country, while the UNITA forces are conducting
massive military build-up there.
</P>
<P>
De Matos stressed that the government forces are capable of
controlling the situation and accomplish its task of safeguarding
the Lusaka Peace Protocol.

<HEADLINE> World Experts Proclaim HK's Effort in Containing Avian Flu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 14 (Xinhua) -- World health experts and
scientists on influenza have recently expressed strong gratitude
and appreciation for Hong Kong's effort in containing avian
flu (H5N1) that occurred in the city last year.
</P>
<P>
In a joint proclamation the experts said as soon as human cases
of infection with influenza A (H5N1) viruses were identified the
Hong Kong Department of Health "mounted a multi-disciplinary,
international investigation which provided the background that was
necessary to understand the source and scope of the human
infections."
</P>
<P>
"In December of 1997, the people and government of Hong Kong
voluntarily eradicated approximately 1.6 million poultry in an
attempt to halt further human infections by the influenza A (H5N1)
virus," the proclamation said.
</P>
<P>
At the time, the action was considered controversial by many
and the outcome was uncertain. In retrospect, that action may have
saved the world from an influenza pandemic, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
On the control of the spread on influenza, they pointed out
that at the first hint of a pandemic, prompt and decisive action
must be taken by the custodians of the people's health.
</P>
<P>
In concluding, the experts applauded the leadership of Hong
Kong in taking such vigorous and carefully considered action
against the avian virus outbreak of a year ago.
</P>
<P>
In reviewing the situation in Hong Kong, Deputy Director of
Health of Hong Kong and Chairman of the Inter-Departmental
Coordinating Committee on Avian Flu Paul Saw said Monday the
"absence of new human cases of avian flu in almost a year is most
encouraging, but we must not be complacent."
</P>
<P>
"This is necessary as influenza viruses are endemic in this
part of the world and they have the ability to mutate," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The public should remain vigilant and maintain good health and
strong immunity against the disease while surveillance for
influenza in human and in poultry should be maintained and
international collaboration intensified."

<HEADLINE> Regional Analysts Look Forward to 1999 with Optimism in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Asian Strategists and
economists of the Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, a global financial
services firm, here Monday announced their forecast for the coming
year, taking a positive view about the region.
</P>
<P>
Summarizing the outlook for 1999, Vineet Nagrani, co-head of
Asian Research of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, told a press
briefing that the team looks forward to the next year in Asia with
optimism rather than either hope or trepidation.
</P>
<P>
Markus Rosgen, regional strategist of the firm, said: "While we
believe that the volatility we have been seeing throughout the
region will continue through the next year, the last few months of
1998 has seen a real turnaround in many of the markets and we
believe that this upward trend will continue."
</P>
<P>
At the same press briefing, Senior Regional Economist Tim
Condon outlined his views on regional economies, saying that
seldom has the potential for Asia to deliver high-quality growth
-- growth that rewards both labor and capital -- been as great as
it is now.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the theme of restructuring in the crisis
economies of South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia is
likely to be subordinated, at least initially, to the theme of
economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
"The focus will be on identifying signs that these economies
have bottomed and on gauging the pace at which growth resumes", he
 said.
</P>
<P>
On Hong Kong's economy, Rosgen said it may stop contracting
towards the end of 1999 and may rebound somewhat in 2000. "We
believe sustained economic recovery depends on structural reforms
that will restore Hong Kong's competitiveness."
</P>
<P>
"We believe 1999 will continue to be a year of adjustment for
Hong Kong although it is likely to be much less severe than 1998,"
Rosgen said.
</P>
<P>
He said the equity market will be driven by declining interest
rates with an earnings recovery expected to occur toward the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
Turning to China's mainland, the team said 1999 will be one of
consolidation for the mainland, and that it will aim to allow the
existing reforms to take root before introducing new ones.
</P>
<P>
The economists are confident that China will maintain a
relatively high growth rate of 15 percent for state-sector
investment next year, which is sufficient to maintain a GDP growth
rate at a level similar to 1998.
</P>
<P>
As long as China continues to maintain reforms and stability it
will be able to achieve not only high but also quality growth in
the medium and long term, they said.
</P>
<P>
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter has a long-standing presence in Asia
in terms of both capital and resources. Through its major regional
offices in Hong Kong, Tokyo and 11 other Asian centers the firm
provides investment banking, secondary markets and a range of
other institutional and private client financial services.

February 26,1989 -- Stability is an overriding issue among
China's problems, Deng Xiaoping pointed out while meeting with
the then U.S. President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
on April 15, Hu Yaobang passed away. Various mourning
activities were held by people and students. But, a small number
of people took advantage of this to spread rumors, attacking the
Party and state leaders, inciting the people to oppose the
leadership of the Party and the socialist system.
</P>
<P>
The People's Daily, the organ of the CPC Central Committee,
carried an editorial saying that there must be a clear-cut stand
against unrest on April 26. That unrest developed into turmoil
because of the support and connivance of Zhao Ziyang. The
so-called "Federation of Autonomous Student Unions", an illegal
student organization, urged its supporters to stage a hunger
strike in Tian'anmen Square beginning on May 13.
</P>
<P>
The State Council decided to declare a martial law in parts of
Beijing starting from May 20. However, the organizers of the
unrest and those scheming in the background took advantage of the
restraints of the government and troops, and went about organizing
various illegal activities which led to a counter revolutionary
rebellion. The State Council repealed martial law conditions on
parts of Beijing on January 11, 1990.
</P>
<P>
On May 16, 1989, Sino-Soviet relations were normalized
according to an announcement made by Deng Xiaoping during his
meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev, the then president of the
Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR and the then general
secretary of the Soviet Communist Party.

<HEADLINE> China to Increase Fiscal Expenditure in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- China intends to change its
previously long-term tight financial policy next year and will
increase expenditure, finance minister Xiang Huaicheng told
Chinese legislators today.
</P>
<P>
"The change in policy is to help boost economic growth and
offset the continuing effect of Asian financial crisis," Xiang said
when reporting the completion of the 1998 budget to deputies of
the NPC who are on an organized visit to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"Because of the increasing effects of the Asian financial
difficulties and an upsurge in problems within the domestic
economy, exports and foreign investment will make less
contributions to China's economic growth," Xiang said.
</P>
<P>
"Those negative factors affecting domestic investment and
consumption will not change dramatically," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Under such circumstances, an active and ongoing financial
policy is needed to stimulate domestic demand and increase
government expenditure; otherwise the beneficial effects of this
year's active financial policies will be weakened and the economic
growth rate may also drop," he warned.
</P>
<P>
"If unexpected and unwanted difficulties occur this could
result not just in a reduction of the nation's overall income but
there is a danger that unemployment along with other social and
economic woes would become prevalent." said Xiang. "And the
reform of state-owned enterprises, the grain circulation system
and other similar programs would lack any proper foundation. It
may be that as a result both domestic and world confidence in the
Chinese economy might be affected."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Xiang said that China must spend more on
water conservancy projects, the construction of more solid dykes,
preservation of the environment and the rebuilding of homes and
factories in the flood-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
"These require a considerable increase in expenditure most
of which must be made next year," Xiang added.
</P>
<P>
And as the Party and government have decreed, the armed forces,
armed police along with political and judicial bodies shall
abandon all commercial activities. "As a result the government
must provide more money for their operational activities",
according Xiang.
</P>
<P>
He went on to explain that in order to ensure even the basic
livlihoods of laid-off workers, the government will be obliged to
provide more aid and financial support.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Condemns Mysterious Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran's paramount leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei here on Monday condemned the mysterious
killings of prominent writers in Iran in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a group of clerics on the eve of the holy fasting
month of Ramadhan, Khamenei said the killing of citizens whatever
their beliefs may be, was a "crime," the Islamic Republic News
Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Iranian security and intelligence officials to
seriously follow up the recent killings and kidnapings, which he
strongly believed was the work of the enemies. The events have
prompted the fear among the public that the crimes are part of a
conspiracy which might result in more deaths.
</P>
<P>
The office of the Iranian President Mohammad Khatami on
Monday issued a statement, pledging to expeditiously identify and
bring the criminals to justice.
</P>
<P>
In a response to a letter signed by over 140 Majlis deputies,
the statement said that the recent crimes have not only targeted
the lives of the citizens, but also it is an assault on the
prestige of the Islamic Republic of Iran.
</P>
<P>
It assured the public that the issue has been the main
preoccupation of the president during the recent days.
</P>
<P>
"With the formation of the special judicial-security team and
with support of the leadership, there is high hope that the

<HEADLINE> Sino-US Ties Hailed At Beijing Reception </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 14 (Xinhua)-- China and the United States
today expressed their willingness to jointly strive for
intensified Sino-US relations and friendship in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a reception marking the 20th anniversary of the
establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries,
Qi Huaiyuan, president of the Chinese People's Association for
Friendship with Foreign Countries (CPAFFC), said the two nations
should be engaged in "concerted efforts to extend areas of
cooperation and intensify exchanges in order to promote greater
progress over the next two decades."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to China James Sasser pointed to the fact that
the productive dialogue the two nations have on a full range of
issues "will determine the destiny of the two countries in the
21st century".
</P>
<P>
Qi and Sasser agreed that the highly successful exchanges
between Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Bill
Clinton have elevated Sino-U.S. relations to a new stage of
development. They also agreed that the constructive strategic
partnership will help to establish a new framework for bilateral
relations geared to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan was among the guests
present at the reception, which was sponsored by the CPAFFC, the
Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs and the
China-U.S. People's Friendship Association.
</P>
<P>
Qi also pointed to increasing high-level visits and
consultations, as well as active people-to-people contacts over
the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
"The course of development in relations shows that abiding by
the principles enshrined in the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques,
acting in the spirit of seeking common ground while setting aside
difference and pursuing mutual respect, equality and benefits, as
well as expanding cooperation will lead to the development of
sound, stable and sustained development," said Qi.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States published a joint communique on
December 16, 1978, announcing formal establishment of diplomatic
relations effective January 1, 1979.

<HEADLINE> South China Sea Drilling Program Scheduled for 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-seven Chinese and foreign
scientists will initiate a drilling program in the South China Sea
next spring as part of an effort to study "the history of monsoons
in East Asian" and "the impact on the global climate".
</P>
<P>
The program, which will commence in Fremantle, Australia, on
February 16 and end in Hong Kong on April 13, will include
drilling projects at six selected sites in the South China Sea,
according to Professor Wang Pinxian. Wang, who will direct the
project along with an American scientist, made the remarks during
a symposium held today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the program will help scientists learn more about
the evolution of the natural phenomenon and may help to resolve
questions concerning "links between the uplift on the Tibetan
Plateau and the Asian monsoons", as well as "the denudation of
forests, the carbon cycle and global cooling".
</P>
<P>
More than 20 countries have participated in oceanic studies
program, with China joining the international Ocean Drilling
Program some eight months ago. The program's major contribution
centers on helping to prove the theory concerning movement of the
earth's plates.
</P>
<P>
Wang, director of Tongji University's Marine Geology Laboratory
in Shanghai, noted that nine Chinese scientists familiar with the
geological structure in the South China Sea will participate in
next year's program. He said the record number of Chinese
scientists participating will greatly benefit the nation's
scientific studies.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Expects Bigger Earnings from Palm Oil Exports in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia expects higher
earnings from palm oil exports this year despite estimated lower
palm oil production, Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The earnings from palm oil exports for the year of 1998 are
expected to be 21 billion ringgit (5.526 billion U.S. dollars)
compared with 12.1 billion ringgit (3.184 billion U.S. dollars) in
1997 despite estimated lower palm oil production to 8.3 million
tons in 1998 from 9.1 million tons in 1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that production was much affected by the El-Nino as well
as La-Nina weather phenomenon, Lim said the increase in earnings
was due to higher prices.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark palm oil February contract was traded Monday at
2,228 ringgit (about 586.31 U.S. dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
Lim expected the price will remain firm next year unless
exchange rate of the U.S dollar now fixed at 3.8 ringgit changes
drastically.
</P>
<P>
He also expected demand will be strong next year with a growing
affluent population and a shortage of fats and edible oils supply.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is one of the major palm oil producers and exporters
in the world.

by the Palestine National Council to nullify the anti-Israel
clauses in the Palestinian national charter and stopping
anti-Israel incitement.
</P>
<P>
But other Israeli sources here said Monday that, in fact, the
Israeli side has asked U.S. President Bill Clinton to tell
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat that Israel wants the next troop
withdrawal, slated for December 18, to be delayed for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived in Gaza Monday on a one-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Under the Wye River Accord signed recently, another 5 percent
of the West Bank under exclusive control by Israel will be turned
into joint Israeli-Palestinian jurisdiction on December 18.
</P>
<P>
Due to the opposition from the ruling parties and some cabinet
ministers, it is difficult for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
to order further redeployment right now.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu called his core cabinet members for a meeting Monday
morning to discuss clinton's visit to the region, but nothing has
been announced.
</P>
<P>
On Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon, Mordechai said if
the Lebanese government troops take charge of security inside the
Israeli security zone, it will be no problem for Israel to pull out
its forces.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in 1985 in south
Lebanon with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Albright is accompanying Clinton on his current trip to Israel
and Palestinian self-rule area.

<HEADLINE> ICC Plans to Investigate Match-fixing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 14 (Xinhua) -- International Cricket
Council (ICC), world cricket's governing body, said Monday it was
planning a probe into increasing allegations of match fixing and
betting that have rocked the game to its foundations.
</P>
<P>
ICC president Jagmohan Dalmiya was quoted as saying that the
situation had reached a point where the ICC "can no more sit on
the fence" and ignore the effects of the allegations.
</P>
<P>
The ICC move follows recent confessions by Australian stars
Shane Warne and Mark Waugh that they took money from a bookmaker
for providing information on weather and pitches during a tour of
Sri Lanka in 1994, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
Australian cricket authorities admitted that they had covered
up the incident.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Secessionists Warned of Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Defense Minister
Chitalu Sampa has warned the Barotseland secessionists of firm
government action as the Barotse Patriotic Front (BPF) was
lobbying southern African countries to support its mission.
</P>
<P>
Sampa said if those advocating secession continued with their
subversive activities, the government would be forced to use the
necessary laws to deal with them, without indicating what
measures the government would take, the government-owned
Times of Zambia reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Responding to BPF threats of a military conflict if the
governments of Zambia and other Southern African Development
Community (SADC) members did not grant secession, Sampa said," We
have made it clear that we shall never allow any piece of Zambian
soil to be taken away."
</P>
<P>
"Those who want to leave this country should do so peacefully.
We have given them enough leeway because of democracy. But they
should not take the government for granted," the defence
minister noted.
</P>
<P>
He added the government would reply accordingly if the
secessionists resorted to any means.
</P>
<P>
The BPF, a Lozi secessionist group which has been in the past
years striving for the breakaway of Western Province or former
Barotseland, from the central government, said Sunday it had
embarked on a campaign among SADC states to support its Barotse
Republic idea.
</P>
<P>
BPF leader, Imasiku Mutangelwa said in an interview in Lusaka
that the BPF was currently on a tour of all SADC members
informing them of the impending breakaway of Barotseland and if
need be, war with Zambia.
</P>
<P>
He said he had visited several southern African countries
informing them that the movement was serious and requesting the
member states to assist in averting the war.
</P>
<P>
"We shall not announce when war will break out to fight for
what is ours," he said, warning that soon ethnic wars that had
taken place elsewhere in Africa would be in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Barotseland was a half-independent protectorate under the
British colonial rule before it became part of Zambia when the
country won its independence from Britain in 1964. Endite

<HEADLINE> Chronicle of Major Events in China Since 1978 (2-1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The following is the second
part of the Chronicle of major events that have taken place
since the Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC), as compiled by the CPC Central
Committee's Party Literature Research Center:
</P>
<P>
January 16, 1987 -- An enlarged session was held by the
Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, at which the
resignation of Hu Yaobang from the position of general secretary
of the CPC Central Committee was accepted. The seventh plenum of
the 12th CPC Central Committee confirmed this decision on October
20 of the same year.
</P>
<P>
February 6, 1987 -- Both planning and marketing are ways to
develop productive forces, and the planned economy should no
longer be regarded as the mainstay of the economy, said Deng
Xiaoping while talking with several central leading officials.
</P>
<P>
January 14, 1988 -- The CPC Central Committee sent a telegram
to the Central Committee of the Kuomintang, offering its
condolence on the death of Jiang Jingguo, chairman of the
Kuomintang Central Committee. A leading official of the CPC
Central Committee, in a talk, reiterated that the policy of
peaceful reunification of the motherland remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
March 25-April 13, 1988 -- The first session of the 7th
National People's Congress (NPC) was held. An amendment to the
constitution was adopted at the session which added the following
articles to the constitution: "The country allows the private
economy's existence and development in accordance with the law;
the private economy is a supplement to the socialist public-owned
economy; the country protects the private economy's legal rights
and interests, while guiding, supervising, and managing the
private economy; and land use right can be transferred in line
with the law".
</P>
<P>
Adopted at the session were also some resolutions such as those
on establishing the drafting committee of the basic law of the
Macao Special Administrative Region and on establishing Hainan
Province and the Hainan special economic zone. Yang Shangkun was
elected as state president, Wan Li as chairman of the NPC Standing
Committee, Deng Xiaoping as chairman of the Central Military
Commission, and Li Peng appointed as premier of the State
Council.

<HEADLINE> Army Contributes to China's Economic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- China's armed forces have
played an important part in the country's economic development and
in helping fight natural disorders, an official report discloses.
</P>
<P>
In the last twenty years it is estimated that troops have
participated in the construction of over 10,000 key projects,
including the first expressway in China (Shenyang to Dalian), the
Three Gorges project, and the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station.
</P>
<P>
The facilities that China's military have handed over for civil
use since 1978 include 100 airports, 20 harbors, more than 300
railway lines, nearly a hundred telecommunication lines, over one
thousand warehouses, and more than a hundred petroleum sites.
</P>
<P>
A number of enterprises involved in arms manufacture have also
turned to producing civilian goods; for example the total output
value of the Changhong Group, a former arms firm, in Mianyang City
of Sichuan Province exceeded 18 billion yuan (2.2 billion
U.S.dollars) in 1997, while the combined output value of all arms
manufacturers in 1979 was only a little over 200 million yuan (24
million U.S.dollars).
</P>
<P>
And many reckon the army worked a miracle by helping to lay
telecommunication cable lines between Golmud, in northwestern
China's Qinghai Province and Lhasa, the capital of the Tibet
Autonomous Region. It was nick-named the 'area of death' because
of the natural hazards facing the construction workers especially
as much of it is over 4,000 meters above sea level.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, the armed forces have spent
altogether more than 400 million workdays on the construction of
4,000 kilometers of railway lines, over 200 bridges, more than 40
airports both for civil and military use, over 50 harbors, 20,000
kilometers of telecommunication cable lines, and more than 100
large water conservation projects.
</P>
<P>
They have also won much praise for rescuing more than 10
million people in something like 10,000 incidents of natural
disasters since the implementation of the reform and opening up
policy.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, 50,000 troops were sent to tackle the huge forest fire
in the Greater Xing'an mountains in northeastern China, a task
which went on for nearly a month. In 1991, 170,000 members of the
armed forces were sent to help rescue people and protect
property in the dangerous floods which affected many areas that
year and a record 300,000 troops battled the raging waters in this
year's disastrous summer floods,

<HEADLINE> Lebanese New Government Presents Policy Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's Prime
Minister-Designate Salim Hoss Monday presented a policy statement
to parliament on which his cabinet will obtain the house's
vote of confidence.
</P>
<P>
In his 16-page statement, Hoss highlighted a range of
priorities his newly formed government will deal with in the
future mandate in regard to political reform, economy
reconstruction, social affairs and foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Hoss stressed that his government would maintain the
entwinement of the Syrian and Lebanese tracks in the Middle
East peace process with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Syria, with 40,000 troops stationed as peacekeepers in Lebanon,
is the main power broker in the country.
</P>
<P>
Israel is occupying Syrian Golan Heights it captured from
in the 1967 Middle East war and also carved out a self-declared
security zone in south Lebanon in 1985.
</P>
<P>
The new government will continue supporting Lebanese people's
resistance against Israeli occupation until the Jewish state
withdraws from all its occupied Lebanese and Syrian lands, Hoss
read his statement to the 128-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister-designate also pledged to resolve the
worsening economy by trimming ballooning budget deficit and
reducing huge public debt.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's budget deficit of expenditure in the first 11 months
of 1998 was 41.6 percent, still on the course of an annual target
of 42 percent, but witnessed a record high of 59 percent last year
under the former government.
</P>
<P>
The country's public debt in the same period of this year stood
at about 16 billion U.S. dollars, equaling the gross domestic
product.
</P>
<P>
Hoss put the repatriation of the country's 160,000 refugees who
fled their homes along sectarian lines during the 1975-1990 civil
war as another theme of his policy statement.
</P>
<P>
He also promised to establish a state of institutions and laws
with a freedom of expression and respect and protection of
people's human rights.
</P>
<P>
According to the parliament's procedure, the lawmakers will
study Hoss's policy statement in 48 hours before they decide if
they can give a vote of confidence to the new cabinet on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 69-year-old Hoss was designated by the newly elected
President Emile Lahoud as premier on December 2 to replace his
predecessor Rafik Hariri who refused to remain in office after his
six-year term.
</P>
<P>
As an veteran politician and economist in the country, Hoss
formed a 16-man cabinet with many fresh faces two days after his
nomination.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Leader: UN Security Council Structure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalami Abubakar has urged the United Nations to reflect the
global demand for democracy in the composition and structure of
its Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 1998 annual dinner of the Nigerian Institute
for International Affairs in capital Abuja Saturday night,
Abubakar said that the Security Council is charged primarily with the
responsibility for maintaining global peace and security, This
Day reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
So, he noted, "We have on many occasions drawn attention to
the geo-political imbalance in the composition, decision-making
process and working methods of U.N. organs and agencies."
</P>
<P>
Abubakar stated that it would be wrong and tantamount
to self-deceit for the U.N. to preach the gospel of equity and
democratization to its members while at the same time living
under the illusion that "genuine democratization of the U.N.
system itself is a non-issue".
</P>
<P>
He stressed the expectation that the U.N. Security Council
will continue to play its vital charter role, adding "We are
equally firm in our conviction that Africa requires stronger
representation in this important body."
</P>
<P>
Any further delay in democratizing the U.N. system, can only
give the unfortunate impression that the world organization
functions only as an instrument for the pursuit of the interests
of the great powers in particular, and the developed countries in
general, he added.

<HEADLINE> Bearish Commodity Sentiment Works Against Australian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Bearish sentiment about
commodity prices stripped more than half a U.S. cent off the
Australian dollar Monday but a stronger Japanese yen offered some
support.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said commodity prices were again the story of the day
but a scarcity of volume had helped to stay the fall.
</P>
<P>
Perpetual Funds Management manger Glen Howard said most of the
drop in the local currency occurred on Friday night in offshore
trade and dealers simply carried on selling Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Most of it happened Friday night on commodities collapsing
again which drove the Aussie down to around 62.00 U.S. cents in
New York," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
At the close here the Australian dollar was buying 61.85 U.S.
cents from Friday night's local close of 62.40.
</P>
<P>
In New York on Friday, the Commodity Research Bureau (CRB)
futures price index hit a 21-year low of 190.10 points during
early morning trading and continued falling lower throughout the
day.
</P>
<P>
The CRB is a futures price index that measures 17 commodities'
prices.
</P>
<P>
It is not weighted to Australia's exports and does not include
coal, iron ore and wool but traders follow it as an indicator for
the commodity price-sensitive Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
On the local day the Australian dollar was largely range bound
between 62.02 and 61.73 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
At the close, the domestic currency was buying 71.84 Japanese
yen from 73.11 and 1.0182 German marks from 1.0304.

<HEADLINE> Australian Seminar on China's 20 Years of Reform, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The significance of a crucial
meeting held in China in 1978 would receive far more attention
from Australia now than it did 20 years ago, an Australian
economist and former ambassador to China said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Professor Ross Garnaut told a seminar that the Third Plenary
Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist
Party was "a great event in our region" that has led to China's
fast economic growth at a speed never experienced by other big
countries, including Japan.
</P>
<P>
The meeting in December 1978 marked the beginning of China's
introduction of reform and opening to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
"There was no report on the significance of the meeting in any
Australian newspaper... The 20th anniversary will receive far more
attention", Garnaut, director of the Asia Pacific School of
Economics and Management at the Australian National University
(ANU), said in an opening address to the seminar on the
achievements and prospects of China's economic reform.
</P>
<P>
"Its economy has expanded by five times, and its foreign trade
by twelve. it has greatly increased consumption levels of what had
been about half of the world's people in poverty," said Garnaut,
who was Australia's ambassador to China during 1985-1988.
</P>
<P>
China's economy "now absorbs about half of the direct foreign
investment flows to developing economies... Even greater has been
the transformation of the Chinese mind."
</P>
<P>
During the four-hour seminar, a dozen Australian and Chinese
economists made their presentation on China's agricultural, trade
and labor market reforms and development in those fields.
</P>
<P>
In his concluding speech, Garnaut said there would be more to
talk about when the 40th anniversary of the 1978 meeting is
celebrated.
</P>
<P>
In a recent speech in Melbourne to Australian China Business
Council, Garnaut also talked in detail about the historic meeting,
and predicted that the average growth of the last two decades will
be sustained for several decades more.
</P>
<P>
"It would be a natural and in no way a miraculous outcome if
China is well established as the world's largest economy before
our grandchildren have reached our current age," he said.

<HEADLINE> China's Deficit To Be Contained Within Targets: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- China's execution of its 1998
annual budget has been basically normal, and the deficit will more
than likely be controlled within the targeted limit of 96 billion
yuan ratified by legislation earlier this year, finance minister
Xiang Huaicheng said today.
</P>
<P>
He said that such results are remarkable in a year when the
effects of the Asian financial crisis are becoming graver and
which also saw China suffer severe summer floods that killed
thousands and wrought financial havoc.
</P>
<P>
Xiang made the remark when reporting details of how the budget
was implemented to deputies to the National People's Congress who
are on an organized inspection tour of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the monthly fiscal receipts have been
on a steady rise this year, and he explained that apart from an
increase in value-added and consumption tax, the declining rate of
import tax has been controlled.
</P>
<P>
However, due to efforts to stimulate economic growth and
allocate aid for laid-off workers and disaster-hit areas, the
increase in expenditures has been outpacing revenues, Xiang said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the ratio of loss-making state-owned
enterprises had been reduced so far this year and the losses they
inflicted on the national economy are lower.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that in the first ten months local
administration fees and fines collected amounted to 31.86 billion
yuan, up 28.2 percent from the same time last year; value-added
and consumption tax receipts were 9.3 percent up and uncollected
taxes were at their lowest for a number of years, down to 26.2
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Tax collected by customs offices for the first time in
several years registered an increase due to the government efforts
to combat smuggling, Xiang said.
</P>
<P>
In the first ten months of the year, China's total revenues
reached 744.48 billion yuan (excluding revenues from issuing
bonds), 76.9 percent of the budgetary receipts, which was up 10
percent from the same period in 1997. Total government expenditure
was 746.41 billion yuan, 73 percent of the budgeted total, which
represented a 17.4 percent increase on the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Expenditure was thus 1.92 billion yuan more than revenue,
according to the ministry which, in a bid to ensure that the
deficit falls within budgetary targets, has now requested all
localities and government departments to be more cost conscious and
to restrict their expenditure, wherever possible; apart from that
used for disaster relief.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR to Recount Refugees in Tanzanian Camps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 14 (Xinhua) - Office of The United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) will next month
carry out a census of all refugees in Kigoma camps in western
Tanzania to curb dual registration.
</P>
<P>
Anthony Mogga, Emergency Coordinator with UNHCR-Kogoma Sub
Office, was quoted Monday by local press as saying that dual
registration by some refugees gave wrong data and affected the
allocation of supplies.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Tanzanian Ministry of Home Affairs at
Nyarugusu camp in Kasulu District told the press that 22 refugees
have been caught recently for cheating and were sentenced to
three months jail terms.
</P>
<P>
Charles Nswila said they were smart enough to get repeated
supplies of food, cooking utensils and clothing and bedding from
several camps in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We had to make distribution day uniform, on Wednesdays, for
all camps in the region to avoid having people who shuttle from
one camp to another for more supplies," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, birth rates in various refugee camps in Kigoma
Region are alarmingly increasing, a research conducted by local
press said.
</P>
<P>
"In Nyarugusu, Mtabila, and Myowosi camps which have a total
of some 150,000 refugees, each has an average of 350 children
born every month," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said that the high birth rates resulted from
refugees' reluctance to adopt family planning methods.
</P>
<P>
According to UNHCR rules, children even at infancy stage are
counted as persons, so a big family means a big food share.

<HEADLINE> AmCham Survey Shows Optimistic Long-term View for HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Member companies of the
American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong (AmCham) hold an
optimistic long-term view of Hong Kong despite a gloomy short-term
forecast, according to the AmCham's 1998 Business Outlook survey
released Monday.
</P>
<P>
On Hong Kong's business environment outlook, as many as 87
percent and 98 percent of survey respondents said it would be
"good" or "satisfactory" in 2000 and 2001 respectively, while only
54 percent perceived it would be "good" or "satisfactory" in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, 61 percent and 22 percent said that the economy
would recover within two and three years respectively while only
11 percent said it would recover within one year.
</P>
<P>
However, most of the companies are optimistic about Hong Kong
from the long-term view.
</P>
<P>
Of the 66 percent of companies that have regional headquarters
in Hong Kong, 90 percent said they would retain the regional base
here and almost half said they intended to expand their
operations.
</P>
<P>
Factors cited by AmCham member companies for selecting Hong
Kong as the regional headquarters continue to be geographical
location, communications network, infrastructure, free port status
and taxation while expensive labor, office lease and housing costs
are still Hong Kong's key weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by AC Nielsen, was mailed out to 1,086
corporate representatives and a total of 430 responses were
received between October 23 and November 18, representing a 40
percent response rate.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the survey, AmCham Chairman Jeffrey Muir told
reporters Monday that the results confirm that the extent of the
hardship caused by the Asian financial crisis was underestimated.
</P>
<P>
"Our member companies foresee another year of painful economic
adjustment before the Hong Kong economy starts to turn around," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the outlook for China's mainland, the survey said 91
percent of survey respondents believe the outlook for the
business climate over the next five years will be positive. The
survey results suggest this trend is likely to continue.

<HEADLINE> Rate of Various Crimes Increases Rapidly in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Indian Home Minister L.K.
Advani said Monday that various crimes have increased rapidly in
the past 25 years in the country and organized crimes have covered
a wide range of activities.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating an international seminar here on crime prevention
and control strategies against organized crimes, Advani said that
during the past 25 years, incidents of rape had increased by a
whopping 496 percent, counterfeiting by 330 percent, murder by 132
percent and kidnapping and abduction by 116 percent.
</P>
<P>
Organized crimes had covered contract killings, real estate
sharking, arms and drug smuggling, bank frauds and cyber crimes,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Organized crimes emerging today required multi-pronged
strategies for its prevention and control, he said, adding apart
from police and criminal justice system, government agencies such
as income tax, customs, excise and foreign exchange regulation
authorities needed to respond to the challenges.
</P>
<P>
The emerging trend of transnational linkages between criminal
syndicates across the countries throws up the need for
international cooperation and mutual assistance between nations,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Standard Chartered Bank to Operate in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The London-based international
bank of the Standard Chartered Bank is scheduled to begin
operation in Nigeria in January 1999, bringing to three the
number of large trans-national banks in the country.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources disclosed that all the necessary papers for
the commencement of operations by the bank had been obtained and
the bank would begin operation next January, The Post Express
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Citibank of America blazed the trail of operation in the
West African country about two years ago while Bank of Tokyo,
Mitsubishi Limited, Japan's second largest commercial bank, has
made arrangements for its operation in the country earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
The performance of Citibank of Nigeria which posted more than
one billion Naira (about 11.6 million Dollars) profit in 1997 is
a pointer to the high profitability of the country's market for
banks, according to bank sources.
</P>
<P>
They said that the coming of the bank from the United Kingdom
which until recently was a champion of sanctions against Nigeria
was a good indication that international investors may be warming
up to the most populous African country.
</P>
<P>
The Standard Chartered Bank which has an asset valued at over
80 billion Dollars has a large portfolio of business in the
throbbing markets of Hongkong and Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believed that with the troubles in the Asian
financial system, more banks and other financial institutions may
be seeking safe berths in some emerging African markets.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Euro to Benefit Chinese Economy in Long Run (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The formal launch of the Euro
on New Year's Day 1999 will benefit China's economic development
in the long run despite possible challenges in the early
stages, Chinese economists predict.
</P>
<P>
The new currency will help increase exports to Europe,
encourage more European investment in China and improve China's
foreign currency reserve structure but not increase its foreign
debt, they say.
</P>
<P>
Generally the economists agree that the launch of the Euro will
have a significant influence on China since the constructive
partnership between China and the European Union has been
constantly strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Trade volume between China and the EU has witnessed a sharp
increase this year when China's trade with its neighboring nations
has been on the decline due to the Asian financial crisis. China's
exports to the EU accounted for 13 percent of its total
last year, and the figure for 1998 is expected to grow to 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the EU is China's largest importer of
technology. Direct investment from the EU accounts for nine
percent of the overall total, and 19 percent of China's foreign
currency reserves and six percent of its foreign debt balance are
held in European currencies.
</P>
<P>
"With the launch of Euro, the instability of exchange rates
within the Euro zone will gradually shrink to zero," said Zhu Min,
director of the Institute of International Finance under the Bank
of China, in a seminar on the Euro held in Beijing last
week. "That will reduce the cost of trans-national deals
and it will be much easier for China to enter one unified EU
market instead of the 15 it faced in the past." he said.
</P>
<P>
The director said that China's exports to the Euro zone will
increase in the long run although Chinese exporters may face much
fiercer competition from within the zone and possible new
protectionism in the early stage.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Euro to Benefit Chinese Economy in Long Run (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Meanwhile, Qiu Yunlun, director of the Institute of Europe
Studies under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), said
the launch of the Euro will help restructure foreign investment in
China.
</P>
<P>
"An integrated EU market will provide more fund-raising
opportunities for Chinese companies and financial
institutions. The cost of bond-issuing may also be lower as the
European Central Bank will adopt a lower-interest rate policy,"
Qiu said.
</P>
<P>
Currently China's largest preferential loan provider, the EU is
responsible for 44 percent of China's overall foreign government
loans. "Those sort of loans may increase as a result of the launch
of the Euro," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, much of China's foreign debts in European
currencies will, during the transitional period following the
introduction of the Euro, be converted into the new currency. But
that will not mean China's foreign debts will increase since the
majority are held in Deutsch Marks, a currency reckoned to be
stronger than the planned Euro.
</P>
<P>
In the long run, China's debts held in Japanese yen and US
dollars may witness a "decrease" due to the possibility of a
revaluation of the Euro.
</P>
<P>
For Chinese banks, the introduction of the Euro will mean an
additional on-cost due to necessary changes in equipment, updating
computer programs and clearing and accounting systems as well as
changes in statistics and taxation, banking experts believe.
</P>
<P>
The banks' assets and debts held in European currencies will
also be affected.
</P>
<P>
In addition, German style banks who provide a wide range of
banking, insurance and securities services are expected to boom
after the inauguration of the Euro and this will mean stronger
international competition for Chinese banks operating
globally.

<HEADLINE> Leaked Oil Polluting Rivers in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Leaked crude oil from
the Tanzania-Zambia Pipeline, which burst last month, has been
polluting rivers and streams in Morogoro and Iringa regions in
central Tanzania, media reports here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The oil, which is still leaking, has posed health threats to
people draw water for irrigation and domestic uses in Ruaha
Mbuyuni in Iringa Region and Mbigiri in Morogoro Region.
</P>
<P>
The oil is leaking from the crucial pipeline at a speed of
three to four cubic meters per second, The African quoted the
Rufiji Basin Development Authority (RUBADA) official, Willie
Mwaluvanda, as saying.
</P>

<HEADLINE> New Telecommunications Policy Issued in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
issued a National Policy on Telecommunications in a bid to boost
the development of the sub-sector for the next two decades.
</P>
<P>
The objectives of the policy include setting of strategies and
guidelines for the modernization, and expansion and improvement
of telecommunications networks and services, The Guardian
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under the policy, Nigeria will design and implement network
development projects which will yield a minimum of two million
telephone lines and associated facilities to achieve a
teledensity of 1.5 lines to 100 persons by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's current teledensity status stands at 0.74 lines to
100 persons, less than 1:100 ratio minimum recommendation of the
International Telecommunists Union.
</P>
<P>
The policy calls for the establishment of a National Frequency
Management Advisory Board as an arm of the Ministry of
Communications for the planning, coordination, allocation,
assignment, registration and monitoring of the radio frequency
spectrum.
</P>
<P>
A Telecommunications Development Fund will be set up to
provide financial support to telecommunications projects while a
National Institute of Telecommunications will be formed in order
to establish indigenous expertise in telecommunications in the
country.
</P>
<P>
A minimum yearly growth rate of 13.5 percent is envisaged in
the policy for service provision in the rural and urban areas
within the purview of network development.
</P>
<P>
And 10 percent of rural communities are serviced in the
short-term, 30 percent in the medium-term and 60 percent in the
long-term.
</P>
<P>
The policy document is a product of over a decade of tinkering
by telecoms experts, consultants and practioners in the West
African country, according to media reports.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Leaders Hope for Cambodia Membership in ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese Communist Party and
government leaders Monday expressed the hope that Cambodia would
join the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) at the
ASEAN summit to be held here Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meeting separately with Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen here,
both General-Secretary Le Kha Phieu of the Central Committee of
the Vietnamese Communist Party and Vietnamese President Tran Duc
Luong said it is time for Cambodia to join the now nine-member
regional grouping, thus realizing the ASEAN founding fathers'
dream of ASEAN 10.
</P>
<P>
General-Secretary Phieu believed that Cambodia's admission into
ASEAN would "contribute to the strengthening of regional peace and
expansion of cooperation among countries in the region," the
Vietnam News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen, who arrived here Sunday for a two-day visit to
Vietnam, would stay on for the Sixth ASEAN Summit no matter what
decision is made on his country's membership, according to
Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam.
</P>
<P>
So far, the ASEAN members -- Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam -- have
failed to reach consensus on the matter, which will be taken up by
the heads of state and government at their meeting in the next two
days.
</P>
<P>
Some members believe that Cambodia should be admitted because a
new government is already in place in that country. But others,
such as Thailand and Singapore, maintain that more time is needed
to see how stable the political situation there will be.
</P>
<P>
And they also call for the amendment of the Cambodian
Constitution and the appointment of senators to complete a package
of conditions which they said have been set for the admission.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam, the host of the summit, has been pushing for
Cambodia's accession.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's membership "will contribute to peace, cooperation
and development in Southeast Asia," President Luong said while
meeting with Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is the first country Hun Sen has visited since he
became his country's sole prime minister at the end of November.
</P>
<P>
General-Secretary Phieu and President Luong both pledged to
strengthen the relationship and increase cooperation with Cambodia
and said the establishment of the new coalition government in the
country will be conducive to a neutral, peaceful and stable
Cambodia friendly to neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed two agreements on cooperation in
waterways transportation and tourism after Hun Sen's arrival
Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Leaders of ASEAN Members Arrive in Hanoi for Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the nine members of
the Association of Southeast Asians Nations (ASEAN) have arrived
here for a summit that begins on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Those who arrived in the Vietnamese capital on Monday are
Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, Myanmar's Prime Minister Than
Shwe, Thailand's Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, Malaysia's Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad, Philippine President Joseph Estrada,
Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and Indonesian President
B.J. Habibie.
</P>
<P>
Lao Prime Minister Sisavat Keobounphanh arrived here on Sunday.
Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen also flew in on Sunday morning
for a two-day visit to Vietnam, where he is widely expected to
seek Cambodia's entry into ASEAN during the summit.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that leaders of the ASEAN members will discuss
Cambodia's admission to the regional grouping at an informal
dinner hosted by Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai Monday
evening.
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai met separately with Hun Sen
and Khai Monday afternoon. During the meetings, Chuan reaffirmed
his country's wish that Cambodia be admitted into ASEAN, but he
said that the timing of Cambodia's entry is not mature now, Thai
government spokesman Akapol Sorasuchat told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Chuan said that the Thai government had expressed the hope
early in 1995 at the Fifth ASEAN Summit that Cambodian would join
ASEAN as early as possible to fulfill ASEAN founding fathers'
dream of "ASEAN-10." He said the present question is only the
"timing and procedures," according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said that Thai prime minister expressed the hope that ASEAN
foreign ministers, who reached no consensus on the timing of
Cambodia's accession during their preparatory meeting on Saturday
and Sunday for the Sixth ASEAN Summit, will continue their
consultations and put forth their proposals to their leaders for
consideration.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three decades of development, ASEAN's principle
has been consensus through consultation, the spokesman said,
adding that the Thai government hopes that ASEAN member countries
will reach consensus on Cambodia's entry as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia was supposed to join ASEAN together with Laos and
Myanmar in July last year, but its entry was postponed after the
outbreak of armed conflicts between the forces of the then
Cambodian First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh and Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen, which resulted in Ranariddh's ouster.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN, founded in August 1967, now groups Brunei, Indonesia,
Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Koji Ito Becomes Asia's Fastest Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Koji Ito won an
eye-poping men's 100 meters sprint with a fabulous time of 10.05
seconds to become the fastest human in Asia here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Koji, who set a new Asian record of 10.00 in Sunday's
semi-finals, bolted off from the block to take the win with a
clear leading margin.
</P>
<P>
His compatriot Otsuki Yasukatsu and Thailand's Reanchai
Seeharwong crossed the finish line shoulder by shoulder and
clocked the same time of 10.31.
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps I failed to live up to people's expectation to run
under 10 seconds, but I hope I had excited every one," Koji said.
</P>
<P>
Asian record holder Li Xuemei of China became the fastest woman
of Asia after overcoming a fever and stomach problem to win the
women's 100 meters in 11.05.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old, who holds the Asian record of 10.79, met no
fierce challenge since the withdrawal of Sri Lanka's S. Jayasinghe
made the race Li's sole show.
</P>
<P>
Her teammate Li Yali finished second in 11.36 and Mistry
Rachita of India third in 11.41.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not satisfied with my time," Li said. "I felt too tired
since I ran a fever as high as 39 centigrade yesterday. I failed
to go to sleep last night.
</P>
<P>
"I also had a stomach problem," she said. "My coach let me
drink more water and make more sweat. I was not allowed to take
any medicine to ensure there will be no problem in the drug test.
</P>
<P>
"I will not predict how I will run in the World Championships
next year or the Olympic Games because it's still too far from
me."
</P>
<P>
R. Tillekeratne won the second Asian Games gold medal for Sri
Lanka in 24 years in the men's 400 meters, just 10 minutes after
compatriot K.D. Darsha took the first in the same event of the
women's.
</P>
<P>
Tillekeratne was timed at 44.99 for the win, followed by
Qatar's Ibrahim Faraj in 45.32 and Paramjit Singh of India in
45.39.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old, gold medalist in the event at the Asian
Championships last July in Japan, appeared too exhausted to stand
and could not say a word after the race.
</P>
<P>
The gold was also the first in 24 years for Sri Lanka's men
athletes in the Asian Games since Darsha's coach Sunil Gunawardena
and his teammates managed the 4x400m relay in the 1974 Games.
</P>
<P>
Ranjit L. Weerasena, former president of the Sri Lankan Olympic
Committee, said: "I feel great. The secret of their success was
well training."
</P>
<P>
Weerasena said this was only the start for their athletes to
display good performance in the world sports arena.
</P>
<P>
"I belive they will have great world-class performance in the
future. And it will come soon," he said.
</P>
<P>
Darsha, gold medalist in the 400m at the Asian Athletics
Championships, won the event again in 51.37.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yuxiang of China, fourth placer in the Asian
Championships, finished second in 52.50, followed by Kazakhstan's
S. Bodritskaya, silver medalist in the Asian championships.
</P>
<P>
Darsha, 25, pushed her way clear in the second bend, leading
the field of eight runners to cross the finish line.
</P>
<P>
"I felt extremely happy because it was the first gold medal for
Sri Lanka in 24 years," she said.
</P>
<P>
And the win was of special significance since it was her coach
Gunawardena who captured the gold 24 years ago.
</P>
<P>
P.T. Usha, the sprint queen of India who won the bronze in the
event at the Asian Championships, came a distance sixth and said
it might be the last individual 400m race.
</P>
<P>
"I have not trained for 20 days after suffering an leg injury,"
the 39-year-old said.
</P>
<P>
Darsha said she did not pay any attention to Usha because she
only aimed at beating Chinese rivals.
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps she (Usha) was very old and she has been in the
competition for so many years."
</P>
<P>
In the day's first event, Liu Hongyu of China won the title of
the women's 10 kilometers walking.
</P>
<P>
Liu, fourth placer in the event at last year's World Athletics
Championships in Athens, clocked 43 minutes 57.28 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Misumoi Yuka finished second in 44:29.82 and Svetlana
Tolstaya of Kazakhstan third in 45:29.95.
</P>
<P>
The women's heptathlon gold went to China's Shen Shengfei with
a total of 5,817 points. Kazakhstan's Kazanina Svetlana finished
second in 5,775 and Ma Chun-ping of Chinese Taipei third in 5,659.
</P>
<P>
Lee Yong-Sun of South Korea took the women's javelin gold in
62.09 meters, beating China's Liang Lili and Gurmeet Kaur of India
to second and third places.
</P>
<P>
The women's 1,500m title was clinched by India's Jyotirmoy
Sikdhar in 4:12.82 while the men's went to Qatar's Taib Mohd in
3:04.03.
</P>
<P>
Kawakami Yuko won the day's second gold for Japan by taking the
women's 10,000 meters in 31:01.25. Zheng Guixia of China wound up
second in 32:18.81 and another Japanese Takahashi Chiemi third in
32:20.69.

<HEADLINE> mee121408hke - Top Jordanian Tobacco Maker Arrested on Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Ali Sa'd, former chairman of the
board of directors of Jordan Tobacco and Cigarrettes Company has
been arrested on corruption charges, a local newspaper Jordan
Times reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ali Sa'd was arrested last Saturday along with his 12
colleagues including production manager Mohammad Abu Heija. They
have been charged with embezzlement of some 15 million Jordanian
dinars (about 21.1 million U. S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The semi-official newspaper quoted an unnamed official as
saying their embezzlement was discovered by an auditor who was
appointed by a special committee to look after the financially
troubled company in early December.
</P>
<P>
The auditor examined the company's records and submitted his
final report to the new management, which passed on the
report to the Prosecutor General.
</P>
<P>
Further investigations are under way.
</P>
<P>
The Arab Bank, the major creditor of the company, had
filed a court case against the company earlier this year for
allegedly defaulting on a 5.5-million-Jordanian-dinar (some 7.78
million dollars) debt.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Industry and Trade dissolved the company's
board of directors and appointed the special committee to
manage the tobacco company after the Arab Bank moved against
it.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices in Tokyo fell
sharply Monday on growing concern about credit risks stirred by
the temporary nationalization of Nippon Credit Bank (NCB).
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 294.02 points, or 2.04
percent, from last Friday's close to end at 14,111.62.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX) covering all First Section
issues declined 17.85 points, or 1.60 percent, to 1,100.31.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section thinned to an estimated 320
million shares from Friday's 787.30 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Sakura Bank was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Bank shares faced selling pressure, partly because investors do
not believe the disclosed management situations at various banks
following the NCB issue, a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
Export-oriented blue chips were also hammered by Friday's fall
on Wall Street and the yen's rise against the U.S. dollar, traders
said.

<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, losers outnumbered
gainers 872 to 295, with 147 issues ending unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Starts Landmark Visit to Palestinian Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gaza (Palestine), December 14 (Xinhua) -- Palestinians rolled
out red-carpet Monday for U.S. President Bill Clinton as he
arrived here for a one-day visit to Gaza, the first-ever visit to
the Palestinian areas by a sitting U.S. president.
</P>
<P>
Many Palestinians view the foot-setting by the U.S. president
on the Palestinian territories as a symbol of an indirect
U.S. recognition of the Palestinian aspiration for an independent
state.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat
warmly welcomed Clinton on the unblemished runway after his Marine
One landed at the newly-opened airport, which was decorated by a
blizzard of American and Palestinian flags.
</P>
<P>
The national anthems of both the U.S. and Palestine were played
by an guard of honor.
</P>
<P>
After private talks at the VIP lounge in the main building,
Arafat and Clinton cut red ribbons at a ceremony officially
inaugurating the airport, which opened last month as a fruit of
the recent land-for-peace deal with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the airport is valued by Palestinians as a
breakthrough in the development of the Gaza Strip, which is
isolated by electronic wire fences and checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
By opening a new gateway to the outside world, the Palestinians
said, they have moved a big step toward an independent state.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will hold talks with Arafat later in Gaza City,
headquarters of the PNA, and address a meeting of Palestinian
National Council, the Palestinian parliament, which convenes to
reaffirm the nullification of provisions in the Palestinian
charter calling for the destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived in Israel at mid-night Saturday to start his
three-day visit to Israel and the Palestinian areas, which was
intended to shore up the peace process stalled again recently.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians have resumed recriminations in
the last few days over the delay of the implementation of the
peace accords, with each side accusing the other of failing to
fulfill its commitments.
</P>
<P>
Clinton appealed to the two sides Sunday to respect the peace
accords, under which Israel will hand over 13 percent of the West
Bank to the Palestinians in exchange for specific Palestinian
measures on fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli media reported Monday that Clinton will possibly
propose a two-week time-out for the implementation of the
agreement during his talks with Arafat to give the two sides
more time to smooth over their disputes.

MANILA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada has ordered the release of half of the withheld internal
revenue allotments for 1998 to local government units, the
Philippines News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"There is need to release additional funds to local government
units for vital projects and expenditures," the agency quoted
Estrada as saying in an administrative order.
</P>
<P>
He ordered the release of the funds to the local government
units before Christmas Day this year.
</P>
<P>
Last August, Estrada assured officials of the League of
Municipalities of the Philippines that local government units will
have their internal revenue allotments back.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with them, he told local executives that their
internal revenue allotments share will go up from 77.5 billion
pesos (1.9 billion U.S. dollars) this year to 103.8 billion pesos
(2.6 billion U.S. dollars) under the proposed 1999 General
Appropriation Act he had submitted for congressional approval.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's 1999 Trade Surplus Projected at $25 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 14 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's trade surplus will
be 25 billion U.S. dollars in 1999 as the Japanese yen maintains
strength and the Asian market moves toward recovery, said
Commerce, Industry and Energy Minister Park Tae-young on Monday.
</P>
<P>
There are many positive factors that will help increase South
Korea's exports next year, including the reduction in the prices
of basic industrial materials, Park said on television.
</P>
<P>
By restructuring the economy, he said, the export industry
"will recover its competitiveness and domestic consumption will
similarly improve and it will also mean higher import."
</P>
<P>
Park said the country's exports will be up 1.4 percent to 135
billion dollars next year while imports rise by 18.3 percent to
110 billion dollars, resulting in a surplus of 25 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The surplus is projected to be 40 billion dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Park expected foreign direct investments in South Korea to
increase by 40 percent to 12 billion dollars next year as a result
of concerted efforts by the government and private businesses.
</P>
<P>
Foreign direct investment is expected to mount to 8.5 billion
dollars this year.

<HEADLINE> Congo (K) Peace Talks Canceled for Doomed End: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The Lusaka peace summit on
the Congo (K) crisis, which was scheduled for this Tuesday, has
been canceled because it will be useless without participation of
the rebels fighting to topple President Laurent Kabila, a senior
Ugandan official has said.
</P>
<P>
Amama Mbabazi, State Minister for Regional Cooperation, said
over the weekend that the summit was called off because it was
meaningless to have talks that exclude the rebels who occupy
nearly half of the country, the New Vision reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has been leading in that position, and South Africa too
supports the view that rebels be included in the talks, the
minister was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
S. African President Nelson Mandela told Zambian Presidential
Affairs Minister Eric Silwamba last Friday that he saw no point
in talks without the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Several regional summits, held since the crisis erupted in
Congo (K) on August 2, ended fruitless due to absence of rebel
representatives at the meetings. This is the first summit
canceled for this reason.

In doing so, South Africa will join 148 other member states of

The convention was specifically formulated to deal with the
growing problem of international drug trafficking.

In recent years, South Africa has become a transit route for
illicit drug-trafficking.
</P>
<P>
By implementing the convention, South Africa will play a
meaningful role by cooperating with the international community
to combat illicit drug trafficking, as well as ensuring that the
overflow of drugs destined for consumption elsewhere do not enter
its borders, South African Foreign Ministry officials said.
</P>

The departments of Justice, Finance, and Customs and Excise,

<HEADLINE> China Offers Reference Prices for Housing Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- A senior Construction
Ministry official said here today that China has offered a price
package for housing in different parts of the country in a bid to
increase housing sales as part of the new housing reform plan.
</P>
<P>
Low-, medium-, and high-price levels have been set for housing
in cities which are divided into four categories according to
their levels of economic development and the income of local
residents, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The first group consists of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and
Shenzhen, the four economic centers where housing is charged for
1,500 to 2,500 yuan per square meter at the cheap level, above
4,000 yuan at the medium one, and 8,000 to 10,000 yuan for the
high grade.
</P>
<P>
The second group is composed of regional economic centers,
including Tianjin, Hangzhou, Chongqing, Dalian, Wuhan and
Qingdao, where housing prices range from 1,200 yuan to 8,000 yuan
per square meter.
</P>
<P>
Cities of the third category are capitals of other provinces
and autonomous regions, such as Chengdu, Lanzhou, and Changsha,
and the housing prices are set at between 800 and 4,000 yuan per
square meter.
</P>
<P>
The fourth group is composed of medium-size and small cities,
where housing sells at 800-1,200 yuan per square meter.
</P>
<P>
China's housing reform plan is aimed to commercialize housing
by converting government welfare funds into housing subsidies,
which will become part of salaries, so that government and
enterprise staff members can afford to buy or rent housing at
their own expense.

<P>
BANGKOK, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Taipei's Chen Keng
Hsien gave his coach Yang Tung Tseng the best birthday present in
his life -- a bronze medal at the Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
"We have been waiting for this medal for 20 years," said Yang,
who turns 33 on Monday. "We have never won any Games medal in this
event."
</P>
<P>
"This is the best birthday present I have received in my life."
</P>
<P>
Chen, a 20-year-old junior, finished third in the men's 1-km
time trial behind winner South Korea's Ji Sung-Hwan and runner-up
Japanese Takanobu Jumonji.
</P>
<P>
"He was only 140 centimeters tall when I began to coach him at
Kaosiung," added Yang, who had been a teacher at Chen's middle
school. "Now you can see he is a grown man.
</P>
<P>
"He could have rode faster if he had not been so nervous. He
led the first lap and if he could keep that speed, a silver is
possible."
</P>
<P>
Yang was apparently proud of the fact that more than half of
Chinese Taipei's riders here have trained under his guidance.
</P>
<P>
"Five out of the nine here graduated from the middle school I
had been at," he added.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Taipei is aiming at two bronzes here and Chen's
performance is a good start, he added.

BANGKOK -- The control tower failed to give proper guidance
when the ill-fated flight 261 of the Thai Airways International
was attempting to land in a tropical storm, aviation sources said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Probing the cause of the air crash at Surat Thani airport in
southern Thailand last Friday, investigators blamed the control
tower at the airport for removing a landing system which would
allow aircraft to touch down safely in bad weather six months
before the crash. The flight, Airbus A310-200, made two failed
attempts to land at the airport before coming in for the third
fatal approach. A total of 101 people on board were killed and 45
others injured, some of them seriously. (Thailand-Crash-Control

"In the first stage we expect to have 40,000 trained civilians

processing and training civilian militia. (Indonesia-Militia)

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Wins Women's 400m at Asian Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 14 (Xinhua) -- D. Damayanthi Darsha claimed
the first gold at the Asian Games for Sri Lanka in 24 years by
taking the women's 400 meters here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Darsha, gold medalist in the event at the Asian Athletics
Championships last July in Japan, clocked 51.57 seconds for the
gold.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yuxiang of China, four placer in the Asian championships,
finished second in 52.50, followed by Kazakhstan's S. Bodritskaya,
silver medalist in the Asian championships.
</P>
<P>
Darsha, 25, pushed her way clear in the second bend, leading
the field of eight runners to cross the finish line.
</P>
<P>
"I felt extremely happy because it was the first gold medal for
Sri Lanka in 24 years," she said.
</P>
<P>
And the win was of special significance since it was her coach
Sunil Gunawardena who captured the gold 24 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"My coach won the gold medal in the men's 4x400m relay in
1974," she said.
</P>
<P>
P.T. Usha, the sprint queen of India who won the bronze in the
event at the Asian championships, came a distance sixth and said
it might be the last individual 400m race.
</P>
<P>
"I have not trained for 20 days after suffering a leg injury,"
the 39-year-old said.
</P>
<P>
Darsha said she did not pay any attention to Usha because she
only aimed to beat the Chinese rivals.
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps she (Usha) was very old and she has been in the
competition for so many years."

<HEADLINE> Economic Cooperation in Cyprus Under Discussion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Possibilities of economic
cooperation on the divided island of Cyprus dominated a meeting of
Turkish, Greek, Greek Cypriot and Turkish businessmen which
started in Istanbul on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, a second one of its kind held in Turkey in the
past 35 years, was organized by Columbia University's
International Conflict Resolution Program and the International
Peace Research Institute of Oslo.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton's Special Representative Richard
Holbrooke led off the two-day door-closed meeting, which was
intended to encourage cooperation between Turkish and Greek
Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources disclosed that Turkey's Enka Holding Chairman
Sarik Tara proposed at the meeting that a pipeline be built to
transport drinking water to the two communities on the Cyprus
island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus delegation chairman Constantinos Lordos said that "this
proposal merits consideration and it is encouraging."
</P>
<P>
The pipeline, which will run from the Manavgat River in
Turkey's Mediterranean Antalya province to northern Cyprus and
provide drinking water to the water-starved island.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots stressed that economic ties between the two
communities on the island can only be restored if the
Greek Cypriots end a trade embargo against northern Cyprus,
which controls almost 40 percent of the island.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared the founding of "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" in 1983 which is only recognized by
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus was divided into the Greek-Cypriot dominated south and
the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops took over the northern third of the island in response to
a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Tension between the governments of Turkey and Cyprus has grown
noticeably since Cyprus announced that she was purchasing S-300
ground-to-air missiles from Russia. Turkey has threatened to take
out the missiles if they are deployed on the island.

SHENZHEN, December 14 (Xinhua) --Mongolian President Nachagyn
Bagbandy left Shenzhen, a special economic zone in Guangdong
Province, for Huhhot, capital of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region,
this afternoon after winding up a three-day visit here.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen Mayor Li Zibin met with Bagbandy and his party
yesterday evening, and briefed the visitors on the city's economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Bagbandy believes that Shenzhen's growth from a small town into
a beautiful city represents a great success. Learning more about
it, especially as it spearheads China's ongoing reform and opening
up, could be of huge benefit to Mongolia which is also undergoing
similar changes, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that Mongolia, which is rich in natural
resources, may establish good ties of cooperation with Shenzhen,
which boasts advanced industrial technology and large amounts of
funds.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- One Ugandan major general who
is under investigations for buying Uganda Commercial Bank (UCB),
the country's biggest commercial bank, has been in a big beef
deal with Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Salim Saleh, former senior presidential advisor on defense and
security, and also President's Yoweri Museveni's brother, will
sign the multimillion-U.S. Dollar contract very soon, the New
Vision paper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the general as saying Sunday that he is in
advanced stages of negotiating a contract to supply beef worth 10
million Dollars to Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The deal is currently handled by Divinity Union Ltd, a company
the major general set up recently.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, an economic embargo was imposed on Burundi in
the wake of a military coup. Last Month, the U.N. Security
Council urged Burundi neighbors to end the sanctions, a move
criticized by Burundi political parties that want democracy restored in
the country rocked by violence.
</P>
<P>
Saleh, who admitted a week ago that he bought UCB
fraudulently, is now under a police probe of his illegal
involvement in the UCB purchase.

Asian Games gold medal for Sri Lanka in 24 years in the men's 400
meters, just 10 minutes after compatriot K.D. Darsha took the
first in the same event of the women's.
</P>
<P>
Tillekeratne was timed at 44.99 seconds for the win, followed
by Qatar's Ibrahim Faraj in 45.32 and Paramjit Singh of India in

<P>
The 25-year-old, gold medalist in the event at the Asian

</P>
<P>
The gold was also the first in 24 years for Sri Lanka's men
athletes in the Asian Games since Darsha's coach Sunil Gunawardena
and his teammates managed the 4x400m relay in the 1974 Games.
</P>
<P>
Ranjit L. Weerasena, former president of the Sri Lankan Olympic
Committee, said: "I feel great. The secret of their success was
well training."

<HEADLINE> Schools Closed Down in Tehran For Air Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Education Department of
Tehran Province has decided to shut down elementary schools in
some major cities of the province Monday due to the serious air
pollution in recent days.
</P>
<P>
The cities are the Iranian capital of Tehran, Shahr Rey and
Shemiranat, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made upon the recommendation of the
Environmental Protection Organization, which has warned of severe
air pollution partly due to the stagnant weather in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The air pollution, which befell Tehran days ago due to the
phenomenon of air reversion in winter, is worsening for lack of
winds and precipitation, plus the pollutants released by the huge
fleet of worn-out automobiles.
</P>
<P>
Ten Tehran citizens, three women and seven men, died Saturday
because of the air pollution, and doctors said that the air
pollution has drastically raised the number of heart attack cases
in the city.
</P>
<P>
Environmental experts have called on the citizens, particularly
the elders and children not to go to downtown Tehran, the most
serious zone of air pollution.
</P>
<P>
They also urged the citizens to use public transportation
services instead of their private cars in order to reduce air
pollution.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports showed that some 4,000 people every year died
of respiratory problems caused, or exacerbated, by pollution and
some 2,000 people die of cancer incurred by health-damaging
substances in the air, such as lead.

LUSAKA, December 14 (Xinhua) --Zambian traditional healers

Monday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Traditional Healers Association president

<HEADLINE> Former Opium War Battlefield Becomes Modern Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Humen, a battlefield during
the 1840-1842 Opium War, has taken on a new look of a modern town
after years of construction.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the small coastal town in south China's Guangdong
province had a revenue of more than 480 million yuan, the highest
among all the towns in China. This year's financial situation is
even better, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
More than 160 years ago, a Chinese official named Lin Zexu
destroyed thousands of cases of opium that had been smuggled into
Humen by British businessmen. The event became an excuse for the
British to launch the first Opium War against China.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure of British troops, the then Chinese
government was forced to open some of the coastal ports and signe
d unequal treaties with the Western powers. Hong Kong was ceded
to the United Kingdom under the treaties.
</P>
<P>
To date, Humen, a close neighbor to Hong Kong and Macao, has
become a prosperous seaside town with high-rise buildings along
its main streets. More than 1,300 export-oriented enterprises and
34 markets have been established for specialized goods including
garments, electrical appliances and fruits. Every year, billions
of yuan worth of products are sold abroad from here.
</P>
<P>
A local official, Li Shixian, said that there used to be only
a few shabby houses in a vast field twenty years ago, and modern
buildings can be seen everywhere now. More than a dozen of hotels
have been built in the small town to cater to a large number of
overseas investors seeking playground here each year.

<HEADLINE> EU Extends Deadline for Trade Accord With S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 14 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU)
leaders meeting in Vienna have extended the deadline for the
conclusion of a free trade agreement with South Africa, Business
Day newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The extension broke a promise by EU leaders to South African
President Mandela that an agreement would be reached by year end.
</P>
<P>
The EU promise was made at an EU summit in Cardiff, Wales, in
June and was repeated by French President Jacques Chirac when he
visited South Africa in late June.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders said in Vienna that if the long-awaited deal
was to be finalized, concessions would have to be made by both
sides. They said they wanted ministers to bring the talks to a
successful conclusion as soon as possible or, at the latest, by
an EU summit scheduled for March.
</P>
<P>
"This will require efforts by both sides," they said.
</P>
<P>
Business Day quoted a senior South African Foreign Ministry
official as saying Sunday night that it appeared some EU members
were still unhappy about deadlock-breaking proposals worked out
by South African Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin and EU
commissioner Joao de Deus Pinheiro.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is on that side, we negotiate as one country."
</P>
<P>
Mandela had earlier sent a letter to the summit, chaired by
Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima, urging a speedy settlement.
</P>
<P>
However, the meeting of the EU's heads of government dealt
with the issue only on the peripheries, concentrating instead on
the proposed expansion of the union.
</P>
<P>
The main remaining sticking point in the talks, launched in
1995, revolved around the use by South African wine producers of
the names of "port" and "sherry" on locally made drinks sold
within South Africa, EU chief negotiator Philip Lowe said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has agreed to stop using the names on the export
market, and Lowe said the EU had now asked it to consider a
generous transition period of about 13 years for changing the
names on domestic markets.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, South Africa had said it was not ready to
concede.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the EU had agreed to allow South Africa
to continue using the names for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Lowe said European Commission President Jacques Santer would
be ready to meet South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki in
seeking a breakthrough.

NAIROBI, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Life expectancy among Kenyans
will be reduced to 42 years by 2010 from currently 58, if the
AIDS scourge is not fought seriously, a UNICEF official warned
here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Unitd Nations Children's Fund representative to Kenya,
Chrispin Wilson, said his organization had declared war on AIDS

<P>
With 80 percent of Kenyans being Christians, Wilson said, the
church must play its part and help eradicate AIDS.
</P>
<P>
He said that in Nyanza Province in southwestern Kenya,
30-35 percent of adults have the HIV virus that cause Aids. Some
villages in the province have been abandoned as the old moving to
safer areas, with the middle-aged group wiped out.
</P>
<P>
He praised Kenyan President Moi's call on everybody to protect
themselves against Aids.
</P>
<P>

diseases, AIDS could be reduced by at least 40 percent in the
eastern African country.

<HEADLINE> Guangxi Becomes China's Major Subtropical Fruit Production Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The production of subtropical
fruits has become a pillar industry of southwest China's Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region and contributed much to the region's
poverty relief efforts and economic development in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Situated in the subtropical zone, Guangxi enjoys good natural
conditions for growing fruits. The fruit planting acreage in
Guangxi is over one million hectares in 1998, 22 times that of
two decades ago. The total output value of the fruit industry rea
ched 8.3 billion yuan in 1997, next only to that of grains and
husbandry.
</P>
<P>
An official from the regional government said that Guangxi has
issued a series of favorable policies to encourage fruit
production. Since 1986, the regional government has invested
about six million yuan annually to promote fruit production.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi has also developed local quality fruits by
establishing 34 production bases for longan, banana, mango, and
litchi in 580,000 hectares of land, accounting for 53.8 percent
of the total fruit planting acreage in Guangxi.
</P>
<P>
Fruit planting has also helped peasants escape poverty.
Gongcheng Yao Autonomous County was formerly one of Guangxi's 49
poverty-stricken counties. It has encouraged peasants to grow
fruits in recent years, and its annual output value of the fruit
industry now stands at over 440 million yuan, making it one of
Guangxi's rich counties.

<HEADLINE> China, EU Join Hands to Solve Island Energy Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and European Union
experts are working to complete the world's first sea wave power
station by the end of this century to help solve the energy
shortage of China's island regions.
</P>
<P>
Italy's Ponte Di Archinede Corp., the major EU partner in the
project, and several Chinese research institutes recently signed
an agreement to build a sea wave power generating system in the
Daishan Area of the Zhoushan Islands in the East Sea.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to cost more than 10 million yuan,
according to sources at the Science and Technology Commission of
Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Marine energy experts from China, Ponte Di Archinede, Italy's
Naples University, and Edingburg University of the United Kingdom
have conducted investigations on the hydrological situation, the
sea bed and climate of the area.
</P>
<P>
The two parts will next focus on designing and building the
model generating unit with a capacity of 150-200 kilowatts,
officials with the provincial commission said. The key parts of
the work will be done by Edingburg University and Harbin
Polytechnic University.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from China's State Administration of Marine Affairs
show the Zhoushan Islands is one of the areas in the world with
the richest sea wave energy.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the administration said that why the EU chose
China as its first target among its eight potential partners
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The administration said the Daishan Area has a water passage
with a speed of four meters per second, and there are more such
passages in other parts of China.
</P>
<P>
In Europe, where sea wave energy is better tapped, the fastest
wave speed is merely 2 meters per second.
</P>
<P>
However, Professor Wang Chuankun of the Second Marine Research
Institute under the administration, said sea wave energy is in
urgent need due to the shortage of other energy resources such as
coal, petroleum and water power in Chinese islands.
</P>
<P>
Of the 433 resident islands of China, a third are not able to
produce power by themselves.
</P>
<P>
Most of the power generating equipment used by the islanders
is small diesel-powered generators, with high costs and short
continuous work span.

<HEADLINE> COMESA to Liberalize Air Travel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 14 (Xinhua) --The Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (COMESA) states will next year liberalize air
travel in the region, Zambian Commerce Minister David Mpamba has
said.
</P>
<P>
Mpamba made the remarks at the closing session of the sixth
meeting of the COMESA council of ministers at the weekend. He
said that the full liberalization of the air transport services
will be implemented in two phases and the first phase is expected
to be completed in October next year, Times of Zambia reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The first phase involves the introduction of the free movement
of intra-COMESA passenger services with a frequency of daily
flights between the capitals of the member states.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral air service agreements will apply in the case of
frequencies beyond two daily flights.
</P>
<P>
During the first phase of air travel liberalization, member
states will be required to effect multiple designation and
elimination of capacity restrictions in the airline industry.
</P>
<P>
The second phase will entail implementation of total free
movement of intra-COMESA air transport services.
</P>
<P>
Only airlines that are substantially owned and effectively
controlled by COMESA member countries will qualify to participate
in the liberalized air services program, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Sell Govt Shares in National Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' Committee on
Privatization Monday confirmed a plan to sell government stakes in
the Philippine National Bank in 1999, the Philippines News Agency
said.
</P>
<P>
The plan would be implemented once the three foreign financial
consultants hired by the government complete the assessment on the
value of the government shares for disposition in the bank, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
But the actual bidding process will be done much earlier than
expected prior to the submission of the plan to the Department of
Finance by the consultants, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the proceeds of the sale will go to the
general funds as part of the government's privatization efforts.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the move is expected to contribute to the development
of the country's capital market.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the proposed disposition of the public shares in the
bank will generate ample fresh funds for the national coffer,
which is needed to fill the budget deficit.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka, Thimpu Seek to Open More Land Transit Routes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi and Bhutanese
businessmen are now giving increasing focus on opening more land
routes between the two countries in a bid to boost trade in the
region, it was learned from the Bhutanese embassy here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The new transit routes would also enable the land-locked Bhutan
to have access to the outside world, including possible use of
Bangladesh's largest seaport of Chittagong, a Bhutanese diplomat
told Xinhua through telephone.
</P>
<P>
At present, Bhutan uses Indian land routes and depends solely
on Calcutta port for its imports and exports.
</P>
<P>
Bhutan has only one land route through Burimari in Lalmanirhat
(Bangladesh) for trade with Bangladesh, and this route is
difficult for Bhutanese cargo as it has to negotiate a long
distance, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Bhutanese government has proposed two new points of land
transit connecting the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Thimpu wants to establish shorter and convenient routes through
the northeastern Indian state of Meghalaya for easy business
transactions between Bangladesh and Bhutan, and the new route, if
opened, will give a big boost to trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
A high-powered Bhutanese team was in Dhaka last May to carry
out a joint survey to identify "feasible routes" connecting the
two countries on the eastern side, he disclosed. On its return,
the team submitted a detailed report for consideration of the
Bangladeshi and Bhutanese governments.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi Ministry of Communications and the Bhutanese
authorities are actively studying the report, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Kingdom of Bhutan, situated on the southern slopes of the
Himalayas, is a land-locked country with a population of about
700,000.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ethnic Folk Songs Welcome Foreign Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- A dozen ethnic groups in south
China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region are finding new words
these days for ancient antiphonal folk songs.
</P>
<P>
One girl sings: "I am in town to find a job. You do farm work
at home. When can the herd-boy see the weaving-girl?"
</P>
<P>
And a boy answers: "I ride a motor to see you in the town,
hundreds of miles are not too long. If you still miss me, tell
your love words on the phone."
</P>
<P>
Ethnic people are good at singing songs depicting their lives
and there are songs for every occasion, from inviting guests to
dinner, seeing lovers, and working in fields to praying to the gods.
</P>
<P>
Their folk singing has a special charm for overseas artists and
tourists who come from Australia, Japan, Russia, America and many
southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, not only Chinese singers, but also many
foreign artists visit Guangxi to collect folk songs. One Japanese
singer said he considered Guangxi "a treasure house of folk songs."
</P>
<P>
Local folks now see people of many skin colors singing on stage
at prominent folk-song competitions, like the largest one, an
annual song competition held in early March of the lunar calendar,
a tradition going back many hundreds of years.

<HEADLINE> Philippine-US Exercise to Resume Upon VFA Ratification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines and the United
States will resume the long-suspended Balikatan military exercise
as soon as the Philippine Senate approves the Visiting Forces
Agreement (VFA), a military spokesman said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Armed Forces Spokesman Gregorio Fajardo told the Philippine
News Agency that preparations are underway for the holding of the
Balikatan exercise, a joint Philippine-U.S. war game which was
suspended two years ago in the absence of the VFA.
</P>
<P>
As a consequence, the U.S. postponed its military exercises
with the Philippines, except for those which involve 20 or less
American personnel and defense officials, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the suspension of the Balikatan
exercise has deprived the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) of
the latest military technology and techniques adopted by the U.S.
forces.
</P>
<P>
AFP Chief of Staff Joselin B. Nazareno returned here Sunday
night from Honululu, where he attended the regular Philippine-U.S.
Mutual Defense Board (MDB) hosted by Gen. Joseph Pruer, commander
in chief of U.S. Forces in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed security matters of mutual concern,
particularly the upcoming Balikatan exercise to be held in the
country once the VFA is ratified by the senate, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines and the United States signed in 1951 the Mutual
Defense Treaty (MDT), under which the U.S. will defend the
Philippines in case it is attacked by foreign forces.
</P>
<P>
The proposed VFA seeks to provide a conducive setting for the
conduct of combined military exercises between the two countries,
according to the Philippine government.

<HEADLINE> No Bigfoot, Say Chinese Wildlife Conservation Officials (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese officials
in charge of wildlife protection denied the existence of the
legendary "wild man" -- the Chinese version of "bigfoot" -- during
an exclusive interview with Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
This is believed to be the first official word on the
long-debated bigfoot myth, which originated in the Shennongjia
primitive forest area of central China's Hubei Province, north of
the Three Gorges.
</P>
<P>
"A number of systematic scientific expeditions have found that
all reported sightings of bigfoot were actually other wild
animals," said Zhang Jianlong, director of the department of
forests and wildlife conservation under the State Administration
of Forestry (SAF).
</P>
<P>
Responding to a recent "offer of 500,000 yuan (some 63,000
U.S. dollars) reward for the capture of one 'bigfoot,'" Zhang said
the government does not support this profit-oriented activity.
</P>
<P>
"Without our permission no one can enter into the Shennongjia
National Natural Reserve, the site of most 'bigfoot' sightings,"
Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
"Encouraging some mass capture of 'bigfoot' will severely hurt
other wildlife, and scientifically will come to nothing," he said.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yongfan, deputy director of the department of forest and
wildlife conservation, said that local natural reserve personnel
have never seen a trace of the alleged "bigfoot" during their many
years of regular field patrols.

<P>
According to Yan Xun, chief of the SAF's natural reserve
management division, the conditions in Shennongjia are unsuited
for sustaining the life of any primate, including the so-called
bigfoot.
</P>
<P>
"There are no basic primate foods such as berries or broad-leaf
trees in the mountains of Shennongjia, where most bigfoot
enthusiasts believe the mysterious creature lives," he said.
</P>
<P>
Officials in the SAF's wildlife management division also doubt
the existence of bigfoot.
</P>
<P>
"I just don't believe the story, and many scientists agree with
me," said division chief Wang, who added that most bigfoot
researchers lack special scientific training.
</P>
<P>
Shennongjia is a 3,253-square-kilometer mountain area covered
by primitive forests. For a long time Chinese legends have told of
a mysterious, human-like creature who roams its valleys.
</P>
<P>
Most people who claim to have seen bigfoot give similar
descriptions of the creature, portraying it as a two-meter-tall
animal with apelike facial features and a body covered with red
hair. It has no tail and usually leaves large footprints in the
fields, they say.
</P>
<P>
There are some Chinese scientists who tend to believe in the
existence of bigfoot, while some hold that bigfoot is actually an
unknown primate; still others argue that what local people have
seen may have been simply bears or monkeys.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Between 3,500 and 5,000 of
New Zealand workers have lost their jobs in forestry and related
sectors in the past 12 months because of the slump in Asian
markets and big company layoffs, the Dominion reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The Asian impact on log exports has led to probably 1,000 bush
 workers laid off in the past 12 months," the Wellington-based
newspaper quoted Jim Jones, national secretary of the Wood
Industries Union of New Zealand, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The slump in log and lumber exports to Asian markets has also
had an impact on jobs in the transport and engineering sectors, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Forests cover about 29 percent or 7.9 million hectares of New
Zealand's land area. Of this, about 6.4 million hectares are in
natural forest and 1.5 million hectares in planted production
forests.
</P>
<P>
Forest products are New Zealand's important earners of overseas
funds. In recent years the average annual exports of forest
products are valued at about 2,600 million NZ dollars (1,375
million U.S. dollars). Japan, Australia and the Republic of Korea
are usually the biggest buyers of New Zealand's forest products.
In 1996, Japan and the Republic of Korea took 44 percent of the
total exports of its forest products.

WELLINGTON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- An Internet
child-pornography investigation by New Zealand authorities has
led to the arrest of 43 people overseas involved in a huge network
of Internet child pornography, according to a local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion reported Monday that a joint investigation

Since then 58 people from Britain, Northern Ireland, the
Netherlands, France, Germany, Canada and the Middle East have been
identified as being involved, with 43 arrests so far. More
arrests are likely.
</P>
<P>
The case against the Auckland man has been completed and
forwarded to the New Zealand attorney-general for approval to
prosecute for the possession and distribution of objectionable
material.
</P>
<P>
According to the Wellington-based newspaper, 45,000 child
safety pamphlets are being printed in New Zealand for the

<HEADLINE> China Must Fully Tap Timber Potential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- China should plant more trees
and make full use of its forest resources to meet the increasing
demand for timber in the future, a forestry expert said here today.
</P>
<P>
The serious flooding on the Yangtze River the past summer
increased Chinese awareness of environmental protection, and
logging in most forests in many provinces has been banned. Newly
planted forest areas will have to take the place of natural
forests and become China's main source of timber, said Zhang
Jiurong, vice-president of the Chinese Academy of Forestry.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that just as with food, China should rely on itself
to meet the growing demand for timber and should not spend large
amounts of foreign exchange to import timber and timber products.
</P>
<P>
China's new forest areas have now reached 34.25 million
hectares, and experts say the country still has about 20 million
hectares of land that can be turned into high-yield timberland.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that China's great potential for forest
production has not been tapped. The world average for timber is
114 cubic meters per hectare, but China's is only 83.6 cubic
meters.
</P>
<P>
"If proper policies are implemented, new technologies
developed and the rich surplus labor force attracted to the field
of tree planting, after 15 to 20 years, new forests can provide
200 million cubic meters of timber annually," said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
He said that China should strengthen the development of
forestry science and technology and focus on genetic research to
separate and clone high quality genes.
</P>
<P>
The country should also develop new wood-based materials, which
can play an important role in the automotive, machinery,
electronics and space industries.
</P>
<P>
China should also develop technologies to economize timber. If
the utilization rate of timber can be increased by 10 percent,
more than 15 million cubic meters of timber can be saved every
year, said Zhang.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand National
Party, the ruling party in the country, finally found small cheer
in the opinion polls Sunday night with the latest One Network

major political rival of the National Party, had dropped three
percentage points in the past month.

The New Zealand Press Association (NZPA) reported Monday that
the poll gave the Labor Party 45 percent support, down from 48
percent a month ago; the National Party 35 percent support, up
one percentage point from the previous poll; the Alliance, an

<HEADLINE> No Meeting on Sunday Between NBA Owners and Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 13 (Xinhua) -- NBA spokesman Brian
McIntyre said there was no meeting on Sunday after a short
negotiating session lasted less than 30 minutes yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting broke off again Saturday after the sides made no
progress in the labor dispute, and the entire season looks
heading to be canceled.
</P>
<P>
"No one knows what their schedule is," said union attorney
Jeffrey Kessler.
</P>
<P>
There was room for a little levity because there still is
enough time to save the season. The top negotiators could decide
to meet this week, or they could decide to put the process back
on the slow track and settle in front of their television sets
Friday to watch exhibition game from Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
"It's very clear we don't have the basis for a deal between
us, or anything even close," Granik said. "It's clear we have
very different ideals of what an appropriate deal should look
like."
</P>
<P>
Sunday, Newsweek reported that some players believe race is
playing a factor in negiotiations. The union's leaders are black
while all the owners and the top two negotiators are while.
</P>
<P>
"I think there is a perception from the owners to even some
fans that we're blacks who should be happy with what we've got,"
said Alonzo Mourning,."There is a lack of respect given us in
large part because we're athletes."
</P>
<P>
But David Stern denied the saying. "This is a collective
brgaining dispute, no more, no less," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Two seven-car subway trains
ordered by Iran have been transported from Changchun, capital of
northeast China's Jilin Province, to Tehran via the port of Dalian.
</P>
<P>
According to a Sino-Iranian 138-million-dollar contract, China
will provide 217 subway cars for a 50-kilometer-long subway
project in Tehran. These two trains represent the first shipment,
with the remainder to be delivered by the first quarter of 2001.
</P>
<P>
The Changchun Passenger Train Plant, the only one in China
mass-producing subway cars, was awarded the contract after
strenuous international competition for the order.
</P>
<P>
In light of environmental and technological requirements for
the Tehran subway, the plant reconfigured the design, and
specifically adopted new materials and technology to ensure the
quality and performance of the cars.
</P>
<P>
The two trains will be put into use in the Tehran subway system
next February after a short trial period.
</P>
<P>
A Tehran Urban and Suburban Railway Company official, who was
here for the first delivery, said they planned to expand the
50-kilometer-long line in the future, and hoped to continue
cooperation with their Chinese partner.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Allow Railway Routes for Int'l Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
decided to allow Bangladesh's railway routes for international
use, including as the Trans-Asian Railway corridors for
integration with the regional and international transport network.
</P>
<P>
Communications Minister Anwar Hussain disclosed this while
addressing a three-day regional seminar on "Railway Wagon
Information and Control System (RailWICS)" in Dhaka Friday, The
Independent daily newspaper said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Simultaneously the BR (Bangladesh Railway) is making endeavors
to introduce information technology and automation process in
various fields for improvement of performance efficiency and
quality of services to the customers," he told the seminar.
</P>
<P>
The RailWICS project, which comprises an online network of 37
computers located at important operating, commercial and
administrative centers throughout the railway system, is being
implemented by the BR with the assistance of the United Nations
Center for Trade and development (UNCTAD).
</P>
<P>
The minister said the wagon and cargo tracking system installed
by the UNCTAD and the United Nations Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) would be a very
useful tool for the BR to improve management efficiency and
customer service.
</P>
<P>
"Globalization of trade is leading to globalization of
transport system as well," he observed. "Nowadays transport
infrastructure of a country is not built or developed for national
consideration alone."
</P>
<P>
The BR was facing a very difficult and challenging task of
balancing its budget on its own but over the few years a series of
reorganization and reform measures were adopted including
rationalization of manpower, he added.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Blocks Economic Recovery: Thai Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Company layoffs and future economic uncertainty would hit
spending, and the agricultural sector was not strong enough to
absorb sacked workers, Chalongphob Susangkarn, president of the
Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI), said in remarks
published by Monday's Bangkok Post.
</P>
<P>
There are approximately 2 million unemployed Thais and the
number could rise to 2.8 million next year.
</P>
<P>
"The expectations of private firms and individual consumers to
spend more of their savings will be hard to realize if people are
not certain of their future," Chalongphob said.
</P>
<P>
He said debt and industrial restructuring and skills training
were crucial if Thailand wanted to see economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
A drop in local spending and massive overcapacity would lead
to zero economic growth next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
But government officials were confident that the Thai economy
would begin to recover in the second half of 1999. A budget
deficit and increased government spending would stimulate local
consumption.
</P>
<P>
"The state contributes only 20 percent to the country's GDP,
therefore, a large part of the effort to salvage the economy still
depends on the private sector," Deputy Finance Minister Pisit
Leeahtam said.
</P>
<P>
Government investment next year is expected to increase
household spending, rather than investment in infrastructure
where money did not go directly to the people. The appreciation of
the baht would improve company values, especially the debt to
equity ratio.
</P>
<P>
"Declining debt will make it easier for good companies to
raise funds or find new partners to strengthen their businesses,"
Pisit said.
</P>
<P>
Although it is too early to say if Thailand is on the path to
recovery, the TDRI sees the Thai economy picking up in the second
half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The economy will not rapidly recover. Companies will embark on
debt restructuring or find business partners. But we do not want
to see a hiccup in production affecting many workers," Chalongphob
said.
</P>
<P>
Niphon Puaponggsakorn, an economist from Thammasat University,
said Thailand was not yet out of hot water. A stronger baht could
be a false signal. He said the surplus current account was due to
a drop in imports and dwindling consumption at home.
</P>
<P>
He said chronic problems with the Thai economy, such as
management incompetence and the competitiveness of industry, had
not been addressed. Such problems would continue when the economy
picked up.
</P>
<P>
Chalongphob suggested the state pay more attention to forward
planning using financial statistics and companies to do more to
build up useful data.

<HEADLINE> Insurance Bill to Be Tabled to Indian Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The much-awaited Insurance
Regulatory Authority of India (IRAI) Bill is expected to be tabled
to the ongoing Lower House of Parliament Monday for debate and
approval.
</P>
<P>
The controversial bill was earlier scheduled to be tabled
before the House last week. Its introduction, however, was delayed
after Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee faced a virtual revolt
by his own ruling BJP members over the cabinet decision to permit
foreign equity in the sector.
</P>
<P>
As part of the process of liberalizing the sector, the
government has also decided that all private insurance companies
allowed to operate in the country must reinsure part of their risk
with the General Insurance Corporation (GIC) once the latter is
granted the status of national reinsurer.
</P>
<P>
The IRAI Bill seeks to end the monopoly of General Insurance
Corporation and Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) and has pegged
foreign equity in private insurance companies at 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Insurance Bill has been dogged by controversy over its
provision allowing up to 26 percent stakes for foreign companies
and another 14 percent for foreign institutional investors,
non-resident Indians, etc.

<HEADLINE> China Stranded While Iran Basks in Wrestling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese wrestlers stepped into
the live-or-die juncture as they were shut out in the gold
contention here on Sunday, while their Iranian counterparts bask
in confidence and approval.
</P>
<P>
China's hope to win a gold in the wrestling was dashed when
their last hope Sheng Zetian lost on his way to the final in the
58kg class race. The 25-year-old Olympic bronze medallist was
dispatched by Uzbekistan's A. Hudoyberdiev 3-0 in the second-round
race.
</P>
<P>
Sheng was the last Chinese wrestler to be ousted in the
Greco-Roman competition. His loss rang the knell of China's charge
for a gold in the Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
China's wrestling team leader Lei Jun held that they are now
embarking on a fraught course.
</P>
<P>
"If we fail to win a gold in the 2000 Sydney Olympics,
wrestling will face the danger of demise in China," the Chinese
wrestling official said.
</P>
<P>
"We got a lot of support from the people and the government
over the past 40 years, but we can't strike a gold in the
Olympics, we still by no means live up to their expectation. How
can this be brooked?" he added.
</P>
<P>
Lei said they have hammered out detailed plan for the 2000
Olympics. "We'll have no choice but win a gold in Sydney. "
</P>
<P>
China has got only two bronze medals at the Olympics, all
through Sheng Zetian at Barcelona and Atlanta respectively.
</P>
<P>
In sharp contrast to the stranded Chinese wrestlers, their
Iranian counterparts are basking in brimming confidence and
approval, though they won no gold either in the Greco-Roman race.
</P>
<P>
"We'll win a minimum of five golds in the freestyle
competition. I'm absolutely sure of that." said Iranian head coach
Daliria.
</P>
<P>
The lanky Iranian said they have reserved golds in 54kg, 58kg,
63kg, 85kg and 130kg, leaving only the golds of 69kg, 76kg and
97kg up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
Daliria explained why they are so strong. "Freestyle wrestling
is our national sport and has lasted for at least 50 years," he
said with some pride. "Students in schools and universities
practise wrestling, offering us a very good grassroots."
</P>
<P>
He said a plump purse is waiting for the wrestlers and their
coaches who can win golds in the Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
"The wrestlers who win a gold here will get a car from the
government," said the beaming Daliria. "The prize for the coach
whose wrestlers get golds is even bigger, they will get a house in
addition to a car," he added.

<HEADLINE> Czech Industrial Production Dives Down in Past Six Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Czech industrial production
suffered a 7.6 percent plunger in October this year in comparison
with the corresponding month of 1997, according to the latest
figures from the Czech National Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
It would register a meager 2 percent growth rate this year,
much lower than previously expected, the bureau predicted.
</P>
<P>
Depression in industrial production was started in the second
half of this year, with a negative increase of 1.8 percent first
emerging in September.
</P>
<P>
In October, production in many departments, such as textiles,
timbering, papermaking, oil, coal and metallurgy, fell by more
than 10 percent, with the leather industry by as high as 40
percent. Only the departments of electronic optical instruments
and machinery grew by 8.7 percent and 8 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Czech industrial production had suffered a huge loss since its
economic restructuring in 1991. It began a recovery in 1994 to
achieve the highest growth rate of 8.9 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Lack of funds, out-of-date technologies, slow renewal of
equipment and internationally uncompetitive products are
considered the major reasons behind the depression.
</P>
<P>
The financial crises in Southeast Asia and Russia, which have
brought barriers for Czech's industrial exports, also contributed
to the slump.
</P>
<P>
As industrial production plays a significant role in Czech's
economy, its depression has added to the ailing of the economy.

India's Defense Ministry had objections to duty-free imports of
radar and satellite communication equipment and the government in

</P>
<P>
"Putting items on open general license and allowing imports of
zero duty implies that the domestic industry has no protection

Forty-four countries are making efforts to work out the IT

<P>
BANGKOK, December 14 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's Ji Sung-Hwan set
a new Asian Games cycling record when he took the men's 1-km time
trial title here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect a gold medal today because the Japanese rider
is very strong. I just tried my best," said 27-year-old Ji, who
beat Olympic bronze medalist Jumonji Takanabu of Japan to second.
</P>
<P>
Ji, who had won the 4-km team pursuit gold at the last Games in
Hiroshima, Japan, finished in one minute, 5.406 seconds to improve
the previous record of 1:05.851 set by Japan's Masanaga Shiohara
at Hiroshima.
</P>
<P>
Takanabu, who pocketed the silver medal in 1:07.011, said he
was at peak form but the South Korean was simply stronger.
</P>
<P>
"I am not strong enough to win," said 23-year-old Takanabu. "I
was sorry that I did not win the first velodrome gold for Japan. I
will start anew to prepare for the Sydney Games."
</P>
<P>
Chen Keng Hsien came third in 1:08.364 for the bronze, the
first ever Asian Games medal in this event for Chinese Taipei.

<HEADLINE> Smooth Relocation of People for New Guangzhou Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The relocation of people to
make room for the construction of a new international airport in
Guangzhou, capital of southern China's Guangdong Province, has
been carried out smoothly.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, apartment buildings and supporting
infrastructure in four residential districts specially constructed
for resettlement have all been completed in the city of Huadu.
</P>
<P>
Early last month, residents from five villages drew lots for
their future homes, and now some of them have already moved into
their new dwellings, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The new Guangzhou International Airport is located in Huadu, 17
kilometers from the Baiyun International Airport now in use. The
new airport will cost 18.9 billion yuan and will cover an area of
16 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of construction, to be completed in three
years, includes the building of two 3,800-meter-long,
60-meter-wide runways, a terminal building with a floor space of
280,000 square meters, and a parking apron for 72 aircraft.
Construction will begin soon.
</P>
<P>
More than 20,000 people from 6,000 rural families in nine
villages will have to be relocated. Buildings covering a combined
floor space of more than one million square meters will be torn
down to make space for the new airport.

<HEADLINE> Control Tower Blamed for Thai Airbus Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The control tower failed to
give proper guidance when the ill-fated flight 261 of the Thai
Airways International was attempting to land in a tropical storm,
aviation sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The flight, Airbus A310-200, made two failed attempts to land
at the airport in the southern province of Surat Thani before
coming in for the third fatal approach. A total of 101 people on
board were killed and 45 others injured, some of them seriously.
</P>
<P>
Probing the cause of the accident, investigators blamed the
control tower at Surat Thani airport for removing a landing system
which would allow aircraft to touch down safely in bad weather six
months before the crash.
</P>
<P>
The Instrument Landing System (ILS) might help pilots in
landing "to a certain degree", Supoj Kampeera, deputy
director-general of the Commercial Aviation Department, said.
</P>
<P>
He said ILS was not installed in all airports in Thailand. The
system was removed from the Surat Thani airport to make way for
the expansion of the runway.
</P>
<P>
But all pilots, both civil and military, had been informed that
the ILS system was not operating at Surat Thani and they had to
rely on radio system and runway lights, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the pilot, who also died in the accident, should not
have tried to land if he could not see the runway.
</P>
<P>
The decision to attempt a third landing during a rainstorm
appears to contradict the airways' policy.
</P>
<P>
In June, when the airline announced it was phasing out the use
of foreign pilots in favor of Thais, the crew had been instructed
to exercise great caution.
</P>
<P>
"Pilots have been told to divert to other airports if they have
the slightest hesitation over weather conditions at any airport,
in Thailand or abroad," said Chamlong Poompuang, deputy vice
president of flight operations. "This means no landing in stormy
weather. They've been told to be passive and conservative. It's
better to be safe than sorry."
</P>
<P>
Survivors of the crash said the pilot, Phinit Wetchaisil, had
complained about poor visibility during his landing attempts.
</P>
<P>
A Thai pilot told reporters that he could probably guess what
had been on Phinit's mind.
</P>
<P>
"Flying to Bangkok meant you cost the airline too much extra.
This could have weighed on the man at the crucial moment," said
the pilot, who refused to be named.
</P>
<P>
Thai Airways International has cut back on a number of
services owing to the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Instructions to save fuel were perhaps sending conflicting
signals as far as safety and economy were concerned, sources said.
</P>
<P>
The precise cause of the accident is still under investigation.
Aviation sources refused to speculate.

<HEADLINE> Plant Renting Popular in East China City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, December 14 (Xinhua) -- People in the city of Dongying
in eastern China's Shandong Province can now rent beautiful
miniature landscapes, potted flowers and trees for decoration from
local dealers.
</P>
<P>
Huang Shunqiang, manager of the Shengda Park and Wood Company,
the largest business offering such service, noted that his company
has provided plants to four governmental organizations and have
contracts with a bank, a hospital and several companies since its
establishment last November. Their monthly business volume now
exceeds 60,000 yuan (7,000 U.S.dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
"We also offer timely supply for meetings, and opening
ceremonies." said Huang.
</P>
<P>
The company provides more than 200 units of flowers and trees
to the Shengli Petroleum Administration, the second largest
oilfield in China, to decorate the corridors of their office
building. The plants are changed once a month and the Shengda
company's gardeners tend to them according to contract.
</P>
<P>
One official said it would be too expensive to plant and take
care of these trees and flowers themselves, so renting them is
more economical and gives them a wider range of choices.
</P>
<P>
Many local residents find it very convenient to rent beautiful
plants and decorate their apartments on special occasions.
</P>
<P>
There are now dozens of plant rental companies in the city and
most of them are doing well.

and information.

<HEADLINE> China Hard to Retain Women's Team Title in Archery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Out of four gold medals at
stake in the archery, China only hopes to retain its women's team
title, said a veteran Chinese competitor on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We will feel great should we can succeed in retaining our team
title," said 29-year-old Wang Hong who ranked 11th in the women's
qualification started on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Both South Korea and Chinese Taipei are too strong for China to
break their dominance in the sport, but "we still cherish the hope
to keep the team title with our most efforts."
</P>
<P>
The 13th Bangkok Games only offers four gold medals in the
men's and women's individual and team finals with the first to be
competed on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the individual qualifications, South Korea established their
envious dominance by taking two of the top three spots in the
women's event and sweeping three men's berths.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xiaozhu had the best for the Chinese women with 636, a far
cry from 648 for South Korea's Kim Jo-Sun, but a narrow lead of
one point over a pair of Chinese Taipei competitors of Liu Pi-Yu
and Lin Yi-Yin.
</P>
<P>
Other two Chinese women ranked seventh and eighth respectively
with 626 and 625 points.
</P>
<P>
In the men's event, all the top three places were taken by
South Korea through Han Seung-Hoon, Kim Kyung-Ho and Oh Kyo-Moon.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Zhao Faqiao ranked fourth with 608, a long distance
from 619 scored by two Koreans not to mention the 637 points
scored by Han Seung-Hoon.
</P>
<P>
However, a click of lucky sometimes may affect the eventual
winners as China reapt its team gold after Indonesia upset hot
favorite South Korea in the team event, Wang Hong said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Liu Hongyu Wins Women's 10km Walking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Liu Hongyu of China claimed
the title of the women's 10 kilometers walking at the Asian Games
here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Liu, fourth placer in the event at last year's World Athletics
Championships in Athens, clocked 43 minutes 57.28 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Rie Mitsumori finished second in 44:29.82 and Svetlana
Tolstaya of Kazakhstan third in 45:29.95.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Liu, who had a personal best of 42:38.00, met
no fierce challenge from her two Japan rivals, whose compatriot
won three out five gold medals on Sunday from the track and field.
</P>
<P>
"If they pushed me hard, the time might have faster," Liu said
after the win.
</P>
<P>
This will be the last time for the women's walkers to compete
in the 10km race since the event will be replaced by 20km in the
international competitions next year.
</P>
<P>
"I will be more confident of winning the longer race," Liu
said.
</P>
<P>
Liu's teammate Li Yuxin, gold medalist in the Asian Athletics
Championships last July in Japan, was disqualified with 2km left
after receiving the third warning. She was in the third place
before receiving the third warning.
</P>
<P>
"I have nothing to say," Li said. "I can only say that I should
perfect my technique in the future training."
</P>
<P>
But she admitted that it was usually impossible to be warned
for the third time because she had slowed down after getting the
first card.
</P>
<P>
"I slowed my pace with more than two minutes per lap," she
said."I don't know why."

<HEADLINE> China Wraps up Shooting Competition with 18 Golds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese sharpshooters wrapped
up their Asian Games competition with a formidable sweep of 18
golds, 8 silvers and 8 bronzes here.
</P>
<P>
World powerhouse China struck three more golds here than at
Hiroshima, Japan, in 1994 but now their leading position is being
threaten by a pack of countries that include DPR Korea and
Thailand which were taken as minnow before the Games.
</P>
<P>
DPR Korea has fielded unknown pistol specialists here, who
won three golds, all team.
</P>
<P>
But that could be the tip of the iceberg and at the next Games
in the South Korean town Pusan they could pose threat to the
Chinese, who are also good at pistol events.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, helped by a Ukraine coaching staff, has seen great
progress in the rifle events and also claimed three golds, more
than that of the whole Thai delegation at Hiroshima.
</P>
<P>
While shooters from other countries complained about the
wind-prone facilties, Thai shooters performed confidently with
months of experiences in the venue.
</P>
<P>
Kazakshtan and Kuwait, who won their first Asian shooting golds
at the last edition, consolidated their position on the medal
tally table.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the South Koreans struggled helplessly when they won
only two golds to slip to sixth here, far from seven golds and
second place at Hiroshima.
</P>
<P>
Former powerhouse Japan also fared poorly, returning home with
only one gold.
</P>
<P>
"The times when China, Japan and South Korea took most of golds
was apparently over," said Chinese head coach Zhang Heng.
</P>
<P>
"I could face a tougher job in the next games if I am demanded
to win half of the golds."

<HEADLINE> Southwestern China Farmers Creating Water Control Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in arid areas of
southwest China's Sichuan Province are focused on building small
water conservation projects this year, which they find very
effective for alleviating water shortages.
</P>
<P>
Statistics provided by local governments show that some 430,000
small water conservation facilities have been built in the
province, which can store two billion cubic meters of water and
effectively irrigate 341,000 hectares of farmland.
</P>
<P>
Farmers living in mountainous villages in Sichuan have long
regarded water conservation facilities as their family property,
because creating one more wells or ponds means a considerable
increase in output and annual income.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, local farmers have been organized to dig
wells and ponds in dry areas to increase water conservation and
develop aquatic products.
</P>
<P>
Local sources said that about 80 percent of the money for these
small water control projects was raised by the farmers themselves,
with the remainder coming from government subsidies.
</P>
<P>
These projects have greatly benefited the development of fruit,
waterfowl and aquatic products, and helped enlarge the local
economy.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the projects have brought substantial profits
to local farmers. Through raising fish and planting trees, farmers
in the city of Bazhong have increased average annual income by
1,000 yuan per household.
</P>
<P>
Presently, local authorities in Sichuan are stepping up efforts
to make full use of their meager water resources in the area in
order to increase grain output and promote the development of the
aquatics industry.

<HEADLINE> Lhasa Better Self-supplied with Vegetables in Winter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Lhasa, capital city of Tibet,
will become better self-supplied with fresh vegetables in winter
thanks to the its increasing number of suburban greenhouses.
</P>
<P>
Vegetables including tomatoes and cucumbers are growing well in
the greenhouses of suburban Lhasa, capital of southwestern China's
Tibet Autonomous Region, in spite of the area's freezing winter
cold.
</P>
<P>
Lhasa mayor Losang Changtsan noted that the high yield of
these greenhouses will help alleviate the gap between supply and
demand in the city's vegetable markets.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Lhasa could only supply less than 30 percent of
the vegetables needed from December to April, and 75 percent of
from May to November, and the variety was limited to potatoes,
radishes, and Chinese cabbages.
</P>
<P>
To change this situation, the local government has set up 37
vegetable greenhouses in the suburbs of Lhasa in the past three
years, and it is estimated that the yield this year will reach
200,000 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The spinach seeds introduced from the Ningxia Hui Autonomous
Region, which are able to thrive in the cold weather of the
Tibetan plateau, are expected to yield 150,000 to 225,000
kilograms per hectare, and the yield of tomatoes and cucumbers
will be 97,500 kilograms per hectare.
</P>
<P>
Losang Changtsan said Lhasa will be able to supply vegetables
to its 170,000 local residents at the same prices as those in
nearby provinces, once the total greenhouse area reaches 40
hectares.

<HEADLINE> Reform Measures Drive Shanghai Residents to Save More in Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 14 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey shows that
most people in China's leading commercial and financial city of
Shanghai prefer to invest their money in bank accounts to other
dispositions.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the local branch of the People's
Bank of China, about 54 percent of the people surveyed prefer bank
deposits to other forms of investment, given that the current
interest rate remain unchanged, while 19.1 percent of them choose
to spend money in shopping, and another 28.4 percent prefer buying
securities.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the investment preferences to a number of the
country's reform measures, such as encouraging purchases of
private homes and waning domestic consumption demand.
</P>
<P>
The survey also indicates that the number of urban and rural
residents who are saving to buy or build their own homes has
increased by nine percent compared with the results of a similar
survey conducted three months ago.
</P>
<P>
Of the people surveyed, 23 percent believe their incomes have
increased, and about half consider current consumer prices to be
"a little higher" or "acceptable." And a large majority are
confident about the stability of next year's consumer
prices.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- At least 109 companies with a
combined capital stock of 25.75 million U.S. dollars in the
Philippines folded up in the first nine months of this year owing
to the Asian financial crisis, newspaper Today said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted the Security and Exchange Commission as
saying that the number of companies that stopped operating from
January to September rose 32.9 percent to 109 from 82 in the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
But the commission said the capitalization of the companies
that shut down was 50.4 percent lower than the 52.25-million-U.S.
dollar capital stock of those which folded up last year.
</P>
<P>
The commission said the effects of the currency turmoil was
more evident in the second and third quarters when 83 firms folded
up.
</P>
<P>
Many companies were dissolved when they merged with other
companies, their partners withdrew or died, or they were converted
to corporations, officials of the commission said.
</P>
<P>
The industry most affected by closures was the manufacturing
sector, followed by real estate and services. Agriculture, fishery
and forestry came third.

<HEADLINE> Courtyard Economy Becoming Cornerstone of Rural Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, December 14 (Xinhua) -- A cottage industry
featuring the growing of fruits, vegetables and herbs in rural
courtyard homes is playing an increasingly important role in
China's rural economic development, and in some places, it has
become the cornerstone of the local economy.
</P>
<P>
More and more farmers are turning to this environment friendly
way of growing food to earn some extra income right in their
household courtyards, according to experts at the Chinese Academy
of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
"The structure, functions and environmental quality of China's
courtyard ecosystem have a bearing not simply on an individual
farmer or village, but on the overall agricultural ecosystem and
the quality and quantity of food," said an expert.
</P>
<P>
"And the rural ecosystem is closely linked with the urban
ecosystem," said Tian Kuiyang, deputy director of the academy's
Research Institute of Agricultural Modernization in Shijiazhuang,
capital of north China's Hebei province.
</P>
<P>
The academy's twenty years of research has demonstrated that
courtyards in rural areas provide 80 percent of the energy and
substances needed in the agricultural ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
Yun Zhengming, an academy research fellow, pointed out that
this cottage economy is an indispensable component of the
agricultural ecosystem. He added that courtyards are also an
important place for cultivating, developing and restoring
productive forces.
</P>
<P>
Research fellow Liu Jintong said that a major social concern is
turning courtyards into ideal places for farmers to live and grow
their crops, and in this way to prevent the occupation of too much
arable land.
</P>
<P>
China has approximately 200 million rural household courtyards,
covering some 3.6 million hectares of land, 3.6 percent of the
country's total farmland.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The German government is to
grant equipment for a 200-bed hospital unit and a special burns
unit in Sri Lanka, the official Daily News reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ulrich Heuhne, director of the German Help Foundation, said the
equipment will be handed over to the teaching hospital at
Kurunegala in the North Western province where a separate wing to
house the equipment is under construction.
</P>
<P>
An experienced team of German surgeons will visit there
regularly to train local surgeons on the functioning of the unit,
said Dr. Heuhne.
</P>
<P>
The project is being sponsored by Interplast Germany, a German
humanitarian service organization which provides free plastic
surgery and other medical facilities to third world countries.
</P>
<P>
Six German plastic surgeons belonging to Interplast have been
sent to Sri Lanka on a ten day mission. Seventy-three operations
were performed by them during the period ending last week.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Heuhne said this assignment is the 12th project of
Interplast Germany, the previous missions having been carried out
in remote areas, since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Interplast which is assisting 24 countries has already sent 11
teams to Sri Lanka during the past five years. Over 1,250
operations had been performed during the period.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Sees Faster Growth in Collectively Owned Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The economic powerhouse of
Shanghai now has half of all its businesses collectively owned,
and this sector has seen an annual growth rate of 20 percent for
seven straight years.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's economy has been undergoing major restructuring
since the early 1990s, during which collectively owned businesses
have shown strong growth momentum.
</P>
<P>
Employing 2.98 million people or 31 percent of the city's
total, 98,000 collectively funded enterprises realized 107 billion
yuan in total industrial output value last year. They were also
responsible for 68 billion yuan, or more than 20 percent in
added-value, and contributed nine billion yuan, or 19.2 percent,
to the tax coffers.
</P>
<P>
This sector has become a driving force investing in Shanghai's
high and new technological industries, which has created 60,000
jobs with per-capita labor production exceeding 10,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
A number of such enterprises have scaled up, such as the
Shanghai Lihua Biochemical Plant which began with 2,000 yuan of
initial capital in 1982. It now has grown into China's largest
paint producer with net assets valued at 1.6 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Thai Airways to Compensate Crash Victims' Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Thai Airways International
(THAI) officials said Monday that relatives of each person killed
in Friday's plane crash would be compensated 3.6 million baht
(100,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Compensation for injuries and disability resulting from the
crash will be decided on a case-by-case basis, but THAI will
shoulder all medical expenses plus an initial compensation of
200,000 baht (5,555 dollars), the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the compensation complied with the
international standard.
</P>
<P>
The flight 261 of the airways crashed in the southern province
of Surat Thani in a tropical storm, killing 101 people on board
and injuring the others.
</P>
<P>
Survivors blamed the pilot, who survived but later died, for
making three abortive attempts to land instead of diverting the
plane to a nearby airport. The control tower at the Surat Thani
airport was also blamed for failing to give proper guidance.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated Airbus A310-200 and its passengers and crew had
been insured with three local insurance companies -- Dhipaya
Insurance, Bangkok Insurance and Deves Insurance.
</P>
<P>
The three companies, the officials said, had reinsured
themselves with international insurance companies in Britain,
Japan and the United States and were negotiating for
compensations.
</P>
<P>
Jaruek Kangwalpanit, managing director of Dhipaya Insurance,
said the company alone would pay 18.72 million dollars to THAI for
damages.
</P>
<P>
He said his firm would pay 200,000 dollars as compensation for
the death of the pilot. The families of the co-pilot and stewards
would each receive 80,000 dollars. The next of kin of each
on-board mechanician would receive 40,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Jaruek said his company was coordinating with THAI to pay
compensation over deaths and injuries.
</P>
<P>
Somjainuek Engtrakul, chairman of Dhipaya Insurance, said his
company would have no problem in meeting its obligations because
it had insured over 90 percent of its liability with foreign
companies.

SHIJIAZHUANG, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Investment from American

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Witnesses Declining Fish Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The aquatic products market in
south China's Guangdong Province has been subject to a continually
increasing oversupply due to lower consumption and stagnating
sales in other regions, according to a recent issued of the
Guangdong-Hong Kong Information Daily.
</P>
<P>
Fish prices have fallen by an average 10 percent, with prices
in the Pearl River Delta plummeting by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Eel prices have dropped from a record 200,000 yuan per ton to
only 40,000 yuan, with turtles selling for 50 yuan per kilogram,
down 10 percent on the record high.
</P>
<P>
The paper attributed the declining prices to increased
suppplies of aquatic products shipped from other parts of the
country and Southeast Asia, as well as dropping in demands from
outside the province.
</P>
<P>
A tight economy has forced many migrant labors to leave
Guangdong, causing decline in consumption of cheaper fresh-water
fish. In addition, local residents have substantially reduced
their consumption of more expensive fish.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Train Civilians to Deal With Unrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Defense Minister
General Wiranto said the government is to arm thousands of
civilians with batons and shields to help security for the general
elections next year, and to cope with the recent spate of
lawlessness in the crisis-ridden country.
</P>
<P>
"In the first stage we expect to have 40,000 trained civilians
who will be deployed in troubled areas," Wiranto said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the recruitment process is to take place in
January 1999 and will be under the command of the National Police,
who will then be responsible for screening, processing and
training civilian militia.
</P>
<P>
After selection and training, civilian militia will be paid in
accordance with minimum provincial wages.
</P>
<P>
"Concerns abound that civilians should not be armed. These
trained civilians are not armed... but (they) do have the ability
to deal with security disturbances, and they will use batons and
shields," national newspapers Monday quoted Wiranto as saying.
</P>
<P>
The military has come under fire for its failure to prevent the
rampant violence and crime taking place in the country.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, representatives of Jakarta's diplomatic
community urged the Armed Forces (ABRI) to address the issue as
many foreign businessmen and diplomats had been harassed en route
from Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta airport to the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Since former president Soeharto's downfall last May amid the
country's worst economic crisis in decades, law and order has
become a growing problem in Jakarta and other parts of the country
with the military apparently unable to prevent the worst excesses.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto said the police force, numbering 200,000 out of a
population of more than 204 million, is simply not large enough.
</P>
<P>
The plan to train civilians has received mixed reviews.
Abdurrahman Wahid, leader of the 40 million-strong Nahdlatul
Ulama, said he could go along with the idea "as long as it is
managed by the armed forces."
</P>
<P>
Those who support the plan include ruling Golkar (Functional
Group) chairman Akbar Tandjung and Hamzah Haz of United
Development Party, though both have called for caution.
</P>
<P>
Leading opposition politician and senior Muslim figure Amien
Rais, however, expressed alarm at the proposal. "I urge that the
plan to train youths and arm them be scrapped because arming
civilians could lead to civil war," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nurmahmudi Ismail of the Justice Party has also said no to the
plan, warning of possible impacts as dire as armed clashes among
civilians.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Yellow cards collected in
European club soccer competitions in 1998 will not be taken into
account in the quarter-finals, UEFA said in a statment on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It means that players who collected their second yellow card
of the Champions' League, UEFA Cup or European Cup Winners' Cup
will not be suspended for the quarter-final first leg games and
will start with clean sheets.
</P>
<P>
However, all red cards, including those awarded for a second
bookable offence, will stand and will attract the usual
suspensions.
</P>
<P>
The changes are the result of new regulations introduced for
the 2000 European championships and the Champions' League but
UEFA said they decided to extend them to all three European club
competitions for the sake of uniformity and fairness.

<HEADLINE> Foster Leads World Record Charge at Euro Swimming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 13 (Xinhua) -- British swimmer Mark Foster
set two world records in six hours at the European short-course
swimming championships in Sheffield on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Briton twice lowered the men's 50 meters freestyle mark.
</P>
<P>
There were also world records for fellow Briton James Hickman
and Germany's Sandra Voelker, a European record for Slovakia's
Martina Moravcova and three world bests in sprint relays.
</P>
<P>
That brought the tally at the three-day meeting to 13 world
records and bests.
</P>
<P>
Foster clocked 21.31 seconds in the 50m freestyle final to
beat the 21.48 he had posted in the morning heats to reclaim the
record from Russian Olympic champion Alexander Popov.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Foster surged clear on the first length of
the 25-meter pool and won by nearly half a second from Mark Veens
of the Netherlands, who swam 21.79.
</P>
<P>
Popov had taken the record from Foster back in March 1994 when
he swam 21.50 in Desenzano, Italy.
</P>
<P>
His masterly swims were the sixth and seventh individual world
records of the championships and earned him 40,000 marks (24,000
U.S. dollars) in prize money.
</P>
<P>
Voelker made it eight with a superb victory in the women's 50m
backstroke. The German, winner of Saturday's 100m backstroke,
clocked 27.27 to beat the 27.64 mark set by China's Bai Xiuyu in
March 1994 in Desenzano, Italy.
</P>
<P>
Hickman collected his third title of the championships but
missed his second world record of the day by a whisker when he
won the 100m butterfly final in 51.04, just 0.02 of a second
outside the world record he set in the morning's heats.
</P>
<P>
Both times were inside the 51.07 world short-course mark set
by Australian world long-course champion Michael Klim at a World
Cup meeting in Sydney on January 22 this year.
</P>
<P>
Hickman was in great form in Sheffield, winning the 200m
butterfly on Friday and the 200m individual medley on Saturday.
He was also bronze medallist in the 100m individual medley.
</P>
<P>
Hickman turned dead level at the halfway mark with world
short-course champion Lars Frolander but gained the edge over his
Swedish rival with his long underwater kick out of the turns.
Frolander challenged him all the way and Hickman touched at the
end only 0.07 in front.
</P>
<P>
Moravcova clinched her third title of the meeting and broke
the European short-course women's 200m freestyle record in the

</P>
<P>
Moravcova, who set a 100m individual medley world record and a
100m butterfly European record on Saturday, clocked one minute

by Germany's Franziska van Almsick in Beijing on January 9 1993.

<P>
Van Almsick, returning to the top, was happy to clinch the
silver in 1:57.05.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Await Clinton Visit with High Hope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gaza City, December 13 (Xinhua) -- "The Palestinians are
gratefully waiting for U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit,
because it means so much to us," said Maher Mahmoud Mostafa, a
restaurant owner in the center of the city.
</P>
<P>
Mostafa is just one of many Palestinians who regard the the
historic visit as indicating U.S. recognition of the Palestinian
aspiration for an independent state in the territories.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Palestinian and American flags are flying high
along the main streets of Gaza, the headquarters of the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA), one day before Clinton
arrives for a one day visit.
</P>
<P>
A large banner depicting Clinton smiling and PNA Chairman
Yasser Arafat gesturing a sign of victory is hung on the wall of a
building near the World Trade Center of Palestine, or Shawa
Convention Center, where Clinton will attend a meeting of the
Palestinian National Council (PNC) Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The PNC meeting is called upon in the latest peace deal signed
by Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in
Washington on October 23.
</P>
<P>
The 600-member PNC, the Palestinian parliament in exile, and
representatives from other Palestinian organizations, will
reaffirm the nullification of provisions in the Palestinian
charter calling for the destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Many Palestinians quickly point out that Clinton's visit will
be the first-ever by a sitting U.S. president and it comes only
four years after Arafat returned to Gaza and the PNA was
established.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, it was until 1979, or 31 years after Israel was
founded, that Jimmy Carter landed in Israel for a first
U.S. presidential visit.
</P>
<P>
In a major concession to Israeli insistence, Washington has
agreed that Clinton will arrive at the newly-opened international
airport in Gaza Monday morning by a helicopter, instead of Air
Force One as originally planned.
</P>
<P>
But for the Palestinians, this does not matter too much.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will receive a red-carpet welcome at the airport, a
new gateway to the outside world for the Gaza Strip isolated by
electronic wire fences and checkpoints. The national anthems of
both the U.S. and Palestine will be played by an honor guard.
</P>
<P>
For Nabil Atomeny, a 32-year-old taxi driver, Clinton's visit
would help the Palestinians and Israel end the conflict and bring
peace to the region.
</P>
<P>
As a member of the Fatah movement, Atomeny had served a
three-year sentence in an Israeli jail for throwing stones to
Israeli passers-by. He was released in May 1993, four months
before Israel and the Palestinians signed the historic Oslo peace
accords.
</P>
<P>
"At that time, every Palestinian would throw stones at
Israelis, but now it's different," he said.
</P>
<P>
Security was tight on the eve of the visit. When the night
fell, only few people walked on the streets. Atomeny explained
that Palestinian security officials have suggested that they would
better not to go out at night.
</P>
<P>
And Mostafa will have to close his restaurant Monday because
Clinton's motorcade will pass by the front street.
</P>
<P>
Policemen patrolled along the dusty roads around the home of
Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, founder and spiritual leader of the Islamic
Resistance Movement Hamas. He has been put under house arrest
since late October by the PNA.
</P>
<P>
About 60 women on a hunger strike, echoing those Palestinians
who are kept in Israeli jails, in the Al Remal Aria square, near
the PNC building and the Bank of Palestine, have been ordered to
leave their tent before Monday.
</P>
<P>
They said each of them has at least one family member are in
Israeli jails for anti-Israeli activities. More than 3,000
Palestinian prisoners went on a hunger strike about 10 days ago to
seek their release.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over Israel's refusal to release Palestinian
political prisoners have sparked a week-long violence in the West
Bank which left four Palestinians dead and more than 150
injured.
</P>
<P>
Severely weakened by no more intake than water, the women said
they would continue hunger strike in front of the Red Cross office
until their loved ones regain freedom.
</P>
<P>
Asked if they think Clinton's visit will help Israel and the
Palestinians resolve their dispute over the prisoners issue, Im
Jaber Weshah, who husband was put into jail in 1987 for attacking
Israelis, said, "we hope."

JERUSALEM -- The Wye peace accord is a good one and both
Israel and Palestine must fulfill their commitments to implement
it, said U.S. President Bill Clinton here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference after his talks with Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Clinton said some progress has
been made so far in implementing the Wye agreement, but the peace
process needs both sides to do more.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side has began its troops withdrawal from the West
Bank, reached an agreement on opening the Gaza airport with the
Palestinians and started the difficult process of releasing
Palestinian prisoners. These were the progress made by the Israeli
side, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNC) has also taken some
important steps within their commitments to implement the
agreement, such as deepening its security cooperation with Israel,
starting confiscation of illegal weapons, dealing with incitement
and taking concrete steps to ratify the PLO charter, he said.

JERUSALEM -- U.S. officials contacted Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat on Sunday to try to find out what the Palestinian National
Council (PNC) could do on reaffirming the nullification of the
clauses of the PLO charter calling for Israel's destruction,
according to a senior Palestinian official.
</P>
<P>
Arafat did not give the U.S. side a clear answer to this
question, but promised that the charter ratification process will
be satisfactory to President Bill Clinton when he visits Gaza on
Monday, the official said.
</P>
<P>
During his one-day visit in Gaza, the first of its kind for a
sitting U.S. president, Clinton will attend and address the PNC
meeting which will reaffirm the nullification of the clauses of
the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) charter calling for
Israel's destruction. (Israel-Clinton-Charter)

JERUSALEM -- Israel must live side by side with its neighbors
and only in this way the region can have a real peace, said
U.S. President Bill Clinton here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a big Israeli youth gathering at Jerusalem
convention Center attended by thousands of Israeli high school
students and army soldiers coming from different parts of the
country, Clinton said that every young Israeli should have a
vision for the future, that is to live in peace with others.
</P>
<P>
Fifty years has passed since Israelis established their own
country on this holy land, and millions of Jews lost their lives
for this, Clinton said, adding that the lessons gathered in the
past showed that if Israelis want to live in peace, they should
have to form partership with all its neighbors and live side by
side with them. (Israel-Clinton-Address)
