Mideast Peace Talks End Without Agreement
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- Israel and the Palestinians broke off their Camp David
summit late Wednesday night without agreement on resolving their 52-year-old
conflict, the White House said. Clinton was expected to issue a statement of his
own at the White House later and then board Air Force One for Japan to attend a
weekend conference on economics with seven other leaders. No details of the
final hangups were disclosed, but Jerusalem was believed to be the principal
stumbling block with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat wrangling over the city's future.

   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- The democratically elected government toppled during
Fiji's two-month hostage crisis met Thursday to discuss setting up a new state
in the western part of the country, Fiji radio said. The meeting came a day
after coup leader George Speight reportedly forced a delay in the Fiji's new
Cabinet taking office, a move that raised concern of a return to the civil
unrest that has plagued this Pacific island nation. Speight threw Fiji into
crisis on May 19 when he led an armed gang into Parliament and took dozens of
lawmakers hostage.

Bush on Verge of Picking VP

   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- George W. Bush said wednesday he was on the verge of
picking his running mate and suggested that a vice presidential candidate should
pose little political risk to the ticket. ''You want somebody who's not going to
hurt you,'' Bush said. Twelve days before the opening of the national convention
that will formally make him the Republican presidential candidate, Bush told
reporters at an impromptu news conference, ''I will make up my mind soon.'' A
number of Republicans are urging the Texan to sit on his lead in polls and make
a ''safe'' pick.

House OKs Raising IRA Contributions

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House overwhelmingly passed a bill raising
contribution limits for individual retirement accounts and 401(k)s Wednesday,
hoping to boost Americans' anemic savings rate. President Clinton said the
measure doesn't do enough for low-income people but did not threaten a veto. The
House voted 401-25 to send the measure to the Senate, with 182 Democrats joining
nearly all Republicans in favor. Senate supporters say they will push for action
in early September. Sponsors called the bill a partial answer to a U.S. savings
rate.

   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) -- After a day of talks Wednesday to end Burundi's

<HEADLINE> U.S. Salmon Plan Keeps Snake Dams  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HUGHES
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Clinton administration officials said
Wednesday they will not recommend breaching the Snake River dams
for at least eight years while they give a soon-to-be-released
salmon recovery plan time to work.
</P>
<P>
   Removing the earthen portions of the four 100-foot-high dams in
southeastern Washington state would be insufficient to recover
salmon, would not help Columbia River stocks and would divert funds
from other salmon efforts, said George Frampton, acting chairman of
the White House Council on Environmental Quality.
</P>
<P>
   ''While it is tempting to think of a silver bullet -- a single,
visible, tangible action that by itself will solve all our problems
-- it is ultimately a disservice to the challenge we face to embrace
such a simplistic approach,'' he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Officials instead propose a broad array of recovery measures --
habitat improvements, harvest controls and changes at salmon
hatcheries -- that they say will require great sacrifices from
landowners, governments and Indian tribes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The single choice of dams in, dams out is the easy part,''
said Will Stelle, regional director of the National Marine
Fisheries Service.
</P>
<P>
   The statements were the most comprehensive answer yet to a
question that has dogged administration officials for years -- will
they breach the dams that environmentalists detest and farmers,
shippers and power users say they need?
</P>
<P>
   But rather than settle the issue, the statements fanned the
flames of dispute over dams and became entangled in presidential
politics.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, speaking at a news conference in Austin, Texas,
criticized the Clinton administration and Vice President Al Gore
for declining to take a clearer position on whether to breach the
Lower Granite, Little Goose, Lower Monumental and Ice Harbor dams.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe we ought to be breaching the dams,'' Bush
said. ''He (Gore) needs to stand up and let us know his position.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, campaigning in Kansas City, Mo., was asked about Bush's
criticism and said he would carefully review the administration's
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what is needed is to bring all the stakeholders
together,'' Gore said. ''I'm going to bring all the parties
together to come up with a solution that respects the environment
and that does not cause an upheaval in the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore issued a statement later calling on Bush to ''stop playing
politics with this issue.''

<HEADLINE> Rightists Free Colombia Lawmaker  </HEADLINE>
By JUAN PABLO TORO
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A right-wing paramilitary group freed a
Colombian senator and former guerrilla Wednesday, a day after his
family reported he had been killed, officials and relatives said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmaker, Carlos Alonso Lucio, had fled to Cuba two years
ago to escape criminal charges, but had secretly returned to
Colombia and was seized by paramilitary fighters.
</P>
<P>
   He was abducted while conducting sensitive negotiations between
leftist rebels and the militias headed by Carlos Castano, the
national paramilitary chief said in a letter faxed to local
television stations.
</P>
<P>
   But Castano said Lucio had been an unreliable and pro-rebel
intermediary in the contacts with Colombia's second-largest leftist
insurgency, the National Liberation Army, or ELN.
</P>
<P>
   Without detailing the substance of the talks between the bitter
rivals, Castano said Lucio was trying to make him appear ''weak.''
</P>
<P>
   Following his release in the rugged Andes mountains of Cordoba
State, Lucio was flown to Bogota and taken to jail after giving a
news conference at which he blasted the proceedings against him and
portrayed himself as a ''resurrected'' champion of peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just want to tell Colombia that I made a bet on peace and I
lost,'' said an exhausted-looking Lucio.
</P>
<P>
   Lucio, 35, said he had slipped back into the country in January
and headed to the mountains to try and facilitate peace talks. He
did not give details on his dealings with Castano and the ELN.
</P>
<P>
   He said he held no ill feelings toward the militia boss, and
even urged that the paramilitary groups be included in peace
negotiations which until now have only involved the government and
two large guerrilla groups.
</P>
<P>
   Castano faces numerous indictments for assassinations of
left-wing politicians and human rights workers, as well as
massacres committed by men under his command.
</P>
<P>
   President Andres Pastrana has said he is not prepared to
negotiate with the landowner-backed rightists, who have committed
widespread civilian massacres in a scorched-earth campaign against
suspected rebel supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Government and ELN negotiators are scheduled to meet next week,
however, in Switzerland in the first major talks with the group in
nearly two years. Pastrana is also negotiating with a larger
insurgency, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Lucio's father and a member of Lucio's nationalist
political movement reported the senator had been abducted and
executed on Castano's orders.
</P>
<P>
   An ultra-nationalist, Lucio is best known for his fervent
opposition to extraditing Colombian drug suspects to the United
States.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Hits Historic Home Run  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Barry Bonds hit career home run No. 476 in
the fourth inning of San Francisco's game against San Diego on
Wednesday night, moving into sole possession of 18th place on the
all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   For Bonds, who was tied with Stan Musial and Willie Stargell
before connecting against Brian Meadows, it was also his 300th home
run for the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   The homer, a three-run shot that tied the game at 3, landed in
McCovey Cove, the water just outside the right-field fence at
Pacific Bell Park.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fifth ''splash hit'' for Bonds this season, and was
only the sixth time a ball has landed into the water on the fly.
Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley is the only opponent to reach McCovey
Cove.

   PHOENIX (AP) -- Ray Lankford rejoined the St. Louis Cardinals'

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Colorado Rockies outfielder Larry Walker was
ejected from Wednesday night's game at Los Angeles by plate umpire
Scott Higgins after arguing a called third strike to end the sixth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, whose first-inning single was the only hit allowed by
Dodgers right-hander Kevin Brown through six innings, briefly

   Butch Huskey, acquired from Minnesota over the weekend, replaced
Walker in left field.
</P>

   The game was tied 1-1 when Walker, who entered the game hitting

the sixth on Dave Hansen's three-run homer.

<HEADLINE> Flyers Hope To Lure Back Lindros  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Eric Lindros has yet to sign a qualifying
offer from the Philadelphia Flyers, and general manager Bob Clarke
hopes the star center looks past their contentious relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ''I talked to Eric the day of the draft, from the draft table
and explained that he doesn't have to like me, but he does play for
his teammates,'' Clarke said Wednesday in a television interview on
Comcast SportsNet, which is owned by the same company that owns the
Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a good team. This is a good city to play hockey in,
and we hoped he'd come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindros, still recovering from his sixth concussion, has until
Aug. 1 to decide whether to sign the $8.5 million qualifying offer.
However, the offer includes a two-way contract that would allow the
Flyers to send Lindros to their AHL affiliate, the Philadelphia
Phantoms, and pay him a minor-league salary of $85,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Lindros family reportedly was insulted by the offer. In
making the two-way offer, the Flyers invoked a clause in the
collective bargaining agreement which states that a qualifying
offer to a restricted free agent can be a two-way offer if the
player has played fewer than 60 games the previous season.
</P>
<P>
   ''The league wanted us to follow the rules,'' Clarke said.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros played 55 games last season because of various injuries,
including four concussions sustained in slightly more than four
months. He would have to clear waivers before getting sent to the
Phantoms.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros is scheduled to see Dr. James Kelly, a concussion expert
in Chicago who has been treating him, a few days before the
deadline to sign the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm feeling a lot better. I'm seeing the doctor the end of
this month. I'll play when everything is clear,'' Lindros recently
told the London Ontario Free Press.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros, whose younger brother Brett was forced to retire
because of concussions, has considered retirement or possibly
sitting out up to a full year. He has also mentioned playing in
Europe where the style of play is less physical.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is more to life than just hockey,'' Lindros said.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros' relationship with Clarke, his childhood hero,
deteriorated this season to a point where the two didn't speak for
months.
</P>
<P>
   The boiling point came after Lindros criticized the team's
medical staff for failing to diagnose his second concussion of the
season on March 4.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke then stripped Lindros of his captaincy, and he was
ostracized from the team until he returned for Games 6 and 7 of the
Eastern Conference finals against the New Jersey Devils.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've always said all along that with him, (Keith) Primeau,
(Daymond) Langkow and (Kent) Manderville, with centers like that,
we'd have the best center ice in the league by a long ways and we'd
have a legitimate shot at winning the Stanley Cup and I think
that's what every player's goal is,'' Clarke said. ''It'd be nice
if we got along, but it's not necessary in my opinion. You're a
hockey player, you play for your coach and your teammates. Lots of
players don't like their managers, but you still play for your
teammates and that's what we encourage him to look at.''

<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Vickie Johnson scored 18 points to lead the New
York Liberty to a 78-55 victory over the Seattle Storm on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first and only meeting between the teams going in
opposite directions. New York (13-9) has won a season-high six
straight games while the Storm (3-19) have lost six in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson finished 6-of-11 from the field in the game, but was
4-of-5 in the second half when the Liberty pulled away for their
largest margin of victory this season.
</P>
<P>
   Tari Phillips had 17 points and nine rebounds for the Liberty,
while Becky Hammon added 16 points.
</P>
<P>
   Kamila Vodichkova and Quacy Barnes each scored 12 points to pace
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's Edna Campbell returned after missing 10 games with a
sprained right ankle. Campbell, the team's leading scorer at 15.5
points, finished with two points on 1-of-9 shooting in 26 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Hammon was responsible for New York's quick start. She scored 13
points in the first half on 5-of-6 shooting, including all three
attempts from outside the 3-point line.
</P>
<P>
   Hammon's second 3-pointer gave New York a 14-3 lead just 4:37
into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle struggled on offense early, scoring only six points over
the opening 5:24, all by Sonja Henning.
</P>

   The Liberty closed the first half with an 8-0 run to take a
42-29 lead.

<HEADLINE> 49ers Schulters Misses Practice  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKTON, Calif. (AP) -- Pro Bowl safety Lance Schulters was
missing from the San Francisco 49ers' first day of practice,
apparently staging a bizarre holdout.
</P>
<P>
   ''His wife put him on the plane, but somewhere along the way he
took a detour,'' said John McVay, 49ers' director of football
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials hadn't talked to Schulters as of Wednesday
afternoon, but they believe he dumped established agent Alan
Herman, and hired another representative who is telling him not to
report. Still, nobody is quite sure what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been told it could be a contract thing,'' coach Steve
Mariucci said.
</P>
<P>
   Schulters is in the final season of a three-year deal for
$358,000. Preliminary talks of a contract extension have been held,
but team officials said it didn't seem to be a priority for the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ''I talked to Lance on Thursday,'' defensive coordinator Jim
Mora said. ''He didn't mention anything about it. He said, 'I'll
see you on the 18th.' This just doesn't sound like Lance.''
</P>
<P>
   Herman was unavailable for comment Wednesday, but his office
said he would probably issue a statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers signed tackle Scott Gragg, defensive end Anthony
Pleasant and wide receiver/kick returner Kevin Williams. Gragg was
a four-year starter with the New York Giants but became a salary
cap victim in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to come here,'' Gragg said. ''I told my agent to keep
answering the phone, but to always keep an eye on the 49ers.''
</P>
<P>
   Gragg provides insurance in case left tackle Dave Fiore
struggles with his rehabilitation from knee surgery. Fiore is
healing ahead of schedule, but the 49ers are wary as he has
undergone five knee operations in his five years in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Pleasant is angling for a starting position at defensive end,
something he has done for the bulk of his 10-year career.
</P>
<P>
   Williams played with the Dallas Cowboys and won two Super Bowls
before signing as a free agent with Arizona. He spent the last two
years in Buffalo, and fills the 49ers need for a punt returner.

<HEADLINE> Putin Visits North Korea  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Vladimir Putin paid the first-ever
visit by a Russian president to communist North Korea on Wednesday,
meeting with leader Kim Jong Il and saying afterward that North
Korea's missile program is meant for peaceful purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The comment continued Putin's focus on derailing the proposed
U.S. anti-missile shield: U.S. officials say the shield will
protect against threats from nations like North Korea, while Putin
says the shield is unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-hour summit with Kim Jong Il, Putin said North Korea
offered reassurances that its missile program is for peaceful
purposes, Russia's Interfax news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   ''North Korea is even prepared to use exclusively the missile
technology of other countries, if it is offered rocket boosters for
peaceful space research,'' Putin was quoted as saying. Without
anyclarifications about his remarks, Putin left Thursday for a
visit to Russia's Far East.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear if North Korea was stepping back
from its demand for $1 billion a year from Washington in exchange
for a halt to missile technology exports.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has refused to stop developing such weapons for
self-defense. The North is believed to have missiles that can reach
Hawaii and Alaska. The CIA says North Korea has the potential to
develop longer-range missiles that could reach the continental
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on North Korea said it was doubtful Kim and Putin
discussed anything concrete regarding North Korea's missile
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're not in a position to argue that North Korea should
stop missile exports or stop developing its missile program,'' said
Samuel Kim, professor of political science at Columbia University's
East Asian Institute.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Russia is in no position to offer the amount of
economic aid that North Korea would need to make up for lost
earnings from missile exports.
</P>
<P>
   James Miles, an Asia analyst at the London-based International
Institute for Strategic Studies, said he did not interpret Putin's
statement as meaning that North Korea would halt its entire missile
program because missile exports have been a significant
foreign-currency earner for North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   At most, he said, the statement could indicate that North Korea
might give up developing the Taepo Dong, the long-range missile
that North Korea test-fired over Japan in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But even if that is the case, he said, ''I can't see how this
can be of any assurance to Japan and the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's visit is meant to mend relations between the
once-staunch ideological allies. But attention quickly fell on
Moscow's objection to a U.S. national missile defense system meant
to fend off any attacks from countries like North Korea and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ''Putin will do all he can do to persuade North Korea, because
it considers the U.S. anti-missile system a direct threat to its
security,'' said Chon Hong-san, a political science professor at
Pusan University.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Putin would be going on to the summit of the
leading industrial countries plus Russia, the so-called G-8, in
Okinawa, Japan, starting Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Putin can persuade North Korea to make gestures or express
in any form its intentions to stop or not to pursue further missile
developments, that would greatly strengthen his voice at the G-8
meeting,'' Chon said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin arrived from Beijing, where he and Chinese President Jiang
Zemin denounced the U.S. missile-defense shield.
</P>
<P>
   Putin told Kim that a friendship treaty ratified Wednesday by
the lower house of the Russian parliament would help boost
relations, Russia's Itar-Tass news agency said in a report from
Pyongyang. Putin invited Kim Jong Il to visit Russia, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin and Kim Jong Il signed signed a joint declaration calling
for preserving and strengthening the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
treaty, Itar-Tass reported from Pyongyang. The United States is
seeking to amend the ABM treaty to build its missile-defense
shield.
</P>
<P>
   Putin was met on his arrival in Pyongyang by Kim Jong Il, the
North's official Korean Central News Agency said in a report
monitored in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of people turned out to welcome Putin
along his 10-mile motorcade route, the North Korean agency said.
Russian TV footage showed cheering crowds lining the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The North Korean agency said bands at the airport played the
Russian and North Korean national anthems, followed by a 21-gun
salute as Putin inspected North Korean army, navy and air force
troops.
</P>
<P>
   Putin visited Kumsusan memorial palace, where the embalmed body
of President Kim Il Sung, father of Kim Jong Il, lies in state, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Soviet Union and North Korea were ideological
allies, relations soured after Moscow recognized pro-Western South
Korea in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In post-Soviet times, Russia, with its own economic problems,
neglected impoverished North Korea. In 1995, it backed away from a
military alliance with the North.

<HEADLINE> Quakes Hit Small Islands Off Tokyo  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Earthquakes, including a moderately strong
magnitude 5.1 temblor, rattled a string of volcanic islands off
Tokyo on Thursday, Japan's Meteorological Agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest quake was centered below the ocean floor off
Niijima, about 105 miles south of Tokyo, the meteorological agency
said. There were no reports of damage or injuries, said Takehiro
Iwamoto of the municipal office on Niijima, an island with 600
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Since 2,670-foot-tall Mount Oyama on the island of Miyakejima
began volcanic activity June 26, the Izu islands area has
experienced more than 25,000 earthquakes, including about 7,000
strong enough to be felt by humans. One person has been killed.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, a magnitude 6.2 temblor knocked down walls of
several homes and caused landslides at several locations on
Niijima, forcing the evacuation of about 400 people. Iwamoto said
275 people were still staying at public facilities and relatives'
homes.
</P>
<P>
   The evacuation came as Mount Oyama sporadically spewed ash and
smoke during the weekend. About 100 people were evacuated from
their homes on Miyakejima, but later were allowed to return home as
the volcanic activity appeared to subside somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone nations. It
sits atop four tectonic plates, slabs of land that move across the
earth's surface.

<HEADLINE> Repressed-Memory Murder Suit Tossed  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTINE HANLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal judge Wednesday threw out a civil
rights lawsuit filed against prosecutors and detectives by a man
who spent 6&AMP;frac12; years in prison after being convicted of murder based
on repressed-memory testimony.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Charles R. Breyer
also partially cleared George Franklin's daughter of liability in a
case that fueled national debate about the legal reliability of
repressed memory.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin, a former firefighter, was convicted in 1990 after his
daughter, Eileen Franklin Lipsker, said she recalled witnessing her
father crushing 8-year-old Susan Nason's skull with a rock in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin went to prison for 6&AMP;frac12; years, but a federal judge
overturned the conviction, saying jurors were improperly told that
Franklin had admitted the crime by remaining silent in the face of
his daughter's accusation during a jailhouse visit. The judge also
said the defense should have had the chance to prove that details
Lipsker claimed to remember firsthand were contained in newspaper
articles.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors decided against a retrial after learning that
Lipsker had falsely accused her father of a second murder.
</P>
<P>
   After his release, Franklin sued his daughter, her therapist,
prosecutors, detectives and expert witnesses, saying they
''trampled on my rights and the truth.'' He sought $1 from his
daughter and unspecified damages from the other defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Breyer already has dismissed the claims against the therapist
and witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In his latest ruling, Breyer found that detectives and
prosecutors who investigated the case did not arrest Franklin
without probable cause or violate his right to an attorney.

<HEADLINE> Son of Political Leader Kidnapped  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) -- A son of a local political leader has
been kidnapped in this violence-plagued border city and two other
kidnap victims -- one the son of a well-known singer -- have been
found slain.
</P>
<P>
   In the first case, four armed men intercepted a car carrying
14-year-old Victor Lagunas Penalosa on Wednesday and seized the boy
in the Playas de Tijuana residential area, the state attorney
general's office said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy is the son of Victor Lagunas Ruiz, president of the city
branch of the National Action Party, which won Mexico's July 2
presidential election and which has governed Baja California state
since 1989. Lagunas Ruiz also owns a chain of furniture stores.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate indication that politics was involved.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, police said they discovered the body of Leonardo
Martinez Aguilera, the 21-year-old son of well-known ranchero music
singer Beatriz Adriana. A friend of the victim, 20-year-old Aquiles
Velgis Hernandez, also was killed.
</P>
<P>
   A sobbing Beatriz Adriana appeared on the Televisa television
network late Wednesday and urged the death penalty for the killers
-- a sanction Mexico does not have.
</P>
<P>
   Adriana said her son was visiting his friend while on vacation
when kidnappers seized them and demanded several hundred thousand
dollars for the friend. By the time she arrived in the city, she
learned that they had been found dead.
</P>
<P>
   ''They threw him out like trash. That's not fair,'' Adriana
said, struggling to control her voice while tears fell from behind
her dark glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Tijuana, a fast-growing city of 1.2 million people, has been
plagued in recent years by murders linked to drug gangs who take
advantage of the city's location on the U.S. border. It also has
seen numerous kidnappings, though reported incidents had seemed to
taper off in recent months.

Camp David Summit Collapses After 9 Days
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- An exhaustive effort to break through a half-century of
Palestinian-Israeli conflict ended in failure Wednesday night at the wooded
presidential sanctuary that had lent its name to historic success in Middle East
peace. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
could not come to terms after nine days of talks shepherded by President
Clinton, and all three headed out from the Camp David retreat in a dismal rain
that matched the day's mood. Clinton, his face sagging with weariness during
several practically all-night sessions, returned to the White House to prepare
to fly almost immediately to Japan for an international economic conference.

groups. Thursday's display showed that one of China's biggest political

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 9, Rockies 1  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kevin Brown allowed just one hit in eight
innings and Dave Hansen hit a tie-breaking three-run homer in the
sixth Wednesday night as the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Colorado
Rockies 9-1.
</P>
<P>
   Brown (9-3), showing no ill effects from the tightness in his
pitching shoulder that caused him to be removed from his last
start, allowed only a first-inning single by Larry Walker before
retiring 23 of the last 24 batters he faced -- including the final
14.
</P>
<P>
   Brown walked one and struck out eight before being removed for a
pinch-hitter in the bottom of the eighth when the Dodgers scored
five runs off reliever Stan Belinda.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who threw 104 pitches, had a no-hitter while playing for
the world champion Florida Marlins in 1997. He ended up combining
with Mike Fetters on a one-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who left last Friday night's 5-3 loss to Anaheim after
one pitch in the eighth, allowed only a four-pitch walk to Todd
Helton in the fourth after Walker's single.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen, making just his 14th start of the season, hit the first
pitch from Rolando Arrojo (5-8) into the right-field seats after
Shawn Green and Eric Karros hit one-out singles in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The homer was Hansen's fifth; the previous four came as a pinch
hitter. Hansen, 9-of-29 as a pinch hitter this year and second on
the Dodgers' all-time pinch hit list with 85, had gone hitless in
his previous eight at-bats. He started at third base in place of
Adrian Beltre.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies, who have lost 12 of their last 14 games, scored an
unearned run in the first when Jeff Cirillo reached on an error by
shortstop Alex Cora, took third on Walker's ground single up the
middle and scored on Helton's infield out.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Grudezielanek, making his first start since July 6, doubled
with two outs in the third -- the first Los Angeles hit off Arrojo --
and scored on a single by Gary Sheffield to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo, facing the Dodgers for the first time in his career,
allowed six hits and four runs in seven innings while walking two
and striking out seven.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Krueter's two-run double highlighted the Dodgers' five-run
eighth. Belinda hurt his cause by walking the first three batters
in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Walker was ejected by home plate umpire Scott Higgins after
arguing a called third strike in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Dodgers manager Davey Johnson, who missed his fourth
straight game due to an irregular heart rhythm, was released from a
nearby hospital before the game and figures to return to the team
Thursday or Friday night. ... The Rockies and Dodgers, who hadn't
met previously this season, were playing the first of six games in
a nine-day span. ... Grudzielanek, who had been sidelined with a
viral infection, still looked a bit under the weather, but said he
was feeling much better. When asked before the game if the recent
illness was the worst of his life, he replied, ''By far.'' ... The
Dodgers optioned right-hander Mike Judd to Triple-A Albuquerque of
the Pacific Coast League and placed utility player F.P. Santangelo
on the 15-day disabled list. They recalled RHP Al Reyes from
Albuquerque and purchased the contract of 34-year-old infielder
Chris Donnels from the Dukes. ... Donnels, pinch-hitting for Brown,
hit an RBI double in the eighth.

<HEADLINE> Five People Found Hanged in Mexico  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The bodies of five people who had been hanged
in a gangland-type killing were discovered on Wednesday, according
to Sinaloa state officials in western Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies were discovered dumped along a highway north of the
Pacific coast resort and fishing center of Mazatlan, said Elizabeth
Lopez Mexia of the state attorney general's office. The motives for
the killings were not clear but it appeared to be ''a new style of
organized crime execution,'' she told the government's Notimex news
agency
</P>
<P>
   Lopez said the bodies were discovered heaped atop one another
with ropes still around their necks. Three had their feet tied. One
had been shot in the head as well.
</P>
<P>
   Among the victims was Guillermo Gurrola Gutierrez, 52, brother
of a former regional leader of the national oil workers union.
</P>
<P>
   Families of the victims told Mexia that the men were at a
workshop Sunday in Mazatlan when armed men burst in and seized
them.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo City Divided  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- On the south side of the
Ibar river, crowds relax on a balmy summer's evening, sipping
drinks and chatting with friends over the din of music blaring from
the radios of outdoor cafes.
</P>
<P>
   A few hundred yards to the north, the scene is the same. But the
language spoken is different. So is the money to pay the tab.
</P>
<P>
   And between the ethnic Albanian south bank of the river and the
Serb-dominated north stands a network of barbed wire, sandbags and
heavily armed French troops along a bridge which looks like an
international border between two hostile powers.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast between the Serb and ethnic Albanian parts of this
city speaks volumes about the nature of life in Kosovo more than a
year after the arrival of the United Nations and the NATO-led
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   This is the only city in Kosovo where large numbers of both
ethnic Albanians and Serbs still live -- close by if not together.
And it is the most ethnically charged Kosovo city, where hatreds
run the deepest.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians consider Kosovska Mitrovica symbolic of the
failure of the United Nations and NATO to build a united Kosovo.
Serbs see this city as their last chance to maintain a viable Serb
community in a province they consider the birthplace of the Serbian
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in a strong position here,'' said Oliver Ivanovic, the
leader of Kosovska Mitrovica Serbs. ''We have an obligation to
defend Serbs as best we can who are not in such a good position.''
</P>
<P>
   From the United Nations in New York, to the cluttered U.N.
offices in the dusty provincial capital Pristina, to the sandbagged
checkpoints manned by troops of dozens of nations, the notion of a
Kosovo partitioned into ethnic Albanian and Serb districts is
considered unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the Kosovo mission, enshrined in Security Council
documents and repeated by scores of international officials, is to
build a multiethnic society where tolerance -- if not affection --
prevails.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a stroll through the streets of this shabby industrial city
raises questions whether ethnic partition have already begun. From
the Ibar River bridge northward to the boundary with the rest of
Serbia about 25 miles away lives the largest Serb community left in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike small, isolated Serb pockets elsewhere, the Serb
community here has a safe route to Serbia which does not pass
through ethnic Albanian-controlled territory. Serb leaders here
feel an obligation to resist what they consider attempts by the
United Nations and NATO to split them from the Serb motherland.
</P>
<P>
   As a sign of that defiance, Serbs have resisted attempts by the
United Nations for them to register to vote in municipal elections
set for October. The balloting has been promoted as the first step
toward a democratic, multiethnic society here.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials say more than 1 million Kosovo Albanians
registered by the Wednesday deadline. Although no ethnic breakdown
has been released, U.N. officials acknowledge the vast majority of
registrants were ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials blame Serb resistance on intimidation by
hard-liners. Many Serbs say registering would have been an act of
disloyalty to the Serbian nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't understand the Serbian mentality,'' Serb activist
Nikola Kabasic said. ''The more you push down on the Serbs, the
more they will resist,''
</P>
<P>
   With the ethnic division of Kosovska Mitrovica, which began in
the first weeks of the NATO-led peacekeeping mission, the two
communities live side-by-side but apart. That was much the same
pattern existing here before the Serb crackdown and the NATO
bombing campaign which forced out Yugoslav police and soldiers last
year.
</P>
<P>
   On the south bank, passers-by greet one another and chat in
Albanian. Street signs are written in the Roman alphabet. Vendors
sell Albanian language newspapers from Pristina. Customers pay in
German marks, which the United Nations has decreed as the primary
currency.
</P>
<P>
   But don't offer a waitress or a sales clerk in the north
anything but Yugoslav dinars, lest the customer be reminded that
Kosovo remains officially part of Serbia, the main republic of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Many signs in the north are written in the Cyrillic alphabet.
And vendors sell the latest Serbian language newspapers from
Belgrade. Publications in Serbian are as rare in the south as those
in Albanian are in the north.
</P>
<P>
   No one dares speak the ''wrong'' language in public.
</P>
<P>
   On the south bank, cars bear new, U.N.-issued license plates:
black numbers on a white background with blue lines on the top and
bottom. In the Serb part of this city, cars are equipped strictly
with Yugoslav plates, which include initials of the town of
registry.

   Unlike small, isolated Serb pockets elsewhere, the Serb
community here has a safe route to Serbia which does not pass
through ethnic Albanian-controlled territory. Serb leaders here
feel an obligation to resist what they consider attempts by the
United Nations and NATO to split them from the Serb motherland.
</P>
<P>
   As a sign of that defiance, Serbs have resisted attempts by the
United Nations for them to register to vote in municipal elections
set for October. The balloting has been promoted as the first step
toward a democratic, multiethnic society here.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials say more than 1 million Kosovo Albanians
registered by the Wednesday deadline. Although no ethnic breakdown
has been released, U.N. officials acknowledge the vast majority of
registrants were ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials blame Serb resistance on intimidation by
hard-liners. Many Serbs say registering would have been an act of
disloyalty to the Serbian nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't understand the Serbian mentality,'' Serb activist
Nikola Kabasic said. ''The more you push down on the Serbs, the
more they will resist,''
</P>
<P>
   With the ethnic division of Kosovska Mitrovica, which began in
the first weeks of the NATO-led peacekeeping mission, the two
communities live side-by-side but apart. That was much the same
pattern existing here before the Serb crackdown and the NATO
bombing campaign which forced out Yugoslav police and soldiers last
year.
</P>
<P>
   On the south bank, passers-by greet one another and chat in
Albanian. Street signs are written in the Roman alphabet. Vendors
sell Albanian language newspapers from Pristina. Customers pay in
German marks, which the United Nations has decreed as the primary
currency.
</P>
<P>
   But don't offer a waitress or a sales clerk in the north
anything but Yugoslav dinars, lest the customer be reminded that
Kosovo remains officially part of Serbia, the main republic of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Many signs in the north are written in the Cyrillic alphabet.
And vendors sell the latest Serbian language newspapers from
Belgrade. Publications in Serbian are as rare in the south as those
in Albanian are in the north.
</P>
<P>
   No one dares speak the ''wrong'' language in public.
</P>
<P>
   On the south bank, cars bear new, U.N.-issued license plates:
black numbers on a white background with blue lines on the top and
bottom. In the Serb part of this city, cars are equipped strictly
with Yugoslav plates, which include initials of the town of
registry.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Diamond Industry Steps Out  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA CHARLTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- At mine offices on the Arctic permafrost and in
hushed vaults in Moscow's best-guarded buildings, the eyes of
Russia's diamond producers glint with optimism. This country, they
say, is primed to reap rewards from recent upheaval in the global
diamond industry.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is the world's second-largest diamond producer, but
Soviet-era restrictions and the De Beers cartel have crimped
Russian profits from the gems.
</P>
<P>
   Now South Africa-based De Beers is relaxing its grip on the
world's diamonds, and Russia is angling to make a name for itself
in the lucrative, secretive industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's time for Russia to step out in this business,'' said
Natalya Marakina, a member of the exclusive Russian Diamond
Chamber, a club for diamond producers. ''We are ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia has an advantage these days, as fears mushroom about gem
sales financing the wars in Sierra Leone, Angola and Congo. It
tarnished the meeting in Belgium of the World Diamond Congress,
which announced strict new measures Wednesday to clamp down on the
trade in ''Conflict diamonds.'' The issue is also on the agenda of
the Group of Eight summit in Okinawa, Japan, which begins Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Russians are an important source of non-bloodied stones,''
said John Meyer, an industry analyst with Societe Generale in
London. ''The diamond industry in Russia has had a pretty low
profile ... and this could be a pretty good marketing tool for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia produces about 20 percent of the world's rough diamonds --
$1.5 billion worth in 1999 -- and has vast untapped reserves.
</P>
<P>
   In Marakina's sanguine scenario, Russia's diamond monopoly
Alrosa would develop new mines and reach more markets. More exports
would bring increased government revenues -- the state owns a
majority stake of Alrosa -- and good news for an economy still hung
over from a decade of decline.
</P>
<P>
   But the industry is shackled by inefficiency and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Most Russian diamonds come from Sakha, formerly known as
Yakutia, a province five times the size of Texas that straddles the
Arctic Circle. Soviet authorities coaxed workers to the ever-frozen
wilderness with bloated salaries and generous benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Alrosa has trimmed the work force, but production costs remain
high -- about five times as much as De Beers spends extracting
stones from its South African deposits.
</P>
<P>
   Once they leave Yakutia, diamonds are guarded by a series of
private militias. Addresses of the Moscow vaults are a prized
secret.
</P>
<P>
   Yet smuggling abounds, and Russia's notoriously weak and corrupt
law enforcement officials are nearly powerless to stem it,
prosecutors say.
</P>
<P>
   The former head of the government's gem and precious metals
agency, Yevgeny Bychkov, has been charged with smuggling $183
million worth of diamonds and gold out of Russia to a San Francisco
company. He denies the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say the increased diamond activity that Alrosa wants
would only invite more crime.
</P>
<P>
   Another obstacle to development is the lack of investment,
because the Russian diamond industry clings to strict rules barring
foreigners from exporting the gems. In May, De Beers pulled out of
its only investment project in Russia, the Lomonosov field near the
Arctic city of Arkhangelsk, citing disputes with local officials.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Alrosa says it's ready to take advantage of the
industry's latest transformation.
</P>
<P>
   De Beers has stockpiled most of the world's diamonds since the
1930s to keep them rare and expensive. With profitability down and
its market share slipping, the company announced last week that it
would slash its stockpile and focus on boosting demand through a
new marketing arm called the Diamond Trading Company.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government said Friday that it would not renew its
agreement with De Beers when it expires next year. The contract
puts a strict cap on Russian exports, and critics say it is
stunting Russia's mining and cutting industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''After 40 years in the diamond business, Russia has grown out
of children's shorts and understands how to sell diamonds so as not
to harm the market or our own interests,'' said Valery Rudakov,
chief of Russia's precious gem reserves.
</P>
<P>
   But Alrosa's President Vyacheslav Shtyrov insisted Monday that
Russia isn't planning to sever ties with De Beers, and proposed
that his company buy a stake in De Beers' new Diamond Trading
Company.
</P>
<P>
   De Beers is keen to keep Russia on its side so the market won't
be flooded with gems.
</P>
<P>
   ''Russia is a long-standing partner,'' said company spokesman
Andy Lamont. ''If we can succeed in this new strategy it will be
good for all partners.''

<HEADLINE> Is Mexico's Fox President or CEO?  </HEADLINE>
By MARK STEVENSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The introduction of New Coke may have been a
mere marketing ploy for Coca-Cola, but for Mexico's new
president-elect it was a formative moment. Vicente Fox learned much
about political strategy during the cola wars of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   It's not surprising. Fox, a former top Coca-Cola executive,
calls his constituents ''clients,'' promises ''total quality'' and
sees himself more as a good manager than as a politician.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the stories Fox told me was about how Coca-Cola
introduced New Coke, and people didn't accept it,'' recalls a top
adviser, Adolfo Aguilar Zinser.
</P>
<P>
   Coke's marketing chiefs decided to hold firm as sales dropped,
then reintroduce the traditional cola flavor, and watch sales
rebound to higher than when the campaign started.
</P>
<P>
   That helped Fox learn ''how to stand still, not loose his temper
or spirit, because he will begin to figure out how to jump back,''
Aguilar Zinser said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox often comes across like a ''how to succeed in business''
manual, contrasting sharply with the paternal, almost monarchical
air of seven decades of his predecessors for the Mexican
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ''I read a lot of business books, a lot,'' Fox said, although he
was vague when asked which business leader most influenced his
style: ''Many, many of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest round in the transition to what some analysts call
Fox's vision of ''Mexico, Inc.'' came at a news conference two
weeks after he became the first opposition presidential candidate
in 71 years to defeat the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party.
</P>
<P>
   Fox pledged to run the government on a ''matrix-style management
plan, which is used in many organizations'' -- but which is a
mystery to most Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   Matrix management, a corporate fad begun in the 1960s,
establishes overlapping lines of responsibility, making employees
report to several bosses.
</P>
<P>
   A meta-manager -- in Fox's case, a Cabinet-level adviser -- would
be put in charge of promoting a ''product line'' -- an issue like
poverty or education -- across government departments as disparate
as tax collection, commerce and foreign relations.
</P>
<P>
   Would that make Fox a distant CEO, delegating authority to his
managers?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not. ''Matrix management also guarantees that top
managers must step in to resolve the very conflicts and disputes
guaranteed by the organizational design,'' analyst Michael Schrage
noted in a 1998 article.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it is quite a switch for Mexicans, used to a sort of
rarified, high-flown political rhetoric about the ''motherland''
and the ''historical conquests'' of the Mexican Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can learn a new political language, but the country is not
a corporation,'' said author and pundit Carlos Monsivais, who
claims Fox wants to treat the government as ''a mega holding
company.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't float a country on the stock exchange. If you do a
cost-benefit analysis on culture, it would get cut right out,''
Monsivais said.
</P>
<P>
   Such mistrust doesn't seem to faze Fox, who ''thinks that what
he provides is, more than anything, administrative skills,'' said
Aguilar Zinser, who is now a member of Fox's transition team.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whenever he goes to see a leader anywhere in the world, the
first thing he asks is, 'How do you handle taxes?' He very seldom
asks about politics,'' Aguilar Zinser said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who has sent out corporate headhunters to search for his
top aides, wants to choose his Cabinet ''as if he was recruiting
the CEO of Ford, G.M., CBS or NBC,'' Aguilar Zinser said.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to estimate how great the change will be in
Mexican political culture, long a nest of intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians who used vagueness as a shield -- the economy might
be full of ''bright spots and dark spots,'' or ''red lights and
yellow lights'' -- are likely to give way to painfully technical
discussions of decentralization and tax policy.
</P>
<P>
   Monsivais recalled an old saying that the only phrase one needs
in Mexican politics is ''Get them before they get you.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Now,'' Monsivais quipped, ''the only word that Mexican
politics will know how to conjugate is 'efficiency.'''

<HEADLINE> Camp David Summit Ends Without Deal  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat agreed to press on with their
exhaustive effort to resolve the half-century-old conflict between
their people. The announcement came just hours after the White
House said the summit had ended in failure.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody wanted to give up,'' President Clinton said early
Thursday in announcing the talks will go on without him while he
travels to Japan. ''There should be no illusion about the difficult
task ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, who looked tired and spoke hoarsely, said the
gaps between the two parties ''remain substantial but there has
been progress.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest obstacle to a peace agreement was believed to be the
future of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was staying behind with
Barak and Arafat as Clinton prepared to leave, a day late, for an
international economic conference in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to continue talking came at the last minute, when
delegation bags were packed and everyone was ready to go, White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all thought it was over, at least for now,'' Clinton said,
''and we discovered that nobody wanted to quit, nobody wanted to
give up, and that's encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We must all be prepared to go the extra mile.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Clinton spoke, Israeli and Palestinian officials
said the two leaders were ready to continue the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The summit will continue with Secretary Albright after
discussions that President Clinton had with both sides in order to
try to reach an agreement,'' a senior Israeli official said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are efforts now to resume the negotiations,'' said
Hassan Abdel Rahman, the Palestine Liberation Organization's
Washington envoy. ''President Arafat is not leaving the stage.''
</P>
<P>
   In the talks shepherded by Clinton, Barak and Arafat could not
come to terms.
</P>
<P>
   ''The summit has come to a conclusion without reaching an
agreement,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said when the
negotiations broke up shortly before 11 p.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the agreement to talk further, there was finger-pointing
on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   No details of the final hang-ups were immediately disclosed, but
Jerusalem was believed to be the main problem. Clinton was
understood to have pressed the two leaders to accept a U.S.-crafted
compromise on Jerusalem's future and other core issues, including
the disposition of Palestinian refugees.

<HEADLINE> Text of Mideast Summit  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Text of President Clinton's remarks on the Camp David
summit, as
transcribed by The Associated Press.
<TEXT>
<P>
   As all of you know, for the past nine days we have been engaged
in the most comprehensive and total negotiations ever between
Palestinians and Israelis on the core issues of their 52-year
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The two parties have been making an intensive effort to resolve
their differences over their most difficult issues. The gaps remain
substantial, but there has been progress, and we must all be
prepared to go the extra mile.
</P>
<P>
   After a round of intensive consultations this evening, the
parties agreed to stay at Camp David while I travel to Okinawa for
the G8 summit.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Lockhart will be able to fill you in on the details on how
this occurred. I have to take the plane and I'm running late, but I
do want to explain what happened.
</P>
<P>
   During the time I am gone, Secretary Albright will be working
with the parties and we'll continue to try to close the gaps. Upon
my return I will assess the status of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   There should be no illusion about the difficult task ahead, that
there should be no limit to the effort we're prepared to make.
</P>
<P>
   These are in fundamental ways the hardest peace issues I have
ever dealt with. But the short answer that we are still here after
everybody thought we were through is that nobody wanted to give up.
</P>
<P>
   After all these years, as hard as these issues are, they don't
want to give up, and I don't think we should give up. And so we're
still plugging away.
</P>
<P>
   But, so you should draw no inference from this, I will observe
the news blackout on the details and I will continue to do it, but
this is really, really hard.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you very much.

<HEADLINE> Rangers 3, Angels 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Right fielder Scarborough Green threw out
Scott Spiezio at the plate to end the game Wednesday night,
preserving the Texas Rangers' 3-2 win over the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   With Spiezio on second base and two outs, Kevin Stocker singled.
Green fielded the ball and threw on the fly to catcher Ivan
Rodriguez, who made the tag.
</P>
<P>
   Gabe Kapler homered and Dave Martinez had a pair of RBI singles
as the Rangers ended a three-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Rogers (10-7) won for the seventh time in nine decisions,
allowing two runs and eight hits in 6 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The left-hander, trying to avoid losing three consecutive starts
for the second time this season -- and second time in his 12-year
career -- struck out six, walked one and picked two runners off
first base.
</P>
<P>
   John Wetteland pitched the ninth and got his 24th save, thanks
to Green's throw.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, whose single to center in the fourth drove in
Rodriguez with the game's first run, put Texas ahead in the sixth
with a single off Kent Bottenfield (6-8). Rodriguez had led off the
inning with the Rangers' major league-leading 199th double.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler made it 3-1 in the seventh with a leadoff homer, his
fifth of the season and first on the road. He had his second
three-hit game.
</P>
<P>
   Spiezio sliced Texas' lead to 3-2 in the seventh with a two-out
RBI single. Edgard Clemente followed with a double, putting runners
at second and third and chasing Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Davis relieved, walked major league hit leader Darin Erstad
intentionally, then retired Stocker on a grounder to end the
threat.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, who has given up at least 10 hits in each of his
previous three starts, leads all AL pitchers with 158 hits allowed.
He was working on a one-hit shutout when rookie Bengie Molina
homered in the sixth to tie it at 1.
</P>
<P>
   It was Molina's 12th homer -- the most by an Angels catcher since
Lance Parrish hit 19 in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield, trying to win three consecutive starts for the
first time since joining the Angels in a trade for All-Star center
fielder Jim Edmonds on March 23, was charged with three runs and
eight hits in seven innings. The right-hander, who failed to strike
out a batter for the first time in his 19 starts this season, has
surrendered at least one home run in 10 of his last 12 starts
outings and 22 altogether.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Angels RF Tim Salmon, whose attempt at a sliding catch on
Sunday aggravated an already sore area in his left shoulder that
had bothered him for two weeks, pinch-ran for Mo Vaughn in the
eighth. ... Erstad, who began the game 10-for-29 lifetime against
Rogers, went 0-for-4. ... Molina called a pitchout in the sixth and
caught Martinez trying to steal second. It was the 24th baserunner
Molina has thrown out trying to steal in 65 attempts this season.
... Scott Schoeneweis, who hasn't pitched for the Angels since June
16 because of a strained right rib cage muscle, threw 79 pitches in
a seven-inning rehab start for Triple-A Edmonton against Oklahoma.
He allowed an unearned run and two hits while striking out six, and
did not get a decision in the Trappers' 2-1 loss.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 4, Cardinals 3  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Erubiel Durazo hit a two-run double and the
Arizona bullpen pitched four scoreless innings Wednesday night,
giving the Diamondbacks a 4-3 win over the St. Louis Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Lankford hit an RBI double in his return to the Cardinals'
lineup. He left the team after his 19-year-old brother was shot to
death Saturday night in the Los Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Reynoso (7-6) gave up three runs in five-plus innings.
Arizona relievers, who have lost a team-record six straight
decisions, protected the lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals scored three times in the sixth to close to 4-3.
After consecutive singles by Edgar Renteria, Jim Edmonds and
Fernando Tatis produced one run, Lankford's double chased Reynoso.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Springer relieved and gave up an RBI groundout to Craig
Paquette.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Swindell pitched a perfect seventh and eighth. Matt Mantei
pitched the ninth for his first save since July 9, and fifth
overall.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was only Arizona's fourth in the last 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett Stephenson (10-6), who threw a six-hit shutout against
the Diamondbacks on May 29, gave up four runs on seven hits and two
walks over six innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks never trailed, taking a 1-0 lead in the first
on a sacrifice fly by Luis Gonzalez and padding their lead with
three runs in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Williams singled up the middle to lead off and Steve Finley
and Durazo followed with doubles.
</P>
<P>
   After an out, Damian Miller got an infield single, and Durazo
scored on the play on Renteria's throwing error from shortstop.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Stephenson is 1-1 in four career games vs. Arizona. ...
When Reynoso struck out Paquette in the second inning, Arizona
became the second team (after Cleveland) to strike out 700. ...
Arizona's Tony Womack has six bunt singles in the last 10 games.
... Arizona has lost three straight home series for the first time
since Aug. 15-25, 1998, and needs to sweep the two-game set with
St. Louis to avoid its first below-.500 homestand since April.

<HEADLINE> House Passes $288B Defense Bill  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House approved a $20 billion increase in
Pentagon spending for next year, including pay raises designed to
keep men and women from leaving the military for civilian life.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 367-58, the House Wednesday approved a compromise
$288 billion defense appropriations bill and sent it to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, said the legislation ''provides the
funding for the security and defense of the United States and
assures that our military strength remains second to none.''
</P>
<P>
   The pay raise, he said, is of ''great importance especially for
younger military members with families and for mid-career personnel
who are considering abandoning the military for the civilian
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill spends nearly $20 billion more on Pentagon programs in
the year starting Oct. 1 than this year and $3.3 billion more than
requested by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just the increase in this bill is larger than the entire
foreign aid bill and the interior appropriations bill,'' said Rep.
David R. Obey, D-Wis., adding that the United States spends more on
defense than Russia, China, Iran, North Korea and Libya combined.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we are going to do that, we have an obligation to take care
of our other national priorities and make sure the accounting is
... forthright,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Obey asserted that the additional money goes ''not where it is
needed militarily'' to improve readiness but rather to award
defense contracts in states where it will help legislators
politically.
</P>
<P>
   A focus of the appropriations debate this year was to make
military life more attractive and thus stem the flow of men and
women from the armed forces to civilian jobs in the booming U.S.
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The bill includes a 3.7 percent military pay raise and 9 percent
increase -- $988 million more than last year -- for military health
care.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the bill worked out late last week by a Senate-House
conference committee includes $75.8 billion for military personnel;
$100 billion for operations, maintenance and working capital funds;
$59 billion for weapons procurement, $41.4 billion for research and
development and $14 billion for other Department of Defense
programs and classified amounts for foreign intelligence activities
by the department, CIA and other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Other specific items include:
</P>
<P>
   --$1.8 billion in emergency supplemental funds for this year,
partly to continue paying for operations in the Balkans and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   --$1.5 billion to help the Army quickly develop two new
4,000-person ''medium brigades'' that can deploy to the world's hot
spots within 96 hours.
</P>
<P>
   --$4 billion to buy and continue research and development on the

<HEADLINE> Senate OK's Prescription Imports  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alarmed by complaints that Americans are
paying more for drugs than foreign consumers, the Senate agreed to
lift a ban on importing prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which passed 74-21 on Wednesday, was attached to
the agriculture spending bill currently being debated in the
Senate. The debate centers on complaints that Americans are paying
more for drugs available at a cheaper cost in some other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''The American public wants affordable medicines,'' said Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. ''I believe we should do all we can to
reduce the financial burden imposed on our citizens by high drug
costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., ''If someone else is paying
half price or a third of the price than is being charged to the
American consumer ... why can't the American consumer have access
to those drugs in a global economy?''
</P>
<P>
   Critics charged it was too risky to import drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Breaux, D-La., said the Food and Drug Administration
and Department of Health and Human Services are already
overburdened. Certifying that drugs overseas are safe would be too
much, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can't do that,'' Breaux said. ''That's an impossible
burden.''
</P>
<P>
   Current law allows only a manufacturer to reimport its product
into this country. The measure approved by the Senate would allow
pharmacists and drug wholesale distributors to purchase and import
drugs that have been shipped from the United States to other
nations.
</P>
<P>
   The House has already passed similar measures. One House
provision would prohibit the Food and Drug Administration from
enforcing the import ban. The other House provision would allow
Americans to legally bring prescription drugs across the border
from Canada and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   A provision added to the Senate proposal by Sen. Thad Cochran,
R-Miss., sought to add additional safeguards by requiring the
Secretary of Health and Human Services to certify that there would
be cost reductions and that there would be no safety risks to U.S.
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has drawn heavy opposition from the pharmaceutical
industry, which has taken several full-page newspaper ads in recent
days urging Americans to call Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement after the vote, Alan Holmer, president of the
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said the
Senate's action ''could jeopardize patient safety and would not
ensure any savings for consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Both the House and Senate measures are based on the mistaken
notion that importation is a solution to make medicines more
affordable in the U.S.,'' Holmer said. ''The real solution is to
expand drug coverage for those who most need it -- elderly and
disabled Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House has not taken a formal position on the proposal,
an FDA spokesman said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> WW II Memorial Targeted Again  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Opponents of a proposed World War II monument
on the grand sweep between the Capitol and the Lincoln Memorial say
the location is wrong and the design flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Scott Feldman, the architectural historian among the
leaders of the opposition, objected to two arches -- one
representing the Atlantic theater of war and the other the Pacific.
She said they were triumphal arches that were traditional symbols
of European tyranny.
</P>
<P>
   She spoke recently with architect Friedrich St. Florian, who won
the design competition for the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   ''What struck me most is that four years later, he still doesn't
know what the message is,'' she said. ''We in America take people --
Washington, Lincoln, Jefferson -- and they become symbols. His
columns look like a battle graveyard in France. They could be in
Arlington cemetery.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Fine Arts Commission was considering that design at a
meeting Thursday. President Clinton dedicated the site five years
ago, but no ground has been broken.
</P>
<P>
   St. Florian's 56 columns, each 17 feet high, would flank the
small Rainbow Pool next to the Reflecting Pool that stretches in
front of the Lincoln Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Two big fountains would be reactivated in the Rainbow Pool,
named because rainbows were seen in the spray when they were first
turned on. The main jets would rise twice as high as the columns,
with a sculptured and illuminated ''Torch of Freedom'' between
them.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rainbows will still be there,'' St. Florian said.
</P>
<P>
   He told reporters earlier this week that the message would be
clear: the victory of democracy over tyranny.
</P>
<P>
   The National Coalition to Save Our Mall contends the site
belongs to the Lincoln Memorial and should remained untouched. It
wants to leave the space clear between the Lincoln Memorial and the
Washington Monument.
</P>
<P>
   The group cites architect Henry Bacon, who worked on the plan
for the area a century ago. Bacon wrote of the Capitol, the
Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial, then still unbuilt.
</P>
<P>
   ''All three of these structures,'' he said, 'stretching in one
grand sweep from Capitol Hill to the Potomac River, will lend, one
to the others, the associations and memories connected with each,
and each will have its value increased by being on one axis and
having visual relation to the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of new monument say the National Mall should not be
seen as belonging just to the 1800s, and that World War II was the
greatest event of the 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   The World War II monument would be financed by $100 million
being collected from private contributors.

<HEADLINE> Convicted Fund-Raisers Aided Mineta  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Commerce Secretary-designate Norman Mineta
received a handful of contributions in 1992 arranged by a convicted
Democratic fund-raiser who later acknowledged she reimbursed the
donors, congressional investigators' documents show.
</P>
<P>
   There's no evidence Mineta knew of the scheme by fund-raiser
Nora Lum to funnel $4,250 to his House campaign through straw
donors, congressional investigators found.
</P>
<P>
   Only $2,250 of the donations actually reached Mineta's campaign
treasury, Federal Election Commission records show.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Department spokesman Morrie Goodman said Mineta didn't
know about the scheme, and questioned why the fund-raising
documents surfaced the week that the Senate considered his
nomination as the first Asian-American Cabinet secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Lum was a prominent Democratic fund-raiser in the Asian-American
community during the 1992 election. She and her husband Gene were
each sentenced to 10 months confinement and fined $30,000 in 1997
after pleading guilty to a conspiracy charge alleging improper
fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   The transactions that resulted in the Lums' prosecution did not
involve Mineta's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Lums disclosed the straw donations to Mineta in a
1997 written offer of testimony to the House Government Reform
Committee, which has been investigating fund-raising abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The Lums told the committee through their lawyer that they
staged a fund-raiser in October 1992 for Mineta's congressional
campaign. The event was billed as the National California Asian
Pacific Leadership Awards.
</P>
<P>
   In their offer of testimony, the Lums indicated that the Mineta
event did not raise as much money as expected, and they made up the
difference by donating money themselves under other people's names
</P>
<P>
   ''The event fell well short of its goal and the witnesses made
up the difference with conduit contributions,'' the Lums' offer of
testimony said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lums' attorney, Cono Namorato, did not return a call to his
office Wednesday seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   One of the donors, Larry Wong, told the House committee in a
July 1998 deposition that Lum asked him to write a $2,000 check to
the Mineta campaign in October 1992. Lum said she would reimburse
him for the donation, Wong said.
</P>
<P>
   ''She wrote me a check first and asked me to write a check to
the Mineta campaign, which I did,'' Wong told committee
investigators. Wong told the committee that the check was never
cashed.
</P>
<P>
   Committee documents show that three other people, though listed
as contributing a total of $2,250 to Mineta's campaign, never wrote
checks from their personal accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The Lums' offer to testify before the committee was never
formalized in part because Democrats did not want to grant the
couple immunity from prosecution. No charges have been filed
against the Lums concerning those claims.
</P>
<P>
   In their criminal case, the Lums admitted to using ''straw
donors'' to conceal $50,000 in illegal donations. The money went to
the re-election effort of Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and the
unsuccessful congressional candidacy of W. Stuart Price of Oklahoma
in 1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and Price have said they were unaware of the source of
the donations. The Lums were the first guilty pleas obtained by the
Justice Department's campaign finance task force.

<HEADLINE> GOP Sends Clinton Less Costly Cut  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Upping the ante in their tax cut confrontation
with President Clinton, congressional Republicans have agreed to
send him a less costly version of their bill to eliminate the tax
marriage penalty in hopes of making a threatened veto more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to get something on his desk that's signable,'' said
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, which the House and Senate are aiming to
pass Thursday, millions of married couples would get some tax
relief this calendar year, but their total tax cut would be lower
than the amounts in earlier GOP bills.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary estimates put the bill's total revenue cost at about
$89 billion over five years. That compares with a 10-year, $248
billion version passed Tuesday by the Senate, and the House's
competing bill costing $182 billion over 10 years. A 10-year
estimate for the compromise was not available, but the agreement is
closer to the House version.
</P>
<P>
   If the compromise passes both houses of Congress this week, the
president would be forced to decide whether to sign or veto the
bill before the end of the Republican National Convention, which
starts July 31. Clinton had made his approval conditional upon
Congress passing an acceptable prescription drug benefit plan for
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, in Iowa on Wednesday campaigning for
president, said he remained opposed to the Republican measure.
</P>
<P>
   ''I support eliminating the marriage penalty but what this bill
does goes way beyond that and cuts taxes on people who are not
affected by the current provisions of the law and affects people
who are not married at all and is very, very expensive in terms of
the amount of money that would have to be made up in other ways
that would end up raising taxes in the future on people who can
least afford to shoulder that burden,'' Gore said in a KCRG-TV
forum with voters.
</P>
<P>
   Elimination of the tax code's marriage penalty, in which an
estimated 25 million couples pay more than they would if single, is
the centerpiece of the GOP's election-year tax cut agenda. The
Republicans' decision to send Clinton a less costly bill comes as
the White House has stepped up criticism that huge GOP tax cuts
could rapidly deplete the budget surplus even as government revenue
projections rise.
</P>
<P>
   The White House chief of staff, John Podesta, said in a letter
Wednesday to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., that an
estimated $700 billion in GOP tax cuts and spending bills that
exceed Clinton's request represented a ''huge spending binge'' in
an election year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now is not the time to abandon responsible budgeting by
spending money before it even comes in the door,'' Podesta said.
''We can cut taxes for the middle class, while maintaining fiscal
discipline and making critical investments in our future.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement gradually would enlarge the bottom 15 percent
income tax bracket for all married couples so that it is equal to
that of two single people. Under current law, two single people pay
the lower 15 percent rate on a greater share of their income than a
married couple.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate-passed enlargement of the next-highest 28 percent tax
bracket was dropped, partly to reduce White House claims that the
bill is skewed toward higher-income couples.
</P>
<P>
   That change would be effective on Oct. 1 of this year, much
quicker than in either of the previous versions and a month before
this year's election.
</P>
<P>
   Another change taking effect Oct. 1 would be adjustment of the
standard income tax deduction for married couples so that it is
equal to that of two single people. This year, that would increase
a married couple's deduction from $7,350 to $8,800.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement would also lift the income cap by $2,500 for
lower-income couples who claim the earned income tax credit, and
ensure through 2004 that married couples could claim personal tax
credits, such as the $500 per-child credit, without getting
entangled in the complex alternative minimum tax.
</P>
<P>
   Because the bill is governed by five-year budget rules, all of
the changes would phase out on Dec. 31, 2004. That means a future
Congress would have to make the tax cut permanent, or married
couples would get hit with a tax increase in 2005.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Albion guard fined on sex charge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBION, N.Y. (AP) - A former prison guard was sentenced to three
years probation and fined $1,000 on charges related to his having
had sex with a female inmate.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kozak, who worked at the Albion Correctional Facility,
pleaded guilty last month to official misconduct. He was originally
charged with third-degree rape.
</P>
<P>
   Kozak admitted to having a relationship with the woman that
ended in March. The woman said the relationship was consensual, but
according to state law an inmate is incapable of consenting to such
a relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The two first got together in the woman's cubicle, then in the
correction officers' bathroom, court papers show.
</P>
<P>
   Kozak was not allowed to remain a corrections officer because of
his conviction on the misdemeanor charge.
</P>
<P>
   The inmate's lawyer, Arthur Golbart of New York City, said he
wanted Kozak tested for HIV because he said Kozak had been accused
of previous sexual relationships with female inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Kozak is the second Albion guard to lose his job in the last
year following allegations sex with inmates. Another guard was
convicted of sexual abuse in September.
</P>
<P>
   Albion Correctional Facility is about 30 miles west of Rochester

would be insufficient to recover salmon, would not help Columbia River stocks

<HEADLINE> A True Links Test at British Open  </HEADLINE>
By TIM DAHLBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland (AP) -- His opponents bravely lined up to
say Tiger Woods can be beaten. His swing coach isn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   With the Old Course at St. Andrews playing as true to its links
past as ever, Butch Harmon says his star pupil is hitting the ball
better than when he ran away with the U.S Open last month at Pebble
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   That combination could prove historic.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not putting quite as well,'' Harmon said on the eve of
the 129th British Open, ''but we worked on it last night and it's
coming around.''
</P>
<P>
   Those might be words Woods' opponents dread hearing, especially
if the wind kicks up. Yet Woods is striking the ball so well that
Harmon pulled out a replica of the gutta-percha ball used a century
ago and had Woods play it on the ninth hole. His tee shot with the
gutta-percha, a solid rubber ball with lines scored across the
surface, traveled 113 yards less than a drive with his
swoosh-logoed ball. But Woods hit a 5-iron approach over the green,
chipped back up and still managed to par the hole.
</P>
<P>
   While Woods won't play the gutta-percha when the championship
gets under way Thursday, he said the wind would dictate his
selection of clubs off the tee, beginning with the 376-yard, par-4
first hole.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's dependent on the conditions. If the wind is blowing dead
in your face on the first hole, I'm going with the driver,'' he
said. ''I've done it before. But there were times I hit a chip
3-iron down there and a little sand wedge onto the green.''
</P>
<P>
   More likely to cut into Woods' length advantage is the
warm-weather front that settled in following one of the wettest
Junes on record. The Old Course is playing so hard and fast that
Woods' opponents stopped just short of thanking the Royal &AMP; Ancient
Golf Club, which sets up the course, for the unseasonably warm, dry
weather.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what the R&AMP;A wanted -- a true links test in the year
2000,'' said Scot Colin Montgomerie. ''If you did not have spikes
on, you would slip walking down the first fairway. It's incredible.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone is going to hit it an awful long way this week, but
it's where you hit it and where the second shots go that will be
the key. There will be a lot of what we might call sucker pin
positions that some of the less experienced players might go for
and find themselves in serious trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie bristled when his remarks about length counting for
less and experience for more were taken as a dig at Woods. ''I did
not mention any names,'' he shot back at his questioner. ''You
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, though, was mentioned by bookmaker William Hill as the
most prohibitive favorite ever, at odds of 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   When the game's oldest championship begins Thursday, Woods will
attempt to become only the fifth player -- and at 24, the youngest --
to win the modern career Grand Slam. The last player to win all
four majors was Jack Nicklaus in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Bookmakers list Ernie Els, who won Saturday at Loch Lomond and
was second to Woods in the U.S. Open, at 10-1. Next comes
Montgomerie and Englishman Lee Westwood at 14-1.
</P>
<P>
   Close behind were a number of players either looking to claim
their first major -- Phil Mickelson, David Duval and Jim Furyk -- or
major tournament winners seeking to add one more -- Davis Love III,
Nick Price, Vijay Singh and Justin Leonard. Rounding out the
favorite's list was handful of European stars from the last Ryder
Cup -- Darren Clarke, Sergio Garcia, Jesper Parnevik, Miguel Angel
Jimenez -- and Nick Faldo, who won the Open at St. Andrews in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   American John Daly, who won the Open when it was last played
here in 1995, was greeted by a huge roar when he played in a
four-hole ceremonial match Wednesday afternoon with previous
winners of the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   But few of the fans who lined the 1st and 18th holes to watch
apparently weren't willing to wager money on him. Daly was listed
at odds of 125-1, along with defending champion Paul Lawrie, the
Scot who injured a wrist Tuesday when a youngster he was teaching
struck him with a club.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrie lost a practice round, but said it might pay off in the
long run.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had one practice round last year and won,'' he said. ''So it
didn't interfere with my plans at all. I had the day off, I chilled
out. It was nice.''

<HEADLINE> Lopez Renews Quest for Women's Open  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   GURNEE, Ill. (AP) -- There are so many Nancy Lopez memories at
the U.S. Women's Open.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing second in 1975 at just 18, a preview to the incredible
career that was to come. Battling Hollis Stacy while trying to hide
a broken zipper. Shooting 60s in all four rounds at Pumpkin Ridge
in 1997, yet still finishing second. Waving the white flag of
surrender at Blackwolf Run.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the memory that Lopez knows so well but has
waited her whole career to live.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I win the U.S. Open, I'm going to camp out on the green and
I'm going to stay out there for a whole night just to enjoy it,''
she said Wednesday. ''I'm just going to stay there and just think
about that last day and that last hole and the crowd and everything
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez has been chasing this dream since 1974. Already a member
of the Hall of Fame with 48 career victories and three major
championships, it's the only piece missing from her illustrious
career.
</P>
<P>
   She's come as close as you can possibly get four times and yet
always come up short.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's times when I walk away from a U.S. Open and I just
really want to go slit my wrists because I'm so frustrated because
I've played poorly,'' she said. ''But then you walk away from the
U.S. Open, where you play great golf courses that you really,
really love. And that's what golf is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   She couldn't have known it was going to be like this in 1975,
when she matched strokes with her idol, JoAnne Carner, and finished
second behind Sandra Palmer. Or two years later, when she
challenged Stacy, a three-time Open champion.
</P>
<P>
   But here she is, at 43, still giving chase. The title means so
much she was even willing to qualify for this year's tournament,
which began Thursday at the Merit Club.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she happened to call the U.S. Golf Association office
to see what she needed to do to qualify on the very day officials
were deciding to give her a special exemption.
</P>
<P>
   ''That night, (someone) called me and left a message on my
answering machine and told me they had given me a special exemption
to play the U.S. Open. I was very, very excited,'' she said. ''I
flew through the house trying to find everybody to let them know I
did have the call that I was given a special exemption.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was really, really thrilled.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning means so much she even took a lesson, something she'd
never done before -- unless you count the ones her father gave her.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel really good right now. I've been hitting the ball
really well,'' she said. ''The way I feel about my game right now,
I feel like I have a good chance to play very well here. And I
certainly would like to get to the top on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   She hasn't even made the cut the last two years, and she's no
longer considered a favorite for the event. That distinction now
belongs to players like Karrie Webb, Annika Sorenstam and defending
champion Juli Inkster.
</P>
<P>
   But if she ever wonders if she should give up the dream, all she
has to do is remember 1997. Just like this year, Lopez worked hard
before the event, getting her game and body in shape. She shot
69-68-69-69 at Pumpkin Ridge, the only person in the history of the
Women's Open to shoot all four rounds in the 60s.
</P>
<P>
   It still wasn't enough, though, as her 20-foot birdie putt that
would have forced a playoff with Alison Nicholas stopped an inch
from the cup.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt really good about that one,'' she said. ''That's the
one I felt like I should have taken with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she is here, still hoping to sit on a green Sunday
night and watch the stars.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it would be great,'' Inkster said. ''Everybody would
root for Lopez to win the Open. ... I think everybody in the locker
room would be there, right by her side, rooting for her.''

<HEADLINE> Some Swimmers May Shun Bodysuits  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some of America's top swimmers might shun full-length bodysuits
in the Olympic trials, even though the sport's U.S. governing body
reversed a ban on the revolutionary outfits.
</P>
<P>
   Backstroker B.J. Bedford and sprinters Bill Pilczuk and Amy Van
Dyken are among those considering other suits for the trials that
will determine the team for the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   USA Swimming's board of directors voted 15-6 Tuesday night to
reverse the ban on the full-length suits in the trials, to be held
Aug. 9-16 in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   That means any full-length suit approved by FINA, swimming's
world governing body, will be allowed. The suits -- some of which
cover the entire body except for head, hands and feet -- already
were cleared for use in Sydney and all other meets.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm really happy,'' said Van Dyken, who last week criticized
USA Swimming's ban. ''Even though I may not wear the suits at
trials, I like to have freedom of choice. That's what America is
all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Several swimmers said they're tired of the fashion debate,
especially with the trials just three weeks away. The top two
finishers in each event qualify for Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be nice if they could make the decision and stick to
it,'' said Bedford, who had already decided to wear a knee-length
suit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would just like to see them make up their mind,'' Pilczuk
said. ''There is a bit too much politicking and it's affecting us
because we're having to think too much about what suit we're
wearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Malchow, who set a world record in the 200-meter butterfly
last month wearing the full-length suit, applauded the reversal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's probably the best thing for swimming in the long run.
It's going to give people a chance to swim as fast as possible,''
he said. ''You don't want to show up at the Olympics in a suit you
haven't worn before.''
</P>
<P>
   USA Swimming had voted less than a month ago to ban the
high-tech attire in the trials because of concerns there wouldn't
be enough suits to go around. But, facing a grievance from one
manufacturer and hearing assurances that all of the 1,300
competitors would have a chance to wear the suits, the governing
board changed its mind.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was not an easy decision and there are merits to both
sides of the issue,'' said Chuck Wielgus, executive director of USA
Swimming. ''But with the U.S. Olympic team trials being just three
weeks away, it was important to get this issue resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Pilczuk of Auburn, Ala., believes the full-length suits should
be banned for all meets because they favor muscle-bound swimmers
over skinnier athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole suit floats you. The more buoyancy you get, the less
you have to pull through the water,'' he said. ''When you put
material that floats on people who have more muscle, they can float
better. I don't think it's a very level playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   Bedford of Colorado Springs, Colo., wore the full-length suit
for the first time when she broke the American record in the
50-meter back at last year's World Cup meet in Europe. She prefers
the knee-length version.
</P>
<P>
   ''They reduce drag and I feel a lot faster and a lot better in
the water,'' she said. ''I like the feel of the water because it
helps me to know where my body position is.''
</P>
<P>
   Bedford predicted swimmers who are young and inexperienced or
who aren't performing well would be most affected by the reversal.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you think the suit works for you, it's going to work for
you,'' Malchow said. ''Sometimes the mental battle is the hard
battle, you can't train for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pilczuk, the '98 world champion in the 50 freestyle, plans to
experiment at the trials. He'll wear the knee-length version in the
preliminaries and switch to the full-length suit in the semifinals.
Whichever one he's fastest in will be worn in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   USA Swimming asked four leading suit manufacturers -- TYR,
adidas, Speedo and Nike -- to make their high-tech suits available
to all swimmers by June 14, giving them plenty of time to get
comfortable in the new attire before the trials.
</P>
<P>
   When only adidas met the deadline, the board voted June 22 to
ban full-length suits at the trials. Afterward, the manufacturers
insisted they could handle the demand.
</P>
<P>
   Nike said last week that it had switched its production lines to
turn out suits in compliance with the ban, and spokesman Bob
Mitchell said Wednesday the company will have enough full-length
suits to outfit its 300 swimmers.
</P>
<P>
   Malchow said it's time for the suit to take a backseat to the
swimmers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The suit shouldn't detract from the overall feel of the meet.
The meet should be about swimming and the times and the people,''
he said. ''This suit is getting as much attention right now as any
individual. Hopefully, the suit story will die eventually.''

<HEADLINE> 2 Vets, Newcomer make up U.S. Team  </HEADLINE>
By TIM KORTE
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mari Holden started out as a triathlete, Karen Kurreck was a
gymnast and Nicole Freedman a runner.
</P>
<P>
   Now they're cyclists, and not just any cyclists. Holden, Kurreck
and Freedman make up the United States women's road cycling team
for the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Holden, of Colorado Springs, Colo., and Kurreck, of Los Altos,
Calif., are time-trial specialists who improved their road skills
by racing in Italy over the past several years.
</P>
<P>
   Kurreck, the 1994 world time-trial champion, credits the summers
in Europe with making her a top-notch rider.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a national series in Italy that is almost like doing
world championships every week, but without the stress,'' she said.
''It's not often that you can race the best regularly in one-day
races.''
</P>
<P>
   Holden, too, went overseas after being left off the American
team for the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. She has won five national
time-trial titles, including the past three, and credits her
experience in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ''You rise to the occasion,'' said Holden, who also won last
year's national road race title. ''I've had four years of hard
racing, and I feel I'm ready to be racing internationally at that
level.''
</P>
<P>
   To sharpen up before Sydney, the Americans will compete later
this month in Germany and France.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've raced with Karen in Europe before and she's a strong
rider,'' Holden said. ''I haven't raced with Nicole much. ... We'll
get a chance to know her better.''
</P>
<P>
   It's going to be a crash course in international racing for
Freedman, who took up cycling in the early 1990s when her career as
a Stanford middle distance runner sputtered.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't feel like I'm being thrown in,'' she said. ''I think
it will be good to go over and sample the international riders and
I'm really looking forward to riding with Mari and Karen.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll all be quick learners,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Holden, 29, and Kurreck, 38, will compete in the time trial in
Sydney, while Freedman, 28, will join them for the road race. It
marks the first Olympic appearance for each.
</P>
<P>
   Most women's road races feature teams of six to eight riders.
The Olympic race, with three riders representing each country, is
difficult to forecast.
</P>
<P>
   However, Holden and Kurreck should contend in the time trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I have a good day I have a good chance of a medal, but
everything has to come together,'' said Holden, who started riding
with the U.S. women's team to improve in the triathlon.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the road race, which involves a mass start, riders in
individual time trial leave a starting point at intervals and race
for the fastest times.
</P>
<P>
   Freedman earned her spot on the team by winning the Olympic
trials road race in Jackson, Miss., in May.
</P>
<P>
   The other positions were chosen by U.S. Cycling coaches and
administrators, who based their decisions on two years of
international racing results.
</P>
<P>
   Kurreck, a former college gymnast at Illinois, has competed at
the past seven world championships.
</P>
<P>
   ''She has the ability to compete in both the road race and
individual time trial and has made steady progress throughout her
international competitions,'' U.S. coach Henny Top said.
</P>
<P>
   Freedman lives in a van parked outside a house near the Stanford
campus. She doesn't drive it, she just sleeps there. She showers
and eats at the home, where friends live.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still live in the van in Palo Alto, but one good thing is
that one of my housemates is out of town for a while,'' she said.
''I'm in that room for a few weeks.''

<HEADLINE> NFL Camps Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Ryan Leaf is expected to see action for the San Diego
Chargers
during the exhibition season, provided the troubled quarterback
gets through the first 10-14 days of training camp.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leaf, who enters camp as the No. 3 quarterback, hasn't played
since Dec. 13, 1998, when he came off the bench in Seattle and
promptly committed the final three of his 19 turnovers during his
disastrous rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, Leaf hurt his right shoulder 20 minutes into the
first training camp workout, had surgery and didn't play a down all
year, although he managed to get himself suspended for four weeks
for cussing out then-general manager Bobby Beathard.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do think he can play in an exhibition game,'' coach Mike
Riley said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On days the Chargers practice twice, which generally is every
other day, Leaf will sit out one of the workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once we get through a couple of weeks of camp, maybe 10 days,
we'll know how far along we can go with that, and what we can
expect,'' said Riley, the Chargers' third head coach since they
drafted Leaf with the second pick overall in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   During voluntary offseason workouts, Leaf was criticized by
fullback Fred McCrary for being out of shape, and after that the
quarterback pretty much disappeared from the training complex until
a mandatory session, choosing to work out with a personal trainer.
Seahawks:
</P>
<P>
   Mike Holmgren would like hook up again with Reggie White in
Seattle, while Philadelphia wants to set up its own reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren, Seattle's coach and general manager, said he talked
with the career sacks leader Tuesday about a possible comeback. The
Tennessee Titans, in White's home state, also are interested in the
38-year-old lineman, who retired in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to continue to talk,'' Holmgren told the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer. ''Now his agent will call. I don't know if we
can afford him. But the fact that he phoned me and I love the guy
makes me want to pursue this.''
</P>
<P>
   White played for Holmgren in Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia coach Andy Reid confirmed Wednesday night that he
inquired into White's status. The Eagles are about $7 million under
the salary cap, and are in position to potentially offer White the
most money.
Packers:
</P>
<P>
   Tight end Bubba Franks signed a five-year $6.45 million
contract, putting the first-round pick in training camp just one
day after it began.
</P>
<P>
   Franks' deal includes a $4.67 million signing bonus, said his
agent, Leigh Steinberg. The contract also includes escalator
clauses that will significantly raise the former University of
Miami star's salary if he is among the NFL's top 12 tight ends in
receiving yardage.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a well-thought-out contract, and I'm satisfied with
it,'' said Franks, the 14th overall pick. ''You can see that by the
smile on my face.''
</P>
<P>
   The contract contains five years of escalating salaries ranging
from $275,000 in the first year to $413,000 in the fifth, Steinberg
said.
Redskins:
</P>
<P>
   When the full roster reports for training camp in Ashburn, Va.,
on Thursday, Washington will become the first NFL team to charge
admission for people to watch practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we'll be close to capacity,'' said team president
Steve Baldacci, which means an opening day crowd approaching 7,500.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to charge $10 for admission (people under 12 get in
free) and $10 for parking pushes the professional sports envelope
in the search for creative ways to generate money -- a priority for
the Redskins, given that owner Dan Snyder paid a record $800
million to buy the team last year and will pay his players about
$100 million in salary and bonuses this year.
Bears:
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Shane Matthews, 3-2 last season as a starter before
a hamstring injury ended his season, signed a one-year contract
with Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears did not release terms, but published reports said the
incentive-laden contract could pay as much as $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews, a six-year veteran, was hospitalized with a staph
infection in the spring, but is back to his playing weight of 198
pounds. He will open camp third on the depth chart behind Cade
McNown and Jim Miller.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears also signed third-round draft pick Dez White to a
three-year contract. He caught 90 passes for 1,833 yards in three
years at Georgia Tech.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Primed for Tour Victory  </HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Lance Armstrong has taken nearly
all of the drama out of the final week of the Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's almost inconceivable that Lance Armstrong will lose,''
said Germany's Jan Ullrich, the only rider with a remote chance of
catching the defending champion.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is very strong. I will compete as hard as I can, but
realistically, the battle is for who comes second.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong finished 35th in the 17th stage Wednesday, clocking
the same time in a furious sprint as winner Erik Dekker of the
Netherlands. Ullrich was 29th.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing's changed. My goal's still exactly the same -- to win
the Tour again,'' said Armstrong, the Texas rider who overcame
testicular cancer to win cycling's premier event in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Postal star's position was never threatened throughout
the 96-mile race along the shores of Lake Geneva, as he stayed
within the pack alongside his closest challengers.
</P>
<P>
   Ullrich of Deutsche Telekom remained second, 5 minutes, 37
seconds behind the American with just four stages to go in the race
that ends Sunday in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong and the race's eight other top riders passed a
surprise blood test taken Wednesday in their hotel rooms, the first
test of its kind this year.
</P>
<P>
   It marked the latest step taken by the International Cycling
Union to restore confidence in the integrity of the competition
following the scandal-plagued 1998 race.
</P>
<P>
   The stage winner and the holder of the yellow jersey of overall
leader automatically are given a urine test for
performance-enhancing drugs after each stage.
</P>
<P>
   Dekker had tears in his eyes after winning Wednesday's stage.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was extremely confident because of my previous wins in these
circumstances,'' said Dekker, who had won two split-second finishes
during the three-week race.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once I broke clear I didn't even look back to see what was
going on behind me,'' he said. ''I had no idea who had finished
behind me until I saw the results sheet.''
</P>
<P>
   Dekker edged Erik Zabel of Telekom and little-known Fred
Rodriguez, an American riding for the Italian Mapei team. Fifty-six
racers were credited with Dekker's time.
</P>
<P>
   The riders went from the French southern shore of Lake Geneva
into the nearby foothills of the Alps before a frantic race
downhill to Lausanne, the home of the International Olympic
Committee on the lake's northern shore.
</P>
<P>
   Missing from the pack was Italy's Marco Pantani, the 1998 winner
who withdrew overnight while in 14th place.
</P>
<P>
   Pantani blamed mysterious intestinal pains for his decision.
Other riders suggested it might have more to do with his fading
performance Tuesday during the competition's last major
mountain-climbing stage -- the last real chance for Pantani, a poor
sprinter, to narrow Armstrong's lead before
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who exchanged harsh words with Pantani last week
after allowing him to win a mountain stage, said he shed no tears
about his rival's departure.
</P>
<P>
   He pointedly referred to Pantani as ''the Elephant,'' a nickname
referring to Pantani's ears and a reference that the Italian has
sought to shed in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Elefantino is a different man. I don't think anybody fully
understands his motivations,'' Armstrong said.

<HEADLINE> Attorney General sues contractors for work never completed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   (Binghamton-AP) -- State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer filed
suit against nine home-improvement contractors for allegedly taking
thousands of dollars in repair bills for jobs that were never
completed.
</P>
<P>
   The list of contractors which Spitzer's office named in lawsuits
Wednesday are only a few of the dozens of firms that state
prosecutors insist have taken money for work that was never
completed.

<P>
   In all, Spitzer said his office is seeking more than $200,000 in
compensation for people taken in by fraudulent home improvement
schemes that ran the gamut from driveway repaving outfits to
carpenters who took cash in advance and never followed through.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those cases are handled with out of court settlements
and mediation, prosecutors said, as they issued a warning yesterday
to people thinking about hiring workmen to repave driveways or
replace roofs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very keenly aware in the attorney general's office that
the vast majority of contractors are upstanding, hardworking men
and women,'' Spitzer spokesman Marc Violette said. ''We are dealing
today with the very, very small number of people who give
contractors a bad name.''

<HEADLINE> Filly Wins 16 Straight  </HEADLINE>
By ED SCHUYLER Jr.
<TEXT>
<P>
   She was bought sight unseen, and now Hallowed Dreams is sweet
16, a Cajun horse racing queen.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen wins for the unbeaten 3-year-old filly has tied the
record of consecutive victories held by Citation and Cigar.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Lloyd Romero shrugs off comparisons of his filly with
those two great Thoroughbreds. Such comparisons, of course, are
meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hear that all the time, but that's OK,'' said the former
Louisiana State trooper, who co-owns Hallowed Dreams.
</P>
<P>
   He also scoffs at criticism that all of Hallowed Dreams' starts
have been in Louisiana, where she was bred -- at Evangeline Downs,
Delta Downs, the Fair Grounds and Louisiana Downs, the Bossier City
track at which she could attempt to break the record in late August
or in September.
</P>
<P>
   ''She belongs to the people of Louisiana,'' said Romero, who
hails from Erath in Cajun country. ''That's God's country.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Romero noted, ''I go to the airport and I see that
planes fly both ways. ''They can fly here from New York. They can
fly here from Kentucky. Let them come here and chase her in
103-degree heat.''
</P>
<P>
   Hallowed Dreams has led all the way in all but one of her
starts, none longer than 6&AMP;frac12; furlongs
</P>
<P>
   ''I bought her sight unseen when she was 4-months-old,'' Romero
said. ''Her momma (Pacific Dream) was a pretty good horse. She won
$90,000 when purses were $1,500-$2,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Romero and Johnny Gaspard paid $15,000 for Hallowed Dreams, who
has earned $390,429, and they have turned down an offer of $2
million to sell her.
</P>
<P>
   ''How much money do you need,'' the 65-year-old Romero said.
''It only takes $5,000 to bury a man, and I have $5,000. If it was
just an investment, OK, but racing is game for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're both really blessed,'' Gaspard said.
</P>
<P>
   Not only Hallowed Dreams, but horse training itself, has been
just what the doctor ordered for Romero, whose son, Randy, was a
top jockey. Another son, Gerald, also trains.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have Parkinson's Disease,'' Romero said. ''It gives me
something to go to work for.''
</P>
<P>
   Romero became a full-time trainer in 1977 after surviving an
accident while still a state policemen. A vehicle driven by a drunk
crashed head-on into his patrol car.
</P>
<P>
   Another whose life has been affected by Hallowed Dreams is
41-year-old jockey Sylvester Carmouche, who was suspended for 10
years by Louisiana racing authorities for winning a mile race in
which his mount, Landing Officer, ran less than a quarter-mile at
Delta Downs in January 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The race was run in a heavy fog. The horses started from a chute
and the race took them through the homestretch twice. Landing
Officer got to the finish line 24 lengths ahead of his closest
pursuer for what briefly was his fourth win in 50 starts.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out, however, that shortly after the break, Carmouche
pulled up Landing Officer, and they lurked the near the top of the
stretch in the fog until the rest of the field came around.
</P>
<P>
   Carmouche was reinstated in 1998 with the help of Romero, and he
became Hallowed Dreams' regular rider in her third start.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thank God so much for giving me something like this and Mr.
Lloyd Romero for thinking of me to ride her,'' Carmouche said after
Hallowed Dreams tied Citation and Cigar's record by winning the
Dixie Miss July 15 at Louisiana Downs.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's part of my family,'' Carmouche said. ''She's just like
my wife. I love her.''

   BEIJING (AP) -- A Chinese swimming star plans to challenge the
country's decision to ban her from the Sydney Olympics for alleged
steroid use, a state-run newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Wu Yanyan, world record holder in the women's 200-meter medley,
was barred from competing for four years when she failed a drug

   On Thursday, the Beijing Morning Post quoted Wu as saying she
did not use the drug. She also said that five days before the test,
she passed a similar test given by FINA, the governing body of

<HEADLINE> Bush on Verge of Picking V.P.  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- George W. Bush says he's getting close but
hasn't decided yet who will be his running mate, but he has decided
on a top priority for that choice. ''You want somebody who's not
going to hurt you,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve days before the opening of the national convention that
will formally make him the Republican presidential candidate, Bush
told reporters at an impromptu news conference on Wednesday: ''I
will make up my mind soon.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of Republicans are urging the Texan to sit on his lead
in polls and make a ''safe'' pick, giving greater weight to a
candidate's potential to do harm than his or her prospects for
bolstering the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating and even Dick Cheney -- head of
Bush's search -- have emerged as favorites of the take-no-chances
crowd, though Bush himself has not said whether either is a
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Others mentioned as potential running mates include Govs. Tom
Ridge of Pennsylvania and George Pataki of New York; Sens. Chuck
Hagel of Nebraska, and Fred Thompson and Bill Frist, both of
Tennessee; and Rep. John Kasich of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The two-term Texas governor has winnowed his list and has shared
his thoughts with a small number of advisers, all sworn to secrecy.
He could announce his decision as early as Monday, though he has
not ruled out waiting until the July 31-Aug. 3 Republican
convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview aboard his campaign plane Tuesday night, Bush
openly ruled out two potential candidates -- retired Gen. Colin
Powell and Senator Connie Mack of Florida -- but stopped and smiled
when Cheney's name was mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going there,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican operative Rich Galen said of Cheney, ''He'd be a
smart pick, an elder with gravitas,'' adding that the former
defense secretary's history of heart problems might be a factor.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, the most mentioned running mate
prospects for Al Gore are House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt,
Florida Sen. Bob Graham, Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry and former
Maine Sen. George Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Christopher, head of Gore's selection effort, has been
asking Democratic lawmakers about the idea of picking Mitchell,
party sources say.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in a discussion about the history of vice presidential
selections abroad his plane, said a running mate rarely helps a
ticket because voters size up the presidential candidate, not his
No. 2. On the other hand, a bad or controversial choice can hurt
the ticket, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You want somebody who can do the job, wants the job and is
willing to work for you. You want somebody who's not going to hurt
you,'' Bush said. Asked if history suggested that a ''safe'' pick
is the best route, Bush said yes.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Texas governor was careful not to apply that
history lesson to his selection process. It wasn't clear if he was
tipping his hand or merely ruminating over political theories
during an informal chat. He declined, for example, to say whether
picking an abortion-rights candidate would be a political risk for
his ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge's abortion-rights stance and related feud with Catholic
leaders in Pennsylvania has prompted many Republicans to consider
him a risky -- and increasingly unlikely -- pick.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, another abortion-rights Catholic, is not at odds with
his church leadership, thus has seen his stock rise among GOP
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Bush advisers say their boss could name an abortion-rights
nominee, appealing to moderates, and still retain support of the
party's conservative base. But with the governor holding his own
against Gore, many Republicans say he doesn't need to take the
risk.
</P>
<P>
   ''Safe means that he's going Keating,'' said GOP consultant
Scott Reed, who professes no inside knowledge. Reed, who managed
Bob Dole's 1996 campaign, said this is no time for Bush to start
taking chances.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich and Frist might fall into the ''safe pick'' category, GOP
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bush rolls into the convention ahead five or six (percentage)
points in national polls and with 200 electoral votes solid. The
smart political move is a safe bet, somebody who helps with the
base and somebody who helps with a key coalition,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   A two-term governor, Keating gained national exposure for his
leadership after the Oklahoma City bombing. He is a Catholic who is
opposed to abortion and worked briefly in Washington at the
Treasury and Justice Departments.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the column of do-no-harm there is no better name than
Keating,'' Galen said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Keating are close friends, and the Oklahoma governor
was asked to submit background information to Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Several prominent Republicans have said they don't want the job,
including Powell, Florida Sen. Mack, Arizona Sen. John McCain and
former Missouri Sen. John Danforth.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he took those Republicans at their word ''unless they
signaled otherwise.'' He said Powell and Mack have unequivocally
ruled out the job; he did not offer the same assessment for
Danforth or McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Some House Republicans, either out of support for McCain or
concerns about the Bush's purported short list, have urged Bush to
select McCain, according to sources in the House and close to the
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has suggested to Bush allies that
McCain would take the job, according to GOP officials. But the
Arizona senator's advisers insist Graham is speaking only for
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to Bush and McCain say there have been no formal
or informal discussions about pairing the two. McCain has said he
doesn't want to be on the ticket, though some advisers say he
wouldn't necessarily turn it down. Bush has said he takes McCain at
his word.

<HEADLINE> National League Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Kevin Brown nearly pitched a one-hitter, while Jeff
D'Amico
tossed a five-hit shutout. It can be argued, however, that the NL's
best-pitched game of the night came from Pete Harnisch.
<TEXT>
<P>
   After all, he tossed the first complete-game shutout ever at
hitter-friendly Enron Field.
</P>
<P>
   Harnisch pitched a four-hitter for his second straight complete
game, leading the Cincinnati Reds over the Houston Astros 4-0 on
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Harnisch (3-5) beat his old teammates for the fifth straight
time. In his previous start, he pitched the first complete game at
Coors Field this season and snapped the Reds' string of 103 games
without a complete game.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were a lot of circumstances, they just hit balls at
people and I had good stuff the last couple of times out,''
Harnisch said. ''My breaking ball is better. That's the key, to get
them thinking about the breaking ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown allowed only one hit in eight innings, leaving for a
pinch-hitter as Los Angeles was scored five runs in the eighth
inning of a 9-1 victory over Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amico pitched his first shutout in three years, winning his
fourth consecutive start as Milwaukee beat Pittsburgh 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   In other games, New York beat Montreal 5-3, Chicago topped
Philadelphia 5-4, Arizona edged St. Louis 4-3 and San Diego downed
San Francisco 4-3 in 10 innings. Atlanta and Florida were rained
out.
</P>
<P>
   Harnisch struck out four and walked two in his 11th career
shutout. He has thrown the first back-to-back complete games by a
Reds pitcher since David Wells in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been sharp every game he's pitched,'' Reds manager Jack
McKeon said. ''But the last two times out, this is what we looked
for at the start of the season and didn't have.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last couple of weeks, the other guys have been trying to
follow suit. Maybe he's going to be the guy to look for in the
second half.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Larkin hit a solo homer to fuel a three-run sixth inning,
then tripled in the seventh and scored on a sacrifice fly by Ken
Griffey Jr.
Dodgers 9, Rockies 1:
</P>
<P>
   At Los Angeles, Brown showed no ill effects from the tightness
in his pitching shoulder that caused him to be removed from his
last start.
</P>
<P>
   Brown (9-3) allowed only a first-inning single by Larry Walker
before retiring 23 of the last 24 batters he faced -- including the
final 14. He walked one and struck out eight.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Hansen, making just his 14th start of the season, hit the
first pitch from Rolando Arrojo (5-8) into the right-field seats
after Shawn Green and Eric Karros hit one-out singles in the sixth.
The homer was Hansen's fifth; the previous four came as a pinch
hitter.
Brewers 6, Pirates 0:
</P>
<P>
   At Milwaukee, D'Amico struck out four and walked four.
</P>
<P>
   In his last four starts, he has allowed just one run in 30 2-3
innings, lowering his ERA to 1.87.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amico (6-4) missed all of 1998 and most of last season after
surgery on his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt good in the bullpen,'' said D'Amico, who was on the
disabled list this season from June 7 through June 30 with
tendinitis in his right shoulder. ''I felt strong and was able to
carry it into the game and was able to go out there and put in a
good performance.''
Mets 5, Expos 3:
</P>
<P>
   At Montreal, pinch-hitter Joe McEwing delivered a two-run single
and scored on Derek Bell's single as the Mets rallied in the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Guerrero hit an RBI double that put the Expos ahead 3-2
in the seventh. Bell prevented Montreal from scoring again in the
inning, throwing out Jose Vidro at the plate on Lee Stevens' fly
ball to right field.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Payton and Benny Agbayani singled off reliever Steve Kline
(1-3) to lead off the Mets eighth. Melvin Mora sacrificed, and
McEwing hit a soft single to center.
Cubs 5, Phillies 4:
</P>
<P>
   At Chicago, Sammy Sosa tied the game with an eighth-inning homer
and Brant Brown won it in the ninth by scoring on a wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Gant tied the game off Cubs closer Rick Aguilera with a
leadoff homer in the ninth. A few hours before the game, Cubs team
president Andy MacPhail accepted general manager Ed Lynch's
resignation.
Diamondbacks 4, Cardinals 3:
</P>
<P>
   At Phoenix, Erubiel Durazo hit a two-run double and the Arizona
bullpen pitched four scoreless innings to back up Armando Reynoso
(7-6).
</P>
<P>
   Greg Swindell pitched a perfect seventh and eighth. Matt Mantei
pitched the ninth for his first save since July 9.
Padres 4, Giants 3, 10 innings:
</P>
<P>
   At San Francisco, Ryan Klesko drove in three runs, including the
game-winner in the 10th inning off Alan Embree (1-3) against a
drawn-in infield.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Bonds hit career home run No. 476 in the fourth, moving
into sole possession of 18th place on the all-time list, and ended
the game with a 410-foot fly ball that was caught at the wall in
right-center.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Rebels Release Filipino  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Muslim rebels holding several
dozen hostages in the southern Philippines have released the
teen-age son of a soldier who was killed in a clash with the
rebels, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, Richard Sintos, 17, was taken by helicopter from remote
Jolo island to Zamboanga, a commercial city in the southern
Philippines, Vice Governor Munib Estino said.
</P>
<P>
   Sintos' father died in a clash with the rebels on neighboring
Basilan island, and Sintos was seized afterward. It was unclear why
the teen was near the scene of the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the release, the Abu Sayyaf rebels are still holding
several groups of hostages, including teachers kidnapped from a
Basilan school and 19 mostly foreign hostages nabbed in April at a
Malaysian diving resort. They are believed to have 37 captives in
all -- six French, three Germans, two Finns, two South Africans,
seven Malaysians and 17 Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
   Philippine negotiators are expecting the release of two of the
Basilan teachers and seven Malaysians from the diving resort after
agreeing with the rebels on a ransom amount, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The seven Malaysians were originally scheduled to be freed
Monday, but a last-minute rebel demand for a larger ransom blocked
the release: They asked for $337,500 per person, far more than the
$67,500 per person agreed upon earlier, negotiators said. On
Wednesday, the sides agreed on a revised figure somewhat higher
than the original amount.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the rebels released their first European captive, an
ailing German woman from among the diving resort group.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are demanding $1 million for each remaining European
hostage, negotiators say. The Philippine government has an official
no-ransom policy, but negotiators have confirmed that ransoms were
paid for two Malaysian hostages who were released earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf is the smaller of two main rebel groups fighting
for a separate Islamic nation for the Muslim minority in the
southern Philippines. The group has been accused of a wide range of
kidnappings and attacks on Christians in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators said Ghalib Andang, the Abu Sayyaf commander holding
most of the hostages, is no longer demanding an independent Muslim
nation as a condition for the hostages' release. But other rebel
commanders reportedly continue to demand such a state.

<HEADLINE> Protester Rally Before G-8 Summit  </HEADLINE>
By ERIC TALMADGE
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKINAWA CITY, Japan (AP) -- Thousands of people formed a chain
around a major U.S. air base Thursday to protest the American
military presence ahead of President Clinton's visit for the
weekend's Group of Eight summit.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers claimed to have mobilized more than 25,000 people for
the chain, which stretched 11 miles around Kadena air base, one of
the largest U.S. military installations here.
</P>
<P>
   There was no independent confirmation of the numbers, but it
appeared to be one of the largest anti-base protests in years. In
several areas, the protesters stood three or four deep. Many wore
headbands with anti-base slogans and came with their children.
</P>
<P>
   ''As teachers, we have vowed never to send our students to war
again,'' said Isao Kaneshiro, head of a local teachers' union. ''I
want President Clinton to know that we don't want his troops
here.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate reports of arrests or incidents at the
protest, held as G-8 leaders were to begin arriving on Okinawa for
the annual summit that starts Friday and lasts through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the leaders held bilateral meetings in Tokyo before
flying on to Okinawa. Clinton was to hold a meeting with Japan's
Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori on Thursday, but postponed that at the
last minute because of Mideast peace talks being held in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers stood in for Clinton
Thursday in Tokyo at pre-G-8 meeting with developing countries. He
was accompanied by Gene Sperling, the national economic adviser,
and Lael Brainard, deputy national economic adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The G-8 consists of the United States, Japan, Russia, England,
Italy, Canada, Germany and France. The group has held summits each
year for the past 25 years. This is the fourth summit Japan has
hosted, and the first it has held outside of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   This year's summit was expected to focus on information
technology and ways to alleviate the ''digital divide,'' money
laundering and financial crimes, debt relief for the world's
poorest nations, and the global economy in general.
</P>
<P>
   But the summit was also expected to be heavy on the photo op.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings are to be held at a subtropical, beachside resort
in the city of Nago, on the northern part of Okinawa. Officials
hope it will put Okinawa on the international map for tourism -- its
most important source of income after the military bases.
</P>
<P>
   Among the main activities planned for the leaders is a dinner
and traditional dancing at Shuri Castle, a remnant of the dynasty
that ruled these islands as a kingdom independent from Japan for
nearly three centuries until it was assimilated in the late 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever official topics are discussed, the summit will
almost certainly be overshadowed by Clinton himself.
</P>
<P>
   The focus on Clinton was only heightened by his conspicuous
absence Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would be the first American president to visit Okinawa,
which was governed by Washington after Japan's World War II
surrender until 1972, 20 years after the occupation of the rest of
Japan had ended.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has continued to use Okinawa as a major
military outpost in the Pacific, however.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 30,000 of the 47,000 U.S. troops in Japan are stationed
on Okinawa, including the largest contingent of Marines outside the
United States. Many Okinawans feel that the presence is too heavy,
and want it reduced or eliminated.

<HEADLINE> Barak, Arafat To Keep Talking  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat ended nine days of marathon summit
talks without agreement late Wednesday, but in a dramatic twist
agreed to revive their exhaustive effort to resolve the
half-century-old conflict between their people.
</P>
<P>
   Their decision, which came around midnight Wednesday as
delegation bags were packed and everyone was ready to go, surprised
even President Clinton. ''Nobody wanted to give up,'' he said in
announcing the talks will go on without him while he travels to
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all thought it was over, at least for now,'' Clinton said,
''and we discovered that nobody wanted to quit, nobody wanted to
give up, and that's encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   He cautioned, however, that ''the gaps remain substantial''
between the two sides. ''But there has been progress and we must be
all prepared to go the extra mile,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There should be no illusion about the difficult task ahead,''
the president said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest obstacle to a peace agreement was believed to be the
future of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was staying behind with
Barak and Arafat as Clinton prepared to leave, a day late, for an
international economic conference in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Clinton spoke, Israeli and Palestinian officials
said the two leaders were ready to continue the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The summit will continue with Secretary Albright after
discussions that President Clinton had with both sides in order to
try to reach an agreement,'' a senior Israeli official said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are efforts now to resume the negotiations,'' said
Hassan Abdel Rahman, the Palestine Liberation Organization's
Washington envoy. ''President Arafat is not leaving the stage.''
</P>
<P>
   In the talks shepherded by Clinton, Barak and Arafat could not
come to terms.
</P>
<P>
   ''The summit has come to a conclusion without reaching an
agreement,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said when the
negotiations broke up shortly before 11 p.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the agreement to talk further, there was finger-pointing
on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   No details of the final hang-ups were immediately disclosed, but
Jerusalem was believed to be the main problem. Clinton was
understood to have pressed the two leaders to accept a U.S.-crafted
compromise on Jerusalem's future and other core issues, including
the disposition of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Israelis are responsible for the failure of the summit,''
Rahman said. ''We came to the summit with an open spirit to reach
an agreement, but the Israeli stance was not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''Barak was negotiating with his own (Jewish) settlers, and not
the Palestinians.''
</P>
<P>
   But an Israeli official, Yuli Tamir, told Israel Army Radio,
''I'm very sorry that this summit simply did not come to anything.
It's not because of us but because Arafat did not know how to go
the extra mile.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, in briefing reporters, Lockhart had indicated time was
running out, saying no one saw any value in ''staying on forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met with Arafat even as Lockhart briefed reporters on
the situation. The president had met earlier with Barak. The two
principals in the talks did not meet face to face during the day,
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Arafat were under pressure to find common ground on
such contentious issues as the future of Jerusalem, the fate of 2
million to 4 million Palestinian refugees and their descendants,
the size of a Palestinian state on the West Bank and in Gaza and
the number of Jewish settlements to remain in the territories.
</P>
<P>
   Israel radio and television reported Barak had written to
Clinton complaining that the Palestinians had not gone to Camp
David to negotiate in good faith.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Palestinians arrived at Camp David lacking a true
commitment, and are not ready to have a substantive discussion
about a lasting peace and to make historic decisions,'' Israel
radio quoted a Hebrew translation of the letter. ''Unless there are
last-minute changes, the Palestinians will have to envision the
tragic consequences of an opportunity they missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Rahman sought to rebut the prime minister. The PLO envoy said
the Palestinians went to Camp David to achieve a just and lasting
peace that the Israeli and Palestinian people could live with for
generations.
</P>
<P>
   ''This peace does not deal with balance of forces but balance of
interests,'' Rahman told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   He contended that in the talks Israel sought to impose
settlement terms on the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton made telephone calls to four other leaders
in the Middle East ''to give them some sense of where we are in
this process.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the president had received written communications
from Arafat as well as Barak. He did not describe Arafat's letter,
except that it was different in nature and substance from that
Barak's letter complaining that the Palestinians were not
negotiating in good faith.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why they would send letters to Clinton when they were
sitting in talks with him, Lockhart said that was a question for
them, not him.
</P>
<P>
   He said repeatedly that the sessions couldn't keep going as they
have. ''There comes a time when you have to get on with the other
business that's before you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Jerusalem, Barak signaled before and during the summit that
he was willing to give the Palestinians more control over Arab
neighborhoods and to expand the area beyond the city. In exchange,
Israel would absorb some Jewish settlement into the western part of
the city.
</P>
<P>
   But Rahman, the PLO official, said, ''There can be no agreement
without total Palestinian sovereignty over east Jerusalem. This is
a basic condition for achieving peace.''

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Wahid Shirks Criticism  </HEADLINE>
By SLOBODAN LEKIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesia's difficult transition to
democracy hit a new hurdle Thursday when the embattled president
defiantly shrugged off criticism from angry legislators, saying
they have no power to kick him out of office.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to speculation that a group of lawmakers may try to
impeach him, President Abdurrahman Wahid said he had no intention
of being forced to quit before his five-year term ends in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   ''According to the Constitution, the president ... cannot be
brought down or have action taken against him unless he commits
treason,'' he told the 500-member parliament.
</P>
<P>
   His comments appeared to raise the stakes in a continuing power
struggle between the legislative and executive branches, a central
problem in Indonesia's shift to democratic government. The
parliament, which for decades rubber-stamped former authoritarian
leader Suharto's decrees, has been flexing its muscles since it was
installed last year in multiparty elections.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid was summoned to parliament Thursday to answer allegations
that he wrongly fired two economic ministers in April.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech read by his state secretary, the president said the
dismissal of Trade and Industry Minister Yusuf Kalla and Investment
Minister Laksamana Sukardi was a political decision by the head of
state. He said that under Indonesia's system of government he was
under no obligation to explain his actions to the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   That comment was greeted with booing from the normally
respectful deputies in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's appearance was a prelude to a crucial Aug. 7 session
of the country's highest legislative body, the 700-member Peoples'
Consultative Assembly, during which Wahid is scheduled to deliver
his state-of-the-nation speech.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts have speculated that some Suharto backers and
Muslim hard-liners may try to impeach Wahid, citing a long-running
separatist war in the west, ongoing religious conflict in the east,
a poor economy and other unresolved problems.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid became Indonesia's first freely elected president in four
decades when he was chosen by the assembly last October. There were
high hopes that the respected Muslim leader would deliver sweeping
economic and political reforms to Indonesia after a generation of
dictatorial rule and rampant corruption.
</P>
<P>
   However, Wahid's unruly coalition government and unpredictable
administrative style have galvanized political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The assembly's Aug. 7-18 meeting is expected to trigger protests
by student and human rights groups and about 100,000 political
supporters of various political parties. Authorities plan to deploy
more than 28,000 police, soldiers and civilian guards in the
capital for the session.
</P>
<P>
   During Thursday's parliamentary session, about 500 students
rallied in front of the building, demanding an end to the bloody
separatist war in western Aceh province and the Muslim-Christian
conflict in eastern Maluku province.

<HEADLINE> American League Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark Buehrle sure looked like he'd pitched more than one inning
in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Making his first big league start, the 21-year-old lefty was in
command at the Metrodome as the Chicago White Sox beat Minnesota
3-2 on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was more nervous having lunch with my parents this afternoon
than I was on the mound,'' Buehrle said. ''Once the game started, I
felt fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Buehrle (1-0), promoted from Double-A Birmingham on Sunday, led
the White Sox to their fifth win in a row. He pitched seven
innings, giving up two runs and six hits.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a bit tired in the seventh and I began to rush my
pitches a bit,'' said Buehrle, toweling off after a beer shower
from his teammates. ''I never thought I could get a major league
win this quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   In other AL games, New York defeated Detroit 9-1, Texas held off
Anaheim 3-2, Seattle stopped Oakland 6-3, Toronto beat Tampa Bay
5-2, and Kansas City downed Cleveland 10-5.
</P>
<P>
   Brook Fordyce emerged from 1-for-18 slump with three hits,
including a home run as Chicago took a 3-0 lead after two innings.
</P>
<P>
   ''Getting some runs early certainly helped him,'' manager Jerry
Manuel said. ''But he had a good changeup and he was calm under
pressure. A rookie in his first start going seven solid innings is
more than a manager could have possibly hoped for.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He left the bases loaded twice tonight. That's a lot of poise
for a rookie.''
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox increased their lead in the AL Central to 10&AMP;frac12;
games over Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins had a tough day in the health department.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Jay Canizaro was carried off the field with a
bruised lower leg after a collision with Tony Graffanino.
</P>
<P>
   Also, first base coach Jerry White was hit in the face by Matt
Lawton's helmet after the outfielder threw it down after a flyout.
White remained on the ground for a couple of minutes before being
helped to the bench, was forced to leave and wore a bandage on his
face after the game.
</P>
<P>
Yankees 9, Tigers 1
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens won his fourth straight start since coming off the
disabled list, leading New York over Detroit at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens moved into 35th place on the career win list with No.
255, moving ahead of Jack Morris and Hall of Famer Red Faber.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens struck out 11 and walked none, giving up six hits in
eight innings. It was his 96th career double-digit strikeout game,
fourth on the career list and one behind Sandy Koufax.
</P>
<P>
Rangers 3, Angels 2
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Scarborough Green threw out Scott Spiezio at the
plate to end the game at Anaheim, stopping Texas' three-game losing
streak.
</P>
<P>
   Spiezio was on second base with two outs when Kevin Stocker
singled. Green, inserted for defensive purposes, fielded the ball
and threw on the fly to catcher Ivan Rodriguez, who made the tag.
</P>
<P>
   Spiezio and Angels manager Mike Scioscia argued the call by
plate umpire Doug Eddings.
</P>
<P>
Royals 10, Indians 5
</P>
<P>
   Dave McCarty hit his first career grand slam and Johnny Damon
had a three-run homer as Kansas City beat Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Zaun also homered for the Royals, who won two in a row for
the first time since June 28-29. Jim Thome hit two home runs for
the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The 421st consecutive sellout crowd at Jacobs Field made the
Indians the first team to surpass 2 million in home attendance this
season.
</P>
<P>
Mariners 6, Athletics 3
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Moyer won his fourth straight start at the Oakland
Coliseum as Seattle defeated the Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners closer Kazuhiro Sasaki struck out the side in the ninth
for his 23rd save. A's starter Kevin Appier is 0-4 in his last five
starts.
</P>
<P>
Blue Jays 5, Devil Rays 2
</P>
<P>
   Kelvim Escobar pitched two-hit ball for eight innings and
Toronto won at SkyDome.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Fullmer homered and drove in three runs. The Blue Jays have
homered in 18 straight games -- the major league record is 25 by
Atlanta (1998), Detroit (1994) and the Yankees (1941).

<HEADLINE> Oklahoma Executes Convicted Killer  </HEADLINE>
By KELLY KURT
<TEXT>
<P>
   McALESTER, Okla. (AP) -- A man who killed five people during a
1989 spree across four states was executed by injection early
Thursday for murdering a 31-year-old woman in her parents' floral
shop.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Francis Braun, 39, received the death penalty for shooting
and killing Gwendolyn Sue Miller, 31, in Ardmore.
</P>
<P>
   Braun apologized repeatedly before his death, naming his victims
one by one.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sorry I murdered you . . . I'm sorry I took your lives,''
he said. He apologized to the victims' families, also naming them
one by one, and to his own family, whom he requested not attend.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I did was unforgivable, but I ask you to forgive me,'' he
said. ''Save me, Mother Mary, from the eternal damnation I
deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the execution, Miller's husband, Dusty, said: ''I can't
forgive him tonight. Maybe I can sometime down the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days before Mrs. Miller's slaying, Braun, a 28-year-old
college graduate with a degree in criminal justice went to a Garden
City, Kan., convenience store to rob it. He killed the clerk out of
fear she could identify him and went to another store and killed
another employee.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of Barbara Kochendorfer and Mary Rains were found on
a rural road. They left eight young children.
</P>
<P>
   On July 20, 1989, Braun shot E.P. ''Pete'' Spurrier while
robbing a Pampa, Texas, photo development store. He killed
Geraldine Valdez three days later at a Springer, N.M., convenience
store, telling a deputy ''it wasn't as good as shooting craps in
Vegas, but it was all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Braun received life sentences for the murders in Kansas, New
Mexico and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Braun's father, Lelyn Braun, a prominent Garden City lawyer at
the time of the murders, blamed cocaine and other drugs for making
Braun go ''completely bonkers.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's very beautiful, God-fearing, prepared to meet his
creator,'' Braun said, describing his son now. ''He's found peace
with God.''

<HEADLINE> 'West Wing' Among Emmy Contenders  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The White House is taking on the mob, with
the drama ''The West Wing'' and the gritty Mafia series ''The
Sopranos'' among the favorites for the 52nd Annual Primetime Emmy
nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Contenders for the fall awards ceremony were to be announced
Thursday by Emmy winners Edie Falco (''The Sopranos'') and Michael
Badalucco (''The Practice'') at the Academy of Television Arts &AMP;
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Both ''The Sopranos'' and ''The West Wing'' were honored this
year with Peabody awards, which recognize television excellence,
while ''The West Wing'' received top awards last week from the
Television Critics Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Sopranos'' was the top nominee last year with 16 bids, but
the cable series about a suburban mobster lost the best drama prize
to ''The Practice.'' This year, ''The West Wing,'' a more
mainstream show about idealistic politicians, could fare better.
</P>
<P>
   Among comedy series, Emmy voters have the chance to rectify last
year's snub of ''Will &AMP; Grace,'' the sophomore sitcom about a gay
man-straight woman palship. A scrappy newcomer, ''Malcolm in the
Middle,'' may have an outside shot at a nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ally McBeal'' won the best comedy series award last year.
</P>
<P>
   Nominees will face a revised judging system. In a bid to
energize the awards, the academy is dispensing with blue-ribbon
voting panels that required a weekend spent viewing tapes at a
hotel and tended to draw older academy members.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, judges will be allowed to watch the nominated shows on
their own.
</P>
<P>
   The academy is experimenting with the approach in the top
categories that are part of the Emmy broadcast. Last year, the show
drew its lowest ratings since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ''You may see programs win that traditionally have been seen as
too avant garde or too edgy for the academy,'' said academy
President James B. Chabin. ''What we're trying to do is throw the
doors open and bring in a new generation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sept. 10 awards ceremony will air on ABC with actor-comedian
Garry Shandling as host. Executive producer Don Mischer said the
show will emphasize comedy.

<HEADLINE> GOP Sends Clinton Less Costly Cut  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Upping the ante in their tax cut confrontation
with President Clinton, congressional Republicans have agreed to
send him a less costly version of their bill to eliminate the
marriage penalty tax in hopes of making a threatened veto more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to get something on his desk that's signable,'' said
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, which the House and Senate are aiming to
pass Thursday, millions of married couples would get some tax
relief this calendar year, but their total tax cut would be lower
than the amounts in earlier GOP bills.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary estimates put the bill's total revenue cost at about
$89 billion over five years. That compares with a 10-year, $248
billion version passed Tuesday by the Senate, and the House's
competing bill costing $182 billion over 10 years. A 10-year
estimate for the compromise was not available, but the agreement is
closer to the House version.
</P>
<P>
   If the compromise passes both houses of Congress this week, the
president would be forced to decide whether to sign or veto the
bill before the end of the Republican National Convention, which
starts July 31. Clinton had made his approval conditional upon
Congress passing an acceptable prescription drug benefit plan for
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, in Iowa on Wednesday campaigning for
president, said he remained opposed to the Republican measure.
</P>
<P>
   ''I support eliminating the marriage penalty but what this bill
does goes way beyond that and cuts taxes on people who are not
affected by the current provisions of the law and affects people
who are not married at all and is very, very expensive in terms of
the amount of money that would have to be made up in other ways
that would end up raising taxes in the future on people who can
least afford to shoulder that burden,'' Gore said in a KCRG-TV
forum with voters.
</P>
<P>
   Elimination of the tax code's marriage penalty, in which an
estimated 25 million couples pay more than they would if single, is
the centerpiece of the GOP's election-year tax cut agenda. The
Republicans' decision to send Clinton a less costly bill comes as
the White House has stepped up criticism that huge GOP tax cuts
could rapidly deplete the budget surplus even as government revenue
projections rise.
</P>
<P>
   The White House chief of staff, John Podesta, said in a letter
Wednesday to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., that an
estimated $700 billion in GOP tax cuts and spending bills that
exceed Clinton's request represented a ''huge spending binge'' in
an election year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now is not the time to abandon responsible budgeting by
spending money before it even comes in the door,'' Podesta said.
''We can cut taxes for the middle class, while maintaining fiscal
discipline and making critical investments in our future.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement gradually would enlarge the bottom 15 percent
income tax bracket for all married couples so that it is equal to
that of two single people. Under current law, two single people pay
the lower 15 percent rate on a greater share of their income than a
married couple.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate-passed enlargement of the next-highest 28 percent tax
bracket was dropped, partly to reduce White House claims that the
bill is skewed toward higher-income couples.
</P>
<P>
   That change would be effective on Oct. 1 of this year, much
quicker than in either of the previous versions and a month before
this year's election.
</P>
<P>
   Another change taking effect Oct. 1 would be adjustment of the
standard income tax deduction for married couples so that it is
equal to that of two single people. This year, that would increase
a married couple's deduction from $7,350 to $8,800.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement would also lift the income cap by $2,500 for
lower-income couples who claim the earned income tax credit, and
ensure through 2004 that married couples could claim personal tax
credits, such as the $500 per-child credit, without getting
entangled in the complex alternative minimum tax.
</P>
<P>
   Because the bill is governed by five-year budget rules, all of
the changes would phase out on Dec. 31, 2004. That means a future
Congress would have to make the tax cut permanent, or married
couples would get hit with a tax increase in 2005.

<HEADLINE> Reality TV Trend Disturbs Some  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- I have this queasy feeling about ''Survivor''
and ''Big Brother'' and it isn't because of something the
contestants ate.
</P>
<P>
   Let the islanders feast on grilled rat; not my problem as long
as Rodent-On-A-Bun doesn't pop up on menus.
</P>
<P>
   And I'm not upset anymore by the fact that the shows, with
European pedigrees, veered dangerously close to un-American. The
dippy ''Big Brother'' and its dumb logo are annoyingly reminiscent
of a Mentos commercial, a bland, Eurogeneric type of ad designed
for international efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   In America's Manifest Destiny style, we have made the genre our
own, pitting young against old, men against women, black against
white.
</P>
<P>
   What really disturbs me is that these so-called reality shows
imperil the dramas and comedies that make TV a magic box.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I know, television's a big tent for a big country, with
room for wrestling, game shows and, maybe, Laura Schlessinger. TV's
roots lie not only in the esteemed ''Playhouse 90,'' but in ''Queen
for a Day,'' that midcentury marvel in which tragic housewives wept
for prizes.
</P>
<P>
   But with viewers entranced by ''Survivor'' shenanigans and
network executives bewitched by the ratings, it's difficult not to
fret.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasters are battling for survival in a gazillion-channel
world, and anything goes. Why should ABC stick with low-rated
''Sports Night'' when it can clone Regis and another
''Millionaire'' for instant gratification?
</P>
<P>
   ''Do I hope the trend goes away in a hurry? Sure,'' said Aaron
Sorkin, creator of ''The West Wing'' and ''Sports Night'' and one
of the wizards of TV fiction. ''There isn't a writer writing that
thing ('Survivor'), so who wants it on television?''
</P>
<P>
   Sorkin's acclaimed White House drama has a home at NBC, where
programming executives are wearing sackcloth and ashes for failing
to capitalize on the reality trend.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are network heads who are getting jumped up and down on
right now for not getting on the reality bandwagon,'' Sorkin told
reporters recently. ''I wish they were being applauded instead.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, NBC has assembled a crisis team to review the literally
hundreds of reality pitches pouring in and find the real cubic
zirconia among them.
</P>
<P>
   One leading candidate: ''Chains of Love'' (based on a European
program, natch), in which a woman is bound to four men who will be
discarded one by one until only her Prince Charming, or something
reasonably close, remains.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to abandon what I think is the hallmark of our
network -- quality dramas and sitcoms -- but we can't ignore this
(reality trend) as something that may go away a year from now or
two years from now,'' NBC West Coast President Scott Sassa said
this week.
</P>
<P>
   How reassuring.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, dizzy with the continued success of ''Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire,'' is stalking more nonfiction shows.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Chase'' is one, a brainchild of Matt Damon and Ben Affleck
that asks viewers to track down a player let loose somewhere in the
country. Sounds like the Oscar-winning pair (''Good Will Hunting'')
saves their best work for the movies.
</P>
<P>
   Over at Fox, with painful memories of ''Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire?'' receding, it's full steam ahead. Possible new
shows include ''I Want a Divorce,'' in which couples saying ''I
don't anymore'' compete for community property.
</P>
<P>
   CBS, for its part, is already planning another ''Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   If reality shows were confined to the rerun season, that would
be OK. But ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' roared out of summer
1999 and now occupies a hefty chunk of ABC's primetime real estate.
</P>
<P>
   Imitation is the sincerest form of television, the late satirist
Fred Allen observed, so it's not farfetched to worry about reality
growing to frightening proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, dazzled by tribal warfare on ''Survivor'' and by ''Big
Brother'' contestant Karen dissing her absent spouse, viewers can
be distracted from the pleasures of well-told stories.
</P>
<P>
   But what do you really want to pull out of your TV memory bank:
a snapshot of Karen whining, or one of George Clooney sweeping
Julianna Margulies off her feet for keeps on ''ER''?
</P>
<P>
   And take a moment to appreciate what goes into the making of
reality vs. fiction. While the geniuses at ''Chains of Love''
debate chain length, Sorkin is orchestrating a new ''West Wing''
season that will riff on civil liberties, gun violence and the
inner lives of its fascinating characters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think people want something good to chew on,'' Robin Green,
an executive producer on ''The Sopranos,'' said during a recent
tribute to the brilliant HBO mob drama.

   Bet she doesn't mean charred rat.

<HEADLINE> MTV Spends Summer at the Beach  </HEADLINE>
By CHELSEA J. CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Sitting on an ice chest decked out in beach
wear, Dave Holmes looks more the Southern California surfer dude
than MTV host from New York City.
</P>
<P>
   That's just the way he wants it.
</P>
<P>
   ''New York City? Hot. Stuck in a building all day. San Diego?
Great weather. Days at the beach,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   So he gladly accepted the temporary gig as the West Coast host
of MTV's increasingly popular ''SoCal Summer,'' a mixture of
original programming, including talk shows and dance competitions,
which broadcasts daily from San Diego's Mission Beach at 10 a.m.
EDT.
</P>
<P>
   For the past five years, MTV has relocated its studio base from
its New York headquarters in Times Square to a picturesque local
beach house during the summer. Destinations have included Seaside
Heights, N. J., and Paradise Island, Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   This year, MTV chose a defunct beach front bar and restaurant to
serve as its studio, redesigning the building to resemble a beach
house.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, the houses mostly served as exotic scenery to
introduce music videos.
</P>
<P>
   But the set up this year at Mission Beach, with its backdrop of
sunbathers, surfers and the Giant Dipper roller coaster, has
signaled a change in the music channel's approach to summer
programming.
</P>
<P>
   ''San Diego is really hip,'' Holmes says. ''It's like Greenwich
Village by the shore. It's a great choice for MTV.''
</P>
<P>
   With fare aimed at young viewers out of school for the summer,
MTV's summer ratings have steadily increased.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the success, Holmes says, is the shift in music.
</P>
<P>
   ''We went through a dark period in the 1990s. The music was
dark, and the videos, of course, were dark,'' he says. ''But now
it's fun again. It's fun to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   And fun is the key ingredient for MTV's summer programming,
which includes:
</P>
<P>
   --''Mandy'': A talk show featuring as host singer Mandy Moore,
the latest Britney Spears incarnation, who chats it up with young
celebrity guests on a variety of topics, ranging from dating to
beauty tips.
</P>
<P>
   --''Sisqo's Shakedown'': A dance competition with beach party
vibe with Sisqo, formerly of the rap group Dru Hill, as host.
</P>
<P>
   --''Mission: Makeover'': MTV's ''House of Style'' host Molly Sims
oversees makeovers of locals who want to change their image.
</P>
<P>
   --''Say What? Karaoke'': A game show with Holmes as host that
features contestants who sing along to their favorite music videos
for a panel of celebrity judges.
</P>
<P>
   --''Hot Zone'': A daily dose of celebrity and entertainment news,
featuring guests and well-known Southern California entertainment
locales.
</P>
<P>
   What makes ''SoCal Summer'' programming appealing for viewers,
says supervising producer Mike Powers, is the ''real kids'' factor.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every shot filmed for MTV at the beach features local
teens and young adults.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are real kids who come out to be on the shows. They are
all from here. They're not all beautiful people,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But Powers admits that all of the dancers and many of the teens
featured in background shots were cast in the roles. The exception
is the game show, which holds auditions for potential contestants.
</P>
<P>
   One a recent day, Holmes took to the boardwalk, hitting surfer
hangouts and the beach to film segments about music videos that
didn't make the cut on MTV's powerhouse ''Total Request Live,''
where viewers vote for their favorite videos and ''TRL'' -- as its
known to fans -- counts down the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   As he strolls down the beach, Holmes is ogled by teens and
stared at by perplexed senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who's he?'' asks one older woman. ''Should I know him from
somewhere?''
</P>
<P>
   But 18-year-old Jim Dubina of Phoenix needs no introduction.
</P>
<P>
   ''Can I have your autograph?'' he asks Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   The MTV video jockey happily scrawls his name across a small,
white piece of paper.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes, who has been with MTV for two years, hands the autograph
back and asks Dubina if he's having fun at the beach this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Totally,'' the teen-ager says.
</P>

   POINT OF VIEW: The PBS series ''P.O.V.'' turns the camera on
Appalachia and the 1967 slaying of filmmaker Hugh O'Connor, shot as
a trespasser while making a documentary about the war on poverty.
Filmmaker Elizabeth Barret uses the killing as a basis for
examining the relationship between media, public knowledge and
private dignity and also to look at Appalachia's place in the
American imagination. ''Stranger With a Camera'' airs 10 p.m. EDT
Tuesday, July 11.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks surged higher in early trading Thursday
as investors poured back into the markets seeking bargains after
two days of losses.

<P>
   After the first 15 minutes of trading, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 93.69 at 10,789.77.

   Among broader market indicators, the Nasdaq composite index was

<HEADLINE> WW II Memorial Targeted Again  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Opponents challenging the design and location
of a planned World War II monument renewed their efforts today to
keep it off the grand sweep between the Capitol and the Lincoln
Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the U.S. Fine Arts Commission met to consider the
design, Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of Columbia's delegate
in Congress, urged that the monument be moved from the National
Mall to a site alongside. That site, now called Constitution
Gardens, was considered earlier but rejected by the commission as
not prominent enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''It should not cross our collective minds to interrupt the
glorious and near-sacred space between the Washington Monument and
the Lincoln Memorial with any man-made object,'' Norton told a news
conference. It was not World War II veterans who chose the site,
she noted.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton dedicated the Mall site five years ago, but no
ground has been broken. Opposition to the site sprang up as
discussions of the project's design and size progressed.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Scott Feldman, the architectural historian among the
leaders of the opposition, objects to two arches -- one representing
the Atlantic theater of war and the other the Pacific. She said
they were triumphal arches that were traditional symbols of
European tyranny.
</P>
<P>
   She spoke recently with architect Friedrich St. Florian, who won
the design competition for the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   ''What struck me most is that four years later, he still doesn't
know what the message is,'' she said Wednesday. ''We in America
take people -- Washington, Lincoln, Jefferson -- and they become
symbols. His columns look like a battle graveyard in France. They
could be in Arlington cemetery.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Florian's 56 columns, each 17 feet high, would flank the
small Rainbow Pool next to the Reflecting Pool that stretches in
front of the Lincoln Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Two big fountains would be reactivated in the Rainbow Pool,
named because rainbows were seen in the spray when they were first
turned on. The main jets would rise twice as high as the columns,
with a sculptured and illuminated ''Torch of Freedom'' between
them.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rainbows will still be there,'' St. Florian said.
</P>
<P>
   He told reporters earlier this week that the message would be
clear: the victory of democracy over tyranny.
</P>
<P>
   The National Coalition to Save Our Mall contends the site
belongs to the Lincoln Memorial and should remained untouched. It
wants to leave the space clear between the Lincoln Memorial and the
Washington Monument, which stretch in a line toward the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The group cites architect Henry Bacon, who worked on the plan
for the area a century ago. Bacon wrote of the Capitol, the
Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial, then still unbuilt.
</P>
<P>
   ''All three of these structures,'' he said, 'stretching in one
grand sweep from Capitol Hill to the Potomac River, will lend, one
to the others, the associations and memories connected with each,
and each will have its value increased by being on one axis and
having visual relation to the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of new monument say the National Mall should not be
seen as belonging just to the 1800s, and that World War II was the
greatest event of the 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   The World War II monument would be financed by $100 million
being collected from private contributors.

<HEADLINE> Congress Debates Marriage Tax Cut  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Upping the ante in their tax cut confrontation
with President Clinton, congressional Republicans on Thursday
prepared to pass a less costly five-year version of their bill to
eliminate the marriage penalty tax in hopes of making a threatened
veto more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to get something on his desk that's signable,'' said
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, which the House and Senate were aiming to
pass Thursday, millions of married couples would get some tax
relief this calendar year, but the total revenue cost of $89.8
billion over five years is lower than amounts in earlier GOP bills.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee, however, produced an
estimate showing that the new version was still too expensive at
$280 billion over 10 years, even more than the 10-year, $248
billion version that passed the Senate earlier this week. An
official 10-year cost estimate for the bill was not available, and
Republicans were undeterred.
</P>
<P>
   ''This agreement means that we will give President Clinton every
reason to sign the bill into law and help end the marriage
penalty,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House
Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   If the compromise passes both houses of Congress this week, the
president would be forced to decide whether to sign or veto the
bill before the end of the Republican National Convention, which
starts July 31. Clinton had made his approval conditional upon
Congress passing an acceptable prescription drug benefit plan for
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, in Iowa on Wednesday campaigning for
president, said he remained opposed to the Republican measure, in
part because it is ''very, very expensive'' and could benefit
people who don't need it.
</P>
<P>
   Elimination of the tax code's marriage penalty, in which an
estimated 25 million couples pay more than they would if single, is
the centerpiece of the GOP's election-year tax cut agenda. The
Republicans' decision to send Clinton a less costly bill comes as
the White House has stepped up criticism that huge GOP tax cuts
could rapidly deplete the forecast budget surplus even as
government revenue projections rise.
</P>
<P>
   The White House chief of staff, John Podesta, said in a letter
Wednesday to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., that an
estimated $700 billion in GOP tax cuts and spending bills that
exceed Clinton's request represent a ''huge spending binge'' in an
election year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now is not the time to abandon responsible budgeting by
spending money before it even comes in the door,'' Podesta said.
''We can cut taxes for the middle class, while maintaining fiscal
discipline and making critical investments in our future.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement gradually would enlarge the bottom 15 percent
income tax bracket for all married couples so that it is equal to
that of two single people. Under current law, two single people pay
the lower 15 percent rate on a greater share of their income than a
married couple.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate-passed enlargement of the next-highest 28 percent tax
bracket was dropped, partly to reduce White House claims that the
bill is skewed toward higher-income couples.
</P>
<P>
   That change would be effective for the 2000 tax year, much more
quickly than in either of the previous versions and a month before
the election.
</P>
<P>
   Another change taking effect in the 2000 tax year would be
adjustment of the standard income tax deduction for married couples
so that it is equal to that of two single people. This year, that
would increase a married couple's deduction from $7,350 to $8,800.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement would also lift the income cap by $2,000 for
lower-income couples who claim the earned income tax credit, and
ensure through 2004 that married couples could claim personal tax
credits, such as the $500-per-child credit, without getting
entangled in the complex alternative minimum tax.
</P>
<P>
   Because the bill is governed by five-year budget rules, all of
the changes would phase out on Dec. 31, 2004. That means a future
Congress would have to make the tax cut permanent, or married
couples would get hit with a tax increase in 2005.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks surged higher in early trading Thursday
as investors poured back into the markets seeking bargains after
two days of losses.
</P>
<P>
   In midmorning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 143.90 at 10,839.98.

   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 17.53 at 1,499.49, and the Nasdaq composite index

</P>
<P>
   The markets also took comfort from comments by Federal Reserve
Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, who said in testimony before a
Senate committee that the economy is showing signs of slowing.
</P>
<P>
   Investors shrugged off indications by Greenspan that the Fed is
still concerned with the specter of rising inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were up across the board, led by fiber-optics
company SDL Inc., up $53.641 to $413.266. The company is being
acquired by parts maker JDS Uniphase.
</P>
<P>
   JDS Uniphase shares also soared, rising $17.375 to $124.125, on
news the company is being added to the benchmark S&AMP;P 500 index.
</P>
<P>
   Computer maker IBM reported better-than-expected earnings after
the market closed Wednesday. Investors flocked to the stock,
pushing it up $9.844 to $114.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's earnings was apparently the catalyst for the shift in
momentum because Wednesday's selloff, which saw the Nasdaq Stock
Market lose 122 points and the Dow Jones industrial average fall 44
points, was spurred by disappointed investors who sold the shares
of tech companies that didn't live up to high earnings
expectations.

<HEADLINE> Clean-Air Settlement Announced  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Oregon-based wood products company will pay
a $11.2 million fine -- the largest of its kind -- to the government
under a Clean Air Act settlement announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement with Willamette Industries, announced jointly by
Attorney General Janet Reno and Environmental Protection Agency
Administrator Carol Browner, is part of a continuing series of
Clean Air Act enforcement initiatives by the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clean air is one of our most precious possessions, and we
cannot take it for granted,'' Reno told her weekly news conference.
''Dirty air is just plain unhealthy, it's uncomfortable, especially
for our elderly, our children and others who are most vulnerable
among us.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the ''landmark settlement'' with Willamette ''will
help reduce emissions and protect our air quality.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement requires Willamette to pay $11.2 million -- the
largest penalty ever assessed for factory emissions of air
pollution. And it also requires the company to install $74 million
worth of pollution control equipment at its factories across the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Willamette Industries for comment were not
immediately successful.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was contained in a consent decree that was being
filed Thursday in Portland, Oregon. It covers 13 factories in four
states: Oregon, South Carolina, Louisiana and Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the Clean Air Act ''required Willamette to install
pollution control equipment each time it expanded its factories,
which produce plywood and other building products. But we believe
that Willamette did not follow the law. And as a result, thousands
of tons of pollution were illegally released into the air.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the settlement was the third of its kind ''and the
largest in our ongoing effort to make sure that the entire wood
products industry complies with the Clean Air Act.''
</P>
<P>
   Browner told reporters EPA officials estimate ''cleaning up the
emissions from these plants will keep an average of 27,000 tons of
pollution out of the air. That is the equivalent of taking 287,000
cars off the road; 287,000 cars is approximately the number of cars
in the city the size of Portland.''
</P>
<P>
   A leading environmental group welcomed Thursday's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ''We applaud the administration for vigorously enforcing the
Clean Air Act and for holding a polluter accountable,'' said Ed
Hopkins, a spokesman for the Sierra Club. ''We think it's important
for the EPA to send a signal to polluters that they need to comply
with the act -- and this is a big signal.''

'We will pay you $10 to come to church'
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRYAN, Texas (AP) -- Every Sunday morning, the Rev. Rick
Sebastian cruises around the missions, cheap motels and housing
projects of this southeast Texas town in a big blue bus emblazoned
with this plea: ''We will pay you $10 to come to church on our
bus.''
</P>
<P>
   Sebastian, minister at New Life in Christ, acknowledges the
message is a gimmick, but feels strongly about his cause.
</P>
<P>
   ''It gets them into church, and if we can get them into church
where they can hear the word of God, their lives can be changed,''
Sebastian told the Houston Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   When someone accepts his offer, Sebastian drives them to his
small, nondenominational church where the choir is made up of his
wife, Patricia, and two other women. They're backed up by the
church orchestra: a youth minister on the guitar and one drummer.
</P>
<P>
   Sebastian, who is from Detroit, said he's been preaching most of
his life. A few years ago, his ministry duties took him to
Jacksonville, Fla., where the idea of paying people to attend
church was first born in his mind. Back then, he paid $5.
</P>
<P>
   In Bryan, most people turn down Sebastian's offer. But since he
started a few months ago, some have come forward.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm looking for a blessing,'' said Bernie Kindred, 49, as he
climbed into the air-conditioned bus on a recent Sunday. ''Oh, I
can use the $10, but I'm looking for a blessing, too.''

Senate candidate joins critics of Nazi, Confederate flag burnings
</P>
<P>
   RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Democratic Senate candidate Ed Bernstein
joined critics of the Jewish Defense League's burning of Nazi and
Confederate flags in Reno, a demonstration against hatred that
divided the local civil rights and Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   The militant Jewish group burned the flags in front of the
federal courthouse where five self-described white supremacists
pleaded guilty last week to charges in an attempted firebombing at
a Reno synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein added his voice to concerns also raised by civil
rights groups and the rabbi of Temple Emanu-El, which was slightly
damaged in the attack in November.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would have preferred to see the Jewish Defense League
working in an education process instead of a process that attempts
to inflame,'' said Bernstein, a Las Vegas lawyer active in the
Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   Irv Rubin, international chairman of the Jewish Defense League
based in Los Angeles, led the flag-burning.
</P>
<P>
   He urged Jews to arm themselves against a growing number of
attacks across the country, including firebombings at three Jewish
temples in Sacramento in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Bernstein, regional director of the Anti-Defamation
League in San Francisco, said the Jewish Defense League is a fringe
group that does not represent the Jewish community.
Survey reports Protestant clergy favor Bush
</P>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- A market research firm's survey of 518 U.S.
Protestant ministers indicates 50 percent definitely plan to vote
for Republican George W. Bush and another 14 percent probably will.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison Research, which specializes in work for evangelical
broadcasters and other nonprofit groups, mailed surveys in May to a
random sample of clergy. It said the response rate was 16 percent
and the margin of error was 4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The survey did not ask about Pat Buchanan or Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   Among clergy in National Council of Churches denominations, Bush
edged Democrat Al Gore only by 35 to 34 percent with 31 percent
undecided. Bush led strongly among those outside the council.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had only 51 percent support among registered Democrats,
with 32 percent undecided. Among independents, Bush led Gore by 41
to 18 percent with 41 percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had 72 percent backing among self-described political
liberals but they were only 13 percent of the clergy. Bush carried
moderates and conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Sellers, Ellison's president, cautioned that while clergy
have influence, congregants might have different opinions.	   
United Methodists elect African-American and women bishops
</P>
<P>
   NASHVILLE (AP) -- Seven of the 13 new bishops elected this month
in the predominantly white United Methodist denomination are
African-American -- and three are women.
</P>
<P>
   The move follows the election of the Rev. Vashti McKenzie as the
first female bishop in the African Methodist Episcopal Church.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Leontine Kelly became the first African-American woman
to become a United Methodist bishop. ''It is great to no longer be
the 'only,''' Kelly told the United Methodist News Service. ''I am
proud that across the church there has been a response to the
diversity in the church in the election of three very strong women
to the episcopacy.''
</P>
<P>
   The denomination has 8.4 million members in the United States,
including about 382,000 black members. Active bishops on the
council include one Korean-American and two Mexican-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The church's Book of Discipline says jurisdictional conference
delegates, in electing bishops, ''shall give due consideration to
the inclusiveness of the United Methodist Church with respect to
sex, race and national origin.''
Women missionaries at Mormon Temple Square have new dress code
</P>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Floral prints are out and light blouses
with dark skirts are in for the 185 women missionaries who greet
visitors at the Mormon church's Temple Square in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   The new dress code is meant to ''make it easier ... to identify
sister missionaries,'' Michael Purdy, a spokesman for The Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not a uniform,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Purdy said the church will pick up the tab for ''those sister
missionaries who would be burdened by the cost of purchasing any
needed clothing to meet this modified dress code.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, male missionaries wear white shirts and dark suits.
</P>
<P>
   Women's clothing ''should be consistent with their sacred
calling,'' the instructions say. It should be ''Sunday clothes,''
more professional than casual. Nylon hose and calf-length skirts
are a must. No open-toed shoes or T-shirts.
</P>

Baptist to head Methodist-affiliated school
</P>
<P>
   MITCHELL, S.D. (AP) -- Robert Duffett, a Baptist, has taken the
reins at Methodist-affiliated Dakota Wesleyan University.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think in the era we're in now, in this postmodern world with
different ideological views, people are interested in authentic
Christianity, not the brand names,'' Duffett said.
</P>
<P>
   Duffett, 45, the former provost and academic dean at Ottawa
University in Kansas, succeeds Jack Ewing, who has been named
president at Mount Union College in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Duffett, the university's 19th president, said he likes to focus
on similarities between the denominations: ''You can go to
McDonald's, Burger King or Wendy's, but they all sell hamburgers.''
</P>
<P>
   He does plan to join a local Methodist church to strengthen his
tie to the denomination and the university.
Advocates for Catholic women celebrate Mary Magdalene
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- FutureChurch, an organization advocating women
in the Roman Catholic priesthood, is among groups organizing prayer
services in dozens of U.S. cities Saturday to honor St. Mary
Magdalene on her feast day.
</P>
<P>
   This is the third year of such celebrations, which are also held
in Canada and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Christine Schenk, FutureChurch's executive director, says
that ''learning about Jesus' remarkable inclusion of women despite
strong cultural prohibitions of the time can inspire all of us to
redouble our efforts to end the systematic inequality of women in
the church.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 131; Nasdaq Adds 104  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks surged higher Thursday as investors
poured back into the markets seeking bargains after two days of
losses.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 130.82 at 10,826.90.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 12.91 at 1,494.87, and the Nasdaq composite index
was up 103.59 at 4,159.22.
</P>
<P>
   The markets also took comfort from comments by Federal Reserve
Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, who said in testimony before a
Senate committee that the economy is showing signs of slowing.
</P>
<P>
   However, investors shrugged off indications by Greenspan that
the Fed is still concerned with the specter of rising inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were up across the board, led by fiber-optics
company SDL Inc., up $49 to $408.625. The company is being acquired
by parts maker JDS Uniphase.
</P>
<P>
   JDS Uniphase shares also soared, rising $16.75 to $123.50, on
news the company is being added to the benchmark S&AMP;P 500 index.
</P>
<P>
   Computer maker IBM reported better-than-expected earnings after
the market closed Wednesday. Investors flocked to the stock,
pushing it up $9.782 to $113.938.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's earnings was apparently the catalyst for the shift in
momentum because Wednesday's selloff, which saw the Nasdaq Stock
Market lose 122 points and the Dow Jones industrial average fall 44
points, was spurred by disappointed investors who sold the shares
of tech companies that didn't live up to high earnings
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 499.01 million
shares, well ahead of Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 5.30 at 533.16.

<HEADLINE> In-Flight Cell Phone Ban Urged  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- There is no hard proof that cell phones and
other electronic devices pose safety risks on aircraft, but bans on
their use should continue as a precautionary measure, experts told
Congress Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are preventing the extremely remote event,'' the Federal
Aviation Administration's Thomas McSweeny said at a House
Transportation subcommittee hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers said the public is confused about rules airlines
impose on the use of such portable electronic devices as cell
phones, laptop computers, hand-held games and pagers.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Duncan, R-Tenn., chairman of the aviation
subcommittee, said there are ''lingering suspicions'' that airlines
ban cell phones so passengers have to use their high-priced
back-of-seat phones. He said cell phone bans are the second biggest
cause of ''air rage'' after drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., also complained of the
''unbelievably expensive'' and ''really rotten service'' of
airplane phones. ''We have to provide a viable alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said that while there have been anecdotal incidents in
which portable electronic devices may have interfered with aircraft
operations, they have never been able to repeat such interference
under controlled conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that lack of hard evidence, such interference ''should
be viewed as potentially hazardous and the source of an
unacceptable risk to aircraft,'' said David Watrous, president of
RTCA Inc, an advisory group to the FAA that issued reports on
electronic devices in 1963, 1988 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   McSweeny said among the concerns are that electronic devices
could cause errors in instrument landing or global positioning
systems. He noted that many hospitals prohibit cell phone use
because they may interfere with health monitoring devices.
</P>
<P>
   The aviation industry now differentiates between intentional
emitters, such as cell phones, two connected electronic games or
hand-held computers that receive e-mail, which are designed to put
out radio frequencies, and unintentional emitters such as laptops
or CD players.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases the first category is banned at all times during a
flight while use of the weaker unintentional emitters is allowed
when the plane ascends about 10,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from both the industry and airline pilots
expressed support for the existing standards. Paul McCarthy of the
Air Line Pilots Association said his group is opposed to any move
to lessen current restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Hatfield of the Federal Communications Commission said FCC
rules also prohibit cellular transmitter use on aircraft. He said
that's not from the standpoint of protecting avionics systems but
because calls from above several cellular base stations prevent
cell phones on the ground from using the same frequency.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James McGovern, D-Mass., who requested the hearing, urged
the FAA to promote technology designed to detect emissions from
inside an aircraft cabin that could produce electromagnetic
interference.

<HEADLINE> Miss America Cites Intimidation  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- On the eve of her House testimony in support
of a veterans employment bill, Miss America Heather French says a
high-ranking Clinton administration official was ''trying to
intimidate'' her into changing her position.
</P>
<P>
   While French did not waver in testifying July 12 for a bill the
administration opposed, the Republican chairman of a Veterans'
Affairs subcommittee has demanded an explanation from Labor
Secretary Alexis Herman and the panel's top Democrat has told the
official to resign.
</P>
<P>
   French said in an interview Thursday that she spoke in a
conference call July 11 with Espiridion Borrego, assistant
secretary of labor for veterans' employment and training, and two
other Labor Department officials. The officials had asked to speak
with her, but she said she did not know the topic would be the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Borrego testified the next day in opposition to key sections of
the bill, which would make major changes in veterans training and
employment programs. The Labor Department, not the Department of
Veterans Affairs, has jurisdiction over these veterans' issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''He (Borrego) never said, 'I would like to change your
opinion,''' but did say the bill ''would cause more than 3,000
veterans to lose their jobs and become homeless,'' French said. ''I
took that as if he was definitely trying to shake my testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   The conversation was ''very uncomfortable. I felt they were
trying to intimidate,'' said French, who is engaged to Kentucky Lt.
Gov. Steve Henry, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Borrego did not return a telephone call requesting an interview.
Carl Fillichio, the Labor Department spokesman, said Borrego
''maintains that he never tried to discourage French from
testifying before the subcommittee. Any misinterpretation of his
conversation with French was regrettable.''
</P>
<P>
   Fillichio said the department was in contact with the committee
members and that the department's solicitor and ethics officer
''are conducting a thorough and efficient review of the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after the hearing, Rep. Jack Quinn, R-N.Y., chairman of
the House Veterans' Affairs subcommittee on benefits, wrote Herman
that Borrego tried to convince French to change her mind ''after
she had already submitted her written testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn told Herman that the Labor official ''misrepresented what
the subcommittee's legislation would do, insisted that French
furnish him a copy of her testimony in advance of the hearing and
told French that since she would be appearing with you at a
function ... it would make her support of the ... bill even more
problematical.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Borrego's conduct was ''outrageous'' and that it
''undermines the integrity of the ... hearing process.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lane Evans of Illinois, the subcommittee's ranking
Democrat, wrote Borrego to demand his resignation the day of the
hearing. Evans said the subcommittee staff informed him that
Borrego ''suggested'' to French ''that her appearance before the
subcommittee may not be in her best interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Such conduct ''could only be taken by someone unfit for a
politically appointed office, regardless of party affiliations,''
Evans wrote.
</P>
<P>
   French, the daughter of a Marine veteran who was wounded in
Vietnam, has made homeless veterans her cause and testified several
times before Congress about their plight.
</P>
<P>
   She said she thought the conversation would be about her
appearance with Herman in Cincinnati last week. Instead, she found
herself on the phone with Borrego and two other Labor Department
officials about the legislation. Fillichio would not identify the
two other officials.
</P>
<P>
   French said she has worked with Borrego previously and he knew
of her strong support for the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was trying to maybe soften me from my view of the bill''
that is supported by major veterans organizations, she said. ''It
was to me unspeakable to think I wouldn't be on the veterans'
side.''
</P>
<P>
   Borrego did not threaten to cancel the appearance with Herman
and the event took place, French said, adding she did not mention
the phone call to the secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Borrego also criticized provisions that already had been removed
from the legislation, which is still in the Veterans' Affairs
Committee, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The 21st Century Veterans Employment and Training Act would
provide priority to certain veterans in all federally funded
employment and training programs. It also would require government
contractors to take affirmative action to employ qualified
veterans, set an appropriations level for veterans' employment and
training and provide grants to states for their programs.
</P>
<P>
   Borrego said the administration has ''significant concerns''
about the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The priority system should be changed to one that assures
services to veterans under state government programs, Borrego said.
He also had problems with provisions to measure programs'
performance and with a diversion of funds to demonstration projects
in 10 states.
</P>

average was up 156.63 at 10,852.71.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 11.85 at 1,493.81, and the Nasdaq composite index
was up 110.72 at 4,166.35.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, in much anticipated testimony before a Senate
committee, said the economy is showing signs of slowing.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, the Fed chairman said demand for goods appears to
be slowing down such that it is approaching the supply, a dynamic
that would keep consumer prices lower and stave off inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many of the things he said were music to the ears of the
investment community,'' said Robert Robbins, chief investment
strategist at Robinson-Humphrey in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ''Greenspan seemed less inclined to issue warnings and more
receptive to the idea that inflationary pressures may not have been
as bad as previously imagined during the past year,'' Robbins
added.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyant investors essentially ignored hints by Greenspan that
the Fed remains concerned by the specter of rising inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were up across the board, led by fiber-optics
company SDL Inc., up $62.25 to $421.875. The company is being
acquired by parts maker JDS Uniphase.
</P>
<P>
   JDS Uniphase shares also soared, rising $20 to $126.75, on news
the company is being added to the benchmark S&AMP;P 500 index.
</P>
<P>
   Computer maker IBM reported better-than-expected earnings after
the market closed Wednesday. Investors flocked to the stock,
pushing it up $11.469 to $115.625.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's earnings was apparently the catalyst for the shift in
momentum because Wednesday's selloff, which saw the Nasdaq Stock
Market lose 122 points and the Dow Jones industrial average fall 44
points, was spurred by disappointed investors who sold the shares
of tech companies that didn't live up to high earnings
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 725.69 million
shares, well ahead of Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 4.84 at 532.70.

<HEADLINE> Heel Pain Sound-Wave Therapy OKd  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- People who suffer chronic heel pain, a
particular bane of athletes, may soon get a new therapy: sound
waves.
</P>
<P>
   Sound waves, emitted from a machine called a lithotriptor,
sometimes are used to break up kidney stones, offering a
noninvasive treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Now that procedure is being modified to relieve chronic heel
pain, also known as plantar fascitis. On Thursday, advisers to the
Food and Drug Administration recommended approval of a lower-dose
lithotriptor called the OssaTron.
</P>
<P>
   If the FDA follows the advice, the machine could become the
first approved for a condition often frustrating to treat.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a sharp pain, aching or stiffness on the bottom of
the heel that is worst upon getting out of bed each morning. It can
be caused by bone spurs, but in most cases is plantar fascitis, an
inflammation of the foot's connective tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Physical therapy, inflammation-reducing pain relievers,
cortisone shots and heel-cushioning shoe inserts are typical
treatments. But they do not help everyone; severe patients
sometimes have surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturer HealthTronics Inc. of Marietta, Ga., studied 260
people who had suffered heel pain for six months and failed other
treatments. All had anesthesia applied to the foot. Then half had
the OssaTron's sound waves beamed into their heels and half had a
sham treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Some 47 percent of OssaTron patients were deemed successfully
treated three months later, based on improvement in pain and
function, vs. 30 percent of sham patients, said Dr. Celia Witten,
FDA's director of general restorative devices.
</P>
<P>
   Risks included rare cases of nerve irritation or numbness; two
people suffered fascia tears.
</P>
<P>
   Just how sound waves could relieve heel pain is not proven,
Witten said. One theory is that sound waves somehow injure tissues
that then ease pain by healing themselves.

<HEADLINE> FTC Files Cellulite Suplement Suit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission contends a
Florida company misleads consumers by telling them one of its
dietary supplements can rid them of fatty deposits known as
cellulite.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit filed Wednesday, the FTC said Rexall Sundown Inc.
of Boca Raton, Fla., makes false and unsubstantiated claims to
market its Cellasene supplement. The company denies the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most cellulite remedies, which are applied to the skin,
Rexall's product is a pill containing ginkgo biloba, grape seed
extract and other herbal ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   The recommended eight-week regimen of the supplement costs $180
to $240, the FTC said. The government said sales totaled about $54
million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Cellasene has been advertised in major newspapers, including USA
Today, The New York Times and The Washington Post, as well as on
the Internet and in fashion magazines, television and radio.
</P>
<P>
   By law, dietary supplements cannot promise to treat or prevent
disease directly. The FTC, which oversees truth in advertising, has
the authority to take action against companies that cannot back up
their claims.
</P>
<P>
   Cellulite is a series of irregular pockets of fat that cause the
area around the hips and thighs to appear dimpled.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC said Rexall, which claims Cellasene ''fights cellulite
from the inside,'' had no clinical evidence establishing the pill's
effectiveness. The FTC wants a permanent injunction to prohibit
Rexall from making the claims. It also asks for unspecified
damages.
</P>
<P>
   Rexall said Thursday it will ''vigorously defend the
truthfulness of its claims'' for Cellasene.
</P>
<P>
   ''The commission's action completely ignores the sound
scientific research into the effectiveness of Cellasene,'' Debbie
DeSantis, Rexall's senior vice president of product development,
said in a statement. ''Cellasene was designed and formulated by one
of the world's leading herbal/pharmaceutical extract companies with
foremost expertise in cellulite research. We stand strongly behind
the product and its value to our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   According to its Web site, Rexall manufactures dozens of
nutritional supplements, including Pokemon children's vitamins,
Osteo Bi-Flex arthritis cream and many herbal supplements regularly
available over the counter. The site also shows clips of
commercials featuring ''Jeopardy'' host Alex Trebek promoting the
company's supplements.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Rexall announced that it was being acquired by the Dutch
conglomerate Royal Numico NV for $1.8 billion.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon-U.N. Team Inspect Border  </HEADLINE>
By HUSSEIN DAKROUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   KHIAM, Lebanon (AP) -- Lebanese and U.N. officers flew by
helicopter and drove through rough terrain along the
Lebanese-Israeli frontier Thursday in the final stages of verifying
the Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The team flew by U.N. helicopter from the headquarters of the
United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon in the border town of
Naqoura on the Mediterranean coast to Mount Hermon in the east. The
one-hour flight covered the so-called blue line, the border drawn
by U.N. cartographers last month for the purpose of confirming the
Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese and U.N. officers began the final border inspection
Monday after U.N. Middle East envoy Terje Roed-Larsen informed
Lebanese leaders that Israel had made significant efforts to end
its frontier violations.
</P>
<P>
   Work had been expected to be over by Wednesday, but difficult
terrain and landmines has delayed the process. It was not clear
whether the task would be completed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese acceptance of the completion of the May 24 Israeli
withdrawal, already verified by the United Nations, would pave the
way for deployment of U.N. peacekeepers and then the Lebanese army
into an area controlled by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Officials were upbeat about the progress so far.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going very well,'' Brig. Gen. Jim Sreenan, the Irish
deputy UNIFIL commander, told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything is going on smoothly,'' said Brig. Gen. Amin
Hoteit, head of the Lebanese team.
</P>
<P>
   The team later set out by four-wheel-drive vehicles from the
helicopter landing zone in Khiam, a six kilometers (four miles)
north of the Israeli border, and headed toward the village of
Ghajar on the corner of Lebanon and the Israeli-occupied Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
   A large part of Ghajar was awarded to Lebanon under the blue
line demarcation, which was based on 1923 maps from the French and
British colonial eras. The village's Arab residents have been
protesting the division of their community.
</P>
<P>
   The team stopped outside but did not enter the village, where
hundreds of men, women and children gathered on the fence shouting
across a valley.
</P>
<P>
   Hoteit looked through binoculars toward the village.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters saw no sign of the Israeli soldiers and the military
outposts that had been guarding the area in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Hoteit said three-fifths of the village was awarded to Lebanon
and two-fifths to Syria, in part of the Golan Heights occupied by
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Israeli army officials said a compromise between
Israel and the United Nations was reached under which Israeli
troops would not circulate in the Lebanese part of the village, but
villagers could move freely from one side of the village to the
other.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese and U.N. officers then moved to an area across from
the Israeli town of Metulla, where another Israeli violation
appeared to have been rectified. The Israelis had cut down scores
of wild trees before moving back the fence about 100 meters
(yards).
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the Metulla area, about a dozen Lebanese
refugees stood at the fence, watching the team work. They were
among nearly 7,000 mostly pro-Israeli Lebanese who have fled to
Israel just before the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Nancy Soderberg, the deputy U.S. ambassador at the
United Nations who was visiting Beirut, anticipated ''in the next
few days, a clean bill of health on the blue line that would
trigger an immediate deployment of both UNIFIL and government
forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Beirut has said it will not consider sending its security forces
to the areas vacated by Israel at least until Israel ends border
encroachments.
</P>
<P>
   Another 1,000 soldiers were expected to join the 4,500-member
UNIFIL. The bulk of Ukraine's 540-member contingent was arriving
Thursday in Lebanon. A passenger jet brought 144 soldiers to
Beirut. Another 111 soldiers along with 339 transport trucks,
military vehicles and four mine-clearing vehicles arrived by sea.

<HEADLINE> H. Kong Rail Line Threatens Birds  </HEADLINE>
By MARGARET WONG
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- Ng So-kwan gets up every morning at 1 a.m. and
works until 7 a.m., harvesting spinach on one of Hong Kong's few
remaining farms. She enjoys the last two hours most, when she is
calmed by chattering birds -- a little egret or a Chinese pond heron
sweeping past before perching on a tree.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love hearing the birds sing,'' Ng says. ''The music is so
harmonic and soothing.''
</P>
<P>
   This may be the last season she hears so many birds.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the government-owned Kowloon-Canton Railway Corp.
are planning to lay a new rail line through part of Long Valley,
the largest remaining freshwater wetland in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   The low-lying wetland is home to more than 210 species of birds,
including four that are globally threatened -- the greater spotted
eagle, the imperial eagle, the Japanese yellow bunting and Pallas'
grasshopper warbler.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the only breeding ground in Hong Kong for the rare
painted snipe, a chicken-sized bird with long bill, short legs and
colorful facial markings. Only about 20 or 30 are believed to be
living in the territory.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials hope the new railway will help cut back on
the heavy automobile traffic that is shrouding Hong Kong in fumes
as more people move to the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   While environmentalists welcome the pollution-free railway as
the best cure to Hong Kong's traffic woes, they insist it should be
rerouted away from Long Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The 4.6-mile passenger rail, elevated on a viaduct for 1.2 miles
across Long Valley, will branch out from the existing railway
between Hong Kong and mainland China and connect to a new border
terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Railroad officials maintain it is the only feasible route -- and
with transportation worries outweighing environmental concerns in
Hong Kong, government approval of the plan seems likely.
</P>
<P>
   Bird lovers aren't pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the best place to get to know birds,'' says lawyer and
avid bird watcher Paul Harris, who says he can spot up to 50
species in one afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Long Valley, just south of the border from a mainland Chinese
industrial zone, is the only remaining freshwater stopover in Hong
Kong for many birds during the annual migration, usually between
October and April, Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very important for them to take a break as they won't
have energy to fly so far,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If they land in mainland China, they face an additional peril:
People kill them for food.
</P>
<P>
   Long Valley is recognized as a globally important site for the
preservation of avian diversity by BirdLife International, a
conservation partnership of organizations in more than 100
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Its fields are often crowded with bird watchers during migratory
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials say the railway is urgently needed to cope
with the double-digit annual growth of passenger traffic between
Hong Kong and the mainland, which has accelerated since Hong Kong
reverted from British to Chinese sovereignty in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The number of border crossings has increased 17 percent annually
over the last three years to 77.2 million in 1999, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   And Hong Kong's population is growing fast, with many people
moving into northern areas closer to the border.
</P>
<P>
   Long Valley residents complain of being left in the dark about
the railroad plans that will disrupt their way of life.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government and the railway company have never talked to
us,'' said Ng, the vegetable farmer.
</P>
<P>
   James Blake, senior director for capital projects at the railway
company, defended the Long Valley rail project, saying officials
plan to compensate for the loss of wetland by creating an elongated
manmade wetland after the construction ends.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists and bird lovers say there is no evidence
the birds will be able to thrive on the planned sausage-shaped
wetland.
</P>
<P>
   ''The birds are not like flowers that can be replanted
elsewhere,'' Harris says. ''Once they've left when the construction
starts, they won't come back.''

<HEADLINE> Barak Gets Reprieve With New Talks  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN NOVECK
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- It wasn't just the Camp David summit that was
granted a sudden midnight reprieve. Ehud Barak got one, too.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, the Israeli leader faces a decidedly bleak landscape:
his coalition government in tatters, a parliament battle looming
that could topple him, and the potential for a new cycle of violent
conflict with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens in the coming days at Camp David, no one
thinks Barak's domestic problems will melt away. But his best
chance to surmount them -- and make his reprieve more lasting -- is
to somehow bring home a peace deal that will silence his critics.
</P>
<P>
   Those critics were out in force Thursday. Even as his supporters
expressed relief that the talks were back on, the prime minister
was assailed by right-wing Israelis for making too many
concessions, and by Palestinians for making too few.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition Likud leader Ariel Sharon said Barak had broken
promises to his people and created a ''dangerous precedent'' by
setting up ''an impossible starting point'' for later negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   And Palestinian minister Ziad Abu Zayyad said Barak's ''stubborn
position is a call for another war.'' Referring specifically to the
tinderbox issue of Jerusalem, he called the Israeli stance ''a
tempting invitation to all fanatics and suicide bombers.''
</P>
<P>
   A Barak ally, Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh, countered
that Israel ''has gone out of its way to display flexibility. Now
it's the turn of the Palestinians. That's what we are expecting.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak was already badly weakened when he left Israel 10 days
ago. A day earlier he'd lost his parliamentary majority when three
right-wing parties deserted him. Then he barely survived a
humiliating no-confidence vote while his plane to Washington idled
on the runway.
</P>
<P>
   His troubles didn't stop once he left: more than 100,000
right-wing protesters jammed into a Tel Aviv square on a Sunday
night, declaring they wouldn't accept broad concessions to the
Palestinians. ''Barak is dangerous to Jews,'' one banner read.
</P>
<P>
   And though a later no-confidence vote fizzled because Barak was
out of town, he faces another political land mine in the beginning
of August: a vote on a bill calling for new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the political arena, things looked dire as well. Army
officials have said they're bracing for a possible upswing in
violence in the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
   Hanan Ashrawi, a frequent spokeswoman for the Palestinians,
warned there would be ''a situation of tremendous volatility and
conflict'' if the summit failed. Both sides feared what the other
might do: the Palestinians might declare an independent state
unilaterally; the Israelis might respond by annexing parts of the
Palestinian lands.
</P>
<P>
   When Barak left Israel, some analysts felt his best chance --
maybe his only chance -- was to come back from Camp David with a
solid deal that would finally give Israelis a true taste of peace.
Then, they said, he could go to the public with the plan and
reclaim his mandate.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, it doesn't seem to be turning out that way.
</P>
<P>
   After nine days of hard talks, Barak, who left Israel with such
a sense of historic purpose, felt compelled to write a letter to
Clinton accusing the Palestinians of negotiating in bad faith. The
Palestinians said Barak was the intransigent one.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with talks extended at least for a few days, Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat have another chance to reverse the
tide. But all sides -- Israelis, Palestinians and Americans -- warn
the gaps remain very wide, and the chances of bridging them very
small.
</P>
<P>
   If they don't succeed, Arafat can tell his people he didn't
abandon their dream of east Jerusalem as sovereign capital of their
independent state, or of the right of millions of refugees to
return home. Barak, too, could say he at least stuck to the
principles he promised he wouldn't violate, and didn't bargain away
the dreams of his people.
</P>
<P>
   But judging from the downbeat assessments in the Israeli press
Thursday, Barak would have a tougher time of it.
</P>
<P>
   Having wagered his career on the single mission of peacemaking,
commentators implied, he would look like the emperor with no
clothes. Columnist Nahum Barnea said Barak's precarious political
standing was not even his biggest problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most importantly, he has no clear agenda as a leader that will
allow him to retain the backing of the public,'' he wrote in Yediot
Ahronot.
</P>
<P>
   ''More than the left's criticism of his intransigence, and the
right's of his concessions, he should fear the vacuum, the feeling
that everything is falling apart around him.''

<HEADLINE> Cabot Prizes honor Latin American coverage  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Four journalists, including The Associated Press
bureau chief for Mexico and Central America, will be honored for
excellence in reporting on Latin America, Columbia University said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Francisco Santos, a columnist for the Colombian
newspaper El Tiempo who lives in exile, is to receive a special
citation, Columbia said in announcing the 2000 Maria Moors Cabot
Prizes.
</P>
<P>
   Winners of the awards for outstanding coverage of Latin America
and the Caribbean are: Eloy O. Aguilar, AP bureau chief for Mexico
and Central America; Paul Knox, international affairs reporter for
The Globe and Mail of Toronto; Ricardo Uceda, chief of the
investigative unit at El Comercio, of Lima, Peru; and Lloyd
Williams, senior associate editor of the Gleaner newspapers of
Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   The Cabot awards, in their 62nd year, honor reporters and
editors who have ''demonstrated compassion and commitment to
freedom of the press and inter-American understanding,'' Columbia
said in a statement. They are administered by the university's
Graduate School of Journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Aguilar has been chief of the AP bureau in Mexico City since
1979, coordinating news and photo coverage of Mexico and Central
America. He has overseen coverage of wars in Guatemala, El Salvador
and Nicaragua and helped establish the AP's bureau in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Knox has written and edited for The Globe and Mail since 1978,
and is also a Spanish-language commentator for Radio Canada
International. He has reported from all over Latin America and the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Uceda, of El Comercio, has worked on investigations into alleged
election fraud, the disappearance and murder of a teacher and nine
students, and surgical sterilizations performed on pregnant women
without their knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who began his career in 1960 as a trainee at the Daily
Gleaner, is now senior associate editor of the Gleaner Publications
group. He recently wrote a series about Colombian drug traffickers
moving into Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   Santos was to receive a special citation for his columns in El
Tiempo, in which he has denounced kidnaping and massacres. He
survived a kidnaping a decade ago, and fled Colombia after writing
against guerrilla violence.
</P>
<P>
   The awards are to be presented Sept. 27 in a ceremony on
Columbia's Manhattan campus.

<HEADLINE> Troopers, governor say factions and infighting common in State Police ranks </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Factions vying for support and favor have
always competed within the ranks of the State Police, insiders say.
</P>
<P>
   The difference now is that the infighting, the accusations and
the rancor are becoming widely public. From lawsuits to e-mail
newsgroups, troopers are criticizing everyone from the governor to
the superintendent to fellow officers.
</P>
<P>
   Troopers said the first public charges of racial profiling
started the rumblings. The widely publicized April 1998 shooting on
the New Jersey Turnpike, the state's admission that troopers
targeted minority drivers and the firing of Col. Carl Williams each
ratcheted up the tension, troopers contend.
</P>
<P>
   The latest flashpoint: that picture of Gov. Christie Whitman
searching a black drug suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Even Whitman, who points to disgruntled troopers for the release
of that photograph, admits the infighting is damaging efforts to
reform the State Police. The governor, whose term ends in January
2002, said she fears Superintendent Carson Dunbar will not return
to head the agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''My concern is that once I'm no longer governor he is no longer
there,'' Whitman said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a very strong faction that wants him out of there. A
very strong faction that says we're going to be here after you're
gone so we're not going to change,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   That entrenchment has divided ranks, splitting troopers along
racial lines, some minority officers said. Whites avoid blacks and
Hispanics and some white officers are shunned because they support
Dunbar's reform agenda, said one minority trooper who spoke on
condition that his name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know some troopers who are afraid to ride with other
troopers,'' the veteran patrol officer said. ''It comes down to
'Are you with us or are you against us?' That's the mentality many
troopers have.''
</P>
<P>
   Through a spokesman, Dunbar declined to be interviewed about
trooper morale.
</P>
<P>
   Troopers themselves are speaking.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday, 40 troopers had named the state and the State
Police in lawsuits, many alleging they were subjected to
discrimination and harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Some troopers apparently are venting their ire on an Internet
newsletter dubbed ''Troop Rumblings''. Messages, often anonymous,
use sarcastic nicknames to refer to Dunbar and Whitman. Many of the
e-mail messages directly criticize State Police work schedules,
admissions about racial profiling and minority hiring practices.
</P>
<P>
   Many troopers are angry, but they are not fighting among
themselves, said David Jones, vice president of the State Troopers
Fraternal Association of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The real target is the Whitman administration, Jones said.
Troopers are disgusted because the attorney general's office
admitted that officers engaged in racial profiling, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The message from the top clearly is disappointment and disgust
with what has happened to us. In the name of political correctness,
political agendas, we were thrown under a bus,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Any talk that white troopers alienate minorities comes only from
a handful of black and Hispanic troopers, and they have filed
lawsuits, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're talking about a dozen individuals who have been crying
from day one. They don't speak for the rank-and-file minorities,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not mean the troopers do not have factions -
groups of officers with some common agenda, he said. In decades
past, as each colonel took control, his allies were elevated into
key positions, Jones said. Troopers will align themselves to
officers seen as likely candidates for top jobs, Jones explained.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those are the factions. But it's always been like that. It's
nothing unusual,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks surged higher Thursday as investors,
emboldened by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan's
encouraging remarks on the economy, poured back into the markets
after two days of losses.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 170.77 at 10,866.85.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 14.16 at 1,496.12, and the Nasdaq composite index
was up 119.25 at 4,174.88.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, in much anticipated testimony before a Senate
committee, said the economy is showing signs of slowing.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, the Fed chairman said demand for goods appears to
be slowing down such that it is approaching the supply, a dynamic
that would keep consumer prices lower and stave off inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many of the things he said were music to the ears of the
investment community,'' said Robert Robbins, chief investment
strategist at Robinson-Humphrey in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ''Greenspan seemed less inclined to issue warnings and more
receptive to the idea that inflationary pressures may not have been
as bad as previously imagined during the past year,'' Robbins
added.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyant investors essentially ignored hints by Greenspan that
the Fed remains concerned by the specter of rising inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Banking stocks jumped in the wake of Greenspan's testimony on
the belief that stable interest rates will help lubricate the
lending industry. Shares of J.P. Morgan rose $5.375 to $135.375.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were up across the board, led by fiber-optics
company SDL Inc., up $69.75 to $429.375. The company is being
acquired by parts maker JDS Uniphase.
</P>
<P>
   JDS Uniphase shares also soared, rising $22.25 to $129, on news
the company is being added to the benchmark S&AMP;P 500 index.
</P>
<P>
   Computer maker IBM reported better-than-expected earnings after
the market closed Wednesday. Investors flocked to the stock,
pushing it up $12.532 to $116.688.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's earnings was apparently the catalyst for the shift in
momentum because Wednesday's selloff, which saw the Nasdaq Stock
Market lose 122 points and the Dow Jones industrial average fall 44
points, was spurred by disappointed investors who sold the shares
of tech companies that didn't live up to high earnings
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 848.20 million
shares, well ahead of Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 4.61 at 532.47.

<HEADLINE> Feds To Ivestigate W. Va. Killing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department announced Thursday it
is opening a preliminary investigation into the death of a gay
black man who was murdered in Marion County, W.Va. The FBI began
the inquiry hours after a meeting between the victim's parents and
the department's No. 2 official.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur ''J.R.'' Warren, 26, of Grant Town, W.Va., was beaten to
death July 4 and then run over by a car to make it look like a
hit-and-run accident.
</P>
<P>
   Two 17-year-old white cousins are charged with the slaying in
what civil rights and gay rights leaders and Warren's family regard
as a hate crime motivated by the fact that the victim was gay and
African American.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, in
coordination with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S.
Attorney's Office in Wheeling (W.Va.) has opened a preliminary
investigation into this incident,'' Deputy Attorney General Eric
Holder said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Holder said his conversation with the victim's parents ''was an
informative, disturbing and emotional meeting about a senseless and
brutal killing. ... We will continue to work cooperatively with
local authorities in this matter to determine what if any
additional federal action is warranted.''
</P>
<P>
   In Pittsburgh, FBI spokesman Jeff Killeen said the preliminary
inquiry will ''determine if the victim's federal civil rights were
violated'' and that the inquiry ''is based upon additional
information recently brought to the FBI's attention.'' The
Pittsburgh FBI office covers West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Rights groups and Warren's relatives are concerned that the two
17-year-olds charged with the killing may be tried as juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   If tried as juveniles by local authorities in West Virginia,
David Parker and Jared Wilson ''could walk out of prison in three
years,'' said David Smith of the Human Rights Campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important that the FBI is involved,'' Hilary Shelton of
the Washington branch of the NAACP said after meeting with Holder,
other Justice Department officials and the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a racially motivated hate crime,'' said Wade
Henderson, director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.
</P>
<P>
   The victim's mother, Brenda Warren, expressed frustration with
the Marion County sheriff's department, which is investigating the
killing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cannot see how they can say hate was not involved,'' said
Mrs. Warren. ''This should never have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff's department has not officially released a motive in
the slaying.

<HEADLINE> Syria Ends Assad Mourning Period  </HEADLINE>
By ALBERT AJI
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- Syria's 40-day mourning period for
President Hafez Assad ended Thursday with tributes in his hometown
of Qardaha from Arab officials and some who served under him during
his three decades in power.
</P>
<P>
   Assad's 34-year-old son and successor, Bashar, sat surrounded by
aides, listening in the front row of a meeting hall to about two
dozen speakers during the 5&AMP;frac12;-hour ceremony in Qardaha, 210 miles
northwest of Damascus. The only relative to speak at the gathering
of more than 1,000 people was Hafez Assad's older brother Jamil,
who briefly thanked Syrians for their condolences.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Abdel-Halim Khaddam, in a ceremony closed to many
journalists but carried live on Syrian television, said he knew the
late Assad as a president, a leader and a political thinker.
Khaddam, a vice president since 1984, described him as a man who
''kept in his steadfastness until his departure.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Hafez Assad's insistence that Israel return to
Syria the entire Golan Heights captured during the 1967 Mideast
war, Khaddam said: ''They could not bring him down to cede or
relinquish or compromise on any right related to home territory.''
Bashar Assad, who was sworn in as president Monday, has said he
will follow his father's course in negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Arab unity was the elder Assad's preoccupation to his final
days, Khaddam said. ''He was confident that Arabs' future is in
their unity, that their security, stability and renaissance rests
in their solidarity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Mustafa Tlass spoke of the years in which he
accompanied the elder Assad: ''I fought with him, shared with him
every rebellion, insurgence, coup or revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Hafez Assad gave his position as defense minister to Tlass when
Assad took power in a bloodless 1970 coup.
</P>
<P>
   Among others to address the gathering were Nabih Berri, speaker
of the Lebanese Parliament, and Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan
Nasrallah. Syria holds sway over Lebanese politics and is
influential over the Hezbollah guerrilla group that fought Israel
during its lengthy occupation of southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Hafez Assad died June 10 at age 69 and was buried in Qardaha
next to his eldest son Basil, who died in a car accident in 1994.
Thursday's event was held in a hall put up to accommodate mourners
who attended Basil's funeral six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   No events marking the end of the mourning period were held in
Damascus. Though black flags still were hanging Thursday night from
some street lights and private homes and businesses in the capital,
they will likely come down in the next day or two.

<HEADLINE> BC-CT--Aetna-Healthcare, Conn Bjt,520  </HEADLINE>
By NATASHA GURAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Aetna, free of its financial services and
international businesses, can focus on its core health insurance
operation, analysts said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But improving Aetna's strained relations with patients and
doctors will be a challenge, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna sold the financial services and international operations
to the Dutch company ING Group on Thursday for $5 billion in cash.
ING will also assume $2.7 billion in Aetna debt.
</P>
<P>
   Newly slimmed, Aetna still has healing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problems with Aetna have always been the health care line
and this doesn't solve those issues,'' said Gregory Crawford, vice
president for health care analysis for Fox-Pitt, Kelton, Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now the real work begins,'' he said. ''It's real easy to sell
off pieces of your franchise. Turning around your health care
operation is harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Aetna warned on Tuesday that its second-quarter earnings were
likely be much lower than anticipated, blaming an increase in
medical costs at its health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna said its per-share earnings would be in the range of 85
cents to 95 cents, while analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson
Financial had forecast profits of about $1.20 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna's chairman and chief executive officer, William H.
Donaldson, said the company is looking for a new CEO for the health
care business. Donaldson would remain in the position of chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a number of steps are planned to improve the bottom
line. Aetna will place more nurses in hospitals and other medical
centers to ''make the whole process more efficient and get a better
sense of what medical costs are doing,'' said Aetna spokeswoman
Joyce Oberdorf.
</P>
<P>
   The company also plans premium increases, beginning with
contracts that renew in the fourth quarter, and higher co-payments
for more expensive treatments.
</P>
<P>
   And the insurer plans a ''more respectful'' attitude toward
doctors, nurses and patients, Oberdorf said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What consumers are telling us is, 'We're suspicious of you,
you treat us as numbers and you give us too many hassles,''' she
said. ''We want to address all three of those factors.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the insurance industry, companies are trying to be a
little more consumer-friendly, said Dr. Donald Timmerman, president
of the Connecticut State Medical Society, which represents more
than 7,000 physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thoroughly anticipate that Aetna will honor its commitment
to swing the managed care pendulum back to improving customer
service,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new health company, which will retain the Aetna name, will
have headquarters in Hartford with other major offices in Blue
Bell, Pa., and Middletown, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The company will have 19.5 million health care members, 14.8
million dental care members and 11.5 million group life insurance
members.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even on the reduced earnings expectation, it's profitable,''
said Weston Hicks, managing director at J.P. Morgan. ''I think,
clearly, the key is to execute on health care.''

<HEADLINE> Remains of U.S. Servicemen Found  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Remains believed to be those of 12 American
soldiers missing in action from the Korean War will be repatriated
this weekend, the Pentagon said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The remains will be flown on a U.S. Air Force aircraft from
Pyongyang, North Korea, to Yokota Air Base, Japan, the Pentagon
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S.-North Korean team working in Unsan and Kujang counties,
about 60 miles north of Pyongyang, recovered the remains during an
operation started June 25. The area was the site of November 1950
battles between Communist Chinese forces and the U.S. Army's 1st
Cavalry Division and 2nd and 25th Infantry Divisions, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery operation is the 13th in North Korea since 1996.
Four more are scheduled for this year, with the fifth operation
scheduled to conclude on Veterans Day, Nov. 11.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of negotiated agreements with the North Koreans, led
by the Defense Department's POW/Missing Personnel Office, 54 sets
of remains have been recovered and five have been positively
identified and returned to their families for burial with military
honors. Officials said 10 more are nearing the final stages of the
forensic identification process, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 88,000 U.S. servicemembers missing in action from all
conflicts, more than 8,100 are from the Korean War.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Judge Releases Serb  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In a move to ease
tensions, an ethnic Albanian judge Thursday released a Serb whose
detention led to rioting and mass street protests in the largest
Serb community remaining in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Dalibor Vukovic, 24, was freed without bail until a further
hearing is held within two weeks. He was charged with arson, theft
and assault in the burning of an ethnic Albanian's car last month.
</P>
<P>
   His arrest Monday night outraged the Serb community in Kosovka
Mitrovica, which attacked U.N. police, forcing the United Nations
to suspend police operations for a while. Serb leaders said the
offense was minor compared to unsolved killings and attacks against
Serbs by ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Vukovic, a medical student, is one of several Serb militants who
watch over the main bridge leading from the ethnic
Albanian-dominated south bank of the Ibar River.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally hours after Vukovic was freed, Serb leader Oliver
Ivanovic told about 1,000 people that the Serbian community's
response to the arrest ''proved that we can fight for justice in a
civilized manner.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We will act in the same way to any undemocratic decision by
the international community,'' Ivanovic said.
</P>
<P>
   Vukovic told the crowd: ''As long as you were here, I knew was
not alone.''
</P>
<P>
   During a hearing in the dingy district court building, located
in a heavily guarded U.N. compound, Vukovic told the judge that he
had been drinking that night and could not remember the attack,
according to U.N. spokesman Mike Keats.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters were not allowed in the courtroom, but Keats said
Vukovic expressed regret that the incident had happened.
</P>
<P>
   By releasing Vukovic but still keeping the case active, the
United Nations found a way to defuse the crisis while still
following legal procedures. William Nash, the U.N. administrator
for the city, said he was pleased with the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is essential that the rule of law prevails in north
Mitrovica and that all attempts to interfere with it are
thwarted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome also bolstered the position of Ivanovic. Serb
sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Ivanovic was
under pressure from Serb extremists to push the arrest issue into
open confrontation with the United Nations and the NATO-led Kosovo
Force.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the crisis underscored the deep divisions between ethnic
Albanians and Serbs as well as the tenuous nature of U.N. control
in this Serb-dominated area. U.N. police officers were attacked and
some of their apartments ransacked.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. police commander for the area, Canadian Beloit
Belanger, said U.N. police had lost several weapons during the four
days of turmoil. Computers were stolen from the U.N. police station
in the nearby Serb town of Zvecan, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians consider the ethnic division of the city as a
symbol of the failure of the United Nations and NATO to build a
united Kosovo. The handling of the Vukovic case is likely to be
seen by many ethnic Albanians as another example of the
international mission knuckling under to Serb pressure.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, an ethnic Albanian leader who was a member of the
delegation that tried to negotiate an end to the Kosovo crisis in
Rambouillet, France, last year complained that the United Nations
had allowed a parallel, Serb administration to develop in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Blerim Shala, writing in the Albanian language newspaper Zeri,
said the new Serb governmental structure ''does not accept U.N.
jurisdiction on the other side of the river.''

<HEADLINE> Pentagon: U.S. Troops Supported  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite a recent upswing in anti-American
protests, the governments and majority of people in South Korea and
Japan still support keeping U.S. troops on their soil, the Pentagon
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have always been pockets of resistance,'' Pentagon
spokesman Kenneth Bacon said. ''And I think that that's what we're
seeing in these two countries, that the pockets, the resisters, are
episodically more energetic sometimes than they are at other
times.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a question about why U.S. commanders had increased
security this week among troops in South Korea, Bacon said it
followed last month's stabbing death of an Army doctor in Seoul's
Itaewon shopping district, recent demonstrations against Americans
and an attack against the wives of two American servicemen, also in
a shopping area.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, tens of thousands of protesters formed a chain around
a major U.S. air base Thursday at Okinawa, in a show of opposition
to the American military presence ahead of President Clinton's
visit for this weekend's Group of Eight summit. It followed a
demonstration by thousands last week in which Okinawans protested
U.S. presence and criticized recent alleged crimes by American
servicemen on Japan's southern island.
</P>
<P>
   Asked at the Pentagon's regular briefing it the events
represented growing anti-American sentiment in the Pacific, Bacon
said: ''I don't think I see anything particularly new in the
Pacific.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that we have a situation where the governments of
South Korea and the government of Japan and the vast majority of
the people support our security presence there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said there has been ''perhaps a little spike'' in activity by
opponents because of the G-8 summit and recent political
developments in South Korea. He was referring to last month's
North-South summit that somewhat warmed relations between the two
Koreas and led to the question of how much longer 37,000 U.S.
troops might be needed there to help keep peace on the long divided
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, the U.S. military imposed strict limits on drinking
and a late-night curfew on service members, hoping to defuse
tensions before Clinton's arrival. About 47,000 U.S. military
service people are stationed in Japan, nearly two-thirds of them in
Okinawa, 1,000 miles southwest of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   In Korea, U.S. commanders this week extended patrols by military
police in major night spots in Seoul that are frequented by
American soldiers.

<HEADLINE> New York jobless rate down slightly in June  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - New York state's June unemployment rate of
4.5 percent slipped slightly from the rate of 4.6 percent the
previous month, state labor officials reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The figure was higher than the June national unemployment rate
of 4 percent but improved over the state's June 1999 jobless rate
of 5.3 percent, the state Labor Department reported.
</P>
<P>
   There were 7,156,300 private-sector jobs in New York during
June, the highest in state history, officials said. The state
gained 159,900 private-sector jobs between June 1999 and June 2000.
The 2.3 percent job growth gain was slightly ahead of the national
rate of 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among individual counties, Albany and Warren (2.5 percent each)
and Putnam (2.6 percent) had the lowest jobless rates last month
while St. Lawrence (7.1 percent) and the Bronx (6.7 percent) had
the highest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The state's jobless figures are based on monthly surveys of
18,000 business establishments. The jobs are both full- and
part-time. The jobs data does not include agricultural workers, the
self-employed and domestic workers in private households.
</P>
<P>
   The statewide jobless figures are seasonally adjusted, which
means they are altered to take into account normal fluctuations in
employment - schools being out of session, for instance, or summer
tourism-related jobs - over the course of a year.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a breakdown of seasonally unadjusted figures for major
metropolitan areas in the state:
</P>
<P>
   -New York City, 186,800 jobless or 5.4 percent in June, compared
with 5.7 percent in May and 6.5 percent in June of last year.
</P>
<P>
   -Albany area, 13,800 or 3.0 percent, compared with 3.1 percent
and 3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   -Binghamton area, 3,700 or 2.9 percent, compared with 2.9 and
4.0.
</P>
<P>
   -Buffalo area, 28,700 or 5.0 percent, compared with 4.4 and 5.4.
</P>
<P>
   -Elmira area, 2,300 or 5.0 percent, compared with 4.7 and 4.8.

<HEADLINE> Report: Penguins Shot in S. Africa  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- Penguins evacuated from islands
off South Africa to save them from an oil spill were shot at by
fishermen who feared the birds would chase away their catch, a
newspaper said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Some 20,000 penguins were trucked about 470 miles from Cape Town
to Port Elizabeth and released to swim home. The operation gave
workers time to clean up oil spilled from a wrecked tanker before
the birds could become contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   The Eastern Province Herald, a Port Elizabeth daily, citing two
unidentified sources, said fishermen on at least two boats fired
shotguns at a large group of penguins for about 45 minutes to keep
them away from their catch.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were talking on the radio and suddenly someone realized --
hey, these are the birds they released after the pollution
disaster, and they stopped,'' the paper quoted one source as
saying.
</P>
<P>
   Police could not confirm the report and marine authorities were
checking to see if any dead birds had washed ashore.
</P>
<P>
   The news came as a party was held in Cape Town to celebrate the
return of Peter the penguin, who left Port Elizabeth on June 30 and
took 19 days to swim back. Scientists monitored the journey via a
satellite tracking device glued to his back and posted his
movements onto an Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental Affairs Minister Valli Moosa said the bird's
journey showed its remarkable endurance, and the minister praised
the efforts of thousands of volunteers who are helping look after
23,000 other birds covered in oil from the spill.
</P>
<P>
   Peter arrived on his Robben Island, about four miles off Cape
Town, on Tuesday, but scientists have failed to find him.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities estimate cleaning up the spill from the tanker, the
Treasure, will cost up to $13 million, and are holding the ship's
owners and insurers responsible for paying the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think the excitement about the return of the penguins
should diminish our anger about the incident itself,'' said Moosa.
''It must be possible to prevent this.''
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 400 of the captured, oil-soaked birds have died.
However, it will take several years for the penguin population to
recover because the spill happened in the middle of the penguin's
breeding season and many of their chicks and eggs were lost.
</P>
<P>
   African penguins, which are only found off the coast of southern
Africa, are classified as vulnerable to extinction. The population
has plummeted over recent years and is now estimated between
150,000 and 180,000.

<HEADLINE> G-8 Leaders Gather in Okinawa  </HEADLINE>
By ERIC TALMADGE
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKINAWA CITY, Japan (AP) -- Thousands of protesters formed a
human chain around the gates of a U.S. air base Thursday as leaders
of the world's industrial powers and Russia assembled on this World
War II battleground island to discuss narrowing the gap between
rich and poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   En route to the summit, Russian President Vladimir Putin picked
up North Korea and China as allies in his campaign to derail
American plans to build an anti-missile nuclear shield.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton set aside his Mideast peacemaking efforts at
Camp David, Md., to take part in his farewell summit of the Group
of Eight.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Okinawa summit will create a framework to fight infectious
disease, increase access to basic education and expand opportunity
through information technology,'' Clinton said on the way to the
meeting. ''Despite a stronger global economy, too many people
around the world live every day without essential health care,
basic literacy or the opportunity to share in the benefits of
modern technology.''
</P>
<P>
   His first event was a speech to the people of Okinawa at the
island's Peace Park, where a monument's black walls bear the names
of 237,318 soldiers -- Japanese, American and British -- and
civilians who perished in the island's ferocious 82-day World War
II battle.
</P>
<P>
   So fierce was the fighting that it convinced President Harry S.
Truman that he had no alternative to using the atom bomb against
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy American military presence on Okinawa today -- 30,000
servicemen and women are stationed here -- was the target of one of
the island's largest protests in years.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers claimed more than 25,000 people had mobilized in a
human chain stretching 11 miles around Kadena Air Base. Some 22,000
police, most flown in from other parts of Japan, were deployed, but
no violence was reported.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters -- many of them accompanied by their children -- wore
headbands with anti-base slogans, and organizers yelled into
loudspeakers, ''Clinton, take your troops home,'' and ''We don't
want your troops.''
</P>
<P>
   ''As teachers, we have vowed never to send our students to war
again,'' said Isao Kaneshiro, head of a local teachers' union. ''I
want President Clinton to know that we don't want his troops
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Okinawa -- located near the Korean Peninsula, Taiwan, China and
southeast Asia -- is considered by U.S. officials to be of crucial
strategic importance. But many Okinawans feel the U.S. presence is
too heavy, and want it reduced or eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Military-related crime is a frequent source of tension. The
recent arrest of a 19-year-old Marine for allegedly breaking into a
home and climbing into bed with a sleeping schoolgirl reignited
anger.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most Okinawans welcome the summit,'' said an editorial in the
Ryukyu Shimpo newspaper. ''But there are concerns as well. We are
concerned that the bases, which cause such damage to us, will be
praised by the summit leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   The G8 -- the United States, Japan, Britain, Italy, Canada,
Germany, France and now Russia -- has held summits each year for the
past 25 years. This is the fourth summit Japan has hosted, and the
first it has held outside of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton was en route, Putin wrapped up the first visit by
a Russian leader to North Korea. He was joined by the North's
ruler, Kim Jong Il, in urging Washington to scrap the proposed
missile shield. The two said North Korea's missile program, one
reason the United States wants to build the shield, is meant for
peaceful purposes, not attacks on other nations.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Putin and Chinese leader Jiang Zemin signed a
statement denouncing the U.S. missile shield plan. France and
Germany share Russia's concerns that it could be destabilizing.
</P>
<P>
   Russia said it will push at the summit for a write-off of
Soviet-era debts, despite a bill passed Wednesday by the U.S. House
of Representatives barring debt forgiveness until Russia shuts its
intelligence listening post in Lourdes, Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings are being held at a subtropical, seaside resort in
the city of Nago. Officials are hoping it will put Okinawa on the
international tourism map. The Foreign Ministry says the summit is
expected to cost $750 million, including security, construction and
road repairs.

<HEADLINE> Governor vetoes bill allowing schools special services aid  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Gov. George Pataki on Thursday vetoed a bill
that would have allowed school districts outside New York's five
largest cities to receive special services aid if they chose not to
join local BOCES.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said the state would have to spend $7.5 million each year
to provide the funding for special services aid to such school
districts. That amount was not included in the $13.6 billion set
aside for public school aid in the 2000-01 state budget or in other
multi-year financial plans, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said ''any decision to modify a particular aid
formula should be made in the context of the budgetary process.''
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, all school districts other than those in the
''Big 5'' - New York City, Yonkers, Buffalo, Syracuse and Rochester
- are eligible to become members of their local boards of
cooperative educational services. BOCES members share support
services ranging from technical and occupational training classes
to making sure eligible children are receiving social service
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Big 5 school districts don't qualify for BOCES membership but
instead receive special services aid for programs similar to what a
BOCES would normally provide.
</P>
<P>
   The failed legislation would have made seven non-Big 5 school
districts that are currently not members of BOCES eligible for
special services aid. The districts are: Albany, Troy, Hoosick
Falls, Lackawanna, Newburgh, Amsterdam and Mamaroneck.
</P>
<P>
   Lonnie Palmer, superintendent of the Albany city school
district, said Pataki's veto was a disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ''We bear the entire burden of the entire cost of the program.
We get no aid,'' Palmer said. ''I thought this might help us with
good financial underpinning.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the district had considered joining the local BOCES but
decided against it for financial reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd be spending more and we'd potentially lose control of
some of the great programs and teachers that we've got in place,''
Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Albany district currently buys some things such as computer
services from local BOCES, but Palmer said it doesn't receive any
state aid because it's not a member. If the district joins a BOCES,
it would become a member of a council of about 20 districts and
would no longer exercise independent control, he added.
</P>
<P>
   State Assemblyman John McEneny, a co-sponsor of the bill, said
the legislation would have ''restored some equity to the system.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it made very good sense,'' the Albany Democrat said
of the bill. ''(Pataki) should be bold enough to level the playing
field for vocational education.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill has passed in the state Assembly in past years, but
this was the first year that the state Senate also gave its
approval. Assemblyman Ronald Canestrari, an Albany County Democrat,
said he had been ''very optimistic'' that Pataki would sign the
bill and was ''very disappointed'' when that didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Canestrari said the state could have found a way to allocate the
money required for the special services aid out of its $77.5
billion budget.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure there's flexibility in the budget to correct this
inequity,'' Canestrari said. ''Many bills have appropriations that
are not in the budget. I don't find (Pataki's argument)
persuasive.''
</P>
<P>
   In other bills acted on by Pataki:
</P>
<P>
   -A package of legislation allows Nassau County to impose a tax
of up to 3 percent on all hotel and motel rooms until Dec. 31,
2005. The measure approved by Pataki also sets an entertainment
ticket surcharge of $1.50 in the county and allows the county
police department to charge fees for accident reports. The county
is trying to work its way out of serious budget problems.
</P>
<P>
   -The number of family court judges in Monroe County will be
increased from five to six.
</P>
<P>
   -A bill that would have eliminated the additional 5.35 percent
employee contribution for New York City sanitation workers who
participated in a 20-year retirement program was vetoed.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, sanitation workers who participate in the
program are required to make the contributions through 30 years of
service. Pataki said reducing that period to 20 years would cost
the city an additional $1.2 million, which would violate the
original agreement between the city and unions that the program did
not impose additional costs on the city.

<HEADLINE> Russia To Push for Debt Write-Off  </HEADLINE>
By ANNA DOLGOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia will push for a write-off of Soviet-era
debts during the weekend summit of industrial nations, despite
legislation in the United States to bar debt relief until Russia
closes its intelligence listening post in Cuba, Russia's prime
minister said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Representatives voted 275-146 Wednesday to prohibit
the United States from participating in multinational rescheduling
agreements until Russia shuts down an electronic eavesdropping
facility in Lourdes, Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes no sense to tie these two things -- the station in
Cuba and the debts,'' Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov was
quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency. ''Our station in
Cuba has been in place for many years, and it is no secret to the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers said Russia leases the Lourdes facility from Cuba for
up to $300 million a year and has spent more than $3 billion in
recent years to operate and modernize the satellite station used to
intercept U.S. telephone calls and computer communications.
</P>
<P>
   But Kasyanov echoed the argument of American opponents of the
bill, saying that Russia, like the United States, needs listening
posts to monitor arms- control agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Ministry criticized the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certain forces in the U.S. Congress, captivated by
anti-Russian and anti-Cuban attitudes, are trying anew under
far-fetched suppositions to interfere in the relations of Russia
with third countries and international institutions. Such an
approach is completely unacceptable to us,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Kasyanov praised the Clinton administration for opposing the
Republican-sponsored bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has yet to take up similar legislation, but Senate
Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C., has moved
to block the refinancing package to protest the Russian military
crackdown in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian economy has begun to pick up in recent months, after
a decade-long decline. But Kasyanov warned that if Russia is forced
to pay, it would not be able to carry out economic reforms demanded
by Western nations.
</P>
<P>
   Nostalgic for Russia's status as a world power, Russian leaders
are eager for the country to be treated as an equal by the Group of
Eight industrial democracies at their meeting on Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   But government officials concede that with Russia's economy in
shambles, it is still a junior participant at the Japan summit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody is hoping, and it would make no sense to say, that we
intend to be a full-fledged member,'' Kasyanov said. ''But we
certainly want to push this process forward.''

<HEADLINE> British MPs Seek End To Late Nights  </HEADLINE>
By MARA D. BELLA
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- As the clock approaches midnight, English streets
empty, pubs toss out the last drinkers and the Tube begins its
final run.
</P>
<P>
   But much to the annoyance of its members, one London institution
refuses to call it a night: the Houses of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Forced by party whips or conviction to remain on hand for votes
that may never come, many lawmakers eventually arrive home fuming.
Now, almost a third of the 659 members of the House of Commons have
linked up to demand an end to anti-social hours.
</P>
<P>
   They have called for sweeping changes to brush away the
inefficiences that have built up over seven centuries and make the
House of Commons function more like a modern business -- and the
Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly, which rarely go beyond 5
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''When national emergencies arise, we are all happy to be
there,'' said Labor Party lawmaker Julia Drown, who concedes many
of her colleagues show up for votes only half-awake. ''But it is
the same points being raised over and over. A few people keep the
debate going, supposedly to try to stop the legislation getting
through. The place needs to grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear if she would be happier as a member of the U.S.
House of Representatives, where Newt Gingrich promised a more
family-friendly schedule when he became speaker in 1994. Gingrich
was less than successful in achieving that goal, and both the House
and the Senate frequently work well into the night, particularly
during the summer and in September when they are pressed to finish
spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   Though members of the British House of Lords also keep long
hours, they aren't complaining -- perhaps because they feel they're
fighting for the chamber's very survival, as they undergo major
reforms initiated by Prime Minister Tony Blair's government.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Commons generally goes past 10:30 p.m. at least
once a week and records two all-nighters per session.
</P>
<P>
   To pass the late-night time, lawmakers can be found just about
anywhere but the main chamber, where the debate often is conducted
by only a few hardy, and determined, members.
</P>
<P>
   The others lay claim to the Commons' green sofas, sprawled out
in a bid to get a few hours' sleep. Some drink and trade gossip in
the members' lounge overlooking the River Thames, and a few sneak
away to their offices, ready to return if a vote is called.
</P>
<P>
   It is not until the bells ring, signaling a ballot in eight
minutes, that hundreds of lawmakers emerge as if from hiding to
dutifully file into the ''aye'' or ''nay'' chambers to be counted
for the vote.
</P>
<P>
   This month, a Commons committee responded to the calls for
change with a series of proposals which, if enacted, would curtail
most debates at 10 p.m. and ensure votes take place during daytime
hours.
</P>
<P>
   But while there is cross-party agreement that some change is
necessary -- if only to attract talented newcomers -- the opposition
Conservative Party disagreed so strongly with the committee's
recommendations that it put out its own report.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Tories' concerns are that cutting off debate will cost
the out-of-power parties one of their most effective measures of
harassing the government -- filibustering, or delaying government
measures by debating them to death.
</P>
<P>
   ''Divorcing the vote from the debate also further reduces the
likelihood of members being influenced in their voting behavior by
what is actually said in debate,'' said George Young, the Tories'
leader in the Commons.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Party, which enjoys a commanding majority, insists the
changes are needed -- with no small pressure coming from the influx
of new Laborites elected in 1997, who have young families to which
they are eager to return home.
</P>
<P>
   One new member, Tess Kingham, announced this spring that she
will not seek re-election, likening the Commons to a ''19th-century
gentlemen's debating society.''
</P>
<P>
   For Labor member Desmond Browne, some solution will have to be
found that allows all parties to feel legislation is still
receiving proper scrutiny, while doing away with some of the
inefficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   ''My ambition is simple,'' Browne said. ''To go to bed on the
same day that I wake up.''

<HEADLINE> Marchand Nominated for Fifth Emmy  </HEADLINE>
By ERICA WERNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A month after her death, Nancy Marchand was
nominated for another Emmy on Thursday for her career-capping role
as the scheming mob matriarch Livia in ''The Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   Marchand won four consecutive Emmys from 1979 to 1982 for her
role as the proper publisher Margaret Pynchon on ''Lou Grant.'' She
died of lung cancer June 18, a day before her 72nd birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Marchand was also nominated last year for ''The Sopranos'' and
didn't win, though she did take home a Golden Globe award earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   She will join Michael J. Fox as sentimental favorites at the
awards show in September. Fox was nominated for lead comedy actor
for his role in ''Spin City.'' Afflicted with Parkinson's disease,
the 39-year-old star left the ABC series after the season finale in
May.
</P>
<P>
   While sentiment is on Marchand's side, the Emmys actually have
an uneven history when it comes to handing out awards posthumously,
said Thomas O'Neil, an awards show analyst.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the year after he died of stroke complications, Raul
Julia won an Emmy for lead actor in a miniseries or special for his
performance as murdered rain forest activist Chico Mendes in HBO's
''The Burning Season.''
</P>
<P>
   But Phil Hartman of ''NewsRadio'' was nominated in 1998 after he
was shot to death by his wife. He was considered a favorite, but
lost in the supporting comedy actor category to David Hyde Pierce
of ''Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
   James Gandolfini, as Tony Soprano, is the star of ''The
Sopranos,'' but Marchand's scenes were among the most compelling.
The relationship between Tony and his sullen, self-pitying mother
provided much of the critically acclaimed show's emotional
backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   Producers of the HBO series had envisioned Livia for just a
handful of episodes, but her character proved so popular that the
role was expanded. Rather than try to replace her in the series'
third year, producers have said they will more likely deal with
Tony's conflicted feelings at losing a parent he disliked.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's great fun to be part of a series which has captured so
much attention,'' Marchand, who also had a long, distinguished
theatrical career, once said. ''While I realized I was involved in
a quality production, I had no idea 'The Sopranos' would be a major
hit.''
</P>
<P>
   She called the role a refreshing change of pace from the
''tasteful ladies'' like Mrs. Pynchon that she so often played.

<HEADLINE> GOP boss: Hillary Clinton an angry woman driven by blind political ambition </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Accusing Senate candidate Hillary Rodham
Clinton of being ''an angry woman'' driven by ''blind political
ambition,'' the head of New York's Republican Party says voters
should reject her in part because ''she didn't send Chelsea to
school here.''
</P>
<P>
   In a copy of a fund-raising letter obtained Thursday by The
Associated Press, state GOP Chairman William Powers also said the
first lady has ''been at the front and center of every Clinton-Gore
scandal and this has been the most seedy, shameless and corrupt
administration in American history.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Morality matters and character counts and by her own words,
deeds and actions Hillary Rodham Clinton has disqualified herself
from earning the public's trust, let alone public office,'' Powers
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   It marks the second harsh letter from Powers to surface in a
week. The first one called the first lady ''cold-blooded and hot
hotheaded'' and denounced her as a ''shrill and scheming person.''
</P>
<P>
   Powers is a major supporter of Clinton's Republican rival for
the Senate, Rep. Rick Lazio of Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said, ''These negative
letters signal that Rick Lazio and the GOP have no intention of
running a campaign on the issues. We are confident that New Yorkers
will reject Rick Lazio's campaign of insults and personal
attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Thursday, Powers defended his mailings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm told we have three more in the bank ready to go and we're
just going to keep mailing them,'' the party chairman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's helping raise money - a lot of money ... I've never seen
a response to direct mail like we're getting from her,'' Powers
added.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the harsh words in his letters, Powers said that unlike
his feelings for Vice President Al Gore, ''I respect her.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I just don't like him. I think he's a phony,'' Powers said of
the vice president. ''I don't respect this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to rate the first lady on a scale of one to 10, if Gore
was at the worst end of the scale as a 10, Powers said, ''Hillary's
not a 10; maybe a five.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, on the front of Powers' desk lay a bumper sticker
that said, ''Kiss my N.Y. ass Hillary.'' Powers said someone had
mailed it to him.
</P>
<P>
   The party leader defended his use of Chelsea Clinton's name in
the mailing as a way of attacking the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just pointing out that she's not a New Yorker ... It's
just a comparison with Lazio. His children have gone to school in
New York,'' Powers said.
</P>
<P>
   Powers' own three grown sons all went to New York schools from
the time they were children through college and graduate school.
</P>
<P>
   In appealing for money with charges that Clinton is a
carpetbagger and scandal-scarred, Powers also claims in the second
letter that Republicans are up against ''the biased New York press,
the New York City Labor Bosses, Manhattan's limousine liberals and
the out-of-town crowd from Washington, D.C. and Hollywood,
California.''
</P>
<P>
   Powers' letter said he needs the help to ''stop this ambitious,
ruthless, scheming, calculating, manipulating woman from fooling
voters into thinking 'she's one of us.''' He asks potential donors
''to stand up to the outsiders who mock our New York values and
scoff at our commonsense conservatism.''

<HEADLINE> Conservation Bill Kept Alive  </HEADLINE>
By BART JANSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators staved off an effort Thursday to gut
landmark conservation legislation that would set aside $3 billion a
year to buy land, restore coastlines and protect wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've made some progress, but we've got a lot more to make,''
said Energy and Resources Committee Chairman Frank Murkowski,
R-Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is to continue work on the measure Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But a vote against an amendment by Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla.,
demonstrated that its supporters have gained ground against critics
who say it would prompt a federal land grab.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would create a $3 billion-a-year fund for 15 years to
pay for an array of conservation activities, from restoring beaches
to creating urban parks and paying for federal and state land
purchases. The money would come from oil and gas leases, primarily
in the Gulf of Mexico and off Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The White House supports the bill and the House overwhelmingly
approved a similar measure in May. Unlike the House version, the
Senate bill would require Congress to vote on each purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ''This won't be some unfettered slush fund for the
administration,'' said Murkowski, who worked with Sen. Jeff
Bingaman, D-N.M., to add the provision.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would provide $450 million a year for federal land
purchases and another $450 million for states to buy property. The
remaining money would be spent on conservation programs, but only
if Congress spends at least $450 million for federal purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ''By linking all of our rafts together, we can assure funding of
programs that didn't receive funding under the regular
appropriations process,'' Bingaman said.
</P>
<P>
   Nickles' amendment would have required Congress to vote on all
$3 billion in spending each year, defeating the goal of dedicating
money for conservation programs that historically lose out in
budget debates.
</P>
<P>
   The vote against it was 11-8, with Murkowski and Peter
Fitzgerald, R-Ill., joining Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 701.

<HEADLINE> Census Long Form May Be Replaced  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Census Bureau's director sought Thursday
to persuade lawmakers to adopt his plan to replace the 53-question
long form for the 2010 census with a similar questionnaire
administered every year.
</P>
<P>
   The American Community Survey would ask questions similar to
those now on the long form, Kenneth Prewitt told the House
Government Reform's census subcommittee. He hopes to begin the
survey in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said the survey would provide more timely statistics
essential to federal, state and local governments. Until now, they
must rely either on census data as old as 10 years or on
statistical projections.
</P>
<P>
   ''The American Community Survey is the single most important
innovation in federal household statistics in more than a
half-century, and positions the country well for the century we are
just entering,'' Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey would eliminate the need to collect long form data
every 10 years during the actual census, supporters say. It would
ask many of the same questions from this year's long form, such as
a respondent's income and race.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee chairman, Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., questioned
whether the survey would address concerns raised by top Republicans
in the spring that the long form was too intrusive. Though the
Census Bureau can implement the new survey without lawmakers'
approval, it must essentially secure funds and support from
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be a disservice to the American people if we were to
reflexively approve the American Community Survey in the wake of
the long form controversy, without giving it careful consideration
to determine if it addresses today's privacy concerns,'' Miller
said.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt believes these concerns could be better answered because
a smaller, randomly selected number of households would be surveyed
-- 3 million each year, or 250,000 a month, rather than the roughly
20 million households mailed a long form this year. That would
enable professional census-takers to handle the survey, rather than
some of the 440,000 temporary, part-time enumerators who visited
homes the past three months, Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said a test of the new survey in 31 communities produced
a 97 percent response rate. The mail response rate for Census 2000
was 66 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It would cost about $6.1 billion to conduct the survey and the
2010 Census -- the same amount it cost to conduct Census 2000,
Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Other witnesses were optimistic about the proposed survey but
await a final plan.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Welty, president of the board of directors of the
National Center for Small Communities, said the survey could give
rural governments access to more recent demographic information
that big cities can get on their own.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also heard testimony from Rep. Mac Collins, R-Ga.,
over his legislation to eliminate a $100 fine that can be assessed
to people who do not answer questions unrelated to apportionment on
Census 2000 forms. The fine has not been assessed in decades,
Collins said, so there is no need for it.
</P>
<P>
   ''The complexity of the census long form and the threat of
financial penalties is actually counterproductive,'' Collins said.
''They intimidate Americans and lead to lower participation in the
census.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York, the subcommittee's ranking
Democrat, pointed out that the 66 percent response rate this year
was five percentage points higher than the last count in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Summit Drags On  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, with
furrowed brow, takes notes on a white legal pad as President
Clinton looks on, his eyes puffy with fatigue. Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat hunches over a picnic table listening stone-faced as
the president talks.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen- to 20-hour days are the norm at the summit, which
began July 11 -- 65 days before a Sept. 13 target deadline for a
permanent status agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are no naps,'' a State Department official said
Thursday, adding that negotiators at the Camp David presidential
retreat are drinking lots of caffeinated cola. ''Arafat and Barak
are night people.''
</P>
<P>
   It opened on a jocular note: You first! No, after you! Following
Clinton into Aspen cabin for their first three-way chat, Arafat and
Barak wrestled playfully, each trying to usher the other through
the door. Barak eventually succeeded in pushing Arafat through the
doorway first.
</P>
<P>
   The clowning didn't last long. The summit soon turned serious.
Many nights, discussions continued well past midnight. The
president's work day Monday lasted until 5 a.m. the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   A photo shows Arafat and Secretary Madeleine Albright walking
one night, hand-in-hand, an aide illuminating the path with a
flashlight.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's face did not hide his exhaustion. But Barak, a highly
disciplined career military man, rarely shows any public signs of
fatigue, even after grueling late-night work sessions. And
70-year-old Arafat, despite health problems, displays a sometimes
astonishing stamina, swiftly recovering from overnight meetings -- a
lifelong habit -- with only a few hours of sleep. Arafat's aides
joke that he will outlive them all.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton held talks, on issues that have divided the two sides
for 52 years, on a stone patio edged with tiki torches and in
wood-paneled rooms, decorated with comfy floral chintz sofas and
chairs. There were discussions over breakfasts and dinners, in golf
carts and during walks through the woods.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere was informal -- and so was the attire. In a
Jerusalem newspaper, top Israeli fashion designers gave Clinton a
thumbs-up for his jeans, polo shirts, a white Arkansas Razorbacks
sweat shirt. Barak went casual too with a denim shirt and a tan
baseball cap that the designers called a fashion don't. They were
disappointed that Arafat stayed with his army-style fatigues, but
he got kudos for keeping on his trademark checkered kaffiyeh.
</P>
<P>
   The talks were blanketed by a news blackout, but Lockhart did
share a few details: Clinton strolled with his dog, Buddy, and
watched the All-Star baseball game with daughter, Chelsea. The
delegations dined on beef tenderloin and sun-dried tomatoes and
salmon with Thai curry sauce. There was a ''fender-bender'' between
two golf carts driven by two negotiators ''on the same side.'' A
senior American diplomat ''wiped out'' on a bike.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reported Sunday that he was more ''optimistic'' than
when he first arrived. ''But I would be totally misleading if I
said I had an inkling that a deal is at hand,'' he told a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   The talks heated up Monday as the clock ticked toward Clinton's
scheduled departure on Wednesday for an eight-nation economic
summit in Japan. Lockhart insisted Clinton was leaving as
scheduled. At midnight Tuesday, the White House announced he would
delay his departure for 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors flew all day Wednesday. One report had Arafat threatening
to pack his bags, another that Barak was walking out.
</P>
<P>
   No one outside the compound knew, or would say, what was going
on, but White House photos -- taken early Wednesday before the talks
collapsed and restarted -- foreshadowed the tense diplomatic drama
that would play out past midnight under a steady drizzle. One shows
Clinton looking pensive and tired, his head resting on his left
hand as he listens to Arafat. Another shows Clinton, posed the
same, listening to a serious-faced Barak leaning forward to talk to
him.
</P>
<P>
   Talks were nearing collapse. Lockhart would later admit that
Clinton's temper had flared ''a few times.'' The president shuttled
between the Israeli and Palestinian cabins in a desperate mission
to salvage the summit. But shortly before 11 p.m., in a 28-word
statement, the White House tersely pronounced the summit over --
without an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   A motorcade of vans and limousines, their headlights blurred by
thick fog, assembled in front of the president's cabin. It was time
to go to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a dramatic turn in the high-stakes summit: Arafat and
Barak would stay on while Clinton went abroad. Albright would
broker the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sorry to keep you up,'' a weary Clinton told reporters who had
been waiting for hours for the finale of a summit that enters Day
11 on Friday. Clinton's words, which usually flow from his lips
with the ease of a polished politician, were metered. He was
slightly hoarse.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all thought it was over ... and then we discovered that
nobody wanted to quit. Nobody wanted to give up,'' Clinton said.
Then he added: ''You should draw no inference from this. This is
really, really hard.''

<HEADLINE> Archbishop undergoes knee surgery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Archbishop Edward Egan had surgery on his left
knee on Thursday, a successful procedure to mend torn cartilage.
</P>
<P>
   The 1&AMP;frac12;-hour operation on the Roman Catholic prelate was
performed at St. Vincent's Medical Center in Bridgeport, Conn.,
said Joseph Zwilling, his spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Egan, the former bishop of Bridgeport, succeeded the late
Cardinal John O'Connor as spiritual leader of New York's 2.4
million Roman Catholics last month.
</P>
<P>
   The 68-year-old archbishop has had knee trouble since last fall,
said Zwilling, and the surgery on his left knee was recommended by
his orthopedist in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Zwilling described it as an arthroscopic procedure ''to address
a meniscal tear.'' It was performed under spinal anesthesia with
sedation, said St. Vincent's spokesman Bruce Hutchison.
</P>
<P>
   The meniscus is a piece of cartilage in the middle of the knee
that acts as a shock absorber during weight-bearing activities. A
meniscal tear can occur when the knee is forcefully twisted.
</P>
<P>
   Egan twisted his knee last November, after which he has
experienced swelling and discomfort, Hutchison said.

<HEADLINE> Feds To Investigate W. Va. Killing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department announced Thursday it
is opening a preliminary investigation into the death of a gay
black man who was murdered in Marion County, W.Va. The FBI began
the inquiry hours after a meeting between the victim's parents and
the department's No. 2 official.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur ''J.R.'' Warren, 26, of Grant Town, W.Va., was beaten to
death July 4 and then run over by a car to make it look like a
hit-and-run accident.
</P>
<P>
   Two 17-year-old white cousins are charged with the slaying in
what civil rights and gay rights leaders and Warren's family regard
as a hate crime motivated by the fact that the victim was gay and
African American.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, in
coordination with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S.
Attorney's Office in Wheeling (W.Va.) has opened a preliminary
investigation into this incident,'' Deputy Attorney General Eric
Holder said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Holder said his conversation with the victim's parents ''was an
informative, disturbing and emotional meeting about a senseless and
brutal killing. ... We will continue to work cooperatively with
local authorities in this matter to determine what if any
additional federal action is warranted.''
</P>
<P>
   In Pittsburgh, FBI spokesman Jeff Killeen said the preliminary
inquiry will ''determine if the victim's federal civil rights were
violated'' and that the inquiry ''is based upon additional
information recently brought to the FBI's attention.'' The
Pittsburgh FBI office covers West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Rights groups and Warren's relatives are concerned that the two
17-year-olds charged with the killing may be tried as juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   If tried as juveniles by local authorities in West Virginia,
David Parker and Jared Wilson ''could walk out of prison in three
years,'' said David Smith of the Human Rights Campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important that the FBI is involved,'' Hilary Shelton of
the Washington branch of the NAACP said after meeting with Holder,
other Justice Department officials and the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a racially motivated hate crime,'' said Wade
Henderson, director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.
</P>
<P>
   The victim's mother, Brenda Warren, expressed frustration with
the Marion County sheriff's department, which is investigating the
killing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cannot see how they can say hate was not involved,'' said
Mrs. Warren. ''This should never have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff's department has not officially released a motive in
the slaying.

<HEADLINE> Co. To Pay $11.2M Clean-Air Fine  </HEADLINE>
By GREG TOPPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Oregon-based wood products company will pay
a record $11.2 million fine to the government under a Clean Air Act
settlement announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also requires Willamette Industries of Portland,
Ore., to install an estimated $74 million worth of pollution
control equipment at 13 factories in four states, Environmental
Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner said.
</P>
<P>
   Browner, who announced the agreement with Attorney General Janet
Reno, said the drop in pollution provided by the new equipment will
equal that of removing all the automobiles from a city the size of
Portland.
</P>
<P>
   The fine is the largest ever assessed for factory emissions of
air pollution, according to a Justice Department release.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists welcomed the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''We applaud the administration for vigorously enforcing the
Clean Air Act and for holding a polluter accountable,'' said Ed
Hopkins, a spokesman for the Sierra Club. ''We think it's important
for the EPA to send a signal to polluters that they need to comply
with the act -- and this is a big signal.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the Clean Air Act required Willamette to install
pollution control equipment each time it expanded its factories,
which produce plywood and other building products.
</P>
<P>
   ''But we believe that Willamette did not follow the law,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Browner said past expansions at Willamette's factories may have
eluded neighbors and regulators because the company installed
machines that expanded production without necessarily increasing
the size of the factories.
</P>
<P>
   Browner, citing EPA estimates, said the cleanup settlement will
eliminate almost 27,000 tons of air pollution over the next 2&AMP;frac12;
years -- equivalent to taking 287,000 cars off the road.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Doll of the Oregon Environmental Council said people have
complained about the Willamette facilities in Oregon for years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where was the state Department of Environmental Quality? It's
their job to be policing the environment and instead they're
hanging out in the doughnut shop,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the government reached similar settlements with
Louisiana Pacific Corp. in 1993 and with Georgia Pacific Corp. in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are not easy cases,'' she said. ''They take a lot of
time, a lot of energy, but they produce very, very dramatic results
for people across the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Willamette Industries spokeswoman Cathy Dunn said Willamette
plants account for only about 1 percent air pollution in the Oregon
counties in which they are located. She also said the government's
$74 million estimate of cleanup costs is much higher than the
company's $28 million estimate.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was contained in a consent decree filed Thursday
in Portland, Ore. It covers factories in Chester, S.C.; Emerson,
Ark.; Malvern, Ark.; Dodson, La.; Ruston, La.; Zwolle, La.; Lillie,
La.; Simsboro, La.; Albany, Ore.; Bend, Ore.; Eugene, Ore.; Foster,
Ore., and Springfield, Ore.

<HEADLINE> At-Work-Monitoring Bill Introduced  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two conservative House Republicans joined a
liberal Senate Democrat Thursday in introducing legislation to
require employers to notify workers if they're monitoring their
electronic communications at work.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., and Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., sponsored
the House version of legislation that would force employers to tell
employees if they scan or read their e-mail, monitor their computer
keystrokes or Web use or eavesdrop on their telephone
conversations. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., introduced a companion
bill in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would never stand for it if an employer steamed open an
employee's mail, read it and put it back,'' Schumer said. ''It is
the same thing with an employee's e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ''This legislation says to employers that if you are monitoring
employees' electronic communications, make sure you notify them
first,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The American Management Association said in an April survey that
73 percent of major U.S. firms record and monitor their employees'
phone calls, Internet connections and computer files. One of four
companies said they had fired employees for misuse of
telecommunication equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times, for example, fired 22 employees in Virginia
last year for passing around potentially offensive e-mails. A month
earlier, Xerox Corp. fired 40 workers for spending work time -- in
some cases up to eight hours a day -- surfing pornographic and
shopping sites on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Nojeim, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer, said
he knew of only one state -- Connecticut -- that requires employers
to tell their workers when they are being monitored.
</P>
<P>
   ''The vast majority of Americans are not even granted the common
courtesy of notice if their employer eavesdrops,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation proposed Thursday, companies that want to
monitor e-mail, telephone and Web use would be required to inform
employees annually or whenever monitoring policies change.
</P>
<P>
   ''New technology has made it cheap and easy for employers to
secretly monitor everything an employee does on line,'' Schumer
said. ''This legislation provides workers with a first line of
defense against a practice that amounts to nothing more than a
blatant invasion of privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr likened employee monitoring to the Justice Department's
''Carnivore'' system, which can be placed at an Internet service
provider to scan e-mails for messages associated with the target of
a criminal probe.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do we have any privacy?'' asked Barr, who opposes the
Carnivore system because it could be used to read everyone's
e-mail. ''This is part of the same overall issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation gives employees who aren't notified of computer
or telephone monitoring in the workplace the right to sue their
employers and collect damages of up to $20,000 per employee and
$500,000 per incident.

<HEADLINE> FTC Files Cellulite Supplement Suit  </HEADLINE>
By GREG TOPPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission contends a
Florida company misleads consumers by telling them one of its
dietary supplements can rid them of fatty deposits known as
cellulite.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit filed Wednesday, the FTC said Rexall Sundown Inc.
of Boca Raton, Fla., makes false and unsubstantiated claims to
market its Cellasene supplement. The company denies the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most cellulite remedies, which are applied to the skin,
Rexall's product is a pill containing ginkgo biloba, grape seed
extract and other herbal ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   The recommended eight-week regimen of the supplement costs $180
to $240, the FTC said. The government said sales totaled about $54
million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Cellasene has been advertised in major newspapers, including USA
Today, The New York Times and The Washington Post, as well as on
the Internet and in fashion magazines, television and radio.
</P>
<P>
   By law, dietary supplements cannot promise to treat or prevent
disease directly. The industry is shielded from government
oversight by a 1994 act of Congress, which said the Food and Drug
Administration may intercede only if the agency proves a supplement
poses an unreasonable risk or is marketed as a drug. But the FTC,
which oversees truth in advertising, has the authority to take
action against companies that cannot back up their claims.
</P>
<P>
   Cellulite is a series of irregular pockets of fat that cause the
area around the hips and thighs to appear dimpled.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC said Rexall, which claims Cellasene ''fights cellulite
from the inside,'' had no clinical evidence establishing the pill's
effectiveness. The FTC wants a permanent injunction to prohibit
Rexall from making the claims. It also wants a judge to order that
Rexall refund Cellasene's purchase price to consumers, said Darren
Bowie, assistant director of the FTC's Division of Advertising
Practices.
</P>
<P>
   Rexall said Thursday it will ''vigorously defend the
truthfulness of its claims'' for Cellasene.
</P>
<P>
   ''The commission's action completely ignores the sound
scientific research into the effectiveness of Cellasene,'' Debbie
DeSantis, Rexall's senior vice president of product development,
said in a statement. ''Cellasene was designed and formulated by one
of the world's leading herbal/pharmaceutical extract companies with
foremost expertise in cellulite research. We stand strongly behind
the product and its value to our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   According to its Web site, Rexall manufactures dozens of
nutritional supplements, including Pokemon children's vitamins,
Osteo Bi-Flex arthritis cream and many herbal supplements regularly
available over the counter. The site also shows clips of
commercials featuring ''Jeopardy'' host Alex Trebek promoting the
company's supplements.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Rexall announced that it was being acquired by the Dutch
conglomerate Royal Numico NV for $1.8 billion.

<HEADLINE> Richardson to OPEC: Boost Output  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson urged OPEC
Thursday to boost production and help bring down U.S. gas prices
that he said remain ''unacceptably high.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, regular gasoline is selling for an average of $1.55
a gallon, down from $1.68 a gallon a month ago, Richardson said. In
the Midwest, where many motorists had been paying well over $2 a
gallon for gas, the cost of cleaner-burning gasoline has fallen 48
cents in a month and conventional gas is 20 cents less; both types
of gas now are cheaper than the national average.
</P>
<P>
   ''Still, they're unacceptably high,'' Richardson told the Senate
Agriculture Committee, which is examining the effects of soaring
energy costs on farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson commended the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries for two oil output increases in May and June. He also
praised Saudi Arabia, which has called for a production boost with
or without the rest of its OPEC partners.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, recent statements by OPEC leaders have created
confusion about what the cartel will do.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope they continue to keep an open mind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC President Ali Rodriguez last week said that the time was
not right for new output increases. But this week, he reaffirmed
his commitment to a system that triggers production increases when
OPEC crude remains high for too long.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'The in Crowd'  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTY LEMIRE
For The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
   When ''Wild Things'' came out in 1998, you could tell it was
trying to be campy beneath its sleazy surface. That's what made the
movie fun -- it was so bad, it was almost good.
</P>
<P>
   ''The in Crowd'' has many of the same elements -- the sultry
Southern setting, the clash of rich and poor, the knockdown,
drag-out, lipstick brawls. But it tries to be a serious thriller,
so it's just plain bad.
</P>
<P>
   You can tell it's bad without spending a dime at the multiplex.
You see, the studio wouldn't screen it for us mean old film critics
ahead of time. But here's what this reviewer and six other people
saw at a recent matinee:
</P>
<P>
   Adrien (Lori Heuring) has just been released from a psychiatric
hospital, where she was treated for erotomania, which probably was
the affliction of choice because it sounds naughty. She had sexual
fantasies about her school psychologist and then smashed the
windshield on his car with a hockey stick when he rejected her.
</P>
<P>
   A sympathetic doctor at the hospital (Daniel Hugh Kelly)
arranges a job for her at the South Carolina country club where he
belongs. Perfect -- she'll fit right in.
</P>
<P>
   Adrien folds beach towels, serves champagne and finds out fast
about the obnoxious, stuck-up college kids who are home for the
summer, the titular ''in crowd.'' It's ''Girl, Interrupted'' meets
''The Flamingo Kid.''
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty of exposition early on, so we don't get these
complex characters mixed up. Another employee explains that Sheila
(Erinn Bartlett) is the ''blonde bombshell,'' and that Brittany
(Susan Ward) is ''the queen.'' But that's obvious, because Brittany
looks like Yasmine Bleeth from ''Baywatch,'' when she walks, it's
in slow motion, and all the rich old guys at the country club ogle
her.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, Brittany is drawn to Adrien, and invites her to
join her elite group of nondescript friends. Brittany buys Adrien
gifts, holds her hand when they walk, takes her out at night and
gratuitously writhes against her on the dance floor.
</P>
<P>
   But Matt the tennis pro (Matthew Settle), the object of
Brittany's affections, starts flirting with Adrien. Brittany
doesn't like this and turns evil. Screenwriters Mark Gibson and
Philip Halprin make her say menacing things like, ''I brought you
in ... I can just as easily throw you out.''
</P>
<P>
   Right around this time, dark secrets from the past rear their
ugly heads. People overhear conversations at the most opportune
moments. It's standard -- but not terribly interesting -- thriller
fare.
</P>
<P>
   Besides bad writing and bad acting, the lighting is poor and the
colors are faded.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are little continuity lapses. For example, Adrien
walks into a room and her long, blonde hair is down. A few seconds
later, she walks out and her hair is pulled up in a clip. But
really, who's paying attention?
</P>
<P>
   Watching these shallow, flashy people isn't even a guilty
pleasure. The movie feels like the pilot for a nighttime soap opera
-- one that's doomed for cancellation midseason.
</P>
<P>
   ''The in Crowd,'' a Warner Bros. release, was directed by Mary
Lambert (''Pet Sematary''). It's rated PG-13 for violence,
sexuality, language and some drug content. Running time: 108
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Motion Picture Association of America rating definitions:

<HEADLINE> Staten Islanders being cautious after first West Nile spraying  </HEADLINE>
By JUDIE GLAVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The ball pit was empty and the wavy, red slide
abandoned by the toddlers whose giggles can usually be heard in the
play yard at the Friends day care center on Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at the wooded, Clay Pit Ponds state preserve were armed
with cans of bug repellent and Adriana Robotti's three daughters
rode bicycles instead of swimming in their pool after the city
began the first round of insecticide spraying this summer to
eradicate potential West Nile virus-carrying mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   Two dead crows carrying the virus were found in the Rossville
and Westerleigh sections of Staten Island, the only borough where
the disease has showed up to date.
</P>
<P>
   Despite last summer's spraying efforts, more than two dozen
dead, infected crows have also shown up in parts of Westchester and
Rockland counties. Virus-carrying mosquitoes were also found in
Suffolk County. All three suburban areas are scheduled to begin
spraying as soon as next week.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns were heightened after a 71-year-old man visiting from
South Carolina died Wednesday at St. Vincent's Hospital on Staten
Island after being hospitalized with West Nile-like symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   But Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Thursday that initial tests done
by the city Health Department showed the man, whose name has not
been released, did not have the West Nile virus.
</P>
<P>
   ''The determination was made that it was not West Nile,'' said
Giuliani. Health Commissioner Neal Cohen said the cause of death is
still unclear. ''We don't know,'' he said. ''It's premature at this
point. We may never know.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said Wednesday the man had many other health problems
and noted that other viruses including encephalitis and meningitis
have the same symptoms as West Nile: muscle aches, stiff neck and
flu-like symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   But the news did little to ease the minds of Staten Islanders,
who battled with the twin concerns of virus-carrying mosquitoes and
the effects of chemical spraying.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel a little like a mosquito myself - trapped,'' Robotti
said. ''I can't lock the kids in the house the rest of the summer.
It's crazy and more than a little scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband asked the kids - ages 8 to 13 - to stay out of the
pool Thursday, after city officials sprayed the insecticide Anvil
throughout Robotti's Rossville neighborhood during the early
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a coalition of environmental groups and activists
sued the city to stop the spraying, claiming the effects of the
insecticide - a synthetic chemical similar to the natural
ingredient produced by chrysanthemums - was harmful to humans, fish
and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   ''We find that these insecticides they are spraying are far
worse than any kind of ailment in the city,'' Mitchell Cohen, a
member of the No Spray Coalition Against the Misuse of Pesticides,
said outside U.S. District Court in Manhattan where the lawsuit was
filed.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which includes members of Disabled in Action, Save
Organic Standards and the National Coalition Against the Misuse of
Pesticides, says the city is violating federal and state laws and
is seeking civil penalties of $27,500 each time the city sprays
without the proper state or federal permit.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition says the insecticides can cause dizziness,
headaches, nausea, vomiting, skin irritation, loss of coordination,
twitching and seizures in some people. They also said they may be a
cause of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Lori Daidone, the co-owner of the Friends preschool and day care
center in Rossville, was taking all precautions against both bugs
and the spray that might kill them.
</P>
<P>
   Her dozen two-to-five year old charges stayed inside doing art
projects Thursday instead of playing in the yard.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hate keeping them inside on such a beautiful summer day,''
she said, ''but I'm not taking any chances,'' especially since one
of the dead crows was found just two blocks from the school.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 New Yorkers have been tested this year for the
West Nile virus, but none have proved positive, state Health
Department spokesman John Signor said.
</P>
<P>
   However, CDC spokeswoman Barbara Reynolds said Wednesday that
they expect it will show up at some point.
</P>
<P>
   Seven deaths and 60 cases were attributed to the virus last
year. Left untreated, West Nile can result in encephalitis, or a
swelling of the brain. The elderly and those with compromised
immune systems are most at risk.

<HEADLINE> Injured ticket agent: Airport failed to guard against 'air rage'  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The Continental Airlines ticket agent
injured a year ago in a confrontation with a delayed passenger
claims the operator of Newark International Airport should have
anticipated unruly behavior from angry travelers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey
failed to make the airport safe even though it knew of prior
''anti-social behavior'' by passengers, agent Angelo Sottile
charges in a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Sottile also sued the passenger, John C. Davis Jr., of
Fredricksburg, Va., claiming Davis put him in a bear hug and
slammed him headfirst onto the floor; and Haynes Security Inc., of
Newark, charging the company failed in its duties at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Sottile, 51, of Kearny, seeks unspecified monetary compensation
for ''severe and debilitating injuries to his head and neck'' and
''serious psychological injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, 30, faces trial in the fall for aggravated assault. The
charge carries up to 10 years in prison. Sottile was not charged.
</P>
<P>
   The incident prompted Continental to launch a national campaign
last summer against ''air rage.''
</P>
<P>
   Port Authority spokesman Peter Yerkes said Thursday the agency
does not generally comment on pending litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Davis lawyer Anthony J. Pope Jr. said Thursday his client was
acting in self-defense and as a Virginia resident is not under the
jurisdiction of the lawsuit, which was filed Wednesday in state
Superior Court for Hudson County, in Jersey City.
</P>
<P>
   Messages left Thursday seeking comment from Haynes were not
immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   Continental spokeswoman Catherine Stengel said Sottile has not
yet returned to work.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's just concentrating on getting better, and we hope that he
does,'' Stengel said.
</P>
<P>
   Sottile did not immediately respond to a message left at his
home Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Louis J. Lamatina, said Sottile lost 60 percent of
the motion in his neck, which suffered two broken bones.
</P>
<P>
   ''He can't turn his head too fast or too far,'' Lamatina said.
</P>
<P>
   ''My guy has no memory of what happened. He was in a coma for
five days,'' the lawyer said. ''But he doesn't hold a grudge.''
</P>
<P>
   Sottile has returned to his manager's job at the Kearny Post
Office, but is only working four hours a day, Lamatina said.
</P>
<P>
   He is unlikely to return to his part-time job with Continental:
''I don't think he can do that work anymore; it's standing on his
feet too much,'' Lamatina said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer declined to comment on what the Port Authority or
Haynes should have done to prevent violence.
</P>
<P>
   Continental is not being sued because New Jersey only allows
employees to seek relief through workers' compensation, Lamatina
said.
</P>
<P>
   The incident took place July 22, 1999, at Gate 115 on the lower
level of Terminal C, a windowless area the lawsuit said is called
''the dungeon'' by Continental workers.
</P>
<P>
   Many flights around the country, including the Davis family
flight to Orlando, Fla., were delayed because of weather, the
lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and 10 others, including his in-laws and five children,
were en route to a Disney World vacation, Pope said.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the bathrooms in that area were closed for renovations
that day, and tempers flared as the waiting area became crowded and
warm, with passengers yelling at ticket agents, including Sottile,
the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   The Davis flight began boarding about 9 p.m., about 2&AMP;frac14; hours
after its scheduled departure when one of his children ran into the
jetway, the enclosed walkway connecting the terminal with the
plane, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts differ as to what happened next.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague of Sottile stopped Davis' wife from following her
daughter, saying she could not enter the jetway without a boarding
pass, and that worker went to get the child, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   Sottile then took his colleague's place and told Davis he could
not enter the jetway yet.
</P>
<P>
   Davis then grabbed Sottile and slammed him headfirst onto the
floor, police and the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and his family said Sottile was belligerent, pushed Davis'
wife as she tried to enter the jetway and then put his hands around
Davis' neck when he came to his wife's aid.
</P>
<P>
   Davis had filed a lawsuit against Continental Airlines, charging
that the Houston-based carrier's poor training caused employees to
be hostile to travelers, but it was dismissed.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Launch Ad Campaign  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a televised attack against Rep. Jim Rogan
in California, House Democrats have quietly launched an advertising
effort eventually expected to cost millions and spread to dozens of
races, a key part of an effort to win a majority this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Erik Smith, a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee, declined comment on the commercial, which began
airing July 6 on cable stations and accuses Rogan of voting against
funding to reduce classroom size. ''We're not going to telegraph
our strategies for Republicans'' to know in advance, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan, who played a prominent role in President Clinton's
impeachment proceedings, accused Democrats of broadcasting a
''lying distortion'' of his record. Locked in a fiercely
competitive race, he said he hoped the GOP campaign committee would
respond on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the particulars of Rogan's effort to fend off a challenge
from State Sen. Adam Schiff, several Democratic officials described
the 30-second advertisement as the first in what is planned as wave
after wave of commercials in targeted districts.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising is expected to begin airing soon in another
California district, possibly as early as next week, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   These Democrats spoke only on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said they have the money to mount efforts in as many
as 50 districts, involving get-out-the-vote activities, radio and
television advertising and other campaign activities. This year,
unlike in past campaigns, Democrat say they will air commercials
tailored to individual situations.
</P>
<P>
   One official said other commercials will touch on debt
repayment, prescription drugs for Medicare, gun control, a
patients' bill of rights and other key Democratic campaign themes.
</P>
<P>
   A switch of six or seven seats in this fall's elections would
give Democrats a majority in the Congress that convenes in January
2001. Republicans, too, will spend millions on commercials as part
of their effort to hold control.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Democrats are wasting their money right now,'' argued Jim
Wilkinson, a spokesman for the GOP campaign committee. ''Our ad
programs will come later in the year when voters are actually
paying attention.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Democrats, with a hefty cash advantage -- $37 million in
the bank compared with $22 million for the GOP -- were able to
strike first.
</P>
<P>
   In Rogan, they picked a GOP incumbent who has won two terms
without gaining as much as 51 percent of the vote and who has a
well-funded opponent familiar to local voters. Rogan's high-profile
role in impeachment added to his attractiveness as a target.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial, expected to stay on the air for several more
weeks, accuses Rogan of voting against funding ''that would reduce
overcrowding in California's classroom. Call Jim Rogan. Tell him to
start voting for new, qualified teachers and smaller class size,''
it says.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Rogan said he had voted to fund 120,000 new
teacher positions, but against a Democratic proposal to dictate how
federal funds were to be spent. ''It's a typical DCCC
cookie-cutter, lying distortion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial was developed and aired under the Byzantine rules
that govern political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   It is an example of ''issue advocacy,'' meaning it contains no
explicit call for Rogan's defeat or for Schiff's election. In fact,
Schiff's name is not mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Because there is no direct advocacy, the commercial is paid for
with a blend of hard money -- relatively difficult to raise because
individual donations are limited in size -- and soft money, which
can be raised in larger amounts.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial bears a tagline that says it was paid for by the
California Democratic Party. But the state chairman, Art Torres, as
well as officials in Washington, say the money was being
transferred by the national party committee. Torres put the cost of
the advertising at $126,000 in two separate purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The ad is based on research conducted by DCCC staff and was
produced by the firm of Morris, Carrick and Guma, one of two
companies tapped to handle millions of dollars in DCCC commercials
this campaign season.
</P>
<P>
   Because federal law appears to limit direct coordination between
the DCCC and Schiff's campaign, officials say they did not notify
their candidate in advance. Still, it dovetails nicely with a
commercial the Schiff campaign is running that says he ''fought to
reduce class sizes''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, it is a textbook example of how outside advertisements can
effectively stretch a candidate's budget -- or, in Rogan's case,
force a candidate to re-evaluate his own strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Roe, a spokesman for Rogan, said his campaign is currently
off the air after running several weeks worth of commercials. Rogan
declined to say whether he would respond with new ads of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he hopes the GOP campaign committee will respond,
he said, ''Yes ... I assume they'll respond to protect me and
expose Schiff's record.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Davis, who chairs the GOP campaign effort, pledged to
do as much. ''We're going to make sure that they're responded to
appropriately and the record is set straight,'' said the Virginia
lawmaker....

<HEADLINE> Mitchell: NIreland Peace Inevitable  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Progress toward peace in Northern Ireland is
irreversible, the broker of the province's 1998 peace accord said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell chaired the negotiations that
led to the Good Friday accord, which laid the groundwork for a new
power-sharing government in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   When he agreed to oversee peace talks between the province's
fractious Protestant and Catholic political parties in 1995, he
thought there was ''little or no prospect'' of a solution, he told
the American Bar Association's annual meeting in London.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, Mitchell said he believes long-term peace is
inevitable -- despite setbacks such as the discovery of a bomb on a
London railway line Wednesday. The device, believed to have been
planted by a Catholic paramilitary group opposed to the peace
process, was detonated harmlessly by police but caused commuter
chaos across the city.
</P>
<P>
   ''As with all such conflicts, as hard as it is to get agreement,
implementation is even more difficult,'' Mitchell said. ''We are
seeing the difficulties of implementation.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said the province's economy would expand once its
fledgling institutions become firmly established.
</P>
<P>
   ''While it will take a long time to achieve genuine
reconciliation, I believe a durable peace is clearly on its way,
and I think there will be a remarkable explosion of economic
growth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an advanced society. These are very intelligent,
impressive, productive people and I think, once they get that
political stability, they will experience growth with which they
are not familiar in their history,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Argentine Joblessness Rises  </HEADLINE>
By TO MUSE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- After weeks of protests over
Argentina's high jobless rate, the government delivered more bad
news Thursday: the official unemployment rate remains stubbornly
high, topping 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite pledges an economic recovery is imminent, President
Fernando De la Rua's government announced national joblessness has
edged up to 15.4 percent. That compares with 13.8 percent in
October, the last time figures were released.
</P>
<P>
   The news only darkened hopes for economic revival in Argentina,
which is struggling more than regional giant Brazil to pull itself
out of a region-wide recession. Continued high unemployment is only
causing more pessimism in a country struggling since Brazil
devalued its currency last January, prompting a regional slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment report, released three times yearly, is the
latest evidence that De la Rua's bold austerity plan of deep
spending cuts and higher taxes may not be enough to immediately
reactivate the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Sappia, a Labor Ministry official, said the increase was
worrisome. ''Seeing these numbers ... it shows the country is not
well,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Double-digit unemployment has haunted Argentina since 1994 --
even during periods of high growth. The government has forecast 3.5
percent growth this year. But independent economists estimate
growth of no more than 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Though the latest figure is smaller than the nadir of 18.4
percent reached in May 1995, it still has analysts worried that a
turnaround will be slow to materialize.
</P>
<P>
   Joblessness has been especially acute in Argentina's
impoverished provinces.
</P>
<P>
   In Resistencia, a northeastern Argentine city, jobless
demonstrators demanding work threw rocks and battled with police,
who responded with tear gas and batons. No serious injuries were
reported in what was the latest in a series of scattered protests
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, some 1,000 jobseekers turned out several weeks ago
when a huge supermarket in Mendoza, western Argentina, offered 100
jobs. Hundreds lined up this week for 30 vacancies at a Buenos
Aires factory that makes alfajores -- a traditional Argentine
pastry.
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo Gonzalez, 43, lost work as a carpenter eight years ago.
With too few jobs available, he now sells bags of peanuts on the
street.
</P>
<P>
   ''The economic system is sweeping us into the streets,'' said
Gonzalez. ''There is too little work, too much unemployment.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists said Argentina's high unemployment could partly be
blamed on a drop-off in construction jobs and on labor laws that
remain overly rigid -- despite recent and hard-won reforms by De la
Rua's government.
</P>
<P>
   Economist Gloria Sorensen of Banco Frances also cited a rise in
the supply of labor as women and young people join the labor market
at a faster pace than jobs can be created.

<HEADLINE> State unveils new multimedia anti-smoking program  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH FORMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - After doing 30 seconds' worth of jumping
jacks, 11-year-old Alfredo Echevarria blew through straws of
varying widths.
</P>
<P>
   They started out wide, and ended up as narrow as a coffee
stirrer.
</P>
<P>
   The Hartford sixth-grader demonstrated how hard it was to
breathe as his lungs got more constricted - just what would happen
if he smoked a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of a handful of activities on display Thursday at the
M.D. Fox School as state education officials unveiled a new
multimedia anti-smoking program. Called Science, Tobacco &AMP; You, the
program incorporates digital photography, computer modeling and
hands-on activities to show students the effects of tobacco on
their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The $1 million program is funded from the $3.6 billion tobacco
settlement Connecticut won in a 1998 class action lawsuit against
the industry, said Maraide Sullivan, a manager with the state's
Office of Policy and Management. The optional program will be
offered to schools at no cost and is expected to be in 1,100
fourth- and fifth-grade classrooms this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Already 200 teachers from across the state have signed up for
training sessions next month, Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   The program was launched in Florida in 1998, and is now used in
4,000 classrooms there, said Sam Spiegel, a Florida State
University professor who helped develop the program.
</P>
<P>
   It's too early to tell if the program will stop kids from
smoking as middle schoolers, Spiegel said. But initial studies show
that students have shifted their attitudes and behaviors toward
tobacco, become more knowledgeable about smoking and improved their
standardized test scores.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nowhere in the program do we say 'Don't smoke,''' he said.
''We're giving them more than a message. We're giving them
knowledge and tools to make a good decision.
</P>
<P>
   And teacher reaction, Spiegel added, ''is off the charts.''
Teachers like the fact that the program is not an additional part
of the school day; rather, he said, it's way for them combine
science, health, math, social studies and language arts in one
lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Although Florida and Connecticut are so far the only states that
offer the program on a statewide level, Spiegel said other states -
including Massachusetts, California and Texas - are looking into
it.
</P>
<P>
   The students seemed to agree that the program would effectively
pass on the message that smoking is dangerous, not cool.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a very good way to show you how to take care of
yourself,'' said Allie Cipolla, 9, a Canton fourth grader. ''If it
teaches you a lesson, it probably means you won't end up smoking.''

<HEADLINE> September bear hunt now appears likely  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - With no new legislative action scheduled,
the state's first bear hunt in almost 30 years appears on track to
begin Sept. 18.
</P>
<P>
   The state New Jersey Fish and Game Council voted unanimously
last month to approve the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Days later, the state Senate with a 31-7 vote approved a bill
that would halt the hunt. An Assembly version of that measure has
yet to be scheduled for a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Assembly Agricultural and Natural Resources
Committee now says the bill will not be heard before the hunt
begins.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we should be overruling Fish and Game when
they're acting prudently,'' Assemblyman John C. Gibson, R-Cape May,
told The Record of Hackensack for its Thursday editions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've gotten dozens of bills referred to me. I pick those that
are in the best interest of the state and have the best chance of
being processed,'' he told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The full Assembly is in recess. A similar proposal to ban a bear
hunt cleared a committee in 1997, but was never scheduled for a
vote on the Assembly floor.
</P>
<P>
   The Fish and Game Council cleared the way for the first hunt
since 1971 in an effort to reduce the state's burgeoning bear
population. Reported incidents of contact between bears and humans
have increased dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of many northern New Jersey communities complain that
the bears invade back yards, kill pets and scare children.
Complaints of damage by black bears have soared from 285 in 1995 to
1,659 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   State officials have tried ''aversion conditioning'' to scare
off bears with pepper spray or rubber buckshot and urged residents
not to feed bears and to bring their garbage indoors at night.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades ago, there were fewer than 100 black bears in New
Jersey. It is estimated that more than 1,100 bears now live in 11
of the state's 21 counties.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say the bear population in residential areas has
grown in part because of residential development in former rural
areas. Hunting seasons in neighboring New York and Pennsylvania may
have also pushed bears to New Jersey.

<HEADLINE> Pataki aide grilled in bribery trial  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A top campaign aide to Gov. George Pataki
endured a daylong grilling Thursday by federal prosecutors, who
labeled him a suspect in a scheme to secure the early release of
violent felons in exchange for contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ''You understand, as you sit here today, you are a target of an
investigation of the United States Attorney's office into federal
bribery - you understand that, right?'' prosecutor Margaret
Giordano asked the aide, Patrick Donohue, at a trial in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes, ma'am,'' replied Donohue, finance director for ''Friends
of Pataki.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Giordano pressured Donohue to concede that ''if
you admitted that you were involved in this scheme, you would lose
your job tomorrow.'' The judge struck the question before he could
answer.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue - called as a defense witness in a campaign corruption
case against Korean-American businessman Yung Soo Yoo - has not
been charged with any crime, and the governor's office denies any
wrongdoing. Outside court, Donohue's lawyer called the ongoing
pay-for-parole probe a ''witchhunt.''
</P>
<P>
   But the investigation has dogged the administration at a time
when Pataki is being considered as a running mate for presidential
nominee George W. Bush. Donohue, 29, meanwhile, has continued
raising money for Pataki, the Republican party and U.S. Senate
hopeful Rick Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Called to the stand Thursday, Donohue repeatly denied teaming
with Yoo to broker deals guaranteeing three sets of Korean-American
parents that campaign contributions totaling more than $36,000
would result in parole for their inmate sons.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue admitted meeting with a Queens pastor whose son,
convicted robber and gang member John Kim, was paroled in 1996
after the family arranged for more than $7,000 in donations to the
Pataki campaign. A former parole official testified Wednesday that
the commissioners who voted for Kim's release had been told that
the governor wanted him set free.
</P>
<P>
   But Donohue claimed that when he accepted money, he was unaware
the donors had children in prison. He also said he returned it when
he learned they thought there was quid pro quo.
</P>
<P>
   ''Was (Kim's father) promised anything in exchange for his
contribution?'' asked Yoo's attorney, Nicholas DeFeis.
</P>
<P>
   ''No, sir,'' Donohue responded.
</P>
<P>
   On cross-examination, prosecutors charged that internal memos,
testimony by the parents and secretly recorded conversations show
Donohue illicitly lobbied behind the scenes for the prisoners'
release. They confronted him with tapes in which he could be heard
telling the brother of one convict that he had forwarded paperwork
to the governor's counsel's office - which handles clemency
applications - and that a solution was ''in the works.''
</P>
<P>
   Donohue admitted contacting administration insiders about the
inmates, but only to help the families learn more about their legal
status.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is it your testimony today that you were not trying to help
(the inmates) get released somehow?'' Giordano asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just trying to get a status,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Donohue refused to speak to reporters. But his
attorney, Tom Puccio, accused prosecutors of trying to use his
innocent client ''to tar Mr. Yoo.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This has been a witchhunt from day one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yoo case stems from a grand jury investigation of an alleged
influence peddling by Pataki aides in parole cases. So far three
parole officials have been either charged or convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Yoo, 63, of Glen Ridge, N.J., faces up to 10 years in prison if
convicted on corruption and obstruction of justice charges.

<HEADLINE> House Opens Door for Pay Raises  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Thursday to let members of
Congress receive $3,800 cost-of-living pay raises next year,
underlining how the robust economy and surging federal surpluses
have helped ease what has long been a sensitive political issue.
</P>
<P>
   On a 250-173 vote, lawmakers signaled their assent to a 2.7
percent increase in their current $141,300 annual salaries that
would take effect in January. Majorities of both Democrats and
Republicans supported the raise, reflecting an agreement between
party leaders not to attack each others' incumbents, during this
year's campaigns, for their votes.
</P>
<P>
   During the few minutes of debate the issue received, no one
spoke in favor of the increase. Two lawmakers complained about the
obscure procedural vote that was used to decide the matter, and
only one said he opposed the raise itself.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where I come from, the average salary for a family in my
district is $25,000,'' said Rep. Ernie Fletcher, R-Ky. He said the
congressional increase would cost taxpayers $2.5 million -- ''a lot
of money for folks back in Kentucky.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be lawmakers' third pay raise in the past four years
and their second in a row. During this same four-year period, the
economy has boomed and annual federal deficits have changed into
ever-growing surpluses. Prior to that, the last congressional pay
raise took effect in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Further spotlighting the issue's softer edge, this would be the
first increase lawmakers have approved during an election year
since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress automatically receive cost-of-living raises
unless they vote to block them, a mechanism they established in a
1989 law.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's procedural vote came during debate on a $29.1 billion
bill financing the Treasury Department and some smaller agencies
for fiscal 2001, which begins Oct. 1. By tradition, the Treasury
bill -- which contains no language providing the pay raise -- is used
for any attempt to block it.
</P>
<P>
   The $29.4 billion Senate version of that bill also lacks
language blocking the increase, which seems likely to be enacted
this year. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved that
measure Thursday by 27-0.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the congressional increase means identical 2.7 percent
raises for more than 1,000 top officials of the executive branch,
including the vice president. By a law passed last year, the
president's current $200,000 salary will be doubled to $400,000
when the next chief executive takes office, and will be unaffected
by the congressional increase.
</P>
<P>
   The House's Treasury bill -- $800 million larger than this
year's, but $2.1 billion smaller than President Clinton's request --
is among a growing number of spending measures for next year that
are becoming caught up in an intensifying budget fight between
Congress and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   It faces a White House veto threat because its $8.5 billion for
the Internal Revenue Service, though $261 million over this year,
is $466 million less than Clinton wants. It also has less than
Clinton wants for some counterterrorism programs.
</P>
<P>
   It also would forbid government agencies from giving preferences
to Smith &AMP; Wesson guns when purchasing weapons for federal law
enforcement officers. Federal officials have considered doing so in
the aftermath of the giant gun-maker's agreement to begin using
trigger-locks and other safety steps.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate version of the bill contains a similar reduction in
Clinton's IRS request, and has the same restriction on federal
Smith &AMP; Wesson purchases.
</P>
<P>
   A report accompanying the House bill also would require Hillary
Clinton to provide monthly reports on the travel expenses of her
New York campaign for the U.S. Senate. Republicans have complained
of taxpayer-subsidized military flights to New York, though her
aides say the first lady is reimbursing the government for the
travel at first-class rates.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Denies Pinochet Allegations  </HEADLINE>
By EDUARDO GALLARDO
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- A lawyer for Gen. Augusto Pinochet told
Chile's Supreme Court Thursday that the ex-dictator did not order
the executions and kidnappings allegedly carried out in the opening
days of his regime in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Rivadeneira also told the court that the military junta
then ruling Chile, not Pinochet, was behind the military squad
responsible for the ''caravan of death,'' in which 72 jailed
dissidents were dragged from their cells and executed shortly after
Pinochet seized power in a coup. Nineteen of the victims have never
been found.
</P>
<P>
   Rivadeneira argued for 90 minutes before the court, which is
hearing Pinochet's appeal of a lower tribunal ruling last month
that stripped him of his congressional immunity.
</P>
<P>
   That ruling allowed his trial to go forward, but the current
appeal could prevent that.
</P>
<P>
   Three attorneys representing relatives of the victims insisted
that as leader of the four-man junta that ran Chile, Pinochet held
absolute power after the coup in which Marxist President Salvador
Allende was toppled.
</P>
<P>
   Rivadeneira also revived his claim that the ailing Pinochet
cannot obtain a fair trial, saying his poor health prevents him
from organizing a proper defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''I myself have not been able to have direct contact with Gen.
Pinochet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Eduardo Contreras, representing communist leader Gladys
Marin, one of the plaintiffs, ironically recalled before the court
that Pinochet in recent weeks has received a number of visits.
Those included former aides, retired military men, ''even a
mariachi band.''
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that the commander of the caravan, Gen. Sergio
Arellano, was acting as ''a delegate of Pinochet'' in the cities
where the executions took place.
</P>
<P>
   As the day before when the hearings opened to decide whether the
former dictator should be tried, small groups of Pinochet foes and
backers peacefully demonstrated under the rain outside the court
building.
</P>
<P>
   Police kept them one block apart ''which meant that only very
minor incidents occurred,'' said police Maj. Jaime Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Rivadeneira also argued that the Supreme Court lacks
jurisdiction over Pinochet because he, as a former chief of state,
should first have been impeached by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Gustavo Horvitz, a lawyer for the widow of a journalist killed
by the caravan, said that congress did not even exist under
Pinochet because the former dictator himself closed it after the
coup. Congress reopened in 1990 after Pinochet stepped down from
power.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonso Insunza, representing the family of a union leader
executed by the caravan, told the court that Pinochet was
responsible ''for the crimes of homicide, kidnapping and illegal
... (burying) of bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   Six more anti-Pinochet lawyers will appear in court Friday
before the three days of proceedings end. The court has no deadline
for issuing its ruling, which cannot be appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's lawyer say that before the ruling they believe to
determine the former leader's fitness to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, 84, has diabetes, uses a pacemaker and suffered three
mild strokes during 16 months of house detention in London, where
he was released after doctors said he was physically and mentally
unfit to stand trial. He had been detained on a warrant by a
Spanish judge wanting to try him.
</P>
<P>
   The case before the court is one of 146 criminal complaints
filed against the former dictator for deaths and disappearances
blamed on his 1973-90 regime.

Ehud Barak of giving up the holy city in modern times. Palestinians
demonstrated urging Yasser Arafat to stand firm.
</P>
<P>
   At President Clinton's urging, the leaders remained at the
retreat near Washington for the weekend, although nine days of
intensive talks aimed at producing a permanent peace accord failed.
Talks are expected to resume when Clinton returns from an economic
summit next week.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli media said the sides were using the break to study
American proposals aimed at unraveling the knottiest disagreements,
over Jerusalem, borders and refugees.
</P>
<P>
   All sides were planning major demonstrations over the weekend.
Peace activists planned a prayer vigil by the Western Wall in
Jerusalem's Old City on Friday. A central square in Tel Aviv is to
be the scene of a mass demonstration against Barak Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Even in this overheated political culture, the rhetoric achieved
an unprecedented apocalyptic tone.
</P>
<P>
   Cabinet Minister Haim Ramon, a close associate of Barak, warned
of the grim alternatives to a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''An explosion in the talks can lead to other explosions which
might lead to bloodshed,'' Ramon told Israel's army radio.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish settlers also said they were preparing for Palestinian
violence if the summit failed.
</P>
<P>
   Settler leader Pinhas Wallerstein said his settlement recently
purchased nightvision equipment and telescopes for weapons. He is
also requesting additional bullet proof vests for settlement
security guards.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone understands Arafat wants a war between us and we need
to prepare ourselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The army confirmed that it had been providing extra training to
reserves soldiers who live on the settlements. Army chief of staff
Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz has said he fears an intensification of
violence if the talks fail.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians decried such warnings as provocative -- but
echoed them in their own predictions of what failure would bring.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the summit fails, we will enter a black era in the history
of peace process,'' said Communications Minister Imad Fallouji.
''And if we face any Israeli challenges, we are ready and all our
options are open.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Hamas, a militant Islamic group opposed to the
peace process and to Israel's existence, expressed hope the summit
would fail. Hamas planned its own mass rally in Gaza on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's supporters continued their daily demonstrations urging
him to stand firm on all issues, including the release of 1,600
Palestinians jailed by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Barak supporters maintaining a peace vigil in Tel Aviv led a
symbolic tour of sights where terror bombers had struck, arguing
that a comprehensive peace deal would end such agonies.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkish opposition leaders said that peace was a worthy goal,
but accused Barak of giving too much away too soon, citing reports
that he was ready for some Palestinian sovereignty in Jerusalem and
had offered about 95 percent of disputed territory.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition Likud party leader Ariel Sharon said those reported
concessions ''set a dangerous precedent that will create an
impossible starting point for future negotiations.''

<HEADLINE> Miss America Claims Intimidation  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- On the eve of her House testimony in support
of a veterans employment bill, Miss America Heather French says a
high-ranking Clinton administration official was ''trying to
intimidate'' her into changing her position.
</P>
<P>
   While French did not waver in testifying July 12 for a bill the
administration opposed, the Republican chairman of a Veterans'
Affairs subcommittee has demanded an explanation from Labor
Secretary Alexis Herman. Also, the Veterans' Affairs Committee's
top Democrat has told the official to resign.
</P>
<P>
   French said in an interview Thursday that she spoke in a
conference call July 11 with Espiridion Borrego, assistant
secretary of labor for veterans' employment and training, and two
other Labor Department officials. The officials had asked to speak
with her, but she said she did not know the topic would be the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Borrego testified the next day in opposition to key sections of
the bill, which would make major changes in veterans training and
employment programs. The Labor Department, not the Department of
Veterans Affairs, has jurisdiction over these veterans' issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''He (Borrego) never said, 'I would like to change your
opinion,''' but did say the bill ''would cause more than 3,000
veterans to lose their jobs and become homeless,'' French said. ''I
took that as if he was definitely trying to shake my testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   The conversation was ''very uncomfortable. I felt they were
trying to intimidate,'' said French, who is engaged to Kentucky Lt.
Gov. Steve Henry, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Borrego did not return a telephone call requesting an interview.
Carl Fillichio, the Labor Department spokesman, said Borrego
''maintains that he never tried to discourage French from
testifying before the subcommittee. Any misinterpretation of his
conversation with French was regrettable.''
</P>
<P>
   Fillichio said the department was in contact with the committee
members and that the department's solicitor and ethics officer
''are conducting a thorough and efficient review of the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after the hearing, Rep. Jack Quinn, R-N.Y., chairman of
the House Veterans' Affairs subcommittee on benefits, wrote Herman
that Borrego tried to convince French to change her mind ''after
she had already submitted her written testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn told Herman that the Labor official ''misrepresented what
the subcommittee's legislation would do, insisted that French
furnish him a copy of her testimony in advance of the hearing and
told French that since she would be appearing with you at a
function ... it would make her support of the ... bill even more
problematical.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Borrego's conduct was ''outrageous'' and that it
''undermines the integrity of the ... hearing process.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lane Evans of Illinois, the committee's ranking Democrat,
wrote Borrego to demand his resignation the day of the hearing.
Evans said the subcommittee staff informed him that Borrego
''suggested'' to French ''that her appearance before the
subcommittee may not be in her best interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Such conduct ''could only be taken by someone unfit for a
politically appointed office, regardless of party affiliations,''
Evans wrote.
</P>
<P>
   French, the daughter of a Marine veteran who was wounded in
Vietnam, has made homeless veterans her cause and testified several
times before Congress about their plight.
</P>
<P>
   She said she thought the conversation would be about her
appearance with Herman in Cincinnati last week. Instead, she found
herself on the phone with Borrego and two other Labor Department
officials about the legislation. Fillichio would not identify the
two other officials.
</P>
<P>
   French said she has worked with Borrego previously and he knew
of her strong support for the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was trying to maybe soften me from my view of the bill''
that is supported by major veterans organizations, she said. ''It
was to me unspeakable to think I wouldn't be on the veterans'
side.''
</P>
<P>
   Borrego did not threaten to cancel the appearance with Herman
and the event took place, French said, adding she did not mention
the phone call to the secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Borrego also criticized provisions that already had been removed
from the legislation, which is still in the Veterans' Affairs
Committee, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The 21st Century Veterans Employment and Training Act would
provide priority to certain veterans in all federally funded
employment and training programs. It also would require government
contractors to take affirmative action to employ qualified
veterans, set an appropriations level for veterans' employment and
training and provide grants to states for their programs.
</P>
<P>
   Borrego said the administration has ''significant concerns''
about the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The priority system should be changed to one that assures
services to veterans under state government programs, Borrego said.
He also had problems with provisions to measure programs'
performance and with a diversion of funds to demonstration projects
in 10 states.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton says Lazio wrong to oppose FHA expansion  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton blasted GOP Senate
rival Rick Lazio on Thursday for opposing the expansion of a
federal program to help first-time home buyers secure mortgages.
The first lady said it showed the congressman was again kowtowing
to special interests.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know why he would fight so hard against an effort to
make homes affordable to people in his own district and throughout
New York but I can only assume that once again we're seeing a
pattern with him,'' Clinton said in an interview with The
Associated Press late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He supports the mortgage industry's needs over the needs of
his own constituents,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio spokesman Bryan Flood called Clinton's comments
''laughable.''
</P>
<P>
   ''No one has done more to increase affordable housing in New
York than Rick Lazio,'' Flood said. ''Where has Hillary Clinton
been and what has she done to help homeowners in New York?''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Lazio, chairman of the House subcommittee on housing,
opposed a plan to raise caps on the Federal Housing Authority
insurance program, which would make more middle-class people
eligible. Instead, a watered-down version of the plan passed in the
House that expanded the program but by a much smaller percentage
than Democrats and the Department of Housing and Urban Development
had sought.
</P>
<P>
   The House raised the limit on FHA-insured mortgages to a range
of $109,000 to $197,000, depending on the location. HUD, which
oversees the mortgage finance agency, had sought an
across-the-board increase to $227,150.
</P>
<P>
   As first reported by The New York Times, less than one month
after the expansion was scaled back, a political action committee
set up by Lazio in New York received donations totaling $23,500
from six of the largest mortgage insurance companies. The companies
were opposed to the expansion because they believed it would siphon
away their business.
</P>
<P>
   The Lazio camp has denied any link between the donations and the
legislative action.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton refused to say Thursday whether she believed them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we should leave it to New Yorkers to determine what
kind of connection there was,'' Clinton said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the Federal Housing Authority insurance program is
especially important in New York ''because as everybody knows our
cost of housing is very high.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's particularly true in his (Lazio's) own district,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   Among the biggest beneficiaries of the FHA program are
minorities, inner city residents and others who cannot qualify for
conventional mortgages. Most of them are also first-time buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the FHA program, down payments can be as low as 3 percent
and borrowers can use gifts of money from relatives to make the
payments, which conventional lenders generally do not allow.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's campaign filing released this week shows he has
continued to rake in cash from the housing industry since 1998,
although it is dwarfed by the sum he has taken in from the banks
and financial services houses.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio raised some $29,500 in political action committees
representing housing and construction industries since he entered
the race in May, reports show.
</P>
<P>
   He garnered more than $100,000 from the banking and financial
services industry. Those numbers do not contain nations from
individual contributors from the various firms and organizations,
whose donations would drive the total higher.
</P>
<P>
   Among Lazio's largest PAC contributors were Lehman Brothers
($9,000), Arthur Anderson ($8,000), Bank of New York ($8,000) and
Credit Suisse First Boston ($6,000)
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, who holds seats on the powerful House banking and
commerce committees, was involved in negotiations over last year's
sweeping financial services modernization bill which allowed banks,
securities firms and insurance companies to merge and sell each
other's products.

<HEADLINE> Federated's Fingerhut unit has costly problems  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CINCINNATI (AP) - Federated Department Stores Inc., the
nationwide retailer whose stable of stores includes Macy's and
Bloomingdale's, is trying to stop multimillion-dollar losses that
bad-debt problems have caused at its Fingerhut direct-to-consumer
sales subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   The credit delinquencies will cost $150 million - 43 cents per
share - against second-quarter earnings before interest and taxes,
management said Thursday. Federated said it is moving to fix the
problem, but still expects it could cause pre-tax losses of an
additional $200 million to $250 million this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Tightening access to Fingerhut's credit is one of Federated's
solutions, but that will hurt the catalog sales, management said.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati-based Federated bought Fingerhut Cos. Inc. for $1.7
billion last year to jump-start the retailer's direct-to-customer
sales business. Minneapolis-based Fingerhut brought expertise in
direct marketing and handling orders through catalogs and the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Financial and Credit Services Group, the Federated unit that
handles credit-card operations for the company's stores and those
of some other retailers, is now supervising Fingerhut's credit
operations, management said.
</P>
<P>
   The problems do not affect Federated's core business of
department stores including Macy's, Bloomingdale's, The Bon Marche
and Rich's, said James Zimmerman, Federated's chairman and chief
executive officer. Those stores are performing well, except for
weaker sales lately in apparel, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Federated has annual sales of $17.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company is stepping up its debt collections, reducing the
size of credit lines and tightening initial granting of credit to
reduce exposure to bad debt, management said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are taking this situation very seriously,'' Zimmerman said.
''We believe we understand the problem, we know what caused it and
we are aggressively taking steps to fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   Federated said Fingerhut's credit delinquencies were caused by:
</P>
<P>
   - Implementing late-payment fees, with an inadequate provision
for write-offs.
</P>
<P>
   - Aggressive deferred-credit offerings for new customers.
</P>
<P>
   - Higher interest rates and increased gasoline prices that have
made it harder for low-income customers, who benefited from looser
credit availability in recent years, to meet credit obligations
now.

<HEADLINE> Hatch, Leahy: Sens. Aren't Racist  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate Judiciary Committee's top
Republican branded as ''false and malicious'' recent allegations
that Senate Republicans are racist for holding up approval of
minority and female judge nominees.
</P>
<P>
   ''Has Congress really sunk so low?'' Judiciary Chairman Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The comments came as the committee approved the nomination of
Johnnie Rawlinson of Nevada, who is a black woman, for a 9th
Circuit Court of Appeals seat. Her nomination has been pending
since February.
</P>
<P>
   Rawlinson has been a federal judge in Las Vegas since 1998 and
is the first black woman in Nevada history to hold a position on
the U.S. District Court bench.
</P>
<P>
   The full Senate must still vote on the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Congressional Black Caucus leveled the
accusations against the GOP-controlled Senate on Wednesday. Judges
cannot be approved without first making it through Hatch's
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Judiciary Committee and the Senate consider judicial
nominees without regard to their race or gender,'' said Hatch, who
pointed out that 60 percent of African-American nominees have been
approved since he became chairman of the Judiciary Committee in
1995. ''Any contrary accusation or even suggestion is simply false
and malicious.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., defending Hatch, said he knows that
the committee chairman is neither racist or sexist. But the ranking
Democrat on the Judiciary Committee says the committee should
appoint more judges before the year is up.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a long way to go before we can think about resting on
any laurels,'' Leahy said.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Black Caucus is citing figures showing that,
as of last November, the Senate had confirmed 42 percent of
Clinton's white nominees but less than 18 percent of his black
nominees. Also, during last year's congressional session, senators
took two months longer to consider black nominees than they did
considering whites, and 65 days longer considering women than they
did men, the caucus said.
</P>
<P>
   They also want a black nominee approved for the 4th Circuit,
which covers South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland and
West Virginia. That circuit has never had a black judge, although
it has more black citizens than any other judicial circuit in
America.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., has used his power as that state's
senator to block three North Carolinians from having their
nominations heard. He says the circuit has enough judges. The
caucus is now pushing Roger Gregory of Virginia for the seat, which
has been vacant for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said the committee does not consider race and gender in
its decisions. However, he says that Justice Department figures
show that since January, 59 percent of minority nominees and 65
percent of female nominees have been approved. White males were
approved at a 64 percent rate, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Minority nominees, female nominees and white male nominees are
being confirmed in nearly identical ratios,'' Hatch said.

<HEADLINE> Leaders To Skip Peru Inauguration  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Colombia's president on Thursday became the
12th Latin leader to announce plans to skip the inauguration of
President Alberto Fujimori, who's battling charges that his
re-election was tainted.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian President Andres Pastrana's agenda is ''exceedingly
full,'' said Maria Cristina Zuleta, Colombia's ambassador to Peru.
She said Vice President Gustavo Bell will be sent in his place.
</P>
<P>
   The declined invitation follows charges from opposition forces
that Fujimori and his supporters waged an illegal campaign of dirty
tricks, intimidation and fraud to gain an unprecedented five-year
term.
</P>
<P>
   International election monitors say Peru's presidential election
failed to meet basic international standards for a fair and free
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Most Latin American presidents were loath to condemn Fujimori's
May 28 re-election victory over an opponent who boycotted the vote,
charging Fujimori planned to rig the result. Many of them now
appear to be distancing themselves from the authoritarian leader.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Paraguay,
Uruguay, Costa Rica, Panama, El Salvador, Guatemala and Cuba have
excused themselves from Fujimori's swearing in, many citing
scheduling conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Nine Latin American presidents attended Fujimori's second term
inauguration in 1995. Five were there for his first term ceremony
in 1990. But as of Thursday, only the presidents of Ecuador and
Bolivia had confirmed that they will come to the new inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   Since his re-election, Fujimori has pledged to negotiate with
his political rivals to improve Peru's damaged democracy with the
help of the Organization of American States.
</P>
<P>
   Dominican Republic Foreign Minister Eduardo Latorre, who is
scheduled to take up residence in Peru in August as a special OAS
envoy, met this week with Fujimori and opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone with whom we have spoken, including President Alberto
Fujimori, recognizes the need to take action to fortify democratic
institutions in Peru,'' Latorre said before taking off from Lima's
international airport late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But opposition parties, civic leaders and labor federations
still plan to launch three days of peaceful protests next week in
an attempt to disrupt Fujimori's swearing in.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has said that no state of emergency will be declared to
thwart the demonstrations.

<HEADLINE> Toddler shifts minivan, hits 86-year-old man  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MEDUSA, N.Y. (AP) - An 86-year-old man was critically injured
Thursday when a 2-year-old girl wriggled out of her car seat and
put a minivan into gear, causing it to roll 150 feet before hitting
the man, police said.
</P>
<P>
   George Dudley, an architect who worked on such projects as
Lincoln Center, Rockefeller Center and the Empire State Plaza,
suffered internal injuries, broken bones in his face and cuts,
according to Albany Medical Center Hospital spokesman Greg McGarry.
After surgery, he was in critical condition in the hospital's
intensive care unit.
</P>
<P>
   Police said 27-year-old Pennie Chase parked at the Medusa
General Store to mail some letters and left the engine running in
the 1988 Plymouth Caravan. Her daughter managed to get free of the
car seat and put the van in gear. It rolled 150 feet across the
street and over Dudley, who was sitting in a lawn chair sketching.
</P>
<P>
   Dudley was pinned beneath the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the toddler was not injured.
</P>
<P>
   Chase was ticketed for leaving an unattended motor vehicle.

<HEADLINE> FDA Panel OK's Implanted Hear Aid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans frustrated with their hearing aids
may soon get to try a new surgical implant to help them hear
better.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to the Food and Drug Administration unanimously
recommended Thursday that Symphonix Inc. be allowed to sell its
Vibrant Soundbridge as a treatment for the moderate to severe
hearing loss that afflicts millions.
</P>
<P>
   Regular hearing aids that are slipped inside the ear magnify
sound.
</P>
<P>
   The Symphonix implant, in contrast, takes sound and converts it
to mechanical vibrations of the middle ear bones -- the way normal
sound moves those bones.
</P>
<P>
   A receiver is implanted behind the ear, leading a wire down to a
small electromagnet in the middle ear that drives vibrations when
sound is converted to electrical energy, explained Nancy Brogdon,
FDA's director of ear, nose and throat devices.
</P>
<P>
   (The implant is very different than another surgical treatment,
cochlear implants, for the profoundly deaf. Cochlear implants are
electronic systems that send sound-generated impulses to the brain
to bypass a flaw in the inner ear.)
</P>
<P>
   The Symphonix implant was studied in about 130 Americans. They
first were tested with hearing aids in both ears, and then with the
implant in one ear and a hearing aid in the other. Patients could
hear about as well with the implant as with two hearing aids,
Brogdon said.
</P>
<P>
   The study didn't prove the implant was superior to hearing aids,
she said. But it has the advantage that it cannot be seen and can
avoid certain other problems inherent to hearing aids, such as
complications from ear wax and moisture.
</P>
<P>
   The surgery did pose some risks, Brogdon warned, including
facial nerve damage, altered taste and temporary pain.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA didn't signal when it would decide the implant's fate.
The FDA isn't bound by its advisers' recommendations, but it
typically follows them.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Building Collapse Kills 15  </HEADLINE>
By MARIAM FAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Egypt (AP) -- A six-story building collapsed after a
devastating blaze while firefighters and workers were inside,
killing 15 people including the commander of the city's fire
brigade, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At least 38 factory workers and firefighters were injured in the
collapse or from smoke inhalation, said officials at Muwasa
Hospital in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria. The fire broke
out Wednesday, and the collapse occurred hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Workers said they feared many of their colleagues were still
trapped in the building, which housed a clothing factory. The
workers had returned to the building to salvage material.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency workers on Thursday used bulldozers to clear a pile of
concrete and steel while anxious relatives looked on. The Interior
Ministry said emergency workers would continue to search the rubble
for bodies or for possible survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Emad Mohammed Ali, a 17-year-old worker, said he rushed to the
factory after the fire to check on his younger brother, who also
worked there.
</P>
<P>
   The two later went into the building to help salvage material,
and were inside when it collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was like an earthquake,'' said Ali. He said he lost
consciousness and awoke in Muwasa Hospital. It was not clear what
happened to Ali's brother.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the fire in the low-income Izbat Saad suburb has
not yet been determined.
</P>
<P>
   The dead included the commander of Alexandria's fire brigade,
Mohammed Ragaei, and another high-ranking civil defense official,
Ibrahim Abdel Qader.

<HEADLINE> Congress may reimburse Morris County agencies for protest cost  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Morris County, site of a World Bank conference
in April that drew three days of protest, would receive $500,000 in
reimbursement from the federal government under proposals endorsed
Thursday by congressional committees.
</P>
<P>
   The protest, which attracted about 200 demonstrators the weekend
of March 31-April 2, led to nine arrests for charges that included
trespassing and failing to disperse. Officials estimated the cost
to state, county and local police and other agencies, would exceed
$500,000, much of that for overtime payments.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., and Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen,
R-N.J., announced Thursday that the appropriations committees in
their respective chambers had approved more than $500,000 in
reimbursements.
</P>
<P>
   The provisions are included in House and Senate appropriations
bills to fund the Treasury Department in 2001. If approved by both
houses, the treasury bill will go to President Clinton for his
signature.
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg and Frelinghuysen, whose district includes much of
Morris County, said more than 740 officers from 46 local police
departments joined federal officers to protect conference
participants, local residents and property.
</P>
<P>
   Protest organizers had told police that at least 500 protesters
could be expected at the Hamilton Park Conference Center in Florham
Park. The conference was sponsored by the World Bank, International
Monetary Fund and the Brookings Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The rally was organized by a coalition of grass-roots groups
called the New Jersey/New York Mobilization for Global Justice. The
groups maintained that the World Bank and the IMF, charged with
improving life in developing countries, instead throws the
countries into debt while enriching corporations and degrading the
environment.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Treatments Studied  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- While new medicines have dramatically reduced the
chances of HIV patients developing AIDS, a new study indicates the
percentage who contract non-Hodgkins lymphoma has quadrupled since
the drugs were introduced six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   People infected with HIV are defined as having AIDS when their
immune systems become so weak that they get one of 26 illnesses,
including non-Hodgkins lymphoma, as well as pneumonia, brain
infections and some other cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Experts have known that the effectiveness of the new combination
drug therapy, called highly active antiretrovirals, varies
depending on which of the 26 AIDS-defining illnesses are involved.
Some experts have reported suspicions the new therapy doesn't work
as well for non-Hodgkins lymphoma as for the other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ''This paper is probably the most compelling data to date to
support that suspicion,'' Dr. Mark Jacobson, a professor and AIDS
specialist at the University of California-San Francisco, said of
the Danish study, published this week in the British medical
journal The Lancet.
</P>
<P>
   In defining whether an HIV sufferer has developed AIDS, the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control also considers a drop in the blood
levels of CD4 T cells -- the immune system's key infection fighters
-- to a level below 200 per cubic millimeter of blood.
</P>
<P>
   The highly active antiretrovirals were introduced in 1994 to
help prevent HIV patients from progressing to AIDS. They inhibit
the ability of HIV to reproduce itself in the blood, keeping down
the amount of the virus in the body.
</P>
<P>
   The cocktail has dramatically improved health and survival in
the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The Danish study of 7,300 European HIV patients found that even
if patients' CD4 cell count dropped well below 200, the new
combination therapy still protected them from AIDS-defining
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Badara Samb, care adviser at UNAIDS, a joint program of the
United Nations and the World Health Organization, called that
finding ''encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jens Lundgren, a professor at the University of Copenhagen
who led the study, said he found an overall drop in the progression
from HIV to AIDS of more than 90 percent, and the decline was
sustained year after year.
</P>
<P>
   Lundgren also found that the number of HIV-positive people
developing non-Hodgkins lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph glands, has
declined among people taking the new drugs, but not by as much as
other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   That means the cancer makes up a larger proportion of AIDS
diagnoses than it did before. In 1994, 4 percent of the progression
from HIV to AIDS was due to non-Hodgkins lymphoma. By the end of
the study, the disease accounted for 16 percent of AIDS diagnoses.
</P>
<P>
   The study speculated that using the combination drug therapy
earlier in the progression of HIV might prevent the cancer.

<HEADLINE> Sentenced reduced for Vineland man after Supreme Court decision  </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN SCHURR
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGETON, N.J. (AP) - A Vineland man whose sentence on a hate
crime conviction was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court is
expected to be released soon.
</P>
<P>
   State Superior Court Judge Rushton H. Ridgway on Thursday
reduced the sentence for Charles C. Apprendi Jr. from 12 years to
seven in the wake of a June Supreme Court ruling that the finding
that Apprendi was motivated by bias was improperly made.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said, because of the Supreme Courts' decision, the
longer sentence for a bias crime had to be vacated.
</P>
<P>
   Apprendi, who is white, was arrested in December 1994 after
eight shots were fired into the home of a black family living in
his otherwise all-white neighborhood in Vineland. No one was
injured.
</P>
<P>
   Apprendi, 45, admitted to the shooting, and at first he told
police he wanted to send a message to the family that they did not
belong in the neighborhood. Later, he said he was pressured into
making a false statement, and that he had no racial intent.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was criminal mischief, that's all it was,'' he said outside
court Thursday, adding that he was under the influence of drugs and
alcohol at the time.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's hate-crime law bans acts of racial or ethnic
intimidation, such as burning crosses or painting swastikas. It
provides stiffer sentences for such crimes as assault and
harassment if the defendant acted with a ''purpose to intimidate''
because of factors such as race, sex or religion.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled that a jury - not a judge alone - must
decide when bias is the motive behind a crime.
</P>
<P>
   The justices also said in such cases, the highest legal standard
- whether prosecutors offered proof beyond a reasonable doubt -
must be used. In imposing Apprendi's original sentence, the judge
said prosecutors showed by a ''preponderance of the evidence'' that
Apprendi's act was racially motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Ridgway reduced the sentence to seven years for weapons
violations and for possession of a bomb, which was found in
Apprendi's house.
</P>
<P>
   Apprendi already has served five years and seven months in
prison and halfway houses. His lawyer, Joseph D. O'Neill, said
Thursday that he would ask the state Department of Corrections to
release his client.
</P>
<P>
   Victim Mattie Harrell called his sentence ''a slap on the
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she will seek a restraining order barring Apprendi from
coming near her family or her home, which is less than 2 miles from
where he will live with his parents.
</P>
<P>
   Cumberland County Prosecutor Arthur Marchand said he will seek
that as a condition of Apprendi's parole. ''I think it's a fair
request,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harrell said with Apprendi's release imminent, ''I feel like the
horror is about to begin all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrell said one of the bullets came through her son's bedroom
and lodged in a hallway. Michael, 14, is still afraid to sleep in
his room, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''How do I explain to him that he has nothing to worry about,''
she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''I try to teach my children that we live in a country of
fairness and discipline,'' she said. ''If someone hurts you, they
will be punished for their actions. But now I feel I have to eat my
own words.''

<HEADLINE> Judge clears man convicted of 'bombing' ex-employer's computer programs </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A federal judge has thrown out a guilty
verdict against an industrial designer convicted of leaving his
ex-employer a computer ''bomb'' that erased critical programs.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge William H. Walls ruled that a juror who
contacted him after the trial was unfairly tainted because she
heard about an unrelated computer problem, the ''Love Bug'' virus,
after deliberations started, a prosecutor and defense lawyer said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney V. Grady O'Malley, said
Thursday that the ruling, issued July 14 from the bench, would be
appealed to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just hearing inadvertently about the 'Love Bug,' which is
really an insignificant piece of information, does not measure up
to what the 3rd Circuit has found to be sufficient to overturn a
verdict,'' O'Malley said.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy A. Lloyd is believed to be the first person to stand
trial under a new federal computer sabotage law.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Edward J. Crisonino, said that in 16 years as a
defense attorney this was the first case in which a trial judge
reversed a jury verdict against one of his clients.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's pretty rare,'' Crisonino said. ''It's very lucky on Mr.
Lloyd's part that the woman picked up the phone and called the
judge because we would never have known about it otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd, 37, of New Castle, Del. was convicted May 9 and faced up
to five years in prison, a fine of up to $250,000, and an order of
restitution at sentencing, which was scheduled for July 31.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities say Lloyd's actions caused Omega Engineering
Corp. to lose more than $10 million in sales, damage and lost
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Omega is based in Stamford, Conn., and Lloyd worked at the
office in Bridgeport, N.J. The company produces sophisticated
measuring devices and control equipment, including temperature
controls used by NASA rockets and Navy submarines.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd was convicted of intentionally damaging a computer, but
acquitted of the other charge he faced, taking about $50,000 of
Omega computer hardware and software to his home.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict came after 12 hours of deliberations over three days
following a three-week trial.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Gaudin, who covered the trial for Network World magazine,
said such cases are rare. ''It's pretty hard because companies
don't want to stand up and wave their hands and say, 'We've been
hit,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, ''It's a concern for any company out there
now, because so much of a company's enterprise is dependent on its
network,'' Gaudin said.
</P>
<P>
   The juror's name has not been made public, Crisonino said. She
called the judge several days after the verdict and said she heard
about the virus during a weekend break, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The information contributed to her guilty vote because it helped
her realize that physical access to a computer system was not
essential to cause a crash, the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I argued it was a taint because it was evidence that was not
presented to the jury, and we couldn't counter it,'' Crisonino
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd was Omega's file system administrator in August 1995, when
he was demoted. He began testing the computer bomb in February
1996, and was fired July 10, 1996, after 11 years with the company,
prosecutors said showed.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty days later, the bomb was unleashed as planned, deleting
and purging Omega's most critical manufacturing programs,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd did not testify at his trial. His defense maintained that
Lloyd did not cause the crash and that it is impossible to
determine who did, Crisonino said.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd remains under house arrest, but is allowed to travel daily
to do computer work at a Delaware machine shop, his lawyer said.
The lawyer said he did not know the company's name.

<HEADLINE> HUD Judge Awards $1M to Advocate  </HEADLINE>
By CLAUDE R. MARX
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge on Thursday awarded a former
fair housing advocate $1.1 million in damages from a neo-Nazi group
that displayed intimidating images of her on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Administrative Law Judge Alan Heifetz ruled that white
supremacist Ryan Wilson's neo-Nazi ALPHA HQ group had tried to
intimidate Bonnie Jouhari into not fighting housing discrimination.
Heifetz works for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, which filed the suit on behalf of Jouhari against
ALPHA HQ.
</P>
<P>
   Jouhari, who is white, worked for the Reading-Berks Human
Relations Council in Reading, Pa. and helped victims of housing
discrimination file complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, which can be appealed to another HUD official and
then to the U.S. Court of Appeals, awards damages for emotional
distress to Jouhari and her daughter. It also reimburses both women
for lost salary, moving expenses and the cost of therapy. Wilson
and his organization must also pay $33,000 in civil penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ''If dedicated and talented fair housing advocates can be
targeted, intimidated and harassed with impunity then the
enforcement mechanism of that (Fair Housing) Act will be rendered
impotent,'' Heifetz wrote in his decision.
</P>
<P>
   Jouhari said she felt so intimidated that she moved out of the
state with her daughter, Danielle Horton, who is biracial.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope today's decision serves as a deterrent to anyone else
who thinks they can get away with such torture,'' Jouhari said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   In May, a former Pennsylvania Ku Klux Klan leader agreed to pay
Jouhari and Horton 10 percent of his annual income for a decade and
apologize to them on his cable television program to settle a
federal discrimination lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Roy E. Frankhouser admitted that during his ''White Forum''
cable show, which airs in Reading, he displayed ''hateful'' images
of Jouhari from the ALPHA HQ Web site. One animated picture showed
Jouhari's office being blown up.

<HEADLINE> Clinton meeting with taxi driver president  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton said Thursday she
supports spending federal money on security partitions for New York
City's livery cabs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the comments on her way to a meeting with Fernando
Mateo, president of the New York State Federation of Taxi Drivers.
Ten livery cab drivers have been killed in New York City since
January.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am concerned about the real danger that livery cab drivers
find themselves in New York and the number that have been murdered
in cold blood this past year,'' Clinton told The Associated Press
in a telephone interview Thursday. ''We've got to do more.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady said she supports legislation sponsored by Sen.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y, and Rep. Jose Serrano, D-Bronx, that would
provide $600,000 in federal money for the purchase of bulletproof
partitions.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki signed legislation earlier this year
increasing the penalties for violence against cabbies. The law adds
three to five years to the sentences of anyone convicted of
attacking cab drivers.
</P>
<P>
   New York police earlier this year formed a task force to deal
with cab driver killings, and the city now requires all drivers to
install either partitions or security cameras in their cars.

<HEADLINE> Judge issues preliminary injunction on Princeton smoking ban  </HEADLINE>
By DERRICK HENRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A judge in New Jersey has blocked
enforcement of the state's toughest smoking ban and has given
parties in the case a week to supplement the arguments they
presented in court on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia-based National Smokers Alliance and three Princeton
bars and restaurants filed the lawsuit June 8, saying the Princeton
Regional Health Commission didn't have the authority to enact the
ban, which would restrict smoking to homes, cigar shops or
outdoors. Violators would face fines from $100 to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''This commission strayed from the law,'' said Ross A. Lewin, a
Princeton attorney representing the smokers alliance and the bars
and restaurants. In court, Lewin presented to Superior Court Judge
Linda R. Feinberg excerpts from five state statutes that said
groups such as the Princeton Regional Health Commission may only
suggest - and not mandate - guidelines about concerns such as
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   But Feinberg told Lewin, ''I don't think you can dispose of this
whole case on that particular condition. This case is more complex
than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Before issuing the preliminary injunction, Feinberg also said
the list of statutes to which Lewin referred ''isn't as ironclad as
the plaintiffs would have you believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, lawyers representing the Princeton Regional Health
Commission said the commission's move was legal because people have
a right to be free from secondhand smoke.
</P>
<P>
   The commission had the authority to enact the ban based on local
concerns about fire safety, said Robert J. Conroy, one of the
lawyers representing the commission and a coalition of 45 groups,
including the American Cancer Society and the Medical Society of
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a long history of local rule in New Jersey,'' Conroy
said.
</P>
<P>
   Conroy, who practices in Bridgewater, said in the past it has
been the intent of the Legislature to allow municipalities to enact
such ordinances, thus making the commission's actions legal.
</P>
<P>
   Feinberg also quizzed the defense lawyers about exceptions to
the ordinance, which in includes private clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The judge told defense lawyers to write a brief elaborating on
those exceptions. She also asked if the state's smoking statute
intended for municipalities to regulate establishments listed in
the ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think it (the case) is going to have implications statewide
because other towns are dealing with the same concerns,'' said
Karen L. Cayci, a Princeton lawyer who also is representing the
commission and the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the ban took exception to legal arguments against
it. They said they are more concerned with the effects of
secondhand smoke on people's health.
</P>
<P>
   Regina Carlson, executive director of New Jersey Group Against
Smoking Pollution, or GASP, said, ''We really want some protection
for our health, for our children.''
</P>
<P>
   One supporter explained the need for defending the ban with a
legal technicality.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're arguing within the points of a law that doesn't have the
benefit of scientific evidence,'' said Tara Fredreck, a spokeswoman
with the American Cancer Society Eastern Division. ''Really, the
only option for us is to go on the fire safety issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Conroy, one of the defense lawyers, said if the smoking ban is
thrown out, there could be a call for statewide legislation further
restricting where smoking can take place.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the citizens of this state will hold their legislators
accountable because they failed to act,'' Conroy said.
</P>
<P>
   Feinberg didn't set a new hearing date. She instead told lawyers
to file supplemental briefs by July 28.
</P>
<P>
   Other New Jersey towns, including Glassboro, Highland Park,
Lawrence Township, Marlboro, Secaucus and South Brunswick, restrict
smoking in a variety of sites, but none has a ban as sweeping as
Princeton's.

<HEADLINE> WW II Memorial Challenged Again  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The design for a World War II memorial planned
for a prominent spot on the National Mall won approval Thursday
from the U.S. Fine Arts Commission, unswayed by arguments it would
mar the vista and offered an unclear message.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, by a 6-0 vote, approved the design by architect
Friedrich St. Florian for the 7.4-acre site between the Washington
Monument and the Lincoln Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   The project faces a second design vote, by Aug. 3, from the
National Capital Planning Committee, which represents Congress and
government agencies. Approval also is needed for inscriptions and
the model for a central sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial would sit at the head of the Reflecting Pool in
front of the Lincoln Memorial, with 56 pillars, each 17 feet high,
and two large rainbow-shaped pools surrounding a sunken plaza.
Visitors would enter through two 41-foot-tall arches.
</P>
<P>
   Two fountains would send jets of water twice as high as the
pillars. Wind sensors able to reduce the flow would protect
visitors from the spray. Still, St. Florian said, trees and lawn
would occupy two-thirds of the site.
</P>
<P>
   A wall of gold stars would represent veterans killed in the war.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton dedicated the site five years ago, but no
ground has been broken. About $92 million had been raised, mostly
from private sources, of the estimated $100 million necessary to
complete the memorial. Former Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas is helping
lead the fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Some witnesses at Thursday's hearing contended the memorial
would spoil the sight line between the Lincoln Memorial and the
Washington Monument. The design was faulted for failing to convey a
clear message.
</P>
<P>
   J. Carter Brown, the commission chairman, compared the criticism
to that leveled early on against the Vietnam War Memorial. ''My
reply was just wait until you go and see it,'' Brown said before
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The design received support from Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., a
Vietnam War veteran who had criticized an earlier version.
</P>
<P>
   ''The design, from the granite pillars to the freedom wall, to
the field of gold stars to the fountains, waterfalls and
landscaping, are breathtaking and yet respectful of the existing
vistas,'' he wrote the commission.
</P>
<P>
   The chief opponent was Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of
Columbia's delegate in Congress. She favored a site in Constitution
Gardens alongside the Mall.
</P>
<P>
   ''It should not cross our collective minds to interrupt the
glorious and near-sacred space between the Washington Monument and
the Lincoln Memorial with any man-made object,'' Norton said at a
news conference before the commission's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Washington architect Robert Miller said the proposals would make
the Mall less grand.
</P>
<P>
   ''It takes the freedom and openness the World War II generation
fought to preserve -- the splendor of America's two-mile long
village green -- and loads it with symbols of privilege and
exclusion,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Architectural historian Judy Scott Feldman objects to the arches
-- one representing the Atlantic theater of war and the other the
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ''We in America take people -- Washington, Lincoln, Jefferson --
and they become symbols. His columns look like a battle graveyard
in France. They could be in Arlington cemetery,'' she said before
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   F. Haydn Williams, who testified Thursday on behalf of the
American Battle Monuments Commission, sponsor of the memorial, gave
a preview of some of the inscriptions to be considered.
</P>
<P>
   --''The war has produced total victory, a victory of liberty over
tyranny. We can now turn to the grave task of preserving the peace.
War must be abolished from the earth. Civilization cannot survive
another war.'' -- President Truman after Japan's surrender in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   --''Today the guns are silent. A great victory has been won. The
world is at peace. The mission has been completed.'' -- Gen. Douglas
MacArthur, who accepted Japan's surrender.

<HEADLINE> Police arrest man in concrete attack  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A 35-year-old man was arrested for allegedly
attacking an aspiring social worker with a 5-pound chunk of
concrete as she left a Manhattan church, police said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Police stopped Bently Louis Grant four days after the attack on
Tiffany Goldberg because he fit the description of the man they
were looking for, but let him go because there wasn't enough
evidence to hold him, said Commissioner Howard Safir.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said a witness to the attack later picked Grant's picture
out of a photo lineup. Officers arrested him in Brooklyn's Prospect
Park late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At least one witness also picked Grant out of an in-person
lineup. The suspect is believed to be homeless, with no known
criminal record, Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg, 25, suffered a cracked skull after an attacker sneaked
up behind her on July 9 and hit her with a piece of pavement. The
assailant allegedly tried to rob her before running away.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg, a native of Madison, Wis., also suffered chipped
teeth, a black eye, cuts and bruises when she fell.
</P>
<P>
   She had just left Marble Collegiate Presbyterian Church on 29th
Street and Park Avenue, where she sings in the gospel choir, when
she was hit.
</P>
<P>
   An off-duty firefighter, Lt. Jimmy Hurley, was driving by. He
gave up his chase of the attacker when he saw how badly Goldberg
was bleeding. He wrapped a white T-shirt around her head and held
her hand.
</P>
<P>
   Police said earlier that descriptions of the attacker appeared
to match that of a homeless man who frequented the neighborhood; a
city shelter is about two blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said Grant admitted to the crime in interviews with
police, and that the suspect would face charges of attempted murder
in the second degree, first-degree assault, and criminal possession
of a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate incident on Wednesday night, Anthony Gonsalves,
43, of Trumbull, Conn., had his right arm partially severed when a
2-foot-long concrete slab was thrown through his laundry truck
windshield from a Bronx highway overpass. Doctors at Bellevue
Hospital, where he was listed in critical but stable condition,
were working to reattach the arm.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, Nicole Barrett, then 27, was hit on the head with
a paving brick in midtown Manhattan while walking to work. She
underwent two brain operations and has returned to her family's
home in Athens, Texas, for rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   In May, a 30-year-old Queens woman was hit with a brick and
robbed.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Sides Make Cases Known  </HEADLINE>
By RON KAMPEAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Supporters and opponents of the Israeli and
Palestinian leaders stepped forward Thursday to make their cases
known before the two sides go back to the negotiating table at Camp
David.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish settlers commemorated a traditional fast day that recalls
the destruction of ancient Jerusalem by accusing Prime Minister
Ehud Barak of giving up the holy city in modern times. Palestinians
demonstrated urging Yasser Arafat to stand firm.
</P>
<P>
   At President Clinton's urging, the leaders remained at the
retreat near Washington for the weekend, although nine days of
intensive talks aimed at producing a permanent peace accord failed.
Talks are expected to resume when Clinton returns from an economic
summit next week.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli media said the sides were using the break to study
American proposals aimed at unraveling the knottiest disagreements,
over Jerusalem, borders and refugees.
</P>
<P>
   All sides were planning major demonstrations over the weekend.
Peace activists planned a prayer vigil by the Western Wall in
Jerusalem's Old City on Friday. A central square in Tel Aviv is to
be the scene of a mass demonstration against Barak Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Even in this overheated political culture, the rhetoric achieved
an unprecedented apocalyptic tone.
</P>
<P>
   Cabinet Minister Haim Ramon, a close associate of Barak, warned
of the grim alternatives to a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''An explosion in the talks can lead to other explosions which
might lead to bloodshed,'' Ramon told Israel's army radio.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish settlers also said they were preparing for Palestinian
violence if the summit failed.
</P>
<P>
   Settler leader Pinhas Wallerstein said his settlement recently
purchased nightvision equipment and telescopes for weapons. He is
also requesting additional bullet proof vests for settlement
security guards.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone understands Arafat wants a war between us and we need
to prepare ourselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The army confirmed that it had been providing extra training to
reserves soldiers who live on the settlements. Army chief of staff
Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz has said he fears an intensification of
violence if the talks fail.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians decried such warnings as provocative -- but
echoed them in their own predictions of what failure would bring.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the summit fails, we will enter a black era in the history
of peace process,'' said Communications Minister Imad Fallouji.
''And if we face any Israeli challenges, we are ready and all our
options are open.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Hamas, a militant Islamic group opposed to the
peace process and to Israel's existence, expressed hope the summit
would fail. Hamas planned its own mass rally in Gaza on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's supporters continued their daily demonstrations urging
him to stand firm on all issues, including the release of 1,600
Palestinians jailed by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Barak supporters maintaining a peace vigil in Tel Aviv led a
symbolic tour of sights where terror bombers had struck, arguing
that a comprehensive peace deal would end such agonies.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkish opposition leaders said that peace was a worthy goal,
but accused Barak of giving too much away too soon, citing reports
that he was ready for some Palestinian sovereignty in Jerusalem and
had offered about 95 percent of disputed territory.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition Likud party leader Ariel Sharon said those reported
concessions ''set a dangerous precedent that will create an
impossible starting point for future negotiations.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Debates Agriculture Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate debated Thursday night whether to
add $900 million in emergency aid to a farm spending measure, which
would come on top of a $15 billion agriculture bailout already
approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The package of 15 amendments would provide millions of dollars
for flood damage and other natural disasters and losses in
livestock, apples, potatoes and citrus crops. The bill already
contained $1 billion in emergency aid.
</P>
<P>
   The amendments drew fierce objections from several Republican
fiscal conservatives, who complained that the projected budget
surplus was leading lawmakers to wreck budget spending guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe this has gone too far,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas. ''We are letting this surplus burn a hole in our
pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   The $15 billion bill passed in May was aimed at beefing up crop
insurance programs and made $5.5 billion in direct cash payments to
growers suffering under low commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency aid amendments were among several offered to the
$75.3 billion annual agriculture spending bill now being debated in
the Senate. The House has passed a different version.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, the Senate narrowly rejected a measure aimed
at trying to resolve a dispute with a Texas beef processor over
government meat safety standards.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment offered to the agriculture spending bill by Sen.
Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, was aimed at a dispute involving the Department
of Agriculture and Supreme Beef Processors Inc., which supplies
ground beef to the national school lunch program.
</P>
<P>
   The department tried to close the facility last month after it
failed its fourth straight set of microbial tests, but a federal
judge in Texas barred the agency from using such test results to
force the closing of the facility. The judge agreed with the
meatpacking industry that testing for salmonella bacteria was not a
fair measure of whether a plant was sanitary.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin's amendment would have given the department the legal
authority to withdraw or suspend inspection from meat and poultry
plants that fail to reduce pathogens in their products. It failed
by a vote of 48-49.
</P>
<P>
   ''If USDA lacks the authority to enforce pathogen reduction
standards than surely we stand at the edge of a food safety
debacle,'' Harkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents wanted further study.
</P>
<P>
   ''This amendment, if we adopt it here, would impose a legal, a
new legal authority that's not now present,'' said Sen. Thad
Cochran, R-Miss. and the chairman of the Senate agriculture
appropriations subcommittee. ''That would give the Department of
Agriculture more power than it has. . . and more power than we
ought to on an appropriations bill without further review.''
</P>
<P>
   The House last month approved its $75.4 billion version of
agriculture spending. Once the Senate agrees to its bill, both
sides will have to work out any differences.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also faces a veto threat. The Clinton administration
has voiced concern about the current spending levels of food safety
and environmental issues in the congressional bills.
</P>
<P>
   A major difference in the House and Senate versions is a
provision in the Senate bill that would allow food and medicine
sales to Cuba. The House rejected the provision earlier but has
agreed to add a more restricted version in conference.

<HEADLINE> UN Announces Business Initiatives  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations on Thursday announced
the first members of a new corporate effort to promote human rights
and environmental standards in business.
</P>
<P>
   The list includes companies such as Nike and Shell, which have
been criticized for abuses overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights and environmental groups which have questioned the
growing U.N.-business affiliation immediately denounced the
so-called ''Global Compact,'' saying it could allow companies to
use the U.N. flag to clean their tarnished public images.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan launched the ''Global Compact'' in
January 1999, asking corporations to commit themselves to nine key
principles, including pledges to protect human rights, uphold the
rights of workers to unionize, eliminate child labor and develop
environmentally friendly technologies.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Annan warned that the principles were necessary to
uphold because corporations risked a backlash from those who
weren't benefitting from globalization -- a backlash which has since
borne out in protests in Seattle and elsewhere at global trade
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Next Wednesday, the United Nations will convene the first
meeting of the participants of the new partnership, which has
enlisted nearly 50 companies as well as labor organizations and
human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Lawyers
Committee for Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, the corporations will be asked to post examples of
progress they have made in implementing the nine principles on a
special U.N. website. The labor and human rights members of the
partnerships will be able to respond to those initiatives on the
same site.
</P>
<P>
   John Ruggie, Annan's special adviser, said this ''structured
dialogue'' between corporations and labor and human rights groups
could be a powerful force for change.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course you can't rule out anything, but I would be very
surprised if any one of these companies attempted to do a snowjob
on us,'' Ruggie told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Posner, executive director of Lawyers Committee for
Human Rights, said his organization had decided to join the
parnership reasoning that if corporations were willing to show up,
''we need to be there to say these are the things we think you need
to be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   However, a coalition of environmental groups including
Greenpeace International and human rights organizations from the
developing world sent a letter to Annan on Thursday asking that he
reconsider the ''Global Compact'' and instead focus on establishing
a binding legal framework to oversee the conduct of multinational
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Asking corporations to sign a vague statement ''draws attention
away from the need for more substantial action to hold corporations
accountable for their behavior,'' said the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Karliner, executive director of Transnational Resource
and Action Center, one of the letter's co-signers, said it was
particularly appalling that the first parners in the ''Global
Compact'' had such questionable records.
</P>
<P>
   Nike Inc., for example, has been targeted by labor organizations
for conditions at its factories in Asia. Shell has been criticized
for environmental degradation around its oil fields in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Dusty Kidd, vice president of corporate responsibility at Nike
said Nike wasn't looking for public relations points, noting that
labor groups were part of the U.N. forum. He said Nike was merely
looking to improve conditions at its plants.
</P>
<P>
   ''One thing we've learned the hard way is the sooner you start
talking about these issues the sooner you get solutions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Shell weren't answered Thursday.

<HEADLINE> GAO: Parks Put Costs Before Safety  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The wildfire that burned hundreds of homes in
Los Alamos, N.M., raged out of control in part because National
Park Service officials did not use bulldozers and chainsaws to
contain the blaze, congressional investigators reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office suggested the Park Service revise
its policy that firefighting efforts be the cheapest and least
environmentally damaging.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the Park Service ''generally agreed'' with the
recommendation. It was not immediately clear whether the agency
would change its policy. Park Service spokesmen did not return
telephone messages left Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The Park Service set a fire on May 4 to clear underbrush in
Bandelier National Monument. When that fire started getting out of
control, Park Service officials chose to set other fires to try to
contain it.
</P>
<P>
   One of the containment fires got out of control, becoming the
Cerro Grande fire that charred nearly 48,000 acres, destroyed more
than 200 homes and burned parts of the Los Alamos National
Laboratory, America's first nuclear weapons lab. Damage estimates
have ranged as high as $1 billion; President Clinton signed a $661
million fire compensation package last week.
</P>
<P>
   Using chainsaws and bulldozers to make a fire break ''was not
chosen because it would have been inconsistent with Park Service
policy calling for resource damage to be minimized,'' said the
report written by environmental expert Barry Hill of the GAO, the
investigative arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''The existing Park Service policy requiring fire managers to
protect resources while trying to suppress a wildfire should be
revised in instances like Cerro Grande,'' Hill wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''In these cases, where the threat of a prescribed fire's
getting out of control poses direct and serious public safety
risks, there should be no question that fire suppression should be
the top priority.''
</P>
<P>
   The Park Service has halted all prescribed fires in the West
because of the New Mexico fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   Bandelier Superintendent Roy Weaver retired this month and
apologized to Los Alamos citizens for approving the original fire.
Park Service officials have not determined whether anyone will be
disciplined.

<HEADLINE> Four Journalists Win Cabot Prizes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Four journalists, including The Associated Press
bureau chief for Mexico and Central America, will be honored for
excellence in reporting on Latin America, Columbia University said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Francisco Santos, a columnist for the Colombian
newspaper El Tiempo who lives in exile, is to receive a special
citation, Columbia said in announcing the 2000 Maria Moors Cabot
Prizes.
</P>
<P>
   Winners of the awards for outstanding coverage of Latin America
and the Caribbean are: Eloy O. Aguilar, AP bureau chief for Mexico
and Central America; Paul Knox, international affairs reporter for
The Globe and Mail of Toronto; Ricardo Uceda, chief of the
investigative unit at El Comercio, of Lima, Peru; and Lloyd
Williams, senior associate editor of the Gleaner newspapers of
Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   The Cabot awards, in their 62nd year, honor reporters and
editors who have ''demonstrated compassion and commitment to
freedom of the press and inter-American understanding,'' Columbia
said. They are administered by the university's Graduate School of
Journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Aguilar has been chief of the AP bureau in Mexico City since
1979, coordinating news and photo coverage of Mexico and Central
America. He has overseen coverage of wars in Guatemala, El Salvador
and Nicaragua and helped establish the AP's bureau in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Knox has written and edited for The Globe and Mail since 1978,
and is also a Spanish-language commentator for Radio Canada
International. He has reported from all over Latin America and the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Uceda, of El Comercio, has worked on investigations into alleged
election fraud, the disappearance and murder of a teacher and nine
students, and surgical sterilizations performed on pregnant women
without their knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who began his career in 1960 as a trainee at the Daily
Gleaner, is now senior associate editor of the Gleaner Publications
group. He recently wrote a series about Colombian drug traffickers
moving into Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   Santos was to receive a special citation for his columns in El
Tiempo, in which he has denounced kidnaping and massacres. He
survived a kidnapping a decade ago, and fled Colombia after writing
against guerrilla violence.
</P>
<P>
   The awards are to be presented Sept. 27 in a ceremony at
Columbia.

good as a six-story, 119-year-old wooden elephant gets.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years to the day after the rotting Victorian-era oddity
was moved to its current location, city officials and members of
the Save Lucy Committee gathered Thursday to pull the curtain on
the final phase of more than $1 million in renovations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Finally, this project has ended,'' said Margaret Westfield,
one of the architects who worked on the renovations.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1881 by real estate mogul James Lafferty as a gimmick
to attract buyers to what was then South Atlantic City, Lucy the
Elephant served - at various times - as a hotel, a summer cottage
and a tavern before being converted into a full-time tourist
attraction in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   It fell into disrepair in the 1960s, however, and had
deteriorated badly when, in 1969, a group of residents organized
the Save Lucy Committee to spare it from the wrecking ball. On July
20, 1970, the elephant was moved two blocks to its current location
on Decatur Avenue and the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, more than $1 million - in private donations and
historic preservation grants - has been spent to repair and
maintain the building. In 1997, it was designated a National
Historic Landmark.
</P>
<P>
   The latest phase of work, which cost $260,000, restored the
inside of the elephant, replacing the dilapidated wooden beams with
new hardwood floors, recessed ceiling lights and varnished
stairways and banisters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank you, thank you, thank you, a million times,'' beamed
Josephine Harron, president of nonprofit committee, who thanked
supporters during a 15-minute ceremony held beneath the giant
tusks.
</P>
<P>
   One first-time visitor was impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's definitely worth saving,'' said Michael Whalan, 48, of
Bailey's Crossroads, Va., as he descended the stairs in the
elephant's right rear foot, at the end of a tour. ''It's a little
bit silly, but it's fun. It's better-spent money than a lot of the
things they spend money on, like congressional junkets.''

<HEADLINE> Former casino security guard on trial in death of panhandler  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - A coroner's investigator testified
Thursday that there were visible signs of trauma when she arrived
to examine the body of an unruly gambler who was allegedly beaten
to death by a casino security guard.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Petty, 37, of Galloway Township is accused of aggravated
manslaughter and four counts of witness tampering in the Sept. 8,
1998 death of Hue To, 25, of Plainfield.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say To was ejected from the casino for panhandling
near a poker table. Petty allegedly beat him to death after taking
him into an office at Trump Plaza Hotel &AMP; Casino.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses say the 6-foot-1 inch, 240-pound Petty kicked the
5-foot-1 inch To, who weighed about 100 pounds, and threw him into
a door.
</P>
<P>
   The coroner's investigator, H. Louise Houseman, told jurors that
To's body had contusions on the abdomen, sternum, elbow and eyes
when she first saw it at Atlantic City Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a fellow former Trump Plaza guard testified that
she heard a crash from the room where Petty and To were, and that
another guard told her the man had died.
</P>
<P>
   ''She said, 'He's dead. Mark killed him,''' said Lisa Marie
Johnson, who is now an Atlantic County corrections officer. ''She
said that (Petty) kicked him like a football.''
</P>
<P>
   Petty is charged with persuading four other guards to lie for
him to cover up the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Waldron, 51, of Egg Harbor Township, an investigator for
Trump Plaza, also is charged with witness tampering. She threatened
the four, warning them not to tell the truth about what happened
because it would send Petty to jail and result in their firings,
according to First Assistant Prosecutor Ellen Loughney.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Petty faces 10 to 30 years in prison.

<HEADLINE> Appeals court dismisses Silver's suit vs. Pataki vetoes  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A Manhattan appeals court Thursday threw out a
legal challenge to Gov. George Pataki's right to exercise the
line-item veto on 55 items in the 1998-99 state budget sent him by
the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The Appellate Division, in a decision the judges called
unprecedented, ruled 3-2 that Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, the
Manhattan Democrat who filed the lawsuit, did not have standing to
challenge Pataki's vetoes.
</P>
<P>
   Reversing a lower court's January 1999 ruling, the majority
found that nothing in the state constitution gives the Speaker of
the Assembly the duty or the power to seek judicial review of
gubernatorial actions.
</P>
<P>
   At issue were the governor's vetoes of ''non-appropriations''
parts of the state budget. Pataki has line-item veto authority over
individual budget appropriations, and he vetoed some $1.6 billion
in legislative spending.
</P>
<P>
   Silver argued on behalf of the Assembly's Democratic majority
that Pataki abused his power by also deleting language pertaining
to the allocations and deciding unilaterally how the funds would be
spent.
</P>
<P>
   Silver said late Thursday that ''in all likelihood the case will
be decided by the Court of Appeals,'' the state's highest court. He
noted that two Appellate Division judges dissented and agreed with
the lower court.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a remark by the lower court judge, Justice Edward Lehner
of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, Silver said ''who better than
the Speaker to challenge the action's of the state's chief
executive?''
</P>
<P>
   ''We would have anarchy if the governor could do just anything
without the usual checks and balances,'' Silver said.
</P>
<P>
   But the appellate majority disagreed. They pointed to a
30-year-old case that held ''legislators, as legislators, are
unable to bring disputes regarding budgetary differences with the
governor into a court.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehner, a Democrat, noted the earlier decision but refused to
follow its reasoning, saying that if he did it would let Pataki
escape any ''judicial scrutiny'' of his vetoes, which is contrary
to the intent of other rulings.
</P>
<P>
   The majority, in a decision written by Justice John T. Buckley,
also said that allowing the speaker to sue the governor would
confer on him an authority that is contrary to the letter and
spirit of separate governmental powers.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Buckley wrote, allowing such a precedent ''will needlessly
propel the judiciary into future political conflicts.'' He scolded
the dissenters for ignoring prior rulings that mostly kept the
courts out of political fights.
</P>
<P>
   ''Logic and common sense counsel judicial abstinence, or at
least restraint, when a political dispute beckons, as this does,''
Buckley wrote.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Denver and Jacksonville emerged
Thursday night as the front-runners to sign defensive tackle Eric
Swann.
</P>
<P>
   Swann's agent, Steve Zucker, said the Jaguars and Broncos both
made offers to the 10-year veteran. Swann was waiting to see
whether the Carolina Panthers would make an offer, as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers have talked to Swann, but also negotiated with
Reggie White on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   With some down time available while the Panthers negotiate,
Zucker tried to convince Swann to take one more trip, to visit the
Baltimore Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   ''But he's not going to go,'' Zucker said. ''He doesn't want to
take any more trips.''
</P>
<P>
   A two-time Pro Bowl tackle for the Arizona Cardinals, Swann was
released last month and began shopping himself around the league.
</P>
<P>
   Zucker said he expects a decision Friday.

   RIBEIRAO PRETO, Brazil (AP) -- Kansas' Drew Gooden scored 15
points in a six-minute span of the second half Thursday and the
United States pulled away to a 105-81 victory over Panama in the
opening round of the World Championship for Young Men qualifying
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, which beat Uruguay 122-73 in its opener,
closes opening-round play Friday against Argentina, which is also

Young Men.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team closed the first half with a 15-7 run to go ahead
49-40. The lead was 71-58 when Gooden scored seven straight points
to spark a 10-2 run. Panama (0-2) got within 81-71 with 6:57 left
but Gooden scored eight points in a 10-3 run that sealed it.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Williams of Duke led the United States with 21 points,
while Gooden had 17 and Jason Richardson of Michigan State added
15. Michael Dunleavy of Duke and Kenny Satterfield each had 11
points.

<HEADLINE> New York GOP boss: Pataki is on Bush's short list ... maybe  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Gov. George Pataki is on Republican
presidential candidate George W. Bush's short list of possible
running mates, New York's GOP chairman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But less than an hour later, and after calls went out to Pataki
and the Bush campaign for comment, party leader William Powers
backtracked and said he really didn't know who was on the list.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference at the state Republican Party headquarters,
Powers said it was his understanding that the Texas governor was
considering three potential running mates.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's on the short list,'' Powers said when asked about Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he knew that, the state chairman smiled and said,
''Good sources.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a subsequent interview, Powers said he had ''no inside
information'' about Bush's deliberations over a running mate and
that his earlier comments were based largely ''on my speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, Pataki brushed off speculation Thursday that his
attendance at a fund-raiser for members of the California Assembly
signaled he is a serious vice presidential contender. California
and New York are key electoral states.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been out to California time and again to make speeches to
different political organizations, different civic organizations,''
he said shortly after a speech to members of the Lincoln Club of
Orange County. ''This has been set up for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's West Coast appearance came just as Bush told
reporters he was close to making a decision. Pataki is one of
several people said to be under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki could help Bush carry a state that hasn't been won by a
Republican presidential contender since Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pataki acknowledged he had met with Bush in recent
days, he refused to discuss details of their discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any conversations I may or may not have had with Gov. Bush
that are private are private,'' he said. ''I'm not speculating on
what may or may not happen, or what I may or may not do if
something may or may not have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said Bush has made it
clear that only his closest advisers know who is on his short list
of possible running mates.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, Powers said he had first heard last week
of Pataki's inclusion on Bush's short list of possible running
mates. The state party chairman noted that he had been in Texas
last week meeting with Bush campaign officials, but refused to say
if that is where his information about Pataki came from.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, at his news conference, Powers was coy about Pataki's
possible inclusion on the list, telling reporters at one point that
he based his statement on ''good instincts.'' He later amended that
to ''good sources.''
</P>
<P>
   The GOP leader said that while he would like to see Pataki as
Bush's running mate and felt the New York governor could help a
Bush-led ticket in New York and nationally, it wasn't clear who
Bush would pick.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he is unpredictable when it comes to something like
that,'' Powers said at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki is one of several names that have cropped up in recent
days as possible Bush running mates, but the Texas governor has
said that only he, his wife and his vice presidential search team
leader, former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, know who is really
under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   The New York governor met privately with Bush last Friday in New
Jersey and later in Manhattan to discuss the vice presidency and
other issues. Pataki has refused to talk about his discussions with
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   A potential stumbling block for Pataki when it comes to a spot
on the GOP ticket is his record as an abortion rights supporter.

<HEADLINE> Virginia Golfer Aces Two Holes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALEVILLE, Va. (AP) -- A 57-year-old retired policeman had two
holes-in-one within a half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   Freddie Crockett of Roanoke recorded the aces Monday at Ashley
Plantation Golf Club. The first came on the 336-yard, par-4 2nd
hole, where Crockett used a driver. He used a sand wedge for the
second on the 104-yard 4th hole.
</P>
<P>
   The aces were Crockett's first in 26 years of golf.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's simply unbelievable,'' Crockett said Wednesday. ''It's
just like you're numb. ... I had a couple of my buddies call me the
next day and say, 'You lying son-of-a-gun.' I said, 'Well, I've got
two people who I've never met before who saw it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Crockett finished with a 3-under 69, his best score ever.
</P>
<P>
   The odds the feat border on the incalculable, said Mancil Davis,
executive director of the Texas-based National Hole-in-One
Association. ''We get a handful per year,'' he said. ''The most we
ever got was eight.''

<HEADLINE> New Jersey attorney general sues Worldcom over ads  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - New Jersey is one of six states suing
long-distance carrier WorldCom Inc., alleging it deceives customers
in its advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General John J. Farmer sued the Clinton, Miss.-based
company, which changed its name earlier this year from MCI
WorldCom, over its television and direct-mail ads that tell
consumers they will pay only 5 cents per minute for long-distance
service. He claims that rates are much higher due to hidden costs.
</P>
<P>
   He also accused the company of switching customers to WorldCom
without their consent, a practice known as ''slamming.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Companies advertising and doing business in New Jersey must do
so truthfully,'' Farmer said. ''The state will step in whenever are
wherever our laws are not obeyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmer said the company's ''Five Cents Everyday'' program is not
available for toll calls made within New Jersey and is only
available from 7 p.m. to 6:59 a.m., but those facts were not
adequately disclosed to customers.
</P>
<P>
   He and other attorneys general also note the plan comes with a
service fee of $4.95 per month, a minimum long-distance charge of
$5, a carrier access charge of $1.46, and a federal fee of 7.2
percent of all long-distance calls.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for WorldCom said the company does not comment on
pending litigation.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom is a global telecommunications company with revenue of
more than $30 billion and operations in more than 65 countries.
</P>
<P>
   A few states sued AT&AMP;T and Sprint over their promotions for
similar offers.
</P>
<P>
   The other states filing lawsuits Thursday were California,
Connecticut, Missouri, Minnesota and Maine.

<HEADLINE> Chechens Said To Step Up Attacks  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Chechen rebels have intensified their
attacks on Russian troops in the past week in order to embarrass
Moscow at a high-profile international summit this weekend, a top
general said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Just since Wednesday, the guerrilla fighters killed seven
Russian soldiers and wounded 12 others with mines, sniper rifles
and roadside ambushes, the military command said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported that a troop
convoy came under attack just outside the Chechen capital of
Grozny. There was no immediate word on casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Russia for months has insisted that the rebels are on the verge
of defeat, but the guerrillas' hit-and-run attacks show they can
still inflict significant harm on the larger and better-equipped
Russian forces.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fighters become active when important political events are
expected in the international arena,'' deputy head of the general
staff Gen. Valery Manilov told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir Putin will attend the Group of Eight summit,
which includes the world's wealthiest democracies, this weekend in
Okinawa, Japan. His talks with other leaders there are expected to
focus on Russian debt, but also touch on criticism of Russia's
conduct in the 11-month-long war.
</P>
<P>
   Western governments and human-rights groups have repeatedly
criticized Russia for indiscriminately killing civilians in the
offensive and for alleged human-rights violations including summary
executions and rapes.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels attacked Russian positions 63 times in the past week,
Manilov said, about double the rate of previous weeks. Russian
forces lost 25 dead and 74 wounded in the last week, Manilov said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the rebels want world leaders to understand the war goes
on, and that they ''still exist.''
</P>
<P>
   The skilled guerrillas traditionally prefer summer offensives
against Russian positions, when they can take advantage of thick
greenery in forests on the mountain slopes for cover, and can
bivouac easily in the wild areas in the warm weather.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reports of rebels saying their actions this week
were linked with the summit.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview released last week, Chechen President Aslan
Maskhadov accused the international community of failing to
pressure Russia into negotiating a settlement, but did not mention
the Okinawa summit.
</P>
<P>
   Putin promised a quick victory when troops moved into Chechnya
last September, but the conflict has long since bogged down.
</P>
<P>
   Manilov, meanwhile, said the military will take countermeasures
to the stepped-up attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should react, and, as we say, carry out prophylactic
measures,'' to prevent attacks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   This has traditionally meant police searches for alleged rebels
in Chechen villages near where attacks took place.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, which withdrew its forces from Chechnya after a 1994-96
war, sent ground troops back in last September, following weeks of
airstrikes. The Kremlin said the renewed offensive was necessary
after Chechen-based rebels twice invaded the neighboring region of
Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   Russia also blames Chechen militants for a series of September
apartment bombings that killed some 300 people.

<HEADLINE> Runner Sam Perry Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHPORT, Conn. (AP) -- Sam Perry, who shared the world record
in the 60-yard dash with Bob Hayes, died after a lengthy illness.
He was 55.
</P>
<P>
   Perry, an attorney and former city councilman in Passaic, N.J.,
died Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, Perry, running for Fordham University, was clocked in
5.9 seconds for the 60 at the Millrose Games at Madison Square
Garden, tying the world record Hayes set the year before. Perry,
who was the national indoor champion in the 60 in 1963 and 1965,
ran another 5.9 in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Perry graduated from Fordham and Columbia University Law School.
He served as a councilman in his native Passaic for four years
before moving to Connecticut where he practiced law.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you look at his name on our record board, it is just
incredible,'' said Tom Dewey, Fordham's track coach since 1980.
''These kids don't know about Sam till we show them the pictures.
His performances were tremendous. He still holds school records and
we have kids who have run fast, but I don't know if his records
will ever be broken.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry is survived by his wife, Beverly, two daughters and a son.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral services will be Saturday morning at the Union Baptist
Church in Passaic.

<HEADLINE> Actor Patrick Joins 'X-Files'  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Robert Patrick, who played the evil
liquid-metal cyborg opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger in ''Terminator
2: Judgment Day,'' is joining ''The X-Files'' next season, filling
the gap in the episodes that star David Duchovny will be sitting
out.
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny will appear in 11 of the new season's 20 episodes under
a new deal that will pay him more money per episode and settle the
actor's lawsuit over ''X-Files'' profits. Duchovny had been seeking
more free time from the series shooting schedule.
</P>
<P>
   His character, FBI agent Fox Mulder, was abducted by aliens in
the season finale, setting up Duchovny's reduced role for the Fox
series' eighth season.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick will appear in all 20 episodes as FBI agent John
Doggett, a former policeman assigned to help in the search for
Mulder, series creator Chris Carter said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not a replacement for David,'' Carter said. ''He's a new
character coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Shooting begins next week and the season opener will air in
November, Carter said.

<HEADLINE> Puerto Rican Lawyer Given 5 Years  </HEADLINE>
By MANUEL E. RIVERA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- A prominent lawyer was sentenced
Thursday to five years in jail for conspiring to steal $2.2 million
in U.S. funding meant for AIDS patients in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Dubon Otero, who was convicted of fraud in February, was
also ordered to repay $1.5 million stolen from the now-defunct San
Juan AIDS Institute as well as a fine of $125,000.
</P>
<P>
   Dubon's lawyer, David Roman, immediately said he would appeal
the sentence, calling it ''unjust and disproportionate.''
</P>
<P>
   Dubon, 65, was legal adviser for the institute and served on its
board, which received about $15 million from the Ryan White
Foundation, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the U.S. Health
Department before it folded in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said he decided on the maximum penalty because Dubon
was one of the masterminds and had destroyed documents in an
attempt to avoid prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, Fuste sentenced the institute's operations
manager, pharmacist Jeannette Sotomayor, to three years and 10
months imprisonment. She was ordered to repay the nearly $36,000
she had the institute pay in wages to her personal housekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen institute officials have been convicted in the case --
found guilty of diverting funds for personal use and political
campaigns between 1988 and 1994. Most pleaded guilty. Dubon was the
last to be sentenced.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal rocked this U.S. territory's government and forced
Gov. Pedro Rossello and former San Juan Mayor Hector Luis Acevedo
to take the stand to deny witnesses' allegations that they accepted
part of the stolen money. Both denied the claims and neither was
charged with any crime.
</P>
<P>
   The institute's director, Cuban Dr. Yamil Kouri, got the
toughest sentence of 14 years in prison. He was fined $17,500 and
ordered to pay back $1.3 million.

<HEADLINE> Warner Reports to Rams Camp  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM
<TEXT>
<P>
   MACOMB, Ill. (AP) -- Kurt Warner is not interested in contract
leverage.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL MVP reported to the Super Bowl champion St. Louis Rams'
training camp Thursday, a day before the first full-squad workout,
without a contract. The Rams were unable to come to an agreement on
a long-term deal before camp, so the quarterback said he'd sign a
tender offer for $358,000, the minimum for a veteran with two
years' experience, for now so that he could practice with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Two-a-day workouts begin Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to miss anything,'' Warner said. ''That's why I
came here, to practice from Day 1 and show my teammates that I
wanted to be here. I will definitely sign something so I can be out
there to practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner threw 42 touchdown passes last year in his first season
as a starter, after beginning training camp as an unknown
third-stringer. Before last year, he had made his mark only in NFL
Europe and Arena Football.
</P>
<P>
   Warner said his agent, Mark Bartelstein, advised him not to
report.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would say I wanted to make sure he understood all the risks
that were involved,'' Bartelstein said. ''What he's doing, to me,
it's unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's basically trusting that this thing will be done, and
that's the way he's run his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Why did he do it?
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of my love of the game and my responsibility to this
team and my teammates and coaches outweighs everything else,''
Warner said. ''I definitely want to take care of my family, but I
realize why I'm here. It's something I felt I had to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner said his decision had nothing to do with the state of
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope we're close; it seems like we're close,'' he said.
''But you know when you're negotiating some things that seem like
they're close are a long ways away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams and Bartelstein have discussed four-, five- and
seven-year deals, but Bartelstein said it's all fallen short.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're talking about the MVP of the league,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Warner said he wasn't worried about the potential risks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel this is what I'm all about, and this is more important
to me than everything else,'' Warner said. ''Hopefully it all gets
all worked out, but this is more important to me right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams also signed first-round pick Trung Canidate, a running
back from Arizona, to a five-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Canidate, expected to practice Friday, set a school
single-season record last year with 1,602 yards, and averaged 6.3
yards per carry with 11 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm really glad that we've got him for the first practice,''
coach Mike Martz said. ''Any rookie that misses any playing time,
it's magnified considerably. They get behind the 8-ball and spend
all year trying to catch up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams also signed third-round pick John St. Clair, a center
from Virginia. St. Clair signed Thursday afternoon and showed up at
the Rams' high-rise dormitory about 8:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''Luckily, everything worked out,'' St. Clair said. ''I don't
want to miss any camp. You never want to be behind.''

<HEADLINE> Lawyer wants charges against teacher dismissed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.Y. (AP) - The lawyer for a teacher accused of
videotaping his kindergarten students as they undressed wants the
charges dropped because the state's voyeur laws do not cover such
an act.
</P>
<P>
   Michael S. Dorrington, 26, of Geneva, was charged with five
counts of endangering the welfare of a child last month. Police
said Dorrington hid a video camera in a storage closet in his
classroom, then told five girls to go inside and change into
bathing suits as part of ''Water Fun Day'' at Lincoln Elementary
School.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Dorrington later dropped the camera and brought it
to a repair shop. When the repairman fixed the camera and viewed
the tape, he called police.
</P>
<P>
   Geneva lawyer Michael Roulan on Wednesday said the state's only
law against video voyeurism applies to owners or managers
videotaping patrons, guests or employees in bathrooms, changing
rooms or any other private area of a business or other
profit-making establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Roulan also said that since Dorrington never thought the tape
would become public, there was no injury to the girls who were
taped.
</P>
<P>
   ''No logical argument can be made that any of these students
were ever in a danger which would likely be injurious to them or to
their mental health,'' said Roulan. ''The conduct that is
attributable to Mr. Dorrington cannot be said to be such that he
knowingly thought that this tape would become public.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents of the five young girls who were videotaped said the
motion for dismissal is a ''slap in the face.''
</P>
<P>
   Village Justice Bruce Chambers ordered Dorrington to return to
court Aug. 2.

<HEADLINE> House Debates Cuba Restrictions  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House debated Thursday whether to allow
unrestricted sales of U.S. food and medicine to Cuba and travel
there by Americans, moves that supporters said would help weaken
Fidel Castro's communist rule.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals, pushed by an alliance of conservative, liberal,
business- and farm-state lawmakers, were the latest congressional
battle this year over removing some of the four-decade-old trade
barriers between the United States and the Caribbean island nation.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, farm-state lawmakers led by Rep. George
Nethercutt, R-Wash., tried to lift the food and medicine embargo
against Cuba but ran into opposition by Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides agreed to a compromise last month that House GOP
leaders have promised to try pushing into law. Supporters said that
if the House voted on Thursday to ease the restrictions, it would
strengthen Nethercutt's hand in getting his compromise enacted.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Castro legislators said allowing Cuba to receive more U.S.
trade and tourists would help prop up his regime.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., said the revenue Cuba would
gain from easing the restrictions would help ''the worst violator
of human rights in all of the Western Hemisphere.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Where's your compassion'' for the Cubans and Americans Castro
has killed? asked House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, who was a
chief opponent to Nethercutt's effort earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   But sponsors of easing the trade and travel embargoes said the
result would be to accelerate the drive toward freedom in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan ''allowed Americans with backpacks to travel in
Eastern Europe, and it did help bring down the Berlin Wall,'' said
conservative Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., chief sponsor of the
language easing the travel restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Personal freedom follows economic freedom,'' said Rep. Jerry
Moran, R-Kan., who conceded that lifting the food embargo would
help his farm-state constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of medicine to Cuba have been allowed since 1992 with
certain restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of an easing of travel restrictions last year by the
Clinton administration for students, athletes, artists and others,
the government says about 82,000 Americans flew to Cuba last year.
That was a 47 percent over the 55,900 who did so in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement last month between House GOP leaders and
Nethercutt, Americans could sell food and drugs to Cuba -- but only
if the Cubans paid for them with cash or with credit from a third
country.
</P>
<P>
   The prohibition against financing by the U.S. government or U.S.
banks was seen by many critics, including some farm-state
lawmakers, as meaning that little trade would actually occur as a
result of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   That agreement would also write into law an existing ban on U.S.
tourist travel to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., has said he opposes
the compromise, but President Clinton has said he would probably
sign it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration decided a year ago to allow sales of food
and medicine to Iran, Libya and Sudan but was barred by law from
easing the embargo on Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The provisions the House debated Thursday were offered as
amendments to a measure financing the Treasury Department and other
smaller agencies in the coming fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate version of the bill has no language affecting trade
with Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Giants 7, Padres 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Jeff Kent hit a three-run homer, raising
his league-leading RBIs total to 88, to help Kirk Rueter and the
San Francisco Giants beat the San Diego Padres 6-3 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Kent's 24th homer was his first since July 2 and snapped a
season-high six game streak without driving in a run.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Davis also homered for the Giants, who won for the 14th
time in 17 games and avoided their first two-game losing streak
since losing the last three games in June.
</P>
<P>
   Rueter (7-5) won for the fifth time in six decisions, allowing
three runs -- one earned -- and five hits in a season-high 7 1-3
innings. Aaron Fultz finished with hitless relief for his first
major league in three chances.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Williams (4-3) lost for the first time since May 1, a few
days before going on the 15-day disabled list with an aneurysm
under his right armpit. Williams, making his third start since
coming off the DL, allowed six runs and six hits in seven innings
and struck out six.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who had a career-high three hits, also drove in both
San Diego runs with his first career homer. Ruben Rivera reached on
Davis' error at third ahead of the homer.
</P>
<P>
   Kent gave the Giants a 3-0 lead in the first after Marvin Benard
singled and Barry Bonds walked.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' homer cut the lead to 3-2 in the fifth, but Davis
responded with a two-run shot in the bottom half and J.T. Snow
singled home a run later in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Fultz balked in a run in the eighth, but struck out Ryan Klesko
with a runner on third to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Mirabelli had an RBI single in the eighth off Carlos
Almanzar.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Giants OF Ellis Burks missed his second straight game with
pain in his right knee. ... The last Padres pitcher to hit a home
run had been Joey Hamilton on July 12, 1998, at Los Angeles. ...
Williams' error in the second was the Padres' first in seven games
(65 2-3 innings).

<HEADLINE> Isiah Thomas Named Pacers Coach  </HEADLINE>
By HANK LOWENKRON
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Isiah Thomas was hired by the Indiana Pacers
on Thursday, and like the man he replaced, he starts his first NBA
head coaching job with no bench experience.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Larry Bird did in 1997, Thomas takes over the Pacers as
a Hall of Famer, former Indiana college star and rookie coach.
</P>
<P>
   ''We chose Isiah by the qualities that he has a person, and as a
player,'' Pacers president Donnie Walsh said. ''I feel he's got the
leadership, intelligence and determination to be successful as an
NBA coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas reportedly signed a four-year, $20 million contract, but
he and Walsh declined to discuss terms.
</P>
<P>
   There had been speculation that Thomas had the job since the
season ended with Indiana losing to the Los Angeles Lakers in Game
6 of the NBA Finals. But Walsh and Thomas insisted the decision was
not final until early Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ''Like Larry Bird, this is not a spur-of-the-moment decision by
Isiah to pursue a role like this,'' Walsh said. ''He's been
preparing for coaching for a long time and he comes in with a full
idea of what he would like to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers were unable to persuade Bird to stay beyond his
original three-year commitment, even though they reached the NBA
Finals this season for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas brings instant recognition earned through his 13 years as
a player in the NBA, 12 as an All-Star. Four years ago, he was
selected as one of the league's 50 greatest players.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm looking forward to the challenge, looking forward to the
opportunity and looking forward to the continued success of Indiana
basketball. Let's go,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, 39, was told by NBA officials that he had to sell his
ownership of the Phoenix-based CBA, a nine-team developmental
league, to accept any NBA coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Thomas paid off at least part of the $750,000
he owed CBA team owners -- reported to be the last obstacle before
he could coach the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas bought the CBA in October for $10 million, but has worked
out an agreement which will allow him to quickly divest himself and
begin coaching duties with Indiana immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas has signed a letter of intent to sell the league to the
NBA Players Association.
</P>
<P>
   Pacers general manager David Kahn said a procedure had been
worked out allowing Thomas to divest himself from the CBA before
the team opens training camp in October, even if the deal with the
Players Association fell through.
</P>
<P>
   ''The combination of Isiah Thomas and his willingness to divest
himself from the CBA, and David Kahn's working it out ... has
basically allowed this moment to take place,'' Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn declined to be specific about the specifics of the
divestment, but said he was satisfied that there is a procedure in
place.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, Pacers assistant Rick Carlisle and former Pacer Byron
Scott, then an assistant at Sacramento, were considered for the
coaching job when Bird left. Scott eventually accepted the head
coaching job at New Jersey, leaving Thomas or Carlisle to follow
the franchise's best three-year run in its 24-year NBA history.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas's link to the state goes back more than 20 years, to when
he was recruited out of his hometown of Westchester, Ill., to play
for Bob Knight at Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand how special a place Indiana is with its
basketball tradition in terms of its basketball heritage,'' Thomas
said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas will begin working immediately, heading to Boston where
the franchise's summer league team is competing. He also plans to
quickly contact players, including the six who became free agents
this month: starters Reggie Miller, Jalen Rose, Mark Jackson and
Rik Smits, along with reserves Austin Croshere and Sam Perkins.
</P>
<P>
   ''My job is to continue to develop our young players, to get the
most and best out of our veterans and to lead this team and
organization to a level that it has not reached,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-1, baby-faced point guard was so good with the
Hoosiers he was given -- or took -- almost free rein, a rarity in
Knight's controlled style of play. After playing on the
Knight-coached Pan American Games championship team in 1979, he
averaged 14.6 points as a freshman and 16.0 as a sophomore, when he
was a first-team All-America and led the Hoosiers to the NCAA
title.
</P>
<P>
   Then he decided to pass up his final two years of college
eligibility and was the second pick in the first round of the 1981
draft -- behind hometown friend Mark Aguirre. He signed with the
Detroit Pistons for a reported $1.7 million for four years. He had
31 points and 11 assists in his NBA debut against the Milwaukee
Bucks.
</P>
<P>
   He eventually completed work at Indiana for a degree in criminal
justice in 1988, and retired as a player after the 1994 season with
18,822 points, 9,061 assists and 1,861 steals -- all Pistons records
-- along with NBA championship rings in 1989 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
   He averaged 19.2 points and 9.3 assists over his 979-game NBA
career.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas became vice president and part-owner of the Toronto
Raptors and more recently worked as an NBC analyst on NBA games.
</P>
<P>
   He was voted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in May and will be
inducted in October.

<HEADLINE> 'Big Brother' Guest Kicked Out  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The first of 10 people whose lives are being
followed by dozens of television cameras in the CBS ''Big Brother''
house was kicked out Thursday -- and he certainly wasn't broken up
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes! Yes!'' William said when he learned, on live TV, that
viewers had given him the boot.
</P>
<P>
   William, a 27-year-old youth counselor from Philadelphia, was a
provocateur who spent much of his two weeks fighting with fellow
residents. He said later that it was ''too prissy'' and ''I'm used
to playing roughhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS has been airing ''Big Brother'' five nights a week, and will
add another night next week as the series continues through late
September. The series that follows the social experiment of putting
strangers in a wired house has garnered mediocre ratings and
criticism that it's too dull.
</P>
<P>
   It was a little slow inside the house, too.
</P>
<P>
   William admitted that he tried to pull a prank on his fellow
residents -- pretending they'd been ordered to rearrange the
furniture -- because ''I was going crazy with the boringness.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There's only so much reading you can do, only so much
weightlifting ... I thought I'd work on some people's heads,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He also sabotaged a challenge by deliberately losing a game that
his housemates were playing to win more supplies, and was involved
in an expletive-laden, racially tense shouting match with Eddie, a
college student.
</P>
<P>
   Neither viewers nor his fellow residents appreciated it. Along
with Jordan, a 26-year-old former stripper, he was one of two
people nominated by the housemates to be expelled. Viewers chose
between them by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   William was voted out by a nearly three-to-one margin. CBS would
not divulge how many people voted.
</P>
<P>
   He said later he ''wouldn't change a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm used to being number one -- either first one out or last
one out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   CBS ''Early Show'' newsreader Julie Chen anchored the one-hour
live show. The CBS News employee has been criticized for playing an
entertainment role, most recently when her counterpart on NBC's
''Today'' show, Ann Curry, told TV critics Wednesday, ''I would not
have chosen to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last five minutes, Chen brought up a New York Daily News
report that said William, who also goes by the name Hiram Ashantee,
is a follower of ousted Nation of Islam leader Khalid Abdul
Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was a member of the New Black Panther Party for
Self-Defense and complained that Chen gave him only a brief
commercial break to look over the Daily News story and comment on
it.
</P>
<P>
   After he learned he was leaving, William picked up his bags and
left the house without saying goodbye. That's when most of the
people he had spent two weeks with appeared at the doorway to watch
him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh,'' he said. ''Later.''

   ITOMAN, Okinawa, Japan (AP) -- Pivoting from the Mideast peace summit,
President Clinton stopped Friday on the hallowed ground of the last major land
battle of World War II and sought to soothe long-simmering tensions over the
huge American military presence on Okinawa. ''We take seriously our
responsibility to be good neighbors, and it is unacceptable to the United States
when we do not meet that responsibility,'' Clinton said in prepared remarks. He
pledged to complete a process of consolidating U.S. bases on Okinawa and ''to
reduce our footprint on this island.'' Clinton is attending the Group of Eight
summit in Okinawa, which runs through Sunday.

Bush Considers Foreign Policy Team
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- GOP presidential hopeful George W. Bush says he would pack
his foreign policy team with heavyweights who saw the nation-- and his father--
through the Cold War, such as George Shultz, Henry Kissinger and Colin Powell.
''These are all people that stood by my side when I talked about nuclear
security'' last spring, Bush said during an interview for CNN's Larry King Live.
''Some of whom, you know, may be a part of the administration, but all of them
are my supporters and friends.''

   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Vanquished primary rival John McCain has told a
prominent Republican governor and mutual friend of George W. Bush that he would
be willing to serve as the Texan's running mate, sources said today. McCain, who
has previously ruled out a vice presidential bid, signaled his change of heart
in a telephone conversation this week with Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, amid a
series of developments abruptly raising McCain's profile as Bush draws close to
deciding, three GOP officials said. Ridge has been considered a top candidate
for the job, but told McCain that he didn't think he was still in the running,

   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- The Mideast summit, resurrected only hours after its
reported demise, moved forward today with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
stepping in for the traveling President Clinton. ''She will try to close the
gaps'' that loom large between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, her spokesman said. With the summit in its 10th day,
wearniess loomed as a factor. Shortly after the White House announced late last
night that the summit had ended without agreement, Barak and Arafat reversed
course and decided to stay at Camp David, Md., while Clinton attended a
three-day economic summit conference in Japan.

<HEADLINE> Teams Calling For Cuban BB Player  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME HERNANDEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Cuban baseball star Andy Morales had not even been
released from government detention when he was already being
courted by major league teams, according to his agent.
</P>
<P>
   Morales, who came ashore near Key West on Tuesday with eight
other migrants, was released to family members on Thursday evening,
after his immigration paperwork was processed at the office of U.S.
Catholic Conference Migration and Refugee Services.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am happy to be here. I am just very nervous from the trip,''
Morales said Thursday after being examined at a county clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Morales, 24, said he would hold a news conference Friday. He was
planning to stay in Miami with his father-in-law, Carlos Castillo,
while he pursues his baseball career.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in sneakers, dark-green jogging pants and a T-shirt,
Morales stepped out of a white county van, kissed his fingers and
touched the ground as members of the media watched as he was
transported to the clinic.
</P>
<P>
   His agent, Gus Dominguez, followed the van in a white Cadillac,
cell phone in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the way over here, we got three phone calls from major
league teams, wanting to confirm that Andy was here, and asking us
to call them,'' Dominguez said, declining to name the teams.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're elated, and happy for him and his family,'' Dominguez
said, adding that Morales had no team preference. ''Right now we
are just taking it day by day.''
</P>
<P>
   Morales' wife Daiyana and their 7-month-old son remain in Cuba
awaiting approval from that government to leave for the United
States, said Rene Guim, a publicist for Dominguez.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban government, on live television Thursday, said the
Morales' emigration underscores deep contradictions in U.S.
migration policy toward Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''This shows the immorality and the criminality of the killer
Cuban Adjustment Act,'' declared Lazaro Barredo, a journalist for
the weekly communist workers newspaper, Trabajadores.
</P>
<P>
   News of Morales' U.S. arrival came in the middle of a campaign
by Fidel Castro's government against the Cuban Adjustment Act, a
U.S. law passed in 1966 at the height of the Cold War. It allows
any Cuban who reaches American soil to avoid deportation and apply
for permanent residency after a year.
</P>
<P>
   It was that law that the Castro administration blamed for the
international custody dispute over 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, who
returned to the island late last month after his Miami relatives
lost their seven-month legal battle to keep him in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Morales, a third baseman, caught the eye of baseball fans when
he hit a home run in Baltimore last year in the Cuban national
team's 12-6 victory over the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Guim says no decision has been made about Morales going to
another country to try to get a work visa so he can negotiate with
major league clubs as a free agent. Otherwise, Morales would have
to enter baseball's amateur draft and risk being selected by a team
he might not want to play for.
</P>
<P>
   ''That decision is up to Andy,'' Guim said. ''He can do whatever
he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Morales looks to join other Cuban national team members who have
defected to play baseball in the United States. They include New
York Yankees pitcher Orlando ''El Duque'' Hernandez, his half
brother, San Francisco Giants pitcher Livan Hernandez, and New York
Mets shortstop Rey Ordonez.
</P>
<P>
   Morales tried to enter the United States last month, along with
30 other Cuban nationals, but they were refused asylum and sent
back to Cuba after being picked up at sea by a Coast Guard cutter
near Key West.
</P>
<P>
   Under a ''wet-foot, dry-foot'' policy, Cubans who actually land
in the United States are generally allowed to stay after a brief
immigration process.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials had insinuated after his first, unsuccessful
attempt to leave Cuba that Morales was not a great player. Those
insinuations continued this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''Luckily, here there are 10 third baseman who are equal to or
better than Andy Morales,'' Cuban television journalist Reinaldo
Taladrid said on Thursday's government broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the U.S. Border Patrol, which found Morales and the
others on a deserted island in the western Florida Keys, is still
investigating the possibility that they might have been smuggled in
on a speed boat for up to $5,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   ''Several Cubans have come forward and said they paid or were
going to pay that amount to be smuggled into the U.S.,'' said
Border Patrol spokesman Joe Mellia.

<HEADLINE> Fox Hires Risk Management Firm  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The network that pioneered the reality
TV genre doesn't quite trust itself after the ''Who Wants to Marry
a Multimillionaire'' disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has hired Price Waterhouse as a ''risk management firm'' to
advise whether some future reality shows cross the boundaries of
bad taste, network head Sandy Grushow said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The company will conduct background checks of reality show
participants and even watch over production, Grushow said.
</P>
<P>
   Grushow is trying to distance Fox from cheesy shows like
''World's Most Dangerous Animals.'' After the quickie marriage of
Rick Rockwell and Darva Conger fell apart on ''Multimillionaire,''
the network has moved cautiously into a programming area dominated
by CBS this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very difficult to create objective standards by which to
conduct one's business in this area,'' Grushow told reporters.
''It's very subjective.
</P>
<P>
   Whether something is appropriate to air is ''like the old
Supreme Court definition of pornography -- you know it when you see
it,'' he said. ''And it's our jobs to make sure that we're policing
our own airwaves.''
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Fox premieres ''American High,'' a summer-run series
showing the true-life experiences of students in a Chicago-area
suburban high school. It will also air ''The Sexiest Bachelor in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Among series in the works at Fox are ''I Want a Divorce,'' in
which real-life couples who are splitting up compete for their
shared property, and ''Master Game,'' a game show in which
contestants battle fatigue like students cramming for college
finals.
</P>
<P>
   But consider the shows that Fox had developed but that Grushow
said have been permanently shelved: ''World's Meanest Ladies,''
''Plastic Surgery Nightmares'' and ''Cheating Spouses Caught on
Tape.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox executives admitted that they -- and other networks -- passed
on the CBS hit ''Survivor'' when it was offered a year and a half
ago. No explanation was given.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has suffered in the ratings this year, with the new comedy
''Malcolm in the Middle'' one of the few bright spots. Its schedule
underwent the biggest overhaul of the broadcast networks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all know we're at the beginning of a major rebuilding
process,'' Grushow said.

<HEADLINE> Delegate Booted From Convention  </HEADLINE>
By GINA HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Her race and Mississippi's once
whites-only political machine kept Mamie Cunningham out of the 1964
Democratic National Convention. This time gender will sideline her
at the party's presidential bash.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham was pulled as a delegate to next month's 2000
convention in Los Angeles because Mississippi's racially diverse
delegation would have had two more women than men.
</P>
<P>
   The north Mississippi school teacher, elected a delegate in May,
was told this week she will be making the trip as an alternate.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a purpose for the rules. The people who were not
represented in the past, now they are represented,'' said Balwant
Singh of Pascagoula, who challenged the delegate selections.
''Women were ignored in the past, now they have rights. Blacks were
ignored, now they have rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh was mainly contesting his failure to make the delegation,
but a review found the gender imbalance. The retired educator is
Asian American, and he said the delegation includes only black and
white men although one slot is traditionally reserved for someone
from another race.
</P>
<P>
   The ouster is reminiscent of Cunningham's last convention
experience, when as a college coed she joined black Freedom
Democrats in a convention trip to challenge the all-white regular
state party for refusing to accept black delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham recalls being an observer in a group that included
Fannie Lou Hamer and other civil rights activists. She said they
watched the convention in Atlantic City from ''the window out on
the street and the boardwalk, picking up bits of information from
people who had been inside.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Democratic convention, ''I'm going to be more or less an
observer again,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders replaced Cunningham with state Sen. David
Jordan of Greenwood after Singh filed his challenge with the
Democratic National Committee and the presidential campaign of Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders said that if the state delegation does not meet
gender guidelines, delegates could risk not being allowed at the
convention. The DNC notified Mississippi officials about the
problem last week.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, a 58-year-old mother of three who teaches in
Aberdeen, was a student at Rust College in 1964 when she went to
the convention against her parents advice.

<HEADLINE> At Least 22 Dead in Colombia Clash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Clashes between leftist rebels and rival
militias left at least 22 people dead on Thursday, most of them
rightist paramilitary fighters, local officials and clergy
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Alejandro Munera, the Roman Catholic priest in Santa Rita,
a village in northwest Antioquia State, reported that the bodies of
19 militia members and two civilians had been found.
</P>
<P>
   Jaime Diaz, the mayor of the nearby town of Ituango, told
Radionet radio that the number of dead could be much higher.
</P>
<P>
   In a communique, The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the
country's largest rebel group, said its fighters had killed at
least 32 militia members as well as destroyed a cocaine processing
laboratory run by the rightists.
</P>
<P>
   The mountainside clashes were reported 200 miles from the
capital, Bogota. The area is a stronghold of the landowner-backed
paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's rebels and paramilitary armies have fought for
control of the territory where peasants and drug traffickers grow
coca, the plant used to make cocaine. Both groups make huge profits
by taxing the crop.

<HEADLINE> Pataki Campaign Aide Denies Scheme  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A campaign aide to Gov. George Pataki repeatedly
denied Thursday that he helped to arrange early release of violent
felons in exchange for political contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Donohue, finance director for a group called Friends of
Pataki, testified as a defense witness in a campaign corruption
trial of Korean-American businessman Yung Soo Yoo.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors allege Yoo brokered deals to guarantee to
three sets of Korean-American parents that campaign contributions
totaling $36,000 would result in parole for their inmate sons.
</P>
<P>
   Outside court, Donohue's lawyer, Tom Puccio, called the
pay-for-parole probe a ''witchhunt'' in which his innocent client
was being used ''to tar Mr. Yoo.''
</P>
<P>
   Donohue has not been charged with any crime, and the governor's
office denies any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   On the stand, Donohue admitted meeting with a pastor whose son,
convicted robber and gang member John Kim, was paroled in 1996
after the family arranged for $7,000 in donations to the Pataki
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue testified he was unaware the donors had a child in
prison and said he returned the money when he learned they thought
there was quid pro quo.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors used internal memos, testimony by the parents and
secretly recorded conversations in an attempt to show that Donohue
illicitly lobbied for the prisoners' release. Donohue said he
contacted administration insiders about the inmates only to help
the families learn more about their legal status.
</P>
<P>
   Three parole officials have been charged or convicted in the
grand jury investigation of alleged influence peddling.
</P>
<P>
   Yoo, 63, of Glen Ridge, N.J., faces up to 10 years in prison if
convicted on corruption and obstruction of justice charges.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue, 29, has continued raising money for Pataki, the
Republican party and Senate hopeful Rick Lazio.

<HEADLINE> Senate Passes Agriculture Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate agreed Thursday to add $900 million
in emergency aid to a farm appropriations measure despite some
complaints that it was excessive, even if the money addressed real
needs.
</P>
<P>
   The package of 15 amendments, approved on a voice vote, would
provide millions of dollars for flood damage and other natural
disasters and losses in livestock, apples, potatoes and citrus
crops, among others.
</P>
<P>
   The $75.3 billion measure financing food and farm programs for
next year already contains more than $1 billion in emergency aid.
It passed the Senate on a 79-13 vote and now must be reconciled
with a House version.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency amendments drew fierce objections from several
Republican fiscal conservatives, who complained that the projected
budget surplus was leading lawmakers to wreck budget spending
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe this has gone too far,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas. ''We are letting this surplus burn a hole in our
pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   It came on top of a $15 billion farm bailout bill passed in May
that ws aimed at beefing up crop insurance programs and made $5.5
billion in direct cash payments to growers suffering low commodity
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Several senators said it was Congress' responsibility to respond
to emergencies ''when people are flat on their backs for causes
they cannot control,'' in the words of Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm and his allies won a commitment from the bill's sponsors
that no more emergency spending would be added, but that could
easily be changed.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, the Senate narrowly rejected a measure aimed
at trying to resolve a dispute with a Texas beef processor over
government meat safety standards.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment offered to the agriculture spending bill by Sen.
Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, was aimed at a dispute involving the Department
of Agriculture and Supreme Beef Processors Inc., which supplies
ground beef to the national school lunch program.
</P>
<P>
   The department tried to close the facility last month after it
failed its fourth straight set of microbial tests, but a federal
judge in Texas barred the agency from using such test results to
force the closing of the facility. The judge agreed with the
meatpacking industry that testing for salmonella bacteria was not a
fair measure of whether a plant was sanitary.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin's amendment would have given the department the legal
authority to withdraw or suspend inspection from meat and poultry
plants that fail to reduce pathogens in their products. It failed
by a vote of 48-49.
</P>
<P>
   ''If USDA lacks the authority to enforce pathogen reduction
standards than surely we stand at the edge of a food safety
debacle,'' Harkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents wanted further study.
</P>
<P>
   ''This amendment, if we adopt it here, would impose a legal, a
new legal authority that's not now present,'' said Sen. Thad
Cochran, R-Miss. and the chairman of the Senate agriculture
appropriations subcommittee. ''That would give the Department of
Agriculture more power than it has. . . and more power than we
ought to on an appropriations bill without further review.''
</P>
<P>
   The House last month approved its $75.4 billion version of
agriculture spending. Once the Senate agrees to its bill, both
sides will have to work out any differences.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also faces a veto threat. The Clinton administration
has voiced concern about the current spending levels of food safety
and environmental issues in the congressional bills.
</P>
<P>
   A major difference in the House and Senate versions is a
provision in the Senate bill that would allow food and medicine
sales to Cuba. The House rejected the provision earlier but has
agreed to add a more restricted version in conference.

<HEADLINE> Denver Mayor Seeks Intervention  </HEADLINE>
By COLLEEN SLEVIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- The city's mayor on Thursday asked the U.S.
transportation secretary to help solve labor problems at United
Airlines that have delayed and stranded passengers at Denver
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Weather was partly responsible for the delays, but Mayor
Wellington Webb also blamed labor negotiations with pilots and
mechanics and alleged slowdowns by air traffic controllers at
Chicago's O'Hare airport.
</P>
<P>
   Webb, who sent a letter to Transportation Secretary Rodney
Slater Thursday, did not side with labor or United.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know whose fault it is that we're not flying,'' said
Webb, whose own recent flight on United was delayed by 4&AMP;frac12; hours.
</P>
<P>
   United spokesman Joe Hopkins said federal mediators are already
involved in the negotiations with pilots.
</P>
<P>
   He would not comment on what else Slater could do to help
negotiations with mechanics. Neither side has requested mediation
in those talks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation Department spokeswoman Mary Trupo said the agency
normally does not get involved in labor issues but is watching
United closely.
</P>
<P>
   Trupo said the problems in Chicago, which she blamed on
''renegade'' controllers, are still under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''That little episode, I don't think we'll be seeing that
replayed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, hundreds of flights were canceled or delayed for
hours at O'Hare. The Chicago Tribune reported that a local work
slowdown by air traffic controllers, unrelated to the United
negotiations, was to blame. A union official denied that.
</P>
<P>
   United's parent company acknowledged this week an ''abnormally
high rate of delays and cancellations'' in announcing a drop in
second-quarter earnings from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   United spokesman Chris Braithwaite said about 100 flights were
canceled Thursday out of 2,400 domestic flights nationwide. In
Denver, seven out of 317 scheduled departures were canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Maintenance-related flight cancellations more than doubled
nationwide after the mechanics' contract expired July 12, a United
vice president said in a letter circulated within the company.
</P>
<P>
   The official blamed the cancellations on mechanics' refusing to
work overtime and writing more reports on potential aircraft
problems.

<HEADLINE> House Against Easing Cuba Barriers  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Thursday against easing broad
trade restrictions against Cuba. But supporters of increased
contacts with the communist nation continued pressing for a lifting
of restrictions against food and medicine sales and travel there by
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   By 241-174, the House rejected a proposal by Rep. Charles
Rangel, D-N.Y., that would have ended enforcement of the United
States' prohibitions against trading with the Caribbean island
nation.
</P>
<P>
   But an alliance of conservative, liberal, business- and
farm-state lawmakers, arguing that increased contacts would help
weaken Fidel Castro's rule, were forcing two additional votes that
were more narrowly focused. One would halt enforcement of travel
restrictions, the other of restrictions against U.S. sales there of
food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals were the latest congressional battle this year
over removing some of the four-decade-old trade barriers between
the United States and the Caribbean island nation.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, farm-state lawmakers led by Rep. George
Nethercutt, R-Wash., tried to lift the food and medicine embargo
against Cuba but ran into opposition by Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides agreed to a compromise last month that House GOP
leaders have promised to try pushing into law. Supporters said that
if the House voted on Thursday to ease the restrictions, it would
strengthen Nethercutt's hand in getting his compromise enacted.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Castro legislators said allowing Cuba to receive more U.S.
trade and tourists would help prop up his regime.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., said the revenue Cuba would
gain from easing the restrictions would help ''the worst violator
of human rights in all of the Western Hemisphere.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Where's your compassion'' for the Cubans and Americans Castro
has killed? asked House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, who was a
chief opponent to Nethercutt's effort earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   But sponsors of easing the trade and travel embargoes said the
result would be to accelerate the drive toward freedom in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan ''allowed Americans with backpacks to travel in
Eastern Europe, and it did help bring down the Berlin Wall,'' said
conservative Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., chief sponsor of the
language easing the travel restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Personal freedom follows economic freedom,'' said Rep. Jerry
Moran, R-Kan., who conceded that lifting the food embargo would
help his farm-state constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of medicine to Cuba have been allowed since 1992 with
certain restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of an easing of travel restrictions last year by the
Clinton administration for students, athletes, artists and others,
the government says about 82,000 Americans flew to Cuba last year.
That was a 47 percent over the 55,900 who did so in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement last month between House GOP leaders and
Nethercutt, Americans could sell food and drugs to Cuba -- but only
if the Cubans paid for them with cash or with credit from a third
country.
</P>
<P>
   The prohibition against financing by the U.S. government or U.S.
banks was seen by many critics, including some farm-state
lawmakers, as meaning that little trade would actually occur as a
result of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   That agreement would also write into law an existing ban on U.S.
tourist travel to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., has said he opposes
the compromise, but President Clinton has said he would probably
sign it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration decided a year ago to allow sales of food
and medicine to Iran, Libya and Sudan but was barred by law from
easing the embargo on Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The provisions the House debated Thursday were offered as
amendments to a measure financing the Treasury Department and other
smaller agencies in the coming fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate version of the bill has no language affecting trade
with Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Valderrama Top-Vote Getter for MLS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Tampa Bay midfielder Carlos Valderrama, Los
Angeles midfielder Mauricio Cienfuegos and Galaxy forward Cobi
Jones became five-time MLS All-Stars when they were elected
Thursday to start in the July 29 game in Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Valderrama, a former star for Colombia's national team and Major
League Soccer's assists leader with 19, received the most votes,
57,319.
</P>
<P>
   German star Lothar Matthaeus, who played poorly for the New
York/New Jersey MetroStars before leaving for the European
Championship and has appeared in only one MLS game since, was
elected to start at defender for the East.
</P>
<P>
   Jones and Chicago's Ante Razov, who scored the U.S. goal in
Sunday's World Cup qualifier at Guatemala, were elected to start at
forward for the West, with Cienfuegos joined in the midfield by
Chicago's Chris Armas and Peter Nowak, Kansas City's Preki
Radosavljevic and San Jose's Khodadad Azizi.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Fraser and Greg Vanney of Los Angeles and Marcelo Balboa
of Colorado were elected to start at defender, and Kansas City's
Tony Meola -- the U.S. starter in the 1990 and 1994 World Cups, was
elected at goalkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Adolfo Valencia of the MetroStars, another former Colombia
national team star, was elected to start at forward for the East
along with D.C. United's Jaime Moreno, a starter for Bolivia's
national team.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Valderrama and United's Marco Etcheverry -- another
Bolivian starter -- at midfield were the MetroStars' Clint Mathis
and Mark Chung, and Tampa Bay's Steve Ralston.
</P>
<P>
   Matthaeus is joined at defender by DC United's Eddie Pope and
Jeff Agoos, both starters for the U.S. national team.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Ammann of the MetroStars was elected at goalkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Agoos, Etcheverry and Radosavljevic also were elected to their
fifth MLS All-Star games.
</P>
<P>
   Seven starters will be making their first All-Star appearance:
Ammann, Azizi, Mathis, Matthaeus, Razov, Valencia and Vanney.

<HEADLINE> Braves and Marlins Split Games  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Tom Glavine won at Miami for the first time in five
years and even managed to retire nemesis Mike Redmond once.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Braves left-hander pitched 6 1-3 innings, overcoming
three errors by teammates Thursday to help beat the Florida Marlins
5-3 in the first game of a doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Floyd broke a seventh-inning tie with a pinch-hit, two-run
homer and A.J. Burnett pitched seven innings to win his 2000 debut
as Florida beat Atlanta 6-1 in the nightcap.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine (11-5) improved to 3-8 in Miami, where he had lost five
consecutive games since beating Florida on May 3, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been awhile,'' he said. ''You try to approach every game
like it's the first time you've gone out there, and don't worry
about what has happened in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Redmond had two hits and an RBI against Glavine and improved his
career average against the lefty to .722 (13-for-18). But with two
on and Glavine clinging to a 4-3 lead, Redmond ended the sixth with
a flyout.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got him out when I had to,'' Glavine said. ''I've thrown him
bad pitches and he's hit them. I've thrown good pitches and he's
hit them. He has certainly gotten the best of me, but I got him out
in a big situation.''
</P>
<P>
   There were perhaps a thousand fans in the stands at the start of
the doubleheader, which was necessary because Wednesday's game was
rained out in the fifth inning. Attendance eventually swelled to
28,978, the largest Thursday crowd at Miami since the Marlins' 1997
World Series championship season.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest cheer of the night came when Derrek Lee greeted John
Rocker with a homer in the eighth inning of the second game. The
homer was Lee's 20th.
</P>
<P>
   In the opener, Florida's Ryan Dempster (9-7) allowed only six
hits in seven innings, but four were for extra bases, including
Reggie Sanders' fifth homer leading off the third. Dempster has
lost his past three starts.
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive day, fans booed Atlanta manager Bobby
Cox, who picked Dempster for the National League All-Star team but
didn't use him. Dempster said he has no complaint with Cox, but
he's already looking forward to facing the Braves next week in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the same game in five days against the same pitcher,''
Dempster said. ''They got me today. Hopefully I'll get them next
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine won his fourth consecutive start, allowing nine hits and
three runs, two unearned. He improved his career record to 198-121.
</P>
<P>
   A two-run homer by Floyd broke a 1-1 tie in the seventh inning
of the nightcap. A fan in the first row in right field deflected
the ball back onto the field, but it was unclear from replays
whether he reached over the wall, and Cox discussed the ruling with
home-plate umpire Jeff Kellogg only briefly.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Smith's two-run double later in the inning against Scott
Kamieniecki (1-1) made the score 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett (1-0) allowed one run and three hits in seven innings.
He arrived at the stadium two hours before the game from Triple-A
Calgary, where he was on a rehabilitation assignment after
recovering from a thumb injury sustained in spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Wally Joyner's RBI single gave Atlanta a 1-0 lead in the first
inning. Kevin Millar tied the score in the fourth with his 10th
homer.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Kevin Millwood allowed only one run in six innings but
remained winless since June 20.
</P>
<P>
   Three doubles helped Atlanta score three times in the sixth to
take a 4-3 lead in the opener. Andruw Jones and Chipper Jones
doubled for one run. Brian Jordan walked, Javy Lopez hit an RBI
double, and another run came home when pinch hitter Joyner grounded
into a forceout.
</P>
<P>
   Former Marlin Bobby Bonilla received a big ovation when he
pinch-hit in the ninth. He then delivered a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Ligtenberg pitched the ninth for his eighth save in 10
chances.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Florida RHP Alex Fernandez underwent arthroscopic surgery
Thursday to tighten a recurrent loose right shoulder capsule was
tightened. He'll miss the rest of the season. ... Atlanta SS Walt
Weiss left the first game in the sixth inning with a strained right
knee. His status is day to day. ... Because of Wednesday's rainout,
the Braves moved their starters up a day. In this weekend's series
against Houston, Atlanta will start Terry Mulholland on Friday,
Greg Maddux on Saturday and Alan Ashby on Sunday. ... Marlins RHP
Brad Penny, who went on the disabled list Wednesday, was diagnosed
with a slight internal impingement of the right shoulder. The
injury will be treated with exercise and anti-inflammatory
medicine. He's expected to resume throwing in 10 days and rejoin
the rotation in two weeks. ... The weather was 91 and sunny at the
start of the doubleheader. It was the first this year for both
teams. ... Glavine has allowed just one homer by a left-hander this
year. ... C Redmond hasn't made an error this season. ... Florida's
Luis Castillo extended his hitting streak to 12 games.

<HEADLINE> NYC Wary of West Nile Virus  </HEADLINE>
By JUDIE GLAVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Tests have shown that a man who died after
reporting symptoms similar to those of the West Nile virus did not
have the disease, but the city remained vigilant for signs of the
potentially deadly illness.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of the mosquito-borne virus, which killed seven people in
the New York area last summer, was causing subtle changes in life
in Staten Island, the only city borough where the disease has shown
up this year. Two dead crows were found to have carried the virus.
</P>
<P>
   At the Friends day care center Thursday, the ball pit was empty
and the wavy, red slide was abandoned by the toddlers whose giggles
can usually be heard. Workers at the wooded Clay Pit Ponds State
Park Preserve armed themselves with cans of bug repellent.
</P>
<P>
   Adriana Robotti told her three daughters to stay out of their
pool because the city had sprayed the insecticide Anvil in the area
to kill mosquitoes. She was not only concerned about the pesticide,
but also mosquito bites.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel a little like a mosquito myself -- trapped,'' Robotti
said Thursday. ''I can't lock the kids in the house the rest of the
summer. It's crazy and more than a little scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerns were heightened after a 71-year-old man visiting from
South Carolina died Wednesday on Staten Island after being
hospitalized with West Nile-like symptoms: muscle aches, stiff neck
and flu-like ailments.
</P>
<P>
   But Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Thursday that tests for West
Nile came back negative.
</P>
<P>
   West Nile can result in encephalitis, or a swelling of the
brain. The elderly and those with weak immune systems are most at
risk.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta has recommended mosquito control, including aerial
spraying, in a two-mile radius of infected birds and mosquitos to
help avoid transmission of the virus to people.
</P>
<P>
   More than two dozen dead, infected birds have been found in
parts of two suburban counties, Westchester and Rockland;
virus-carrying mosquitoes were found in Suffolk County, on Long
Island. All three counties have plans to spray.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups and activists are suing the city in an
attempt to stop the spraying, claiming the insecticide is harmful
to humans, fish and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   ''We find that these insecticides they are spraying are far
worse than any kind of ailment in the city,'' Mitchell Cohen, a
member of the No Spray Coalition Against the Misuse of Pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   Lori Daidone, the co-owner of the Friends preschool and day care
center, was taking all precautions against bugs and the spray. She
kept the dozen preschoolers in her care inside Thursday instead of
playing in the yard.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hate keeping them inside on such a beautiful summer day,''
she said, ''but I'm not taking any chances.''

<HEADLINE> House Votes To Lift Cuban Limits  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Thursday to lift limits
against U.S. food and drug sales to Cuba and against Americans
seeking to travel there in a major victory for farm, business and
other groups trying to ease the four-decade-old restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   With supporters arguing that increased contacts would help
weaken Fidel Castro's hold over the communist nation, the House
voted 232-186 to stop enforcing rules that limit the ability of
Americans to travel to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   It then voted 301-116 to also halt enforcement of rules banning
U.S. exports there of food, and of rules limiting sales there of
American medicine.

<HEADLINE> Ottey Wins Heats at Olympic Trials  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) -- Merlene Ottey, at age 40 trying to
qualify for her sixth Olympic team, advanced to the semifinals of
100 meters Thursday at Jamaica's Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
   She won her heat in 11.09 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Monaco-based Ottey's second race -- and first in
Jamaica -- since being cleared of drug use by an International
Amateur Athletics Federation panel on July 10. Track and field's
world governing body reinstated her after a year's ban, concluding
that a Swiss laboratory had improperly tested her urine sample when
she came up positive for the steroid nandrolone at a meet in
Switzerland in July 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Ottey, who has kept a low profile since arriving in Jamaica five
days ago, had a slow start but made up ground on runner-up Tanya
Lawrence then eased up at the line for the win.
</P>
<P>
   ''With 30 meters to go I was in a daze, but I got going and it
was easy after that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She needs to finish in the top three of Friday's 100 final to
qualify for the event at the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Jamaica Amateur Athletics Association, who long
ago cleared Ottey of the drug charges, have said the double silver
medalist at the 1996 Games would likely be included on their
Olympic squad even if she fails to place among the top three
finishers or post the required time of 11.40.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, at a regional meet in Sardinia, Italy, Ottey won the
100 in a slow 11.42.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Carlos Delgado homered twice to tie Gary
Sheffield for the major league lead at 32, and Tony Batista hit a
go-ahead home run Thursday night as the Toronto Blue Jays beat the
Tampa Bay Devil Rays 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado homered off a Hard Rock Cafe restaurant window in right
field in the second inning and added an opposite-field shot off
Steve Trachsel in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Batista's 28th homer, a solo drive off Rick White (4-5) in the
eighth, broke a 5-all tie.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay dropped to 2-15 in Canada, including 2-13 at Toronto.
The Blue Jays have homered in 19 straight home games, two short of
the team record,
</P>
<P>
   All-Star starter David Wells, winless since July 8 after winning
five straight starts, again failed to get victory No. 16. He gave
up five runs, including four in the fifth, and seven hits in 4 1-3
innings, raising his ERA from 3.66 to 3.87.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Quantrill (1-5) pitched a scoreless eighth for his first
win since last Oct. 1 at Cleveland and Billy Koch finished for his
23rd save in his 27 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto trailed 5-3 in the seventh but tied the score on Shannon
Stewart's run-scoring grounder and Craig Grebeck's RBI single off
reliever Jim Mecir.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado's 459-foot shot off the Hard Rock gave Toronto a 1-0
lead in the second. Jose Cruz added an RBI single in the second.
</P>
<P>
   After Gerald Williams hit a solo homer in the third, Delgado's
homer in the fourth made it 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Wells loaded the bases in the fifth by hitting Felix Martinez
with a pitch, and allowing singles to Gerald Williams and Russ
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   He then walked Greg Vaughn on four pitches -- just Wells' 21st
walk in 139 2-3 inning. Fred McGriff followed with a two-run single
for a 4-3 Tampa Bay lead, and Jose Canseco's single chased Wells.
</P>
<P>
   John Frascatore hit Vinny Castilla on the right wrist with a
pitch, forcing in another run and sending the third baseman to a
hospital for X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto had runners at first and third in the fifth, but third
baseman Ozzie Guillen made a diving stop, and threw to first to
throw out Shannon Stewart. Guillen replaced Castilla a half inning
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Delgado has four two-homer games this season and 19 in his
career. He has 21 multihomer games. ... Delgado is the first
Toronto player to hit 30 or more homers in four straight years.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Park Evacuated Over Fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA VERDE NATIONAL PARK, Colo. (AP) -- Authorities closed Mesa
Verde National Park and ordered 1,000 day campers and visitors to
leave Thursday after a wildfire raced through tinder-dry brush,
growing from 50 acres to 500 acres in about three hours.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries were reported and the park's Pueblo Indian ruins
were not damaged, said fire management officer Mark Lauer. One
structure, believed to be a residence, was threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Park officials feared the fire might cross the park's only road
and trap visitors, but it had not done so by Thursday evening. Some
visitors at a lodge about 10 miles from the fire and employees who
live in the park were allowed to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Erratic winds caused by thunderstorms and high temperatures
hampered the 300 firefighters who battled flames in steep, rugged
terrain and rolling plateaus.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa Verde, about 35 miles west of Durango in southwestern
Colorado, is laden with cliff dwellings of the ancestral Pueblos.
It was established by Congress on June 29, 1906, as the first
cultural park set aside in the National Park system.
</P>
<P>
   An August 1996 fire scorched a tenth of the park and revealed
more than 400 previously unknown archaeological sites that had been
covered by dense forest. Those sites remain off-limits to the
public in the park's backcountry area.
</P>
<P>
   Officials suspect lightning started Thursday's fire.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been 89 to 90 all day and all week,'' Lauer said. ''It's
been hot and dry with very little precipitation since April.''
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters also worked Thursday to protect livestock and a
home from a wildfire on 950 acres in national forest and private
land northwest of Meeker, about 150 miles northwest of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Six other fires that were less than 100 acres each were burning
across Colorado.

<HEADLINE> Movie and music companies sue Internet company  </HEADLINE>
By GARY GENTILE
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) - A group of movie studios and record companies
filed a lawsuit Thursday against Scour Inc., a company that, like
Napster, helps people exchange music and video files over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The music and record companies allege Scour facilitates the
''global piracy of copyrighted motion pictures and sound
recordings.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the movies the suit claims can be downloaded from Scour
are ''Gladiator,'' ''Mission: Impossible 2'' and ''The X-Men'' -
movies not yet available on video or DVD.
</P>
<P>
   ''This lawsuit is about stealing,'' said Jack Valenti, president
of the Motion Picture Association of America, which filed the suit
on behalf of the movie studios. ''It's a harsh word to use, but the
only word that fits the definition of what is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Scour President Dan Rodrigues said he was surprised by the
lawsuit. ''Since our launch, all Scour services have complied with
all applicable laws,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodrigues said Scour executives met Thursday with Utah Sen.
Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to discuss
recent congressional hearings into online music and Scour's efforts
to work with major entertainment companies.
</P>
<P>
   The MPAA and the Recording Industry Association of America,
which recently sued Napster, have been aggressive in enforcing
copyright claims. A trial is under way in New York in a suit filed
by the MPAA against a Web site that allegedly makes available
software to descramble the code meant to prevent DVDs from being
copied.
</P>
<P>
   The RIAA also is party to the suit against Scour. The lawsuit
eeks an injunction against Scour. Attorneys representing the MPAA
said copyright law allows for $150,000 in damages for every movie
or recording whose copyright was violated.
</P>
<P>
   Scour has attracted high-profile investors, including Michael
Ovitz, a former agent and president of the Walt Disney Co. who also

comment as a matter of policy on lawsuits involving third parties.

<HEADLINE> National Guard Bomb Suspect Charged  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW TILGHMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- A former National Guardsman was charged
Thursday with breaking into an Air National Guard base with two
pipe bombs in a shopping bag and scrawling ''Free Kosova'' on a
satellite dish.
</P>
<P>
   Milan S. Mititch, 35, appeared briefly in federal court on
charges of federal explosives violations and was ordered held until
a hearing Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyer Nick Kostich said Mititch will plead innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities acting on a tip from a hot line arrested the airline
pilot at his Milwaukee home earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   During Wednesday's incident, the intruder fled and dropped the
bag of explosives as security guards chased after him. The bombs
did not detonate.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has said it does not know of a motive.
</P>
<P>
   Police records show Mititch was arrested in 1998 for allegedly
spray-painting ''U.S.A.=Satan'' on a Milwaukee shoe store after
watching President Clinton on television. The charges were later
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Mititch, a pilot for American Eagle, a regional carrier for
American Airlines, was a member of the Wisconsin Army National
Guard from 1988 until he resigned Nov. 1, said Lt. Col. Tim
Donovan, a guard spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   He is a former chief warrant officer who flew UH60 Blackhawk
helicopters for a unit that was not assigned to Kosovo and did not
participate in the Gulf War, Donovan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't characterize his service,'' Donovan said.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Craig L. Schuetz, director of aviation and safety for the
Wisconsin Army National Guard, served as commander of Mititch's
former aviation battalion until 1996. He said Mititch was
considered a good pilot and was never disciplined for any reason
under his command.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard it on the radio on the way home, and I said, 'You've
got to be kidding me,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI said the intruder scrawled graffiti reading ''Free
Kosova'' on a satellite dish early Wednesday at the 128th Air
Refueling Wing compound. Kosova is an Albanian spelling of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how the intruder got in. The suspect had no
credentials that would have allowed him to get past the gate, FBI
agent David J. Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   During the NATO air strikes in Yugoslavia in 1999, aimed at
ending ethnic repression by Serb forces against ethnic Albanians,
the 128th Air Refueling Wing sent about 170 members to a base
outside London, where they serviced aircraft flying in NATO's air
operations in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Mititch, a U.S. citizen of Serbian descent, was concerned about
the NATO bombings, but no more so than other Serbs, said his
mother, Jacqueline Mititch, 73.
</P>
<P>
   ''All Serbians were upset'' by the NATO bombing campaign and
occupation of the Yugoslavian province, she said. ''He is accused
unjustly. He's a very generous person. I am extremely shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   After Mititch's arrest for allegedly scrawling graffiti in 1998,
he told police he had been drinking at a bar, where he watched a
program about the president on TV. The show bothered him, Mititch
told police.
</P>
<P>
   Mititch told police that the incident was a joke, and that he
did not have ties to foreign governments and did not intend any
further actions, according to police records.
</P>
<P>
   After the incident at the National Guard base, investigators
contacted local Serbian and Albanian communities and went door to
door in some neighborhoods with a composite sketch of the intruder,
Williams said. The sketch was broadcast on Milwaukee TV stations.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Jim Waters, chief of staff at the base, defended its
security: ''Our security forces did their job and prevented
something from happening that was much worse.''

<HEADLINE> Order Banning Radio Station Upheld  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTINE HANLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A radio pirate has no grounds to challenge
the order to shut down his low-power station because he did not
apply for a license or waiver through the Federal Communications
Commission, a federal appeals court ruled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Dunifer, who operated ''Radio Free Berkeley,'' said he
will continue his crusade against broadcast conglomerates that
drown out the real voices of American citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Dunifer and other activists are asking supporters to set up
low-power stations to begin broadcasting at the same time in a mass
protest on the airwaves. He wants the protest to coincide with the
Sept. 20 opening of a National Associated of Broadcasters meeting
in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ''The NAB is our major nemesis. They're the ones trying to stop
the American public from the right to free speech,'' Dunifer said,
referring to a bill before Congress that seeks to roll back the
FCC's nascent program for low-power stations.
</P>
<P>
   John Winston, assistant chief of the FCC's enforcement bureau,
said the agency is pleased that the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in
San Francisco affirmed its power to license broadcasters. The FCC
says some of the pirate stations it has shut down interfered with
licensed broadcasters and air traffic control systems.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the FCC -- in part responding to the pirate radio
movement -- proposed starting a new, local radio service for
churches, students and community groups. It would create thousands
of licensed low-tech FM radio stations from 1 watt to 1,000 watts
after a 20-year ban against such licenses.
</P>
<P>
   The NAB and key congressional Republicans fear such entities
would create interference to FM radio stations.

<HEADLINE> Royals 10, Indians 6  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Jeff Suppan pitched 7 1-3 innings for his first
road win this season as six Royals drove in runs Thursday night in
Kansas City's 10-6 win over the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Suppan (4-6), making his 12th start away from Kauffman Stadium,
allowed four runs and nine hits in getting his second straight
victory, just his second since May 24.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Damon had four hits and two RBIs for the Royals, who used
a five-run third off rookie Jim Brower (2-3) and 15 singles to
sweep the two-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Ramirez, perhaps playing his final home game, homered
twice and drove in three runs for the Indians. Ricky Ledee had a
two-run homer in the ninth for Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez is eligible to become a free agent after this season,
but could be gone long before that if Cleveland decides to deal him
before the July 31 trade deadline. There might have been a few
Indians packing their travel bags for good as the Indians left on
an 11-game, 14-day road trip that ends Aug. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez has a pair of two-homer games this week, and since
returning from the disabled list is 12-for-29 (.414) with five
homers and 12 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland played without All-Star second baseman Roberto Alomar,
expected to miss 3-to-5 days with a sore left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez's second homer, his 18th, was a two-run shot in the
sixth that pulled the Indians to 8-4. Travis Fryman followed with a
double and with none out it looked like the Indians would finally
get to Suppan.
</P>
<P>
   But the right-hander struck out the side and pitched a perfect
seventh. He was replaced after walking Ramirez with one out in the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals scored five runs on five hits in the third to chase
Brower, who remained winless since June 20 -- a span of six starts.
</P>
<P>
   After a leadoff walk to Greg Zaun, Carlos Febles singled and
Johnny Damon followed with a single to load the bases. Rey
Sanchez's base hit tied it 1-1, and Brower walked Sweeney with the
bases loaded to force in the Royals' second run.
</P>
<P>
   Dye's run-scoring single made it 3-1 and left the bases loaded,
and one out later, Mark Quinn squibbed a broken-bat RBI grounder
through the middle as the Royals opened a 4-1 lead. Todd Dunwoody's
sacrifice fly to center capped the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thome's RBI single in the first inning gave the Indians a
1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Indians set a club record by using their 27th pitcher
this season when Cameron Cairncross made his major league debut in
the ninth. ... Kansas City has scored five runs or more in each of
its last 11 wins. ... For the second straight game, the grounds
crew relined the batter's and catcher's boxes around home plate at
crew chief Gerry Davis' request. Normally, the inside lines are not
chalked at Jacobs Field but the commissioner's office reminded all
umpires last week to apply the rule uniformly to all teams. ...
Ramirez's 216th career homers moved him into a tie for fourth place
on Cleveland's career list with Hal Trosky. His 741 RBIs pushed him
into 10th place on the club's career list, one ahead of Lou
Boudreau. ... Suppan has given up an AL-leading 27 homers.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Coup Leader Threatens Olympics  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Fiji nationalist coup leader George Speight
called Friday for people throughout the South Pacific to join his
''crusade'' for indigenous rights and threatened to join forces
with Australia's Aborigines to disrupt the Sydney Olympics in
September.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am going to make a call to all ethnic people in the South
Pacific to stand up and exert their rights,'' Speight said.
</P>
<P>
   Aborigines have already said they will stage peaceful protests
at the games but there has been no indication other South Pacific
peoples will join them.
</P>
<P>
   Speight, a failed businessman, threw Fiji into crisis May 19,
when he led an armed gang into Parliament and took dozens of
lawmakers hostage, including Mahendra Chaudhry, the first ethnic
Indian elected prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Speight's coup was carried out in the name of guaranteeing
political superiority to indigenous Fijians.
</P>
<P>
   The military took power 10 days after the coup.
</P>
<P>
   The demise of democracy in Fiji, a nation of 320 islands about
2,250 miles northeast of Sydney, prompted Australia, New Zealand
and now the United States to impose sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The American sanctions involve suspension of defense aid and
cooperation with Fiji worth an estimated $1 million.

House Votes To Lift Cuban Limits
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Thursday to lift limits against U.S. food
and drug sales to Cuba and against Americans seeking to travel there in a major
victory for farm, business and other groups trying to ease the four-decade-old
restrictions. With supporters arguing that increased contacts would help weaken
Fidel Castro's hold over the communist nation, the House voted 232-186 to stop
enforcing rules that limit the ability of Americans to travel to Cuba. It then
voted 301-116 to also halt enforcement of rules banning U.S. exports there of
food, and of rules limiting sales there of American medicine.

   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Vanquished primary rival John McCain has told a
prominent Republican governor and mutual friend of George W. Bush that he would
be willing to serve as the Texan's running mate, sources said today. McCain, who
has previously ruled out a vice presidential bid, signaled his change of heart
in a telephone conversation this week with Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, amid a
series of developments abruptly raising McCain's profile as Bush draws close to
deciding, three GOP officials said. Ridge has been considered a top candidate
for the job, but told McCain that he didn't think he was still in the running,

   ITOMAN, Okinawa, Japan (AP) -- Pivoting from the Mideast peace summit,
President Clinton stopped Friday on the hallowed ground of the last major land
battle of World War II and sought to soothe long-simmering tensions over the
huge American military presence on Okinawa. ''We take seriously our
responsibility to be good neighbors, and it is unacceptable to the United States
when we do not meet that responsibility,'' Clinton said in prepared remarks. He
pledged to complete a process of consolidating U.S. bases on Okinawa and ''to
reduce our footprint on this island.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House debated today whether to allow unrestricted

proposals, pushed by an alliance of conservative, liberal, business- and
farm-state lawmakers, were the latest congressional battle this year over
removing some of the four-decade-old trade barriers between the United States

stepping in for the traveling President Clinton. ''She will try to close the
gaps'' that loom large between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, her spokesman said. With the summit in its 10th day,
wearniess loomed as a factor. Shortly after the White House announced late last

course and decided to stay at Camp David, Md., while Clinton attended a

<HEADLINE> Publicist sues Christina Aguilera's mother, others, over star's career </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A New York publicist has filed a $7 million
lawsuit charging that the mother of teen singer Christina Aguilera
and others have cheated her out of her share of the young star's
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Inniss says in papers filed Wednesday in Manhattan's State
Supreme Court that she is owed at least $2 million from the
singer's earnings from her debut album, ''Christina Aguilera,'' and
from other activities.
</P>
<P>
   The album, which reached No. 1 on pop sales charts, produced at
least two hit singles, ''Genie in a Bottle,'' and ''What a Girl
Wants.'' Aguilera, 19, also sang ''Reflection'' in the Disney movie
''Mulan'' in 1998, and won a Grammy for ''best new artist'' of
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Inniss says in court papers that she saw Aguilera's potential in
1993 while in Orlando, Fla., doing publicity for the female R&AMP;B
singing group, SWV. Christina was 12 and a Mouseketeer on the
Mickey Mouse Show.
</P>
<P>
   Inniss' court papers say she told Aguilera's mother, Shelly
Kearns, that she could help the girl's singing career and they
agreed to stay in touch.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1994, Inniss' papers say, Kearns contacted her. The
women agreed that Inniss would act as Aguilera's manager, helping
to develop all phases of her career, and receive a standard
manager's commission.
</P>
<P>
   Inniss' papers say the music industry lawyer she approached to
help with Aguilera's career cut her out of the girl's career,
despite Inniss' tireless and continuous efforts on the teen-ager's
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Inniss accused the lawyer, Normand R. Kurtz, head of Dartmouth
Management Co. and Dartmouth Record Co., and his son Steven Kurtz,
head of Marquee Management Co., of interfering with her contract
with Kearns.
</P>
<P>
   Court papers seek $2 million of Aguilera's earnings and $5
million in compensatory and punitive damages from the Kurtzes and
their companies. The lawsuit accuses Kearns of breach of contract.
</P>
<P>
   Inniss' lawyer, Michael Steindam, said his client does not have
a written contract with any of the defendants. But he says RCA,
Aguilera's recording company, produced a promotional videotape in
which Kearns refers to Inniss - though not by name - in discussing
how her daughter was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Kurtz said, ''I've never had any dealings with Ruth Inniss
regarding Christina Aguilera - ever.'' He said he had no further
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Normand Kurtz did not return telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Kearns could not be reached for comment.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox, Orioles Split Doubleheader  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Mark Lewis doubled in three runs in a four-run
third inning and Will Clark and Mike Bordick homered as the
Baltimore Orioles beat Boston 9-4 Thursday for a split of a
day-night doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
   Boston won the first game 11-7 behind a 17-hit attack that
included homers by Carl Everett and Jason Varitek. Everett's home
run came in his first at-bat since learning that he had received a
10-game suspension and a fine for twice bumping an umpire.
</P>
<P>
   The players' association immediately appealed the suspension,
meaning Everett can continue playing until a hearing is held.
</P>
<P>
   Troy O'Leary went 4-for-4 with a walk and three RBIs in the
opener as the Red Sox overcame a grand slam by Clark to win their
fifth straight.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra went 3-for-5 in the first game to raise his
batting average to .403, but an 0-for-5 performance in the nightcap
dropped him to .396.
</P>
<P>
   In the nightcap, Scott Hatteberg homered to give Boston a 3-2
lead in the second inning. Lewis doubled with the bases loaded in
the third and scored on a sacrifice fly by Luis Matos to put the
Orioles ahead to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Clark led off the fourth with his eighth homer to make it 7-3,
and a two-run drive by Bordick put Baltimore up 9-4 in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Erickson (5-7) allowed one run, three hits and six walks
in 5 1-3 innings for his second win in seven starts since June 10.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Schourek (2-9) gave up five runs, five hits and five walks
in 2 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Everett received the suspension and a fine for bumping umpire
Ronald Kulpa in Saturday's game against the New York Mets. But the
appeal gave him a chance to play, and he didn't waste any time
taking advantage of the reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   Everett hit his career-high 26th homer off Sidney Ponson (5-6)
to stake the Red Sox to a 2-0 first-inning lead in the opener. He
also struck out four times.
</P>
<P>
   Everett went 0-for-3 with a strikeout and two walks in the
nightcap.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox probably have enough offense to cover for Everett's
absence if he is ultimately suspended.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't look at like that. You don't look for people to pick
it up after something goes awry,'' Boston manager Jimy Williams
said. ''You look for them to be themselves. You do not change how
you play.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Martinez (8-5) gave up five runs and six hits in five
innings to win a second straight game for the first time since May
5-10.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The first game was a makeup of a rainout one night earlier.
... Albert Belle, who stole 17 bases for Baltimore last season, has
yet to record a steal this year. ... Brady Anderson stole his 10th
base in the nightcap, giving him double figures in each of his 13
big-league seasons. ... Veteran umpires John Hirschbeck and Tim
Welke worked the second game in Orioles' caps after coming over
from contract meetings in Baltimore without their equipment. They
replaced Kerwin Danley, who injured his knee, and Ian Lamplugh, who
had a day game to work Friday.

<HEADLINE> Nature Conservancy expands St. John River protection  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ORONO, Maine (AP) - The Nature Conservancy has struck land deals
with northern Maine landowners to protect additional areas along
remote sections of the St. John River.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with J.M. Huber Corp. adds more than two miles of river
protection within a 6,000-acre acquisition, the nonprofit
conservation organization announced Thursday. The transaction
involved the exchange of land and timber rights.
</P>
<P>
   The conservancy swapped its ownership of land that didn't abut
the river for J.M. Huber's ownership of land along the river. The
land the conservancy gave up was not as valuable ecologically or
recreationally as the land along the river, said Kent Wommack,
executive director of the Nature Conservancy's Maine chapter.
</P>
<P>
   J.M. Huber then donated a conservation easement on 36,000 acres
of land in the river's watershed that will ensure that the area
isn't developed, the conservation group said. The company, based in
Edison, N.J., has operations in Easton, Old Town and Millinocket.
</P>
<P>
   The company and its workers want the river ''to be enjoyed by
all who love the wilds of Maine as we do,'' said Gerry Collins,
J.M. Huber's vice president of natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate 7,000-acre deal, the Nature Conservancy also
acquired partial ownership of land over which the upper St. John
River runs for about 17 miles through Dunn Timberlands.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Sawyer, president of Dunn Timberlands, was a member of
the committee that drew up the river's resource protection plan
that has guided timber operations since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   The Dunn agreement involved having the conservancy buy out a
Dunn heir's share of lands for between $1 million and $1.5 million,
which it borrowed from its Land Preservation Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The heir did not want the exact amount made public, Wommack
said. The conservancy also agreed to swap its interest in land that
doesn't abut the river for Dunn's interest in riverside land,
Wommack said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dunn agreement and the J.M. Huber deal expands the
conservation group's ownership interest in lands abutting the river
from 40 to 60 miles, or 40,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   ''The best conservation deals are struck when the parties
respect one another's needs and intentions,'' Wommack said.

   The land deals announced Thursday are the first Nature
Conservancy acquisitions along the river since it bought 185,000
acres from International Paper in 1998. The conservancy borrowed
$35 million from its Land Preservation Fund for the purchase, its
largest financial commitment to any project. It has raised $32
million so far to pay back the loan.

	   EAST HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - An elderly man shot his estranged wife
then turned the gun on himself Thursday night in front of a crowd
that had gathered for a concert on the town's green, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting occurred at about 9 p.m. in front of about 100 to
200 people, said Police Chief Leonard Gallo.
</P>
<P>
   The woman was seated in a lawn chair when the man walked up
behind her and fired one shot into the back of her head, police
said. He then walked a short distance away and shot himself in the
head, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The shooter, who appeared to be in his 70s, died at the scene,
Gallo said. His victim was in critical condition at a local
hospital, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Their identities had not been released Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sounded like fireworks,'' said Phil Carrano, who was
attending the concert. ''Within ten seconds, not even, everyone
started to scatter. People took out their cell phones, and that's
when we knew they were shots, they were not fireworks.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Joseph Maturo called the shooting ''devastating''
</P>
<P>
   ''We do have stress management to help the witnesses,'' he said.
''This was supposed to be a fun night. This was supposed to be a
nice night.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Confirms Norman Mineta  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate has confirmed Norman Mineta, a
former House member and defense contractor executive, to President
Clinton's Cabinet as secretary of commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate confirmed Mineta, who will be the first
Asian-American Cabinet member, on a voice vote late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment will be for only six months, through the end of
Clinton's term. Mineta succeeds William Daley, who recently left to
run Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At his confirmation hearing this week, Mineta said he intends to
work on keeping the economy growing, developing new foreign markets
for American business, helping develop technology, rebuilding
fisheries and keeping the Commerce Department accessible and
accountable.
</P>
<P>
   Mineta, 68, a Japanese-American who spent his childhood in a
Wyoming internment camp during World War II, represented the
Silicon Valley area of northern California in the House for 21
years. He rose to become chairman of the House Public Works and
Transportation Committee in 1993 but lost the seat after
Republicans won control of the House in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He resigned in 1995 to join Lockheed Martin Corp., the nation's
largest defense contractor, as senior vice president of its
transportation systems and services division.

<HEADLINE> House Approves Privacy Amendment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House approved an amendment Thursday
directing the Treasury Department, Postal Service and other federal
agencies to show how they collect personal information from
visitors to their Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment addresses fears that federal Web sites threaten
privacy by tracking a visitor's progress through the site and
collecting identifiable data.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the federal government is collecting information about our
personal habits, we have a right to know about it so that we can
stop any inappropriate invasion of privacy,'' said Rep. Jay Inslee,
D-Wash., who introduced the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the Clinton administration issued strict rules
regulating ''cookies,'' small text files placed on a person's
computer. Cookies are frequently used to track Web site visitors,
or to personalize a Web site based on the visitor's preferences.
The rules directed all federal agencies to review their compliance
with existing Web privacy policies, and to submit descriptions of
how they handle Internet privacy issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Inslee amendment was added by voice vote to a Treasury
appropriations bill. It also affects the Internal Revenue Service,
the U.S. Customs Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate not yet taken up the issue.

<HEADLINE> Man Convicted of Murder in R.I.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- A man was convicted of murder Thursday
despite the slaying of the key prosecution witness on the eve of
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Pona was convicted of last August's shooting death of
Hector Feliciano, which police described as drug-related.
</P>
<P>
   The key witness, Jennifer Rivera, 15, was shot outside her home
in May, but the jury was able to hear her on tape saying Pona was
the man she saw fleeing the scene of the murder.
</P>
<P>
   The identification was crucial in what was otherwise a
circumstantial case. During their deliberations, the jurors, who
were told Jennifer had been killed, asked to hear the girl's
testimony played again.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's most important today is that Jennifer Rivera's murder
did not allow the killer of Hector Feliciano to go unpunished,''
Attorney General Sheldon Whitehouse said on the courthouse steps.
''Her voice rang out loud and clear in the courtroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Pona's attorneys did not speak with reporters when leaving the
courthouse and did not return calls to their offices. Their motion
for a new trial will be heard July 26.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has been charged with Jennifer's slaying.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Governor Talks With Miller  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes has discussed the
state's vacant Senate seat with his predecessor, Zell Miller,
political sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Sources in both political parties said the two men met
Wednesday, one day after the death of Republican Sen. Paul
Coverdell. There was no indication whether Barnes offered to use
his authority under state law to appoint Miller to the Senate
pending a special election on Nov. 6.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 68, has not indicated an interest in returning to public
life since leaving office in January 1999. He declined earlier in
the week to discuss the vacancy.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, 61, succumbed on Tuesday to the effects of a cerebral
hemorrhage. Discreet maneuvering over the vacancy began even before
memorial services scheduled for this weekend in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Among Republicans, several sources identified Rep. Johnny
Isakson as a potential candidate. In an interview, Isakson declined
to discuss the race. ''It's not really an appropriate time,'' he
said. ''There's a time and place for everything, but this isn't
it.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP Rep. Jack Kingston said he had received calls asking if he
was going to run, ''but I'm still in the shellshocked stage of
grief.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Democrats, Rep. John Lewis, a veteran of the civil rights
movement, signaled an interest, as did other political figures in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller, 68, who served two terms as governor, also surfaced
quickly in the speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to talk about anything like that,'' he said
earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans currently control the Senate with a majority of
54-45. While Democrats are well-positioned to gain seats in the
fall elections, Coverdell's death creates an opening that could
permit them to creep closer, if not challenge the GOP for control.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, several Democrats, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said during the day they hoped Miller could be persuaded to accept
appointment and then run in the November election.

<HEADLINE> Alabama Temps Break 100 Again  </HEADLINE>
By JAY REEVES
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) -- With only two little fans to cool her
cinderblock home, Willie Shepard sweltered along with the rest of
the sun-baked South on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 78-year-old woman finally gave up on getting cool inside the
six-room house and moved instead to the circle of shade under a
small tree, hoping to catch a noontime breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Wiping away sweat, Shepard recalled her fitful sleep the night
before. ''I got so hot I went and put my head in the
refrigerator,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In a record-breaking heat wave already blamed for at least 16
deaths across the region, Shepard's hometown of Tuscaloosa was an
oven turned on high. On Thursday, the temperature broke the
100-degree mark for the 16th straight day.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the afternoon, Tuscaloosa and much of Alabama got some
badly needed relief as a line of thunderstorms rolled through the
state, dropping temperatures as much as 30 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-moving storm, with winds up to 60 mph, brought
Tuscaloosa almost as much rain -- 1.67 inches -- as the city had seen
in two months.
</P>
<P>
   Storms in Arkansas also brought wind gusts as high as 80 mph.
The mother of a state senator was killed when a tree was blown onto
her car.
</P>
<P>
   Much more rain is still needed to overcome the extreme drought
that is killing crops across much of the South, forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
   The two weeks of blistering heat have been blamed for at least
12 deaths in Texas and four in Louisiana. Forecasters said most
areas should cool down heading into the weekend, but only by a few
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   About 8,500 homes and businesses in Tulsa, Okla., lost power
Thursday during a thunderstorm that signaled an approaching front.
In Texas, Dallas County remained under an emergency health alert
prompted by temperatures above 100 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, temperatures have been running five to 10 degrees
above normal. Columbus has been the state's hot spot, with 100-plus
temperatures for six days.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuscaloosa, the county welfare office has seen an increase in
cases of neglect of the elderly, possibly because the heat has made
people too stressed or tired to take care of others. More than 20
instances of neglect have been reported in the last month, about
twice as many as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's the heat,'' said Ken Sanders, adult services
supervisor for the Tuscaloosa County Department of Human Resources.
''After a while, people begin to get heat fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   While the South baked, it was still sweater weather in Michigan.
Temperatures in the southeastern part of the state have averaged 14
degrees below normal this month -- and all-time July lows were set
Wednesday in two cities in the Upper Peninsula: 34 in Manistique
and 36 in Escanaba.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Plan To Kill Seaweed  </HEADLINE>
By KIMBERLY LAMKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Marine researchers plan to use chlorine to
poison an aggressive algae that invaded a Southern California
lagoon and threatens to spread and destroy coastal habitat
statewide.
</P>
<P>
   The chlorine will also destroy most life in the lagoon, but is
an essential strategy to prevent the spread of the algae,
researchers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This species is devastating to ecosystems,'' said Bob Hoffman
of the National Marine Fisheries Service for Southern California.
''If it were to get into the coastal reefs, fishery and
invertebrate populations would be severely affected, if not
destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   The algae, Caulerpa taxifolia, ruined more than 10,000 acres of
Mediterranean Sea marine habitat near France, Spain, Monaco and
Italy after patches found in the 1980s were not immediately
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Caulerpa, while not a danger to humans, is toxic to most sea
life, forcing fish to go elsewhere and harming fisheries. It is so
hardy it can live for 10 days out of water and 30 days without
sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Divers helping monitor habitat for a nearby power plant
discovered the algae on June 12 in the lagoon, 20 miles north of
San Diego. Recently, the largest patch measured 60 feet by 30 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers believe the algae got into the lagoon when someone
dumped the contents of their aquarium into a storm drain or into
the lagoon itself.
</P>
<P>
   They have not found the algae anywhere else, and to stop its
spread, workers have cordoned off a large part of the lagoon,
leaving a buffer zone to prevent boaters from spreading the bright
green, fern-like plant.
</P>
<P>
   To eradicate it, workers will use tarps to enclose the algae
patches, then administer chlorine, said Rachel Woodfield, the
marine biologist who identified the species in the lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   Eradication is expected to take at least three months. Officials
said the cost is still unknown.

<HEADLINE> Court Rules on Tourette Suit  </HEADLINE>
By DEE-ANN DURBIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- A grocery store acted legally when it
fired an employee whose Tourette's syndrome caused him to swear at
customers, the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We find it ridiculous to expect a business ... to tolerate
this type of language in the presence of its customers, even though
we understand that because of plaintiff's condition, his utterance
of obscenities and racial epithets is involuntary,'' the court
wrote in a 3-0 decision.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Petzold, 22, suffers from coprolalia, a rare symptom of
Tourette's that causes him to utter obscenities, particularly when
he is under stress.
</P>
<P>
   Petzold worked as a bagger at a Farmer Jack store in the town of
Hamtramck for 10 months. He was fired in 1996 after one of his
outbursts offended some black customers. Petzold sued Farmer Jack,
saying the company was violating state civil rights laws that
protect the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals said Petzold failed to show that Tourette's
syndrome was unrelated to his ability to perform his job at Farmer
Jack.
</P>
<P>
   ''We emphasize that there certainly are jobs that persons with
TS and coprolalia could perform,'' the court said in its decision.
''However, plaintiff's coprolalia renders him completely
unqualified to perform this particular job, which required
continual contact with members of the general public.''
</P>
<P>
   Petzold's attorney, Michael Cutler, has said he will take the
case all the way to the Supreme Court.
